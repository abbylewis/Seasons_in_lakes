The seasonal variation of lake water level (LWLsv) and storage (LWSsv) reflects the periodic hydrologic fluctuations and related driving forces of the water balances at the basin scale. China, a vastly diverse country that descends from the "Roof of the World" to monsoonal coast zones, hosts a wide distribution of lakes with diverse hydro-climatological and topographic features. Most previous studies focused on monitoring long-term changes of lakes in China, while the seasonality (mostly regarding the lake area) of lake hydrologic dynamics was only investigated for typical lakes or local basins/zones due to the limited spatial coverage and temporal resolution of various observation data. Benefiting from the finer footprints and increased beams of ICESat-2 laser altimeter, we examined the seasonal variations of LWLsv of Chinese lakes (3473 lakes historically larger than 1 km2 during the 1980s-2010s) on a national scale from 2019 to 2021. Then, the machine learning algorithm termed the extreme gradient boosting tree was employed to model the LWLsv of the lakes that were not monitored by ICESat-2. We further quantized the national-scale LWSsv by combining the LWLsv estimates and lake area data. Results show that the mean LWLsv of the 1255 lakes observed by ICESat-2 during 2019-2021 is 0.44 & PLUSMN; 0.07 m. Among them, 1167 lakes have the LWLsv <1 m, and 12 lakes have the LWLsv exceeding 3 m. The accuracy evaluation indicates that the XGBoost model performs well in predicting LWLsv results for unobserved lakes, with the coefficient of determination of 0.76, the mean absolute error of 0.14 m, and the root mean square error of 0.03 m. Overall, the predicted LWLsv of unobserved lakes has a similar spatial pattern to that of the observed lakes. The LWSsv is estimated at 77.29 & PLUSMN; 6.87 Gt in total, but exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity in China. The Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River Basin and the endorheic Qiangtang Plateau Basin rank the first two contributors of the net LWSsv, which were respectively attributed to the most significant LWLsv changes and the largest lake group area. This national-scale quantification of the LWLsv and LWSsv helps advance our scientific understanding of the seasonal hydrologic behaviors for Chinese lakes in regulating the water cycle and providing a valuable reference for regional water resource management.					; Ke, Linghong/NVM-2414-2025; Liu, Kai/HWQ-3608-2023; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012	Liu, Kai/0000-0002-5500-0644; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				AUG 15	2023	294								113657	10.1016/j.rse.2023.113657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113657		JUN 2023											WOS:001015341700001

With the development of urbanization in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China, the environmental pollution of microplastics is becoming an increasingly prominent issue. Here, the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics, sources, and ecological risks of microplastics were analyzed in water from an urban lake, Xinghu Lake, as well as the contribution of rivers. Importantly, the roles of urban lakes for microplastics were demonstrated through the investigations of contributions and fluxes for microplastic in rivers. The results showed that the average abundances of microplastics in water of Xinghu Lake were 4.8 +/- 2.2 and 10.1 +/- 7.6 particles/m3 in wet and dry seasons, and the average contribution degree of the inflow rivers was 75%. The size of microplastics in water from Xinghu Lake and its tributaries was concentrated in the range of 200-1000 mu m. In general, the average comprehensive potential ecological risk indexes of microplastics in water were 247 +/- 120.6 and 273.1 +/- 353.7 in wet and dry seasons, which the high ecological risks of them were found through the adjusted evaluation method. There were also mutual effects among microplastic abundance, the concentrations of total nitrogen and organic carbon. Finally, Xinghu Lake has been a sink for microplastics both in wet and dry seasons, and it would be a source of microplastics under the influence of extreme weather and anthropogenic factors.

The vertical migration of cyanobacteria in the water column increases the uncertainty in the formation and disappearance of blooms, which may be closely associated with light, temperature, and wind speed. However, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the influencing factors of cyanobacteria vertical movement in natural environment compared to the laboratory experimental environment. Besides, both field survey and laboratory experiment method have the difficulties in determining the diurnal vertical migration of cyanobacteria at the synoptic lake scale. In this study, based on the diurnal dynamics of cyanobacterial bloom intensity (CBI) observed by the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) from 2011 to 2019, the daily variations, floating rate, and sinking rate of Microcystis aeruginosa were calculated in the natural environment. Then, the effects of light, temperature, and wind speed on the vertical migration of M. aeruginosa were analysed from the perspectives of day, night, and season. The results are as follows: the records of three typical patterns of diurnal CBI exhibited strong seasonal variability from the 9-year statistics; at night, the buoyancy recovery rate of cyanobacterial colonies increased with temperature, so that at temperature > 15 ? and wind speed < 3 m s(-1), CBI reached the maximum of the whole day at 08:16; the sinking rate of M. aeruginosa was positively correlated with the cumulated light energy at both synoptic and pixel scale; the upward migration speed of M. aeruginosa was positively correlated with the maximum wind speed of the day before cyanobacterial bloom. Therefore, the severer cyanobacterial blooms were often observed by satellite images after strong winds. The analysis of diurnal variation, floating rate, and sinking rate of M. aeruginosa will expand our knowledge for further understanding the formation mechanism of cyanobacterial blooms and for improving the accuracy of model simulation to predict the hourly changes in cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu.					; Lyu, Heng/F-3335-2017; Bi, Shun/MSY-5753-2025	Guo, Fei/0000-0002-5115-7249; Li, Junda/0000-0002-0329-8741; Bi, Shun/0000-0002-2668-5808													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 15	2022	310								114734	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114734		FEB 2022						35220103					WOS:000781102100006

Little is known about their ice processes and thermal regimes. Seasonal ice mass balance, thermal regime and stratification of under-ice water were investigated in a shallow thermokarst lake in central QTP using in situ observations and global reanalysis data. Congelation ice grew to 60-70 cm depth while continuous surface sublimation caused a total ice loss of over 30 cm. The bulk lake temperature below ice remained above 3.0 degrees C through the ice freezing period and rose gradually up to 7-9 degrees C during the melting period. The vertical thermal structure of under-ice water consisted of a stable strongly stratified interfacial layer (IL) and an underlying convective layer reaching the lake bottom. A warm layer existed just beneath the IL since the middle equilibrium period and increased in thickness and temperature. There was seasonal variation of IL depth and temperature gradient in response to the ice thermodynamics and atmospheric conditions. The calculated daily water-ice heat flux (F-w) was of 10 W m(-2) magnitude. Seasonal variation of F-w manifested both diffusive and convective heat transport to the ice-water interface. This study suggests that strong penetration of solar radiative flux is the dominant contributor to high F-w which results in a relatively thin ice compared with other equivalent high-latitude climate.					; Li, Zhijun/A-5299-2019; Zhang, Jinrong/ACM-0808-2022	Huang, Wenfeng/0000-0001-6694-1194; Lin, Zhanju/0000-0001-6557-9998; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2019	578								124122	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124122													WOS:000497250200087

Carla			Nonlinear rainfall effects on savanna fire activity across the African Humid Period	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Fire is a key ecosystem process in tropical and subtropical savannas, with a varying role that depends on hydroclimate but also on feedbacks between fire and vegetation. In savannas, fire response to changes in rainfall depends on mean annual rainfall: in arid and semi-arid systems, burned area increases as rainfall increases fuel amount, whereas in mesic systems with high fuel moisture, burned area decreases as rainfall increases. The non-linear relationship between burned area and rainfall may be due in part to changes in the constraints on fire activity that shift the limiting factor for burning in savannas from fuel amount to fuel moisture with increasing rainfall and decreasing seasonality. Vegetation-fire feedbacks can also promote a shift from fire-prone savanna vegetation to forest taxa that suppress fire as rainfall increases. However, modern observations are, by definition, constrained to short-term dynamics, and the longer-term effects of precipitation changes on fire activity have not been evaluated. These longer-term impacts are especially relevant for evaluating biome transitions changing in response to variable hydroclimate and fire activity. The Late Pleistocene and early Holocene African Humid Period (AHP;-14.5 e5.5 ka), when rainfall increased substantially across northern and equatorial Africa, provides an op-portunity to examine long-term fire responses to increased precipitation at sites with different mean annual rainfall amounts. Here, we combine new polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) records of paleofire activity at two East African lake basins (Lakes Victoria and Turkana) with previously published fire records (i.e., charcoal, levoglucosan) at five sites (GeoB7920-2, GeoB9508-5, Lakes Chala, Tanganyika and Bosumtwe) to examine responses of fire activity along a rainfall gradient (from <200 mm to 1500 mm). Our synthesis reveals fire dynamics that are consistent with modern ecosystem dynamics and shows that fire activity at each site followed predicted patterns across the AHP depending on initial mean rainfall, with increased fire activity at arid to semi-arid sites and decreased fire activity at mesic-to-humid sites. Results illustrate that fire responses to hydroclimate are nonlinear, such that the same di-rection of change in precipitation can elicit different fire responses depending on the total precipitation at a site. Accounting for heterogeneity in hydroclimate, even within biomes, may improve predictions of how fire activity will respond to future changes in rainfall regimes.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Medina, M; Huffaker, R; Jawitz, JW; Muñoz-Carpena, R				Medina, Miles; Huffaker, Ray; Jawitz, James W.; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael			Seasonal dynamics of terrestrially sourced nitrogen influenced Karenia brevis blooms off Florida's southern Gulf Coast	HARMFUL ALGAE												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) threaten coastal ecological systems, public health, and local economies, but the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes that culminate in HABs vary by locale and are often poorly understood. Despite broad recognition that cultural eutrophication may exacerbate nearshore bloom events, the association is typically not linear and is often difficult to quantify. Off the Gulf Coast of Florida, Karenia brevis blooms initiate in the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and advection of cells supplies nearshore blooms. However, past work has struggled to describe the relationship between terrestrial nutrient runoff and bloom maintenance near the Gulf Coast. This study applied a novel nonlinear time series (NLTS) analytical framework to investigate whether nearshore bloom dynamics observed near Charlotte Harbor, FL were causally and systematically driven by terrestrially sourced inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus, and freshwater between 2012 and 2018. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) isolated low-dimensional, deterministic signals in K. brevis log(10)-density dynamics and in the dynamics of nine of 10 candidate drivers. The predominantly seasonal K. brevis signal was strong, explaining 77.6% of the total variance in the observed time series. Causal tests with convergent cross-mapping provided evidence that nitrogen concentrations measured at the discharge point of the Caloosahatchee River systematically influenced K. brevis bloom dynamics. However, further causal testing failed to link these nitrogen dynamics to an upstream basin, possibly due to data limitations. The results support the hypothesis that anthropogenic nitrogen runoff facilitated the growth of K. brevis blooms near Charlotte Harbor and suggest that bloom events would be mitigated by nitrogen source and transport controls within the Caloosahatchee and/or Kissimmee River basins. More broadly, this work demonstrates that management-relevant causal inferences into the drivers of HABs may be drawn from available monitoring records.					; Jawitz, James/G-5819-2013; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael/A-7588-2010	Medina, Miles/0000-0002-4264-6307; Huffaker, Ray/0000-0003-3434-3709; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael/0000-0003-2838-1514													1568-9883	1878-1470				SEP	2020	98								101900	10.1016/j.hal.2020.101900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2020.101900								33129457					WOS:000583196800016

Malawi is one of the countries most susceptible to the impacts of climate change and variability. This paper presents the characteristics of spatio-temporal trends and periodicity of precipitation in Malawi in the period from 1979 to 2015. The analysis was based on recent rain ground gauge data. In total, 31 out of 36 rainfall stations, which include some key stations from the southeast of Malawi, were selected for the study after robust homogeneity tests were applied to the datasets. Spatial distribution of annual mean precipitation showed that high amounts of rainfall are located in areas along the lake and the southeast part of Malawi. The spatial distribution of the wet season (November to April) precipitation from EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Function) analysis revealed ten wet years (1985, 1986, 1989, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2015) and ten dry years (1981, 1983, 1987, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2005, 2011, and 2014). In general, the temporal trends analyses of seasonal (wet season) and annual precipitations both displayed slight decreasing slopes during the 37 years. The trend of precipitation per decade displayed an increase in precipitation during 1980s and 1990s, followed by a decrease in the 21st century. Furthermore, the analysis of the spatial and temporal variability and trends of rainfall showed that northern and central Malawi displayed a clearer variability than southern Malawi. Although the trends of most of the stations are not significant at 95% confidence level, the decreasing rates of rainfall in the last decade and the decreasing trends on wet season and annual scale detected by Mann-Kendall tests require closer monitoring of rainfall changes in the near future. The stations which exhibited significant trends (Naminjiwa and Dedza stations) also call for closer monitoring, since the area relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture for economic sustenance.					; Brian Odhiambo, Ayugi/C-3372-2017; Ayugi, Brian/C-3372-2017	Chen, Dan/0000-0002-4090-136X; Brian Odhiambo, Ayugi/0000-0003-3660-7755; 														2073-4433				SEP	2020	11	9							891	10.3390/atmos11090891	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11090891													WOS:000580699100001

Urban birds including gulls have adapted to exploiting human food resources (refuse) in WMFs, and have thus experienced population explosions worldwide. However, foraging in WMFs for birds may result in exposure to HFRs that have been shown to be toxic for animals. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of foraging near or in various WMFs on the atmospheric exposure of birds to HFRs, and to localize other sources of HFRs at the regional scale in a highly urbanized environment. We measured the atmospheric exposure to HFRs in one of the most abundant gull species in North America, the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), breeding in the densely-populated Montreal area (Canada) using a novel approach combining bird-borne GPS dataloggers and miniature passive air samplers (PASs). We determined concentrations of 11 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and three emerging HFRs of high environmental concern in PASs carried by gulls. We show that the daily sampling rates (pg/day) of PBDEs in PASs were highest in gulls foraging in or around landfills, but were not influenced by meteorological variables. In contrast, the daily sampling rates of emerging HFRs were lower compared to PBDEs and were not influenced by the presence of gulls in or near WMFs. This study demonstrates that atmospheric exposure to HFRs and perhaps other semi-volatile contaminants is underestimated, yet important for birds foraging in landfills.					; Giroux, Jean-François/L-7945-2019	Mazerolle, Marc/0000-0002-0486-0310; 													0160-4120	1873-6750				FEB	2020	135								105387	10.1016/j.envint.2019.105387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105387								31841804					WOS:000506229000039
J	Nardin, W; Edmonds, DA				Nardin, William; Edmonds, Douglas A.			Optimum vegetation height and density for inorganic sedimentation in deltaic marshes	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												River deltas support a disproportionate percentage of the world's population and some are drowning as sea level rises(1). Resilient deltas theoretically balance relative sea-level rise with vertical growth from surface sedimentation(2-7). Vegetation generally enhances inorganic sedimentation and resiliency in some settings, such as tidal saltwater marshes(8), but the effect of vegetation on freshwater marshes in river deltas is less clear. Here we use a hydrodynamic numerical model(9) to simulate deposition in a river delta with varying vegetation characteristics and water discharge and show that vegetation does not always enhance sedimentation on a freshwater marsh. For a given flood, we find that intermediate vegetation height and density are optimal for enhancing both sand and mud deposition, whereas tall or dense vegetation causes sand to remain in the river channel, reducing marsh sedimentation. A multivariate regression analysis of remote-sensing data from Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana, USA shows that the delta exhibits a hydrodynamic response to vegetation in agreement with model predictions. Because most sediment is delivered to freshwater deltaic marshes by infrequent storm and flood events, we further suggest that the timing of such events relative to seasonal vegetation growth determines the integrated effect of vegetation on delta resiliency.

It is not yet conclusive whether intensive rice-wheat rotation system contributes to N pollution in the surrounding water systems in the Taihu Lake region (TLR). We conducted a three-year field experiments to monitor N runoff and leaching from rice-wheat paddy soil. Annual N runoff and leaching was in the range of 55.3-93.1 kg N ha(-1), with a mean of ca. 69.2 kg N ha(-1). Of the total N export to water systems, 82-93% was from N runoff and only 7-18% was from N leaching. For seasonal distribution, the wheat season contributed 57-85% of total N, while the rice season contributed 15-43%. Because of different water practices, N runoff and leaching exhibited completely different patterns in two crop seasons. Considerable N runoff in wheat season can mainly be attributed to moderately heavy rainfall and accelerated water flow in existing drainage ditches. Large variations in N runoff during rice season were predominantly due to variable natural precipitation and irregular artificial draining. N leaching appeared to be related to fertilization and precipitation in wheat season, while it was associated with fertilization and soil depth during rice season. These field data suggest that runoff dominated N export from rice-wheat rotation under conventional N and water management contributes potentially to water pollution in the TLR.

A space-time geostatistical model for probabilistic estimation of harmful algal bloom biomass and areal extent	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been increasing in intensity worldwide, including the western basin of Lake Erie. Substantial efforts have been made to track these blooms using in situ sampling and remote sensing. However, such measurements do not fully capture HAB spatial and temporal dynamics due to the limitations of discrete shipboard sampling over large areas and the effects of clouds and winds on remote sensing estimates. To address these limitations, we develop a space-time geostatistical modeling framework for estimating HAB intensity and extent using chlorophyll a data sampled during the HAB season (June-October) from 2008 to 2017 by five independent monitoring programs. Based on the Bayesian information criterion for model selection, trend variables explain bloom northerly and easterly expansion from Maumee Bay, wind effects over depth, and variability among sampling methods. Cross validation results demonstrate that space-time kriging explains over half of the variability in daily, location-specific chlorophyll observations, on average. Conditional simulations provide, for the first time, comprehensive estimates of overall bloombiomass (based on depth-integrated concentrations) and surface areal extent with quantified uncertainties. These new estimates are contrasted with previous Lake Erie HAB monitoring studies, and deviations among estimates are explored and discussed. Overall, results highlight the importance of maintaining sufficient monitoring coverage to capture bloom dynamics, as well as the benefits of the proposed approach for synthesizing data from multiple monitoring programs to improve estimation accuracy while reducing uncertainty.

Herein, multi-isotopes (N-15, B-11, O-18, and H-2) and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were used to elucidate the spatiotemporal variation, sources, and patterns of NO3- and its response to groundwater flow in Poyang Lake Basin where agriculture, industry and urban coexist. The location of NO3- hotspots identified by LISA tended to move from the middle to lower reaches of Ganfu Plain with groundwater flow, and hotspots area expanded in the upper reaches of Xin River Basin and northwest of the study area during the transition from dry season to wet season. Our results revealed that variations of regional NO3- concentration were controlled by groundwater recharge or flow mode (vertical or lateral), biogeochemical processes and sources (sewage and manure). In some areas with the single stratigraphic structure (unconfined aquifer), spatiotemporal variation of NO3- concentration was influenced by local pollution sources and vertical recharge of current precipitation (vertical flow). In some areas with binary structures (confined aquifer), groundwater was mainly recharged by lateral flow and NO3- concentration was mainly affected by mixing effect of upstream groundwater, reflecting human activities in the upper reaches rather than local human activities. In lakeside floodplain, groundwater NO3- was attenuated by the dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+. This study provides a novel insight into groundwater flow controlling on spatiotemporal distribution of NO3- concentration in the regional scale.

Large Fine-Scale Spatiotemporal Variations of CH4 Diffusive Fluxes From Shrimp Aquaculture Ponds Affected by Organic Matter Supply and Aeration in Southeast China	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mariculture shrimp ponds are important CH4 sources to the atmosphere. However, the spatiotemporal variations of CH4 concentration and flux at fine spatial scales in mariculture ponds are poorly known, particularly in China, worlds largest aquaculture producer. In this study, the plot-scale spatiotemporal variations of water CH4 concentration and flux, both within and among ponds, were researched in shrimp ponds in Shanyutan wetland, Min River Estuary, Southeast China. The average water CH4 concentration and diffusion flux across the water-air interface in the shrimp ponds over the shrimp aquaculture period varied from 2.290.29 to 50.4820.91 mu M and from 0.090.01 to 2.320.95mmolm(-2)hr(-1), respectively. The CH4 emissions from the estuarine ponds varied greatly between seasons, with peaks in August and September, which was similar to the trend of water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations. There was no remarkable difference in CH4 concentration and flux between shrimp ponds but significantly spatiotemporal differences in CH4 concentration and flux within the ponds. Significantly higher emissions occurred in the feeding zone, accounting for approximately 60% of total CH4 emission flux, while much lower CH4 emissions appeared in aeration zone, contributing 14% to total flux. This study suggests the importance of considering spatiotemporal variation in the whole-pond estimates of CH4 concentration and flux. In light of such high spatial variation within ponds, improving aeration and feed utilization efficiency would help to mitigate CH4 emissions from mariculture ponds.

The decomposition of the settled algal biomass may affect nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles and thereby N loss in sediments. In this study, we investigated sediment denitrification N-loss patterns along algal migration pathway in Taihu Lake, a shallow and eutrophic lake in China, and found that wind-induced algal migration in the overlying water manipulated the temporal and spatial patterns of denitrification N-loss in sediments. A N loss hotspot in sediments was created in the algae concentrated zone, where N loss was, however, temporarily inhibited during algal bloom seasons and generally exhibited a negative relationship with algal biomass. In the zone where algae have left, sediment N loss rate was relatively low and positively correlated with algal biomass. The decay of algal biomass generated organic carbon and created anoxia, favoring denitrification, while excessive algal biomass could deplete oxygen and inhibit nitrification, causing nitrate limitation for denitrification. Piecewise linear regression analysis indicated that algal biomass of Chl-a > 73.0 mu g/L in the overlying water could inhibit denitrification N-loss in sediments. This study adds to our understanding of N biogeochemical cycles in shallow eutrophic lakes.					wenqing, shi/JCO-4345-2023; Deng, Jianming/AAN-2998-2020; Van Dam, Bryce/LPP-5347-2024; Van Dam, Bryce/AAG-9220-2019; Zhou, Jian/HHS-9262-2022; Smyth, Ashley/KQU-6245-2024	Van Dam, Bryce/0000-0003-0876-1392; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB 1	2022	209								117887	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117887	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117887		NOV 2021						34839067					WOS:000724975900010

It allows assessing lake lifetime and can be used to design improved catchment management plans. Over the past few years, we collected sediment and runoff discharge data at fine spatial-temporal resolutions for the Lake Tana Basin (LTB), Ethiopia. Based on these data, this study presents a consolidated sediment budget of Lake Tana, following the proof of concept by Lemma et al. (2018). Sediment yield (SY) was quantified for 15 rivers and 2 lake outlets based on 12,671 suspended sediment concentration (SSC) samples, making this the most complete dataset for Lake Tana. In particular, we investigated seasonal and temporal patterns of sediment dynamics and the role of lakeshore floodplains. The latter was done by comparing the SSC measurements at upper and lower borders of the floodplains. Sediment rating curves were prepared that account for land cover conditions and rainfall seasonality. SY calculations for the main contributing rivers take bedload fluxes into account by means of a bedload rating curve. As a result, the gross annual sediment mass mobilized on the hillslopes of LTB was 33.30 Mt (9.93 Mt from ungauged rivers), dominantly from large river catchments in the southern and eastern parts of LTB. SSC and SY are generally larger at the beginning of the rainfed cropping calendar (May-June). By the end of rainfed cropping calendar (September-October), SY decreases. Floodplains store 2.28 Mt suspended sediment whereas annually an average SY of 31.02 Mt entered the lake. From this, 96.6% is suspended load and 3.4% is bedload. With ca. 30 Mt sediment deposited in the lake, its mean trapping efficiency equals 97%. Only 1.14 Mt of sediment leaves the lake through the two outlets. The rate of lake sedimentation (9.8 kg m-2 yr-1) is in line with the sedimentation rates of large lakes in the world. However, because Lake Tana is shallow, its expected lifetime is only 918 years. Moreover, this study is useful for managing freshwater ecosystems that requires understanding of sedimentation rate and associated reduction in storage capacity of lakes, especially lakes that are shallow and have experienced extensive catchment degradation.

Simultaneous abrupt shifts in hydrology and fish assemblage structure in a floodplain lake in the central Amazon	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Combined effects of climate change and deforestation have altered precipitation patterns in the Amazon. This has led to changes in the frequency of extreme events of flood and drought in recent decades and in the magnitude of the annual flood pulse, a phenomenon that influences virtually all aspects of river-floodplain ecosystem dynamics. Analysis of long-term data revealed abrupt and synchronous changes in hydrology and fish assemblage structure of a floodplain lake near the confluence of Amazon and Negro rivers. After an intense drought in 2005, the assemblage assumed a different and fairly persistent taxonomic composition and functional structure. Declines in abundance after 2005 were more pronounced for species of all sizes having equilibrium life history strategy, large species with periodic life history strategy, and for all trophic levels except primary consumers. Our results suggest that the extreme drought triggered changes in the fish assemblage and subsequent anomalous hydrological conditions have hampered assemblage recovery. These findings stress the need to account for climatic-driven hydrological changes in conservation efforts addressing aquatic biodiversity and fishery resources in the central Amazon.					; Zuanon, Jansen/E-5791-2013; Amadio, Sidineia/AAG-3359-2020; Röpke, Cristhiana/G-3638-2015; Ferreira, Efrem/J-4570-2014; Ropke, Cristhiana/G-3638-2015	Pires, Tiago/0000-0002-4095-7777; Zuanon, Jansen/0000-0001-8354-2750; Ferreira, Efrem/0000-0003-4027-6207; de Deus, Claudia/0000-0002-5537-7732; Ropke, Cristhiana/0000-0002-3595-5443													2045-2322					JAN 10	2017	7								40170	10.1038/srep40170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep40170								28071701					WOS:000392234400001

Monitoring the stability of tailings facility is therefore indispensable for sustainable mining development. Particularly, tailings experience gradual consolidation settlement as the pore pressure dissipates and the terrain subsides. However, field investigations and geotechnical analysis at tailings impoundment are limited by sparse field instrumentation due to high cost. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide a full spatial view of settlement rate at millimeter-scale precision with bi-weekly or monthly updates. Here we integrate big remotely sensed data including multi-temporal and multi-spaceborne SAR images of ENVISAT, ALOS PALSAR-1, and Sentinel-1A, and SRTM DEM and LIDAR DEM, as well as water level data, to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement over the tailings impoundment area in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake, Utah. We show that the reclaimed south pond is experiencing enormous quasi-linear settlements with the largest rate of 200 + mm/yr around the low-permeable decant pond clay at the northeast corner during 2004-2011, and the rate decreases to 100 + mm/yr during 2015-2016. The nearly decadal InSAR measurements can be well-explained by geotechnical consolidation model, which reveals the long-term exponentially decaying settlement and predicts the settlement process in the near future. InSAR-derived displacement maps also highlight active motions of surrounding infrastructures, such as some highway segments. There is no clear evidence that the fluctuating deformation at those locations and seasonal varied water level are correlated. Our results demonstrate that high resolution surface displacement measurements from InSAR can significantly improve our understanding of tailings settlement process and facilitate the monitoring of dams/infrastructures stability.

Due to climate change, it is advisable to identify the vulnerable area and to investigate if the local reservoir network of hundreds of larger reservoirs and thousands of smaller reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate-induced hydrologic variation. Therefore, the local high-density reservoir network is integrated into a distributed hydrologic model (HMS) through a fully coupled reservoir module. We then apply the extended HMS in a one-way coupled mode to the bias corrected Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment in East Asia (CORDEX-EA) regional climate simulations under two Representative Concentration Pathways - RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results indicate that climate change poses new challenges to water resources management for the PLB, with a likely decrease of water availability in the dry season but an increase of water availability, flood magnitude and flood frequency in the flood season till 2049. The local reservoir network can mitigate climate impacts by displacing excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season and mitigating floods across the basin. Despite that, much of the southern basin is likely to see a higher risk of water shortage in the dry season, while most of the northern basin is expected to see a higher flood risk. The approach and findings are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs in the context of climate change, and provide implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies on a regional scale.

However, the dynamic nature of N and its propensity for loss have made N fertilizer management a great challenge for paddy systems. In this field study (2012-2015), we investigated N dynamics in various components of N budgets, i.e., fertilizer, rainfall and irrigation as N inputs and crop harvests, ammonia (NH3) volatilization and surface runoff as major N exports, in a typical paddy irrigation-drainage unit (IDU) in Hubei province, China. Moreover, N in paddy field ponding water and ditch water was also monitored. The mass balance of N for the rice season showed a net retention of 45.6 +/- 7.5 kg N ha(-1) season(-1). Notably, wet deposition (19.5 +/- 6.7 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) accounted for 11% of total N input to the paddy field. NH3 volatilization was the main environmental N loss pathway (mean 34.1 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)); equivalent to 25.3% of N fertilizer application. With regard to N loss, the first week after fertilization is the critical period for NH3 volatilization loss, high total N concentration in the field ponding water and in runoff water. There was about nine days lag between the peaks of N concentrations in paddy field water and in ditch water. In contrast to that of the paddy field, the critical period of N loss from the IDU was 16 days after fertilization. After this period, N concentrations in ditch water declined and stabilized at a low level. Overall, our results suggest that most of the N loss from paddy runoff can be reduced during its delivery from the field to ditches. We suggest best management practices be targeted at the critical loss processes and critical periods in the IDU.

Dissolved organic matter adsorption from surface waters by granular composites versus granular activated carbon columns: An applicable approach	WATER RESEARCH												Many new sorbents have been introduced as an alternative for granular activated carbon (GAC), the most common sorbent for dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal. In the current study, we developed an applicable granular composite based on a flocculant commonly employed for drinking water treatment adsorbed to montmorillonite. DOM adsorption from surface waters, Lake Kinneret and Suwannee River, with low and high specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVA), respectively, by composite and GAC columns, was studied. Adsorption of DOM from Suwannee River was significantly higher by the composite column, in comparison to the GAC column, while an opposite trend was obtained for the adsorption of DOM from Lake Kinneret. In-situ regeneration of the columns with a brine solution was extremely efficient and inefficient for the composite and GAC columns, respectively. Adsorption, of both waters, postregeneration by the composite column was not compromised, while GAC effectiveness decreased. The opposite trend in DOM adsorption from Suwannee River and Lake Kinneret was explained by the different affinities of the sorbents towards various DOM molecules. Distinguishing between different DOM components adsorbed by GAC and the composite was supported by C-13 NMR and direct pyrolysisGC-MS measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the kinetics and adsorption at the equilibrium of five organic molecules to the composite and GAC can be correlated to their chemical-physical properties. Indeed, combining the properties of both sorbents, by integrating them into a single column, yielded higher DOM removal than by the individual columns. Furthermore, since DOM removal by GAC and by the composite, increases, and decreases with temperature, respectively, the integrated column, mitigates the changes in removal, stabilizing the adsorption performance. Such an integrated filter may minimize additional seasonal and water quality fluctuations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, a PC index (PCI) is defined as remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr(-1)) at 620 nm normalized against a baseline formed linearly between Rrs(560) and Rrs(665). Because PC has a local absorption peak at similar to 620 nm, PCI is shown in both theory and model simulations to exhibit a monotonic functional relationship with PC concentration. Field measurements also support this hypothesis, from which an empirical algorithm is developed to estimate PC concentrations between similar to 1 and 300 mu g/L with unbiased RMS uncertainties of 58%. Radiative transfer simulations further show that such a field-based algorithm can be applied directly to MERIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) after adjusting algorithm coefficients. Spectral analyses and image comparisons indicate that such an algorithm is nearly immune to perturbations from thick aerosols, thin clouds, significant sun glint, and extreme water turbidity. Mean usable data coverage increases from <1% to >50% when using Rrc as compared to Rrs processed using standard atmospheric correction algorithms in SeaDAS. The robust algorithm performance and significantly improved data coverage lead to the establishment of a long-term (2002-2012) time-series of PC concentrations in Taihu Lake, which show both seasonal and inter-annual changes. Test of the algorithm over other lakes, including Dianchi Lake (a typical plateau lake of China), suggests that the same band-subtraction approach might be applicable to other inland water bodies, although local bio-optical conditions due to different sediment and phytoplanlcton compositions need to be considered when applying such an empirical approach.

Here, this challenge was addressed using partial wavelet coherency (PWC), which can detect localized and scale-specific bivariate relationships between predictor and response variables after removing the impact of other variables. The analysis was done for groundwater systems in a humid area (Tuscaloosa, Alabama) and an arid area (Lake Havasu City, Arizona). The results indicate that the total precipitation and precipitation duration show the advantage in controlling the groundwater flow in humid and arid areas, respectively. Precipitation has more significant impacts on the coherence between surface water and groundwater in an arid area, which decreases by 3% on small time scales (< 120 days) and increases by 6% on large scales (> 120 days). However, surface water shows more important effects on the coherence between precipitation and groundwater on large scales in a humid area, which decreases by 47%. Overall, the analysis highlights that the impacts of precipitation (or surface water) on the coherence between surface water (or precipitation) and groundwater level are changing with the time scale and climatic belt. The temporal scale dependency is primarily led by the seasonality of the influence factors, while the spatial dependency is mainly due to various evapotranspiration rates and drought/flood episodes. These findings provide useful insights into untangling the localized and scale-specific bivariate relationships in a groundwater system, which is an important topic in water-resource prediction.

Mercury in Active-Layer Tundra Soils of Alaska: Concentrations, Pools, Origins, and Spatial Distribution	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Tundra soils serve as major sources of mercury (Hg) input to the Arctic Ocean via river runoff and coastal erosion; yet little information is available on tundra soil Hg concentrations, pool sizes, origins, and dynamics. We present a detailed investigation of Hg in the active layer (upper similar to 100cm subject to seasonal thaw) of tundra soils across 11 sites in Alaska. Soil Hg concentrations in organic horizons (151 +/- 7 mu g/kg) were in the upper range of temperate soil organic horizons, and concentrations in mineral horizons (98 +/- 6 mu g/kg) were much higher than in temperate soils. Soil Hg concentrations declined from inland to coastal sites, in contrast to a hypothesized northward increase expected because of proximity to coastal atmospheric mercury depletion events. Principle component analyses and elemental ratios results show that exogenic sources dominated over geogenic sources-in A-horizons (664%) and mineral B-horizons (51 +/- 1%). C-14 age-dating suggested recent origins of Hg in surface soils but showed that mineral soils (more than 7,300years old) must have accumulated atmospheric inputs across millennia leading to high soil concentrations and pools. We estimated a total Northern Hemisphere active-layer tundra soil Hg pool of 184 Gg (range of 136 to 274 Gg), suggesting a globally important Hg storage pool. Tundra soils are subject to seasonal thaw and freeze dynamics, thereby providing large inputs to rivers, lakes, and the Arctic Ocean. Understanding processes that mobilize Hg from tundra soils will be critical to understanding future Arctic wildlife and human Hg exposures.

However, the mechanisms of internal nutrient cycling, specifically the feedback of algal blooms on nutrients cycling is still an open question. Management of Lake Dianchi, the most eutrophic lake in China, has involved a series of costly measures but without significant algal bloom decreasing. In view of the difficulty to evaluate the importance of internal cycling only by monitoring data, a three-dimensional model-based flux tracking approach was performed to identify the contributions of internal cycling. The results highlighted the role of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) benthic fluxes with high seasonal fluctuations, contributing similar to 29 %(N) and similar to 18 %(P) of total input. The scenario analysis indicated that N loading reduction was more efficient for lake restoration. Furthermore, A positive feedback was detected between algae biomass and benthic P flux. Benthic P flux varied from adsorption to release when algae biomass increased. This phenomenon implied that a close link existed between N and P cycles with algae acting as a strong integrator. Due to the positive feedback loop between benthic P flux and algal blooms as well as the high efficiency of N loading reduction, controlling both N and P loadings will benefit lake restoration, especially eutrophic lakes with heavy sediment nutrient loadings.

Satellite observations from the CZCS, SeaWiFS, and MODIS-Aqua sensors have been used in tandem with long term records of Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) to provide a retrospective analysis of spatial and temporal variations in water clarity over the Great Lakes. A simple empirical algorithm is presented, relating Z(SD) to remote-sensing reflectance at approximate to 550 nm (R-rs approximate to 550). Results suggest remarkable and complex changes in water clarity over the Great Lakes. Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan have seen increases in average Z(SD) over the three sensor periods of 58%, 49%, and 62%, respectively. Lake Erie shows highly variable Z(SD) with no consistent long term trends, while Lake Superior has remained fairly consistent in its lake-wide water clarity conditions. Temporal trends document the decrease in whiting events on Lake Michigan while capturing the ongoing occurrence of these seasonal bright-water events on Lake Ontario. Results indicate a divergence in Z(SD) trends between nearshore and offshore environments; with larger increases in offshore than nearshore Z(SD) and some nearshore areas suggesting a decrease in Z(SD). Offshore regions of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior show diminished Z(SD) seasonality in contrast to increasing seasonal variance in the nearshore. Spatial and temporal variations in Z(SD) are in agreement with documented reductions in Great Lakes bioproductivity, degrading nearshore water quality, and changing biogeochemical processes influencing whiting events and sediment resuspension.

J	Chu, VW				Chu, Vena W.			Greenland ice sheet hydrology: A review	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												Understanding Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) hydrology is essential for evaluating response of ice dynamics to a warming climate and future contributions to global sea level rise. Recently observed increases in temperature and melt extent over the GrIS have prompted numerous remote sensing, modeling, and field studies gauging the response of the ice sheet and outlet glaciers to increasing meltwater input, providing a quickly growing body of literature describing seasonal and annual development of the GrIS hydrologic system. This system is characterized by supraglacial streams and lakes that drain through moulins, providing an influx of meltwater into englacial and subglacial environments that increases basal sliding speeds of outlet glaciers in the short term. However, englacial and subglacial drainage systems may adjust to efficiently drain increased meltwater without significant changes to ice dynamics over seasonal and annual scales. Both proglacial rivers originating from land-terminating glaciers and subglacial conduits under marine-terminating glaciers represent direct meltwater outputs in the form of fjord sediment plumes, visible in remotely sensed imagery. This review provides the current state of knowledge on GrIS surface water hydrology, following ice sheet surface meltwater production and transport via supra-, en-, sub-, and proglacial processes to final meltwater export to the ocean. With continued efforts targeting both process-level and systems analysis of the hydrologic system, the larger picture of how future changes in Greenland hydrology will affect ice sheet glacier dynamics and ultimately global sea level rise can be advanced.

Seasonal dynamics of CDOM of the lake are sensitive indicators of the biogeochemical processes and water quality, which are critical to the water security of the lake. Thus, a field investigation of the CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) properties was conducted during four hydrological seasons in 2016 to track the temporal variability of CDOM and DOC properties and to explore the influence of rivers and wetlands on the quantity and quality of CDOM in Poyang Lake. The results showed that the alternations of flood and dry periods have a different influence on the quantity and quality of CDOM and DOC in the main lake and the river mouths districts. DOC and aromaticity in the main lake district were more influenced by seasonal variations, while CDOM concentrations and molecular weight in the river mouths were more affected. CDOM fluorescent components in both these districts varied obviously across the hydrological seasons. More terrestrial humic-like substances with higher aromaticity and lower DOC in the rising and flood season than in the dry and retreating season. The contributing rate of CDOM and its terrestrial humic-like substances from input rivers to the lake in the rising season can account for more than 50%, which was more than that in the flood season. Flooding causes wetlands to contribute a higher abundance of CDOM and DOC with lower aromaticity to the lake, contrary to the CDOM features in the flood season, highlighting the important role of wetlands in the organic carbon pool. The DOC can be modeled using CDOM fluorescent and optical parameters by the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method, which provides a tool for DOC dynamic monitoring and water quality management.

However, many data-driven models are being used to simulate and predict soil moisture at only a single depth. To predict soil moisture at various soil depths with depths of 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm from the surface, based on the weather and soil characteristic data, this study designed two data-driven models: artificial neural networks and long short-term memory models. The developed models are applied to predict daily soil moisture up to 6 days ahead at four depths in the Eagle Lake Observatory in California, USA. The overall results showed that the long short-term memory model provides better predictive performance than the artificial neural network model for all depths. The root mean square error of the predicted soil moisture from both models is lower than 2.0, and the correlation coefficient is 0.80-0.97 for the artificial neural network model and 0.90-0.98 for the long short-term memory model. In addition, monthly based evaluation results showed that soil moisture predicted from the data-driven models is highly useful for analyzing the effects on the water cycle during the wet season as well as dry seasons. The prediction results can be used as basic data for numerous fields such as hydrological study, agricultural study, and environment, respectively.

J	Tian, JY; Ernst, M; Cui, FY; Jekel, M				Tian, Jia-yu; Ernst, Mathias; Cui, Fuyi; Jekel, Martin			Correlations of relevant membrane foulants with UF membrane fouling in different waters	WATER RESEARCH												Correlations between potential fouling-relevant substances and membrane fouling during ultrafiltration (UF) of different waters were investigated, including water samples from Lake Tegel, from a Berlin canal (Landwehrkanal) and from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) secondary effluent. The biopolymers quantified with liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) showed a remarkable correlation with UF membrane fouling for all the three water sources at different seasons. This finding suggests that the biopolymer content in water can be employed as a universal indicator for predicting membrane fouling potential in UF processes. The particulate matter in the two surface waters Lake Tegel and Berlin canal, as characterized by suspended solids and turbidity, also exhibited a distinct correlation with UF membrane fouling, although its correlation was slightly weaker than that of biopolymers. However, the humic substances, which are generally believed to be major membrane foulants, did not show any reliable correlation with the UF membrane fouling of the different waters. This work may provide useful information for the development of optimized fouling control strategies for sustainable UF operation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, Y; Simunek, J; Zhang, ZT; Jing, LF; Ni, LX				Li, Yong; Simunek, Jirka; Zhang, Zhentin; Jing, Longfei; Ni, Lixiao			Evaluation of nitrogen balance in a direct-seeded-rice field experiment using Hydrus-1D	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Nitrogen (N) pollution is a global environmental problem that has greatly increased the risks of both the eutrophication of surface waters and contamination of ground waters. The majority of N pollution mainly comes from agricultural fields, in particular during rice growing seasons. In recent years, a gradual shift from the transplanting rice cultivation method to the direct seeding method has occurred, which results in different water and N losses from paddy fields and leads to distinct impacts on water environments. The N transport and transformations in an experimental direct-seeded-rice (DSR) field in the Taihu Lake Basin of east China were observed during two consecutive seasons, and simulated using Hydrus-1D model. The observed crop N uptake, ammonia volatilization (AV), N concentrations in soil, and N leaching were used to calibrate and validate the model parameters. The two most important inputs of N, i.e., fertilization and mineralization, were considered in the simulations with 220 and 145.5 kg ha(-1) in 2008 and 220 and 147.8 kg ha(-1) in 2009, respectively. Ammonia volatilization and nitrate denitrification were the two dominant pathways of N loss, accounting for about 16.0% and 38.8% of the total N input (TNI), respectively. Both nitrification and denitrification processes mainly occurred in the root zone. N leaching at 60 and 120 cm depths accounted for about 6.8% and 2.7% of TNI, respectively. The crop N uptake was 32.1% and 30.8% of TNI during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, respectively, and ammonium was the predominant form (74% of the total N uptake on average). Simulated N concentrations and fluxes in soil matched well with the corresponding observed data. Hydrus-1D could simulate the N transport and transformations in the DSR field, and could thus be a good tool for designing optimal fertilizer management practices in the future.

However, the spatiotemporal variations, assembly processes, co-occurrence patterns, and environmental interactions of PA and FL bacteria in drinking water reservoirs remain as yet unexplored. To bridge this gap, we collected samples from 10 sites across four seasons in Lake Tianmu, a large drinking water reservoir in China. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries demonstrated spatiotemporal variations in bacterial diversity and identified differences in bacterial community composition (BCC) between PA and FL lifestyles. Capacity for nitrogen respiration, nitrogen fixation, and nitrate denitrification was enriched in the PA lifestyle, while photosynthesis, methylotrophy, and methanol oxidation were enriched in the FL lifestyle. Deterministic processes, including interspecies interactions and environmental filtration, dominated the assembly of both PA and FL bacterial communities. The influence of environmental filtration on the FL community was stronger than that on the PA community, indicating that bacteria in the FL lifestyle were more sensitive to environmental variation. Co-occurrence patterns and keystone taxa differed between PA and FL lifestyles. The ecological functions of keystone taxa in the PA lifestyle were associated with the supply and recycling of nutrients, while those in FL were associated with the degradation of complex pollutants. PA communities were more stable than FL communities in the face of changing environmental conditions. Nutrients (e.g., TDN and NO3-) and abiotic and biotic factors (e.g., WT and Chl-a) exerted positive and negative effects, respectively, on the co-occurrence networks of both lifestyles. These results improve our understanding of assembly processes, co-occurrence patterns, and environmental interactions within PA and FL communities in a drinking water reservoir.

Nitrogen availability increases the toxin quota of a harmful cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa	WATER RESEARCH												An important objective in understanding harmful phytoplankton blooms is determining how environmental factors influence the toxicity of bloom-forming species. We examined how nutrients and grazers (dreissenid mussels) affect the production of microcystin (a liver toxin) by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, via a combination of field and laboratory experiments, and field observations in Lake Erie. The field experiment revealed no effect of mussel density on microcystin quota (particulate microcystin per unit Microcystis biomass). In contrast, in both field and laboratory experiments, nitrogen-limited conditions led to substantially reduced microcystin quota relative to phosphorus-limited or nutrient-saturated conditions. In the field experiment, microcystin per unit of mcyB gene was strongly reduced under nitrogen-limited conditions, indicating a phenotypic response. Results from a seasonal survey in the western basin of Lake Erie revealed a similar negative influence of nitrogen limitation (as indexed by nitrate concentration) on microcystin quota. Our results are consistent with stoichiometric considerations in that the cell quota of a nitrogen-rich secondary metabolite, microcystin, was reduced disproportionately under nitrogen limitation.

To investigate the influence of playa exposure on PM composition, PM samples were collected during two seasons and at two sites around the Salton Sea. To characterize source composition, soil samples were collected from local playa and desert surfaces. PM and soil samples were analyzed for 15 elements using mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. The contribution of sources to PM mass and composition was investigated using Al-referenced enrichment factors (EFs) and source factors resolved from positive matrix factorization (PMF). Playa soils were found to be significantly enriched in Ca, Na, and Se relative to desert soils. PMF analysis resolved the PM10 data with four source factors, identified as Playa-like, Desert-like, Ca-rich, and Se. Playa-like and desert-like sources were estimated to contribute to a daily average of 8.9% and 45% of PMio mass, respectively. Additionally, playa sources were estimated to contribute to 38-68% of PM10 Na. PM10 Se concentrations showed strong seasonal variations, suggesting a seasonal cycle of Se volatilization and recondensation. These results support the importance of playas as a source of PM mass and a controlling factor of PM composition.					; Bahreini, Roya/KEI-5733-2024	Frie, Alexander/0000-0002-9223-8408; Ying, Samantha/0000-0002-1247-2529; Bahreini, Roya/0000-0001-8292-5338													0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 1	2017	51	15					8283	8292		10.1021/acs.est.7b01773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b01773								28697595					WOS:000406982600009

However, the hydrological and ecological drivers of this ecosystem are changing as a result of hydropower development on the Mekong River and global climate change. The objective of this study was to quantify the impacts of the Mekong's future hydrological alterations on aquatic net primary production (NPP) of the Tonle Sap. A three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model was used to evaluate eleven scenarios of hydropower development and climate change, with respect to water flows, suspended sediments, and floodplain habitat cover, which were identified as the key drivers of productivity change. We found that hydropower development would cause the most distinct changes in seasonality by reducing wet season water levels and increasing dry season water levels. Combined scenarios of hydropower and climate change revealed that areas of open water and rainfed/irrigated rice would expand by 35 +/- 3% and 16 +/- 5%, respectively, while optimal area for gallery forest would decrease by 40 +/- 27%. The estimated annual net sedimentation was projected to decrease by 56 +/- 3% from the 3.28 +/- 0.93 million tons baseline values. Annual average NPP in the open water and in the floodplain was 1.07 +/- 0.06 and 3.67 +/- 0.61 million tons C, respectively, and a reduction of 34 +/- 4% is expected. Our study concludes that Tonle Sap's drivers of ecological productivity - habitat cover, sedimentation, and NPP - will face a significant change, and a decline of its ecosystem's services should be expected if mitigation and adaptation strategies are not implemented.

Study focus: This study evaluated the applicability of the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) and the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-AFRICA) datasets for climate change impact assessment. It also evaluated the hydrologic impact of climate change in the sub-basin. The hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was forced with the climate datasets to simulate the reference and future period streamflows under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The seasonality and volumetric deviations of the average annual streamflows simulated using the climate models were used as criteria for selecting members of the ensemble. New hydrological insights for the region: All the climate models in the bias-corrected NEX-GDDP datasets failed to satisfy the criteria. The ensemble average annual streamflows, simulated using the CORDEX-AFRICA dataset, are expected to increase towards the end of the century under both the climate scenarios. However, the ensemble average dry season streamflows are projected to decrease during the mid- and end-periods of the century. The expected decreases in streamflows during the dry and pre-wet seasons, along with excessive abstractions of water from Lake Ziway, would exacerbate water scarcity in the basin. Approaches need to be developed to capture the increase in water availability during the wet season to alleviate water scarcity during the dry season.

The distribution and relative importance of these elements has evolved through time, in response to sustained negative mass balance. The area occupied by perched ponds has expanded upglacier at the expense of supraglacial channels, and Spillway Lake has grown as more of the glacier surface ablates to base level. Subsurface processes play a governing role in creating, maintaining, and shutting down exposures of ice at the glacier surface, with a major impact on spatial patterns and rates of surface mass loss. Comparison of our results with observations on other glaciers indicate that englacial drainage systems play a key role in the response of debris-covered glaciers to sustained periods of negative mass balance.					; Luckman, Adrian/GVS-1716-2022	Benn, Douglas/0000-0002-3604-0886; Nicholson, Lindsey/0000-0003-0430-7950; Thompson, Sarah S/0000-0001-9112-6933; Luckman, Adrian/0000-0002-9618-5905													1994-0416	1994-0424				SEP 22	2017	11	5					2247	2264		10.5194/tc-11-2247-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2247-2017													WOS:000411471000001
J	Xue, LH; Yu, YL; Yang, LZ				Xue, Lihong; Yu, Yingliang; Yang, Linzhang			Maintaining yields and reducing nitrogen loss in rice-wheat rotation system in Taihu Lake region with proper fertilizer management	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In the Tailake region of China, heavy nitrogen (N) loss of rice-wheat rotation systems, due to high fertilizer-N input with low N use efficiency (NUE), was widely reported. To alleviate the detrimental impacts caused by N loss, it is necessary to improve the fertilizer management practices. Therefore, a 3 yr field experiments with different N managements including organic combined chemical N treatment (OCN, 390 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 20% organic fertilizer), control-released urea treatment (CRU, 390 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 70% resin-coated urea), reduced chemical N treatment (RCN, 390 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), all common chemical fertilizer), and site-specific N management (SSNM, 333 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), all common chemical fertilizer) were conducted in the Taihu Lake region with the 'farmer's N' treatment (FN, 510 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), all common chemical fertilizer) as a control. Grain yield, plant N uptake (PNU), NUE, and N losses via runoff, leaching, and ammonia volatilization were assessed. In the rice season, the FN treatment had the highest N loss and lowest NUE, which can be attributed to an excessive rate of N application. Treatments of OCN and RCN with a 22% reduced N rate from FN had no significant effect on PNU nor the yield of rice in the 3 yr; however, the NUE was improved and N loss was reduced 20-32%. OCN treatment achieved the highest yield, while SSNM has the lowest N loss and highest NUE due to the lowest N rate. In wheat season, N loss decreased about 28-48% with the continuous reduction of N input, but the yield also declined, with the exception of OCN treatment. N loss through runoff, leaching and ammonia volatilization was positively correlated with the N input rate. When compared with the pure chemical fertilizer treatment of RCN under the same N input, OCN treatment has better NUE, better yield, and lower N loss. 70% of the urea replaced with resin-coated urea had no significant effect on yield and NUE improvement, but decreased the ammonia volatilization loss. Soil total N and organic matter content showed a decrease after three continuous cropping years with inorganic fertilizer application alone, but there was an increase with the OCN treatment. N balance analysis showed a N surplus for FN treatment and a balanced N budget for OCN treatment. To reduce the environmental impact and maintain a high crop production, proper N reduction together with organic amendments could be sustainable in the rice-wheat rotation system in the Taihu Lake region for a long run.																			1748-9326					NOV	2014	9	11							115010	10.1088/1748-9326/9/11/115010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/9/11/115010													WOS:000346573900041
J	Banwell, A; Hewitt, I; Willis, I; Arnold, N				Banwell, Alison; Hewitt, Ian; Willis, Ian; Arnold, Neil			Moulin density controls drainage development beneath the Greenland ice sheet	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Uncertainty remains about how the surface hydrology of the Greenland ice sheet influences its subglacial drainage system, affecting basal water pressures and ice velocities, particularly over intraseasonal and interseasonal timescales. Here we apply a high spatial (200 m) and temporal (1 h) resolution subglacial hydrological model to a marginal (extending similar to 25 km inland), land-terminating, similar to 200 km(2) domain in the Paakitsoq region, West Greenland. The model is based on that by Hewitt (2013) but adapted for use with both real topographic boundary conditions and calibrated modeled water inputs. The inputs consist of moulin hydrographs, calculated by a surface routing and lake-filling/draining model, which is forced with distributed runoff from a surface energy-balance model. Results suggest that the areal density of lake-bottom moulins and their timing of opening during the melt season strongly affects subglacial drainage system development. A higher moulin density causes an earlier onset of subglacial channelization (i.e., water transport through channels rather than the distributed sheet), which becomes relatively widespread across the bed, whereas a lower moulin density results in a later onset of channelization that becomes less widespread across the bed. In turn, moulin density has a strong control on spatial and temporal variations in subglacial water pressures, which will influence basal sliding rates, and thus ice motion. The density of active surface-to-bed connections should be considered alongside surface melt intensity and extent in future predictions of the ice sheet's dynamics.					; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021	Arnold, Neil/0000-0001-7538-3999; Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC	2016	121	12					2248	2269		10.1002/2015JF003801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JF003801													WOS:000392831800001

The historical data showed that the water temperature did not show extreme/large seasonal variation and it was not correlated either with cyanobacterial growth or microcystin concentration. Among all parameters, the cyanobacteria growth was negatively correlated with humidity and manganese and positively correlated with atmospheric temperature. No significant correlation was found between microcystin concentration and the climatic parameters. Polymer(chitosan)-enhanced microfiltration (PEMF) and ultrafiltration (PEUF) were further tested as an alternative microcystin removal approach from dense cyanobacteria-rich flows. The dominant cyanobacteria in the water intake, Planktothrix rubescens, was isolated and enriched to simulate cyanobacterial blooms in the lake. The PEMF and PEUF were separately applied to enriched P. rubescens culture (PC) (microcystin = 1.236 mu g/L) as well as to the sand filter backwash water (SFBW) of the DWTP where microcystin concentration was higher than 12 mu g/L. The overall microcystin removal rates from the final effluent of PC (always 0.15 mu g/L) were between 90.1-94.7% and 89.5-95.4% using 4 and 20 mg chitosan/L, respectively. Meanwhile, after the PEMF and PEUF of SFBW, the final effluent contained only 0.099 and 0.057 mu g microcystin/L with an overall removal 99%. The presented results are the first from the application of chitosan to remove P. rubescens as well as the implementation of PEMF and PEUF on SFBW to remove cyanobacterial cells and associated toxins.					; Bacchiocchi, Simone/K-6015-2016; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020; Akyol, Çağrı/A-2699-2016; Vignaroli, Carla/K-5745-2016; Accoroni, Stefano/F-5818-2014; Ozbayram, Gozde/AAB-8784-2020; Gorbi, Stefania/K-5662-2016	Radini, Serena/0000-0001-6639-8267; Akyol, Cagri/0000-0002-9907-6616; Accoroni, Stefano/0000-0002-1134-7849; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 1	2021	286								117535	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117535	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117535		JUN 2021						34119863					WOS:000686592000006

Although of diverse origin, the persistence of ARGs in aquatic environments is highly influenced by anthropic activities, allowing potential control actions in well-studied environments. However, knowledge of abundance and space-time distribution of ARGs in ecosystems is still scarce. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we investigated the presence and the abundance of twelve ARGs (against tetracyclines, -lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones and sulphonamides) at different sampling sites, depths and seasons, in Lake Maggiore, a large subalpine lake, and in the area of its watershed. We then evaluated the correlation between each ARG and a number of ecological parameters in the water column in the deepest part of the lake. Our results suggest the constitutive presence of at least four ARGs within the bacterial community with a high proportion of bacteria potentially resistant to tetracyclines and sulphonamides. The presence of these ARGs was independent of the total bacterial density and temperature. The dynamics of tet(A) and sulII genes were, however, positively correlated with dissolved oxygen and negatively to chlorophyll a, suggesting that the resistant microbes inhabit specific niches. These observations indicate that the lake is a reservoir of antibiotic resistances, highlighting the need of a deeper understanding of the sources of ARGs and the factors allowing their persistence in waters.					; CORNO, GIANLUCA/K-1658-2018; Fontaneto, Diego/B-9710-2008; Eckert, Ester/J-5989-2014; CORNO, GIANLUCA/AAB-8889-2019; Di Cesare, Andrea/P-5157-2016	Di Cesare, Andrea/0000-0002-5481-6182; CORNO, GIANLUCA/0000-0002-7423-8797; Fontaneto, Diego/0000-0002-5770-0353; Eckert, Ester/0000-0002-7314-1715; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				AUG	2015	24	15					3888	3900		10.1111/mec.13293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.13293								26118321					WOS:000358335300009

Seasonal storage in small reservoirs is often overlooked in present inventories. Accordingly, we assessed the current state in semi-arid regions using highly resolved Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Globally, about 3 million small reservoirs are in operation in semi-arid regions having a total water surface area of 17 800 km(2) and seasonal storage of 37 km(3), supporting 15% of the world's population in semi-arid regions. Estimated upper-bound of evaporative losses represent 38% (14 km(3)) of storage during dry season. The study estimates the evaporation suppression using floating covers and lays foundation to assess the feasibility of this technical solution to increase water savings. Significance and originality statement This study provides new insights into the distribution of seasonal freshwater storage in water stressed regions that support large rural population. We provide the first baseline dataset of this distributed freshwater resource to better assess the sustainability of communities in semi-arid regions with chronic water shortages. Water storage in semi-arid regions is subject to potential evaporative losses of nearly 40% of the stored water. We analyzed conditions where evaporative losses could be significantly reduced using floating covers, a simple and scalable solution suitable for regions with underdeveloped economies. The study as well ranks regions with highest potential benefits from evaporation suppression measures.

We analyse 172 Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes for the period 1999-2013 to identify thawed supraglacial ponds for the debris-covered tongues of five glaciers in the Langtang Valley of Nepal. We apply an advanced atmospheric correction routine (Landcor/6S) and use band ratio and image morphological techniques to identify ponds and validate our results with 2.5 m Cartosat-1 observations. We then characterize the spatial, seasonal and interannual patterns of ponds. We find high variability in pond incidence between glaciers (May-October means of 0.08-1.69% of debris area), with ponds most frequent in zones of low surface gradient and velocity. The ponds show pronounced seasonality, appearing in the pre-monsoon as snow melts, peaking at the monsoon onset at 2% of debris-covered area, then declining in the post-monsoon as ponds drain or freeze. Ponds are highly recurrent and persistent, with 40.5% of pond locations occurring for multiple years. Rather than a trend in pond cover over the study period, we find high interannual variability for each glacier after controlling for seasonality.					; Steiner, Jakob/IXN-3835-2023; Miles, Evan/J-1286-2019; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021	Steiner, Jakob/0000-0002-0063-0067; Miles, Evan/0000-0001-5446-8571; Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				FEB	2017	63	237					88	105		10.1017/jog.2016.120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2016.120													WOS:000394435300008
J	Yu, L; Liu, XD; Hua, ZL; Zhang, Y; Xue, HQ				Yu, Liang; Liu, Xiaodong; Hua, Zulin; Zhang, Yuan; Xue, Hongqin			Spatial and temporal trends of perfluoroalkyl acids in water bodies: A case study in Taihu Lake, China (2009-2021)*	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have been ubiquitously detected in water bodies and are a cause of great public concern due to their adverse effects. This study investigated the long-term temporal-spatial trends of PFAAs in the water bodies of the entire Taihu Lake, and predicted PFAA concentrations for 2024. A field investigation conducted in 2021 and previous data allowed to derive trends over a broad temporal-spatial scale, which is often not feasible in short-term studies. In the 2009-2021 period, the most quantifiable PFAAs increased, among which perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexanoic acid were predominant. As of 2021, the mean total concentration of ten PFAAs ( n-ary sumation 10PFAA) showed a distinct spatial decreasing trend, moving from north to south within the lake, and similar spatial distribution patterns were also noted in other years. The main PFAA input and most serious contamination were concentrated in the northern region, due to the riverine inputs and clustering of PFAArelated industries. The n-ary sumation 10PFAA concentration in the wet season was greater and presented a more uniform distribution pattern than that in the dry season, possibly due to the combined effects of the degradation of PFAA precursors, water inflow, rainfall, shipping activities, and a shallow water column. From 2009 to 2021 the n-ary sumation 10PFAA concentration of the entire lake showed an increasing trend, but the rate of increase was significantly reduced. In addition, a grey model predicted that the mean n-ary sumation 10PFAA concentration in the entire Taihu Lake will reach 431 ng/L in 2024, and the northern region will be affected by a more serious PFAA pollution in the future because it exhibited a high mean n-ary sumation 10PFAA concentration of 426 ng/L in 2021. These findings provide novel insights into the temporal-spatial distribution of PFAAs in Taihu Lake, and could help regulators to formulate policy decisions in response to PFAA pollution.

SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Alluvial fans are important paleoclimatic archives, thatmay record high-frequency climatic oscillations. However, climate signals may be overprinted or even be destroyed by autogenic processes caused by channel avulsion and lobe switching. Here we present new data from two different Late Pleistocene (MIS 3-2) alluvial fan systems in northern Germany and compare these systems to experimental alluvial fans and other field examples. The selected fan systems formed under similar climatic and tectonic conditions, but differ in size, type, and drainage area allowing to estimate the role of climate and autogenic controls on flow processes, facies architecture, and fan-stacking patterns. Luminescence dating is used to determine the timing of fan onset and aggradation. Fan onset occurred in response to climate change at the end of MIS 3 when temperatures decreased and periglacial climate conditions were established in northern central Europe. A related increase in sediment supply and strongly variable precipitation patterns probably promoted fan formation. The major period of fan aggradationwas approximately between 33 and 18 ka, followed by fan inactivity, abandonment, and incision during the Lateglacial. The highest aggradation rates occurred during the early stage of fan building, when up to 35 m thick sediment accumulated within a few thousand years. Sand-rich, sheetflood-dominated fans are related to larger, low-gradient fan catchments. Steep depositional fan slopes (5 degrees 17 degrees) and short-lived high-energy floods promoted supercritical flowconditions. Well sorted, sediment-laden, rapidly waning flows favored the deposition and preservation of supercritical bedforms and allowed for the aggradation of stable antidunes. Steep, dip-slope catchments enhanced stream gradients and promoted the transport of coarser sediments. These fans have lower gradient slopes (2-6 degrees) and are dominated by channelized flows, alternating with periods of unconfined sheetfloods. Meter-scale coarsening upward successions, characterized by sandy sheetflood deposits at the base, overlain by multilateral or smaller single-story gravelly channel fills may be related to highfrequency climatic fluctuations or seasonal fluctuations in water and sediment supply. These coarsening-upward successions are commonly bounded by a paleo-active layer, from which ice-wedge casts penetrate downwards. The comparison to experimental fans and other field examples implies that the recurrent pattern ofmultistory, multilateral and single-story channel bodieswith a lateral offset to vertical stacking patternmost probablywas controlled by autogenic switch in an avulsion-dominated system. The change in deposition from alluvial-dominated processes to aeolian sedimentation with minor alluvial influences during the Lateglacial records alternation of dry and ephemeral wetter phases that are related to rapid climatic variations. The main phase of aeolian sand-sheet deposition probably correlates with Heinrich event H1 between approximately 18-16 ka and reflects sedimentation in response to aridification and highmeanwind speeds.

Total annual rainfall in the country ranges between 800 mm/y (south-east coat) and 2,000 mm/y (south-west coast) with a bimodal and mono-modal patterns in the south and north, respectively. Annual total runoff from the 3 river systems (the Volta river system, the South-western river system and the Coastal river system) in Ghana is estimated at 40 billion m(3) out of about 53 billion renewable freshwater resources. Groundwater yields ranges from 6 m(3)/h in the Volta basin sedimentary formations to 180 m(3)/h in the limestone formations. It is estimated that the total water withdrawal as a percentage of total renewable water resources is about 2%. At an average per capita consumption of water of 50 l/p/d, estimated daily water demand for the 2021 population of 31 million people stands at about 566 million m(3)/y. Current water supply systems are overstretched and it is further estimated that about US $ 240 million is required per year as capital expenditure in urban and rural water supply. Moreover, climate change is projected to increase the scarcity of water in future. Wastewater generated through domestic and industrial uses including storm water in urban Ghana is estimated at about 760 million m(3)/y. Ghana's irrigation potential to reduce climate change impact on agriculture is put at between 0.36 and 2.9 million ha, accounting for about 66.4% of the consumptive water withdrawal. Estimated water demand for cattle, sheep and goats in 2010 was put at about 22 million m(3)/y. Other services obtained from surface water are the provision of fish (the Volta Lake is estimated to contributes to 16% of total catch in Ghana); hydropower generation accounting for about 40% of total power installed capacity (Akosombo = 1,020 MW, Kpong = 160 MW, and Bui = 404 MW); water transportation (notably on the Volta Lake); tourist attractions [are 550 km Ghana's shoreline that has about 90 lagoons, the Volta Lake, the lower Volta (e.g., Sogakope, Ada) and some other inland waters like Lake Bosumtwi] and wetlands (recognized by RAMSAR convention of 1971) In the legal context, water governance issues are handled by various institutions created by Acts of Parliament.

J	Zeiger, P; Frappart, F; Darrozes, J; Prigent, C; Jiménez, C				Zeiger, Pierre; Frappart, Frederic; Darrozes, Jose; Prigent, Catherine; Jimenez, Carlos			Analysis of CYGNSS coherent reflectivity over land for the characterization of pan-tropical inundation dynamics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The monitoring of flood and wetland dynamics at global scale is hampered by several limitations, including a reduced data availability in tropical areas due to the presence of clouds affecting visible and infrared imagery, or low spatial and/or temporal resolutions affecting passive and active microwave Earth Observation (EO) data. As a consequence, surface water extent estimates and their temporal variations remain challenging especially in equatorial river basins. Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) L-band signals recorded onboard Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission, composed of 8 Low Elevation Orbit (LEO) satellites, provide infor-mation on surface properties at high temporal resolution from 2017 up to now. CYGNSS bistatic observations were analyzed for detecting permanent water and seasonal floodplains over the full coverage of the mission, from 40 degrees S to 40 degrees N. We computed CYGNSS reflectivity associated to the coherent component of the received power, that was gridded at 0.1 degrees spatial resolution with a 7-day time sampling afterwards. Several statistical metrics were derived from CYGNSS reflectivity, including the weighted mean and standard deviation, the median and the 90th percentile (respectively rmean, rstd, rmedian and r90%) in each pixel. These parameters were clustered using the K -means algorithm with an implementation of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure. They were compared to static inundation maps, and to dynamic estimations of surface water extent both at the global and regional scales, using the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and MODIS-based products. The difference between r90% and rmedian shows the best sensitivity to the presence of water. The river streams and lakes are correctly detected, and a strong seasonality is identified in CYGNSS reflectivity over the largest floodplains, with the exception of the Cuvette Centrale of Congo which is covered by dense vegetation. This seasonal reflectivity signal correlates well with inundation maps: Pearson's correlation coefficient between rmedian and surface water extent from both GIEMS and MODIS is over 0.8 in the largest floodplains. The spatial patterns of reflectivity are consistent with static inundation maps: at the time of maximum flooding extent, a spatial correlation coefficient around 0.75 with rmedian is obtained for several basins. We also evaluated the dependence of CYGNSS-derived clusters and reflectivity on the dominant land cover type and on the density of Above Groud Biomass (AGB) in the pixel. On the one hand, misclassifications of flooded pixels were observed over vegetated regions, probably due to uncertainties related to the attenuation by the vegetation in both CYGNSS and reference datasets. On the other hand, flooded pixels with a mean AGB up to similar to 300 Mg/ha were correctly detected with the clustering. High reflectivity values are also observed over rocky soils in arid regions and create false alarms. Finally, strong winds on large lakes cause surface roughness, and lower reflectivity values are observed in this case which weaken the detection of open water. While these constraints are to be taken in account and corrected in a future model, a pan-tropical mapping of surface water extent dynamics using CYGNSS can be envisaged.

J	Nourani, V; Tootoonchi, R; Andaryani, S				Nourani, Vahid; Tootoonchi, Roshanak; Andaryani, Soghra			Investigation of climate, land cover and lake level pattern changes and interactions using remotely sensed data and wavelet analysis	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Lake Urmia -a hypersaline lake in northwest of Iran-has lost perceptible amount of its waterbody since mid '90s. Reasons behind this catastrophe could be categorized as climatic factors and anthropogenic activities. To investigate pattern changes and interactions of the components involved in this dramatic water loss, precipita-tion (P), discharge (Q), temperature (T), sea surface temperature (SST) alongside satellite images of vegetation cover (VC) from 1990 to 2019 were used for pattern and interaction analysis, including trend and seasonality detection. Owing to the fact that this endorheic lake in extremis is located between East Azerbaijan (EA) and West Azerbaijan (WA) provinces, additionally it was aimed to juxtapose changes in the aforementioned variables assembled from these two provinces. To monitor changes in VC, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series for two pilot sub-watersheds from EA and WA provinces were calculated using remotely sensed images. Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test revealed that amongst all variables, Q in both sub-watersheds has been intensely decreased in 99% confidence level. Moreover, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of Q exhibited drastic de-escalations in terms of annual and semi-annual periodicities. VC and urbanization in both sub-watersheds showed significant increasing trends, whereas VC in WA province showed a higher level of trend. Fairly stable P in terms of trend and periodicity alongside intensification in VC concluded intense exploitations of Q which is the other main inflow into this lake. Wavelet coherence transformation (WTC) between all considered variables and Lake Urmia's WL revealed the great impacts of Q, T and SST variables on the lake's WL fluctuations and seasonality. The impact of T and SST on WL fluctuations did not illustrate perceptible changes throughout the study period (i.e., before and after lake's desiccation). The impact of Q on the lake's WL, however, has moved to larger frequency bands with increased phase-lags, and thus, it could be concluded that the intense reduction of the lake's WL is in proportion to intense reduction of rivers discharge to this lake; leaving transparent traces of anthropogenic impacts on Lake Urmia's tragedy.

Through a four-year investigation in Miyun Reservoir, a huge mesotrophic drinking water reservoir known to have the MIS episodes, we found that the Planktothrix sp. bloomed during September and October causing the high levels of MIS in the reservoir. The concentration of MIS and the biomass of MIB-producing cyanobacteria Planktothrix were measured (n = 887) at different sites and depths during different seasons. The results indicated that the shallow region of the reservoir is the major habitat for Planktothrix sp. due to that the light is able to penetrate down to the relatively high concentrations of nutrients close to the sediments. Quantile regression analysis between Planktothrix biomass and MIS concentration shows that the risk of MIS exceeding the odor threshold (15 ng L-1) in water was as high as 90% when the Planktothrix density was more than 4.0 x 10(5) cells L-1, while the risk was reduced to 10% when the Planktothrix density remained below 1.6 x 10(4) cells L-1. This study will improve the understanding of the environmental behaviors of Planktothrix sp., and can provide useful information for better management of drinking water lakes/reservoirs experiencing the taste and odor (T&O) problems caused by deep living cyanobacterial species.

However, the link between the transport and transformation of soil P and the dynamics of P availability in reservoir regions are not well demonstrated. The present study selected the Pengxi River suffering the anti-seasonal water level fluctuation of the Three Gorgers Reservoir as the study area. Soil nutrients along the longitudinal and lateral gradients of the Pengxi River were investigated to illustrate the spatial distribution patterns, analyzed by the Hedley extraction schemes. The effects of biotic and abiotic factors on soil P transformation and the dynamics of bioavailable P were evaluated via determinations of enzymatic hydrolysis phosphorus (EHP) with and without ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The results indicated that soil nutrients varied significantly between the water level fluctuation zone (WLFZ) and upland along the river longitudinal gradients, where the trends of the extracted OP were the same in H2O, NaHCO3 and NaOH extractions. The EHP accounted for 33.67 +/- 15.87% of the total extracted OP, of which Monoester P, Phytate-like P and NHOP were determined at all extracts but Diester P was mainly found at H2O and NaOH extracts. UV irradiation significantly increased P bioavailability up to 24.44%. These results could demonstrate the mechanism of soil P transformation via UV irradiation and enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, the bioavailable P enters the water body during the submergence period may lead to eutrophication in the Pengxi River, which could pose a risk to the reservoir ecosystem.

Here, we focused on the suspended particulate matter (SPM)-bound PAHs in Lake Chaohu, China to quantitatively estimate their spatiotemporal toxicities from different sources. A source-based quantitative method, positive matrix factorization (PMF)-benzo[a]pyrene-based toxic equivalency (TEQ(BaP)) model, was applied. Firstly, we investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of SPM-bound PAHs. The concentrations of Sigma(21) PAHs ranged from 1646 to 19267 ng.g(-1). Low-ring PAHs were found to have the highest fractions. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)-partitioning around medoid (PAM) technic revealed significantly spatiotemporal variation characteristics of SPM-bound PAHs in Lake Chaohu. Season, location (west or east lake zone), and sample classification (estuary or lake) together governed the patterns. Then, their potential sources were apportioned. Our results found that diagnostic ratios did not work perfectly. However, 3 factors were separated by PMF model. Unburned petroleum (F1), biomass, coal and gasoline combustion (F2), and diesel, straw combustion (F3) were the main sources of PAHs, accounting for 36.16%, 48.96% and 14.88%, respectively. The patterns of the source profiles were season-dependent. Finally, the toxicity of SPM-bound PAHs from different sources were predicted by PMF-TEQ(BaP) model, and the model predictions were satisfactorily acceptable. Overall, predicted Sigma(19) TEQ(BaP) of SPM-bound PAHs in Lake Chaohu ranged from 20.8 to 947.9 ng.g(-1). Benzo[e]pyrene (BeP), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) were the main toxic species. Temporally, PAH toxicity posed significantly seasonal differences. F3 had primary contributions to Sigma(19) TEQ(BaP). Cutting the diesel consumption and using cleaner energy substitutes were suggested to reduce the PAH toxicity in Lake Chaohu. Overall, we expected this study could give new insights into the spatiotemporal associations between the sources and toxicities of SPM-bound PAHs in lake ecosystem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Su, Y; Ran, YH; Zhang, GQ; Li, X				Su, Yang; Ran, Youhua; Zhang, Guoqing; Li, Xin			Remotely sensed lake area changes in permafrost regions of the Arctic and the Tibetan Plateau between 1987 and 2017	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Both gradual and abrupt changes in lake surface area in permafrost regions are crucial for understanding the water cycles in cold regions under climate change. However, seasonal changes in lake area in permafrost regions are not available, and their occurrence conditions are still unclear. Based on remotely sensed water body products at a 30 m resolution, this study provides a detailed comparison of lake area changes across seven basins characterized by clear gradients in climatic, topographic and permafrost conditions in the Arctic and Tibetan Plateau between 1987 and 2017. The results show that the maximum surface area of all lakes net increased by 13.45%. Among them, the seasonal lake area net increased by 28.66 %, but there was also a 2.48 % loss. The permanent lake area net increased by 6.39 %, and the area loss was approximately 3.22 %. The total permanent lake area generally decreased in the Arctic but increased in the Tibetan Plateau. At lake region scale (0.1 degrees grid), the changes in permanent area of contained lakes were divided into four types including no change, homogeneous changes (only expansion or only shrinkage), hetero-geneous changes (expansion neighboring shrinkage) and abrupt changes (newforming or vanishing). The lake regions with heterogeneous changes accounted for over one-quarter of all lake regions. All types of changes in lake regions, especially the heterogeneous changes and abrupt changes (e.g., vanishing), occurred more extensively and intensely on low and flat terrain, in high-density lake regions and in warm permafrost regions. These findings indicate that, con-sidering the increase in surface water balance in these river basins, surface water balance alone cannot fully explain changes in permanent lake area in the permafrost region, and the thawing or disappearance of permafrost plays a tipping point effect on the lake changes.

The focus has been on commercially important fish species and their food consumption, while diet and interactions of other fishes have been studied only sporadically. In 2015, a large-scale stomach sampling program was carried out for fish species caught on routine monitoring surveys in the Barents Sea during different seasons of the year, supplemented with samples collected from Russian commercial fisheries. A total of 27,657 stomachs from 70 fish species (including two genera) were analysed, providing a baseline on fish diet in the Barents Sea which can serve as a reference for future studies related to climate change. We summarize methodological aspects and diet composition for the studied species. Cluster analysis grouped the fishes in nine trophic groups based on similarities in diet among fish species, while principal component analyses revealed the position of the species and trophic groups along axes reflecting degrees of piscivory, planktivory, and benthivory. The three most distinctly separated groups were piscivores, a group of benthivores feeding on polychaetes, and planktivores feeding on small crustaceans. The latter could be further split into two groups: fishes of Atlantic origin feeding on copepods and euphausiids, and fishes of Arctic origin feeding on hyperiid amphipods. Warming in the Barents Sea were associated with redistribution of water masses, species and increasing biomass of krill and jellyfish. A boreal Meganyctiphanes norvegica, not observed in the northern Barents Sea before, were found in diet of three Arctic fishes (2% of stomachs only). Gelatinous plankton, mainly Ctenophora, were observed in the diet of 1430 individuals from 15 fish species, including two species which have not been reported to eat gelatinous plankton in the Barents Sea before. This work updates our knowledge about trophic structure and interactions in the Barents Sea, providing a baseline for further investigations.					; Dolgov, Andrey/D-3708-2012; Prokopchuk, Irina/ABB-3955-2021; Prokhorova, Tatiana/AAZ-7154-2021; Strand, Espen/A-4435-2013; Alexandr, Benzik/ABE-5827-2021	Benzik, Alexandr/0000-0002-9807-4379; Vihtakari, Mikko/0000-0003-0371-4319; Keulder, Felicia/0000-0002-3076-1236; 													0079-6611					APR	2020	183								102262	10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102262													WOS:000528805100014

Artificial selection on reproductive timing in hatchery salmon drives a phenological shift and potential maladaptation to climate change	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												The timing of breeding migration and reproduction links generations and substantially influences individual fitness. In salmonid fishes, such phenological events (seasonal return to freshwater and spawning) vary among populations but are consistent among years, indicating local adaptation in these traits to prevailing environmental conditions. Changing reproductive phenology has been observed in many populations of Atlantic and Pacific salmon and is sometimes attributed to adaptive responses to climate change. The sockeye salmon spawning in the Cedar River near Seattle, Washington, USA, have displayed dramatic changes in spawning timing over the past 50 years, trending later through the early 1990s, and becoming earlier since then. We explored the patterns and drivers of these changes using generalized linear models and mathematical simulations to identify possible environmental correlates of the changes, and test the alternative hypothesis that hatchery propagation caused inadvertent selection on timing. The trend toward later spawning prior to 1993 was partially explained by environmental changes, but the rapid advance in spawning since was not. Instead, since its initiation in 1991, the hatchery has, on average, selected for earlier spawning, and, depending on trait heritability, could have advanced spawning by 1-3 weeks over this period. We estimated heritability of spawning date to be high (h(2) ~0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.1), so the upper end of this range is not improbable, though at lower heritabilities a smaller effect would be expected. The lower reproductive success of early spawners and relatively low survival of early emerging juveniles observed in recent years suggest that artificial and natural selection are acting in opposite directions. The fitness costs of early spawning may be exacerbated by future warming; thus, the artificially advanced phenology could reduce the population's productivity. Such artificial selection is known in many salmon hatcheries, so there are broad consequences for the productivity of wild populations comingled with hatchery-produced fish.																			1752-4571					AUG	2019	12	7			SI		1344	1359		10.1111/eva.12730	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.12730								31417619					WOS:000480580300009

Assessing Climate Change Impacts on River Flows in the Tonle Sap Lake Basin, Cambodia	WATER												The Tonle Sap is the most fertile and diverse freshwater ecosystem in Southeast Asia, receiving nurturing water flows from the Mekong and its immediate basin. In addition to rapid development in the Tonle Sap basin, climate change may threaten natural flow patterns that sustain its diversity. The impacts of climate change on river flows in 11 sub-basins contributing to the Tonle Sap Lake were assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to quantify the potential magnitude of future hydrological alterations. Projected river flows from three General Circulation Models (GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC and IPSL-CM5A-MR) for three time horizons (2030s, 2060s and 2090s) indicate a likely decrease in both the wet and dry season flows. The mean annual projected flow reductions range from 9 to 29%, 10 to 35% and 7 to 41% for the 2030s, 2060s and 2090s projections, respectively. Moreover, a decrease in extreme river flows (Q(5) and Q(95)) was also found, which implies there could be a decline in flood magnitudes and an increase in drought occurrences throughout the basin. The results of this study provide insight for water resources planning and adaptation strategies for the river ecosystems during the dry season, when water flows are projected to decrease.

Understanding the significance of these factors is crucial for mitigating phytoplankton blooms. An extensive study was conducted to explore this relationship including an examination of 108 phytoplankton communities in the mainstream and eight tributaries of the Dongjiang River during both rainy and dry seasons. The results demonstrated the profound impact of both major nutrients and DOM on phytoplankton communities (p < 0.05). Under high-flow velocity conditions, major nutrients dominated, explaining 20 % and 2.5 % of variance during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. DOM had a smaller influence, contributing -2.4 % and 1.1 % during these seasons. Conversely, under low-flow velocity conditions, major nutrients explained less than 8.0 % of the variation, while DOM became prominent, explaining over 11.8 % of the phytoplankton community dynamics. The dominant genera exhibited pronounced blooms in response to increased major nutrient levels across all hydrological conditions. Specific DOM components (C2, C3, and C4) were positively correlated with phytoplankton in the low flow streams (p < 0.05). These findings indicate the dual influence of major nutrients and DOM on phytoplankton communities, with their relative significance contingent upon spatial variations in hydrological conditions. As the flow velocity decreased and the potential nutrient retention time increased, the importance of DOM surpassed that of the major nutrients. These insights have substantial implications for managing stream ecosystems and preventing phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic river systems.

The under-ice microbiome of seasonally frozen lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Compared to the well-studied open water of the "growing" season, under-ice conditions in lakes are characterized by low and rather constant temperature, slow water movements, limited light availability, and reduced exchange with the surrounding landscape. These conditions interact with ice-cover duration to shape microbial processes in temperate lakes and ultimately influence the phenology of community and ecosystem processes. We review the current knowledge on microorganisms in seasonally frozen lakes. Specifically, we highlight how under-ice conditions alter lake physics and the ways that this can affect the distribution and metabolism of auto-and heterotrophic microorganisms. We identify functional traits that we hypothesize are important for understanding under-ice dynamics and discuss how these traits influence species interactions. As ice coverage duration has already been seen to reduce as air temperatures have warmed, the dynamics of the under-ice microbiome are important for understanding and predicting the dynamics and functioning of seasonally frozen lakes in the near future.					; Jones, Ian/E-5507-2015; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Burgin, Amy/ABI-2572-2020; Lennon, Jay/ABE-6120-2020; Shade, Ashley/JOZ-2968-2023; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Burgin, Amy/G-7444-2014	Shade, Ashley/0000-0002-7189-3067; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; Lennon, Jay T./0000-0003-3126-6111; Burgin, Amy/0000-0001-8489-4002													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2013	58	6					1998	2012		10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.1998	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.1998													WOS:000327395400008

WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The development and availability of climate forecasting systems have allowed the implementation of seasonal hydroclimatic services at the continental scale. User guidance and quality of the forecast information are key components to ensure user engagement and service uptake, yet forecast quality depends on the hydrologic model setup. Here, we address how seasonal forecasts from continental services can be used to address user needs at the catchment scale. We compare a continentally calibrated process-based model (E-HYPE) and a catchment-specific parsimonious model (GR6J) to forecast streamflow in a set of French catchments. Results show that despite expected high performance from the catchment setup against observed streamflow, the continental setup can, in some catchments, match or even outperform the catchment-specific setup for 3-month aggregations and threshold exceedance. Forecast systems can become comparable when looking at statistics relative to model climatology, such as anomalies, and adequate initial conditions are the main source of skill in both systems. We highlight the need for consistency in data used in modeling chains and in tailoring service outputs for use at the catchment scale. Finally, we show that the spread in internal model states varies largely between the two systems, reflecting the differences in their setups and calibration strategies, and highlighting that caution is needed before extracting hydrologic variables other than streamflow. We overall argue that continental hydroclimatic services show potential on addressing needs at the catchment scale, yet guidance is needed to extract, tailor and use the information provided. Plain Language Summary Climatic variations can have a significant impact on a number of water-related sectors. Managing such variations through accurate predictions is thus crucial. Continental hydroclimate services have recently received attention to address various user needs. However, predictions for months ahead can be limited at catchment scale, highlighting the need for data tailoring. Here, we compare the predictions from two hydrologic setups at catchment scale. One setup (E-HYPE) is used in a European hydroclimate service, whereas the other (GR6J) is used for local water-related risk assessment. Our results show that predictions from the continental setup can be as accurate as the predictions from the local model when predicting streamflow averaged over several months and when looking at changes in streamflow rather than absolute values. A good estimation of the hydrologic states, such as soil moisture or lake levels, prior to the prediction is the most important factor in obtaining accurate streamflow predictions in both setups. However, the differences in the setups can result in different uncertainties for variables other than streamflow, like in the case of soil water content. We argue that useful information is provided by continental services, yet guidance for information extraction can result into tailored information for regional needs.					; Pechlivanidis, Ilias/AAC-6979-2019	Crochemore, Louise/0000-0001-5776-6275; Ramos, Maria-Helena/0000-0003-1133-4164; Pechlivanidis, Ilias/0000-0002-3416-317X													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2020	56	2							e2019WR025700	10.1029/2019WR025700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025700													WOS:000535672800020

This has the potential to convert Amazon forests from net carbon sinks to net carbon sources. Although modern human influence over the Earth is substantial, debate remains over when humans began to dominate Earth's natural systems. To date, little is known about the history of human land use in key regions like the Amazon. Here, we examine the history of human occupation from a similar to 8,500 year-old sediment core record from Lake Carana (LC) in the eastern Amazon. The onset of pre-Columbian activity at LC (similar to 4,500 cal yr B.P) is associated with the beginning of fire management and crop cultivation, later followed by the formation of Amazonian Dark Earth soils (ADEs) similar to 2,000 cal yr B.P. Selective forest enrichment of edible plants and low-severity fire activity altered the composition and structure of forests growing on ADEs (ADE forests) making them more drought susceptible and fire-prone. Following European colonization (1661 A.D.), the Amazon rubber boom (mid-1800s to 1920 A.D.) is associated with record-low fire activity despite drier regional climate, indicating fire exclusion. The formation of FLONA Reserve in 1974 A.D. is accompanied by the relocation of traditional populations and a fire suppression policy. Despite suppression efforts, biomass burning and fire severity in the past decade is higher than any other period in the record. This is attributed to combined climate and human factors which create optimal conditions for mega-fires in ADE forests and threatens to transform the Amazon from a net carbon sink to a net carbon source. To help mitigate the occurrence of mega-fires, a fire management policy reducing fire-use and careful fire management for farming may help to reduce fuel loads and the occurrence of mega-fires in fire-prone ADE forests. As both natural and anthropogenic pressures are projected to increase in the Amazon, this study provides valuable insights into the legacy of past human land use on modern ADE forest composition, structure, and flammability that can inform ecological benchmarks and future management efforts in the eastern Amazon.

However, monthly and seasonal variations in lake water levels are difficult to monitor due to the lack of sufficient in situ gauges across moun-tainous areas. Moreover, GEDI products exhibit large uncertainties in mountainous surroundings. In this paper, taking Qinghai Lake as an example, we first refined the raw data of the GEDI and ICESat-2 missions by imple-menting a quality control procedure involving outlier removal tailored to the characteristics of each mission; then, we analyzed the accuracy of each mission, especially targeting factors that affect the water level retrievals in the GEDI products. Third, the bias between the two missions was adjusted by selecting the overlapping or adjacent observation dates. Finally, we constructed dense temporal water-level data by integrating the refined ICESat-2 and GEDI data. Data from water level stations and the DAHITI and Hydroweb datasets were also utilized for validation. The results show that (1) very accurate results can be obtained from the ICESat-2 ATL13 product, and the standard deviations of most observed days are under 0.05 m; (2) the GEDI products derived from al-gorithm 2 can offer more effective footprints than those from algorithm 1, with an improvement of approxi-mately 9.78 %. Moreover, large differences exist among the different GEDI beams, and beams 1 and 2 are recommended for further analysis. Overall, most beams overestimated the lake levels with a bias of 0.264 +/- 0.357 m; (3) the long-time-series water levels showed a mean increasing trend of 0.243 m/yr from 2018 to 2021. The relatively high-water-level periods were distributed mostly in August and September, while the low-water-level periods were distributed mostly in February and March. The combined water levels were very correlated with the DAHITI and Hydroweb datasets, with R values larger than 0.8, and highly consistent with the obser-vations from hydrological stations (the inter-year change range spanned from 0.015 m to 0.327 m, and the intra-year difference range varied from 0.03 m to 0.16 m); and (4) Integrating the GEDI and ICESat-2 missions allowed us to capture the monthly, seasonal and annual dynamics of the lake water level, and the results indicate that the combined dataset presents a valuable resource for hydrological and climatic change studies.

In this context, estimating the Local Contribution to Beta Diversity (LCBD) and the individual Species Contribution to Beta diversity (SCBD) have been shown to be a good approach to improve knowledge of the drivers of beta diversity. We examined the beta diversity of macrophytes surveyed at 49 floodplain lakes in the Pantanal Wetlands in Brazil during the dry season. We found that, unexpectedly, total species richness was not correlated to LCBD values, but the number of rare species per site was possibly related to LCBD values. Three variables from Moran's Eigenvector Maps (MEM), water transparency and organic matter were the main variables related to LCBD values. The species with highest contributions to beta diversity were those that occurred at approximately half of the surveyed sites. The same patterns were observed when analysing macrophyte data divided by life forms. Of the life forms, floating macrophytes contributed most to beta diversity. The understanding of which factors drive variation in LCBD and which kind of species most contribute to SCBD are fundamental to performing efficient conservation and restoration programs to maintain the structural, functional and ecological diversity of the macrophyte communities in dynamic floodplain ecosystems.					; Landeiro, Victor/H-2195-2012; Heino, Jani/E-6342-2010	Landeiro, Victor Lemes/0000-0002-9341-6050; Heino, Jani/0000-0003-1235-6613; Pozzobom Costa, Ully Mattilde/0000-0002-8724-3464; Brito, Maiara Tabatha da Silva/0000-0002-1490-8488													1015-1621	1420-9055				MAY 14	2020	82	3							56	10.1007/s00027-020-00730-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-00730-2													WOS:000533029400001
J	Harris, SA				Harris, Stuart A.			Climatic change in Western North America during the last 15,000 years: The role of changes in the relative strengths of air masses in producing the changing climates	SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS												In the Cordillera of western North America, the influence of the Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation only affects coastal areas west of the Coast Range and the lowlands of western and southern Alaska. The rest of the area is subject to a climate controlled by the relative strengths of three distinct air masses, viz., the cold cA/cP air that is dominant in winter, the mP air bringing cool moist air over the mountains throughout the year, and the dry hot cT air from the deserts of the southwestern United States. The Arctic Front marks the boundary between the cA/cP air mass and the other two. Changes in the relative strengths of these air masses appear to explain the climatic changes documented throughout the region. Thus, in the last 30 years, the average position of the Arctic Front has moved north from about 53 degrees N to 58 degrees N, causing the warming in northern British Columbia and cooling south of Calgary, Alberta. This concept of changing positions of the air masses also appears to explain the mechanism behind the past climatic changes in this region. During the last Neoglacial event (c.1400-1900 A.D.), it appears that the cA/cP air mass had strengthened enough to push the Arctic Front south of the 49th parallel. Incursions of mP air increased with localized areas of short-term heavy snowfalls resulting in small-scale advances of glaciers in these regions. This accounts for the variability in timing and extent of these glacial advances, while the resulting increased Chinook activity produced the development of a sand sea between Medicine Hat and Regina on the southern Prairies. The cT air mass was relatively weak, permitting these changes. During the maximum of the Altithermal/Hysithermal warm event (6,000 years B.P.), the Arctic Front had retreated into the southern Yukon Territory as the cT air mass became stronger. The mP air could not move inland as easily, resulting in drier climates across the region. Prairie plants migrated into the southern Yukon Territory, and land snails from the eastern United States were able to migrate up the Saskatchewan River system as far as Lake Louise, Alberta. On the southern Prairies, the many small sloughs and lakes dried up. During the maximum of the Late Wisconsin Glacial event (15,000 years B.P.), the Arctic Front had moved south to the vicinity of 30 degrees N, while there had been a southward movement of the Zone of Intertropical Convergence from the equator to about 10 degrees S. The mP air was also very strong and dumped enormous quantities of snow in the glaciated Canadian Cordillera, but it does not appear to have moved south any distance into the northern United States, witness the limited glaciation and widespread permafrost that developed there. Instead, there is evidence for buffering of the climatic changes in the closed basins in the northern Cordillera of the contiguous United States. The source of the cT air mass had moved south into the northern part of South America, permitting an exchange of savannah biota between the two continents. An extensive area of white dune sands inundated both savannah and forest along the inland hills in Guyana. This parallels the massive changes in African climatology during the last Ice Age (Fairbridge, 1964). If these changes occurred each time there was a major glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere, this would explain the movement of biota from all terrestrial environments between the two American continents in the last 2 million years. A similar northward movement of climatic belts occurred in South America, with the cA air from Antarctica expanding northwards into southern Argentina and Chili. However paucity of data and the potential effects of El Nino and the Southern Oscillation make it difficult to provide details of the changes there in the present state of knowledge. This technique of studying the mechanisms of present-day climatic changes and applying the results to past climatic events has considerable potential for elucidating past climatic changes elsewhere in continental regions. This may prove particularly valuable in studying the Siberian anticyclone that is the main cause of the distribution of permafrost, but this will need international cooperation to be successful.

J	Zheng, YS; Heng, P; Conte, MH; Vachula, RS; Huang, YS				Zheng, Yinsui; Heng, Patrick; Conte, Maureen H.; Vachula, Richard S.; Huang, Yongsong			Systematic chemotaxonomic profiling and novel paleotemperature indices based on alkenones and alkenoates: Potential for disentangling mixed species input	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The unsaturation indices (U-37(K), U-37(K')) of long chain alkenones are powerful paleotemperature proxies and have been widely applied for sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions in the past three decades. However, these indices encounter major difficulties in systems harboring different alkenone-producing haptophyte species, such as saline lakes and marginal ocean environments. All haptophytes produce C-37 alkenones, but different species often display large differences in temperature calibrations and may bloom in different seasons, hindering the use of U(37)(K)and U-37(K') indices for reliable paleotemperature reconstructions in mixed systems. To overcome these problems, we have recently reported a new analytical method that allows comprehensive separation of up to 32 alkenones, alkenoates and their double bond positional isomers in culture and sediment samples. Here we report a systematic analysis of alkenones and alkenoates from six haptophyte cultures growing at a wide range of temperatures (4-25 degrees C). Together with a compilation of 230 previously published culture data sets, we present here systematic calibrations of temperature-sensitive indices based on all alkenone and alkenoate homologues (including isomers). Using this dataset, we extract systematic chemotaxonomic criteria for differentiating individual haptophyte species and demonstrate such chemotaxonomic features can be encoded into a machine learning model for reliable species identifications. Specifically, we show that temperature calibrations based on C-38 methyl ketones and C-39 ethyl ketones are potentially useful for disentangling mixed inputs in estuarine systems where Group III (E. huxleyi) and Group II alkenones mix, and that C-36 ethyl alkenoate isomeric ratios display minimal species heterogeneity and are potentially more suited for reconstructing temperatures in mixed systems with different Group II haptophytes. Using the culture data as base profiles, we construct a mathematical model for estimating percentage inputs from alkenones of different Isochrysidales groups in mixed systems, with potential implications for inferring past salinity changes. Overall, the results from this study demonstrate important new applications of alkenone and alkenoate biomarkers in paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the occurrence of antibiotics in inland lakes. In this study, a total of 83 target antibiotics were quantified in water and sediment samples collected from the Qinghai Lake, the largest inland lake of China located on the northeast of Qinghai-Tibet plateau, and its inflowing rivers. The results showed that 27 and 25 antibiotics were detected in water and sediments, respectively, with the summed concentrations (SUM) of 1.14-17.3 ng/L and 0.72-8.31 ng/g. Compared with the input rivers, significantly higher levels of sulfonamides (SAs), quinolones (QNs), polyethers (PEs), and SUM in water samples were observed in Qinghai Lake water. The average proportions of SAs (50.9-52.7%) and QNs (22.0-28.3%) in Qinghai Lake water nearly doubled compared to those in input rivers. An enrichment factor (EF) was proposed to reveal the enrichment degree of antibiotics in Qinghai Lake compared to its input river water. Sulfaguanidine (SGD), flumequine (FLU), and nalidixic acid (NDA) were enriched in Qinghai Lake up to several ten times based on the calculated EF values, due to their persistence in such a cold saline lake. Risk assessment showed that most antibiotics except anhydrochlortetracycline (ACTC) had insignificant risks to aquatic organisms and antibiotic resistance selection in Qinghai Lake water. This study was the first to reveal the enrichment of antibiotics in Qinghai Lake water, and suggests the urgent need to investigate the possible long-term enrichment and environmental risks of antibiotics in inland lakes.

Andreza; Bleninger, Tobias; Mannich, Michael; Lorke, Andreas			Effects of dimensionality on the performance of hydrodynamic models for stratified lakes and reservoirs	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Numerical models are an important tool for simulating temperature, hydrodynamics, and water quality in lakes and reservoirs. Existing models differ in dimensionality by considering spatial variations of simulated parameters (e.g., flow velocity and water temperature) in one (1D), two (2D) or three (3D) spatial dimensions. The different approaches are based on different levels of simplification in the description of hydrodynamic processes and result in different demands on computational power. The aim of this study is to compare three models with different dimensionalities and to analyze differences between model results in relation to model simplifications. We analyze simulations of thermal stratification, flow velocity and substance transport by density currents in a medium-sized drinking-water reservoir in the subtropical zone, using three widely used open-source models: GLM (1D), CE-QUAL-W2 (2D) and Delft3D (3D). The models were operated with identical initial and boundary conditions over a 1-year period. Their performance was assessed by comparing model results with measurements of temperature, flow velocity and turbulence. Our results show that all models were capable of simulating the seasonal changes in water temperature and stratification. Flow velocities, only available for the 2D and 3D approaches, were more challenging to reproduce, but 3D simulations showed closer agreement with observations. With increasing dimensionality, the quality of the simulations also increased in terms of error, correlation and variance. None of the models provided good agreement with observations in terms of mixed layer depth, which also affects the spreading of inflowing water as density currents and the results of water quality models that build on outputs of the hydrodynamic models.

Variation in estimates of heat-related mortality reduction due to tree cover in US cities	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Heat-related mortality is one of the leading causes of weather-related deaths in the United States. With changing climates and an aging population, effective adaptive strategies to address public health and environmental justice issues associated with extreme heat will be increasingly important. One effective adaptive strategy for reducing heat-related mortality is increasing tree cover. Designing such a strategy requires decision-support tools that provide spatial and temporal information about impacts. We apply such a tool to estimate spatially and temporally explicit reductions in temperature and mortality associated with a 10% increase in tree cover in 10 U. S. cities with varying climatic, demographic, and land cover conditions. Two heat metrics were applied to represent tree impacts on moderately and extremely hot days (relative to historical conditions). Increasing tree cover by 10% reduced estimated heat-related mortality in cities significantly, with total impacts generally greatest in the most populated cities. Mortality reductions vary widely across cities, ranging from approximately 50 fewer deaths in Salt Lake City to about 3800 fewer deaths in New York City. This variation is due to differences in demographics, land cover, and local climatic conditions. In terms of per capita estimated impacts, hotter and drier cities experience higher percentage reductions in mortality due to increased tree cover across the season. Phoenix potentially benefits the most from increased tree cover, with an estimated 22% reduction in mortality from baseline levels. In cooler cities such as Minneapolis, trees can reduce mortality significantly on days that are extremely hot relative to historical conditions and therefore help mitigate impacts during heat wave conditions. Recent studies project highest increases in heat-related mortality in the cooler cities, so our findings have important implications for adaptation planning. Our estimated spatial and temporal distributions of mortality reductions for each city provide crucial information needed for promoting environmental justice and equity. More broadly, the methods and model can be applied by both urban planners and the public health community for designing targeted, effective policies to reduce heat-related mortality. Additionally, land use managers can use this information to optimize tree plantings. Public stakeholders can also use these impact estimates for advocacy.					; Hirabayashi, Satoshi/AAC-3078-2019; Endreny, Theodore/H-4743-2019	sinha, paramita/0000-0001-5667-9428; Coville, Robert/0000-0002-6895-2564; Hirabayashi, Satoshi/0000-0003-4259-2748; Lim, Brian/0000-0003-1664-1462; Endreny, Theodore/0000-0002-1891-261X; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 1	2022	301								113751	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113751		OCT 2021						34628283					WOS:000711214300002
J	Dronova, I; Gong, P; Wang, L; Zhong, LH				Dronova, Iryna; Gong, Peng; Wang, Lin; Zhong, Liheng			Mapping dynamic cover types in a large seasonally flooded wetland using extended principal component analysis and object-based classification	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Periodically inundated wetlands with high short-term surface variation require special approaches to assess their composition and long-term change. To circumvent high uncertainty in single-date analyses of such areas, we propose to characterize them as dynamic cover types (DCTs), or sequences of wetland states and transitions informed by physically and ecologically plausible surface processes. This study delineated DCTs for one 2007-2008 flood cycle at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater wetland in China, using spatial and temporal orientation modes of extended principal components analysis (EPCA) and supervised object-based classification of multi-spectral and radar image series. Classification accuracy was compared among three sets of attributes selected by machine-learning optimization from object-level mean and standard deviations of: 1) image time series alone; 2) the most informative EPCA outputs alone and 3) image time series and EPCA results together. Classification uncertainty was additionally assessed as low values of object's maximum class membership (<0.5). The highest accuracy was achieved with a larger set of 33 attributes selected from combined time series and EPCA results (overall accuracy 95.0%, kappa 0.94); however, accuracies with smaller sets of variables from input image series or EPCA results alone were comparably high (93.1% and 94.7%, respectively). All three selected attribute sets included standard deviations of image and/or EPCA values, suggesting the utility of object texture in dynamic class discrimination. The highest classification uncertainty was observed primarily along the mapped class boundaries, in some cases indicating minor change trajectories for which prior reference data were not available. Results indicate that DCTs provide a reasonable classification framework for complex and variable Poyang Lake wetlands that can be facilitated by EPCA transformation of complementary remote sensing time series. Future work should test this approach over multiple change cycles and assess sensitivity of results to temporal frequency of input image series, alternative variable selection algorithms and other remote sensors.

This needs the long-term monitoring of tailings, sediments and water along the river, and the understanding of how the tailings interact physically and geochemically with the natural sediments and flowing water. An effort of this kind is uncommon because of its cost and opportunity. The purpose of this study was to help filling this gap using the rupture of B1 tailings dam (Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil, 25 January 2019) as example. To accomplish the objective, 31 parameters of tailings, sediment and water were monitored weekly for three years after the event, spanning impacted and non-impacted sectors of Paraopeba River, including a dam reservoir that is attenuating the tailings propagation downstream. Using hi-erarchical clustering analysis, the parameters were assembled into groups. Associations between parameters within the groups pointed to processes and drivers controlling the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Al, As, Pb and P in water. The results suggested reductive dissolution of Pb-and Mn-bearing minerals in the impacted and dam reservoir sectors as key process. In the rainy period, dissolved Mn concentrations in the impacted sector raised exponentially with temperature increase; in the dam reservoir, they showed episodic peaks triggered by thermal stratification-related pH decreases. In general, total concentrations > dissolved concentrations indicating pre-dominant particle transport. Besides, concentrations were higher for Fe, Al and Mn, in the rainy season, and in the impacted sector. In the dry season, stream flow-controlled sediment resuspension triggered desorption of Fe and Al from sand grains raising their dissolved concentrations. In the rainy season, a pH declining trend probably related with erosion of acid soils in the watershed caused gradual increases of Fe, Al and P, desorbed from clays and silts. The main conclusion is that the B1 dam rupture left a strong fingerprint in the concentrations of Fe and Mn in the river, especially in the rainy season, which lasts and keeps the use of Paraopeba River suspended.

Here, we determine the mechanistic controls on the processes that drive P release from the sediments in Lake of the Woods (LOW). The vertical distributions of the relevant diagenetic parameters-including oxygen, pH, redox potential, dissolved P, iron (Fe) and other metals in the porewater-were measured, and the fluxes of dissolved oxygen and P across the sediment-water interface (SWI) at the four locations in LOW were quantified. We characterized solid P speciation and analyzed the iron and corresponding metal contents in five sediment P binding forms. Shortterm diffusive fluxes of P ranged between 0.3 and 7.8 mg m(-2)d(-1), controlled by the mineralization of freshly deposited organic matter and the redox-sensitive iron cycle. Long-term net P release rates were between 0.21 and 9.96 mg m(-2)d(-1), controlled by the diagenetic remineralization of P binding pools, which regulates longterm sediment P releases. Hypoxia may have led to the release of previously stored FeeP in the sediments, which has likely increased internal P loading for a timescale that is longer than seasonal. While Fe-sorbed phosphorus is the major barrier for P release in the surface sediments, P is immobilized in deep sediments via the formation of calcium (Ca)-P, aluminum (Al)-P, and possibly vivianite. Our study demonstrates the importance of sediments as sources of the productivity-limiting nutrient phosphorus; reveals the geochemical controls on sediment P release; and helps further the understanding of how sediments regulate water quality and affect eutrophication and the possibility of algal blooms.

Integrating watershed and ecosystem service models to assess best management practice efficiency: guidelines for Lake Erie managers and watershed modellers	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Lake Erie is the shallowest and most biologically productive system of the Great Lakes, surrounded by large urban, industrial, and agricultural areas. This combination prompted extensive efforts to promote best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate non-point source pollution in Lake Erie's watershed. Recent technical and conceptual advancements caution that significant variability exists in the BMP efficiency to reduce the severity of runoff and nutrient concentrations due to differences in implementation, the dependence of operational performance on local soil and climatic conditions, storm events and seasonality, and declining performance over time owing to imperfect maintenance. Given the uncertainty surrounding the design and efficiency of BMPs in abating non-point source pollution, our primary objective is to review the critical strengths and potential weaknesses of nine agricultural BMPs promoted for use in the Lake Erie watershed. We examine the capacity of the current generation of watershed process-based models to recreate possible BMP-mediated changes in the water and nutrient cycles. After reviewing modelling strategies (dynamic, external forcing, and empirical) to recreate non-linear watershed responses and feedback loops to BMP efficiency, our study recommends adopting dynamic representations of the interplay among key mechanisms, like soil moisture, water table, nutrient availability, plant uptake, and subsequent growth. Notwithstanding the increased sophistication of complex mathematical models, their learning capacity is usually compromised by the coarse resolution of environmental data and limited empirical knowledge to accurately parameterize environmental properties and partially understood biogeochemical processes. Moreover, BMPs may differentially affect the provisions of an ecosystem (e.g., a BMP may amplify one ecosystem service while dampening another). In this context, we highlight the expression of the value of ecosystem services in monetary and non-monetary terms as a critical information piece when considering trade-offs among costly and diverse policy decisions. Our study also examines the degree to which different types of valuation methods, socioeconomic models, and data have been operationalized in Lake Erie. Consistent with the Integrated Watershed Management framework, we advocate the adoption of a rigorous mass-balance approach to assess the impact of BMPs on nutrient cycles, as well as the integration of the projected environmental improvements with terrestrial ecosystem services, beneficial use impairments, and aquatic ecosystem services. The proposed strategy has the potential to improve the decision-making process by identifying cost-effective management actions and balancing different goods and services provided by the agroecosystems at different time scales.

The present study aimed to analyze the rainfall variability and trends in the Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB) over a period from 1953 to 2014. Variability analysis showed that the basin has been suffering from variable rainfall events causing severe droughts and floods over different years. According to precipitation concentration index calculations, the basin had irregular and strong irregular rainfall distribution over the annual and dry seasons, while the basin had a uniform and moderate rainfall distribution during the rainy season and small rainy season. For the total annual rainfall, Mann-Kendall test indicated that, for the eastern central part of the basin, a significant increasing trend of 12.85 mm/year occurred over the studied period, while, for the southwestern part of the basin, a significant decrease of 17.78 mm/year occurred. For the rainy season, a significant increasing trend over the northeastern and eastern central parts of the basin with the magnitude of 3.330-12.625 mm/year occurred. Trend analysis was applied on the monthly averaged rainfall over the whole basin and revealed that July and August are the most contributors of rainfall to the basin with 23.32% and 22.65%. Changing point assessment revealed that at Lake Tana outlet there is a decreasing of the rainfall of 17.7% after 1977 that matched with the trend analysis results. The data and results contained herein provide updated information about the current situation in the UBNB. The results can be used to predict future precipitation and estimate the uncertainty in future precipitation prediction models.

J	Ellsworth, PZ; Sternberg, LSL				Ellsworth, Patrick Z.; Sternberg, Leonel S. L.			Seasonal water use by deciduous and evergreen woody species in a scrub community is based on water availability and root distribution	ECOHYDROLOGY												In a seasonally dry plant community of central Florida, USA, that experiences water limitation in the dry season and high water availability in the wet season, we first tested whether evergreen woody species shift from shallow water in the wet season to deep water in the dry season. Second, we tested whether deciduous woody species restrict water uptake to the shallow soil during the wet season and cease water uptake during the dry season. To address these questions, we measured water source use of two deciduous and three evergreen species over 13months using stable isotopes. As hypothesized in previous studies, we showed that leaflessness in deciduous plants is an important source of stem water isotopic fractionation. Therefore, we compared stable isotope ratios of stem water only when deciduous species had leaves and found that all species, except the evergreen Lyonia ferruginea, used proportionally the same water sources. Early dry season water use was based on water availability for all species except L. ferruginea, and deep soil (50-150cm) was the most important water source. During the late dry and wet seasons, water uptake from each soil layer was based on its respective proportion of fine roots. Nevertheless, deep water remained an important water source throughout the year. This study clearly demonstrates the limitations of using stable isotopes of stem water when comparing deciduous versus evergreen species. Further, this study is the first to directly quantify depth of water uptake via isotope analysis and couple these findings with root distribution. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

K.; Yorke, Charles			Trends and interannual variability of extreme rainfall indices over Ghana, West Africa	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Rainfall plays an important role in the socio-economic development of any nation. Below or above normal rainfall amounts have serious consequences on key socio-economic sectors. This is particularly true for countries such as Ghana where rainfall plays a key role in the agriculture and energy sectors. In this study, the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS)-homogenized daily rainfall series was used to determine the variability of ten extreme rainfall indices recommended by the World Meteorological Organization-Commission for Climatology (WMO-CCL) and the research project on Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR). The trends of these indices and their links to SST anomalies at oceanic basins were also explored in this study. To understand the variability at interannual to decadal time scales and links with SST forcings, the sum of the first three principal components of the indices were correlated with SST anomalies at oceanic basins. The 35 years mean of frequency indices, CDD, CWD, R10mm and R20mm were found to be in a range of 10-125, 6-14, 30-60 and 8-24 days per year, respectively. On the other hand, the mean over the same period of intensity indices PRCPTOT, R95p, R99p, SDII, RX1day and RX5day were in the range of 900-1700 mm, 200-400 mm, 40-130 mm, 9-13 mm, 30-100 mm and 90-180 mm per year, respectively. The maximum of temporally averaged intensity indices covers southwestern Ghana, while the minimum of the indices lies over northwestern and eastern coasts. A significant decreasing trend in wet indices were observed over the Volta Lake and central portions of the country (7.5 degrees N to 9.5 degrees N), whereas low positive trends were observed over the Northern parts of the country. Wet indices over the country showed significant positive correlations with the Atlantic Ocean SST and negative correlations with the Pacific and Indian basins SSTs. Specifically, the NINO3.4 revealed significant negative correlations with the wet indices over the west-central portions of the country. IOD was observed to have a dipole effect on rainfall indices with the central and southern parts generally covered by negative correlations, while Northern and coastal regions showed positive correlations. The impacts of Atlantic SST on wet rainfall indices are significant over most parts of the country. These results have implications on the improvement of seasonal forecast of the Ghanaian rainfall and its extremes and also provide prior knowledge for better understandings of multidecadal modulations of global interannual teleconnections.

J	Guo, WX; Yang, H; Zhou, HT; Wang, HX				Guo, Wenxian; Yang, Huan; Zhou, Haotong; Wang, Hongxiang			Synergistic changes in river-lake runoff systems in the Yangtze River basin and their driving force differences	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Climate change and human activities simultaneously alter river-lake relationships. Determining the dynamics of river-lake runoff systems on multiple time scales and their differences in response to driving forces can provide insights into hydrological processes and water resource management. This study investigates the synergistic evolution of river-lake runoff systems in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLYR) using the cross-wavelet transform method. The effects of different driving force changes on river-lake runoff regimes are quantified based on the Budyko hypothesis, and an InVEST model is developed to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of habitat quality. The results indicate that during the variation period, the runoff distributions of the Yangtze River-Dongting Lake and Yangtze River--Poyang Lake runoff systems are both skewed towards lower values in the flood seasons compared with those in the base period. The storage of lakes mitigates the extent of human disturbance to the mainstream hydrological regime, particularly under extremely low condi-tions. From 1960 to 2021, five significant resonance periods are indicated in the river-lake runoff system, and the phase-angle relationships indicate a positive phase coupling between the lake and mainstream hydrological regimes, with the lake lagging behind the mainstream; however, this interaction tends to weaken. In the mainstream and Dongting Lake basins, subsurface conditions are the dominant factor contributing to runoff variability, with contributions ranging from 50.9% to 72.6%; in the Poyang Lake basin, precipitation is the dominant factor, with a contribution of 50.6%; and in the Han River basin, changes in the potential evapo-transpiration contribute to 50.6% of runoff variability. The proportion of high habitat quality in the MLYR is approximately 52%, the Dongting and Poyang Lake basins indicate a high habitat quality rating. However, frequent human activity is the main reason of conversion from higher habitats to lower ones, which may result in wetland habitat degradation.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				JUL	2023	75								102069	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102069		MAR 2023											WOS:000957827400001

However, in heavily eutrophic aquatic ecosystems, the purification function of SMs is often restricted by the poor growth state due to competition from algae, while the purification function of AMs is often restricted by the limited carbon source supply for biofilm microbes attached to the AM surface. The objective of this study was to develop a new strategy to increase pollutant removal efficiency (RE) by combining the use of SMs and AMs. Pilot-scale microcosms, including treatments with both SMs and AMs (S&A), only SMs (SO) and only AMs (AO), were established to identify the performance of the new strategy. The results suggest that treatment S&A obtained REs of 88.9% for total nitrogen (TN) and 48.1% for chemical oxygen demand (COD); as comparison, treatments SO and AO obtained REs of 77.4% and 81.2% for TN and REs of -13.7% and 39.0% for COD, respectively. Compared with SO, the S&A treatment benefited SM growth in biomass, leaf chlorophyll concentration and root activity by inhibiting algae growth. In addition, compared with treatment AO, S&A increased the biofilm microbial biomass and the relative abundance of nitrifiers of families Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospira attached to AM surfaces. Therefore, by the mutual promotion of SMs and biofilms on AMs, the synergic application of SMs and AMs is a useful strategy for improving TN and COD REs in eutrophic water bodies such as rivers and constructed wetlands. A strategy was developed to increase nitrogen and COD removal in eutrophic water by the mutual promotion of submerged macrophytes and biofilms on artificial macrophytes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Drought risk assessment using remote sensing and GIS techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Beginning with a discussion of drought definitions, this review paper attempts to provide a review of fundamental concepts of drought, classification of droughts, drought indices, and the role of remote sensing and geographic information systems for drought evaluation. Owing to the rise in water demand and looming climate change, recent years have witnessed much focus on global drought scenarios. As a natural hazard, drought is best characterized by multiple climatological and hydrological parameters. An understanding of the relationships between these two sets of parameters is necessary to develop measures for mitigating the impacts of droughts. Droughts are recognized as an environmental disaster and have attracted the attention of environmentalists, ecologists, hydrologists, meteorologists, geologists, and agricultural scientists. Temperatures; high winds; low relative humidity; and timing and characteristics of rains, including distribution of rainy days during crop growing seasons, intensity, and duration of rain, and onset and termination, play a significant role in the occurrence of droughts. In contrast to aridity, which is a permanent feature of climate and is restricted to low rainfall areas, a drought is a temporary aberration. Often, there is confusion between a heat wave and a drought, and the distinction is emphasized between heat wave and drought, noting that a typical time scale associated with a heat wave is on the order of a week, while a drought may persist for months or even years. The combination of a heat wave and a drought has dire socio-economic consequences. Drought risk is a product of a region's exposure to the natural hazard and its vulnerability to extended periods of water shortage. If nations and regions are to make progress in reducing the serious consequences of drought, they must improve their understanding of the hazard and the factors that influence vulnerability. It is critical for drought-prone regions to better understand their drought climatology (i.e., the probability of drought at different levels of intensity and duration) and establish comprehensive and integrated drought information system that incorporates climate, soil, and water supply factors such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, snow pack, reservoir and lake levels, ground water levels, and stream flow. All drought-prone nations should develop national drought policies and preparedness plans that place emphasis on risk management rather than following the traditional approach of crisis management, where the emphasis is on reactive, emergency response measures. Crisis management decreases self-reliance and increases dependence on government and donors.

Four different clusters were identified based on their similar physicochemical characteristics. The majority of sites in upper (Laos and Thailand) and middle part (Cambodia) of the basin were grouped in two clusters, considered as good quality water with high DO and low nutrient levels. The other two clusters were mostly composed of sites in Mekong delta (Vietnam) and few sites in upstream tributaries (i.e., northwestern Thailand, Tonle Sap Lake, and swamps close to Vientiane), known for moderate to poor quality of water and characterized by high nutrient and dissolved solid levels. Overall, we found that the water in the mainstream was less polluted than its tributaries; eutrophication and salinity could be key factors affecting water quality in LMB. Moreover, the seasonal variation of water quality seemed to be less marked than spatial variation occurring along the longitudinal gradient of Mekong River. Significant degradations were mainly associated with human disturbance and particularly apparent in sites distributed along the man-made canals in Vietnam delta where population growth and agricultural development are intensive.

However, the quantification of such connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods, especially in delta plains. In this study, based on the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations, a new and quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index (LFCI) was developed for delta plains. Focusing on the Taihu Plain, we then analysed the spatial-temporal changes in the LFCI during 1960-2012 and investigated the correlations between the LFCI and climate change and human activities. We found that the decadal, annual and seasonal changes in the average LFCI all presented slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period, but the annual average LFCI increased significantly after 1978; the average LFCIs in June, July, and August of the flood season were less than those in other months in the Taihu Plain. We also found that the spatial-temporal changes in the average LFCI exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station scales; those in the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu subregion were least, and the average LFCIs at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations. Moreover, we found that the average LFCI had significant correlations with precipitation, river density and water surface ratio. Our results were consistent with common sense facts, which demonstrated that the indicator developed in this study can quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains.

J	Kisakye, V; Van der Bruggen, B				Kisakye, Violet; Van der Bruggen, Bart			Effects of climate change on water savings and water security from rainwater harvesting systems	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												Climate change presents major uncertainties in future safe water access especially in rural communities that are already faced with water insecurity. For Uganda, rainwater harvesting has become a major adaptation strategy to ensure the attainment of safe water access for all. However, climate change effects on rainwater harvesting potential remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper assesses climate change effects on water savings and water security from rainwater harvesting systems for Kabarole district, Uganda. The top performing Global circulation models (GCMs), used in this study included; MIROC5, BCC-CSM-1-M, CNRM-CM5, ACCESS1-0, HADGEM2-ES and HADGEM2-CC using projections for 2025-2055 (2040s) and 2060-2090 (2070s) periods. Seasonal analysis used the 4 seasons for Uganda, namely; the 2 dry seasons of December, January, February (DJF) and June, July, August (JJA) and the 2 rainy seasons of September, October, November (SON) and March, April, May (MAM). Although there are conflicting model predictions, generally, the models agree that water savings and security will reduce in DJF and MAM and increase in JJA and SON seasons. MAM rain season will be most affected with water savings and security projected to reduce by more than 50% in the 2070s period. Therefore, households should harness the increased water savings in JJA and SON to cater for the predicted reduction in water savings in MAM and DJF seasons especially for the 2070s period. A larger tank of 5 m(3) along with at least 50 m(2) roof size combined with a low cost household water treatment is thus recommended.					; Van der Bruggen, Bart/AAR-3676-2020	Kisakye, Violet/0000-0002-7162-4780; Van der Bruggen, Bart/0000-0002-3921-7472													0921-3449	1879-0658				NOV	2018	138						49	63		10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.07.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.07.009													WOS:000444789400007

To date, the genus has been considered to contain only heterotrophic species. In this study, we detected the photosynthesis genes pufLM and bchY in 28 of 46 strains from three Limnohabitans lineages. The pufM sequences obtained are very closely related to environmental pufM sequences detected in various freshwater habitats, indicating the ubiquity and potential importance of photoheterotrophic Limnohabitans in nature. Additionally, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 5 potentially photoheterotrophic Limnohabitans strains, to gain further insights into their phototrophic capacity. The structure of the photosynthesis gene cluster turned out to be highly conserved within the genus Limnohabitans and also among all potentially photosynthetic Betaproteobacteria strains. The expression of photosynthetic complexes was detected in a culture of Limnohabitans planktonicus II-D5T using spectroscopic and pigment analyses. This was further verified by a novel combination of infrared microscopy and fluorescent in situ hybridization. IMPORTANCE The data presented document that the capacity to perform anoxy-genic photosynthesis is common among the members of the genus Limnohabitans, indicating that they may have a novel role in freshwater habitats.					; Kasalicky, Vojtech/F-8578-2014; Koblizek, Michal/H-2851-2014; Piwosz, Kasia/B-1131-2010; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021; Zeng, Yonghui/C-5663-2008	Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Kasalicky, Vojtech/0000-0002-9132-8321; Piwosz, Kasia/0000-0002-3248-3364; Koblizek, Michal/0000-0001-6938-2340; ZENG, YONGHUI/0000-0001-7483-5017; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JAN	2018	84	1							e02116-17	10.1128/AEM.02116-17	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02116-17								29030444					WOS:000418039700029

Shifts in the Source and Composition of Dissolved Organic Matter in Southwest Greenland Lakes Along a Regional Hydro-climatic Gradient	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and quality were examined from Arctic lakes located in three clusters across south-west (SW) Greenland, covering the regional climatic gradient: cool, wet coastal zone; dry inland interior; and cool, dry ice-marginal areas. We hypothesized that differences in mean annual precipitation between sites would result in a reduced hydrological connectivity between lakes and their catchments and that this concentrates degraded DOM. The DOM in the inland lake group was characterized by a lower aromaticity and molecular weight, a low soil-like fluorescence, and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13-DOC) values enriched by similar to 2% relative to the coastal group. DOC-specific absorbance (SUVA(254)) and DOC-specific soil-like fluorescence (SUVFC1) revealed seasonal and climatic gradients across which DOM exhibited a dynamic we term "pulse-process": Pulses of DOM exported from soils to lakes during snow and ice melt were followed by pulses of autochthonous DOM inputs (possibly from macrophytes), and their subsequent photochemical and microbial processing. These effects regulated the dynamics of DOM in the inland lakes and suggested that if circumpolar lakes currently situated in cool wetter climatic regimes with strong hydrological connectivity have reduced connectivity under a drier future climate, they may evolve toward an end-point of large stocks of highly degraded DOC, equivalent to the inland lakes in the present study. The regional climatic gradient across SW Greenland and its influence on DOM properties in these lakes provide a model of possible future changes to lake C cycling in high-latitude systems where climatic changes are most pronounced. Plain Language Summary Arctic regions are currently experiencing change due to warming climate, and Arctic lakes are natural recorders of this change. We conducted a study of 20 Arctic lakes situated across a climatic gradient in southwest Greenland ranging from cool and wet coastal region to a warm and dry inland region. We found that Arctic carbon cycles are responding to this change by concentrating dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a collection of molecules that form the basis of lake food webs, which may be very old and represent long-term accumulation of carbon in these lake waters. We suspect that the force driving this change is a loss of the connectivity between these lakes and their watersheds. Under this scenario, lakes receive less organic carbon from soils in their surrounding watersheds and perhaps more from fringing aquatic plants. Moreover, earlier loss of lake ice may lead to longer open water periods and the chance for sunlight to convert DOC to carbon dioxide, representing a feedback to regional climate. As global change influences the Arctic broadly, modifications to the hydrologic connectivity of lakes to their watersheds may have important implications for Arctic inland C cycling.					; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010; Dumbrell, Alex/JOZ-4243-2023; McGenity, Terry/B-8661-2011; Stedmon, Colin/B-5841-2008	Underwood, Graham/0000-0001-5605-0697; Dumbrell, Alex/0000-0001-6282-3043; Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202; McGenity, Terence/0000-0002-1497-8822; Stedmon, Colin/0000-0001-6642-9692													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2017	122	12					3431	3445		10.1002/2017JG003999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JG003999													WOS:000423221300021

Our study explored the spatial variations of soil P forms and the risks of P release in the WLFZ in a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Soil samples from multiple altitudes (145, 155 and 165 m) in the WLFZ, upland soils (175 m) as well as reservoir sediment samples were collected along seven transects in a tributary of the TGR (Pengxi River) in August 2016. Hedley's fractionation method was used to characterize the P forms, and the physical and chemical properties of the samples were determined. The distributions of the total P (TP) across the transects decreased in the order of sediments (675.9 +/- 124.8 mg/kg), upland soil (658.9 +/- 191.1 mg/kg), and WLFZ soil (613.9 +/- 100.7 mg/kg). Similar distributions of the bioavailable P (Bio-P) were observed. Longitudinally, the TP and Bio-P of the WLFZ soil gradually decreased from the estuary to the upstream of the tributary. The spatial variations of P in the WLFZ soil in the tributary of the TGR was influenced by the soil particle size distribution (PSD) that, in turn, was a result of joint effects of the anti-seasonal hydrological regime, rainfall erosion and mainstream backwater. Long-term flooding increased P release from soil and decreased the soil degree of P saturation (DPS) throughout the WLFZ, especially in the lower portion of the WLFZ. According to Water-P, molar Al:Fe ratio and DPS, the current risk of soil P release throughout the WLFZ are very low. Monitoring should be prioritized at an altitude of 165 m and in the estuary of the WLFZ considering the high DPS and/or low Al:Fe ratio in these areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the fate of methane (CH4) in sediments of a thermokarst lagoon in comparison to two thermokarst lakes on the Bykovsky Peninsula in northeastern Siberia through the analysis of sediment CH4 concentrations and isotopic signature, methane-cycling microbial taxa, sediment geochemistry, lipid biomarkers, and network analysis. We assessed how differences in geochemistry between thermokarst lakes and thermokarst lagoons, caused by the infiltration of sulfate-rich marine water, altered the microbial methane-cycling community. Anaerobic sulfate-reducing ANME-2a/2b methanotrophs dominated the sulfate-rich sediments of the lagoon despite its known seasonal alternation between brackish and freshwater inflow and low sulfate concentrations compared to the usual marine ANME habitat. Non-competitive methylotrophic methanogens dominated the methanogenic community of the lakes and the lagoon, independent of differences in porewater chemistry and depth. This potentially contributed to the high CH4 concentrations observed in all sulfate-poor sediments. CH4 concentrations in the freshwater-influenced sediments averaged 1.34 +/- 0.98 mu mol g(-1), with highly depleted delta C-13-CH4 values ranging from -89 parts per thousand to -70 parts per thousand. In contrast, the sulfate-affected upper 300 cm of the lagoon exhibited low average CH4 concentrations of 0.011 +/- 0.005 mu mol g(-1) with comparatively enriched delta C-13-CH4 values of -54 parts per thousand to -37 parts per thousand pointing to substantial methane oxidation. Our study shows that lagoon formation specifically supports methane oxidizers and methane oxidation through changes in pore water chemistry, especially sulfate, while methanogens are similar to lake conditions.

Fine-scale acoustic telemetry reveals unexpected lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, spawning habitats in northern Lake Huron, North America	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Previous studies of lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, spawning habitat in the Laurentian Great Lakes have used time- and labour-intensive survey methods and have focused on areas with historic observations of spawning aggregations and on habitats prejudged by researchers to be suitable for spawning. As an alternative, we used fine-scale acoustic telemetry to locate, describe and compare lake trout spawning habitats. Adult lake trout were implanted with acoustic transmitters and tracked during five consecutive spawning seasons in a 19-27km(2) region of the Drummond Island Refuge, Lake Huron, using the VEMCO Positioning System. Acoustic telemetry revealed discrete areas of aggregation on at least five reefs in the study area, subsequently confirmed by divers to contain deposited eggs. Notably, several identified spawning sites would likely not have been discovered using traditional methods because either they were too small and obscure to stand out on a bathymetric map or because they did not conform to the conceptual model of spawning habitat held by many biologists. Our most unique observation was egg deposition in gravel and rubble substrates located at the base of and beneath overhanging edges of large boulders. Spawning sites typically comprised <10% of the reef area and were used consistently over the 5-year study. Evaluation of habitat selection from the perspective of fish behaviour through use of acoustic transmitters offers potential to expand current conceptual models of critical spawning habitat.

The results suggested that hypoxia significantly promotes the release of P from sediments and the release of P under hypoxic condition mostly comes from the release of BD P. Together with the in-situ and high resolution evidences from DGT and microelectrode, the release of P from sediments under hypoxic condition was assumed to be coupled processes which are associated with the combined cycles of "P-Fe-S". Evidences from the present work implied that the internal P loadings induced by hypoxia, especially after a reduction of external P-loading, should be paid more attention in eutrophic deep-water reservoirs, Southwest China.

Timothy; Falck, Hendrik			Organic matter control on the distribution of arsenic in lake sediments impacted by ∼65 years of gold ore processing in subarctic Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate change is profoundly affecting seasonality, biological productivity, and hydrology in high northern latitudes. In sensitive subarctic environments exploitation of mineral resources led to contamination and it is not known how cumulative effects of resource extraction and climate warming will impact ecosystems. Gold mines near Yellow knife, Northwest Territories, subarctic Canada, operated from 1938 to 2004 and released N 20,000 t of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) to the environment through stack emissions. This release resulted in elevated arsenic concentrations in lake surface waters and sediments relative to Canadian drinking water standards and guidelines for the protection of aquatic life. A meta-analytical approach is used to better understand controls on As distribution in lake sediments within a 30-kmradius of historicmineral processing activities. Arsenic concentrations in the near-surface sediments range from 5 mg.kg(-1) to over 10,000 mg.kg(-1) (median 81 mg.kg(-1); n = 105). Distance and direction from the historic roaster stack are significantly (p < 0.05) related to sedimentary As concentration, with highest As concentrations in sediments within 11 km and lakes located downwind. Synchrotron-based mu XRF and mu XRD confirm the persistence of As2O3 in near surface sediments of two lakes. Labile organic matter (S1) is significantly (p < 0.05) related to As and S concentrations in sediments and this relationship is greatest in lakes within 11 km from the mine. These relations are interpreted to reflect labile organic matter acting as a substrate for microbial growth and mediation of authigenic precipitation of As-sulphides in lakes close to the historic mine where As concentrations are highest. Continued climate warming is expected to lead to increased biological productivity and changes in organic geochemistry of lake sediments that are likely to play an important role in the mobility and fate of As in aquatic ecosystems.

Metabarcoding reveals strong spatial structure and temporal turnover of zooplankton communities among marine and freshwater ports	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimThe urgent need for large-scale spatio-temporal assessments of biodiversity in the face of rapid environmental change prompts technological advancements in species identification and biomonitoring such as metabarcoding. The high-throughput DNA sequencing of bulk samples offers many advantages over traditional morphological identification for describing community composition. Our objective was to evaluate the applicability of metabarcoding to identify species in taxonomically complex samples, evaluate biodiversity trends across broad geographical and temporal scales and facilitate cross-study comparisons. LocationMarine and freshwater ports along Canadian coastlines (Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic) and the Great Lakes. MethodsWe used metabarcoding of bulk zooplankton samples to identify species and profile biodiversity across habitats and seasons in busy commercial ports. A taxonomic assignment approach circumventing sequence clustering was implemented to provide increased resolution and accuracy compared to pre-clustering. ResultsTaxonomic classification of over seven million sequences identified organisms spanning around 400 metazoan families and complements previous surveys based on morphological identification. Metabarcoding revealed over 30 orders that were previously not reported, while certain taxonomic groups were underrepresented because of depauperate reference databases. Despite the limitations of assigning metabarcoding data to the species level, zooplankton communities were distinct among coastlines and significantly divergent among marine, freshwater and estuarine habitats even at the family level. Furthermore, biodiversity varied substantially across two seasons reaching a beta diversity of 0.9 in a sub-Arctic port exposed to high vessel traffic. Main ConclusionsMetabarcoding offers a powerful and sensitive approach to conduct large-scale biodiversity surveys and allows comparability across studies when rooted in taxonomy. We highlight ways of overcoming current limitations of metabarcoding for identifying species and assessing biodiversity, which has important implications for detecting organisms at low abundance such as endangered species and early invaders. Our study conveys pertinent and timely considerations for future large-scale monitoring surveys in relationship to environmental change.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Cristescu, Melania/H-3401-2018	Cristescu, Melania/0000-0002-0854-4040													1366-9516	1472-4642				MAY	2016	22	5					493	504		10.1111/ddi.12427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12427													WOS:000374158100001

Assessment of water quality and apportionment of pollution sources of an urban lake using multivariate statistical analysis	CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY												The Lake Gulshan has gained special attention to restore its water quality for public health safety, congenial lake bund, and aquatic lives as the lake is a popular recreational place and neighbourhood of critical residential and diplomatic zones. Therefore, this study assessed water quality and pollution sources of Lake Gulshan, located in the city of Dhaka in Bangladesh during dry and wet seasons, using the water quality index (WQI) rating system, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model. Extremely low levels of dissolved oxygen (as low as 0.2 mg/L in the dry season and 0.8 mg/L in the wet season) in the lake water suggest that it is almost impossible for any living organisms to survive. Consequently, high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD, a measure of biodegradable organic matter up to 80 mg/L), Phosphate, and Nitrate (indicators of eutrophication potential as far as 5.06 mg-P/L and 228 mg-N/L) were detected in the lake water, indicating severe anthropogenic pollution. A strong correlation (Pearson with 2-tailed t-test, r = 0.85 in the dry season, r = 0.76 in the wet season, p < 0.05) between color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) demonstrates the pollution of lake water due to mixing effluent resulted from surrounding garments and dying industries. The WQI rating systems proposed by the National sanitation foundation (NSF) and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) show that the lake's water quality is in poor or bad condition and has become a growing concern for a looming ecological severe danger. Both PCA and PMF models have apportioned four factors as pollution sources in the lake water during dry and wet seasons. PCA's four factors explain 86.41% and 80.97% variances of the dataset during dry and wet seasons, respectively. PMF receptor model estimates that the point source of nutrients contributes to 42.94% of the total pollution generated by municipal wastewater discharge during the dry season. Hence, municipal waste discharges through the point sources are the leading causes of lake water pollution in the dry season. However, a non-point source of surface runoff shares 41.80% of the total pollution in the wet season generated by soil leaching runoff. This study could help the concerned authorities for the policymaking with strict regulations to protect water quality, proper management, and control pollution of the lake water.

The influence of this phenomena on surface and subsurface water resources has not yet been investigated, largely due to lack of enough in situ measurements compounded by the spatial coverage of the lake's basin, incomplete/inconsistent hydrometeorological data, and unavailable governmental data. Within the framework of joint data assimilation into a land surface model from multi-mission satellite remote sensing, this study employs the state-of-art Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment follow-on (GRACE-FO) time-variable terrestrial water storage (TWS), newly released ERA-5 reanalysis, and satellite radar altimetry products to understand the cause of the rise of Lake Victoria on the one hand, and the associated impacts of the rise on the total water storage compartments (surface and groundwater) triggered by the extreme climatic event on the other hand. In addition, the study investigates the impacts of large-scale ocean-atmosphere indices on the water storage changes. The results indicate a considerable increase in water storage over the past two years, with multiple subsequent positive trends mainly induced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Significant storage increase is also quantified in various water components such as surface water and water discharge, where the results show the lake's water level rose by similar to 1.4 m, leading to approximately 1750 gigatonne volume increase. Multiple positive trends are observed in the past two years in the lake's water storage increase with two major events in April-May 2019 and December 2019-January 2020, with the rainfall occurring during the short rainy season of September to November (SON) having had a dominant effect on the lake's rise.					khaki, m/JVN-9238-2024	Khaki, Mehdi/0000-0002-3718-2843; Awange, Joseph/0000-0003-3533-613X														1424-8220				JUL	2021	21	13							4304	10.3390/s21134304	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21134304								34201871					WOS:000671095800001

The dominant and most diverse bacterioplankton phyla were among the more frequently reported in freshwater ecosystems, including the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes. As a distinctive feature, the development of the BCC showed a cyclical temporal pattern in the two analyzed years and throughout the euphotic layer. The recurring temporal development was controlled by the strong seasonality in water temperature and thermal stratification, and by cyclical temporal changes in nutrients and, possibly, by the remarkable annual cyclical development of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton hosting bacterioplankton that characterizes Lake Garda. Further downstream analyses of operational taxonomic units associated to cyanobacteria allowed confirming the presence of the most abundant taxa previously identified by microscopy and/or phylogenetic analyses, as well as the presence of other small Synechococcales/Chroococcales and rare Nostocales never identified so far in the deep lakes south of the Alps. The implications of the high diversity and strong seasonality are relevant, opening perspectives for the definition of common and discriminating patterns characterizing the temporal and spatial distribution in the BCC, and for the application of the new sequencing technologies in the monitoring of water quality in large and deep lakes.					; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015; Albanese, Davide/AAA-7295-2021; Boscaini, Alberto/I-7538-2019; Donati, Claudio/AAF-1246-2020	Capelli, Camilla/0000-0002-4617-305X; Albanese, Davide/0000-0002-9493-3850; Salmaso, Nico/0000-0001-6057-3642; Pindo, Massimo/0000-0002-8516-9010; Donati, Claudio/0000-0001-8688-1651													0095-3628	1432-184X				JUL	2018	76	1			SI		125	143		10.1007/s00248-017-1120-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1120-x								29192335					WOS:000437836200014

In this study, a three-year field capping enclosure experiment combining intact sediment core incubation, in-situ porewater sampling, isotherm adsorption experiments and analysis of sediment nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fractions was conducted to assess the long-term perfor-mance of clean soil capping on internal loading in Lake Taihu. Our results indicate that clean soil has excellent P adsorption and retention capacity as an ecologically safe capping material and can effectively mitigate NH4+-N and SRP (soluble reactive P) fluxes at the sediment-water interface (SWI) and porewater SRP concentration for one year after capping. The mean NH4+-N and SRP fluxes of capping sediment were 34.86 mg m- 2 h-1 and-1.58 mg m- 2 h-1, compared 82.99 mg m- 2 h-1 and 6.29 mg m- 2 h-1 for control sediment. Clean soil controls internal NH4+-N release through cation (mainly Al3+) exchange mechanisms, while for SRP, clean soil can not only react with SRP due to its high Al and Fe content, but also stimulate the migration of active Ca2+ to the capping layer, thus precipitating as Ca-bound P (Ca-P). Clean soil capping also contributed to the restoration of macrophytes during the growing season. However, the effect of controlling internal nutrient loading only lasted for one year under in-situ conditions, after which the sediment properties returned to pre-capping conditions. Our results highlight that clean Ca-poor soil is a promising capping material and further research is needed to extend the longevity of this geoengineering technology.

Cyanobacterial Toxins of the Laurentian Great Lakes, Their Toxicological Effects, and Numerical Limits in Drinking Water	MARINE DRUGS												Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous phototrophic bacteria that inhabit diverse environments across the planet. Seasonally, they dominate many eutrophic lakes impacted by excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forming dense accumulations of biomass known as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs. Their dominance in eutrophic lakes is attributed to a variety of unique adaptations including N and P concentrating mechanisms, N-2 fixation, colony formation that inhibits predation, vertical movement via gas vesicles, and the production of toxic or otherwise bioactive molecules. While some of these molecules have been explored for their medicinal benefits, others are potent toxins harmful to humans, animals, and other wildlife known as cyanotoxins. In humans these cyanotoxins affect various tissues, including the liver, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive organs among others. They induce acute effects at low doses in the parts-per-billion range and some are tumor promoters linked to chronic diseases such as liver and colorectal cancer. The occurrence of cyanoHABs and cyanotoxins in lakes presents challenges for maintaining safe recreational aquatic environments and the production of potable drinking water. CyanoHABs are a growing problem in the North American (Laurentian) Great Lakes basin. This review summarizes information on the occurrence of cyanoHABs in the Great Lakes, toxicological effects of cyanotoxins, and appropriate numerical limits on cyanotoxins in finished drinking water.					; Miller, Todd/Y-3612-2019	Miller, Todd/0000-0002-2113-1662; 														1660-3397				JUN	2017	15	6							160	10.3390/md15060160	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md15060160								28574457					WOS:000404526900015

We detected biogeographic and genetic signatures associated with both mechanisms in the assembly of the biota of the European Alps. Age distributions of endemic and widespread species within aquatic and terrestrial taxa (amphipods, fishes, amphibians, butterflies and flowering plants) revealed that endemic fish evolved only in lakes, are highly sympatric, and mainly of Holocene age, consistent with adaptive radiation. Endemic amphipods are ancient, suggesting preglacial radiation with limited range expansion and local Pleistocene survival, perhaps facilitated by a groundwater-dwelling lifestyle. Terrestrial endemics are mostly of Pleistocene age and are thus more consistent with the glacial species pump. The lack of evidence for Holocene adaptive radiation in the terrestrial biome is consistent with faster recolonization through range expansion of these taxa after glacial retreats. More stable and less seasonal ecological conditions in lakes during the Holocene may also have contributed to Holocene speciation in lakes. The high proportion of young, endemic species makes the Alpine biota vulnerable to climate change, but the mechanisms and consequences of species loss will likely differ between biomes because of their distinct evolutionary histories.

Hydrochemical appraisal of surface water from a subtropical urban river in southwestern Bangladesh using indices, GIS, and multivariate statistical analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The Gorai River is a significant river in Bangladesh's southwestern region, where residents make great use of the water despite a lack of adequate and reliable information concerning water quality and pollution levels. Thus, the goal of this research was to examine the spatio-temporal variations in water quality and determine whether it was suitable for drinking, agriculture, industrial, or livestock purposes, as well as the influencing factors and potential sources of water pollution. Surface water samples were collected in wet and dry seasons from ten sampling sites, and twenty water quality parameters were evaluated. The results showed that some studied water quality parameters, e.g., temperature, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and nitrate, exceeded the maximum allowable limit. Water quality index values exhibited that the water quality of all sampling sites was found to be poor to very poor during the wet season, while only St-4 and St-5 were found to be poor and the rest of the investigated sites were good category during the dry season. Based on sodium adsorption ratio, soluble sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate, residual sodium bicarbonate, and permeability index values, it was depicted that river water was suitable for irrigation purposes, but when compared to Kelly's ratio (KR) and magnesium hazard ratio values, river water was found to be unfit for irrigation. Moreover, potential salinity (PS) and sodium-to-calcium activity ratio (SCAR) values allow the water as moderately suitable for use in irrigation purposes. Langelier saturation index (LSI) and aggressive index (AI) values revealed that the river water was under saturated to supersaturated and moderate to non-aggressive in nature. However, Ryznar stability index (RSI), Puckorius scaling index (PSI), and Larson-Skold index (LS) values describe whether the water was high or severely corrosive, signifying its inappropriateness for industrial consumption. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis depicted that the fluctuations in water quality are mostly related to point and non-point contaminations, such as urban and industrial effluent discharged and agricultural runoff of fertilizers. Cluster analysis (CA) revealed relative geographical and seasonal changes in water quality, showing the impact of hydrological changes and contamination.					; Idris, Abubakr/JWO-9124-2024; ISLAM, SHAFIQUL/KIK-4226-2024; Islam, Md/ABB-2487-2021; Idris, Abubakr/E-6452-2012; Hossain, Md.

Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is well-known for its ecological importance as a floodplain wetland. However, heterogeneity in vegetation extent and its response to water regimes across different geomorphic units of Poyang Lake remain unclear to date. To address this gap, Landsat images acquired during dry seasons from 1987 to 2018 were selected to explore vegetation extent and its response to water level fluctuations across multiple elevation bands and four wetland types, namely Riparian Wetland (RW), Delta Wetland (DW), Dish-shaped Wetland (DSW), and Fan-shaped wetland (FSW). Results show that vegetation extent in lower elevation bands of the four wetland types increased remarkably with an average increase rate of 0.53 km(2)/year between 2003 and 2018 compared to-0.17 km(2)/year(-1) during 1987 to 2002. Hydrological variables indicating high-flow events negatively affected vegetation extent in DSW while variables indicating low-flow events appear to be positive for vegetation extent in RW, DW, and FSW. Over-long floods as happened in 2016 has caused fatal damage to vegetation extent in DSW. In addition, extreme droughts in recent years caused by the Three Gorges Dam promoted significant (p < 0.05) vegetation expansion in lower elevation bands of RW, DW, and FSW, but a deterioration of vegetation extent in higher elevation bands, making Poyang Lake at risk of shrinkage and degradation. Human impacts on the evolution Poyang Lake system have caused wide concern, which also contribute to the proposal of Poyang Lake water control structure. Heterogeneity in vegetation extent and their response to water regimes across Poyang Lake provide precise spatial information for restoration efforts of the wetland ecosystem.					; Wang, XiaoLong/AGP-5220-2022	Zheng, Lilin/0000-0002-6170-930X; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAY	2021	124								107420	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107420		FEB 2021											WOS:000624332200004
J	Mei, XF; Dai, ZJ; Fagherazzi, S; Chen, JY				Mei, Xuefei; Dai, Zhijun; Fagherazzi, Sergio; Chen, Jiyu			Dramatic variations in emergent wetland area in China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Freshwater wetlands are important ecosystems experiencing rapid degradation around the world. As much as 64% of world's wetland area has been lost since 1900; the situation is even more serious in Asia, where land reclamation and anthropogenic modifications of rivers are increasing the rate of wetland disappearance. In this study, we provide a first complete estimation of daily Emergent Wetland Area (EWA) in Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, from 1955 to 2012. A wavelet analysis indicates a strong periodicity in the monthly EWA time series with two oscillations having a period of 12 and 60-72 months, respectively. A dramatic increase in mean annual EWA is detected since 2003, when the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) was completed, mainly due to the seasonal drying of 1078 km(2) of wetlands in October. It is found that the timing of wetland emergence during the dry season has been anticipated of one month, from November to October, since the establishment of TGD. It is argued that a significant increase in wetland exposure and an observable shift in the seasonal timing of flooding and drying will seriously degrade the wetland system and threaten the endangered migratory birds that inhabit it unless effective countermeasures are implemented.

Here, we present a three-year study of a paddy agricultural-urban area gradient watershed in southeast China. The annual anthropogenic nitrogen (N) input from the agricultural region to the urban region was high, yet the results showed that the monthly nutrient concentrations in the river were low in the rainy seasons. The nutrient concentrations decreased continuously as the river water passed through the traditional agriculture region (TAR; paddy rice and wheat rotation) and increased substantially in the city region (CR). The traditional agricultural reference region exported most of the nutrient loads at high flows (>1 mm d(-1)), the intensified agricultural region (IAR, aquaculture and poultry farming) exported most of the nutrient loads at moderate flows (between 0.5 and 1 mm d(-1)), and the CR reference area exported most of the nutrient loads under low to moderate flows. We developed a statistical model to link variations in the nutrient concentrations to the proportion of land-use types and rainfall. The statistical results showed that impervious surfaces, which we interpret as a proxy for urban activities including sewage disposal, were the most important drivers of nutrient concentrations, whereas water surfaces accounted for a substantial proportion of the nutrient sinks. Therefore, to efficiently reduce water pollution, sewage from urban areas must be addressed as a priority, although wet land restoration could also achieve substantial pollutant removal.

It was assumed that the increasing rainfall during flood season would affect the stoichiometric ratio of total nitrogen (TN): total phosphorus (TP), driving the nutrient limitation of algal growth. In order to test this concept and explore corresponding nutrient management strategies, nutrient addition bioassays were carried out in Xiangxi Bay, one of the largest tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China. Results indicated that nutrient limitation on algal growth fluctuated from nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) limitation. N limitation dominated in the early flood season. However, the reduction of dissolved P, accompanied with an increase of TN: TP caused by an increase in extreme rainfall events intensified P limitation throughout the bay. Then P limitation was alleviated due to the reduction of rainfall and the process of impoundment after the flood season. The variation of TN: TP caused by the increasing of rainfall and flooding could be the main driving factor of the nutrient limitation shift in aquatic ecosystems mainly affected by external nutrient inputs. Nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays showed that TN and TP concentration thresholds should be targeted at below 0.55 mg/L and 0.057 ~ 0.064 mg/L respectively, to limit the growth of algae and maintain chlorophyll a below 30 mu g/L. Dual nutrient (N & P) reductions were required for long-term bloom mitigation in the entire basin. This study provided a scientific basis for a nutrient management strategy to combat eutrophication and reduce algal bloom potentials in the tributaries of the TGR. We recommend that long-term determinations of nutrient limitation and nutrient threshold will be needed to control algal growth, considering future anticipated changes in land use, population density and the impacts of climate change.					; Nwankwegu, Amechi S./AAT-8365-2020; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; Yuan, Mingzhe/NRX-7642-2025; Nwankwegu, Amechi/AAT-8365-2020	Zhao, Xingxing/0000-0002-4136-3719; Nwankwegu, Amechi S./0000-0003-3561-0514; Cheng, Yu/0000-0002-3676-5799; paerl, hans/0000-0003-2211-1011													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2022	607								127562	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127562		FEB 2022											WOS:000790493000007

In this paper, we investigated the spatial characteristics of the date of the start of the season (SOS), the date of the end of the season (EOS) and the length of the season (LOS) and their change trends from 1982 to 2015 in Northeast China. Our results showed that there was a significant advance of SOS and a significant delay of EOS, especially in the north part of Northeast China. For the average change slope of EOS in the study area, the delay trend was 0.25 d/y, which was more obvious than the advance trend of -0.13 d/y from the SOS. In particular, the LOS of deciduous needleleaf forest (DNF) and grassland increased with a trend of 0.63 d/y and 0.66 d/y from 1982 to 2015, indicating the growth season increased 21.42 and 22.44 days in a 34-year period, respectively. However, few negative signals were detected nearby Hulun Lake, suggesting that the continuous climate warming in the future may bring no longer growing periods for the grass in the semiarid areas as the drought caused by climate warming may limit the vegetation growth.

However, the seasonal process and dynamic mechanism for As mobilization in eutrophic lake remains effectively unknown. Here we innovatively used the planar optodes (PO), high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) combined with fluorescence excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis technologies. We synchronously investigate monthly O-2, As, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM) changes in sediments of Lake Taihu at high resolution in field conditions. We find high As contamination from sediments with 61.88-327.07 mu g m(-2) d(-1) release As fluxes during the algal bloom seasons from May to October 2021. Our results show that an increase in DOM, mainly for humic-like components, resulting in high electron transfer capacity (ETC), promoted the reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides to release As. Partial least square-path modeling (PLS-PM) and random forest modeling analysis identified that Mn oxide reductive dissolution directly accelerated sediments As contamination, which is the crucial factor. Understanding crucial factor controlling As release is especially essential in areas of eutrophic lakes developing effective strategies to manage As-rich eutrophic lake sediments worldwide.

Seasonal inundation dynamics and water balance of the Mara Wetland, Tanzania based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Anthropogenic hydrologic alternations are a threat to flood dependent wetland ecosystems like The Mara Wetland in Tanzania, which plays an important role in regulating the quality, timing and magnitude of the flow of water into Lake Victoria and provides natural resources and habitat for a variety of species. Baseline information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the seasonal inundation is critical to manage potential threats such as dam construction and local climate change, but is challenging to acquire due to the heterogeneity of the landscape caused by the interspersion of open water and emergent vegetation. In this study, intra- and inter-annual inundation pattern of the Mara Wetland are reproduced for 2017-2019 using remotely sensed data. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm is trained bi-seasonally, using eight Sentinel-2 bands, five water- and vegetation-indices and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) to classify the land cover of the wetland region in a semi-automated way, by processing a total of 73 Sentinel-2 scenes based on wet- and dry-state training images for 2017. The scenes are classified into seven classes; three wetland- and four dryland-classes. The overall classification accuracy achieved (based on an independent validation set) is 98.6%. The inundation extents are used in combination with available hydrological field-data to estimate the water balance. The seasonal expansion and contraction of the wetland follows a consistent bi-modal regime, and the results from the water balance affirm the importance of river-flow during the dry-season and local precipitation for the seasonal fluctuations in water-availability.					; Bregoli, Francesco/M-1758-2014; Moges, Michael/HGC-1516-2022; Lhermitte, Stef (Stefaan)/A-3385-2013	Lhermitte, Stef/0000-0002-1622-0177; Kool, Juliette/0000-0002-7592-5767; Bregoli, Francesco/0000-0003-0336-3942; 													1569-8432	1872-826X				MAY	2022	109								102766	10.1016/j.jag.2022.102766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102766		MAY 2022											WOS:000800068700001
J	Gan, M; Lai, XJ; Guo, Y; Chen, YP; Pan, SQ; Zhang, YH				Gan, Min; Lai, Xijun; Guo, Yan; Chen, Yongping; Pan, Shunqi; Zhang, Yinghao			Floodplain Lake Water Level Prediction with Strong River-Lake Interaction Using the Ensemble Learning LightGBM	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												A LightGBM-based water level prediction model was developed for floodplain lakes.The RMSE values of the model's one-day-ahead prediction range from 0.09 to 0.10 m.The rank of the driving factors of Poyang Lake water level change was identified. Timely and accurate prediction of water levels is crucial for managing floodplain lakes with important ecosystem services, especially for flood prevention. Floodplain lakes are hydrologically complex and incredibly variable systems. Their water levels respond nonlinearly to external disturbances, complicating their prediction. Machine learning methods, especially the ensemble learning strategy, provide an excellent choice for solving such nonlinear problems. Based on the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) method, a water level prediction model was developed for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, featuring seasonal flooding and drying under strong river-lake interaction. Daily lake water levels at typical stations and discharge of the Yangtze River and the five main inflowing rivers from 2003 to 2019 were collected for training and testing the proposed model. Combinations of input variables are important for the model performance. The past information of water levels in Poyang Lake can improve the prediction accuracy significantly. Compared with the predictions without considering past water level information, the root mean square error values of the model considering past water levels have decreased from 0.49 to 0.62 m to 0.09-0.10 m for one-day ahead prediction. Therefore, the proposed model with optimized input variables can be an effective tool for the water level prediction of floodplain lakes. Note that the prediction accuracy decreases with the extension of the prediction period. Importance rank analysis shows that the water levels at different typical stations of Poyang Lake have diverse responses to the Yangtze River and the main five inflowing rivers, providing new insights into river-lake interaction. It also implied that the lake regulation should be deliberately conducted for such a large lake with a complex flow regime.

J	Qi, WW; Yang, WT; He, XL; Xu, C				Qi, Wenwen; Yang, Wentao; He, Xiangli; Xu, Chong			Detecting Chamoli landslide precursors in the southern Himalayas using remote sensing data	LANDSLIDES												On 7 February 2021, a catastrophic flood destroyed two hydropower plants, killing at least 150 people in the Himalayan Uttarakhand state of India. This flood was reportedly initiated by a high-position landslide. This work explored the capability of using Sentinel-2 images to diagnose the landslide trigger of this event. There were 264 Sentinel-2 images taken before the landslide, 111 of which are clear. In a pre-landslide Sentinel-2 image, tensile cracks are clearly visible on the landslide head. In the post-landslide image acquired on 10 February 2021, a fresh landslide scarp stripped of snow is visible, indicating that a high-position landslide occurred that may have led to the disaster in the downstream areas. The landslide was initiated at an elevation of similar to 5600 m, slid to the valley floor (similar to 3800 m elevation) and scooped up an unconsolidated mixture of moraine, ice and water that wreaked havoc on local infrastructure. To derive the slope deformation that occurred before the landslide, we selected 15 Sentinel-2 images to compose 10 image pairs. To filter out background noise, we developed a new method to derive reliable slope deformation results. We found that the slope was consistently moving since 2016, after which it moved at least 25 m. We speculated that the slope instability was caused by the seasonal freeze-thaw process. With the impacts of climate warming, more similar hazard chains are expected in the Himalayan region. The regular monitoring of slope stabilities in the Himalayan Mountains and beyond is urgently needed for regional sustainability.					; Xu, Chong/B-6460-2012	He, Xiangli/0000-0002-2863-4457; Xu, Chong/0000-0002-3956-4925													1612-510X	1612-5118				OCT	2021	18	10					3449	3456		10.1007/s10346-021-01753-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-021-01753-y		AUG 2021											WOS:000689669300001

Morphology-based functional groups as effective indicators of phytoplankton dynamics in a tropical cyanobacteria-dominated transitional river-reservoir system	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Cyanobacteria dominance is often associated with economic, ecological and health problems. The potential production of toxic compounds calls for frequent monitoring of cyanobacteria and their toxin production in many aquatic systems. Methods to simplify this process and facilitate management responses to sudden environmental changes are needed to improve the capability of risk-assessment. We tested the effectiveness of two different functional approaches (Functional Groups - FG, Reynolds et al., 2002; and Morphology-Based Functional Groups - MBFG, Kruk et al., 2010) as well as single species and taxonomic classifications as the best proxy of spatio-temporal phytoplankton dynamics and dominance of toxic algae in an impacted transitional river-reservoir system in the tropics. The Paraiba do Sul River and Funil Reservoir are located in one of the most heavily impacted regions of Brazil, and the latter system has a history of intense, long-lasting toxic cyanobacteria blooms. Sampling was conducted over the two climatological periods of the region: warm-rainy (October/2011 and January/2012) and cold-dry (July/2011 and May/2012), with stations in the following areas: tributary, reservoir and river (downstream from the dam). Our results showed that the MBFG classification was the most effective approach, i.e., best explained the response of the phytoplankton community to environmental variations. Environmental factors including light, nutrients, water temperature and hydrology increased the occurrence of different MBFGs on both spatial and temporal scales. The lotic areas showed a more diverse composition of MBFGs, including species with high to moderate tolerance to light limitation and flushing conditions (MBFGs I, III, IV, V and VI). In Funil Reservoir, phytoplankton biovolume was dominated by bloom-forming cyanobacteria (MBFGs III and VII) and remained high throughout the study. This dominance was related to the overall eutrophic conditions, low light availability and increased water column stability of the reservoir. The seasonal dynamics in the reservoir was mainly related to changes in temperature and hydrology. Our results show for the first time that morphology captures efficiently eco-strategies of bloom-forming cyanobacteria and the MBFG approach can be used to predict and monitor the development of cyanobacteria HABs in temporal and spatial scales.

J	Datta, RT; Wouters, B				Datta, Rajashree Tri; Wouters, Bert			Supraglacial lake bathymetry automatically derived from ICESat-2 constraining lake depth estimates from multi-source satellite imagery	CRYOSPHERE												We introduce an algorithm (Watta) which automatically calculates supraglacial lake bathymetry and detects potential ice layers along tracks of the ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite) laser altimeter. Watta uses photon heights estimated by the ICESat-2 ATL03 product and extracts supraglacial lake surface, bottom, and depth corrected for refraction and (sub-)surface ice cover in addition to producing surface heights at the native resolution of the ATL03 photon cloud. These measurements are used to constrain empirical estimates of lake depth from satellite imagery, which were thus far dependent on sparse sets of in situ measurements for calibration. Imagery sources include Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2, and high-resolution Planet Labs PlanetScope and SkySat data, used here for the first time to calculate supraglacial lake depths. The Watta algorithm was developed and tested using a set of 46 lakes near Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn) glacier in western Greenland, and we use multiple imagery sources (available for 45 of these lakes) to assess the use of the red vs. green band to extrapolate depths along a profile to full lake volumes. We use Watta-derived estimates in conjunction with high-resolution imagery from both satellite-based sources (tasked over the season) and nearly simultaneous Operation IceBridge CAMBOT (Continuous Airborne Mapping By Optical Translator) imagery (on a single airborne flight) for a focused study of the drainage of a single lake over the 2019 melt season. Our results suggest that the use of multiple imagery sources (both publicly available and commercial), in combination with altimetry-based depths, can move towards capturing the evolution of supraglacial hydrology at improved spatial and temporal scales.

Satellite microwave assessment of Northern Hemisphere lake ice phenology from 2002 to 2015	CRYOSPHERE												A new automated method enabling consistent satellite assessment of seasonal lake ice phenology at 5 km resolution was developed for all lake pixels (water coverage >= 90 %) in the Northern Hemisphere using 36.5 GHz H-polarized brightness temperature (T-b) observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-E/2) sensors. The lake phenology metrics include seasonal timing and duration of annual ice cover. A moving t test (MTT) algorithm allows for automated lake ice retrievals with daily temporal fidelity and 5 km resolution gridding. The resulting ice phenology record shows strong agreement with available ground-based observations from the Global Lake and River Ice Phenology Database (95.4% temporal agreement) and favorable correlations (R) with alternative ice phenology records from the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (R = 0.84 for water clear of ice (WCI) dates; R = 0.41 for complete freeze over (CFO) dates) and Canadian Ice Service (R = 0.86 for WCI dates; R = 0.69 for CFO dates). Analysis of the resulting 12-year (20022015) AMSR-E/2 ice record indicates increasingly shorter ice cover duration for 43 out of 71 (60.6 %) Northern Hemisphere lakes examined, with significant (p < 0.05) regional trends toward earlier ice melting for only five lakes. Higher-latitude lakes reveal more widespread and larger trends toward shorter ice cover duration than lower-latitude lakes, consistent with enhanced polar warming. This study documents a new satellite-based approach for rapid assessment and regional monitoring of seasonal ice cover changes over large lakes, with resulting accuracy suitable for global change studies.

In all samples the levels of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Fe and Zn were under the maximum allowed concentrations for safe human consumption in Bulgaria and ranged as follows: Cd 0.02-0.05; Cr 0.03-0.06; Cu 0.11-0.20; Mn 0.05-0.71; Ni 0.06-0.11; Pb 0.15-0.27, Fe 1.68-5.86 and Zn 1.94-9.06 mg/kg wet weight. The concentration of As was under detection limit. An assessment of the human risk by calculation of the target hazard quotients (THQ), hazard index (HI) and target risk (TR) was performed. The target hazard quotient (THQ) for individual elements and HI for combined metals were lower than 1, indicating no health risk for consumers due to the intake of either individual or combined metals. The target risk for iAs, Pb and Ni was below 10(-6), indicating no carcinogenic risk. According to these results, the consumption of these freshwater fish species is safe for human health.					; Peycheva, Katya/AAO-9949-2021; Nava, Vincenzo/HHM-3616-2022; Francesco, Fazio/Q-1598-2019; Cicero, Nicola/J-3564-2017; Panayotova, Veselina/N-7059-2017; Merdzhanova, Albena/G-6563-2019; Stancheva, Rositsa/LWJ-6141-2024; Parrino, Vincenzo/O-8408-2019	Merdzhanova, Albena/0000-0002-1209-4847; PARRINO, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8331-212X; Peycheva, Katya/0000-0002-5010-1147; Cicero, Nicola/0000-0002-8055-1915; Panayotova, Veselina/0000-0003-0990-3399; Nava, Vincenzo/0000-0001-5966-4467; Fazio, Francesco/0000-0003-3198-2580; 														2305-6304				NOV	2022	10	11							675	10.3390/toxics10110675	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics10110675								36355966					WOS:000895221100001

Groundwater influences the interlinked hydrological processes and ecological state; however, the function of groundwater in the ecohydrological system is yet to be quantified clearly. In this study, we assess the role of groundwater in the ecohydrological system of the Heihe River Basin, using a regional-scale integrated model with multiple independent databases. Our results show that first, in over 40% of mid-lower plain, the groundwater table is less than 10m deep, and both recharge and evaporation of groundwater dominate seasonal water budget variations; recharge is more affected by land use than groundwater evaporation, and it has a higher variability ranging over 2 orders of magnitude within vegetated land use type. Second, mountain block recharge maintains the piedmont groundwater; the upper mountainous partition between baseflow and mountain block recharge impacts the evaporation and two-way exchange between groundwater and stream/lake in the downstream alluvial plain. Third, the groundwater system stores over 50% of streamflow in the dry season and about 10% in the wet season along leakage segments; groundwater dominates the streams by contributing about 40% of streamflow in the dry season along the seepage segments of the middle alluvial plain. Fourth, shallow groundwater sustains a vibrant ecosystem directly by providing a stable source of water for vegetation and indirectly by buffering lateral groundwater flow. Our study not only bridges the quantification gap for regional studies of drylands but also provides suggestions on water management and future water sustainability and food security.

We investigated the hydrological processes of Lake Qinghai and the surrounding watershed that have influenced water level and lake area from 1956 to 2019. Relationships among water level, climate change and human activities were also assessed. Water level and lake area were positively correlated with precipitation and runoff into the lake, and negatively correlated with evaporation. Climate change factors including precipitation and runoff were the primary causes of lake level change, whereas human activities, including variation in a human footprint index, land use, and grassland irrigation, were secondary factors. A time series model forecasted that from 2020 to 2050 water levels will increase further by 2.45 m. Although this increase in water level may have some benefits, such as reduced local desertification, the expansion of lake area will continue to flood low beaches, pasture lands, near shore infrastructure and roads, and impact tourism locations. However, continued water level rise may also have negative ecological effects, such as reduce habitat of seasonal birds and reduced water quality due to erosion and sediment resuspension in shallow nearshore lake areas. Local stakeholders, government authorities, and scientists should give greater attention to anticipated changes in water level, and further ecological studies and infrastructure adaptation measures should be implemented.					zhang, xiaonan/IUN-3893-2023; Weidman, R/D-3253-2011; Li, Huayu/KMX-1704-2024; Weidman, Paul/D-3253-2011; Hou, PengFei/C-4123-2018	Weidman, Paul/0000-0002-3742-8620; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 1	2023	333								117461	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117461		FEB 2023						36773477					WOS:000944658400001

Satellite-based estimates of surface water dynamics in the Congo River Basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In the Congo River Basin (CRB), due to the lack of contemporary in situ observations, there is a limited understanding of the large-scale variability of its present-day hydrologic components and their link with climate. In this context, remote sensing observations provide a unique opportunity to better characterize those dynamics. Analyzing the Global Inundation Extent Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) time series, we first show that surface water extent (SWE) exhibits marked seasonal patterns, well distributed along the major rivers and their tributaries, and with two annual maxima located: i) in the lakes region of the Lwalaba sub-basin and ii) in the "Cuvette Centrale", including Tumba and Mai-Ndombe Lakes. At an interannual time scale, we show that SWE variability is influenced by ENSO and the Indian Ocean dipole events. We then estimate water level maps and surface water storage (SWS) in floodplains, lakes, rivers and wetlands of the CRB, over the period 2003-2007, using a multi satellite approach, which combines the GIEMS dataset with the water level measurements derived from the ENVISAT altimeter heights. The mean annual variation in SWS in the CRB is 81 +/- 24 km(3) and contributes to 19 +/- 5% of the annual variations of GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (33 +/- 7% in the Middle Congo). It represents also similar to 6 +/- 2% of the annual water volume that flows from the Congo River into the Atlantic Ocean.

Carbonate facies-specific stable isotope data record climate, hydrology, and microbial communities in Great Salt Lake, UT	GEOBIOLOGY												Organic and inorganic stable isotopes of lacustrine carbonate sediments are commonly used in reconstructions of ancient terrestrial ecosystems and environments. Microbial activity and local hydrological inputs can alter porewater chemistry (e.g., pH, alkalinity) and isotopic composition (e.g., delta O-18(water), delta C-13(DIC)), which in turn has the potential to impact the stable isotopic compositions recorded and preserved in lithified carbonate. The fingerprint these syngenetic processes have on lacustrine carbonate facies is yet unknown, however, and thus, reconstructions based on stable isotopes may misinterpret diagenetic records as broader climate signals. Here, we characterize geochemical and stable isotopic variability of carbonate minerals, organic matter, and water within one modern lake that has known microbial influences (e.g., microbial mats and microbialite carbonate) and combine these data with the context provided by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing community profiles. Specifically, we measure oxygen, carbon, and clumped isotopic compositions of carbonate sediments (delta O-18(carb), delta C-13(carb), increment (47)), as well as carbon isotopic compositions of bulk organic matter (delta C-13(org)) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; delta C-13(DIC)) of lake and porewater in Great Salt Lake, Utah from five sites and three seasons. We find that facies equivalent to ooid grainstones provide time-averaged records of lake chemistry that reflect minimal alteration by microbial activity, whereas microbialite, intraclasts, and carbonate mud show greater alteration by local microbial influence and hydrology. Further, we find at least one occurrence of increment (47) isotopic disequilibrium likely driven by local microbial metabolism during authigenic carbonate precipitation. The remainder of the carbonate materials (primarily ooids, grain coatings, mud, and intraclasts) yield clumped isotope temperatures (T( increment (47))), delta O-18(carb), and calculated delta O-18(water) in isotopic equilibrium with ambient water and temperature at the time and site of carbonate precipitation. Our findings suggest that it is possible and necessary to leverage diverse carbonate facies across one sedimentary horizon to reconstruct regional hydroclimate and evaporation-precipitation balance, as well as identify microbially mediated carbonate formation.					; Ingalls, Miquela/AAJ-2645-2020	SNELL, KATHRYN/0000-0001-5373-7143; Trower, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9898-5589; Frantz, Carie/0000-0003-2544-9245; Ingalls, Miquela/0000-0002-7451-2944													1472-4677	1472-4669				SEP	2020	18	5					566	593		10.1111/gbi.12386	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12386		MAR 2020						32196875					WOS:000520857900001

Exploring nutrient and light limitation of algal production in a shallow turbid reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Harmful algal blooms are increasingly recognized as a threat to the integrity of freshwater reservoirs, which serve as water supplies, wildlife habitats, and recreational attractions. While algal growth and accumulation is controlled by many environmental factors, the relative importance of these factors is unclear, particularly for turbid eutrophic systems. Here we develop and compare two models that test the relative importance of vertical mixing, light, and nutrients for explaining chlorophyll-a variability in shallow (2-3 m) embayments of a eutrophic reservoir, Jordan Lake, North Carolina. One is a multiple linear regression (statistical) model and the other is a process-based (mechanistic) model. Both models are calibrated using a 15-year data record of chlorophyll-a concentration (2003-2018) for the seasonal period of cyanobacteria dominance (June-October). The mechanistic model includes a novel represen-tation of vertical mixing and is calibrated in a Bayesian framework, which allows for data-driven inference of important process rates. Both models show that chlorophyll-a concentration is much more responsive to nutrient variability than mixing, light, or temperature. While both models explain approximately 60% of the variability in chlorophyll-a, the mechanistic model is more robust in cross-validation and provides a more comprehensive assessment of algal drivers. Overall, these models indicate that nutrient reductions, rather than changes in mixing or background turbidity, are critical to controlling cyanobacteria in a shallow eutrophic freshwater system.

Geographic and temporal variations in turbulent heat loss from lakes: A global analysis across 45 lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Heat fluxes at the lake surface play an integral part in determining the energy budget and thermal structure in lakes, including regulating how lakes respond to climate change. We explore patterns in turbulent heat fluxes, which vary across temporal and spatial scales, using in situ high-frequency monitoring data from 45 globally distributed lakes. Our analysis demonstrates that some of the lakes studied follow a marked seasonal cycle in their turbulent surface fluxes and that turbulent heat loss is highest in larger lakes and those situated at low latitude. The Bowen ratio, which is the ratio of mean sensible to mean latent heat fluxes, is smaller at low latitudes and, in turn, the relative contribution of evaporative to total turbulent heat loss increases toward the tropics. Latent heat transfer ranged from similar to 60% to > 90% of total turbulent heat loss in the examined lakes. The Bowen ratio ranged from 0.04 to 0.69 and correlated significantly with latitude. The relative contributions to total turbulent heat loss therefore differ among lakes, and these contributions are influenced greatly by lake location. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of lakes in the climate system, effects on the lake water balance, and temperature-dependent processes in lakes.

The results show that the abundance of MPs during the rainy season reached 545.5 particles m(-3), which was 1.85-fold higher than during the dry season. The spatial distribution of MPs also varied offshore in the following order: the river > estuary > sea. The average abundance of MPs in the river was 1.17-fold higher than that of the estuary and 4.65-fold higher than that of the marine environment. There were large amounts of gray, white, and green MPs, and about 53.5-73.9% of the MPs were less than 0.5 mm. The main forms of MPs were fibers, granules, fragments, and films. MPs composed of polyethylene accounted for 35.7-38.8%. PCA analysis showed that MPs carried by the river were an important source of MP pollution in the coastal waters.

This study employs both individual and hybridbased techniques to boost the accuracy of dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll -a (Chl-a) predictions in the Wadi Dayqah Dam located in Oman. At first, an AAQ-RINKO device (CTD + sensor) was used to collect water quality parameters from different locations and varying depths in the reservoir. Second, the dataset is segmented into homogeneous clusters based on DO and Chl-a parameters by leveraging an optimized K -means algorithm, facilitating precise estimations. Third, ten sophisticated variational -individual data -driven models, namely generalized regression neural network (GRNN), random forest (RF), gaussian process regression (GPR), decision tree (DT), least -squares boosting (LSB), bayesian ridge (BR), support vector regression (SVR), K -nearest neighbors (KNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and group method of data handling (GMDH) are employed to estimate DO and Chl-a concentrations. Fourth, to improve prediction accuracy, bayesian model averaging (BMA), entropy weighted (EW), and a new enhanced clustering -based hybrid technique called Entropy-ORNESS are employed to combine model outputs. The Entropy-ORNESS method incorporates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine optimal weights and then combine them with EW weights. Finally, the inclusion of bootstrapping techniques introduces a stochastic assessment of model uncertainty, resulting in a robust estimator model. In the validation phase, the Entropy-ORNESS technique outperforms the independent models among the three fusion -based methods, yielding R 2 values of 0.92 and 0.89 for DO and Chl-a clusters, respectively. The proposed hybridbased methodology demonstrates reduced uncertainty compared to single data -driven models and two combination frameworks, with uncertainty levels of 0.24% and 1.16% for cluster 1 of DO and cluster 2 of Chl-a parameters. As a highlight point, the spatial analysis of DO and Chl-a concentrations exhibit similar pattern variations across varying depths of the dam according to the comparison of field measurements with the best hybrid technique, in which DO concentration values notably decrease during warmer seasons. These findings collectively underscore the potential of the upgraded weighted -based hybrid approach to provide more accurate estimations of DO and Chl-a concentrations in dynamic aquatic environments.

In order to examine the recovery efficiency of fish faunas, we compared the changes in multidimensional (alpha and beta) diversity in the Shengjin Lake between pen-culture stage (PS) and recovery stage (RS). Our results demonstrated significant variations in fish community composition, with distinct populational restoration in wild species of high trophic level and river-lake migratory species. The higher abundance of wild and migratory species in RS implied the enhanced dispersal and exchange process of fish individuals with the elimination of net pens. Despite significant variations of community composition, the alpha and beta diversity indices exhibited non-significant change between PS and RS. However, our study still revealed the recovery of natural seasonal community dynamics, since there were significant variations of both alpha and beta di-versity between high-water (HW) and low-water (LW) seasons in RS. The significant higher alpha diversity (S, d, H & PRIME;) in HW indicated flooding induced fish supplements in floodplain lakes, due to the well-developed breeding sites, nurseries and refuges provided by floodplain lakes. Meanwhile, the significant lower beta SOR and beta SIM in HW implied the homogenized communities during flooding seasons, which can be ascribed to better hydrological connec-tivity of various habitats and more even distribution of fish faunas triggered by flood pulses. The reappearance of natural seasonal variations in multidimensional (alpha and beta) diversity indicate the initial recovery of fish faunas. There is a pressing need for prolonged surveillance to explore the recovery mechanism of fish assemblage. Meanwhile, our results also highlight the importance of conserving the lacustrine connectivity and seasonal flooding for the recovery of fishery resources in the floodplain lakes.					xie, chang/GYJ-2493-2022; Dai, Bingguo/AAM-7257-2021; Wu, Jiajun/AAM-6936-2021	Dai, Bingguo/0000-0003-4935-2800; Jiang, Zhongguan/0000-0002-5949-6106													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 1	2022	319								115743	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115743		JUL 2022						35842994					WOS:000831076200009

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Using long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite observations, the inundation changes of Tonle Sap Lake between 1988 and 2018 were investigated. The results show that the inundation area was stable before 2000, followed by a significant shrinking trend between 2000 and 2018. Quantitative remote sensing retrievals for concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) also demonstrate an evident increasing trend (7.92 mg l(-1)yr(-1)) since 2000. A strong correlation (R-2= 0.67) was found between the annual mean inundation area and concurrent precipitation in a region located in the lower basin of the Mekong River (mostly outside the drainage basin of Tonle Sap Lake). A multiple general linear model (GLM) regression further pointed to the precipitation variation as a major contributor (76.1%) to the interannual fluctuation of the inundation area, while the dams constructed in China only contributed to 6.9%. The limited impacts of Chinese dams on the inundation area of the lake could be revealed through the limited fraction of water discharge from the Mekong River within China (similar to 17%). The analysis also found significant impacts of inundation changes on the recent lake turbidity increase in the dry seasons. We clearly revealed that the contribution of dam construction in China to the recent lake shrinkage was insignificant when compared with the impacts of the precipitation decrease. The results of this study provide important scientific evidence for settling water volume-related transboundary disputes regarding the control of the inundation area and water turbidity of Tonle Sap Lake.

Here, we quantified CO2 and CH4 fluxes from a set of temporary ponds across seasons. The ponds were in all occasion net CO2 emitters irrespective of the presence or absence of water. While the CO2 fluxes were in the upper range of emissions for freshwater lentic systems, CH4 fluxes were mostly undetectable. Dry habitats substantially contributed to these emissions and were always a source of CO2, whereas inundated habitats acted either as a source or a sink of atmospheric CO2 along the year. Higher concentrations of coloured and humic organic matter in water and sediment were linked to higher CO2 emissions. Composition of the sediment microbial community was related both to dissolved organic matter concentration and composition, but we did not find a direct link with CO2 fluxes. The presence of methanogenic archaea in most ponds suggested the potential for episodic CH4 production and emission. Our results highlight the need for spatially and temporally inclusive approaches that consider the dry phases and habitats to characterize carbon cycling in temporary systems.

Denitrification across landscapes and waterscapes:: A synthesis	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Denitrification is a critical process regulating the removal of bioavailable nitrogen (N) from natural and human-altered systems. While it has been extensively studied in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, there has been limited communication among denitrification scientists working in these individual systems. Here, we compare rates of denitrification and controlling factors across a range of ecosystem types. We suggest that terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems in which denitrification occurs can be organized along a continuum ranging from (1) those in which nitrification and denitrification are tightly coupled in space and time to (2) those in which nitrate production and denitrification are relatively decoupled. In aquatic ecosystems, N inputs influence denitrification rates whereas hydrology and geomorphology influence the proportion of N inputs that are denitrified. Relationships between denitrification and water residence time and N load are remarkably similar across lakes, river reaches, estuaries, and continental shelves. Spatially distributed global models of denitrification suggest that continental shelf sediments account for the largest portion (44%) of total global denitrification, followed by terrestrial soils (22%) and oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs; 14%). Freshwater systems (groundwater, lakes, rivers) account for about 20% and estuaries 1% of total global denitrification. Denitrification of land-based N sources is distributed somewhat differently. Within. watersheds, the amount of land-based N denitrified is generally highest in terrestrial soils, with progressively smaller amounts denitrified in groundwater, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and estuaries. A number of regional exceptions to this general trend of decreasing denitrification in a downstream direction exist, including significant denitrification in continental shelves of N from terrestrial sources. Though terrestrial soils and groundwater are responsible for much denitrification at the watershed scale, per-area denitrification rates in soils and groundwater (kg N.km(-2).yr(-1)) are, on average, approximately one-tenth the per-area rates of denitrification in lakes, rivers, estuaries, continental shelves, or OMZs. A number of potential approaches to increase denitrification on the landscape, and thus decrease N export to sensitive coastal systems exist. However, these have not generally been widely tested for their effectiveness at scales required to significantly reduce N export at the whole watershed scale.

It is a prominent source of domestic water supply, irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectric power generation. Therefore, this investigation focused on regional- to global-scale applications. We revealed the empirical links between chlorophyll (Chl-a) and total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), the impact of the monsoon regime on nutrients, and flood and drought regime. Further, we investigated the trophic status dynamics, tendencies of water chemistry factors, and valuation of zonal water chemistry by the application of a modified multimetric water pollution index (WPI). The physicochemical indicators illustrated significant disparities among the Lacustrine (Lz), Transition (Tz), and Riverine (Rz) zones. The solid contents (TSS) displayed a significant increase in the lake zones in the order of Lz (4.58 +/- 13.7 mg/L), Tz (6.16 +/- 16.2 mg/L), and Rz (7.38 +/- 18.9 mg/L). However, TP and allied chemical species revealed an inverse relationship with the TN:TP ambient ratios. Nevertheless, Chl-a displayed sharp interzonal fluctuations from the Lz (2.90 +/- 3.29 mu g/L) to Tz (4.61 +/- 4.98 mu g/L). The seasonal deviations, however, exposed divergent heterogeneities among the TSS, TN, TP, and Chl-a. The regression plot between the observed and predicted Chl-a in the Soyang reservoir displayed a very strong relationship (R-2 = 0.997). The seasonal and interannual variations of trophic status displayed a higher impact of precipitation, particularly in the case of TP and Chl-a. The flood years indicated phosphorus limitations, while drought years alluded to the non-algal light limitations (biogenic turbidity). Water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), TSS, TP, and Chl-a displayed decreasing trends in the ambient water. In contrast, pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC), and TN displayed increasing tendencies by the application Mann-Kendall trend analysis. The WPI outcomes designated Lz with excellent water quality while Tz an Rz indicated good water quality. It also indicated impending sedimentation tendencies in the Rz. In conclusion, our findings indicated fluctuating rainfall patterns (drought and flood conditions) that significantly impacted the Soyang reservoir water quality, flood and drought severity, and trophic status of the reservoir. This study highlights the requirements of further studies to substantiate the drought and flood dynamics and their impacts on nutrients and overall water quality status.

A case study using astronomical tuning from 42.2 to 45.4 Ma in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												As a typical sedimentary structure in fine-grained rocks, laminae are widely distributed in shales and mudstones in sedimentary basins. The Shahejie Formation (42.2-45.4 Ma) formed during the Eocene of the Paleogene in the Dongying Depression of China is recognized as a typical area to study lacustrine shale. According to the composition of different lamina, four types of couplets are identified, including carbonate-clay couplets, carbonate-organic couplets, clay-organic couplets and carbonate-clay-organic triplets. All couplets are composed of light and dark layers. A combination of core images, microscopic observations, mineral compositions, geochemical data, carbon and oxygen isotopes, and strontium isotopes verifies that the laminae are primarily developed in a saline and anoxic, or even euxinic environment, with a high organic matter (OM) flux. Through astronomical cycle analysis of the natural gamma ray (GR) curve from sample site well NY1, the data suggest that the lacustrine shale laminae are formed annually with an average duration of 1.34 yr. The formation of laminae is affected by the season, which is closely related to the seasonal growth and death of algae. During the period of algae growth, a large number of light-colored carbonate laminae are deposited, whereas when the algae dies, organic matter accumulates at the bottom of lakes and forms dark organic-rich laminae. The interbedded and lenticular laminae, which are subdivided by layering characteristics, are primarily affected by diagenesis in postdepositional processes. Study of the laminae is helpful in understanding the formation process of lacustrine shale, and it provides invaluable sources of information for paleoclimate reconstruction.					du, xuebin/R-6873-2019	Zhao, Ke/0000-0002-8121-4611													0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 15	2019	528						35	49		10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.04.034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.04.034													WOS:000472123900003

These problems are linked to the urban and industrial wastes, natural geologic conditions, and mining activities carried out upstream of the Katari Basin, where rivers discharge into the Cohana Bay. A total of 37 water samples were collected during wet season, 31 groundwater samples including drinking water wells and six surface water samples. The hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied to hydrochemical data. Results show high salinity in groundwater related to the evaporation causing serious problems for the groundwater quality and rendering it unsuitable for drinking. Dissolved As concentration ranges from 0.7 to 89.7 mu g/L; the principal source of As could be the alteration of volcanic rocks, more than 48% of the shallow groundwater samples exceeded the WHO guideline value for As and more than 22% for NO3-. Groundwater has neutral to slightly alkaline pH, and moderately oxidizing character. The groundwater chemistry reveals considerable variability, ranging from Na-SO4,Cl type through mixed Na-HCO3 type and Ca,Na-HCO3,Cl type. The distribution of trace elements shows a large range of concentrations. Speciation of As indicates that the predominant oxidation state is As (V). The geochemical modelling indicates that As could be associated with iron oxides and hydroxides which are probably the most important mineral phases for the As adsorption. The spatial distribution and the variation of dissolved As concentration in groundwater is governed by the variability in geological characteristics of the region that raises a significant concern about drinking water quality.					; Sracek, Ondra/AAK-4593-2020	Ormachea Munoz, Mauricio/0000-0001-8245-1697; Sracek, Ondra/0000-0002-3085-6358													2352-801X					APR	2019	8						281	293		10.1016/j.gsd.2018.11.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2018.11.013													WOS:000694739900027

Reconstructing grassland fire history using sedimentary charcoal: Considering count, size and shape	PLOS ONE												Fire is a key Earth system process, with 80% of annual fire activity taking place in grassland areas. However, past fire regimes in grassland systems have been difficult to quantify due to challenges in interpreting the charcoal signal in depositional environments. To improve reconstructions of grassland fire regimes, it is essential to assess two key traits: (1) charcoal count, and (2) charcoal shape. In this study, we quantified the number of charcoal pieces in 51 sediment samples of ponds in the Great Plains and tested its relevance as a proxy for the fire regime by examining 13 potential factors influencing charcoal count, including various fire regime components (e.g. the fire frequency, the area burned, and the fire season), vegetation cover and pollen assemblages, and climate variables. We also quantified the width to length (W: L) ratio of charcoal particles, to assess its utility as a proxy of fuel types in grassland environments by direct comparison with vegetation cover and pollen assemblages. Our first conclusion is that charcoal particles produced by grassland fires are smaller than those produced by forest fires. Thus, a mesh size of 120 mu m as used in forested environments is too large for grassland ecosystems. We recommend counting all charcoal particles over 60 mu m in grasslands and mixed grass-forest environments to increase the number of samples with useful data. Second, a W: L ratio of 0.5 or smaller appears to be an indicator for fuel types, when vegetation surrounding the site is before composed of at least 40% grassland vegetation. Third, the area burned within 1060m of the depositional environments explained both the count and the area of charcoal particles. Therefore, changes in charcoal count or charcoal area through time indicate a change in area burned. The fire regimes of grassland systems, including both human and climatic influences on fire behavior, can be characterized by long-term charcoal records.

A comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of four ML methods: random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), deep neural network (DNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The LSTM-based model is selected as the optimal predictive model of TP concentration in Euiam Lake (E_TP) on seasons (May to October) with high rainfall and inflow from two upstream dams (Chuncheon Dam and Soyanggang Dam). We also perform a gradient-based analysis to figure out the most influential factors on E_TP using the LSTM model. The top four priority factors are TP concentrations and suspended solids concentrations in the upstream dams. This application of the gradient-based analysis enables the predictive model to discuss quantitative reductions in the priorities. Based on these numerical results, we anticipate that the proposed framework can enhance the feasibility of management practices for achieving the water quality management goal of the study region. New hydrological insights: This study demonstrates that a robust predictive model can be developed for a serial impoundment system with distinct seasonal characteristics of rainfall, temperature, and water quality, thereby facilitating the selection of management priorities. Based on the predictive model results, we conclude that it is the key for managing the target TP concentration to prioritize the incoming TP concentrations and determine the quantitative					Min, Baehyun/AAC-4606-2021; Kim, Min/ABG-7091-2020	Son, Hee Won/0000-0001-9123-7422														2214-5818				JUN	2022	41								101069	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101069		APR 2022											WOS:000793667700002

In this study, we investigated the temporal variations of the prokaryotic community in six lakes with different salinity by using Illumina sequencing. The results showed that prokaryotic community compositions exhibited temporal variations in all studied lakes, which may be partially caused by temporal fluctuations of environmental variables (e.g. salinity, temperature, total nitrogen). Salinity fluctuations exhibited stronger influences on temporal variations of prokaryotic community composition in the lakes with low salinity than in those with high salinity. Stochastic factors (i.e. neutral processes) also contributed to temporal variations of prokaryotic community composition, and their contributions decreased with increasing salinity in the studied saline lakes. Network analysis showed that prokaryotic co-occurrence networks of the studied lakes exhibited non-random topology. Salinity affected the phylogenetic composition of nodes in the studied networks. The topological features (e.g. average connectivity and modularity) of the studied networks significantly differed between lake waters and sediments. Collectively, these results expand our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying prokaryotic community assembly and co-occurrence relationships in saline lakes with different salinity.					han, mingxian/AAP-3891-2021; Yang, Jian/LWI-5747-2024; Jiang, Hongchen/Y-9471-2018; Sun, Xiaoxi/AGU-7494-2022; Wang, Beichen/GPT-1709-2022	Jiang, Hongchen/0000-0003-1271-7028; Yang, Jian/0000-0003-4019-3671; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				JAN	2021	97	1							fiaa234	10.1093/femsec/fiaa234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiaa234								33206972					WOS:000608416600014

The occurrence and ecological risk of 34 PPCPs classified as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), cardiovascular drugs, psychotropic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, psychostimulants, and pesticides during rainstormperiod in surface water of the Dongting Lake, China, were studied. Twenty-six out of thirty-four PPCPs were detected, and the total concentrations of antibiotics ranged from 0.15 to 214.75 ng L-1 in surface water. The highest average concentration was observed for diclofenac, followed by diethyltoluamide (DEET). The PPCP concentrations were much lower in Dongting Lake compared to other rivers and lakes due to the strong dilution effect of rainstorm, while the detection rate remains high. Caffeine and DEET were detected with 100% frequency in Dongting Lake, and the detection rates of diclofenac, mefenamic acid, and roxithromycin were above 90%. The pollution levels of antibiotics decreased in the order of East Dongting Lake > South Dongting Lake > West Dongting Lake, which may be related to the distribution of aquaculture plants, sewage treatment plants, and population density. The risk quotient (RQ) method was used to evaluate ecological environment risk under the worst case and the results suggested that clarithromycin, diclofenac, roxithromycin, and erythromycin might pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake, especially clarithromycin. This study can provide data support for further research on the dilutive effect and mechanism of rainwater runoff on PPCPs in lakes on a large scale.

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying the spatial assembly process of both abundant and rare bacterial taxa has become a central goal in microbial ecology. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to explore geographic patterns and the relative importance of ecological processes in the assembly of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities from 25 lakes across the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River basin (MLYB), located in Southeast China, where most of the lakes are interconnected by river networks. We found similar biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare subcommunities which could significantly distinguish the community compositions of the two lake groups that were far from each other but which could not distinguish the community compositions of the nearby lakes. Both abundant and rare bacteria followed a strong distance-decay relationship. These findings suggest that the interconnectivity between lakes homogenizes the bacterial communities in local areas, and the abundant and rare taxa therein may be affected by the same ecological process. In addition, based on the measured environmental variables, the deterministic processes explain a small fraction of variation within both abundant and rare subcommunities, while both neutral and null models revealed a high stochasticity ratio for the spatial distribution patterns of both abundant and rare taxa. These findings indicate that the stochastic processes exhibited a greater influence on both abundant and rare bacterial subcommunity assemblies among interconnected lakes. IMPORTANCE The middle and lower Yangtze Plain is a typical floodplain in which many lakes connect with each other, especially in the wet season. More importantly, with the frequent change of regional water level in the wet season, there is a mutual hydrodynamic exchange among these lakes. The microbial biogeography among these interconnected lakes is still poorly understood. This study aims to unravel the mechanisms underlying the assembly process of abundant and rare bacteria among the interconnected lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze Plain. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of the biogeographic patterns of rare and abundant bacterial taxa and their determined processes among interconnected aquatic habitats.					; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021; Yu, Haijun/C-5343-2016; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021	Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2020	86	6							e02423-19	10.1128/AEM.02423-19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02423-19								31924617					WOS:000522978600006

The effect of metabarcoding 18S rRNA region choice on diversity of microeukaryotes including phytoplankton	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Metabarcoding using high throughput sequencing of amplicons of the 18S rRNA gene is one of the widely used methods for assessing the diversity of microeukaryotes in various ecosystems. We investigated the effectiveness of the V4 and V8-V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene by comparing the results of metabarcoding microeukaryotic communities using the DADA2 (ASV), USEARCH-UNOISE3 (ZOTU), and USEARCH-UPARSE (OTU with 97% similarity) algorithms. Both regions showed similar levels of genetic variability and taxa identification accuracy. Richness for DADA2 datasets of both regions was lower than for UNOISE3 and UPARSE datasets, which is due to more accurate error correction in amplicons. Microeukaryotic communities (autotrophs and heterotrophs) structure identified using both regions showed a significant relationship with phytoplankton (autotrophs) communities structure based on microscopy in a seasonal freshwater sample series. The strongest relationship was found between the phytoplankton species and V8-V9 ASVs produced by DADA2.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of PFAS in the water and sediment of Taihu Lake, incorporating both nontarget and target screening, seasonal and geographical variation analysis, and risk prioritization. A total of 58 PFAS from 13 classes were identified, revealing complex PFAS contamination. In addition to short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and sulfonates (PFSAs), bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Ntf2) and perfluoro-2,5-dimethyl-3,6-dioxo-heptanoic acid (C7 HFPO-TA) exhibited relatively high concentrations in water, with median values of 21.7 and 5.72 ng/L, respectively. Seasonal and geographical variation analysis revealed elevated levels of C7 HFPO-TA, Ntf2, and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in the northeastern areas, suggesting transport via water diversion project. Multicriteria risk prioritization identified four high priority PFAS (Ntf2, C7 HFPO-TA, PFHxA, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) in water and two high priority PFAS (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) and PFHxA) in sediment. Overall, this study revealed Ntf2 and C7 HFPO-TA as priority PFAS in Taihu Lake, underscoring the urgent necessity of evaluating risks associated with these emerging PFAS.					; Dai, Jiayin/GVU-3230-2022	Pan, Yitao/0000-0001-6496-8174; zhang, Frank/0009-0003-4999-4368; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 11	2024	58	42					18980	18991		10.1021/acs.est.4c06731	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c06731		OCT 2024						39391926					WOS:001337358500001

Present study analyses the spatio-temporal variations in fish diversity, distribution and assemblage structure, across a permanently-built saltwater barrage in Vembanad Lake, a tropical estuary along the southwest coast of India. A barrage constructed in the middle part of the Lake in 1975, and its unscientific management over the last 45 years has hydrologically transformed the estuary into three distinct zones with distinct salinity regimes (an upper freshwater estuary, middle estuary on either side of the barrage, and a predominantly saline lower estuary). Monthly sampling was carried out in each zone from June 2015 to May 2016, representing three seasons, i.e. monsoon, post-monsoon and premonsoon. Fish diversity in the estuary is currently represented by 90 species belonging to 17 orders and 48 families, a 40% reduction since the 1980s. Two distinct fish assemblage were recorded on either side of the barrage indicating a lack of, or reduced habitat connectivity, with greater species diversity observed in the middle estuary. The spatial and temporal distribution of fish in the estuary was influenced primarily by salinity. Most marine species recorded prior to construction of the barrage has now disappeared and are replaced by freshwater and estuarine species. Since saline stretch of the estuary has reduced considerably due to hydrological modification, most migratory species are trapped near the barrage and caught in local fisheries. Adaptive management strategies to reduce impact of the barrage is urgently required to ensure a sustainable future for the biodiversity of this Ramsar site. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, high-frequency remote sensing data are needed for surface water mapping. Dongting Lake, the second-largest freshwater lake in China, is famous for the seasonal fluctuations of its inundation extents in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It is also greatly affected by the Three Gorges Project. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 data to generate surface water maps of Dongting Lake at 10 m resolution. First, we generated the Sentinel-1 time series backscattering coefficient for VH and VV polarizations at 10 m resolution by using a monthly composition method. Second, we generated the thresholds for mapping surface water at 10 m resolution with monthly frequencies using Sentinel-1 data. Then, we derived the monthly surface water distribution product of Dongting Lake in 2016, and finally, we analyzed the inner-annual surface water dynamics. The results showed that: (1) The thresholds were -21.56 and -15.82 dB for the backscattering coefficients for VH and VV, respectively, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were above 95.50% and 0.90, respectively, for the VH backscattering coefficient, and above 94.50% and 0.88, respectively, for the VV backscattering coefficient. The VV backscattering coefficient achieved lower accuracy due to the effect of the wind causing roughness on the surface of the water. (2) The maximum and minimum areas of surface water were 2040.33 km(2) in July, and 738.89 km(2) in December. The surface water area of Dongting Lake varied most significantly in April and August. The permanent water acreage in 2016 was 556.35 km(2), accounting for 19.65% of the total area of Dongting Lake, and the acreage of seasonal water was 1525.21 km(2). This study proposed a method to automatically generate monthly surface water at 10 m resolution, which may contribute to monitoring surface water in a timely manner.

Effects of lake warming on the seasonal risk of toxic cyanobacteria exposure	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Incidence of elevated harmful algal blooms and concentrations of microcystin are increasing globally as a result of human-mediated changes in land use and climate. However, few studies document changes in the seasonal and interannual concentrations of microcystin in lakes. Here, we modeled 11 yr of biweekly microcystin data from six lakes to characterize the seasonal patterns in microcystin concentration and to ascertain if there were pronounced changes in the patterns of potential human exposure to microcystin in lakes of central North America. Bayesian time series analysis with generalized additive models found evidence for a regional increase in microcystin maxima and duration but recorded high variation among lakes. During the past decade, warmer temperatures, but not nutrient levels, led to a marked increase in the number of days when concentrations exceeded drinking and recreational water thresholds set by the World Health Organization and United States Environmental Protection Agency.

The Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR): integration of water isotopes in watershed observation and riverine research	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												We introduce a new online global database of riverine water stable isotopes (Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers, GNIR) and evaluate its longer-term data holdings. Overall, 218 GNIR river stations were clustered into three different groups based on the seasonal variation in their isotopic composition, which was closely coupled to precipitation and snowmelt water runoff regimes. Sinusoidal fit functions revealed phases within each grouping and deviations from the sinusoidal functions revealed important river alterations or hydrological processes in these watersheds. The seasonal isotopic amplitude of delta O-18 in rivers averaged 2.5 parts per thousand, and did not increase as a function of latitude, like it does for global precipitation. Low seasonal isotopic amplitudes in rivers suggest the prevalence of mixing and storage such as occurs via lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater. The application of a catchment-constrained regionalized cluster-based water isotope prediction model (CC-RCWIP) allowed for direct comparison between the expected isotopic compositions for the upstream catchment precipitation with the measured isotopic composition of river discharge at observation stations. The catchment-constrained model revealed a strong global isotopic correlation between average rainfall and river discharge (R-2 = 0.88) and the study demonstrated that the seasonal isotopic composition and variation of river water can be predicted. Deviations in data from model-predicted values suggest there are important natural or anthropogenic catchment processes like evaporation, damming, and water storage in the upstream catchment.					; Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013; aggarwal, pradeep/C-8367-2016	Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771; Halder, Janine/0000-0003-3390-886X													1027-5606	1607-7938					2015	19	8					3419	3431		10.5194/hess-19-3419-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-3419-2015													WOS:000360653600006
J	Raudsepp, A				Raudsepp, Anu			Bishop Platon's role in leading the spiritual resistance of orthodox Estonians during the German occupation in 1918	AJALOOLINE AJAKIRI-THE ESTONIAN HISTORICAL JOURNAL												At the start of the 20th century, the church strongly influenced the value judgements and the world of thoughts and ideas of people in our region. Primarily two confessions, the Lutheran and Orthodox faiths, have to be considered in the Estonian context. Starting from the Reformation that took place in the 16th century, the Lutheran faith prevailed in Estonia. Baltic Germans and most Estonians belonged to this confession. The Orthodox faith rose to the agenda only in connection with the extensive religious conversion movement of the 1840s. The Riga Vicar Diocese (covering the governorates of Livland and Courland) was established in 1836 as part of the Pskov Diocese and became an independent diocese in 1850. The Governorate of Estland was part of the St Petersburg Diocese until 1865. Thereafter it became part of the Riga Diocese. By the start of the 20th century, Orthodox believers accounted for a fifth of Estonia's population. It is unclear how large a part of all Orthodox believers in Estonia consisted of Estonians at that time. In 1914, there were 210 Orthodox congregations in the territory of Estonia and Latvia: 99 Estonian, 49 Latvian, 29 Russian, and 33 mixed congregations. It is quite evident that Estonians accounted for the greater portion of the members of Estonian Orthodox congregations and that Estonians dominated as clerics in them as well. In 1918, 74 Estonian Orthodox priests served in at least 75 Estonian Orthodox congregations, in other words 75% of Estonian congregations in Estonia. After the February Revolution, large-scale changes took place in the summer of 1917 in the organisation of the entire Orthodox Church of Russia. The most important innovations were the restoration of the church council and of the position of patriarch. Estonian Orthodox believers wished to give local Orthodox church life more of an Estonian character: church services in the Estonian language, christening using typically Estonian names, instruction in the Estonian language in Orthodox schools similarly to Lutheran schools, publication of spiritual literature in Estonian, and other such matters. Yet the most important issue for the Estonian congregations in the Riga Diocese was the restoration of the Tallinn Vicar Diocese headed by an Estonian bishop. The Russian Orthodox Church Synod granted permission for this in July of 1917. Estonian Orthodox believers made proposals to two men who had been educated at the Riga theological seminary as well as the theological academy to apply for the position of Tallinn's Vicar Bishop. Aleksander Kaelas (1880-1920), a philosophy lecturer at Moscow University, declined the offer. Paul (Pavel) Kulbusch (1869-1919), the priest of the St Petersburg Estonian congregation, also thought twice about the proposal before agreeing: 'I knew what condition our homeland was in and was familiar with its Orthodox church life. Besides, it was foreseeable what would henceforth happen in our country due to the war: plenty of sadness and hardship could be expected.' Additionally, the arrival of German forces in Estonia could be expected soon. Kulbusch was elected Vicar Bishop of Tallinn at a plenary assembly of the Riga Diocese that took place in Tartu on 10 August 1917 and was ordained on 31 December. During and after the First World War, new nation-states were created as empires collapsed. As part of this process, the Republic of Estonia was born on 24 February 1918. Estonians could not yet start building their independent state because German forces shortly captured all of Estonian territory.The occupying authorities did not recognise Estonia's independent statehood and set Estonia's annexation to Germany, the country's colonisation by Germans, and the Germanisation of Estonian cultural life as its objectives. Very little is still known about Estonian cultural life from that time. Its study will help to better understand the aspirations of Estonians in preserving their national-cultural self-awareness in 1918 under the conditions of Germanisation. The German occupying authorities were particularly ill-disposed towards everything associated with Russianness. Thus, the position of the Orthodox Church deteriorated, and the position of the Lutheran Church, which was associated with Baltic Germans, became stronger. In January of 1918, Patriarch Tikhon appointed Vicar Bishop Platon provisional acting Bishop of Riga as well. Tikhon and Platon thought that Platon would probably remain alone in his work during German rule without the support of the Russian Orthodox Church. It was not known if henceforward it would be possible at all to move about between Estonia and Russia and to exchange information. Hitherto in historical literature, it has been believed that Estonia's regular communication with the church authorities in St Petersburg and Moscow was cut off due to the German occupation. In reality, it was possible even later on in certain cases to cross the border either with the permission of the German military authorities or illegally. Bishop Platon nevertheless succeeded in sending Archdeacon Konstantin Dorin, the secretary of the Provisional Council of Riga Diocese, to Moscow to see Patriarch Tikhon in the summer of 1918. Dorin's report on his trip reveals the mutual esteem and trust that the leaders of the Estonian and Russian Orthodox churches felt regarding one another. The financial situation of the Orthodox Church deteriorated significantly in 1918 compared to 1917. On the one hand, the wartime economic difficulties affecting all of Estonia influenced this. These difficulties became even more pronounced during the German occupation, when reserves of raw materials, fuel, and food were even taken from Estonia to Germany. On the other hand, Estonian Orthodox clerics were left without any stable income due to the political changes. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks seized control of Russia's finances, including those of the Orthodox Church. Starting on 1 January 1918, the church no longer received any money from the state. The Orthodox Church in Estonia was able to operate only thanks to donations from Orthodox believers. Bishop Platon rendered very considerable services in supporting the spiritual resistance of Orthodox Estonians during the German occupation with his tours of the country, his memorandums, and the promotion of the Orthodox Church more broadly. In 1918, Platon visited 71 congregations in cities (Tartu, Voru, Valga, Parnu, Viljandi, Riga), conducted tours in Tartu and Voru counties, and around Vortsjarv Lake. Considering the fact that there were 118 congregations in Estonia's Orthodox rural deaneries in 1915, the number of congregations that he visited accounted for over half of the congregations. The bishop was most frequently in Tartu, visiting Tartu's Alexander congregation, the cleric of which was Anton Laar, who was Platon's confidant and a member of the Provisional Council of Riga Diocese. Platon's words gave clerics strength of soul to remain with their congregations in that difficult time in both worries and joys. According to Platon, the aim of his visits to congregations was to bring the people together, to affirm national self-awareness and their belief in the victory of goodness and fairness, and to encourage the people at a difficult time. Thereat Platon supported all nationalities, both Estonians and Russians. The First World War ended on 11 November 1918 and in essence, the German occupation in Estonia also ended on that date. Bishop Platon held Estonia's independence in high esteem, writing on 14 November 1918: 'Now, on historical days, when the idea of Estonian independence has finally managed to assert itself, although initially provisionally, every Estonian wishes that this loveliest idea of Estonia will also be permanently secured. In this sense, I as well, as the head of the Estonian Orthodox Church and hence the spiritual leader of 1/5 part of the Estonian people, support with all my might the firm undertaking of the Estonian people: to arrive at its complete independence.' Other Orthodox clerics also rejoiced together with the entire Estonian people regarding the end of the German occupation. Unfortunately, the end of the German occupation did not yet bring peace to Estonia. Shortly, the armed forces of Soviet Russia crossed the Estonian border, and the Estonian nation and church, power and spirit were in mortal danger. The Bolsheviks executed Bishop Platon in Tartu on 14 January 1919. He was declared a martyr-saint in 2000.																			1406-3859	2228-3897					2021	175	1-2					31	52		10.12697/AA.2021.1-2.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.12697/AA.2021.1-2.02													WOS:000735195800002

Hypolimnetic discharge from the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) lowers river temperature and reduces downstream nutrients, inducing distinct shifts in habitat conditions downstream of the dam. The inflow of major tributaries buffers these influences and creates physiochemical gradients according to the distance from the dam. We investigated the abundance, feeding, and growth of larvae of four major Chinese carps in three sections of the middle Yangtze River. Water temperature and transparency showed clear spatial gradients. Larvae in the river section closest to the dam tended to be lower in abundance and temporally delayed peak abundance and showed lower feeding intensity, poorer condition, and slower growth than those further from the dam. Our results demonstrate that physiochemical gradients influenced by the TGD have strong effects on abundance, feeding, and growth of the drifting larvae. We recommend that river sections farther from the TGD, particularly around the mouth of Poyang Lake, should become high-priority conservation areas to enhance protection of critical aquatic species.

This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed "cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning" (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction. Practical implementation of CDMIM was assessed by predicting the water quality over seasons in terms of the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, as well as water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, providing synergistic efforts to better monitor the aquatic environment and offer insightful lake watershed management strategies.

Seven metals were monitored throughout a cyanobacterial bloom season in Lake Taihu. Cyanobloom bio-dilution of the targeted metals could be explained by the negative relationships between total phytoplankton metal contents (Cu, Fe, Zn, Pb and Cr) and Chl a concentrations (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the ratios of extracellular bound to total cellular bound metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd) were positively correlated with the ratios of cyanophyta to total phytoplankton (p < 0.01), indicating the enhanced extracellular bound of these metals during cyanobloom period. Secondly, Cd, Pb and Cr were detected in several local vegetables. In comparison to reference vegetables, vegetables (e.g., radish, soybean, and cowpea), which were irrigated with cyanobloom broth collected from Lake Taihu, presented high health risk index (HRI) and were not safe for human consumption. Collectively, the frequent dominant colonial Microcystis blooms which performed high metal affinity might mediate the distribution of heavy metals in lake and potentially transferred these pollutants into terrestrial system.

However, the response of bacterial communities to toxic cyanobacterial blooms and associated microcystins (MC) remain poorly understood even though global concentrations of MC have increased dramatically in the past few decades. To address this issue, the dynamics of bacterial community composition (BCC) in the water column and how BCC is influenced by both harmful cyanobacterial blooms and environmental factors were investigated on a monthly basis from August 2013 to July 2014 in Lake Taihu, China. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that seasonal variation in BCC was significant, and that the succession of BCC greatly depends on changes in environmental conditions. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that the overall variation of BCC was explained mainly by dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and Microcystis. The alpha biodiversity of the bacterial community was different among months with the highest diversity in February and the lowest diversity in October. Furthermore, significant negative relationships were found between alpha biodiversity indices and Microcystis abundance as well as with intracellular MC concentrations, indicating that Microcystis and associated MC may influence the bacterial community structure by reducing its biodiversity. This study shows that potential associations exist between toxic cyanobacterial blooms and bacterial communities but more investigations are needed to obtain a mechanistic understanding of their complex relationships.

However, the flood storage capacity of lakes and reservoirs is ineffectively quantified at the basin scale due to the limited access to in-situ data and poor quality of optical satellite images in flooding seasons. To address this, taking a typical floodplain basin (the Poyang Lake basin) in the Yangtze as a study case, radar satellite data combined with measured bathymetry and digital elevation model data were utilized to reconstruct the time series of the water inundation area and water storage change of all lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km2 during the once-in-a-generation flood event that occurred in 2020 (termed as the 2020 flood event hereafter). Results show that the flood storage capacity of Poyang Lake can reach the maximum at 12.18 Gt, and that for other lakes and reservoirs within the basin is approximately 2.95 Gt. It indicates a total flood-storage capacity of 15.13 Gt for the basin-scale lakes and reservoirs, approximately accounting for 45.02% of the terrestrial water storage change of the basin. The storage capacity of Poyang Lake was approximately four times larger than the entirety of other lakes and reservoirs in the basin despite that its maximum water inundation area is in the proportion of 2.58 times other water bodies. This finding indicates that the Poyang Lake provided the dominant contribution to flood storage among all the lakes and reservoirs in the basin. This study introduced a remote sensing approach to quantify the flood storage capacity of basin-scale lakes and reservoirs at high spatial and temporal resolutions during the flood event, which could fill the insufficiently-quantified knowledge about dynamics of lakes and reservoirs in areas lacking full-covered in-situ data records. This study also helps to offer a quantitative basis to improve flood forecasting and control for the public authority, stakeholders, and decision -makers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of turbid flood water release on sediment deposition and phosphorus distribution in the bed sediment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Excessive phosphorus (P) loading was identified as an urgent problem during the post-Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) period. Turbid water with high suspended sediment loads has been periodically released during the flood season to mitigate sediment deposition in the TGR, but limited attention has been paid to its effect on the distribution of P in bed sediment within the reservoir. In this study, field surveys, historical monitoring data related to sediment deposition, and physiochemical properties and the fractional P content in the mainstream surface sediment and representative column sediment, were used to investigate the effect of turbid flood water release on P distribution in bed sediment. The results revealed that turbid flood water release could discharge approximately 20% of the suspended sediment inflow entering the TGR. Additionally, both the particle size of the inflow sediment and suspended sediment flux tended to decline, and the deposited sediment volume tended to constantly increase in the TGR at a rate of 0.117 billion tonnes per year between 2004 and 2016. The median particle size (MPS) was larger for surface sediment obtained in the flood season than for that obtained in the dry season, and the MPS tended to increase with an increase in the sediment depth from 0 to 20 cm. The total phosphorus (TP) content in sediment ranged from 2.6% to 17.5% lower in the flood water releasing period than in the non-flood water storing period. However, no consistent variation was detected for the vertical distribution of P fraction in the top 20 cm of bed sediment. Compared with lakes with slow deposition rates, the TGR showed a rapid sedimentation rate of >1.0 m/y, which mostly resulted in the uniform distribution of the surface sediment P fraction.

CDOM absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and stable isotope delta C-13 were determined on a seasonal basis in seventeen Chinese inland waters as well as in a series of mixing and photodegradation experiments in the lab. A strong positive linear correlation was recorded between Ic:IT and the ratio of terrestrial humic-like Cl to tryptophan-like C4 (C1 :C4) derived by parallel factor analysis. The r(2) for the linear fitting between I-c:I-T and C1:C4 (r(2) = 0.80) was notably higher than between C1:C4 and other indices tested, including the ratio of CDOM absorption at 250 nm to 365 nm, i.e. alpha(250):alpha(365) (r(2) = 0.09), spectral slope (S275-295) (r(2) = 0.26), spectral slope ratio (S-R) (r(2) = 0.31), the humification index (HIX) (r(2) = 0.47), the recent autochthonous biological contribution index (BIX) (r(2) = 0.27), and a fluorescence index (FI370) (r(2) = 0.07). I-c:I-T exhibited larger variability than the remaining six indices and a closer correlation with stable isotope delta C-13 than that observed for alpha(250):alpha(365), S275-295, S-R, FI370, and BIX during field campaigns. Confirming our field observations, significant correlations were recorded between I-C:I-T and the remaining six indices, and I-c:I-T also demonstrated notably larger variability than the six other indices during our wastewater addition experiment. Compared with HIX, eutrophic water addition and photobleaching substantially decreased I-c:I-T but had no pronounced effect on alpha(250):alpha(365), S275-297, S-R, FI370, and BIX, further suggesting that Ic:IT is the most efficient indicator of the CDOM compositional dynamics.

Water quality is traditionally estimated via linear regression based on satellite images. However, estimating and mapping water quality require a spatio-temporal nonstationary model, while TB mapping necessitates the use of geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, both of which are more precise than linear regression. Given the temporal nonstationary models for mapping water quality, GTWR offers the best option for estimating regional water quality. Compared with GWR, GTWR provides highly reliable information for water quality mapping, boasts a relatively high goodness of fit, improves the explanation of variance from 44% to 87%, and shows a sufficient space time explanatory power. The seasonal patterns of TB and the main spatial patterns of TB variability can be identified using the estimated TB maps from GTWR and by conducting an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis.

However, our ability to predict how species' interactions will vary spatially and temporally in response to seasonal variation unfortunately remains inadequate within most ecosystems. Fish assemblages in the Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) of Cambodia-a dynamic flood-pulse ecosystem-were studied for five years (2010-2014) using stable isotope and Bayesian statistical approaches to explore both within-and among-species isotopic niche variation associated with seasonal flooding. Roughly 600 individual fish specimens were collected during 19 sampling events within the lake. We found that fishes within the same species tended to have a broader isotopic niche during the wet season, likely reflecting assimilation of resources from either a wider range of isotopically distinct prey items or a variety of habitats, or both. Furthermore, among-species isotopic niches tended to overlap and range more broadly during the wet season, suggesting that floodplain inundation promotes exploitation of more diverse and similar resources by different species in the fish community. Our study highlights that the flood-pulse dynamic that is typical of tropical aquatic ecosystems may be an essential element supporting freshwater fish community structure and the fish diversity that underpins the TSL food web. This flow regime is currently threatened by regional dam development, which may in turn impact the natural function and structure of the fishery food web.					; Holtgrieve, Gordon/C-5371-2009	Chhuoy, Samol/0000-0003-3451-343X; Smits, Adrianne/0000-0001-9967-5419; Rooney, Neil/0000-0003-4360-4034; Chheng, Phen/0000-0001-9344-031X													2150-8925					JUL	2017	8	7							e01881	10.1002/ecs2.1881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1881													WOS:000406332400021

However, the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the migration and transformation of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) remains uncertain. To bridge this knowledge gap, we integrated hydrochemistry, isotopic composition (delta 13CDIC), and a hydrodynamic model (CE-QUAL-W2) to examine the distinctions, control mecha-nisms, and environmental effects of DIC biogeochemical processes in a typical large and deep reservoir (Hon-gjiadu Reservoir) under different hydrodynamic conditions. We evaluated hydrodynamic alterations through the Schmidt stability index and relative water column stability. The analysis disclosed that during weak hydrody-namics periods, the energy necessary for complete mixing the surface and deep water was 34 times higher (3615.32 J/m2 vs.106.86 J/m2), and stability was 13 times greater (312.96 vs. 24.69) compared to periods of strong hydrodynamics. Additionally, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of DIC concentrations (1.4 % to-9.1 %) and delta 13CDIC (-1.7 % to-19.5 %) from the dry to wet seasons reflected disparities in DIC control mechanisms under varied hydrodynamic conditions. Based on model simulations, our calculations indicate that during weak hy-drodynamics periods, the enhancement of the biological carbon pump effect resulted in substantial sequestration of DIC, reaching up to 379.6 t-DIC & sdot;d-1 in the water. Conversely, during strong hydrodynamics periods, DIC retention capacity decreased by 69.2 t & sdot;d-1, resulting in reservoir CO2 emissions of 22.7 x 104 t, which were more than 7 times higher than during weak hydrodynamics periods (3.2 x 104 t). Our findings emphasize the discernible impact of hydrodynamic conditions on reservoir biogeochemical processes related to DIC. Consid-ering the increasing construction of reservoirs globally, understanding and controlling hydrodynamic conditions are crucial for mitigating CO2 emissions and optimizing reservoir management.

The determination of thresholds relies on nutrient load-response curves. The spatial heterogeneity of large shallow lakes in terms of lake characteristics results in different curves shape among areas of the lake, which leads to spatial differences in thresholds. However, the spatial heterogeneity of thresholds is typically neglected; there are few methods to analyse the relationship between river loads and lake-specific area thresholds. Here, we proposed the Area Threshold Analysis Framework to analyse the spatial patterns of nutrient loads and thresholds in lakes. We first quantified the flow and load of the rivers entering the lake. The lake was then zoned and modelled to analyse area thresholds. Finally, an intuitive link between the nutrient loads of specific rivers and the thresholds of specific areas of the lake was established. The results showed a nonlinear without hysteresis response in all areas of Chaohu Lake; the nutrient loads and thresholds were highly variable in space, showing a trend of increasing and then decreasing from west to east. Flow density and wind might be important in influencing the spatial distribution of thresholds. The different effects of the wind and flow density on total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) lead to large differences in the thresholds with TP and Chl-a as management objectives, respectively. The large gap between nutrient loads and thresholds made it important for management to consider appropriate management goals to deal with unrealistic nutrient reductions. Achieving year-round Chl-a <= 30 mu g/ l in Chaohu Lake was easier than TP <= 0.05 mg/l, since for the latter, the Shiwuli, Paihe, and Nanfei river loads needed reductions of >80 %. In addition, for Area 1 and 2, it was more practical to first start meeting TP <= 0.05 mg/l for 2 or 3 seasons of the year than for 4 seasons. Overall, we developed a new framework for spatial threshold analysis and established an intuitive link between nutrient loads and thresholds in large shallow lakes. These results are valuable for understanding the threshold properties of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general and provide a reference for watershed nutrient management and ecological restoration of lakes.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2022	613		B						128466	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128466	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128466		SEP 2022											WOS:000862475900003

Sinninghe			Seasonal variability in the abundance and stable carbon-isotopic composition of lipid biomarkers in suspended particulate matter from a stratified equatorial lake (Lake Chala, Kenya/Tanzania): Implications for the sedimentary record	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We studied the distribution and stable carbon-isotopic (delta C-13) composition of various lipid biomarkers in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the water column of Lake Chala, a permanently stratified crater lake in equatorial East Africa, to evaluate their capacity to reflect seasonality in water-column processes and associated changes in the lake's phytoplankton community. This lake has large seasonal variation in water-column dynamics (stratified during wet seasons and mixing during dry seasons) with associated phytoplankton succession. We analyzed lipid biomarkers in SPM collected monthly at 5 depths (0-80 m) from September 2013 to January 2015. Seasonal variation in total phytoplankton biovolume is strongly reflected in the concentration of phytadienes, a derivative of the general photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll. The wax and wane of several specific biomarker lipids between June and December 2014 reflect pronounced phytoplankton succession after deep mixing, starting with a long and sustained chlorophyte bloom (reflected by C-23:1, C-28:1 and C-27:1 n-alkenes, and C-21 and C-23 n-alkanes), followed by a peak in diatoms between July and October (loliolide and isololiolide), and then eustigmatophytes (C-30 and C-32 1,15 diols) once stratification resumes in October. Peak abundance of the C-19:1 n-alkene during shallow mixing of the water column in January February 2014 can be tentatively linked to the seasonal distribution of cyanobacteria. The concentration, seasonal variability, and low delta C-13 values of the C-28 fatty acid in the SPM suggest that this biomarker is produced in the water column of Lake Chala instead of having the typically assumed vascular plant origin. The delta C-13 signature of particulate carbon and all aquatic biomarkers become increasingly more negative (by up to 16 parts per thousand) during mixing-induced episodes of high productivity, whereas enrichment would be expected during such blooms. This reversed fractionation may be attributed to chemically enhanced diffusion, which generates depleted HCO3- under high pH (>9) conditions, as occur in the epilimnion of Lake Chala during periods of high productivity. The influence of this process can potentially explain previously observed C-13-depleted carbon signatures in the paleo-record of lake Chala, and should be considered prior to paleorecord interpretation of organic-matter delta C-13 values derived (partially) from aquatic organisms in high-pH, i.e. alkaline, lakes.

Airborne hyperspectral data to assess suspended particulate matter and aquatic vegetation in a shallow and turbid lake	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This paper presents an application of a physic-based method that relies on spectral inversion procedures to simultaneously estimate concentrations of water constituents, water column heights (cH) and benthic substrate types in Lake Trasimeno (Italy) from airborne imaging spectrometry. Complex waters of this lake are challenging due to the coexistence of optically-deep turbid waters and of optically-shallow waters, mostly characterised by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds. Airborne data acquired on 12 May 2009 by Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) were converted into remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) with the atmospheric correction code ATCOR. A spectral inversion procedure implementing a bio-optical model (namely BOMBER), parameterised with in-situ-data; was-firstly run-to-retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (i.e. a(CDOM)(440)) in the optically-deep waters. The areas where the retrieved optimisation error was higher than 10% were instead assumed as optically-shallow. In these areas two maps depicting the linear unmixing of three substrate types (i.e., siltyclay, Chara ssp. and other hydrophyte) and the water column heights were produced. The MIVIS-derived products were validated with field data providing a reliable estimation of SPM, chl-a, a(CDOM)(440) and cH (determination coefficients always R-2 > 0.7). SPM concentrations were also similar to a 5.4-km long transect of flow-through turbidity data, and the SAV map was comparable to in situ observations. Generally, the colonisation patterns of SAV were reflecting the spatial distribution of SPM concentrations. In particular, the positive role of Chara on keeping SPM concentrations low was observed. Future research should extend this application to remote sensing data acquired in other seasons to trace the dynamics of SAV and its effect on spatial water clarity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Lukich, V; Cowling, S; Chazan, M				Lukich, Vasilija; Cowling, Sharon; Chazan, Michael			Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Kathu Pan, South Africa, based on sedimentological data	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Several studies have highlighted the importance of collecting well-dated records of palaeoenvironmental changes on desert margins, particularly in the semi-arid interior of southern Africa. Here we describe sediments at three sites in Kathu Pan, a pan complex overlying karstic bedrock at the southern edge of the Kalahari Basin. Sinkholes have exposed sedimentary sequences dating back to the Pleistocene, making it possible to document multiple palaeoenvironmental regimes in this landscape. Using a multi analytical sedimentological approach, including micromorphology, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, electron microprobe, loss-on-ignition, laser diffractometry and luminescence dating, we demonstrate that the sediments at Kathu Pan represent an environment fluctuating among a number of thresholds for accumulation of different kinds of transported and authigenic sediments. Within the Pleistocene sands at the base of our studied sedimentary sequence, the presence of palygorskite, indicative of less extreme evaporative control, represents a semi-arid environment from 156 +/- 11 ka to 32 +/- 2 ka (Marine Isotope Stages 6-3). Increased moisture availability at 84 +/- 4 ka and at 96 +/- 5 ka (possibly during Marine Isotope Stages 5a and 5c, respectively) is reflected in the sands by the formation of palygorskite in concert with the deposition and oxidation of organic material. As the climate became increasingly arid, possibly in response to global cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum (21 +/- 2 ka), Kathu Pan crossed a threshold, and deposition of CaCO3 dominated over that of palygorskite. In the Holocene beds within our studied unit, alternating CaCO3- and organic-dominated deposits, sometimes in very fine laminae, reflect an increase in the amplitude of either seasonal or annual changes in water availability.

Eutrophication and climate change may accelerate methane emissions from estuaries, causing positive feedbacks with global warming. Boreal regions will warm rapidly in the coming decades, increasing the need to understand methane cycling in these systems. In this 3-year study, we investigated seasonal and spatial variability of methane dynamics in a eutrophied boreal estuary, both in the water column and underlying sediments. The estuary and the connected archipelago were consistently a source of methane to the atmosphere, although the origin of emitted methane varied with distance offshore. In the estuary, the river was the primary source of atmospheric methane. In contrast, in the adjacent archipelago, sedimentary methanogenesis fueled by eutrophication over previous decades was the main source. Methane emissions to the atmosphere from the study area were highly variable and dependent on local hydrodynamics and environmental conditions. Despite evidence of highly active methanogenesis in the studied sediments, the vast majority of the upwards diffusive flux of methane was removed before it could escape to the atmosphere, indicating that oxidative filters are presently still functioning regardless of previous eutrophication and ongoing climate change.

However, the impact of changes in the hydrological environment of natural wetlands on litter input to S-SOCP remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of hydrological changes (soil water content [SWC] and days of flooding [DF]) on the litter decomposition process and S-SOCP were investigated from January 2018 to November 2019 in the Dongting Lake floodplain of China. Furthermore, the contribution of litter to the S-SOCP in Carex meadow and Reed wetland were calculated. The results showed that a large part of litter (approximately 50%-70%) decomposed annually, especially during the flooding season. Litter contributed 283.68 g C m(-2) a(-1) to the S-SOCP in the Carex meadow and 275.24 g C m(-2) a(-1) to the Reed wetland. In the Carex meadow and Reed wetland, the belowground litter contribution was higher than the aboveground litter during the non-flooding season. In contrast, during the flooding season, the aboveground litter contribution in the Carex meadow is higher, whereas the belowground litter dominates in the Reed wetland. The SWC indicated a positive correlation with soil organic carbon (SOC) and a negative correlation with the microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Carex meadow. However, SWC shows a negative correlation with SOC and a positive correlation with MBC in the Reed wetland during the non-flooding season. During the flooding season, the variation of DOC during the flooding season (Delta DOC) is positively correlated with DF in the Carex meadow and Reed wetland. SWC and DF are the main drivers of litter decomposition into the S-SOCP in non-flooding and flooding seasons, respectively. Therefore, the construction of microhabitat with prolonged flooding and relatively higher soil water content are essential ways to improve the carbon sequestration potential in floodplains.

The mobility of phosphorus, iron, and manganese through the sediment-water continuum of a shallow eutrophic freshwater lake under stratified and mixed water-column conditions	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The management of external nutrient inputs to eutrophic systems can be confounded due to a persistent pool of phosphorus (P) in lake sediments. The behaviors of P and trace metals depend largely on the reductive dissolution of amorphous iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) (oxy)hydroxides in sediments; however, a holistic understanding of these dynamics in relation to the broader ecological and hydrodynamic conditions of the system remains elusive. We used a high-frequency monitoring approach to develop a comprehensive conceptual model of P, Mn, and Fe dynamics across the sediment water continuum of a shallow bay in Lake Champlain (Missisquoi Bay, USA). The greatest release of sediment P, Mn, and Fe occurred under stable hydrodynamic conditions, particularly during the onset of the cyanobacterial bloom and was associated with low available P and the accumulation of soluble Mn and Fe above the sediment-water interface (SWI). During the warmest part of the season, bloom severity and sediment P release was partially regulated by hydrodynamic drivers, which changed on hourly time scales to affect redox conditions at the SWI and bottom water concentrations of soluble P, Mn, and Fe. A geochemically distinct increase in soluble P and Fe concentrations, but not Mn, marked the influence of riverine inputs during a late season storm disturbance. Despite continued depletion of the reactive sediment P and metals pool into the bloom period, declining temperatures and a well-mixed water column resulted in bloom senescence and the return of P, Mn, and Fe to surface sediments. The closed cycling of P and metals in Missisquoi Bay poses a significant challenge for the long-term removal of P from this system. Multiple time-scale measures of physical and biogeochemical changes provide a basis for understanding P and trace metals behavior across sediments and the water column, which shape seasonally variable cyanobacterial blooms in shallow eutrophic systems.					; XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012	Giles, Courtney/0000-0003-2563-2920; Isles, Peter/0000-0003-4446-6788; Schroth, Andrew/0000-0001-5553-3208; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				JAN	2016	127	1					15	34		10.1007/s10533-015-0144-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-015-0144-x													WOS:000368722700002

Variations in high-latitude riverine fluorescent dissolved organic matter: A comparison of large Arctic rivers	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Given the pace of climate change, it is important to better understand dissolved organic matter (DOM) storage and cycling in high-latitude rivers and its subsequent export to the Arctic Ocean. To address this concern, excitation/emission matrix spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) coupled with optical indices were used to characterize the optical properties of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) and colored DOM (CDOM) in five large Arctic rivers over two seasonal cycles. Five PARAFAC components were identified and proved useful indicators for the quantitative and qualitative descriptions of DOM sources and modification processes within Arctic watersheds. In comparing Pan-Arctic relationships between the optical properties and chemical properties of DOM, three components traced terrigenous biomarkers and two components are introduced as potential indicators for microbial processing. Conversely, no individual PARAFAC component could be directly linked to a specific plant source or river and simpler absorbance indices (i.e., a(350)) proved to be better suited to quantify dissolved organic carbon and lignin phenol concentrations. Differences in FDOM character between the rivers could be explained by general watershed characteristics, including vegetation, topography, and hydrology. Based on these differences, the influence of coniferous vegetation on DOM character is most apparent in the Lena and Yenisei Rivers and bog-derived FDOM sources are more important in the Ob River. This study illustrates how increased hydrological connectivity in the Ob catchment and the abundance of lakes within the Mackenzie watershed may influence FDOM concentrations and the microbial processing of DOM within these watersheds.

Serious algal bloom in the west basin of Lake Chaohu (WLC) resulted in higher organic C accumulation and NO3--N deficiency in interstitial water compared to the east basin of Lake Chaohu (ELC), jointly leading to a high C/NO3--N ratio. This triggered dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) over denitrification in terms of higher DNRA rate, nitrogen retaining index (NRI), and nrfA gene abundance mediating DNRA. Furthermore, high oxygen-alkyl C and abundance of functional genes mediating labile organic C decomposition and DNRA suggested that the alkyl carbon-oxygen bond was responsible for DNRA induction. Different bacterial community composition and diversity involved in C and nitrogen (N) metabolism in two basins indicated that bacteria in sediments of WLC were more active in NO3--N reduction. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the less represented genera, such as Thiobacillus and Clostridium, were positively correlated with both organic C and NO3--N reduction rates, respectively. Hence, organic C composition could affect NO3--N reduction function by shaping the specific bacterial community.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JUL 15	2022	220								118720	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118720		JUN 2022						35700644					WOS:000815781200002
J	Chávez-García, E; Siebe, C				Chavez-Garcia, Elizabeth; Siebe, Christina			Rehabilitation of a highly saline-sodic soil using a rubble barrier and organic amendments	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The application of biochar and compost is a promising alternative to recover salt-degraded soils. However, in areas where the main source of salinity comes from the groundwater, it is also necessary to restrict the capillary rise of salts by means of a barrier. In this study, we show results of a field experiment, in which we tested the effect of a rubble barrier and the addition of biochar and compost on the establishment of a salt-tolerant grass (Distichlis spicata) in a highly saline-sodic soil. Our results showed that the capillary barrier: i) diminished the electrical conductivity and the CO2 fluxes by about one third to one half the values without barrier for both variables, ii) decreased the topsoil moisture (without barrier ca. 25-35%; barrier-zone ca. 15-25%), and iii) promoted the plant growth. Organic amendments did not show any effect. However, high-dose treatments had lower moisture content than the unamended ones (ca. 3-6% less water). Arrival of new plant species occurred preferably in the barrier-zone. We conclude that the barrier is an effective tool to decrease the soil salinity, but irrigation is needed to overcome smaller soil moisture during the dry season. Pyrochar was the most re-commendable amendment to be used. However, biochar and compost doses were insufficient for the rehabilitation of this highly saline-sodic soil. The natural emergence of plant species (Suaeda torreyana, Kochia scoparia and Sonchus oleraceus) can improve the rehabilitation activities in an effective and inexpensive way. Urban residues can effectively be used to establish a plant cover in saline-sodic soils.

The present study investigates the water and sediment bacteria by epifluorescence microscopy in the reservoir (above the dam site), as well as in the downstream river stretches (below-dam site) at the middle reach of Lancang River during the wet, the normal and the dry seasons. The results demonstrated that the reservoir operating regime (water discharge variations) and strong precipitation promoted significant differences in the conditions of the river below the dam, especially for the concentration of dissolved oxygen, redox potential, electric conductivity, turbidity, and total dissolved solids in water and concentration of microbial activity in sediment. The seasonal variations were also key factors influencing water quality at the below-dam sampling sites. Nutrients concentration did not induce a significant response in bacterial abundance when inorganic nutrients were sufficient. Bacterial density in sediment was regulated by hydropower-related discharge, particle size, and type of sediments, while bacterial abundances in water were strongly linked with the physicochemical characteristics of the water, such as total dissolved solids and conductivity.

We developed a mercury (Hg) biogeochemical model for the Baltic Sea and used it to investigate the impact of eutrophication on phytoplankton MeHg concentrations. For model evaluation, we measured total methylated Hg (MeHgT) in the Baltic Sea and found low concentrations (39 +/- 16 fM) above the halocline and high concentrations in anoxic waters (1249 +/- 369 fM). To close the Baltic Sea MeHgT budget, we inferred an average normoxic water column HgII methylation rate constant of 2 x 10-4 d-1. We used the model to compare Baltic Seas present-day (2005-2014) eutrophic state to an oligo/mesotrophic scenario. Eutrophication increases primary production and export of organic matter and associated Hg to the sediment effectively removing Hg from the active biogeochemical cycle; this results in a 27% lower present-day water column Hg reservoir. However, increase in organic matter production and remineralization stimulates microbial Hg methylation resulting in a seasonal increase in both water and phytoplankton MeHg reservoirs above the halocline. Previous studies of systems dominated by external MeHg sources or benthic production found eutrophication to decrease MeHg levels in plankton. This Baltic Sea study shows that in systems with MeHg production in the normoxic water column eutrophication can increase phytoplankton MeHg content.

J	Costa, D; Zhang, H; Levison, J				Costa, Diogo; Zhang, Helen; Levison, Jana			Impacts of climate change on groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin: A review	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Climate change has the potential to alter the physical and chemical properties of water in the Great Lakes Basin, in turn impacting ecological function. This study synthesizes existing research associated with the potential effects of a changing climate on the quality and quantity of groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin. It includes analyses of impacts on (1) recharge, (2) groundwater storage, (3) discharge and groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions, (4) exacerbating future urban development impacts on groundwater, (5) groundwater quality, and (6) ecohydrology. Large spatial and temporal (i.e., seasonal) variability in groundwater response to climate change between regions is anticipated. Most studies combine field observations with modelling, but many have focused only on small/medium basins. At these small scales, groundwater systems are generally projected to be fairly resilient to climate change impacts. However, modelling studies of larger basins (e.g., Grand River, Saginaw Bay, Maumee River) predict an increase in groundwater storage. Uncertainty in model simulations, particularly from climate models that are used to force hydrological models, is a major challenge. There have been too few studies to date that investigate the interplay of climate change and groundwater quality in the Great Lakes Basin to draw conclusions about future groundwater quality and ecohydrology. A summary of methods, models, and technology is provided. Model uncertainty has become an increasingly important topic and is also discussed. The study concludes with a synthesis of the main science needs to understand groundwater impacts in order to adapt to a changing climate in the Great Lakes Basin.

Although it has been shown that high levels of rainfall may inhibit the growth of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, it is still unclear how cyanobacteria respond to short-term rainfall events. Based on five-year (2016-2020) high-frequency (half-week) sampling data from a shallow eutrophic urban reservoir in subtropical China, we explored the short-term effects of rainfall events on cyanobacterial biomass (CBB) by constructing generalized additive models of CBB in rainy periods during warm (April to September) and cool (December and January) months, respectively. We find evidence in support of the hypotheses that short-term rainfall events significantly reduce CBB in warm months, but the opposite response was observed in the cool months. We also highlight a difference in the factors explaining CBB decreases in warm months (precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, dissolved oxygen and total phosphorus) compared with factors explaining the response of CBB in cool months (sunshine hours, pH and total carbon). In particular, meteorological factors (precipitation, wind speed and sunlight) might drive changes in water temperature and hydro-dynamics of the reservoir, thereby causing a rapid reduction of CBB after rainfall events in warm months. This varying response of cyanobacteria to short-term rainfall events in the shallow eutrophic subtropical reservoir may also be expected in temperate or cool lakes as climate change effects become stronger.					chen, huihuang/AAB-8350-2019; Jin, Lei/LTC-5842-2024; Xue, Yuanyuan/ADI-1424-2022; Carvalho, Laurence/D-3276-2009; Luo, Anqi/KEJ-6939-2024; YANG, Jun/E-6680-2011; Yang, Jun/E-6680-2011	Luo, Anqi/0000-0001-5069-108X; YANG, Jun/0000-0002-7920-2777; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 25	2022	827								154172	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154172		MAR 2022						35231504					WOS:000790800200018
J	Peterson, M; Mach, D; Buechler, D				Peterson, Michael; Mach, Douglas; Buechler, Dennis			A Global LIS/OTD Climatology of Lightning Flash Extent Density	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Previous lightning climatologies derived from Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) total lightning measurements have quantified lightning frequency as a Flash Rate Density (FRD). This approach assumes that lightning flashes can be represented as points and quantifies the frequency of lightning centered in each grid cell. However, lightning has a finite extent that can reach hundreds of kilometers. A new climatology based on Flash Extent Density (FED) is constructed for LIS (including ISS-LIS) and OTD that accounts for the horizontal dimension of lightning. The FED climatology documents the frequency that an observer can expect lightning to be visible overhead-regardless of where the flash began or ended. This new FED climatology confirms and elaborates on the previous global LIS/OTD FRD and Americas-only Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) findings. The FED climatology maintains Lake Maracaibo as the global lightning hotspot with an average of 389 flashes/day but designates Karabre in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as the global thunderstorm duty (percent of the total viewtime where lightning is observed) hotspot at 7.29%. Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur is the national capital city with the most lightning, and its airport (KUL) is the top major airport affected by lightning (in terms of duty). The FED seasonal cycle and month-to-month changes in the "center of lightning" for the three continental chimney regions are also discussed. Plain Language Summary How often does lightning occur around the world? This seemingly simple question is difficult to answer due to nuances in measuring lightning and calculating flash rates. A common methodology for answering this question is to use the concept of Flash Rate Density (FRD). This approach quantifies lightning rates by approximating lightning as points. Lightning flashes often have appreciable horizontal extents, however, that can even reach extreme sizes. In this study, we use the concept of Flash Extent Density (FED) to produce a climatology of lightning frequency that takes the horizonal scale of lightning into account. Instead of just incrementing a single grid point once for each flash, FED increments all grid point pixels that each flash touches by one. FED addresses the question of how many flashes per year an observer at a specific location can expect to see overhead. We find that despite these methodological differences from previous FRD studies, the same global hotspots are identified-with Lake Maracaibo chief among them. However, this new approach provides new insights on the previously noted lightning trends and elaborates on how frequent lightning impacts life on Earth. Key Points LIS and OTD data are reprocessed to correct split lightning flashes and generate gridded products including Flash Extent Density (FED) A global lightning climatology is generated from FED data that take horizontal flash extent into account The new FED climatologies provide new perspectives on lightning frequency and human impact while confirming previous FRD findings						Mach, Douglas/0000-0002-4541-6590; Buechler, Dennis/0000-0002-2043-6106; Peterson, Michael/0000-0002-7683-0655													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 20	2021	126	8							e2020JD033885	10.1029/2020JD033885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033885													WOS:000664863900004

However, temporally consistent ground-based and long-term observed rainfall data are usually lacking for such analyses, especially in mountainous and developing countries. In the absence of such data, satellite-derived rainfall products, such as the Climate Hazard Infrared Precipitations with Stations (CHIRPS) and Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrieval (GPM-IMERG) can be used. However, as their performance varies from region to region, it is of interest to evaluate the accuracy of satellite-derived rainfall products at the basin scale using ground-based observations. In this study, we evaluated and demonstrated the performance of the three-run GPM-IMERG (early, late, and final) and CHIRPS rainfall datasets against the ground-based observations over the Ziway Lake Basin in Ethiopia. We performed the analysis at monthly and seasonal time scales from 2000 to 2014, using multiple statistical evaluation criteria and graphical methods. While both GPM-IMERG and CHIRPS showed good agreement with ground-observed rainfall data at monthly and seasonal time scales, the CHIRPS products slightly outperformed the GPM-IMERG products. The study thus concluded that CHIRPS or GPM-IMERG rainfall data can be used as a surrogate in the absence of ground-based observed rainfall data for monthly or seasonal agro-hydrological studies.

J	Beltráo, H; Zuanon, J; Ferreira, E				Beltrao, Helio; Zuanon, Jansen; Ferreira, Efrem			Checklist of the ichthyofauna of the Rio Negro basin in the Brazilian Amazon	ZOOKEYS												This study presents an extensive review of published and unpublished occurrence records of fish species in the Rio Negro drainage system within the Brazilian territory. The data was gathered from two main sources: 1) litterature compilations of species occurrence records, including original descriptions and revisionary studies; and 2) specimens verification at the INPA fish collection. The results reveal a rich and diversified ichthyofauna, with 1,165 species distributed in 17 orders (+ two incertae sedis), 56 families, and 389 genera. A large portion of the fish fauna (54.3% of the species) is composed of small-sized fishes < 10 cm in standard length. The main groups are Characiformes (454 species; 39.0%), Siluriformes (416; 35.7%), Gymnotiformes (105; 9.0%), and Cichliformes (102; 8.8%). The species composition differs between the main aquatic environments, such as: main channel (159 species), lakes (296), tributary rivers (596), small streams (234), seasonal beaches (186), and rapids (41). Part of the ichthyofauna is shared with adjacent basins, such as the Orinoco, rivers of the Guiana Shield, lower Solimoes/Amazonas and upper Amazonas, which contributes to the remarkable ichthyofaunal diversity of the basin. A high rate of species endemism was observed in Characidae (24), Loricariidae (18), Cichlidae (18) and Callichthyidae (18), totalling 156 species (13.4%) endemic to the basin. An estimation of the species richness for the Rio Negro basin, considering 23 published references, resulted in 1,466 and 1,759 species (Jackknife 1 and 2, respectively), which seems reasonable when considering the large number of morphotypes left out of the present list and the low sampling effort in many areas of the basin. The results presented herein provide an additional tool for environmental managers and decision makers for conservation purposes of one of the richest and most well-preserved sub-basins of the Rio Amazonas system.					; Beltrão, Hélio/P-4638-2017; Ferreira, Efrem/J-4570-2014; Zuanon, Jansen/E-5791-2013	Ferreira, Efrem/0000-0003-4027-6207; Zuanon, Jansen/0000-0001-8354-2750													1313-2989	1313-2970				OCT 17	2019		881					53	89		10.3897/zookeys.881.32055	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.881.32055								31662611					WOS:000492026200004
J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Yao, J; Werner, AD; Li, XH				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Yao, Jing; Werner, Adrian D.; Li, Xianghu			Hydrodynamic and Hydrological Modeling of the Poyang Lake Catchment System in China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												In this paper, a distributed catchment-hydrology model and a physically based lake hydrodynamic model were used to simulate the large-scale and highly dynamic lake catchment system of Poyang Lake, in the middle reach of the Yangtze River basin, China. The simulation of the hydrodynamics of the lake is a significant extension to previous efforts to simulate Poyang Lake's considerable variability in lake extent and flow rates. Further, the combination of the distributed catchment-hydrology model and the lake-hydrodynamic model, applied to a highly dynamic and large-scale system, is a rare attempt to develop a physically based management model of this complexity and scale. Model calibration and validation were undertaken to evaluate the model's performance and to enhance its effectiveness in simulating catchment discharges, lake water levels, lake water surface areas, and lake flow patterns. The results showed a satisfactory agreement with field observations, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.71-0.84 for catchment discharges, 0.88-0.98 for lake water levels, and 0.80 for lake outflows during the calibration period. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values for the validation period, ranging from 0.62 to 0.97, were largely consistent with the calibration values. Further investigation of the results showed that the modeling approach simulated adequately the lake hydrodynamics in terms of the flow fields within the lake and the seasonal changes in the lake water surface area. The outcomes of this paper will benefit future modeling efforts by providing a tool for predicting the hydrology of Poyang Lake and its catchment under climate variability and land-use changes.					; Werner, Adrian/F-2222-2015; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Xianghu/0000-0001-9934-1822; Werner, Adrian/0000-0002-1190-1301; Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													1084-0699	1943-5584				MAR 1	2014	19	3					607	616		10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000835													WOS:000332673600012

Here we present a quantitative hydroclimate reconstruction for the last ca. 200 kyr from southern Iberian Peninsula based on pollen data from the Padul lake sediment record. We use the newly developed Scale-normalized Significant Zero crossing (SnSiZer) method to detect not only the statistically significant precipitation changes but also to estimate the relative magnitude of these oscillations in our reconstruction. We identify six statistically significant main humid phases, termed West Mediterranean Humid Periods (WMHP 1-6). These humid periods correlate with other West/Central Mediterranean paleohydrological records, suggesting that similar climatic factors affected different areas of the Mediterranean. In addition, the WMPHs are roughly coeval with the African Humid Periods (AHPs) during high seasonality, suggesting the same North Atlantic ocean-atmospheric dynamics and orbital forcing as main drivers of both areas. In contrast, during low seasonality periods, the West Mediterranean still appears to be affected by the westerlies and the local Mediterranean rainfall systems with moderate-to-high precipitation, whereas West Africa was characterized by droughts.

Worldwide lake level trends and responses to background climate variation	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lakes provide many important benefits to society, including drinking water, flood attenuation, nutrition, and recreation. Anthropogenic environmental changes may affect these benefits by altering lake water levels. However, background climate oscillations such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation can obscure long-term trends in water levels, creating uncertainty over the strength and ubiquity of anthropogenic effects on lakes. Here we account for the effects of background climate variation and test for long-term (1992-2019) trends in water levels in 200 globally distributed large lakes using satellite altimetry data. The median percentage of water level variation associated with background climate variation was 58 %, with an additional 10 % explained by seasonal variation and 25 % by the long-term trend. The relative influence of specific axes of background climate variation on water levels varied substantially across and within regions. After removing the effects of background climate variation on water levels, long-term water level trend estimates were lower (median: + 0.8 cm yr(-1)) than calculated from raw water level data (median: +1.2 cm yr(-1)). However, the trends became more statistically significant in 86 % of lakes after removing the effects of background climate variation (the median p value of trends changed from 0.16 to 0.02). Thus, robust tests for long-term trends in lake water levels which may or may not be anthropogenic will require prior isolation and removal of the effects of background climate variation. Our findings suggest that background climate variation often masks long-term trends in environmental variables but can be accounted for through more comprehensive statistical analyses.					; Kraemer, Benjamin/AAV-9299-2021	McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552; Seimon, Anton/0000-0001-7326-0442; Kraemer, Benjamin/0000-0002-3390-9005													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAY 18	2020	24	5					2593	2608		10.5194/hess-24-2593-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2593-2020													WOS:000535285200001

However, understanding of sediment dynamics in a shallow lake influenced by flood pulse is unclear. We tested a hypothesis that floodplain vegetation plays as a significant role in lessening the intensity of resuspension process in a shallow lake characterized by the flood pulse system. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate sediment dynamics in this type of shallow lake. The target was Tonle Sap Lake (TSL), which is a large shallow lake influenced by a flood pulse system of Mekong River located in Southeast Asia. An extensive and seasonal sampling survey was conducted to measure total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations, sedimentation and resuspension rates in TSL and its 4 floodplain areas. The study revealed that sedimentation process was dominant (TSS ranged: 3-126 mg L-1) in the high water period (September-December) while resuspension process was dominant (TSS ranged: 4-652 mg L-1) only in the low water period (March-June). In addition, floodplain vegetation reduced the resuspension of sediment (up to 26.3%) in water. The implication of the study showed that resuspension is a seasonally dominant process in shallow lake influenced by the flood pulse system at least for the case of TSL. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These structures are one of the major meteorological systems in the meridional transport of moisture on a global scale. In this work, we focus on the southerly Great Plains low-level jet, which plays an important role in the moisture transport balance over the central United States. The Gulf of Mexico is the main moisture source for the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ), which has been identified as a key factor for rainfall modulation over the eastern and central US. The relationship between moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Plains and precipitation has been well documented in previous studies. Nevertheless, a large uncertainty still remains in the quantification of the moisture amount actually carried by the GPLLJ. The main goal of this work is to address this question. For this purpose, a relatively new tool, the regional atmospheric Weather Research and Forecasting Model with 3-D water vapour tracers (WRF-WVT; Insua-Costa and Miguez-Macho, 2018) is used together with the Lagrangian model FLEXPART to estimate the load of precipitable water advected within the GPLLJ. Both models were fed with data from ERA Interim. From a climatology of jet intensity over a 37-year period, which follows a Gaussian distribution, we select five cases for study, representing the mean and 1 and 2 standard deviations above and below it. Results show that the jet is responsible for roughly 70 %-80 % of the moisture transport occurring in the southern Great Plains when a jet event occurs. Furthermore, moisture transport by the GPLLJ extends to the north-east US, accounting for 50 % of the total in areas near the Great Lakes. Vertical distributions show the maximum of moisture advected by the GPLLJ at surface levels and maximum values of moisture flux about 500 m above, in coincidence with the wind speed profile.

The surface water samples were collected from the main rivers and lakes in the urban area monthly from July 2013 to June 2014 (except the frozen period). Laboratory analyses revealed that parabens were ubiquitous in the surface water of Beijing. PHBA was the predominant compound in the surface water samples, with the average concentration of 239 ng L-1,followed by the total amount of chlorinated parabens (average 50.1 ng/L) and parabens (average 443 ng/L). It is noteworthy that octylparaben with longer chain was firstly detected in the surface water. Significant difference was observed for paraben concentrations from different sampling sites, and the highest level of parabens was found in the Xiaotaihou River, which was mainly due to the untreated sewage discharge. Seasonal variation of target compounds in the urban surface water was also studied, and parabens exhibited a different temporal variation from chlorinated derivatives. A combination of factors including high residual chlorine level and water temperature as well as intense ultraviolet radiation might enhance the persistence of chlorinated parabens in chlorinated water during the wet season.

The aim of this study was to investigate the abundance, characteristics and risks posed by microplastics in the Zandvlei Catchment and Estuary in Cape Town, South Africa. Water and sediment were sampled between 2019 and 2021, during wet and dry seasons, MPs extracted and identified using microscopy and fourier-transformed infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR) analyses. MP abundances were 70.23 +/- 7.36 (standard error) MPs/Kg dw in sediment and 2.62 +/- 0.41 MP/L in water samples for the study period. Lower reaches of the catchment and upper reaches of the estuary can be considered sinks for MP contamination as these sites recorded higher MP abundances. MPs were mainly transparent fibres smaller than 0.5 mm. Polyethylene (46%) followed by polypropylene (16%) fibres were the most common polymers recorded. Pollution load indices in MPs were categorised as dangerous in both water and sediment. MP polymer risk indices ranged from moderate in catchment sediment to very high in catchment water. Pollution risk indices were categories as dangerous in water (catchment and sediment) and sediment estuary but low in catchment sediment. Ecological risk assessments hence indicated that polymers in water and sediment were mostly dangerous and poses a threat to the ecological health of both the catchment and estuary studied.					; Sparks, Conrad/E-2768-2018	Awe, Adetunji/0000-0001-9811-9824; Sparks, Conrad/0000-0001-9721-3544; Samuels, Whitney/0000-0003-2526-0362; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				FEB 1	2024	342								122987	10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122987		DEC 2023						38030107					WOS:001134289200001

Coastal geomorphic response to seasonal water-level rise in the Laurentian Great Lakes: An example from Illinois Beach State Park, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hydrodynamic processes, such as fluctuating water levels, waves, and currents, shape coastlines across timescales ranging from minutes to millennia. In large lacustrine systems, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes, the role of water level in driving long-term (centuries to millennia) coastal evolution is well understood. However, additional research is needed to explore short-term (weeks to months) beach geomorphic response to fluctuating water level. Developing a process-focused understanding of how water level fluctuations shape coastal response across these shorter time scales is imperative for coastal management. Here, we present measurements of geomorphic response along a lacustrine beach ridge plain to seasonal water level fluctuations during a decadal high-stand in Lake Michigan water level. Frequent topographic change measurements revealed high spatial and temporal variability in geomorphic response to rising lake level. Sites immediately downdrift of shore protection began to erode immediately as lake level increased. The co-occurrence of peak seasonal lake levels and a modest increase in wave energy resulted in erosion and overwash at sites that resisted erosion during the initial seasonal rise in lake level. None of the sites in this study returned to their initial morphology following seasonal lake level rise. Given that peak water levels were nearly identical in 2017 and 2018, yet the majority of erosion at our sites occurred in 2017, we postulate that erosion associated with seasonal lake level rise is primarily a function of the change in annual maximum water level from year to year, rather than solely the elevation of the water level.

The dissolved and cell-bound forms of three microcystin (MC) congeners (MC-LR, MC-RR and MC-YR) and four taste-and-odor compounds (geosmin, 2-methyl isoborneol, -cyclocitral and -ionone) were investigated monthly from August 2011 to July 2012 in the eastern drinking water source of Lake Chaohu. The total concentrations of microcystins and taste-and-odor compounds reached 8.86 g/L and 250.7 ng/L, respectively. The seasonal trends of microcystins were not consistent with those of the taste-and-odor compounds, which were accompanied by dominant species Microcystis and Dolichospermum. The fate of the cyanobacteria and metabolites were determined simultaneously after the processes of coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination in the associated full-scale DWTP. The dissolved fractions with elevated concentrations were detected after some steps and the breakthrough of cyanobacteria and metabolites were even observed in finished water. Chlorophyll-a limits at intake were established for the drinking water source based on our investigation of multiple metabolites, seasonal variations and their elimination rates in the DWTP. Not only microcystins but also taste-and-odor compounds should be taken into account to guide the management in source water and in DWTPs.					; Feng, Muhua/AAN-6818-2020; Liu, Feifei/HOH-3748-2023	Shang, Lixia/0000-0002-6387-3373; 													2072-6651					JAN	2018	10	1							26	10.3390/toxins10010026	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins10010026								29301296					WOS:000424096500026

However, the intra- and inter-regional patterns and drivers of CO2 and CH4 production, as well as their link with dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity, remain poorly understood. We analyzed a range of optical characteristics and chemical variables controlling DOM and CO2 and CH4 concentrations in peatland pools across two regions with contrasting geographical properties (i.e., climate, topography, morphometry, and vegetation cover) of eastern Canada and Chilean Patagonia. We found inter-regional patterns in CO2, CH4 and DOM concentrations and composition that were coherent with patterns in mean annual temperature and precipitation, and vegetation cover. Cross-regional patterns of CO2 and CH4 were driven by morphometry, vegetation cover, and protein-like DOM composition, a proxy of high biological activity, whereas temporal variations of CO2 and CH4 concentrations were further influenced by seasonal changes in humic-like DOM composition, dissolved organic carbon and nutrients (i.e., total phosphorus and total nitrogen) concentrations, as well as pH and oxygen levels. Our results suggest that geophysical constraints associated with local peat and pool characteristics as well as climate patterns are major drivers of DOM and greenhouse gases concentrations and the links between them in broadly distributed peatland pools.

This study used field methods, statistical analysis, and the Darcy's law approach to explore surface water-groundwater dynamics, interactions, and fluxes in a geographically complex river-floodplain wetland-isolated lake system (Poyang Lake, China). The floodplain system of Poyang Lake is affected by strongly seasonal shifts between dry and wet processes that cause marked changes in surface water and groundwater flow regimes. Results indicate that wetland groundwater is more sensitive to variations in river levels than the seasonal isolated lakes. In general, groundwater levels are lower than those of the isolated lakes but slightly higher than river levels. Statistical analysis indicates that the river hydrology plays a more significant role than the isolated lakes in controlling floodplain groundwater dynamics. Overall, the river shows gaining conditions and occasionally losing conditions with highly variable Darcy fluxes of up to +0.4 and -0.2 m/day, respectively, whereas the isolated lakes are more likely to show slightly losing conditions (less than -0.1 m/day). Although seasonal flux rates range from 7.5 to 48.2 m/day for surface water-groundwater interactions in the floodplain, the flux rates for river-groundwater interactions were around four to seven times higher than that of the isolated lake-groundwater interactions. The outcomes of this study have important implications for improving the understanding of the water resources, water quality, and ecosystem functioning for both the river and the lake.

Patterns, fluctuations, drivers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A first synoptic and trans-domain overview of plankton dynamics was conducted across the aquatic sites belonging to the Italian Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER-Italy). Based on published studies, checked and complemented with unpublished information, we investigated phytoplankton and zooplankton annual dynamics and long-term changes across domains: from the large subalpine lakes to mountain lakes and artificial lakes, from lagoons to marine coastal ecosystems. This study permitted identifying common and unique environmental drivers and ecological functional processes controlling seasonal and long-term temporal course. The most relevant patterns of plankton seasonal succession were revealed, showing that the driving factors were nutrient availability, stratification regime, and freshwater inflow. Phytoplankton and mesozooplankton displayed a wide interannual variability at most sites. Unidirectional or linear long-term trends were rarely detected but all sites were impacted across the years by at least one, but in many case several major stressor(s): nutrient inputs, meteo-climatic variability at the local and regional scale, and direct human activities at specific sites. Different climatic and anthropic forcings frequently co-occurred, whereby the responses of plankton communities were the result of this environmental complexity. Overall, the LTER investigations are providing an unparalleled framework of knowledge to evaluate changes in the aquatic pelagic systems and management options.

The structuring role of submerged macrophytes in a large subtropical shallow lake: Clear effects on water chemistry and phytoplankton structure community along a vegetated-pelagic gradient	LIMNOLOGICA												It is well known that submerged macrophytes exert positive feedback effects that enhance the water transparency, stabilizing the clear-water state in shallow temperate lakes. However, the structuring effect of macrophytes on the food web of subtropical and tropical ecosystems is still poorly understood. In this study we investigated the influence of dense submerged vegetation beds on the water chemistry and phytoplankton structure along a littoral-pelagic gradient of large subtropical shallow lake in southern Brazil. Seasonal monitoring was carried throughout one year following along a submerged vegetated-pelagic transect in order to analyze the effects of macrophyte's coverage (percentage of volume infested- PVI) on the water chemistry and phytoplankton community structure. Clear variations on nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass/composition could be observed permanently along the transect. Nutrients as orto-phosphate (PO4-) and bicarbonate increased linearly towards the pelagic zone, whereas dissolved organic carbon and humic substances decreased linearly as PVI decreased. Concomitantly, a significant increase in the phytoplankton biomass was observed outwards from the submerged vegetation bed. In the vegetated area, small species (C-R strategists), unicellular flagellates were selected; whereas in the pelagic zone, larger (K-selected) species of cyanobacteria occurred, especially representatives of the functional groups M, L-o, SN, S1 and K. Such results indicate that the macrophytes and inherent metabolism, such as potential excretion of dissolved organic compounds with allelochemicals and nutrient uptake from water column influence the structure of the phytoplankton community reducing also significantly the biomass of cyanobacteria within the dense submerged vegetated zone. Because of the continuous growth of macrophytes over the year in low latitude systems, their feed-back effect pattern tends to also dictate a different role in ecosystem dynamics and structure of the food web. These findings contribute to the management and conservation of subtropical and tropical lakes.

In the present study, the coagulation performance for the removal of algae, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) was investigated systematically by central composite design (CCD) using response surface methodology (RSM). The regression models were developed to illustrate the relationships between coagulation performance and experimental variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the significance of the response surface models. It can be concluded that the major mechanisms of coagulation to remove algae and DOM were charge neutralization and sweep flocculation at a pH range of 4.66-6.34. The optimal coagulation conditions with coagulant dosage of 7.57 mg Al/L, pH of 5.42 and initial algal cell density of 3.83 x 10(6) cell/mL led to removal of 96.76%, 97.64%, 40.23% and 30.12% in term of cell density, turbidity, DOC and UV254 absorbance, respectively, which were in good agreement with the validation experimental results. A comparison between the modeling results derived through both ANOVA and artificial neural networks (ANN) based on experimental data showed a high correlation coefficient, which indicated that the models were significant and fitted well with experimental results. The results proposed a valuable reference for the treatment of algae-laden surface water in practical application by the optimal coagulation-flocculation process.

Respiration exceeds net primary production in most freshwater lakes, making them a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Driven by heterotrophic microorganisms, respiration is assumed to be unaffected by light, thus it is measured in the dark. However, photoheterotrophs, such as aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic (AAP) bacteria that produce ATP via photochemical reactions, substantially reduce respiration in the light. They are an abundant and active component of bacterioplankton, but their photoheterotrophic contribution to microbial community metabolism remains unquantified. We showed that the community respiration rate in a freshwater lake was reduced by 15.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.6-23.8%) in infrared light that is usable by AAP bacteria but not by primary producers. Moreover, significantly higher assimilation rates of glucose (18.1%; 7.8-28.4%), pyruvate (9.5%; 4.2-14.8%), and leucine (5.9%; 0.1-11.6%) were measured in infrared light. At the ecosystem scale, the amount of CO2 from respiration unbalanced by net primary production was by 3.69 x 10(9) g CO2 lower over these two sampling seasons when measured in the infrared light. Our results demonstrate that dark measurements of microbial activity significantly bias the carbon fluxes, providing a new paradigm for their quantification in aquatic environments.

J	Zohary, T; Ostrovsky, I				Zohary, Tamar; Ostrovsky, Ilia			Ecological impacts of excessive water level fluctuations in stratified freshwater lakes	INLAND WATERS												Water levels of lakes fluctuate naturally in response to climatic and hydrological forcing. Human over-exploitation of water resources leads to increased annual and interannual fluctuations of water levels, at times far beyond natural amplitudes and/or at altered time schedules. Climate change models predict increased occurrence of extreme events (flooding, extended droughts), which will further magnify the seasonal and multiannual amplitude of water level fluctuations in lakes. A relatively wide literature base already exists for shallow lakes, demonstrating that excessive water level fluctuations impair ecosystem functioning, ultimately leading to shifts between clear-water and turbid states. Evidence is gradually building in the published literature demonstrating that deep (stratified) freshwater lakes also respond adversely to excessive water level fluctuations. Analysis of existing data suggests that at moderate disturbance levels littoral habitats are affected, and hence their biota is also impacted. At further disturbance levels, ecosystem destabilization symptoms are observed, including weakening of keystone species, proliferation of nuisance and invasive species, loss of biodiversity, and increased internal nutrient loading. Ultimately, eutrophication symptoms are manifested, especially large and more frequent cyanobacterial blooms, without increased external nutrient loading. Examples from a range of subtropic and temperate freshwater lakes and reservoirs demonstrate that both top-down and bottom-up processes promote those symptoms. The response of aquatic ecosystems, particularly deep lakes, to water level fluctuations is an under-studied field of crucial importance to the management of water resources, where limnologists have a leading role to play in the near future.

Serious water shortages in the lake during the dry season has led the government to consider the establishment of a hydraulic project (PLHP) in order to remedy the deteriorating situation. However, the possible impacts of the PLHP on porpoise habitats is uncertain since the distribution of porpoise habitats during the dry season has not been sufficiently studied. Here, we combine hydrodynamic and species distribution models to simulate likely habitat and nursing area variations with or without PLHP during the dry season. Results indicate that flow velocity and distance to sand mining areas dominate the habitat preferences of the porpoise and its calves, respectively. Habitats were concentrated in the narrow channel of the Lake, which includes an area less than 10% of the lake inundation area. Under the operation of PLHP, the nursing area will increase, and the habitat will increase during September to December, but decrease during January to February. However, their proportion of the lake inundation area will decreased by 0.5% to 1.6%, and the distribution pattern will become more discontinuous. Our results suggest that the PLHP may not substantially benefit the porpoise, as it will block the only natural migration channel between Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River.

P.; Teka, Daniel			Novel approach to integrate daily satellite rainfall with in-situ rainfall, Upper Tekeze Basin, Ethiopia	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The daily rainfall is the most important and demanded input of water resources studies, challenged by typically low density and/or poor quality of in-situ observations. However, the satellite earth observation, through freely available web-based products, can provide complementary rainfall data. Such data is however, typically affected by substantial error, particularly at daily temporal resolution. Therefore, effective methods and protocols of rainfall downscaling, validation, and bias-correction are needed. The aims of this study were to: i) validate two downscaled satellite-derived daily rainfall products, CHIRPS and MPEG, against in-situ observations; ii) merge the downscaled products with in-situ observations to improve their accuracy and evaluate them to select better performing one. This study was conducted at topographically complex, Upper Tekeze Basin (UTB), separately for the wet and dry seasons, within 1 January 2015 - 31 December 2018. Validation of the products, downscaled by nearest-neighbor (NN) and bilinear (BL) methods, was carried out using descriptive statistics, categorical statistics and bias decomposition methods, introducing novel protocol with new bias indicators for each of the evaluation methods. The validation showed large biases of CHIRPS and of MPEG, larger for CHIRPS than for MPEG, larger in dry than in wet season and slightly larger for NN than for BL. To correct biases of the downscaled CHIRPS and MPEG, each was merged with the in-situ observed rainfall applying Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) algorithm and using rainfall dependence on altitude as explanatory variable. The GWR merging method substantially improved the accuracy of the MPEG and CHIRPS, with slightly better final accuracy of MPEG than of CHIRPS, better in wet than in dry season. This study confirmed that GWR-merged method could substantially reduce daily bias of satellite rainfall products, even in topographically complex areas, such as the UTB. Further improvement of the method application, can be achieved by densifying raingauge network and eventually by adding accuracy-effective explanatory variable(s).					; Lubczynski, Maciek/M-2013-2013	Gebremedhin, Mewcha Amha/0000-0002-2356-4883; Lubczynski, Maciek W./0000-0003-4242-8286													0169-8095	1873-2895				JAN 15	2021	248								105135	10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105135													WOS:000594098300007

Modeling the effects of climate change on water, sediment, and nutrient yields from the Maumee River watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Western Basin (WB) of Lake Erie have been linked to nonpoint pollution from agricultural watersheds. The Maumee River watershed is the largest in the Great Lakes region and delivers the biggest sediment and nutrient load to Lake Erie. Study focus: Climate change could alter the magnitude and timing of sediment and nutrient delivery to Lake Erie's WB. Data from four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models were inputted into a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Maumee River watershed to determine the effects of climate change on watershed yields. Tillage practices were also altered within the model to test the effectiveness of conservation practices under climate change scenarios. New hydrological insights for the region: Moderate climate change scenarios reduced annual flow (up to -24%) and sediment (up to -26%) yields, while a more extreme scenario showed smaller flow reductions (up to -10%) and an increase in sediment (up to +11%). No-till practices had a negligible effect on flow but produced 16% lower average sediment loads than scenarios using current watershed conditions. At high implementation rates, no-till practices could offset any future increases in annual sediment loads, but they may have varied seasonal success. Regardless of future climate change intensity, increased remediation efforts will likely be necessary to significantly reduce HABs in Lake Erie's WB. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL), the largest lake in the North China Plain, is confronted with such challenges. The objective of this study was to improve understanding of how changes in water level influence water quality in the BYDL at different temporal scales, especially related to implementations of intermittent environmental water allocation activities in the past two decades, by using data on monthly lake water level, climate factors of precipitation and temperature, and lake water quality. The Mann-Kendall method and continuous wavelet analysis revealed that the lake water level shows a significant decreasing trend after 1967, and the period of 16-year was identified as the principal period for 1950-2018. Based on cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analysis, the periodic agreement and coherence between water level and climatic factors decreased after 1997, when environmental water allocations started, indicating that the influences of climatic factors, i.e., precipitation and temperature, became weak. By utilizing the cross-wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analysis methods, the relationships between lake water level and water quality parameters of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were investigated. We found that the change in source and amount of environmental water allocation is one possible reason for the temporal evolution in joint variability between lake water level and water quality. Meanwhile, a dilution effect of freshwater allocated to BYDL was detected in the time-frequency domain. However, the result also indicates that the driving mechanism of water quality is complex due to the combined impacts of water allocation, nonpoint source pollution in the rainy season, and nutrient release from lake sediment. Our findings improve the general understanding of changes in water level in lakes located in arid and semiarid regions under climate change and intensive human activities, and also provide valuable knowledge for decision making in aquatic ecosystem restoration of BYDL and other similar lakes.

They are either based on visible imagery from Landsat - the Global 3-second Water Body Map (G3WBM) and the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) - or on the merging of passive/active microwave and visible observations - Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellite (GIEMS-D3) - that has been downscaled from a native resolution of 25 km x 25 km to the 90 m x 90 m resolution. The objective of this paper is to perform a thorough comparison of the different water surface estimates in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and propose a strategy for future developments of high-resolution surface water databases. Results show that due to their very high spatial resolution (30 m) the Landsat-based datasets are well suited to retrieve open water surfaces, even at very small size. GIEMS-D3 has a better ability to detect water under vegetation and during the cloudy season, and it shows larger seasonal dynamics. However, its current version overestimates surface water extent on water-saturated soils, and due to its low original (i.e. before downscaling) spatial resolution, it is under-performing at detecting small water bodies. The permanent waters for G3WBM, GSWE, GIEMS-D3 and GLWD represent respectively: 2.76, 2.05, 3.28, and 3.04 million km(2). The transitory waters shows larger discrepancies: 0.48, 3.72, 10.39 and 8.81 million km(2). Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (from ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT), Sentinel and soon the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT)) would be a good complementary information because they have a high nominal spatial resolution and are less sensitive to clouds than visible measurements. However, global SAR datasets are still not available due to difficulties in developing a retrieval scheme adequate at the global scale. In order to improve our estimates of global wetland extents at high resolution and over long-term records, three interim lines of action are proposed: (1) extend the temporal record of GIEMS-D3 to exploit the full time series of microwave observations (from 1978 to present), (2) develop an approach to fuse the GSWE and GIEMS-D3 datasets leveraging the strengths of both, and (3) prepare for the release of SAR global datasets.					; Yamazaki, Dai/J-3029-2012; Fluet-Chouinard, Etienne/KIH-8576-2024; Lehner, Bernhard/CAF-2153-2022; Aires, Filipe/JYP-4578-2024; Prigent, Catherine/ABF-7175-2020; Papa, Fabrice/D-3695-2009	Aires, Filipe/0000-0002-9426-866X; Fluet-Chouinard, Etienne/0000-0003-4380-2153; Yamazaki, Dai/0000-0002-6478-1841; Lehner, Bernhard/0000-0003-3712-2581; Papa, Fabrice/0000-0001-6305-6253													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2018	216						427	441		10.1016/j.rse.2018.06.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.06.015													WOS:000445990100030

Temporal and spatial dynamics in microbial community composition within a temperate stream network	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The water column of streams hosts a unique microbial community that is distinct from the microbial communities of the stream benthos and surrounding soil. This community is shaped by complex interacting forces, including microbial dispersal from surrounding environments and in-stream selection. However, how the processes structuring stream communities change over space and time remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterize spatial and temporal trends in microbial community composition throughout a stream network spanning first through fifth order streams. We found that the microbial communities of headwater streams are compositionally diverse, with low representation of freshwater microbial taxa and high representation of soil and sediment-associated taxa. In three out of five seasonal samplings, a successional pattern was identified in which phylotype richness and compositional heterogeneity decreased while the proportion of known freshwater taxa increased with increasing cumulative upstream dendritic distance. However, in two samplings, streams instead exhibited uniformly high microbial diversity across the watershed, and the fraction of freshwater taxa showed no relationship with dendritic distance. Overall, our data suggest that the successional processes that drive microbial diversity in streams are highly dynamic and can be disrupted at landscape scales, potentially in response to variation in temperature and precipitation.

For alpine lakes, which are exposed to both exacerbated atmospheric warming and intense episodic weather events, future conditions might not be appropriately forecast by only climate change trends, i.e. warming, if extreme events have the potential to deflect their thermal and metabolic states from their seasonal ranges. We used high-frequency monitoring data over three open-water seasons with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the high-altitude Lake Muzelle (France) to show that rainstorms or windstorms, notwithstanding their intensity, did not trigger long-lasting consequences to the lake characteristics when light penetration into the lake was not modified. In contrast, storms associated with high turbidity input from the watershed (turbid storms) strongly modified the lacustrine hydrodynamics and metabolism for the rest of the open-water season through reduced light penetration. The long-lasting effects of turbid storms were related to the inputs and in-lake persistence of very light glacial suspensoids from the watershed. The occurrence of the observed turbid storms was not related to the wind or rain intensities during the events. Instead, the turbid storms occurred after dry and atypically warm spells, i.e. meteorological conditions expected to be more frequent in this alpine region in the upcoming decades. Consequently, storm events, notwithstanding their intensity, are expected to strongly imprint the future ecological status of alpine lakes under climate warming.

J	Tegegne, G; Kim, YO				Tegegne, Getachew; Kim, Young-Oh			Representing inflow uncertainty for the development of monthly reservoir operations using genetic algorithms	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been commonly applied in the last two decades as a substitute for the traditional mathematical programming algorithms in searching for optimal operating rules of reservoir systems. However, only a few GA studies related to reservoir operations addressed the inflow uncertainty. In this study, the reservoir operation rules were developed and evaluated by reflecting the uncertainty of reservoir inflows using the non-dominated sorting GA II algorithm (NSGA-II) through the following procedure: (1) the historical inflow data were classified into four clusters using the self-organizing map (SOM) clustering technique; (2) NSGA-II searched for an optimal release rule in each cluster with all the inflow data of the corresponding cluster; (3) a release response function was then derived for each cluster by regressing the calculated optimal release data against the storage at the beginning of the month and the inflow during the month; and (4) finally, the derived release rules for each cluster were tested with three performance indices, namely, reliability, resilience, and vulnerability. The proposed procedure was applied to the monthly operations of the Lake Tana multi-reservoir system in Ethiopia, which has six upstream irrigation reservoirs and one natural lake that has three release outlets for agriculture, hydropower, and instream requirement. Using the NSGA-II, SOM, and a seasonal ARIMA forecasting model in this study, it is concluded that 1) the overall performance of the proposed optimization procedure with ARIMA forecasts and cluster approach reaches 84% of the perfect information case across multiple performance measures; 2) the use of the one-month-ahead ARIMA forecasts improves the overall system performance by 8% over simply optimizing to the mean flow; and 3) the use of the four clusters and the consequent RRFs further improves the overall system performance by 14%. Furthermore, this study recommends that, in future, significant efforts should be focused on improving the operation performance of the upstream irrigation reservoirs in coordination with the Lake Tana system.					; Damtew, Getachew/MVV-6755-2025	Tegegne, Getachew/0000-0002-7557-5699; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2020	586								124876	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124876													WOS:000544258100038
J	Castillo, MM				Castillo, Maria M.			Suspended sediment, nutrients, and chlorophyll in tropical floodplain lakes with different patterns of hydrological connectivity	LIMNOLOGICA												The ecological functioning of floodplain lakes is largely influenced by the interaction with the river mainstem. In this study, seasonal variation in water chemistry and the relationship with the river conditions were compared between floodplain lakes that differ in the level of connection to the Usumacinta River, the largest river of Mesoamerica. Samples for suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were collected through the year in lakes permanently connected to the river and in lakes that only received water from the Usumacinta for a short period during peak flow. Floodplain lakes showed higher total suspended solids than the river during the dry season while during the rainy season greater differences were observed between the river and the lakes, probably explained by higher concentrations in the river and greater sedimentation in the lakes. Greater organic matter content in the suspended solids was observed in the floodplain lakes, particularly in the more isolated lakes, likely related to high algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations were always higher in the river than in the lakes and lower nitrate concentrations occurred at the isolated lakes, suggesting that processes that remove nitrate occur through the year and are a common feature of floodplain lakes. Phosphorus in the connected lakes was higher than in the river only during the dry season, while in the isolated lakes concentrations were always greater than in the river. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in the connected lakes than in the river only during the dry season, while the more isolated lakes exhibited higher values through the year, showing signs of eutrophication. Suspended organic matter, nitrate, and chlorophyll showed larger differences between lake and river sites in the more isolated lakes, probably related to greater water residence time and its influence on primary production. Less connected lakes are more vulnerable to flow alteration because the brief period of connection to the river can be compromised and the effects of eutrophication exacerbated.

Here, we examine the three-dimensional structure of the tropopause LSMPs in terms of circulation and factors relevant to precipitation, including moisture, stability, and synoptic mechanisms associated with lifting. Within each pattern, the link between the different factors and extreme precipitation is further investigated by comparing the relative strength of the factors between days with and without the occurrence of extreme precipitation. The six tropopause LSMPs include two ridge patterns, two eastern US troughs, and two troughs centered over the Ohio Valley, with a strong seasonality associated with each pattern. Extreme precipitation in the ridge patterns is associated with both convective mechanisms (instability combined with moisture transport from the Great Lakes and Western Atlantic) and synoptic forcing related to Great Lakes storm tracks and embedded shortwaves. Extreme precipitation associated with eastern US troughs involves intense southerly moisture transport and strong quasi-geostrophic forcing of vertical velocity. Ohio Valley troughs are associated with warm fronts and intense warm conveyor belts that deliver large amounts of moisture ahead of storms, but little direct quasi-geostrophic forcing. Factors that show the largest difference between days with and without extreme precipitation include integrated moisture transport, low-level moisture convergence, warm conveyor belts, and quasi-geostrophic forcing, with the relative importance varying between patterns.					; Binder, Hanin/C-9065-2017; Catto, Jennifer/B-3637-2013; Binder, Hanin Verena/C-9065-2017	Barlow, Mathew/0000-0002-7612-3811; Catto, Jennifer/0000-0002-8662-1398; Binder, Hanin Verena/0000-0003-3001-1344													0930-7575	1432-0894				FEB	2019	52	3-4					1739	1760		10.1007/s00382-018-4223-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4223-2													WOS:000460902200026

In this study, we explored the key driving forces responsible for the succession between surface and subsurface cyanobacteria using ecological niche modelling based upon a case study in Miyun Reservoir, China. The results suggest a negative effect of water depth and surface light irradiance (I-0) on subsurface Planktothrix sp. growth (p-values < 0.001), and a unimodal effect of surface water temperature (T-0) with the optimum at 23 degrees C (p-value < 0.001). While the surface Microcystis spp. shows a strong positive relationship with temperature (T-0; p-value < 0.001), and significant effects for the interaction between T-0 and I-0 (p- value < 0.01). In addition, we identified the extent and type of interaction between subsurface and surface cyanobacteria and conclude that the high irradiance surface water combined with sufficient nutrients at the pre-bloom stage are key factors responsible for the preferential growth of surface cyanobacteria, while the gradual decline of the surface cyanobacteria in post-bloom stage is associated with nutrient reduction. This decline and loss of surface populations enhanced underwater irradiance and thus promoted the growth and allowed for succession of subsurface cyanobacteria in deeper layers where the nutrient supply was still adequate. Based upon this, the growth potentials for the subsurface and surface cyanobacteria are different under different environmental conditions: the subsurface cyanobacteria have greater growth potential than surface cyanobacteria in shallow oligotrophic and deep eutrophic reservoirs during median light irrigation seasons.

However, one of the most important water color sensors, the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), has not been applied to the study of turbid or eutrophic lakes. In this study, we developed a new soft-classification-based C-chla, estimation method using MERIS data for the highly turbid and eutrophic Taihu Lake. We first developed a decision tree to classify Taihu Lake into three optical water types (OWTs) using MERIS reflectance data, which were quasi-synchronous (+/- 3 h) with in situ measured C-chla, data from 91 sample stations. Secondly, we used MERIS reflectance and in situ measured Ca. data in each OWT to calibrate the optimal C-chla, estimation model for each OWT. We then developed a soft classification -based C-chla estimation method, which blends the C-chla , estimation results in each OWT by a weighted average, where the weight for each MERIS spectra in each OWT is the reciprocal value of the spectral angle distance between the MERIS spectra and the centroid spectra of the OWT. Finally, the soft-classification based Cad. estimation algorithm was validated and compared with no-classification and hard-classification based methods by the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. The soft-classification-based method exhibited the best performance, with a correlation coefficient (R-2), average relative error (ARE), and root-mean square error (RMSE) of 0.81, 33.8%, and 7.0 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, the soft- classification-based method displayed smooth values at the edges of OWT boundaries, which resolved the main problem with the hard-classification-based method. The seasonal and annual variations of Cath, were computed in Taihu Lake from 2003 to 2011, and agreed with the results of previous studies, further indicating the stability of the algorithm. We therefore propose that the soft-classification-based method can be effectively used in Taihu Lake, and that it has the potential for use in other optically-similar turbid and eutrophic lakes, and using spectrally-similar satellite sensors.

Species sorting and neutral processes are both important during the initial assembly of bacterial communities	ISME JOURNAL												Many studies have shown that species sorting, that is, the selection by local environmental conditions is important for the composition and assembly of bacterial communities. On the other hand, there are other studies that could show that bacterial communities are neutrally assembled. In this study, we implemented a microcosm experiment with the aim to determine, at the same time, the importance of species sorting and neutral processes for bacterial community assembly during the colonisation of new, that is, sterile, habitats, by atmospheric bacteria. For this we used outdoor microcosms, which contained sterile medium from three different rock pools representing different environmental conditions, which were seeded by rainwater bacteria. We found some evidence for neutral assembly processes, as almost every 4th taxon growing in the microcosms was also detectable in the rainwater sample irrespective of the medium. Most of these taxa belonged to widespread families with opportunistic growth strategies, such as the Pseudomonadaceae and Comamonadaceae, indicating that neutrally assembled taxa may primarily be generalists. On the other hand, we also found evidence for species sorting, as one out of three media selected a differently composed bacterial community. Species sorting effects were relatively weak and established themselves via differences in relative abundance of generalists among the different media, as well as media-specific occurrences of a few specific taxa. In summary, our results suggest that neutral and species sorting processes interact during the assembly of bacterial communities and that their importance may differ depending on how many generalists and specialists are present in a community.

We used satellite data on atmospheric methane concentrations to retrieve information about methane emission in permafrost and non-permafrost environments in Siberia with different biogeochemical conditions in river valleys, thermokarst lakes, wetlands, and lowlands. We evaluated the statistical links with air temperature, precipitation, depth of seasonal thawing, and freezing and developed a statistical model. We demonstrated that by the mid-21st century methane emission in Siberian permafrost regions will increase by less than 20 Tg year(-1), which is at the lower end of other estimates. Such changes will lead to less than 0.02 degrees C global temperature rise. These findings do not support the "methane bomb" concept. They demonstrate that the feedback between thawing Siberian wetlands and the global climate has been significantly overestimated.					; Zimov, Sergey/JCD-7517-2023	Zimov, Sergey/0000-0002-0053-6599; 													0044-7447	1654-7209				NOV	2021	50	11			SI		2050	2059		10.1007/s13280-020-01392-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-020-01392-y		NOV 2020						33140207					WOS:000584344800001

In June and September 2020, eleven SMCs and nineteen siloxanes were measured in water, sediments, and biota. Samples were collected from two sites where levels were expected to be influenced by the distance from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the Geum River, Republic of Korea, were expected. High concentrations of SMCs and siloxanes entered through WWTP were measured in water, sediment, and biota at the both sites and both seasons. The delta N-15 of amino acids provided a high-resolution food web and accurate trophic position (TP), which is an important factor for determining the trophic magnification factor (TMF). Among 24 TMFs, 19 of them were <1, ranging 0.7-0.8 for 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-cyclopenta-gamma-2-benzopyran (HHCB), 0.6-0.8 for 6-Acetyl-1,1,2,4,4,7-hexamethyltetralin (AHTN), 0.7-0.8 for 4-tert-Butyl-3,5-dinitro-2,6-dimethylacetophenone (MK), 0.7-0.9 for octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), 0.1-0.4 for decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5), and 0.04-0.8 for dodecamethylcyclo hexasiloxane (D6), and the remaining ones including HHCB, AHTN, MK, and D4 showed values close to 1 or slightly higher (TMF range: 1.0-2.3) indicating no or a little trophic magnification. The TMFs of these compounds were constant across sites and seasons. The TMF values of PCPs might be affected by species specificity and food web structure rather than by chemical properties such as log K-ow, which describes a wide range of TMF values in various environments. This study presents valuable implications for assessing risk and managing environmental fate and trophic transfer of SMCs and siloxanes in freshwater environments.

In our study of four lakes, the lowest gamma (gamma) diversity was recorded in January 2017, with a total of 25 zooplankton taxa. The highest y diversity was recorded in May 2016, with a total of 55 zooplankton taxa. Species turnover in space (beta) were from 14.98 to 25.81. Markedly temporal and spatial variations were observed in the zooplankton community. The higher mean cladocera density (57.70 ind. L-1 and 39.85 ind. L-1) was observed in May and August, then decreased gradually with the lowest in January. The mean copepoda density ranged from 8.71 ind. L-1 in January 2017 to 32.04 ind. L-1 in August 2016. The mean rotifera density was significantly higher than that of the other two crustacean zooplankton (p < 0.01), within the range of 89.36-1139.2 ind. L-1. We also observed that zooplankton density exhibited significant seasonal changes from NMDS (Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis). Redundancy analysis revealed that environmental factors, such as water temperature and transparency, have significantly influenced the zooplankton community structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Miguez-Macho, G; Fan, Y				Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo; Fan, Ying			The role of groundwater in the Amazon water cycle: 1. Influence on seasonal streamflow, flooding and wetlands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Observational studies across the Amazon report a common occurrence of shallow water table in lowland valleys and groundwater-surface water exchange from small headwater catchments to large floodplains. In this study, we assess groundwater's role in the Amazon surface water dynamics using a continental-scale coupled groundwater-surface water model (LEAF-Hydro-Flood) forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis, at 2 km and 4 min resolution over 11 years (2000-2010). The simulation is validated with observed streamflow, water table depth and flooding extent. A parallel simulation without groundwater is conducted to isolate its effect. Our findings support the following hypotheses. First, in the headwater catchments, groundwater dominates streamflow; the observed variations in its dominance across the Amazon can be explained by the varying water table depth. Second, over large floodplains, there are two-way exchanges between floodwater and groundwater as infiltration in the wet season and seepage in the dry season, and the direction and magnitude are controlled by the water table depth. Third, the Amazon harbors large areas of wetlands that are rarely under floodwater and difficult to observe by remote sensing, but are maintained by a persistently shallow water table. Fourth, due to its delayed and muted response to rainfall, groundwater seepage persists in the dry season, buffering surface waters through seasonal droughts. Our simulations shed new lights on the spatial-temporal structures of the hidden subsurface hydrologic pathways across the Amazon and suggest possible mechanisms whereby groundwater actively participates in the Amazon water-carbon cycle such as CO2 outgassing from groundwater seeps and CH4 emission from groundwater-supported wetlands.

J	Zhou, YZ; Li, X; Yang, K; Zhou, J				Zhou, Yanzhao; Li, Xin; Yang, Kun; Zhou, Jian			Assessing the impacts of an ecological water diversion project on water consumption through high-resolution estimations of actual evapotranspiration in the downstream regions of the Heihe River Basin, China	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Ecological Water Diversion Projects (EWDPs) have been implemented in several endorheic river basins in the arid region of northwest China since the beginning of the new millennium to restore the deteriorated ecosystems. However, the effects of these EWDPs are difficult to evaluate quantitatively. Here, we assessed changes in water use in Ejin Oasis in the downstream region of the Heihe River Basin, which is a typical endorheic river basin in northwest China, based on the estimated evapotranspiration (ET) during the growing season (May to October) in 2000 (before the EWDP) and 2014 (after the EWDP). The ET estimates were based on the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land (M-SEBAL) model and Landsat images. The estimated ET was validated against observations using eddy covariance towers installed on different landscapes in 2014 and was found to have a root mean square error of 1.20 mm day(-1) and a coefficient of determination of 0.67 at the footprint scale on satellite overpass days. The estimated ETs in two years were also compared with another remote sensing product that showed a similar spatial pattern, with a spatial mean difference of 4 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The estimated ET was then used to evaluate the impact of the EWDP on water consumption. The ET over different land use and land cover types increased, with a mean increase of 52% over the 15 years of the implementation of the EWDP in Ejin Oasis. The water consumption in Ejin Oasis in 2014 was approximately twice that in 2000. Among the changes, water consumption by croplands increased significantly, with a maximum increase of 264% because of cropland expansion and increased ET. The increases in water consumption by forests and grasslands were 60% and 25%, respectively. The lake area expanded drastically (from 0 to 37.46 km(2)), and the corresponding water consumption caused by evaporation was zero in 2000 and approximately 3.9 x 10(7) m(3) from May to October in 2014. This work demonstrates that estimates of the ET based on remote sensing can be used as reliable indicators for comprehensive assessments of the impacts of the EWDPs.

Harvesting invasive plants to reduce nutrient loads and produce bioenergy: an assessment of Great Lakes coastal wetlands	ECOSPHERE												In Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands (GLCWs), dominant emergent invasive plants are expanding their ranges and compromising the unique habitat and ecosystem service values that these ecosystems provide. Herbiciding and burning to control invasive plants have not been effective in part because neither strategy addresses the most common root cause of invasion, nutrient enrichment. Mechanical harvesting is an alternative approach that removes tissue-bound phosphorus and nitrogen and can increase wetland plant diversity and aquatic connectivity between wetland and lacustrine systems. In this study, we used data from three years of Great Lakes-wide wetland plant surveys, published literature, and bioenergy analyses to quantify the overall areal extent of GLCWs, the extent and biomass of the three most dominant invasive plants, the pools of nitrogen and phosphorus contained within their biomass, and the potential for harvesting this biomass to remediate nutrient runoff and produce renewable energy. Of the approximately 212,000 ha of GLCWs, three invasive plants (invasive cattail, common reed, and reed canary grass) dominated 76,825 ha (36%). The coastal wetlands of Lake Ontario exhibited the highest proportion of invasive dominance (57%) of any of the Great Lakes, primarily from cattail. A single growing season's biomass of these invasive plants across all GLCWs was estimated at 659,545 metric tons: 163,228 metric tons of reed canary grass, 270,474 metric tons of common reed, and 225,843 metric tons of invasive cattail, and estimated to contain 10,805 and 1144 metric tons of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. A one-time harvest and utilization for energy of this biomass would provide the gross equivalent of 1.8 million barrels of oil if combusted, or 0.9 million barrels of oil if converted to biogas in an anaerobic digester. We discuss the potential for mitigating non-point source nutrient pollution with invasive wetland plant removal, and other potential uses for the harvested biomass, including compost and direct application to agricultural soils. Finally, we describe the research and adaptive management program we have built around this concept, and point to current limitations to the implementation of large-scale invasive plant harvesting.																			2150-8925					JUN	2018	9	6							e02320	10.1002/ecs2.2320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2320													WOS:000439997600032

However, the relationship between the main root-shoot morphological indexes and biomass allocation of inland alpine arid area salt marsh plant is still unclear. According to the difference of the habitat conditions of Saussurea salsa, 3 test sample were set up, plot I (the Inland salt marsh area, 200-500 m from the lakeshore), plot II (the Oasis Wetland area, 500-1000 m from the lakeshore), plot III (the Seasonal river wetland area, 1000-1500 m from the lakeshore). The relationship between the main rootshoot morphological characteristics and biomass allocation of Saussurea salsa in the Sugan Lake salt marsh was studied in response to heterogeneous habitats. The results showed that Saussurea salsa tended to form the large and thick leaf pattern, the root morphological construction pattern with moderate root diameter (RD) and specific root length (SRL), and the root-shoot ratio (RSR) with minimum biomass allocation strategy in plot I. In plot II, the thin-leaf pattern with the largest specific leaf area (SLA) and the smallest thickness (LT) was formed. Meanwhile, the slender root morphology pattern with the smallest RD, the largest SRL and the moderate RSR was preferred. In plot III, a lobular pattern with minimum leaf area (LA) and SLA, and moderate thickness was formed. At the same time, a thick root pattern with maximum RD and minimum root length, and a maximum RSR were formed. Moreover, there was a highly significant negative correlation (p < 0.01) between SLA and RD at three plots. Besides, there appeared a less significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between LA and LT, shoot biomass at three plots. Through the synergistic changes of morphological characteristics of aboveground and underground organs and biomass allocation strategies, the inland salt marsh plant population can maintain normal survival, growth and reproduction under harsh environment, which reflects its morphological plasticity and stress resistance mechanism under heterogeneous environment.

Fish growth and degree-days I: selecting a base temperature for a within-population study	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Degree-days (DD) are an increasingly popular method for explaining variation in fish growth and development.

T-o determine how T-o affects the ability of DD T-o explain within-population growth variation, we first show that the ability of DD T-o describe a growing season is robust T-o low values of T-o. We then analyze immature length data from eight species and 85 water bodies in North America T-o show that there is a broad range of T-o values that effectively explain growth variation. Based on these results, we argue that precise T-o estimates are unwarranted for most single-population studies and recommend standard T-o values (0, 5, 10, 15 degrees C). Standardization facilitates comparative studies and promotes the use of DD in future research. To this end, we provide equations for converting annual DD at a given T-o to annual DD at a standard T-o.

AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Several high nitrogen use efficiency (high-NUE) rice cultivars have been developed to meet the increased food demand and urgent environmental concerns, but the effect of these cultivars on reducing N losses from paddy fields is not well documented. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the Taihu Lake region of China to evaluate the advantages of high-NUE rice on yields and N losses in 2011 and 2012. Two "high-NUE" rice cultivars and a conventional cultivar were compared at the same fertilizer N input of 200 kg N ha(-1). Ammonia (NH3) volatilization, N2O emission, N leaching and runoff losses were monitored during the entire rice growing season within a rice wheat rotation. The high-NUE rice cultivars Wuyunjing 23 (W23) and Zhendao 11 (Z11) achieved higher grain yields, and took up more N with a higher NUE than the conventional cultivar Wuyujing 3 (W3). There was a trend toward smaller N losses with the high-NUE cultivars W23 and 111 (N leaching, N2O emissions and NH3 volatilization decreased by 12-23%, 5-10% and 2-8%, respectively), but the total reductions for the growing season compared to W3 were not statistically significant. Even though the high-NUE cultivars did not significantly decrease the absolute losses of N from the field, they did show lower N losses expressed on a yield-scaled basis than the conventional cultivar due to higher grain yields. Cultivars W23 and Z11 produced 21-27% less NH3 volatilization, 23-26% less N2O emission, 23-33% less N leaching, and 13-24% less N in runoff per ton of rice grain harvested than those of W3. Another cultivar Aoyusi 386 (A386), known to have a higher N uptake at early growth stages than W23 and Z11 was also planted in 2012. This cultivar significantly reduced N losses compared with the conventional variety. It was concluded that improving N uptake rate of high-NUE cultivars in the early stages of growth would be most effective in decreasing N losses and that the main part of N fertilizer applications should be later in the growing season than is currently practiced in the region.

Cyanotoxins accumulate in Lake St. Clair fish yet their fillets are safe to eat	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Consuming fish exposed to cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (HABs) may be a major route of microcystin toxin ex-posure to humans. However, it remains unknown whether fish can accumulate and retain microcystins temporally in waterbodies with recurring seasonal HABs, particularly before and after a HAB event when fishing is active. We con-ducted a field study on Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Rock Bass, Walleye, White Bass, and Yellow Perch to assess the human health risks to microcystin toxicity via fish consumption. We collected 124 fish in 2016 and 2018 from Lake St. Clair, a large freshwater ecosystem in the North American Great Lakes that is actively fished pre-and post-HAB periods. Muscles were analyzed using the 2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid (MMPB) Lemieux Oxidation method for total microcystins, which was used to perform a human health risk assessment for comparison against fish consumption advisory benchmarks available for Lake St. Clair. From this collection 35 fish livers were ad-ditionally extracted to confirm the presence of microcystins. Microcystins were detected in all livers at widely varying concentrations (1-1500 ng g-1 ww), suggesting HABs are an underappreciated and pervasive stressor to fish popula-tions. Conversely, microcystin levels were consistently low in muscles (0-15 ng g-1 ww) and presented negligible risk, empirically supporting that fillets may be safely consumed before and after HAB events following fish consumption advisories.

The northern Hangzhou Bay is under intensifying impact of anthropogenic activities. To reveal the heavy metal pollution status in the coastal environment of the Hangzhou Bay, a long-term investigation into the heavy metal contamination during 2011 to 2016 was initiated. Seawater and sediment samples of 25 locations depending on the sewage outlet locations in the northern Hangzhou Bay were collected to analyze the concentrations and temporal and spatial distribution of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg, and As. Pollution condition, ecological risk, and potential sources were additionally analyzed. Results show that the annual mean concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg, and As were 2.13-4.59, 0.212-1.480, 7.81-20.34, 0.054-0.279, 0.026-0.090, and 1.08-2.57 mu g/L in the seawater, and were 16.34-28.35, 16.25-26.33, 67.32-97.61, 0.084-0.185, 0.029-0.061, and 6.09-14.08 mu g/L in the sediments. A decreasing trend in Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg concentrations and an increasing trend in As of the seawater were observed. However, in the sediment, the heavy metals demonstrated a rising trend, except for Hg. The single-factor pollution index showed an increasing trend in Cd and As in the seawater, depicting an enhanced pollution of Cd and As, while in the sediments, Cu, Pb, and As were in pollution-free level (average Geo-accumulation index (I-geo) values below 0) in general, and only occasional slight pollution occurred in individual years, e.g., As with 0.403 in 2016. The mean I-geo values of Cd ranged from - 0.865 to 0.274 during 2011 to 2016, indicating that the pollution level of Cd was slight, but is likely to increase in the forthcoming years. The level of heavy metal contamination in sediments was low in 2011 (5.853) and 2012 (5.172), and moderate during 2013 to 2016 (in the range of 6.107 to 7.598), while the degree of potential ecological risk was low in the study period, except moderate in 2013 (125.107). The highest contamination degree and potential ecological risk appeared in 2013 (Cd = 7.598; RI = 125.107), while Cd and Hg contributed over 75% of the ecological risk. Overall, the results show low pollution level and low potential ecological risk in the northern Hangzhou Bay; however, more attention should be paid to the potential ecological risk due to Hg and Cd.

However, the distribution of DBC in water environment especially in source water is not clear and as an important component of DOM, whether DBC can produce disinfection byproducts (DBPs) like other DOM during disinfection remains unknown. In this study, the DBC concentrations in seventeen source water samples from East China were measured. The concentrations of DBC in the source water samples ranged from 60 to 270 mu g/L, which were positively correlated with UV254 absorbance and chemical oxygen demand. The levels of DBC in wet season were higher than that in dry season. The average concentrations of DBC in different types of source water samples followed the order of reservoir > canal > lake > river. DBC could only be removed by 20% during the simulated coagulation, and further generate different categories of DBPs during chlorination, among which the concentrations of haloacetic acids (HAA) were the highest. The results indicated that DBC widely distributes in source water and is an important precursor of HAAs and THMs during chlorination.					wang, yuting/KIK-0235-2024; Wang, Junjie/AAQ-3098-2021; Chen, Haoran/AAN-3251-2020; 黄, 小志/GSE-5649-2022; zhao, Xiating/ONJ-1144-2025														0304-3894	1873-3336				AUG 5	2022	435								129054	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129054								35650743					WOS:000895321800008
J	Yang, P; He, QH; Huang, JF; Tong, C				Yang, Ping; He, Qinghua; Huang, Jiafang; Tong, Chuan			Fluxes of greenhouse gases at two different aquaculture ponds in the coastal zone of southeastern China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Shallow water ponds are important contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes into the atmosphere. Aquaculture ponds cover an extremely large area in China's entire coastal zone. Knowledge of greenhouse gas fluxes from aquaculture ponds is very limited, but measuring GHG fluxes from aquaculture ponds is fundamental for estimating their impact on global warming. This study investigated the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from two coastal aquaculture ponds during 2011 and 2012 in the Shanyutan wetland of the Min River estuary, southeastern China, and determined the factors that may regulate GHG fluxes from the two ponds. The average fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were 20.78 mgCO(2) m(-2) h(-1), 19.95 mgCH(4) m(-2)h(-1) and 10.74 mu gN(2)O m(-2) respectively, in the shrimp pond. The average fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were 60.46 mgCO(2) m(-2)h(-1), 1.65 mgCH(4)m(-2) h(-1) and 11.8 mu gN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), respectively, in the mixed shrimp and fish aquaculture pond during the study period. The fluxes of all three gases showed distinct temporal variations. The variations in the GHG fluxes were influenced by interactions with the thermal regime, pH, trophic status and chlorophyll-a content. Significant differences in the CO2 and N2O fluxes between the shrimp pond and the mixed aquaculture pond were observed from September to November, whereas the CH4 fluxes from the two ponds were not significantly different. The difference in the CO2 flux likely was related to the effects of photosynthesis, biological respiration and the mineralization of organic matter, whereas the N2O fluxes were controlled by the interactions between nitrogen substrate availability and pH. Water salinity, trophic status and dissolved oxygen concentration likely affected CH4 emission. Our results suggest that subtropical coastal aquaculture ponds are important contributors to regional CH4 and N2O emissions into the atmosphere, and their contribution to global warming must be considered. Furthermore, we also suggest that aquaculture pond type should be considered when evaluating regional GHG budgets in coastal aquaculture ponds. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We show significant increases in surface-water temperature (similar to 0.5 degrees C decade(-1); > 0.2% year(-1)) and wave power (>1% year(-1); the transport of energy by waves) associated with atmospheric phenomena (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Multivariate El Nirio/Southern Oscillation) in the month of August between 1980 and 2018 in the Laurentian Great Lakes. A pattern in wave power, in response to extreme winds, was identified as a proxy to predict interbasin coupling in Lake Erie. This involved the upwelling of cold and hypoxic (dissolved oxygen <2 mg L-1) hypolimnetic water containing high total phosphorus concentration from the seasonally stratified central basin into the normally well-mixed western basin opposite to the eastward flow. Analysis of historical records indicate that hypoxic events due to interbasin exchange have increased in the western basin over the last four decades (43% in the last 10 years) thus affecting the water quality of the one of the world's largest freshwater sources and fisheries.

Correlations between the heterotrophic bacterial and cyanobacterial communities in the estuarine ecosystem were also investigated. Significant spatial and temporal changes were observed in the microbial community composition at all sites. These differences were mainly reflected on the variations of bacterial relative abundance. The modularity analysis on the network indicate that bacterial community response to the variations of environmental factors in the form of co-occurrence/exclusion patterns. In warm season, Synechococcus spp. being the dominant Cyanobacteria taxa exhibited high relative abundance in the reservoir. Water temperature was the critical driver for the proliferation of Synechococcus. Moreover, heterotrophic bacteria belonging to Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria), Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi, exhibited positive correlations with Synechococcus. The co-occurrence of these bacterial OTUs suggests that specific taxa may benefit from the proliferation of Synechococcus. In cold season, bacterial OTUs belonging to Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes shown co-occurrence pattern with salt ions (including K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl- and SO42-) inside the reservoir. In conclusion, further research is required to investigate the ecological functions of these taxa in estuarine ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Fully Automated Supraglacial lake area and volume Tracking("FAST") algorithm: Development and application using MODIS imagery of West Greenland	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) influence ice dynamics if they drain rapidly by hydrofracture. MODIS data are often used to investigate SGLs, including calculating SGL area changes through time, but no existing work presents a method that tracks changes to individual (and total) SGL volume in MODIS imagery over a melt season. Here, we develop such a method by first testing three automated approaches to derive SGL areas from MODIS images from the MOD09 level-2 surface-reflectance product, by comparing calculated areas for the Paakitsoq and Store Glacier regions in West Greenland with areas derived from Landsat-8 (LS8) images. Second, we apply a physically-based depth-calculation algorithm to the pixels within the SGL boundaries from the best performing area-derivation method, and compare the resultant depths with those calculated using the same method applied to LS8 imagery. Our results indicate that SGL areas are most accurately generated using dynamic thresholding of MODIS band 1 (red) MOD09 data with a 0.640 threshold value; calculated values from MODIS are closely comparable to those derived from LS8. Third, we incorporate the best performing area- and depth-detection methods into a Fully Automated SGL Tracking ("FAST") algorithm that tracks individual SGLs between successive MODIS images. Finally, we apply the FAST algorithm to the two study regions, where it identifies 43 (Paakitsoq) and 19 (Store Glacier) rapidly draining SGLs during 2014, representing 21% and 15% of the respective total SGL populations, including some clusters of rapidly draining SGLs. The FAST algorithm improves upon existing automatic SGL tracking methods through its calculation of both SGL areas and volumes over large regions of the GrIS on a fully automatic basis. It therefore has the potential to be used for investigating statistical relationships between SGL areas, volumes and drainage events over the whole of the GrIS, and over multiple seasons, which might provide further insights into the factors that trigger rapid SGL drainage.

An integrated Structure-from-Motion and time-lapse technique for quantifying ice-margin dynamics	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Fine resolution topographic data derived from methods such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) have the potential to provide detailed observations of geomorphological change, but have thus far been limited by the logistical constraints of conducting repeat surveys in the field. Here, we present the results from an automated time-lapse camera array, deployed around an ice-marginal lake on the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet. Fifteen cameras acquired imagery three-times per day over a 426 day period, yielding a dataset of similar to 19 000 images. From these data we derived 18 point clouds of the ice-margin across a range of seasons and successfully identified calving events (ranging from 234 to 1475 m(2) in area and 815-8725 m(3) in volume) induced by ice cliff undercutting at the waterline and the collapse of spalling flakes. Low ambient light levels, locally reflective surfaces and the large survey range hindered analysis of smaller scale ice-margin dynamics. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that an integrated SfM-MVS and time-lapse approach can be employed to generate long-term 3-D topographic datasets and thus quantify ice-margin dynamics at a fine spatio-temporal scale. This approach provides a template for future studies of geomorphological change.

J	Blindow, I; Hargeby, A; Hilt, S				Blindow, Irmgard; Hargeby, Anders; Hilt, Sabine			Facilitation of clear-water conditions in shallow lakes by macrophytes: differences between charophyte and angiosperm dominance	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A number of mechanisms result in a feedback between water clarity and macrophytes and, consequently, the occurrence of alternative stable states in shallow lakes. We hypothesize that bottom-up mechanisms and interactions within the benthic food web are more important in a charophyte-dominated clear-water state, while top-down mechanism and interactions in the planktonic food web prevail at angiosperm dominance. Charophytes, which dominate at lower nutrient concentrations and develop higher densities than most angiosperms, can have a higher influence on sedimentation, resuspension, and water column nutrients. During dominance of dense submerged vegetation like charophytes, zooplankton can be hampered by low food quality and quantity and by high predation pressure from juvenile fish, which in turn are favoured by the high refuge potential of this vegetation. Grazing pressure from zooplankton on phytoplankton can therefore be low in charophytes, but the main feedback in angiosperm-dominated ecosystems. Charophytes offer a higher surface than most angiosperms to periphyton, which favors benthic invertebrates. These support macrophytes by grazing periphyton and constitute a central link in a trophic cascade from fish to periphyton and macrophytes. To test these hypotheses, more experiments and field measurements comparing the effect of charophytes and angiosperms on water clarity are needed.

Historical and Projected Changes in Spawning Phenologies of American Shad and Striped Bass in the Hudson River Estuary	MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES												Predicted increases in temperatures over the next century have raised many concerns about changes in the life history traits and geographical distributions of anadromous fishes. Anadromous fishes are particularly vulnerable to human activities due to the diverse array of habitats needed to complete their life cycle and the proximity of essential habitats to large human population centers. To understand the potential changes in spawning phenology of American Shad Alosa sapidissima and Striped Bass Morone saxatilis in the Hudson River estuary, a model was developed to estimate the onset, cessation, and duration of the spawning season through the 21st century, corresponding to projected water temperatures. Water temperatures for the Hudson River estuary were determined using recent models accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Model results indicate that by the 2090s, the spawning season of both species will initiate, on average, approximately 15 d earlier in the year, with spawning duration reduced by 4 d compared to the average spawning season in the 2010s.

Spawning site fidelity and apparent annual survival of walleye (Sander vitreus) differ between a Lake Huron and Lake Erie tributary	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Fidelity to spawning habitats can maximise reproductive success of fish by synchronising movements to sites of previous recruitment. To determine the role of reproductive fidelity in structuring walleye Sander vitreus populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes, we used acoustic telemetry combined with Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture models to estimate spawning site fidelity and apparent annual survival for the Tittabawassee River in Lake Huron and Maumee River in Lake Erie. Walleye in spawning condition were tagged from the Tittabawassee River in Lake Huron and Maumee River in Lake Erie in 2011-2012. Site fidelity and apparent annual survival were estimated from return of individuals to the stream where tagged. Site fidelity estimates were higher in the Tittabawassee River (95%) than the Maumee River (70%) and were not related to sex or fish length at tagging. Apparent annual survival of walleye tagged in the Tittabawassee did not differ among spawning seasons but was higher for female than male walleye and decreased linearly as fish length increased. Apparent annual survival of walleye tagged in the Maumee River did not differ among spawning seasons but was higher for female walleye than male walleye and increased linearly as fish length increased. Greater fidelity of walleye tagged in the Tittabawassee River than walleye tagged in the Maumee River may be related to the close proximity to the Maumee River of other spawning aggregations and multiple spawning sites in Lake Erie. As spawning site fidelity increases, management actions to conserve population structure require an increasing focus on individual stocks.

Quantifying the exposure levels of CHAB as a potential risk factor for ALS is complicated by human mobility, potential pathways, and data availability. In this work, we develop phycocyanin concentration (i.e., CHAB exposure) maps using satellite remote sensing across northern New England to assess relationships with ALS cases using a spatial epidemiological approach. Strategic semi-analytical regression models integrated Landsat and in situ observations to map phycocyanin concentration (PC) for all lakes greater than 8 ha (n = 4117) across the region. Then, systematic versions of a Bayesian Poisson Log-linear model were fit to assess the mapped PC as a risk factor for ALS while accounting for model uncertainty and modifiable area unit problems. The satellite remote sensing of PC had strong overall ability to map conditions (adj. R2, 0.86; RMSE, 11.92) and spatial variability across the region. PC tended to be positively associated with ALS risk with the level of significance depending on fixed model components. Meta-analysis shows that when average PC exposure is 100 mu g/L, an all model average odds ratio is 1.48, meaning there is about a 48% increase in average ALS risk. This research generated the first regionally comprehensive map of PC for thousands of lakes and integrated robust spatial uncertainty. The outcomes support the hypothesis that cyanotoxins increase the risk of ALS, which helps our understanding of the etiology of ALS.

Climate Change Impact on the Hydrology of Tekeze Basin, Ethiopia: Projection of Rainfall-Runoff for Future Water Resources Planning	WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Climate change impact on Tekeze basin hydrology was studied using bias-corrected ensembles of CORDEX-Africa RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios projections of precipitation and temperature. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) used to simulate streamflow and distribution mapping bias correction improves precipitation and streamflow simulations. Tekeze basin showed an increase in mean temperature up to 1.07 degrees C for RCP4.5 and 2.21 degrees C for RCP8.5 climate scenarios in all time periods. Annual, long rain (Kiremt), and dry (Bega) seasons precipitation also showed an increasing trend up to 48%, whereas short rain (Belg) season showed a decreasing trend up to 52% under both RCP scenarios for all future time periods. For this study, SWAT performs well with values of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-NS) and R-2 greater than 0.7 for simulating streamflow with a reasonable accuracy. Future streamflow in the basin increases and its magnitude varies for each RCP scenarios and projected periods up to 58-66% in dry and 21-55% in rainy seasons. Results from this study indicated that climate changes will affect the basin hydrology and water resources. Due to this future change of streamflow, an input to reservoir operation, climate change scenarios should be incorporated into water resources planning and management of Tekeze basin.

The snow darkening process impacts hydrology by shifting runoff timing and magnitude. Dust on snow deposition has been documented in the Wasatch Mountains, snowmelt from which accounts for up to 80% of surface water supply for Salt Lake City, UT, but the impact on snow melt has not yet been investigated. Here, we present a case study of a dust event observed in the Wasatch (13-14th April, 2017), sampled coincidentally in the air and at the snow surface at an instrumented high elevation site (Atwater Study Plot, Alta, UT). Atmospheric backtrajectory modeling, the results of which were supported by measurements, showed that dust originated predominantly from the west: the Great Salt Lake Desert and the Great Salt Lake (GSL) dry lake bed. The deposited dust mass accounted for similar to 50% of the season total dust loading in snow, and daily mean radiative forcing of 20-50 W M-2 accelerated snow melt by approximately 25%. This has important implications for The Greatest Snow on Earth (R), and snow water resources; the water level of the GSL has been declining, exposing dry lake beds, and there are no legal water rights or protections to maintain lake levels or mitigate dust emission.

Although a sink for N2O through biological fixation has been observed in the Pacific, the regulation of N2O-fixation compared to canonical N-2-fixation is unknown. Here we show that both N2O and N-2 can be fixed by freshwater communities but with distinct seasonalities and temperature dependencies. N2O fixation appears less sensitive to temperature than N-2 fixation, driving a strong sink for N2O in colder months. Moreover, by quantifying both N2O and N-2 fixation we show that, rather than N2O being first reduced to N2 through denitrification, N2O fixation is direct and could explain the widely reported N(2)Osinks in natural waters. Analysis of the nitrogenase (nifH) community suggests that while only a subset is potentially capable of fixing N2O they maintain a strong, freshwater sink for N2O that could be eroded by warming.

Results suggested that the bioavailability and mobility of As in sediments depended on the lake ecological types and seasonal changes. At the algal-type zones and macrophyte-type zones, elevated As concentrations were observed in April and July, while these occurred at the transition areas in July and October. The diffusion flux of soluble As ranged from 0.03 to 3.03 ng/ cm2/d, indicating sediments acted as a source of As. Reductive dissolution of As-bearing iron/manganese-oxides was the key driver of sediment As remobilization. However, labile S(-II) caused by the degradations of algae and macrophytes buffered sediment As release at the algal-type and macrophyte-type zones. Furthermore, the resupply ratio was less than 1 at three ecological lakes, indicating the resupply As capacity of sediment solid phase was partially sustained case. The risk quotient values were higher than 1 at the algal-type zones and transition areas in July, thereby, the adverse effects of As should not be ignored. This suggested that it is urgently need to be specifically monitored and managed for As contamination in sediments across multi-ecological lakes.

While environmental elements like hydrological factors and temperature have a wide impact on vegetation cover changes in lake wetlands, their effects on vegetation cover changes haven't been well separated and evaluated in the context of local temperature change worldwide. Here, we developed a novel indicator (Rtaw) to decouple and evaluate the effects of temperature change and the change of a typical hydrological factor, namely water level, on vegetation cover changes in the Poyang Lake wetland (PLW) from 2003 to 2014. Rtaw compares the vegetation cover changes in the PLW caused by water level fluctuation to those caused by temperature change. The impact of each environmental factor on wetland vegetation changes was measured by the change in area of vegetation-covered PLW (Ap). Our results demonstrate that the PLW experiences the most significant vegetation cover decrease and increase in June and September, respectively. Annual Ap generally increases from 2003 to 2014. The vegetation cover-changed PLW generally extends from the Poyang Lake's center to its coast. Furthermore, while the water level fluctuation-induced vegetation cover variations in the PLW are typically 0.6 times stronger than that caused by temperature change, the latter is 0.17 similar to 2.99 times stronger than the former around every three years and when seasons change. This is caused by the extreme water level, temperature, and their changes with particular values. Meanwhile, the anomalous impact of temperature change occurs in the PLW's vast region. Overall, the applied Rtaw in the PLW revealed the periodic control of temperature change on vegetation cover changes which are widely thought to be dominated by hydrological variations. Therefore, our work could contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the vegetation cover changes in lake wetlands. This also implies that the effects of extreme temperature events on vegetation cover changes in lake wetlands should be paid enough attention.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				APR	2023	148								110041	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110041		FEB 2023											WOS:000998627100001
J	Zhou, X; Rowe, M; Liu, QQ; Xue, PF				Zhou, Xing; Rowe, Mark; Liu, Qianqian; Xue, Pengfei			Comparison of Eulerian and Lagrangian transport models for harmful algal bloom forecasts in Lake Erie	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Lake Erie has experienced a re-emergence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) since the early 2000s, posing significant socioeconomic and ecological consequences that impact drinking water, human health, fish-eries, tourism, and water quality. As predicting CHAB intensity and spatial distribution is critical to Lake Erie ecosystem management, this study focuses on a comprehensive evaluation of Lagrangian and Eulerian transport models for Lake Erie CHAB forecasts, including 1) a Lagrangian particle model (LPM), 2) an Eulerian tracer model (ETM), and 3) a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) that utilizes the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. We evaluated the models' performance against the latest high-resolution satellite product from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor over 24-to 240-h hindcasts for each CHAB occurrence in three consecutive CHAB seasons (2017-2019). We examined the relative contributions of horizontal transport, vertical turbulent mixing, and algal buoyancy on the CHAB inter-and intra-day variability. In the short-term forecast, we emphasize the highly dynamic reaction of currents to weather-scale wind events that are crucial to CHAB transport. While statistical skill assessments show that these three transport models attain comparable levels of hindcast accuracy, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of each model in the context of general bio-physical modeling. In particular, the fact that the ETM and PCPM perform as well as or better than the LPM sets up a promising path to developing more biological realism in future operational forecast models using Eulerian or hybrid approaches.

Simulating the Impact of Global Reservoir Expansion on the Present-Day Climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Reservoir expansion over the last century has largely affected downstream flow characteristics. Yet very little is known about the impacts of reservoir expansion on the climate. Here, we implement reservoir construction in the Community Land Model by enabling dynamical lake area changes, while conserving mass and energy. Transient global lake and reservoir extent are prescribed from the HydroLAKES and Global Reservoir and Dam databases. Land-only simulations covering the 20th century with reservoir expansion enabled, highlight increases in terrestrial water storage and decreases in albedo matching the increase in open water area. The comparison of coupled simulations including and excluding reservoirs shows only limited influence of reservoirs on global temperatures and the surface energy balance, but demonstrates substantial responses locally, in particular where reservoirs make up a large fraction of the grid cell. In those locations, reservoirs dampen the diurnal temperature range by up to -1.5 K (for reservoirs covering >15% of the grid cell), reduce temperature extremes, and moderate the seasonal temperature cycle. This study provides a first step towards a coupled representation of reservoirs in Earth System Models.

Despite functioning as interconnected hydrologic networks, supraglacial lakes and rivers are commonly studied as independent features, resulting in an incomplete understanding of their collective impact on meltwater storage and routing. We use Landsat 8 satellite imagery to assess the seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes and rivers on the southwest GrIS during the 2015 melt season. Remotely sensed meltwater areas and volumes are compared with surface runoff simulations from three climate models (MERRA-2, MAR 3.6 and RACMO 2.3), and with in situ observations of proglacial discharge in the Watson River. We find: (1) at elevations >1600 m, 21% of supraglacial lakes and 28% of supraglacial rivers drain into moulins, signifying the presence of high-elevation surface-to-bed meltwater connections even during a colder-than-average melt season; (2) while supraglacial lakes dominate instantaneous surface meltwater storage, supraglacial rivers dominate total surface meltwater area and discharge; (3) the combined surface area of supraglacial lakes and rivers is strongly correlated with modeled surface runoff; and (4) of the three models examined here, MERRA-2 runoff yields the highest overall correlation with observed proglacial discharge in the Watson River.					; Cooper, Matthew/ADV-3111-2022; Yang, Kang/I-1439-2013; Li, Mengchun/AGW-0259-2022	Cooper, Matthew/0000-0002-0165-209X; Li, Manchun/0009-0009-7357-5642; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				AUG	2021	67	264					592	602	PII S0022143021000101	10.1017/jog.2021.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2021.10													WOS:000670030500002

However, the mechanisms underlying atmospheric water vapour isotopes in the northeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of central Asia remain poorly understood. This study initially investigated water vapour isotopic composition and its controls during the premonsoon and monsoon seasons. Isotopic compositions of water vapour and precipitation exhibited high variability across seasons, with the most negative average delta O-18 values of precipitation and the most positive delta O-18 values of water vapour found during the premonsoon periods. Temperature effect was significant during the premonsoon period but not the monsoon period. Both a higher slope and intercept of the local meteoric water line were found during the monsoon period as compared with in the premonsoon period, suggesting that raindrops have been experienced a greater kinetic fractionation process such as reevaporation below the cloud during the premonsoon periods. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 signatures in atmospheric water vapour tended to be depleted with the occurrence of precipitation events especially during the monsoon period and probably as a result of rainout processes. The monthly average contribution of evaporation from the lake to local precipitation was 35.2%. High d-excess values of water vapour were influenced by the high proportion of local moisture mixing, as indicated by the gradually increasing relative humidity along westerly and Asian monsoon trajectories. The daily observation (observed epsilon) showed deviations from the equilibrium fractionation factors (calculated epsilon), implying that raindrops experienced substantial evaporative enrichment during their descent. The average fraction of raindrops reevaporation was estimated to be 16.4 +/- 12.9%. These findings provide useful insights for understanding the interaction between water vapour and precipitation, moisture sources, and help in reconstructing the paleoclimate in the alpine regions.					; Li, Xiaoyan/K-8544-2012; Zhang, Jianming/AAD-1000-2019	Li, XiaoYan/0000-0002-7454-7821; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV	2019	33	23					2997	3009		10.1002/hyp.13541	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13541		SEP 2019											WOS:000484804800001

In situ methanogenesis linked to algae growth was recently suggested to be the major source of CH4 fluxes from aquatic systems. However, based on our very large data set on CH4 distributions within lakes, we demonstrate here that methane-enriched water from shallow water zones is the most likely source of the basin-wide mean CH4 concentrations in the surface water of lakes. Consistently, the mean surface CH4 concentrations are significantly correlated with the ratio between the surface area of the shallow water zone and the entire lake, f(A,s/t), but not with the total surface area. The categorization of CH4 fluxes according to f(A,s/t) may therefore improve global estimates of CH4 emissions from lakes. Furthermore, CH4 concentrations increase substantially with water temperature, indicating that seasonally resolved data are required to accurately estimate annual CH4 emissions.

Contrasting patterns of genome-level diversity across distinct co-occurring bacterial populations	ISME JOURNAL												To understand the forces driving differentiation and diversification in wild bacterial populations, we must be able to delineate and track ecologically relevant units through space and time. Mapping metagenomic sequences to reference genomes derived from the same environment can reveal genetic heterogeneity within populations, and in some cases, be used to identify boundaries between genetically similar, but ecologically distinct, populations. Here we examine population-level heterogeneity within abundant and ubiquitous freshwater bacterial groups such as the acI Actinobacteria and LD12 Alphaproteobacteria (the freshwater sister clade to the marine SAR11) using 33 single-cell genomes and a 5-year metagenomic time series. The single-cell genomes grouped into 15 monophyletic clusters (termed "tribes") that share at least 97.9% 16S rRNA identity. Distinct populations were identified within most tribes based on the patterns of metagenomic read recruitments to single-cell genomes representing these tribes. Genetically distinct populations within tribes of the acI Actinobacterial lineage living in the same lake had different seasonal abundance patterns, suggesting these populations were also ecologically distinct. In contrast, sympatric LD12 populations were less genetically differentiated. This suggests that within one lake, some freshwater lineages harbor genetically discrete (but still closely related) and ecologically distinct populations, while other lineages are composed of less differentiated populations with overlapping niches. Our results point at an interplay of evolutionary and ecological forces acting on these communities that can be observed in real time.					; Woyke, Tanja/S-7870-2018; Martínez-García, Manuel/AAT-1935-2021; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024; Tringe, Susannah/T-9431-2019; Garcia, Sarahi L./H-4365-2014; Garcia, Sarahi/H-4365-2014; Malmstrom, Rex/K-7339-2012	Stevens, Sarah/0000-0002-7040-548X; Woyke, Tanja/0000-0002-9485-5637; Stepanauskas, Ramunas/0000-0003-4458-3108; Garcia, Sarahi L./0000-0002-8622-0308; Martinez-Garcia, Manuel/0000-0001-5056-1525; Tringe, Susannah/0000-0001-6479-8427; Malmstrom, Rex/0000-0002-4758-7369													1751-7362	1751-7370				MAR	2018	12	3					742	755		10.1038/s41396-017-0001-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-017-0001-0								29222442					WOS:000427226100010

For the evaluation of the risk due to heavy metals, the current study assessed spatial and temporal variation of acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), simultaneously extracted metal (SEM), and total metal concentration as toxicity indicator of aquatic sediments in Vembanad Lake System (VLS), India. Surface sediment samples collected from 12 locations from the northern portion of VLS for 4 years during different seasons. The results suggest, in post-monsoon season, 91% of the sampling locations possessed high bioavailability of metals and results in toxicity to aquatic biota. The average seasonal distribution of SEM during the period of observations was in the order post-monsoon > pre-monsoon > monsoon (1.76 +/- 2.00 > 1.35 +/- 0.60 > 0.80 +/- 0.54 mu mol/g). The concentration of individual metals on Sigma SEM are in the order SEM Zn > SEM Cu> SEM Cd approximate to SEM Pb > SEM Hg. Considering annual SSEM/AVS ratio, 83% of the sites cross the critical value of 'One,' reveals that active sulfide phase of the sediment for fixing the metals is saturated. The molar ratio (differences between SEM and AVS) and its normalized organic carbon ratio reveals that in the post-monsoon season, about 42% of the sites are in the category of adverse effects are possible. The study suggests the toxicity and mobility of the metals largely depend on the available AVS, and the current situation may pose harm to benthic organisms.					; Mohan, Mahesh/C-3076-2011	Mohan, Mahesh/0000-0003-1003-5357; M S, SHYLESH CHANDRAN/0000-0002-0273-5903; Ramasamy, E.V./0000-0002-6421-8530; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2018	25	8			SI		7333	7345		10.1007/s11356-017-0997-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0997-8								29275481					WOS:000427398200024

Internal waves, an under-explored source of turbulence events in the sedimentary record	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Internal waves occur nearly ubiquitously in lakes and oceans yet their sedimentary records remain largely unrecognized. Waves propagate at the interface between fluids of different densities. Surface waves propagate at the interface between air and water, which is a strong density gradient. Internal waves propagate along weaker gradients (pycnoclines) within density-stratified fluids, behaving similarly to surface waves but typically at lower frequencies and larger amplitudes. Internal waves that occur at tidal frequencies are called internal tides; they are very common on the outer continental shelf and slope, and are generated as the surface tides move stratified water up and down a sloping surface. Large internal solitary waves known as solitons are ubiquitous wherever strong currents and stratification occur in the vicinity of irregular topography. These waves can force short-period, strong bottom-current pulses and may trigger upslope-surging vortex cores of dense fluid (boluses) that can induce mobilization of bottom sediments. Internal-wave deposits (internalites) are highly variable and definitive criteria for recognition are still to be developed. In terrigenous-dastic systems and shallow-water settings, internalites can be seen as "out-of-context" tempestites, detached from shore-related deposits and lacking thickening/coarsening upward sequences. In contrast to surface storm waves, the impact of internal waves is usually strongest in mid-outer-shelf regions and weaker in shallow water. Internal waves also provide a plausible mechanism to explain the origin of hummocky cross-stratification, especially their occurrence in different depositional environments. In deeper settings (continental slopes and canyons), internalites may have sedimentary structures indicating tidal currents and may coexist with turbidites. In carbonate systems, internal waves influence both sediment remobilization and the carbonate-producing biota. Differentiation between internal waves and surface storm waves is more reliable because many skeletal constituents have specific bathymetric distributions. Moreover, internal waves influence nutrient plankton and larval distributions while inducing thermal variations by vertical displacements of the thermocline. The sharp gradient in nutrients and the chlorophyll-maximum zone typically correspond with the base of the seasonal pycnocline, which is commonly in the lower part of the photic zone. Suspension-feeding metazoans can thrive near the pycnocline, which explains the common occurrence of Phanerozoic metazoan buildups at mid- and outer ramp settings. During paleoceanographic changes that have influenced ocean stratification, internal waves may also have been a mechanism influencing diversification and extinction of these mid- and outer-ramp benthic communities.

Downstream Nutrient Concentrations Depend on Watershed Inputs More Than Reservoir Releases in a Highly Engineered Watershed	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In this study, we characterized the impact of regulatory water releases relative to watershed inputs on the quality of receiving waters to identify if and how managed releases could be scheduled to mitigate nutrient export and downstream water quality impairment. We specifically investigated freshwater flow partitioning to the Caloosahatchee River and Estuary (CRE) from a large managed lake, Lake Okeechobee, and the CRE's upstream watershed, the C-43 basin, in southwest Florida (USA). A water balance was developed to identify dominant freshwater inflow sources (i.e., Lake Okeechobee vs. watershed inputs) over time. From the water balance, analyses of historical trends were performed to detect changes in freshwater inflow contributions to the CRE. Further, seasonal and annual concentration variations and long-term concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships were analyzed to better understand biogeochemical and hydrological processes in the system in relation to freshwater source. Since 1966, we found the duration and magnitude of flows from the C-43 basin were higher than those from Lake Okeechobee releases. However, recent increases in the annual water volume and proportion of inflow coming from Lake Okeechobee to the CRE were observed. The C-Q analysis revealed that nitrate and ammonium concentrations in the CRE were responsive to changes in discharge, while total phosphorus and orthophosphate concentrations were chemostatic. While modifications to the Lake Okeechobee operation schedule could potentially mitigate downstream inorganic nitrogen loading, this potential is limited by complex, seasonal C-Q relationships and confounding effects from surrounding watersheds. Water levels in large lakes at risk of flooding into surrounding areas are controlled using engineered structures like dams. To ensure water levels do not overtop a lake's banks, water is released from control structures and then flows into downstream waterways like rivers and estuaries. When a managed lake has water quality challenges, such as excess nutrient concentrations or harmful algal blooms, water releases may affect the quality of downstream waters, but determining the role of released waters on downstream water quality is challenging. In this study, we analyzed nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the Caloosahatchee River and Estuary (CRE), a waterway that receives released water from Lake Okeechobee, a large managed lake, to understand whether there were relationships between Lake Okeechobee water releases and nutrient concentrations in the CRE. We found that released water had an impact on downstream water quality, but that water runoff from the surrounding land area had a greater effect. Nitrogen concentrations varied based on the time of year and amount of flowing water, while phosphorus concentrations did not. Therefore, changes to the timing and volume of water releases may not affect downstream phosphorus concentrations, but could potentially improve downstream nitrogen concentrations. Downstream nitrate & ammonium concentrations were seasonally responsive to flow, while total phosphorus & orthophosphate were chemostatic Nutrient concentrations were strongly related to watershed inputs, and less consistently to regulatory releases Restoring downstream water quality will require reservoir and watershed management, and actions that go beyond modified release scheduling					Milbrandt, Eric/AAH-4690-2019; Morrison, Elise/AAJ-2780-2021; Nelson, Natalie/M-1768-2019; Kaplan, David/G-5951-2010; Arias, Mauricio/H-5667-2013	Montefiore, Lise/0000-0002-9666-7576; Kaplan, David/0000-0002-0103-0928; Milbrandt, Eric/0000-0003-1998-7055; Nelson, Natalie/0000-0002-3258-7622; Morrison, Elise/0000-0003-2569-4259													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAR	2024	60	3							e2023WR035590	10.1029/2023WR035590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR035590													WOS:001186338300001

Recent efforts have led to the development of long-term model projections of climate change effects on lake thermal regimes and oxygen solubility. However, such projections are hardly ever confronted with observations extending over multiple decades. Furthermore, global-scale forcing parameters in lake models present several limitations, such as the need of significant downscaling. In this study, the effects of climate change on thermal regime and oxygen solubility were analyzed in the four largest French peri-alpine lakes over 1850-2100. We tested several one-dimensional (1D) lake models' robustness for long-term variations based on up to 63 years of limnological data collected by the French Observatory of LAkes (OLA). Here, we evaluate the possibility of forcing mechanistic models by following the long-term evolution of shortwave radiation and air temperature while providing realistic seasonal trends for the other variables for which local-scale downscaling often lacks accuracy. Based on this approach, MyLake, forced by air temperatures and shortwave radiations, predicted accurately the variations in the lake thermal regime over the last 4 to 6 decades, with RMSE < 1.95 degrees C. Over the previous 3 decades, water temperatures have increased by 0.46 degrees C per decade (+/- 0.02 degrees C) in the epilimnion and 0.33 degrees C per decade (+/- 0.06 degrees C) in the hypolimnion. Concomitantly and due to thermal change, O2 solubility has decreased by -0.104 mg L-1 per decade (+/- 0.005 mg L-1) and -0.096 mg L-1 per decade (+/- 0.011 mg L-1) in the epilimnion and hypolimnion, respectively. Based on the shared socio-economic pathway SSP370 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), peri-alpine lakes could face an increase of 3.80 degrees C (+/- 0.20 degrees C) in the next 70 years, accompanied by a decline of 1.0 mg L-1 (+/- 0.1 mg L-1) of O-2 solubility. Together, these results highlight a critical alteration in lake thermal and oxygen conditions in the coming decades, and a need for a better integration of long-term lake observatories data and lake models to anticipate climate effects on lake thermal regimes and habitats.

Pinpointing areas of increased soil erosion risk following land cover change in the Lake Manyara catchment, Tanzania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Lack of long-term scientific land cover and erosional data impedes the development of sustainable land management plans to tackle land degradation and soil erosion problems in Tanzania. Using Landsat imagery, almost three decades of land cover change in the Lake Manyara catchment (1988-2016) was reconstructed. Data highlight that the major land cover types are highly dynamic and that there is a net conversion of natural or semi-natural land cover towards agricultural uses. Specifically, the biggest net declining cover types were found to be 'bushland', 'seasonal grassland' and 'permanent savanna', which have reduced by 8.7, 6.1 and 3.5% respectively. In this context an erosion risk model, based on the 'Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation', was applied to evaluate how changing land cover has affected risk of surface soil erosion by water. Model outputs indicate that a lot of land conversion has occurred in areas that are naturally vulnerable due to topography, soil type and rainfall patterns, seriously increasing the soil erosion risk. The resulting output maps can be particularly useful in pinpointing potential areas of increased erosion risk underpinning targeted investigation and management action to support soil conservation for improved food and water security.					; Wynants, Maarten/AAX-9992-2020; Solomon, Henok/AAF-3402-2020	Blake, William/0000-0001-9447-1361; Solomon, Henok/0000-0002-7236-5725; Wynants, Maarten/0000-0002-5367-7619													0303-2434					SEP	2018	71						1	8		10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.008													WOS:000441116900001

The spatial-temporal distributions and the SPM-water partition of PAHs and their influencing factors were investigated. The potential sources and contributions of PAHs in the sediment were estimated by positive matrix factorization (PMF) and probabilistic stable isotopic analysis (PSIA). The results showed that the average residual levels of total PAHs (PAH16) in the water, SPM and sediment were 170.7 +/- 70.8 ng/L, 210.7 +/- 160.7 ng/L and 908.5 +/- 1878.1 ng/g dry weight, respectively. The same spatial distribution trend of PAH16 in the water, SPM and sediment was found from high to low: river inflows > western lake > eastern lake > water source area. There was an obvious seasonal trend of PAH16 in the water, while no obvious seasonal trend was found in the SPM. The residues and distributions of PAHs in the water, SPM and sediment relied heavily on carbon content. Significant Pearson correlations were found between LogK(oc) and LogK(ow) as well as some hydro-meteorological factors. Three major sources of PAHs including coal and biomass combustions, and vehicle emissions were identified.

J	Yang, CH; Yang, P; Yin, HB				Yang, Chunhui; Yang, Pan; Yin, Hongbin			In situ control of internal nutrient loading and fluxes in the confluence area of an eutrophic lake with combined P inactivation agents and modified zeolite	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, a field in situ inactivation experiment was carried out to control the confluence area sediment nu-trient loading and fluxes using modified zeolite (MZ) in combination with poly aluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB). The results indicated that PAC + MZ and LMB + MZ can reduce 76% and 75% of the P flux and 20% and 27% of the N flux, respectively. These results are based on a comparison with a control treatment over four months under the influence of external loading. However, their control effi-ciency on sediment nutrient fluxes decreased largely during the summertime algal blooming season. Both of the treatments lost their N control efficiency at this time. In contrast, LMB + MZ can still reduce 27% of the P flux compared to the control treatment. Surface sediment extractable ammonium increased substantially from the PAC + MZ and LMB + MZ treatments, which is 1.8 and 2.2 times more than the extractable ammonium in the control sediment after 210 days of remediation. The P fractionation analysis indicated that, in the PAC + MZ and LMB + MZ, both NaOH-rP and HCl-P increased greatly at a rate of 1.5 and 3.9 times, respectively, compared to the control sediment. PAC + MZ and LMB + MZ reduced the mobile P by 21% and 43%, respectively compared with the control sediment after 210 days of remediation. Bacteria richness and diversity in the PAC + MZ and LMB + MZ treatments had no obvious distinction when compared with the control treatment after 210 days of remediation but had a transient decrease in the LMB + MZ and recovered as it returned back to the same level found in control after 60 days. The results indicated that the control efficiency of nutrient fluxes in sediment might vary with types of inactivation agents and dosing methods and can be largely reduced under the influence of external loading and algal blooms.

Harmful Algal Blooms Threaten the Health of Peri-Urban Fisher Communities: A Case Study in Kisumu Bay, Lake Victoria, Kenya	EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Available guidance to mitigate health risks from exposure to freshwater harmful algal blooms (HABs) is largely derived from temperate ecosystems. Yet in tropical ecosystems, HABs can occur year-round, and resource-dependent populations face multiple routes of exposure to toxic components. Along Winam Gulf, Lake Victoria, Kenya, fisher communities rely on lake water contaminated with microcystins (MCs) from HABs. In these peri-urban communities near Kisumu, we tested hypotheses that MCs exceed exposure guidelines across seasons, and persistent HABs present a chronic risk to fisher communities through ingestion with minimal water treatment and frequent, direct contact. We tested source waters at eleven communities across dry and rainy seasons from September 2015 through May 2016. We measured MCs, other metabolites, physicochemical parameters, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton abundance and diversity, and fecal indicators. We then selected four communities for interviews about water sources, usage, and treatment. Greater than 30% of source water samples exceeded WHO drinking water guidelines for MCs (1 mu g/L), and over 60% of source water samples exceeded USEPA guidelines for children and immunocompromised individuals. 50% of households reported a sole source of raw lake water for drinking and household use, with alternate sources including rain and boreholes. Household chlorination was the most widespread treatment utilized. At this tropical, eutrophic lake, HABs pose a year-round health risk for fisher communities in resource -limited settings. Community-based solutions and site-specific guidance for Kisumu Bay and similarly impacted regions is needed to address a chronic health exposure likely to increase in severity and duration with global climate change.

The proposed methodology features a combination of a semi-analytical poroelastic model with an earthquake nucleation approach based on rate-and-state frictional law. The combined approach was applied to the case of the Pertusillo Lake, located in the Val d'Agri area (Italy), whose large seasonal water level changes are believed to induce protracted micro-seismicity (local magnitude M-L < 3). Results show that the lake impoundment in 1962 could have produced up to 0.5 bar (1 bar = 100 kPa) changes in Coulomb failure stress (Delta CFS), while the seasonal water level variation is responsible for variation up to 0.05 bar. Modeling results of the seismicity rates in 2001-2014 show that the observed earthquakes are well correlated with the modeled Delta CFS. Finally, the reason that the seismicity is only observed at southwest of the Pertusillo Lake is provided, which is likely attributed to different rock lithologies and depletion caused by significant hydrocarbon exploitation in the northeastern sector of the lake.

However, some basic questions remain unclear to date, such as: (i) spatial and temporal variations of phytoplankton, (ii) the impact of upstream lakes on downstream community, (iii) themain drivers for species composition or (iv) the regional biodiversity along a lentic-lotic continuum. To answer these questions, we collected and analyzed the fluvial phytoplankton communities along a lentic-lotic continuum from a German lowland catchment, where a well-established ecohydrological modeling predicted long-term discharges at each sampling site. Our results revealed very high spatial and temporal variations of phytoplankton community. The changes of a lake on downstream phytoplankton assemblages were significant, especially the nearest reach after the lake. However, these influences varied along with seasons and limited in a relatively short distance to the lake. Redundancy analysis and Mantel tests showed that phytoplankton composition and dissimilarities along the lentic-lotic continuum attributed more to local hydrological and physicochemical variables than species dispersal, which confirmed the suitability of lowland phytoplankton-based bioassessment. In addition, our findings highlighted the importance of flow regime in shaping phytoplankton community composition and regional beta diversities. This study emphasized the necessity to include the hydrological variables and their relationship with phytoplankton community in future bio-monitoring investigations. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Diniz, LP; Petsch, DK; Bonecker, CC				Diniz, Leidiane Pereira; Petsch, Danielle Katharine; Bonecker, Claudia Costa			Zooplankton β diversity dynamics and metacommunity structure depend on spatial and temporal scales in a Neotropical floodplain	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Both beta diversity and metacommunity structure vary in time and space. It is necessary to examine different scales, especially in the face of extreme hydrological conditions. We investigated seasonal variation in beta diversity and Elements of Metacommunity Structure [EMS] of zooplankton during four years (two years of prolonged drought and two years with extreme flood events) and at two spatial scales (sub-basins and floodplain; smaller and larger spatial scale, respectively). We sampled 29 lakes quarterly during four years in the Upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil. We estimated the replacement component of beta diversity using the Jaccard dissimilarity index. We also used EMS to determine the metacommunity pattern of zooplankton distribution in each period and spatial scale. The flood peak observed in the snapshot sampling drove the homogenization of zooplanktonic assemblages. However, beta diversity was not reduced in the two years with extreme flood events compared to the period of prolonged drought at either of the spatial scales (floodplain and sub-basins), except for a single sub-basin. This finding shows the importance of longer-term ecological studies to better capture the dynamics of the zooplanktonic metacommunity. Regardless of the hydrological period and spatial scale zooplanktonic metacommunity structure remained practically constant throughout the four years, with a predominance of species range turnover (Clementsian). At the smallest spatial scale (sub-basins), we found quasi-structural patterns (quasi-Clementsian and quasi-Gleasonian). The predominance of the Clementsian pattern suggests that the associations of zooplankton species in the floodplain responded similarly to the environmental gradient and that the responses differed among species groups. Over time, the smaller spatial scale (sub-basin) better represents the dynamics of beta diversity than the larger spatial scale (floodplain), and better represents the structure of the zooplankton metacommunity. However, we emphasize the need for further studies to consider different biological groups and larger spatial scale over time to maximize the understanding of aquatic metacommunities dynamics.

J	Gibson, ESL				Gibson, Erin S. L.			Remembering Tomorrow: Wagon Roads, Identity and the Decolonization of a First Nations Landscape	PUBLIC HISTORY REVIEW												Roads embody the experiences of those who construct, use and maintain them through time. This paper explores the social life of a wagon road located in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Situated between Port Douglas to the south and the Lillooet Lake in the north (Figure 1), this road is best known for its role as a route to the Fraser River Gold Rush in the mid-nineteenth century. I illustrate here that its significance transcends this colonial past. This article explores the roads entanglement in the lives of two contemporary groups: the indigenous Stl'atl'imx (pronounced Stat-lee-um) of the lower Lillooet River Valley whose traditional territories are bisected by the road; and a group of non-First Nations (indigenous) Grade 10 high school students from the Langley School District who hike the road as part of their history and geography curriculum. While these two groups differ in their relationship with the road both find meanings through their entanglement with it. My approach to this wagon road is based on my understanding that roads are material culture or 'things' that both produce, and are products of, complex relationships with the human, non-human and natural world. While roads are shaped through human intentions that inscribe meaning into their design, these same roads influence how humans engage with them - they may cause one to slip, change route or rebuild their surface. 1 In applying a symmetrical approach to the wagon road I highlight its agency and ability to become enmeshed in social relationships in complex ways. 2 Before delving into the theoretical foundations for this article it is important to provide some cultural background to the Stl'atl'imx of the lower Lillooet River Valley. The Stl'atl'imx are an Interior Salish people who divide themselves into those of the 'upper territory' - including the areas around Lillooet -and the 'lower territory' or the lower Lillooet River Valley, the people whose territory ranges from the Harrison Lake in the south to Lillooet Lake in the north. This article focuses on the Stl'atl'imx of the lower Lillooet River Valley who speak the Ucwalmicwts ('oo-Kwale-MEWK) language. They are organised into the Xa'xtsa (pronounced HAHK-cha), Skatin and the Samahquam Nations. In 1993 the political entity of In-SHUCK-ch Nation was created to represent the Stl'atl'imx of the lower Lillooet River Valley in the land claims process with the Government of Canada and province of British Columbia. Through engaging with the road -building, using and maintaining it -the students and Stl'atl'imx initiated a dialogue among human, nonhuman and the natural world. 3 It is through this dialogue that the wagon road and those who engaged with it were co-created: they are interdependent and entangled. As Latour states, 'things do not exist without being full of people'. 4 In many ways, then, this article is an exploration of heritage -how it is created and embedded through human interaction with the material, non-human and natural world and how it changes through time. While not framed as a discussion of heritage, this article lays the foundations for understanding heritage as both experience and process. 5 The Harrison-Lillooet wagon road was built by the Royal Engineers in 1859 to provide miners and merchants with a less dangerous route to travel to the Fraser Canyon, the location of the Fraser River Gold Rush. 6 It replaced a pack trail built in 1858 that is believed to have followed the route of a pre-existing First Nations (indigenous) trail. Mile zero of the Harrison-Lillooet route was Port Douglas, named for the Governor of the Crown Colony of Vancouver Island, James Douglas, located on the northern end of Harrison Lake. While the Harrison-Lillooet road fell out of use for transporting supplies to the goldfields in 1865 after a new Fraser Canyon route was opened, the Stl'at'limx of the lower Lillooet River Valley continued to travel and maintain this road. In the early 1900s barges regularly transported equipment, groceries and mail to Port Douglas to supply the growing number of logging camps in the area. 7 Many of the Stl'atl'imx living along the Lillooet River travelled the wagon road -once every two weeks -to Port Douglas from their reserves to the north to obtain their groceries, mail and visit relatives living in the town. The wagon road was replaced as a communication route in 1953 when a new Forestry Service Road was opened.																			1037-9851	1833-4989					2016	23						25	42		10.5130/phrj.v23i0.5326	http://dx.doi.org/10.5130/phrj.v23i0.5326													WOS:000393475600003

In this study, samples of sediments and potential sources including farmland, forest, aquaculture, industrial and rural area were collected. Carbon stable isotope (combing delta C-13(DOM) and C/N ratios) and fluorescence spectroscopy were applied to calculate the relative contribution of each DOM source in Dagu estuary. Furthermore, their capabilities for the source apportionment were compared. Results suggested that the input sources of DOM obtained with isotope ratios contained most of the land uses in Dagu estuary. And farmland, aquaculture and industry were the dominant sources. By contrast, the source obtained with fluorescence spectroscopy was mainly aquaculture. Furthermore, we discussed the spatial variability of source contributions in different locations along the river (from internal to seaward areas) based on isotope ratio analysis. These results indicated that: (1) In general, the allochthonous input of DOM derived from multiple sources. In different sediment sites, the contributions of land use were different. (2) Among the potential sources, aquaculture and industrial areas were the dominated sources.

Is this vegetation a remnant of a once continuous temperate forest extensively cleared by humans, or has the area, since the last glacial, always been a forest steppe? Understanding the processes that drive temperate grassland formation is important because effective management of this biome is critical to the conservation of the European cultural landscape. Location Lake Stiucii, north-western Romania, central-eastern Europe. Methods We analysed multi-proxy variables (pollen, coprophilous fungi, plant macroremains, macrocharcoal) from a 55,000year discontinuous sequence (c. 55,000-35,000; 13,000-0cal. yr bp), integrating models of pollen-based vegetation cover, biome reconstruction, global atmospheric simulations and archaeological records. Results Needleleaf woodland occurred during glacial Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, but contracted at the end of this period. Forest coverage of c. 55% (early Holocene) and 65% (mid-Holocene) prevailed through the Holocene, but Bronze Age humans extensively cleared forests after 3700cal. yr bp. Forest coverage was most widespread between 8600 and 3700cal. yr bp, whereas grasses, steppe and xerothermic forbs were most extensive between 11,700 and 8600cal. yr bp and during the last 3700cal. yr bp. Cerealia pollen indicate the presence of arable agriculture by c. 7000cal. yr bp. Main conclusions We have provided the first unequivocal evidence for needleleaf woodland during glacial MIS 3 in this region. Extensive forests prevailed prior to 3700cal. yr bp, challenging the hypothesis that the Transylvanian lowlands were never wooded following the last glaciation. However, these forests were never fully closed either, reflecting dry growing season conditions, recurrent fires and anthropogenic impacts, which have favoured grassland persistence throughout the Holocene. The longevity of natural and semi-natural grasslands in the region may explain their current exceptional biodiversity. This longer-term perspective implies that future climatic warming and associated fire will maintain these grasslands.					; Veres, Daniel/AAX-3319-2020; Nielsen, Anne/H-3996-2011; Hutchinson, Simon/D-2766-2015; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Marinova, Elena/E-9935-2010; Timar-Gabor, Alida/AAD-2943-2020	Timar-Gabor, Alida/0000-0003-4799-3866; Feurdean, Angelica/0000-0002-2497-3005; Hutchinson, Simon/0000-0003-0072-1062; Veres, Daniel/0000-0003-3932-577X; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Marinova, Elena/0000-0003-3793-3317; Nielsen, Anne Birgitte/0000-0001-7854-353X													0305-0270	1365-2699				MAY	2015	42	5					951	963		10.1111/jbi.12468	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12468													WOS:000352793700013

Food and Feeding Biology of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in Lake Langeno, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABILITY												This study aimed to investigate the natural feeding behavior of Nile tilapia in Lake Langeno, Ethiopia, with emphasis on potential spatial, size and seasonal effects on ingested food items. This study of the food and feeding biology of O. niloticus in Lake Langeno, Ethiopia, was conducted from March 2016to February 2017. Fish samples were collected monthly from six different sampling sites using different mesh sizes of gillnets. A total of 610 fish specimens with full stomachs were considered for the assessment of feeding biology. In total, seven food items, namely phytoplankton, zooplankton, insects, detritus, macrophytes, fish parts and nematodes, were identified from the fish stomach contents. Phytoplankton was the most commonly consumed food prey, followed by detritus, zooplankton and macrophytes. The other food items were occasionally and randomly consumed. Phytoplankton and detritus were the dominant food prey in the dry season, with zooplankton and macrophytes the main prey during the wet months. The contribution of phytoplankton, zooplankton and insects were slightly highest in small-sized groups (<10 cm), whereas detritus, macrophytes and fish parts were highest in larger-size groups (>20 cm) (p < 0.05). The present results point to a concurrence of the relative importance of dietary items at the individual level, species level and among the study sites. Phytoplankton was the primary consumed food item, which indicates the specialist feeding strategy of Nile tilapia in the lake. Generally, food items of plant origin, typically associated with less protein content than animal origin food items, dominated the stomach contents of Nile tilapia. The dietary pattern of Nile tilapia in Lake Langeno shifts with size and season, aspects that might warrant further study in view of aquaculture applications as well as climate change.

Physical drivers facilitating a toxigenic cyanobacterial bloom in a major Great Lakes tributary	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Maumee River is the primary source for nutrients fueling seasonalMicrocystis-dominated blooms in western Lake Erie's open waters though such blooms in the river are infrequent. The river also serves as source water for multiple public water systems and a large food services facility in northwest Ohio. On 20 September 2017, an unprecedented bloom was reported in the Maumee River estuary within the Toledo metropolitan area, which triggered a recreational water advisory. Here we (1) explore physical drivers likely contributing to the bloom's occurrence, and (2) describe the toxin concentration and bacterioplankton taxonomic composition. A historical analysis using 10-years of seasonal river discharge, water level, and local wind data identified two instances when high-retention conditions occurred over >= 10 d in the Maumee River estuary: in 2016 and during the 2017 bloom. Observation by remote sensing imagery supported the advection of cyanobacterial cells into the estuary from the lake during 2017 and the lack of an estuary bloom in 2016 due to a weak cyanobacterial bloom in the lake. A rapid-response survey during the 2017 bloom determined levels of the cyanotoxins, specifically microcystins, in excess of recreational contact limits at sites within the lower 20 km of the river while amplicon sequencing found these sites were dominated byMicrocystis. These results highlight the need to broaden our understanding of physical drivers of cyanobacterial blooms within the interface between riverine and lacustrine systems, particularly as such blooms are expected to become more prominent in response to a changing climate.

K.; Zolitschka, Bernd			Varves in marine sediments: A review	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The global compilation of reported marine varved sedimentary records throughout the Quaternary contains 52 sites. Marine varve deposition and preservation typically depend on environmental and sedimentological conditions, such as a sufficiently high sedimentation rate, severe depletion of dissolved oxygen in bottom water to exclude bioturbation by macrobenthos, and a seasonally varying sedimentary input to yield a recognizable rhythmic varve pattern. Additional oceanographic factors include the strength and depth range of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) and regional anthropogenic eutrophication from point sources such as large polluted rivers. Quaternary marine varves are not only found in those parts of the open ocean that comply with these conditions, but also in fjords, embayments and estuaries with thermohaline density stratification, and nearshore 'marine lakes' with strong hydrologic connections to ocean water. This review critically describes settings and sedimentological characteristics of marine sites where varves have been reported. Broader applications of marine varve records are discussed, for example in terms of radiocarbon calibration on high-resolution time scales, constraining paleoceanographic variability and global change teleconnections, diagnosing factors affecting modern fish population dynamics based on past performance, detailing biogeochemical cycles, and deciphering complex factors influencing marine productivity. Varves in saline water bodies without hydrologic connection to the global ocean are not included in this review and instead pertain to the companion review on lacustrine varves where also general and fundamental principles of varve deposition, classification, and dating are covered (Zolitschka et al., 2015). The postulated occurrence of varves in pre-Quaternary rocks is critically discussed in this review with representative examples. In the case of non-evaporitic laminations in fine-grained.ancient marine rocks, such as banded iron formations and black shales, laminations may not be varves but instead may have multiple alternative origins such as event beds or formation via bottom currents that transport and sort silt-sized particles, clay floccules, and organic-mineral aggregates in the form of migrating bedload ripples.

Invasive Macrophytes Control the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen in a Shallow Lake: A Proposed Feedback Mechanism of Macrophyte Loss	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Submerged macrophytes can have a profound effect on shallow lake ecosystems through their ability to modify the thermal structure and dissolved oxygen levels within the lake. Invasive macrophytes, in particular, can grow rapidly and induce thermal gradients in lakes that may substantially change the ecosystem structure and challenge the survival of aquatic organisms. We performed fine-scale measurements and 3D numerical modeling at high spatiotemporal resolution to assess the effect of the seasonal growth of Potamogeton crispus L. on the spatial and temporal dynamics of temperature and dissolved oxygen in a shallow urban lake (Lake Monger, Perth, WA, Australia). Daytime stratification developed during the growing season and was clearly observed throughout the macrophyte bed. At all times measured, stratification was stronger at the center of the macrophyte bed compared to the bed edges. By fitting a logistic growth curve to changes in plant height over time (r(2) D 0.98), and comparing this curve to temperature data at the center of the macrophyte bed, we found that stratification began once the macrophytes occupied at least 50% of the water depth. This conclusion was strongly supported by a 3D hydrodynamic model fitted to weekly temperature profiles measured at four time periods throughout the growing season (r(2) > 0.78 at all times). As the macrophyte height increased and stratification developed, dissolved oxygen concentration profiles changed from vertically homogeneous oxic conditions during both the day and night to expression of night-time anoxic conditions close to the sediments. Spatially interpolated maps of dissolved oxygen and 3D numerical modeling results indicated that the plants also reduced horizontal exchange with surrounding unvegetated areas, preventing flushing of low dissolved oxygen water out of the center of the bed. Simultaneously, aerial imagery showed central dieback occurring toward the end of the growing season. Thus, we hypothesized that stratification-induced anoxia can lead to accelerated P. crispus dieback in this region, causing formation of a ring-shaped pattern in spatial macrophyte distribution. Overall, our study demonstrates that submerged macrophytes can alter the thermal characteristics and oxygen levels within shallow lakes and thus create challenging conditions for maximizing their spatial coverage.

Analysis of hydrometeorological variables over the transboundary Komadugu-Yobe basin, West Africa	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Spatiotemporal trends in daily observed precipitation, river discharge, maximum and minimum temperature data were investigated between 1971 and 2013 in the Komadugu-Yobe basin. Significant change points in time series are corrected using Adapted Caussinus-Mestre Algorithm for homogenizing Networks of Temperature series algorithm. Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope are used to estimate the trend and its magnitude at dry, wet and annual season time scales, respectively. Preliminary results show an increasing trend of the observed variables. There is a latitudinal increase (decrease) in the basin temperature (precipitation) from lower to higher latitudes. The minimum temperature (0.05 degrees C/year) increases faster than the maximum temperature (0.03 degrees C/year). Overall, the percentage changes in minimum temperature range between 3 and 10% while that of maximum temperature ranges between 1 and 3%. Due to precipitation dependence on regional characteristics, the highest percentage change was recorded in precipitation with values between -5 and 97%. In all time scales, river discharge and precipitation have strong positive correlations while the correlation between river discharge and temperature is negative. It is imperative to advocate and support positive developmental practices as well as establishing necessary mitigation measures to cope with the effects of climate in the basin.

J	Martinez-Feria, R; Basso, B				Martinez-Feria, Rafael; Basso, Bruno			Predicting soil carbon changes in switchgrass grown on marginal lands under climate change and adaptation strategies	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY												The United States Great Lakes Region (USGLR) is a critical geographic area for future bioenergy production. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is widely considered a carbon (C)-neutral or C-negative bioenergy production system, but projected increases in air temperature and precipitation due to climate change might substantially alter soil organic C (SOC) dynamics and storage in soils. This study examined long-term SOC changes in switchgrass grown on marginal land in the USGLR under current and projected climate, predicted using a process-based model (Systems Approach to Land-Use Sustainability) extensively calibrated with a wealth of plant and soil measurements at nine experimental sites. Simulations indicate that these soils are likely a net C sink under switchgrass (average gain 0.87 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)), although substantial variation in the rate of SOC accumulation was predicted (range: 0.2-1.3 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Principal component analysis revealed that the predicted intersite variability in SOC sequestration was related in part to differences in climatic characteristics, and to a lesser extent, to heterogeneous soils. Although climate change impacts on switchgrass plant growth were predicted to be small (4%-6% decrease on average), the increased soil respiration was predicted to partially negate SOC accumulations down to 70% below historical rates in the most extreme scenarios. Increasing N fertilizer rate and decreasing harvest intensity both had modest SOC sequestration benefits under projected climate, whereas introducing genotypes better adapted to the longer growing seasons was a much more effective strategy. Best-performing adaptation scenarios were able to offset >60% of the climate change impacts, leading to SOC sequestration 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)under projected climate. On average, this was 0.3 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)more C sequestered than the no adaptation baseline. These findings provide crucial knowledge needed to guide policy and operational management for maximizing SOC sequestration of future bioenergy production on marginal lands in the USGLR.					; Basso, Bruno/A-3128-2012; Basso, Bruno/AAF-1271-2019	Martinez-Feria, Rafael/0000-0002-4230-5684; Basso, Bruno/0000-0003-2090-4616; 													1757-1693	1757-1707				SEP	2020	12	9					742	755		10.1111/gcbb.12726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12726		JUL 2020											WOS:000550502500001
J	Hu, X; Lu, Z; Wang, T				Hu, Xie; Lu, Zhong; Wang, Teng			Characterization of Hydrogeological Properties in Salt Lake Valley, Utah, using InSAR	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Charactering subsurface aquifer systems is important not only to managing their long-term viability as a stable water source but also to protecting the residences and infrastructures. In particular, understanding how aquifer skeletons deform in response to hydraulic head changes requires hydrogeological parameters such as decay coefficient, storage coefficient, and bulk compressibility. Quantifying these key aquifer properties often requires the analysis of limited water gauge and drilling data. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal correlation between the vertical ground deformation derived by ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and Sentinel-1A data sets and available hydrological records in order to improve the aquifer characterization under Salt Lake Valley, Utah. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar results show a clear long-term and seasonal correlation between surface uplift/subsidence and groundwater recharge/discharge, with evidence for the net uplift of 15mm/year of an area southwest of Salt Lake City for six years. The long-term uplift, bounded by faults and contained within the water discharge area, reflects a net increase in pore pressure associated with prolonged water recharge probably decades ago. The distribution of both previously mapped faults and newly mapped faults within the fields of deformation and the decay coefficient suggests that the faults disrupt the groundwater flow and partition the hydrological units. We also characterize human- and hydrological-triggered deformation by the features of seasonality and the deviation from the exponentially decaying model. By improving our ability to characterize aquifer structures, interferometric synthetic aperture radar analysis of surface deformation in combination with traditional hydrological monitoring data presents an opportunity to recognize and mitigate potential hazards.					; Wang, Teng/H-4767-2019; Lu, Zhong/MZQ-2483-2025	Lu, Zhong/0000-0001-9181-1818; Wang, Teng/0000-0003-3729-0139; Hu, Xie/0000-0002-6744-7291													2169-9003	2169-9011				JUN	2018	123	6					1257	1271		10.1029/2017JF004497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004497													WOS:000438207500005

Until now, little research has been conducted on the effects of microorganisms in soils for the formation of MeHg during different drying and flooding alternating conditions in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). This study aimed to understand how water level fluctuations affect soil microbial composition and mercury concentrations, and if such microbial variations are related to Hg methylation. The results showed that MeHg concentrations and the ratios of MeHg to THg (MeHg%) in soils were higher in the seasonally drying and flooding alternating areas (DFAs, 175-155 m) than those in the non-inundated (NIAs, > 175 m) and inundated areas (IAs, < 145 m). However, MeHg% in all samples was less than 1%, indicating that the Hg methylation activity in the soils of the TGR was under a low level. 454 high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed that soil bacterial abundance and diversity were relatively higher in DFA compared to those in NIA and IA, and microbial community composition varied in these three areas. At the family level, those groups in Deltaproteobacteria and Methanomicrobia that might have many Hg methylators were also showed a higher relative abundance in DFA, which might be the reason for the higher MeHg production in these areas. Overall, our results suggested that seasonally water level fluctuations can enhance the microbial abundance and diversity, as well as MeHg production in the TGR.

The results demonstrated that the short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) accounted for about 60 % of the total PFAA ( n-ary sumation PFAA) concentration in water, while long-chain PFAA were the dominant compounds in the sediment and SPM. The levels of the n-ary sumation PFAA and their precursors decreased from the estuaries to the bay, which implied that terrig-enous input (pollutant in land flowed into sea) was the main pollution source of PFAA in the LZB. The PFAAs levels in surface water were ranked as the order of dry > normal > wet season. The distribution coefficients of PFAA showed that the long-chain PFAA were more prone to be adsorbed by sediment and SPM than short-chain PFAA. The increase of n-ary sumation PFAA concentrations was in the range of 0.32-36.7 ng & BULL;L-1 after the oxidation conversion of water samples. Pre-cursors were the important source of the PFAA in the surface water. The perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant compound in fish tissues. These results provide hints for understanding PFAS pollution in LZB.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2023	890								164416	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164416		MAY 2023						37236489					WOS:001022302300001

Visualization of temporal change in soundscape power of a Michigan lake habitat over a 4-year period	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Soundscape Ecology is an emerging area of science that does not focus on the identification of species in the soundscape but attempts to characterize sounds by organizing them into those produced by biological organisms such as birds, amphibians, insects or mammals; physical environmental factors such as thunder, rainfall or wind; and sounds produced by human entities such as airplanes, automobiles or air conditioners. The soundscape changes throughout the day and throughout the seasons. The soundscape components that create the sound occur at different frequencies. A set of metrics termed soundscape power was computed and visualized to examine the patterns of daily and seasonal change in the soundscape. Automated recorders were used to record soundscape samples every half hour for one minute duration from six sites on an uninhabited island in Twin Lakes located near Cheboygan in Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula. Each recording was divided into 1 kHz frequency intervals and visualization tools were used to examine the soundscape power in each interval during 48 half-hour time segments from April-October for four consecutive years. Daily patterns of soundscape power change were also examined during the seven month sample period. To synthesize the data set, three dimensional contour plots were used to visualize day of the year (x), time of day (y) and soundscape power (z) for several frequency intervals. A further synthesis was developed to visualize soundscape change using a Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) which is a ratio of low to high frequencies. The visualization of the soundscape revealed discrete patterns in the soundscape including striking changes in the time of the occurrence of dawn and dusk choruses. The patterns in the soundscape were remarkably similar over the four-year investigation. Soundscape power in the lower frequency examined (1-2 kHz) was a dominant feature of the soundscape at Twin Lakes and the low frequency soundscape power was negatively correlated with higher frequency sounds. The soundscape power metrics and the visualizations of the soundscape produced in this study should provide a means of rapidly synthesizing large numbers of recordings into meaningful patterns to examine soundscape change. This is especially useful because of the need to develop indices of ecological metrics based on soundscape attributes to assist resource managers in making decisions about ecosystem integrity. Visualization can also be of immense benefit to examine patterns in large soundscape time series data sets that can be produced by automated recording devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The diversity of biochemical pathways involved in the acquisition, degradation, and synthesis of thiamin indicates that organisms have evolved numerous ecological strategies for meeting this nutritional requirement. In this review we synthesize information from multiple disciplines to show how the complex biochemistry of thiamin influences ecological outcomes of interactions between organisms in environments ranging from the open ocean and the Australian outback to the gastrointestinal tract of animals. We highlight population and ecosystem responses to the availability or absence of thiamin. These include widespread mortality of fishes, birds, and mammals, as well as the thiamin-dependent regulation of ocean productivity. Overall, we portray thiamin biochemistry as the foundation for molecularly mediated ecological interactions that influence survival and abundance of a vast array of organisms.

Ultraviolet (UV) photolysis, ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) and ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) treatments have been reported to decrease trace organic contaminants in drinking water. In this study, 20 common AAs in East Taihu (ET) Lake (the main drinking water source for the surrounding cities) were determined during one year (four seasons). The impacts of UV photolysis alone and two UV-advanced oxidation process (AOP) pre-treatments on the formation of aldehydes, nitriles and N-chloroaldimines during post-chlorination of water containing three of the most detected AAs (i.e. valine (Val), leucine (Leu) and isoleucine (Ile)) in ET Lake were investigated. Results showed that the two UV-AOPs significantly decreased the odorous by-product formation from AAs compared with UV photolysis alone. The formation of N-chloroaldimines was more easily controlled than that of aldehyde and nitrile. Furthermore, UV/H2O2 was more effective than UV/PS at pH = 5 and 7. At pH = 9, the two UV-AOPs had similar effects and did not perform very well. In addition, the UV-AOPs controlled the formation of odorous by-products effectively at Cl/AA (molar ratio of chlorine to amino acid) ratios of 2.4 and 3.0 but increased their formation at Cl/AA ratios of 0.8 and 1.2. Experiments in real water showed that UV/H2O2 was more suitable for controlling the off-flavor problem caused by chlorination of AAs in ET Lake. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the effects of water stratification and mixing on the aquatic microbial community dynamics in subtropical reservoirs. In this study, we explored vertical and seasonal patterns of microbial diversity in the Dongzhen Reservoir (southeast China). Quantitative PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, and 454 pyrosequencing were used for an in-depth characterization of the bacterial community across time (every three months for one year) and space (five different water depths). Our results indicated that thermal and oxygen stratification shaped the phylogenetic composition of microbial communities in the reservoir. There were significant differences in physical, chemical and microbiological parameters between epilimnion and hypolimnion (P < 0.05). The RNA: DNA ratios were significantly lower in epilimnion and metalimnion but rapidly increased in hypolimnion (P < 0.05), suggesting that microorganisms were more active at low temperatures, low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high TN/TP ratios. Redundancy analysis and pathway analysis revealed a complex interplay of various environmental and biological factors by explaining the spatiotemporal variations in bacterial communities. Adaptive reservoir management strategies should consider carefully the effects of water stratification and mixing, together with the distribution patterns of aquatic microorganisms.

The proportion of C-37:4 alkenone to total C-37 alkenones (%C-37:4) and the relative abundance of archaeol to caldarchaeol (ACE) are promising salinity indices in lacustrine settings. Developing regional calibrations for both indicators is challenging due to limited datasets and a poor understanding of the factors that influence them. Here we present %C-37:4 and ACE data collected from 55 lakes in mid-latitude Asia with a wide salinity range, to evaluate how well the two proxies can be correlated with salinity and to infer potential influencing factors. The %C-37:4 values only show a weak negative correlation with salinity from all investigated lakes. The occurrence of C-37:3 alkenone isomer and abnormal values in the alkenone C37/C38 ratio might signal species shifts or environmental factors that compromise the %C-37:4-salinity relationship in our data set. Seasonal bias in alkenone production could further obscure this %C-37:4-salinity relationship. A stronger relationship emerges after removing samples influenced by these factors: %C-37:4 = -8.56 * log(10) (salinity) + 80.6, r(2) = 0.62, n = 37; or %C-37:4 = -13.46 * log(10) (salinity) + 101.48, with uncertainty in both variables considered. The ACE values show a strong positive correlation with salinity from all investigated lakes: ACE = 2.27 * 10(-4)* salinity + 25.4, r(2) = 0.75, n = 68; or ACE = 1.86 * 10(-4)* salinity + 38.1, with uncertainty in both variables considered. However, substantial deviations of the ACE values in low salinity range (<60,000 mg/L) and majority of the ACE shift in the range of 60,000-100,000 mg/L suggest that the ACE primarily responds to Euryarchaeota/Archaea community changes when a salinity threshold is crossed. Accordingly, both lake salinity indicators have the potential to reconstruct past salinity changes when their influencing factors could be constrained, and the two independent proxies, when they are used together, could further refine salinity reconstructions.

Effects of the hippopotamus on the chemistry and ecology of a changing watershed	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Cross-boundary transfers of nutrients can profoundly shape the ecology of recipient systems. The common hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius, is a significant vector of such subsidies from terrestrial to river ecosystems. We compared river pools with high and low densities of H. amphibius to determine how H. amphibius subsidies shape the chemistry and ecology of aquatic communities. Our study watershed, like many in sub-Saharan Africa, has been severely impacted by anthropogenic water abstraction reducing dry-season flow to zero. We conducted observations for multiple years over wet and dry seasons to identify how hydrological variability influences the impacts of H. amphibius. During the wet season, when the river was flowing, we detected no differences in water chemistry and nutrient parameters between pools with high and low densities of H. amphibius. Likewise, the diversity and abundance of fish and aquatic insect communities were indistinguishable. During the dry season, however, high-density H. amphibius pools differed drastically in almost all measured attributes of water chemistry and exhibited depressed fish and insect diversity and fish abundance compared with low-density H. amphibius pools. Scaled up to the entire watershed, we estimate that H. amphibius in this hydrologically altered watershed reduces dry-season fish abundance and indices of gamma-level diversity by 41% and 16%, respectively, but appears to promote aquatic invertebrate diversity. Widespread human-driven shifts in hydrology appear to redefine the role of H. amphibius, altering their influence on ecosystem diversity and functioning in a fashion that may be more severe than presently appreciated.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011; Dawson, Todd/ABO-2712-2022	Stears, Keenan/0000-0003-1012-5838; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030; 													0027-8424					MAY 29	2018	115	22					E5028	E5037		10.1073/pnas.1800407115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800407115								29760056					WOS:000433283700012

Quantifying the capacity of N removal from aquatic systems can provide a scientific basis for establishing the relationship between N reduction and water quality objectives, quantifying pollution contributions from different sources, as well as recommending control measures. The Lake Taihu region in China has a dense river network and heavy N pollution; however, the capacity for permanent N removal by the river network is unknown. Here, we concurrently examined environmental factors and net N-2 flux from sediments of two rivers in the Lake Taihu region between July 2012 and May 2013, using membrane inlet mass spectrometry, and then established a regression model incorporating the highly correlated factors to predict the N removal capacity of the river network in the region. To test the applicability of the regression model, 21 additional rivers surrounding Lake Taihu were sampled between July and December 2013. The results suggested that water nitrate concentrations are still the primary controlling factor for net denitrification even in this high N loading river network, probably due to multicollinearity of other relevant factors, and thus can be used to predict N removal from aquatic systems. Our established model accounted for 78% of the variability in the measured net N-2 flux in these 21 rivers, and the total N removed through N-2 production by the river network was estimated at 4 x 10 (4) t yr(-1), accounting for about 43% of the total aquatic N load to the river system. Our results indicate that the average total N content in the river water discharged into Lake Taihu would be around 5.9 mg of N L-1 in the current situation, far higher than the target concentration of 2 mg of N L-1, given the total N load and the N removal capacity. Therefore, a much stronger effort is required to control the N pollution of the surface water in the region.

We conducted monthly sampling (from May 2015 to May 2016) at Datong, the most downstream non-tidal hydrological station along the Changjiang River. To monitor long-term POC variations, we developed a two-step POC algorithm for Landsat satellite data and calculated monthly POC flux during 2000-2016. Monthly POC flux ranged from a minimum of 1.4 x 10(4) t C in February 2016 to a maximum of 52.04 x 10(4) t C in May 2002, with a mean of 13.04 x 10(4) t C/month. At Datong, monthly POC flux was positively exponentially related to water flow (N = 118, R = 0.69, p < 0.01). In the wet season (May to October) with high water flow, a large amount of terrigenous POC was flushed into the Changjiang River. After the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), both POC concentration (R = 0.46, p < 0.01) and POC flux (R = 0.33, p < 0.01) significantly exponentially decreased during 2000-2016. After 2011 with regular operation of the TGD, POC transport at Datong showed relative stability and its seasonal difference became smaller. POC concentration from the TGD to Datong in the Changjiang mainstream (similar to 1000 km) was also derived from Landsat data, which was spatially varied with water flow, slope gradient, and watercourse width. This study improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of POC transport in the Changjiang mainstream, especially the influences of the TGD construction.

Successful studies of ecological processes in lakes require in-situ data that cover the relevant temporal scales from milliseconds to entire seasons. Temporal and spatial coverage requirements represent a non-trivial challenge in lake sciences, which have traditionally used sampling campaigns conducted from research vessels or anchored moorings. These come with various logistical tasks and impose constraints on data coverage. An open water platform can overcome many of these limitations by providing continuous access and a wide range of analytical capabilities in direct contact with the lake environment. A consortium of five partner institutions constructed a 10 x 10 m, open-water, multipurpose platform on Lake Geneva (Switzerland/France) for a broad range of limnological research. The LeXPLORE platform, anchored since February 2019 at a position reaching 110 m depth off the lake's north-shore, provides workspace for a large number of instruments and up to 16 staff working in parallel on individual or integrated multidisciplinary projects. The safe, dry and protected floating laboratory offers direct access to the lake environment for high-sensitivity, high-throughput analyses including those which might advance sensor technology. The platform provides flexible workspace for both high-resolution measurements and investigations of larger-scale external forcing. It thus supports multidisciplinary empirical research in limnology, atmospheric sciences, and remote sensing. This article describes the platform and how it will advance aquatic sciences. The large number of projects that have already requested access to the platform demonstrate the efficacy and necessity of the LeXPLORE concept.

J	Jiang, J; Lohman, RB				Jiang, Junle; Lohman, Rowena B.			Coherence-guided InSAR deformation analysis in the presence of ongoing land surface changes in the Imperial Valley, California	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												While the quality and availability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data has dramatically improved in recent years, InSAR analysis and interpretation remain challenging in actively deforming regions with extensive agricultural activities, where vegetation changes and soil moisture variability can degrade data quality or introduce confounding signals. Here we use Sentinel-1 satellite imagery for the Imperial Valley, California, over the period of 2015-2019 to explore how factors specific to land surface changes may impact InSAR time series and to resolve time-varying deformation due to tectonic processes and geothermal energy production. We examine the temporal variability of data quality, via interferometric phase coherence, at high spatial resolution, taking into account the observation that some agricultural fields lie fallow for long time intervals punctuated by periods of cultivation. This strategy allows us to better distinguish signals and noise associated with agricultural activities, shoreline changes, or surface soil conditions. A series of masking, interpolation, and filtering steps facilitate phase unwrapping, and the unwrapped, unfiltered product is then recovered, reducing artifacts from spatial filtering. We adopt model-based tropospheric corrections to improve time series results, particularly in regions with high topographic relief, along with the use of distributed reference points to render a more uniform error structure. We validate InSAR observations with continuous GPS where available and find that the estimates of average line-of-sight (LOS) velocity over the valley from InSAR and GPS agree to similar to 3 mm/yr in areas with good data coverage. Discrepancies between the two estimates often exist in areas with lower InSAR data quality; in better-constrained areas, they appear to reveal signals attributable to surficial processes occurring in the uppermost soil layers. We observe a diverse suite of natural signals over multiple spatial scales, including steady interseismic deformation, seasonal lake-level-modulated signals at the southeastern Salton Sea shore, and transient slow slip on the Superstition Hills fault. In addition, we observe complex deformation at four geothermal fields within the valley. Extensive subsidence at the Salton Sea geothermal field suggests spatial overlap of anthropogenic and tectonic deformation, interspersed with potential surficial signals. Geothermal sites at East Mesa, North Brawley, and Heber exhibit smaller-amplitude, more localized deformation, often with nonlinear temporal trends. Our analysis demonstrates the need to assess whether InSAR signals result from surficial changes or deeper sources, and produces robust ground deformation data in support of efforts to study subsurface processes, manage geothermal operations, and improve hazard assessments.

As a proxy for artificial environments, we modeled a typical reservoir in a Brazilian semiarid region using an ecosystem approach. We compared the role of native and non-native invasive species (NIS) in the food web, between dry and wet periods, and under the influence of an extreme drought period (from 2011 to 2015), simulating the variation in fish biomasses due to decreasing consumption. Key ecosystem groups were fishes (mainly NIS), birds, and insects. Nutrient cycling was dependent on invaders, while the trophic structure was detritus based during the drought. Biomass of detritivores was almost two times higher than herbivores, and native fish species decreased abruptly in response to invaders and volume variation. The dominance of low-trophic levels (TLII) and tilapia-Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) and other tilapiines-resulted from interactions among invaders, feeding behavior on benthos, and environmental seasonality, tending toward biotic homogenization ("benthification") at the ecosystem level. An increasing relevance of detritivores with cascading effects in ecosystems subject to drought, multiple introductions, and ubiquitous food sources has clear implications for the fisheries and the water quality.

Here we investigated the distribution and potential activity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria in thaw ponds in two types of eroding permafrost landscapes in subarctic Que A bec: peatlands and mineral soils. We hypothesized that methanotrophic community composition and potential activity differ regionally as a function of the landscape type and permafrost degradation stage, and locally as a function of depth-dependent oxygen conditions. Our analysis of pmoA transcripts by Illumina amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR showed that the communities were composed of diverse and potentially active lineages. Type I methanotrophs, particularly Methylobacter, dominated all communities, however there was a clear taxonomic separation between the two landscape types, consistent with environmental control of community structure. In contrast, methanotrophic potential activity, measured by pmoA transcript concentrations, did not vary with landscape type, but correlated with conductivity, phosphorus and total suspended solids. Methanotrophic potential activity was also detected in low-oxygen bottom waters, where it was inversely correlated with methane concentrations, suggesting methane depletion by methanotrophs. Methanotrophs were present and potentially active throughout the water column regardless of oxygen concentration, and may therefore be resilient to future mixing and oxygenation regimes in the warming subarctic.

We developed such a mesoscale modeling system, extending the atmospheric model WRF with the distributed hydrological model HMS in a fully coupled way. It includes explicit lateral groundwater and land surface flow parameterization schemes and two-way groundwater-unsaturated zone interaction by replacing the free drainage bottom boundary of WRF's Noah-LSM with a Fixed-head or Darcy-flux boundary condition. The system is exemplarily applied for the Poyang Lake basin (160,000 km(2)) and the period 1979-1986 using a two-nest approach covering East Asia (30 km) and the Poyang Lake basin (10 km) driven by ERA Interim. Stand-alone WRF effectively simulates temperature (bias 0.58 degrees C) and precipitation (bias 21-26%). Stand-alone HMS simulations provide reasonable streamflow estimates. A significant impact on the regional water balance was found if groundwater-unsaturated zone interaction is considered. But the differences between the two groundwater coupling approaches are minor. For the fully coupled model system, streamflow results strongly depend on the simulation quality for precipitation. Two-way interaction results in net upward water fluxes in up to 25% of the basin area after the rainy season. In total, two-way interaction increases basin averaged recharge amounts. The evaluation with CPC and GLEAM indicates a better performance of the fully coupled simulation. The impact of groundwater coupling on LSM and atmospheric variables differs. Largest differences occur for the variable recharge (26%), whereas for atmospheric variables, the basin-averaged impact is minor (< 1%). But locally, a spatial redistribution up to 65% occurs for precipitation.

Supraglacial ponds represent sinks within the discontinuous supraglacial drainage system, and occasionally drain englacially. To assess pond dynamics, we made pond water level measurements on Lirung Glacier, Nepal, during May and October of 2013 and 2014. Simultaneously, aerial, satellite, and terrestrial orthoimages and digital elevation models were obtained, providing snapshots of the ponds and their surroundings. We performed a DEM-based analysis of the glacier's closed surface catchments to identify surface drainage pathways and englacial drainage points, and compared this to field observations of surface and near-surface water flow. The total ponded area was higher in the pre-monsoon than post-monsoon, with individual ponds filling and draining seasonally associated with the surface exposure of englacial conduit segments. We recorded four pond drainage events, all of which occurred gradually (duration of weeks), observed diurnal fluctuations indicative of varying water supply and outflow discharge, and we documented instances of interaction between distant ponds. The DEM drainage analysis identified numerous sinks >3m in depth across the glacier surface, few of which exhibited ponds (23%), while the field survey highlighted instances of surface water only explicable via englacial routes. Taken together, our observations provide evidence for widespread supraglacial-englacial connectivity of meltwater drainage paths. Results suggest that successive englacial conduit collapse events, themselves likely driven by supraglacial pond drainage, cause the glacier surface drainage system to evolve into a configuration following relict englacial conduit systems. Within this system, ponds form in depressions of reduced drainage efficiency and link the supraglacial and englacial drainage networks.

It is, therefore, necessary to investigate the occurrence and fate of accumulated MPs in the sediments, which pose a risk to aquatic organisms. We conducted the first comprehensive investigation of MPs in riverine sediment in South Korea to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of MPs in the sediment at the two main branches and downstream of the Han River. The average abundance of MPs over all sites was 0.494 +/- 0.280 particles/g. Spatially, the MP abundance at three sites in the North Han River (0.546 +/- 0.217 particles/g) was higher than those in the South Han River (0.383 +/- 0.145 particles/g) and downstream of the Han River (0.417 +/- 0.114 particles/g). The abundances of MPs before dams at two upstream sites were significantly higher than that at other sites because of the slow river flow velocity attributed to the artificial structure. The abundance of MPs after the mosoon season (October, 0.600 +/- 0.357 particles/g) was higher than that before the mosoon season (April, 0.389 +/- 0.099 particles/g). The most common polymer types observed were polyethylene (>38%) and polypropylene (>24%). Irrespective of the location and season, greater than 93% of MPs identified were fragments, and the remaining were fibers. The concentrations of TOC, TN, and TP in the sediment were positively correlated with MP abundance. MP abun-dance was also positively correlated with clay and silt fractions of the sediment; however, it was negatively correlated with sand fraction. This study provides a basis for the management of MP pollution by offering findings related to critical factors influencing MP abundance in sediment.

Lake Ziway is a shallow freshwater lake found in the northern part of the Ethiopian Rift Valley. It is characterized as semi-arid to sub-humid type of climate. Expansions of the flower industry, widespread fisheries, intensive agricultural activities, fast population growth lead to deterioration of water quality and depletion of aquatic biota. The spatial and temporal variations of selected water quality parameters were evaluated using multivariate techniques. The data were collected from nine sampling stations during dry and wet seasonal basis for analysis of fifteen water quality parameters. The physicochemical parameters were measured in-situ with portable multimeter and nutrients were determined by following the standard procedures outlined in the American Public Health Association using UV/Visible spectrophotometer. Mean nutrient concentrations showed increasing trend in all seasons. These sites were also characterized by high electrical conductivity and total dissolved solid (TDS). All the nine sampling sites were categorized into three pollution levels according to their water quality features using cluster analysis (CA). Accordingly, sampling sites Fb and Ketar River (Kb) are highly and moderately polluted in both seasons, respectively. On the other hand, sampling sites at the center (C), Meki river mouth (Ma), Ketar river mouth (Ka), Meki River (Mb), Korekonch (K-o) and Fa in dry season and Ka, C, Ma, Ko, Bulbula river mouth (B) and Fa during wet season were less polluted. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis also showed the pollutant sources were mainly from Fb during dry season Mb and Kb during wet season. The values of comprehensive pollution index illustrated the lake is moderately and slightly polluted in dry and wet seasons, respectively. Comparatively, the pollution status of the lake is high around floriculture effluent discharge site and at the two feeding rivers (Kb and Mb) due to increasing trends in agrochemical loads. In order to stop further deterioration of the lake water quality and to eventually restore the beneficial uses of the lake, management of agrochemicals in the lake catchments should be given urgent priority.					; Hailu, Mekonen/JFL-1075-2023	Ayele, Dessie Tibebe/0000-0002-4779-7331; Kassa, Yezbie/0000-0001-5882-8677; 														2661-801X				MAR 14	2022	16	1							11	10.1186/s13065-022-00806-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13065-022-00806-0								35287705					WOS:000768849100001

It explores their occurrence, sources, transport behavior, and associated risks to human health and ecosystems. The results revealed that concentrations of n-ary sumation PAHs in dissolved phase and sediment with no significant seasonal differences. In contrast, n-ary sumation PAHs concentrations in suspended particulate matter were significantly higher during the ice-free period compared to the ice period. Spatially, the northern part of Lake Ulansuhai displayed higher PAHs content. Diagnostic isomeric ratios and PMF models indicated that the PAHs were primarily derived from combustion sources. The distribution of PAHs within water-sediment demonstrated that non-equilibrium status. Fugacity calculations indicated that 2-4 rings PAHs acted as secondary sources of sediment emissions. Toxicity assessment, indicated that PAHs posed no significant carcinogenic risk to humans. Risk quotient values showed that PAHs as low to high ecological risk.					zhe, liu/JDM-6103-2023														0025-326X	1879-3363				MAR	2024	200								116072	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116072		JAN 2024						38290363					WOS:001176623500001

The heavy metal concentration (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe. Mn, Zn, and Pb) in the water, sediment, and liver of two fish species (Oligosarcus spp. - carnivore and Chyphocarax yoga - detritivore) was analyzed at two sampling sites in the Sinos River, Brazil, during the four seasons. The highest heavy metals concentration was observed in the sediment, followed by water, and the lowest in fish. As the sediment was the major sink for pollution by metals in this river, it probably played an important role in the uptake of these metals by the detritivore species, which accumulated more metals in the liver than the carnivore species. Furthermore, the potential ecological risk was low for both sampling sites, showing the low metal contamination in this area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The paradigm of nutrient limitation by N and P is pervasively accepted, without considering the possibility of C limitation. However, our assumption that C might affect the aquatic biological composition, lacks fieldwork support. We tested the co-limitation of C/N/P on the growth of submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton in the Caohai Lake, a typical shallow karst lake in southwestern China. This study documented the seasonal variations in the concentration and comparative availability of nutrients C/N/P, in addition to physicochemical parameters, submerged macrophytes biomass, and phytoplankton composition in the lake. Our results show that dissolved inorganic carbon plays a substantial role in enhancing the primary production of phytoplankton and macrophytes, which suggests that primary production can be suppressed not only by P and/or N (as generally believed) but also by C, owing to the unique physicochemical characteristics that prevail in typical karst regions. Additionally, submerged macrophytes have been found to inhibit phytoplankton growth. Further analysis showed that the proportion of Cyanobacteria over Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta throughout the year was reduced at dissolved carbon dioxide/total nitrogen (CO2/TN) ratios (>0.2) and dissolved carbon dioxide/total phosphorus (CO2/TP) ratios (>10) in this study. Isotopic evidence further indicated that the abundance of Cyanobacteria was reduced when CO2 >30 mu mol/L. In summary, the combined results suggest that when controlling N and P, CO2 fertilization may significantly affect both the growth and composition of phytoplankton communities/submerged macrophytes and carbon sequestration in karst surface water ecosystems. This implies a new "paradigm" in the mitigation of cyanobacteria blooms by adding more CO2 to aquatic ecosystems with low pCO2, during which carbon sequestration may also be enhanced.					xinggen, liu/AAQ-6640-2020; Hu, Yundi/KLZ-3806-2024; Liu, Zaihua/K-2869-2013; ZHANG, YIFEI/GRO-0728-2022; He, Haibo/ABF-3668-2020	ma, ma song/0000-0003-1545-5043; Liu, Zaihua/0000-0002-6211-7357; He, Haibo/0000-0002-5398-8169; Qian, Bao/0000-0002-5230-7587													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2023	617		C						129111	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129111		JAN 2023											WOS:000923698700001

This study examined the relationship between LULC at buffer-zone scales and water quality in a lakeside city near Poyang Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in China. Representative indicators were selected by factor analysis to characterize the water quality in the study area, and then the association between LULC and water quality over space and time was quantified by redundancy analysis. The results indicated that the influence of LULC on water quality is scale-dependent. In general, the LULC could explain from 56.9% to 31.6% of the variation in water quality at six buffer zones (from 500 m to 1800 m). Forest land had a positive effect on water quality among most buffer zones, while construction land and bare land affected the representative water quality indicators negatively within the 1200 m and 1500 m buffer zones, respectively. There was also a seasonal variation in the relationship between LULC and water quality. The closest connection between them appeared at the 1000 m buffer zone in the dry season, whereas there was no significant difference among the buffer zones in the wet season. The results suggest the importance of considering buffer-zone scales in assessing the impacts of LULC on water quality in urban lakeshore areas.																				2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							47	10.3390/w12010047	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010047													WOS:000519847200047

In order to study the influence of water temperature on egg hatching into miracidia and the development from miracidia to cercariae, we incorporate time-dependent delays into the model to describe the maturation period and the extrinsic incubation period. We first introduce the basic reproduction number R-0 for this model and establish a threshold-type result on its global dynamics in terms of R-0. More precisely, we show that the disease is uniformly persistent when R-0 > 1, while the disease-free periodic solution is globally attractive when R-0 < 1. Then we choose parameters to fit the schistosomiasis epidemic data in Hubei province of China. Our numerical simulations indicate that the schistosomiasis will continue to prevail in the near future unless more effective control measures are taken. A further sensitive analysis demonstrates that the parameters with a strong impact on the outcome are baseline transmission rate, recovery rate, schistosome egg output rate, contact rate between miracidia and snails, and cercariae output rate.

Our results showed that the water quality (physicochemical parameters) of 2015 was better than 2012, which was benefited from Chinese government?s implementation of water pollution control measures. However, a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) based on phytoplankton FGs similarities did not show interannual differences correspondingly. This implied that the present improvements in water quality were insufficient to affect the interannual alterations of FGs. Among the 29 FGs identified, FGs P and TB were predominant in biomass, with sum proportion of 75%, while other FGs showed occasional advantages either seasonally or spatially, reflecting their randomness of exogenous inflows from water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. The diversity of dominant FGs could be good bioindicators to spatial and seasonal variations in water quality, since it showed apparently lower in high eutrophic conditions (around Guangzhou city or dry seasons), and higher when water quality was better (the West River side or wet seasons). Therefore, we assumed that continued efforts in improving water quality would finally enhance the diversity of dominant FGs in the study area. In conclusion, the phytoplankton FGs method is suitable for identifying the spatial and seasonal characteristics of aquatic environments greatly affected by human activities, but its sensitivity to interannual water quality improvements requires further investigation.

This study investigated seasonal variations of PFAS levels in two river catchments in Sweden; one impacted by Stockholm Arlanda Airport (Sites 1 and 2), and the other by WWTPs and a military airport (Uppsala) (Sites 3 and 4). Sigma PFAS concentrations were up to 61 (Sites 1 and 2) and 4 (Sites 3 and 4) times higher compared to the reference site. Distinct different seasonal trends were observed in the two catchments with higher Sigma PFAS concentrations during the high water flow season at Site 1 compared to the low water flow season, whereas Sites 3 and 4 showed an inverse seasonal trend. This demonstrates that the pollution is mobilized during periods of high flow in the first catchment (Stockholm Arlanda Airport), while it is diluted during high flow in the second catchment (Uppsala). Average annual loads for Sigma PFASs were estimated at similar to 5.2 and similar to 3.7 kg yr(-1) for the catchment in Uppsala and Stockholm Arlanda Airport, respectively. Thus, both catchments add PFASs to Lake Malaren, which is Sweden's most important source area for drinking water production.					; Ahrens, Lutz/S-6266-2019; Wiberg, Karin/AAB-5702-2021; Nguyen, Minh Anh/OGO-2144-2025	Wiberg, Karin/0000-0003-1427-7687; Ahrens, Lutz/0000-0002-5430-6764; 													0045-6535	1879-1298				DEC	2022	308		3						136467	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136467		SEP 2022						36116619					WOS:000890209200002

Spatio-temporal variability and the impact of Phailin on water quality of Chilika lagoon	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Chilika, Asia's largest brackish water lagoon was studied for 4 years (2011-2015) to understand the variability of water quality and the impact of a very severe cyclone storm "Phailin" (Category-5). During the study period environmental variables exhibited a significant variation among sectors, seasons, and years (p < 0.05, n=1440). Correlation matrix showed the major source of phosphate in Chilika were from in situ processes whereas, nitrate and silicate were from the riverine influx. Principal component analysis revealed that the biological factor and riverine flux mostly controlled the water quality. The overall 'water quality Index' indicated that the ecological health of the Chilika lagoon was "Good". The Phailin had a notable impact on water quality as substantiated by the trends of several parameters. The decrease in nitrate and phosphate after Phailin was attributed to dilution by low nutrient freshwater flux from major rivers whereas, the significant increase in reactive silicate was attributed to mixing of silicate enriched fresh water. Post Phailin increase in dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a was attributed to wind-induced mixing and resuspension of benthic chlorophyll respectively. A substantial change of nutrient stoichiometry and decrease in photic depth after Phailin resulted a pull down of primary productivity in the Chilika lagoon.

The Relationship Between Topography, Bedrock Weathering, and Water Storage Across a Sequence of Ridges and Valleys	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Bedrock weathering regulates nutrient mobilization, water storage, and soil production. Relative to the mobile soil layer, little is known about the relationship between topography and bedrock weathering. Here, we identify a common pattern of weathering and water storage across a sequence of three ridges and valleys in the sedimentary Great Valley Sequence in Northern California that share a tectonic and climate history. Deep drilling, downhole logging, and characterization of chemistry and porosity reveal two weathering fronts. The shallower front is similar to 7 m deep at the ridge of all three hillslopes, and marks the extent of pervasive fracturing and oxidation of pyrite and organic carbon. A deeper weathering front marks the extent of open fractures and discoloration. This front is 11 m deep under two ridges of similar ridge-valley spacing, but 17.5 m deep under a ridge with nearly twice the ridge-valley spacing. Hence, at ridge tops, the fraction of the hillslope relief that is weathered scales with hillslope length. In all three hillslopes, below this second weathering front, closed fractures and unweathered bedrock extend about one-half the hilltop elevation above the adjacent channels. Neutron probe surveys reveal that seasonally dynamic moisture is stored to approximately the same depth as the shallow weathering front. Under the channels that bound our study hillslopes, the two weathering fronts coincide and occur within centimeters of the ground surface. Our findings provide evidence for feedbacks between erosion and weathering in mountainous landscapes that result in systematic subsurface structuring and water routing.						Hahm, W.

The aim of this study is to investigate occurrence and distribution characteristics of PhACs in a typical small and medium-sized city in China and analyze their sources. 33 PhACs and 4 chiral drugs were selected for a four-season monitoring campaign in Wujin District Jiangsu Province, a typical small and median-sized city, in 2018. PhACs concentration level in surface water, ranging from ng L-1 to mu g L-1, was lower than in large-sized cities and areas in China. Impact from agricultural sources should be concerned in the study area: (1) Significant correlation between concentrations of antibiotics and NH4-N in surface water indicated the potential impact from agricultural sources (fishponds and livestock farms); (2) Government regulating measures on livestock and poultry farms since January 2018 have effectively decreased macrolides and lincosamides emissions into surface water. As for source analysis, CF/CBZ (Caffeine/Carbarnazepine) was a feasible indicator to trace untreated wastewater and enantiorrieric fraction values of metoprolol (MTP) were also suggested to be helpful for identifying untreated wastewater. The results of both two indicators indicated more input of untreated wastewater to surface water in the northeast area and upstream of Wuyi Canal. To our best knowl- edge, this is the first study to systematically analyze PhACs in aquatic environment for a small and medium-sized city in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, relatively little is known about their algal diet preferences. We studied grazing selectivity of small crustaceans (the cyclopoid copepods Mesocyclops leuckarti, Thermocyclops oithonoides, Cyclops kolensis, and the cladocerans Daphnia cucullata, Chydorus sphaericus, Bosmina spp.) by liquid chromatographic analyses of phytoplankton marker pigments in the shallow, highly eutrophic Lake Vortsjarv (Estonia) during a seasonal cycle. Copepods (mainly C. kolensis) preferably consumed cryptophytes (identified by the marker pigment alloxanthin in gut contents) during colder periods, while they preferred small non-filamentous diatoms and green algae (identified mainly by diatoxanthin and lutein, respectively) from May to September. All studied cladoceran species showed highest selectivity towards colonial cyanobacteria (identified by canthaxanthin). For small C. sphaericus, commonly occuring in the pelagic zone of eutrophic lakes, colonial cyanobacteria can be their major food source, supporting their coexistence with cyanobacterial blooms. Pigments characteristic of filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms (zeaxanthin and fucoxanthin, respectively), algae dominating in Vortsjarv, were also found in the grazers' diet but were generally avoided by the crustaceans commonly dominating the zooplankton assemblage. Together these results suggest that the co-occurring small-bodied cyclopoid and cladoceran species have markedly different algal diets and that the cladocera represent the main trophic link transferring cyanobacterial carbon to the food web in a highly eutrophic lake.

To this end, this paper investigated the spatio-seasonal pattern of hydrochemical evolution and surface water -groundwater interaction in a typical urban river basin (Dahei River basin) based on isotopic and hydrochemical data of 132 water samples collected during three seasons (normal, wet and dry seasons). From the normal season to the wet season, surface water in the Dahei River basin was dominated by the impacts of evaporation and groundwater discharge processes. During this period, the precipitation and agricultural activities (canal irrigation) were frequent. Thus, groundwater was affected by irrigation infiltration of surface water and precipitation from high -altitude areas. From the wet season to the dry season, precipitation decreased and irrigation methods changed (canal irrigation -> well irrigation). In this case, groundwater discharge had a stronger impact on surface water, and shallow groundwater was recharged by deep groundwater through the well irrigation. Under this hydrological pattern, the hydrochemical characteristics of surface water were mainly influenced by evaporation, human activities (agricultural irrigation and sewage treatment) and groundwater discharge. In contrast, the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater were main influenced by water -rock interactions (dissolution of evaporites and silicates, and cation exchange) and human activities. This study contributed to a better understanding of the hydrochemical and hydrological processes in urban river basins and provided a theoretical basis for the sustainable management of water resources.

Quantifying wildlife responses to conservation fencing in East Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The fencing of protected areas is increasing worldwide. However, the implementation of fences for conservation has outpaced scientific assessment of their effectiveness, non-target impacts, and long-term costs. We assessed landscape predictors of fence crossing sites and employed camera traps over a one-year period to investigate wildlife responses to a conservation fence around Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya. Specifically, we measured the impact of the fence on wild mammal movement, and the temporal impacts of fence maintenance on wildlife crossings and behavior. Cameras captured more than 65,000 detections of animals approaching fences, with 3626 observed crossings over 2818 trap nights at 19 sites. Using these data, we developed a guide to classifying fence-specific mammal behaviors. Thirty-eight wild mammal species approached known weak points in the fence, and 27 species were recorded crossing the fence. No single environmental variable predicted detection or fence crossing points for all species, but seasonality, human activity, habitat visibility, and proximity to an adjacent protected area were each correlated with species-specific crossing locations. Additionally, breaches of repaired fence-crossing locations occurred within days of maintenance. We conclude that popular, ?one-size-fitsall?, conservation fence designs may be ineffective and costly for restraining movement of many wildlife species. We recommend that those deploying conservation fences start with clearly articulated management goals, that fence maintenance be informed by taxa-specific tendencies to breach fences, and that managers consider the strategic creation of wildlife corridors, overpasses, or ungulate-proof fences to link fenced protected areas with surrounding habitat.

J	Onyutha, C				Onyutha, Charles			Trends and variability in African long-term precipitation	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												African precipitation trends are commonly analyzed using short-term data observed over small areas. This study analyzed changes in long-term (1901-2015) annual and seasonal precipitation of high spatial (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid) resolution covering the entire African continent. To assess an acceleration/deceleration of the precipitation increase/decrease, trend magnitude (mm/year) over the period 1991-2015 was subtracted from that of 1965-1990 to obtain Slope Difference (SD, mm/year). Co-variation of precipitation sub-trends with changes in large-scale ocean-atmosphere conditions was investigated. Regardless of the trend significance, in most parts of Africa, annual precipitation exhibited negative (positive) trends over the period 1965-1990 (1991-2015). Thus, the continent was, on average, recently (from 1991 to 2015) wetter than it was over the period 1965-1990. From 1901 to 2015, the null hypothesis H-0 (no trend) was rejected (p < 0.05) for annual precipitation decrease over West Africa especially along the coastal areas near the Gulf of Guinea. The H-0 was also rejected (p < 0.05) for the increase in annual and September-November precipitation of some areas along the Equatorial region (such as in Gabon and around Lake Victoria). For both annual and seasonal precipitation, the least SD values in the range - 1 to 1 mm/year were obtained in areas north of 10 degrees N. The SD value went up to about 20 mm/year over the Sahel belt especially for the peak monsoon (June-August season). For the March-May precipitation, positive SD values were obtained in the Western part of Southern Africa. However, negative SD values (around - 5 mm/year) were obtained in the Horn of Africa. Variation in sub-trends of the East African precipitation was found to be driven by changes in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Variability in sub-trends of the West African precipitation is linked to changes in SST of the Atlantic Ocean. Changes in sub-trends of the South African precipitation correspond to anomalies in SST from the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Knowledge of precipitation changes and possible drivers is vital for predictive adaptation regarding the impacts of climate variability on hydro- or agro-meteorology.

Dynamics of malaria vector composition and Plasmodium falciparum infection in mainland Tanzania: 2017-2021 data from the national malaria vector entomological surveillance	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background In 2015, Tanzania National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) established a longitudinal malaria vector entomological surveillance (MVES). The MVES is aimed at a periodical assessment of malaria vector composition and abundance, feeding and resting behaviours, and Plasmodium falciparum infection in different malaria epidemiological strata to guide the NMCP on the deployment of appropriate malaria vector interventions. This work details the dynamics of malaria vector composition and transmission in different malaria epidemiological strata.Methods The MVES was conducted from 32 sentinel district councils across the country. Mosquitoes were collected by the trained community members and supervised by the NMCP and research institutions. Three consecutive night catches (indoor collection with CDC light trap and indoor/outdoor collection using bucket traps) were conducted monthly in three different households selected randomly from two to three wards within each district council. Collected mosquitoes were sorted and morphologically identified in the field. Thereafter, the samples were sent to the laboratory for molecular characterization using qPCR for species identification and detection of P. falciparum infections (sporozoites). ELISA technique was deployed for blood meal analysis from samples of blood-fed mosquitoes to determine the blood meal indices (BMI).Results A total of 63,226 mosquitoes were collected in 32 district councils from January 2017 to December 2021. Out of which, 39,279 (62%), 20,983 (33%) and 2964 (5%) were morphologically identified as Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), Anopheles funestus s.l., and as other Anopheles species, respectively. Out of 28,795 laboratory amplified mosquitoes, 13,645 (47%) were confirmed to be Anopheles arabiensis, 9904 (34%) as An. funestus sensu stricto (s.s.), and 5193 (19%) as An. gambiae s.s. The combined average entomological inoculation rates (EIR) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.028-0.928) for An. gambiae s.s., 0.836 (95% CI 0.138-1.559) for An. arabiensis, and 0.58 (95% CI 0.165-0.971) for An. funestus s.s. with variations across different malaria transmission strata. Anopheles funestus s.s. and An. arabiensis were predominant in the Lake and South-Eastern zones, respectively, mostly in high malaria transmission areas. Monthly mosquito densities displayed seasonal patterns, with two peaks following the rainy seasons, varying slightly across species and district councils.Conclusion Anopheles arabiensis remains the predominant vector species followed by An. funestus s.s. in the country. Therefore, strengthening integrated vector management including larval source management is recommended to address outdoor transmission by An. arabiensis to interrupt transmission particularly where EIR is greater than the required elimination threshold of less than one (< 1) to substantially reduce the prevalence of malaria infection.

Greenland supraglacial lake drainages triggered by hydrologically induced basal slip	NATURE												Water-driven fracture propagation beneath supraglacial lakes rapidly transports large volumes of surface meltwater to the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet(1). These drainage events drive transient ice-sheet acceleration(1-3) and establish conduits for additional surface-to-bed meltwater transport for the remainder of the melt season(1,4-6). Although it is well established that cracks must remain water-filled to propagate to the bed(7-9), the precise mechanisms that initiate hydro-fracture events beneath lakes are unknown. Here we show that, for a lake on the western Greenland Ice Sheet, drainage events are preceded by a 6-12 hour period of ice-sheet uplift and/or enhanced basal slip. Our observations from a dense Global Positioning System (GPS) network allow us to determine the distribution of meltwater at the ice-sheet bed before, during, and after three rapid drainages in 2011-2013, each of which generates tensile stresses that promote hydro-fracture beneath the lake. We hypothesize that these precursors are associated with the introduction of meltwater to the bed through neighbouring moulin systems (vertical conduits connecting the surface and base of the ice sheet). Our results imply that as lakes form in less crevassed, interior regions of the ice sheet(10-14), where water at the bed is currently less pervasive(5,14-16), the creation of new surface-to-bed conduits caused by lake-draining hydro-fractures may be limited.					; Behn, Mark/F-5813-2012; King, Matt/B-4622-2008; Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008; Herring, Thomas/NPI-8957-2025	Herring, Thomas/0000-0002-6030-0545; Shean, David/0000-0003-3840-3860; Behn, Mark/0000-0002-2001-1335; King, Matt/0000-0001-5611-9498; Stevens, Laura A./0000-0003-0480-8018; Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X; 													0028-0836	1476-4687				JUN 4	2015	522	7554					73	U163		10.1038/nature14480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14480								26040890					WOS:000355543400031
J	Bodrato, M; Vione, D				Bodrato, Marco; Vione, Davide			APEX (Aqueous Photochemistry of Environmentally occurring Xenobiotics): a free software tool to predict the kinetics of photochemical processes in surface waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												The APEX software predicts the photochemical transformation kinetics of xenobiotics in surface waters as a function of: photoreactivity parameters (direct photolysis quantum yield and second-order reaction rate constants with transient species, namely (OH)-O-center dot, CO3-center dot, O-1(2) and the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter, (CDOM)-C-3*), water chemistry (nitrate, nitrite, bicarbonate, carbonate, bromide and dissolved organic carbon, DOC), and water depth (more specifically, the optical path length of sunlight in water). It applies to well-mixed surface water layers, including the epilimnion of stratified lakes, and the output data are average values over the considered water column. Based on intermediate formation yields from the parent compound via the different photochemical pathways, the software can also predict intermediate formation kinetics and overall yield. APEX is based on a photochemical model that has been validated against available field data of pollutant phototransformation, with good agreement between model predictions and field results. The APEX software makes allowance for different levels of knowledge of a photochemical system. For instance, the absorption spectrum of surface water can be used if known, or otherwise it can be modelled from the values of DOC. Also the direct photolysis quantum yield can be entered as a detailed wavelength trend, as a single value (constant or average), or it can be defined as a variable if unknown. APEX is based on the free software Octave. Additional applications are provided within APEX to assess the sigma-level uncertainty of the results and the seasonal trend of photochemical processes.

Treeline dynamics with climate change at the central Nepal Himalaya	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Treeline shifting in tandem with climate change has widely been reported from various parts of the world. In Nepal, several impacts of climate change on the physical environment have been observed, but study on the biological impacts is lacking. This dendrochronological study was carried out at the treeline in the high mountain slope of Kalchuman Lake (3750-4003 m a.s.l.) area of Manaslu Conservation Area in the central Nepal Himalaya to explore the impact of climate change on the treeline dynamic. Two belt transect plots (size: 20 m wide, > 250 m long) were laid which included treeline as well as tree species limit. Ecological mapping of all individuals of dominant trees Abies spectabilis and Betula utilis was done and their tree cores were collected. Stand character and age distribution revealed an occurrence of more matured B. utilis (max. age 198 years) compared to A. spectabilis (max. age 160 years). A. spectabilis contained an overwhelmingly high population (89%) of younger plants (< 50 years) indicating its high recruitment rate. Population age structure along the elevation gradient revealed an upward shifting of A. spectabilis at the rate of 2.61 m year(-1) since AD 1850. The upper distribution limit of B. utilis was found to be stagnant in the past few decades. An increment in plant density as well as upward shifting in the studied treeline ecotones was observed. The temporal growth of A. spectabilis was correlated negatively with the monthly mean and minimum temperature of June to September of the current and previous year. The regeneration of A. spectabilis, on the other hand, was positively correlated with August precipitation and monthly maximum temperature of the month of the current year. The growth and regeneration of A. spectabilis was more sensitive to maximum and minimum temperature rather than average temperature. The growth of the B. utilis was mainly limited by moisture stress during the pre-monsoon season. As these two species presented species-specific responses to climate change with differential pattern in regeneration condition, much wider differences are anticipated in their population status as climate continues to change throughout the century.					; Gaire, Narayan/AAL-6422-2020	Koirala, Madan/0000-0003-1413-3915; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2014	10	4					1277	1290		10.5194/cp-10-1277-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-10-1277-2014													WOS:000339896100001

During this project, the grid size has been reduced from 10 to 1 km, the evaluation of the interpolation has been improved, and comparisons between different methods has been performed. The climate variables of interest were monthly mean temperature and mean precipitation, for which the spatial variability was explained using auxiliary information: mean elevation, sea percentage, and lake percentage. We compared three methods for spatial prediction: kriging with external drift (KED), generalized additive models (GAM), and GAM combined with residual kriging (GK). Every interpolation file now has attached statistical key figures describing the bias and the normality of the prediction error. According to the cross-validation results, GAM was the best method for predicting mean temperatures, with only very small differences relative to the other methods. For mean precipitation, KED produced the most accurate predictions, followed by GK. In both cases, there was notable seasonal variation in the statistical skill scores. For the new reference period and future interpolations, KED was chosen as the primary method due to its robustness and accuracy.

Satellite tracking and stable isotope analysis highlight differential recruitment among foraging areas in green turtles	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Identifying links between breeding and non-breeding sites in migratory animals is an important step in understanding their ecology. Recognising the relative importance of foraging areas and ascertaining site-specific levels of recruitment can provide fundamental and applied insights. Here, satellite telemetry and the stable isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34) of 230 green turtles Chelonia mydas from a regionally important rookery in northern Cyprus were employed to evaluate the relative importance of 4 foraging areas. A preliminary analysis of stable isotope ratios suggested that a major foraging area had been missed through satellite telemetry as a large proportion of turtles had isotope ratios that did not correspond to sites previously identified. Stable isotope ratios were then employed to select 5 turtles to be fitted with platform terminal transmitters in 2015. All 5 turtles were subsequently tracked to the same location, Lake Bardawil in Egypt. Serially collected tissue samples from 45 females, ranging over 2 to 4 breeding seasons, suggested that foraging site fidelity was very common, with 82% of females exhibiting extremely high temporal consistency in isotope ratios. Quantifying fidelity allowed an evaluation of foraging area specific contributions to each breeding cohort over the past 2 decades and demonstrated that recruitment was unequal among sites, and dynamic over time, with Egypt now currently the major contributor to the nesting aggregation. This work demonstrates the utility of stable isotope analysis to elucidate the spatial ecology of cryptic taxa and illustrates how more robust baselines can be assembled against which to measure the success of future marine conservation initiatives.					; Inger, Richard/D-3445-2009; Carreras, Carlos Carreras Huer/B-6772-2012; Carreras, Carlos/B-6772-2012; Godley, Brendan/A-6139-2009; Fuller, Wayne/ISV-5790-2023; Broderick, Annette/A-4062-2013; godley, brendan/A-6139-2009	Broderick, Annette/0000-0003-1444-1782; Inger, Richard/0000-0003-1660-3706; Carreras, Carlos/0000-0002-2478-6445; godley, brendan/0000-0003-3845-0034													0171-8630	1616-1599				NOV 6	2017	582						201	214		10.3354/meps12297	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps12297													WOS:000414581400014

Here we target a mesoscale tectonically stable mountainous river, the Minjiang River, in southeast China. We present petrography, heavy minerals, and Sr-Nd isotopic data from suspended particulate matter (SPM) and riverbed sediments to characterize sediment-climate feedback processes. Results show Sr-Nd isotopic compositions of the SPM vary seasonally, corresponding well with the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation. River sands display low compositional and textural maturity and represent first cycle-dominated and fast-transported detritus. Provenance analysis suggests prominent contributions of upstream Proterozoic-Paleozoic rocks to downstream SPM and riverbed sediments. We propose that climate-induced hydrological variations exert a major control on sediment supply, transport, and compositions. Our study highlights the crucial role of climate in driving physical erosion of mountains in tectonically stable, subtropical East Asia. Plain Language Summary The subtropical-tropical rivers in East and South Asia, particularly those draining mountains, account for a significant proportion of global sediment and nutrient exports. Based on tectonic settings, river basin morphology, climatic conditions, and extents of anthropogenic impacts, two distinct types of sediment supply and transport regimes in the low-middle latitudes of East Asia have been identified. Type 1 rivers are large rivers on the tectonically stable continent with slow, multicycled sediment transport, modulated by widespread flood plains, lakes, and human activities. Type 2 rivers are small mountainous rivers on tectonically active plate boundaries with rapid sediment transport, which are commonly triggered by extreme tectonic and climatic events. However, sediment transport mechanisms of the mountainous rivers in the tectonically stable, subtropical regions remain highly enigmatic. We combined petrology and geochemistry methods to track sediment sources of the Minjiang River (southeast China) and to characterize river sediment transfer processes. We find that hydroclimate changes, rather than anthropogenic forcings, exhibit the major control on discharged sediment compositions. We suggest that the mesoscale, tectonically stable, mountainous rivers have similar rapid sediment transport behavior to those small mountainous river systems, unlike other large river systems in subtropical East Asia.					; Yang, Shouye/D-4820-2013; Zhang, Wei/JTU-8118-2023; Kao, Shuh-Ji/F-8418-2015	Jian, Xing/0000-0002-9499-5998; Yang, Shouye/0000-0002-4810-6598; Kao, Shuh-Ji/0000-0002-5054-9099													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 16	2020	47	3							e2019GL086150	10.1029/2019GL086150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL086150													WOS:000529107400075

This study evaluated, for the first time, the identification, abundance, and distribution of MP particles in the surface water of Luruaco Lake, in the low basin of the Magdalena River, Colombia, included in national programs in marine sciences and hydrobiological resources. Six stations and four samplings were established in the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 72 water samples were collected for microplastic extraction using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) digestion, density separation with sodium chloride solution (NaCl), and filtration. The abundance of MPs ranged from 0 to 3.83 MPs center dot L-1, with an average of 1.90 MPs center dot L-1 in the rainy season and 0.25 MPs center dot L-1 in the dry season. According to the calculated coefficient of microplastics impact, the contamination in the surface water of Luruaco Lake is "maximum" to "extreme" for fibers with an average length of 2.05 mm and "minimum" to "average" for fragments that are 0.35 mm in size on average. Polyester (PES, 57.9%), polystyrene (PS, 47.0%), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 35.3%) polymers were more abundant in surface water. The temporal variation of the MPs indicates contamination related to the discharges of the tributary streams to the lake in the rainy season.

Observations of two reservoirs during a drought in central Texas, USA: Strategies for detecting harmful algal blooms	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Problems associated with eutrophication are increasing in freshwater reservoirs worldwide due to many factors, the majority of which are attributed directly to human development. Eutrophic bodies of water are much more susceptible to algal blooms, including potentially harmful species, as well as associated taste-and-odor compounds and toxic secondary metabolites. To assess the likelihood of eutrophication and harmful blooms, two reservoirs in the Highland Lakes of central Texas, which are located within the same drainage basin and climate zone, were observed for the duration of an extended drought period lasting from 2010 to 2015. This brief investigation examined a suite of physiochemical characteristics to determine which environmental factors had the most significant impacts on the eutrophication of a reservoir coupled with the abundance of microalgae. Standard water quality parameters that have been hypothesized to influence eutrophication were measured and compared with chlorophyll-a fluorescence as a proxy for phytoplankton abundance. Samples were taken every other month and each reservoir responded differently to the drought - Lake Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) became eutrophic while Lake Travis remained mesotrophic, according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. Linear models using corrected Akaike Information Criterion analyses indicated that the primary indicators for microalgae in Lake LBJ were organic and inorganic nitrogen, but the indicators for Lake Travis were rainfall, chloride, sulfate, and conductivity. Preserved phytoplankton samples were analyzed from both reservoirs across seasons in 2013 and 2014 to supplement the models. Cyanobacteria were a significant factor in both lakes - samples indicated that the diazotroph and harmful genus, Aphanizomenon, was the most abundant cyanobacterium in Lake LBJ, while Limnothrix was dominant in Lake Travis. Although diazotrophic, it was hypothesized that Aphanizomenon used free nitrogen when available rather than fixing atmospheric nitrogen, thus allowing for rapid establishment and leaving less free nitrogen for plankton downstream. This study indicated that an increase in inorganic and organic nitrogen following a period of drought could amplify the potential for harmful blooms of Aphanizomenon in the upper Highland Lakes of central Texas.

Hydrological Response to Climate Change for Gilgel Abay River, in the Lake Tana Basin - Upper Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia	PLOS ONE												Climate change is likely to have severe effects on water availability in Ethiopia. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of climate change on the Gilgel Abay River, Upper Blue Nile Basin. The Statistical Downscaling Tool (SDSM) was used to downscale the HadCM3 (Hadley centre Climate Model 3) Global Circulation Model (GCM) scenario data into finer scale resolution. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up, calibrated, and validated. SDSM downscaled climate outputs were used as an input to the SWAT model. The climate projection analysis was done by dividing the period 2010-2100 into three time windows with each 30 years of data. The period 1990-2001 was taken as the baseline period against which comparison was made. Results showed that annual mean precipitation may decrease in the first 30-year period but increase in the following two 30-year periods. The decrease in mean monthly precipitation may be as much as about -30% during 2010-2040 but the increase may be more than +30% in 2070-2100. The impact of climate change may cause a decrease in mean monthly flow volume between -40% to -50% during 2010-2040 but may increase by more than the double during 2070-2100. Climate change appears to have negligible effect on low flow conditions of the river. Seasonal mean flow volume, however, may increase by more than the double and +30% to +40% for the Belg (small rainy season) and Kiremit (main rainy season) periods, respectively. Overall, it appears that climate change will result in an annual increase in flow volume for the Gilgel Abay River. The increase in flow is likely to have considerable importance for local small scale irrigation activities. Moreover, it will help harnessing a significant amount of water for ongoing dam projects in the Gilgel Abay River Basin.					; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015	Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Setegn, Shimelis Gebriye/0000-0002-7603-9505													1932-6203					OCT 24	2013	8	10							e79296	10.1371/journal.pone.0079296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079296								24250755					WOS:000326152300091

Dail			Spatiotemporal diversity and community structure of cyanobacteria and associated bacteria in the large shallow subtropical Lake Okeechobee (Florida, United States)	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Lake Okeechobee is a large eutrophic, shallow, subtropical lake in south Florida, United States. Due to decades of nutrient loading and phosphorus rich sediments, the lake is eutrophic and frequently experiences cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs). In the past, surveys of the phytoplankton community structure in the lake have been conducted by morphological studies, whereas molecular based studies have been seldom employed. With increased frequency of cyanoHABs in Lake Okeechobee (e.g., 2016 and 2018 Microcystis-dominated blooms), it is imperative to determine the diversity of cyanobacterial taxa that exist within the lake and the limnological parameters that drive bloom-forming genera. A spatiotemporal study of the lake was conducted over the course of 1 year to characterize the (cyano)bacterial community structure, using 16S rRNA metabarcoding, with coincident collection of limnological parameters (e.g., nutrients, water temperature, major ions), and cyanotoxins. The objectives of this study were to elucidate spatiotemporal trends of community structure, identify drivers of community structure, and examine cyanobacteria-bacterial relationships within the lake. Results indicated that cyanobacterial communities within the lake were significantly different between the wet and dry season, but not between periods of nitrogen limitation and co-nutrient limitation. Throughout the year, the lake was primarily dominated by the picocyanobacterium Cyanobium. The bloom-forming genera Cuspidothrix, Dolichospermum, Microcystis, and Raphidiopsis were highly abundant throughout the lake and had disparate nutrient requirements and niches within the lake. Anatoxin-a, microcystins, and nodularins were detected throughout the lake across both seasons. There were no correlated (cyano)bacteria shared between the common bloom-forming cyanobacteria Dolichospermum, Microcystis, and Raphidiopsis. This study is the first of its kind to use molecular based methods to assess the cyanobacterial community structure within the lake. These data greatly improve our understanding of the cyanobacterial community structure within the lake and the physiochemical parameters which may drive the bloom-forming taxa within Lake Okeechobee.

The driving mechanisms of this long-term variability are unclear due to a lack of full-period climate reconstructions. In particular, reconstructions of the terrestrial environment are rare, especially reconstructions representing South China during the early Mesozoic period. We focused on the major, trace and rare earth element compositions and clay mineralogy of 173 mudstones from the northern margin of the South China Plate. These data were used as proxies to evaluate the weathering intensity and reconstruct the climate variability from the Middle Triassic to the Late Jurassic after considering the potential effects of provenance, diagenesis and sedimentary sorting and recycling. From the latest part of the Triassic to the early Middle Jurassic, five well-correlated chemical weathering indices, the chemical index of alteration (CIA), chemical index of weathering (CIW), plagioclase index of alteration (PIA), sodium depletion index (tau Na) and weathering index of Parker (WIP), imply an advanced degree of chemical weathering (e.g., CIAcorr, the corrected CIA, ranging from 71.1 to 88.0) and a clay mineral assemblage zone with abundant kaolinite. Together, these findings indicate a dominant humid climate. In the pre-Late Triassic and post-Middle Jurassic, the dominant seasonally arid climate was characterized by low and widely variable chemical weathering index values (e.g., CIAcorr values of 59.4-85.4) and clay mineral assemblage zones containing chlorite, smectite and mixed-layer illite-smectite but less kaolinite. We suggest that PCO2 variations, the megamonsoon effect, plate motion and regional topography all contributed to the observed climate changes during the early Mesozoic.

J	Zhang, M; Tian, YH; Zhao, M; Yin, B; Zhu, ZL				Zhang, Min; Tian, Yuhua; Zhao, Miao; Yin, Bin; Zhu, Zhaoliang			The assessment of nitrate leaching in a rice-wheat rotation system using an improved agronomic practice aimed to increase rice crop yields	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												To increase the rice yield and nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE), an integrated agronomic practice, including rapeseed cake addition, increased fertilizer frequency, improved irrigation and crop cultivation management, was adopted in the Taihu Lake region of China. The environmental impacts of the whole rice-wheat rotation system have not yet been fully evaluated. Here, a two-rotation field trail system was used to assess the effects of the improved practice adopted in rice season on crop yield and nitrate (NO3--N) leaching in the rice-wheat rotation. Four treatment conditions were used control (CK), conventional (CT), reduced N (RT), and improved (IP). During the rice season, the leaching losses of NO3--N in the IP treatment group (2.29-3.88 kg N ha(-1)) were lower than those in the CT treatment group (4.11-5.38 kg N ha(-1)), and the former had a 28.55% higher crop yield than the latter. Similarly, the RT treatment had lower N leaching loss and a 9.32% higher rice crop yield than the CT treatment. In the wheat seasons, the CT treatment had 41.83% and 38.03% higher NO3--N leaching than the RT and IP treatments, respectively, despite the three treatments having the same fertilizer application and field management; and N leaching was strongly affected by chemical N surplus in rice season. The RT treatment had the lowest wheat yield, which was 18.72% and 32.06% lower than the CT and IP treatments, respectively; and wheat yield appeared an exponentially increasing response to N surplus that included organic fertilizer N from rice production. These results indicated that management practices applied in rice season had subsequent effect on N leaching and crop yield of the following wheat season. During the whole rice wheat rotation system, the IP treatment produced 23.56% higher crop yield and 30.87% lower TN leaching than the CT treatment. The IP treatment also increased chemical NUE by 24.67-31.22% and agronomic efficiency of applied chemical N (AEN) by 17.71-33.4% compared with the CF and RT treatments. Thus, compared with traditional practice and reduced N use management, the improved practice management was more in line with the target of food increase and environmental protection.

Using Signature Genes as Tools To Assess Environmental Viral Ecology and Diversity	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Viruses (including bacteriophages) are the most abundant biological entities on the planet. As such, they are thought to have a major impact on all aspects of microbial community structure and function. Despite this critical role in ecosystem processes, the study of virus/phage diversity has lagged far behind parallel studies of the bacterial and eukaryotic kingdoms, largely due to the absence of any universal phylogenetic marker. Here we review the development and use of signature genes to investigate viral diversity, as a viable strategy for data sets of specific virus groups. Genes that have been used include those encoding structural proteins, such as portal protein, major capsid protein, and tail sheath protein, auxiliary metabolism genes, such as psbA, psbB, and phoH, and several polymerase genes. These marker genes have been used in combination with PCR-based fingerprinting and/or sequencing strategies to investigate spatial, temporal, and seasonal variations and diversity in a wide range of habitats.

J	Read, JS; Rose, KC				Read, Jordan S.; Rose, Kevin C.			Physical responses of small temperate lakes to variation in dissolved organic carbon concentrations	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used a mechanistic physical model to examine the effect of variability in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations on the physical properties of small temperate lakes. The model was validated on eight small (6 X 10(-4) to 3.8 X 10(-2) km(2)) lakes in Wisconsin and Michigan, with a standard error < 1 degrees C for seven of eight lakes. Attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) in these lakes was regulated by DOC concentrations and was important in the vertical structuring of water temperatures. Heat exchange below the surface mixed layer was near the molecular rate, increasing the importance of water clarity as a control on the heat content of deeper waters. To understand the thermal effects of changing DOC concentrations, we applied scenarios of a 50% increase and 50% decrease in DOC concentrations for one lake (Trout Bog) and found water temperatures to vary in response, with the seasonally averaged temperatures in the increased DOC scenario being > 2 degrees C colder than the reduced scenario. We found a nonlinear relationship between DOC and temperature, with clearer (lower DOC) simulations being more sensitive to climate variability, suggesting that DOC may act as a buffer against a warming climate. Our model showed that DOC also influenced epilimnetic depths, as nocturnal mixing (related to the vertical partitioning of heat) was more important than wind-driven mixing. Small lakes are globally important regulators of biogeochemical cycles and are structurally different from larger lakes. Important feedbacks to physical processes must be accounted for when understanding the effects of changing DOC and climate on small lakes.

Dams and the fish fauna of the Neotropical region: impacts and management related to diversity and fisheries	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Reservoirs have been built in almost all of the hydrographic basins of Brazil. Their purposes include water supply for cities, irrigation and mainly, generation of electricity. There are more than 700 large dams and associated reservoirs in the large rivers of the country. These reservoirs favor local and regional economic development, but they also bring serious and irreversible alterations in the natural hydrologic regime of rivers, affecting habitat quality and the dynamics of the biota. In the impounded area, the main impact is the change from lotic to lentic water, which influences aquatic fauna, including fishes. Impacts of reservoirs present relevant spatiotemporal variations. Immediately after reservoir formation, fish species richness usually increases due to incorporation of surrounding habitats, but richness decreases as reservoirs age. However, impacts downstream of dams appear to be similar or stronger than those that occur within the reservoir. Dams promote discharge control, altering the seasonal cycles of floods. These effects are augmented when dams are constructed in cascades. Therefore, dams profoundly influence composition and structure of fish assemblages. Most affected species are the rheophilics and long distance migratory that require distinct habitats to fulfill their life cycles. Populations of migratory species may collapse or even disappear in intensely regulated stretches. Management actions taken to minimize impacts of darns in Brazil historically considered construction of fish passages, fishery control and stocking. The results of these actions are questionable and/or with clear failures. In this paper, we give emphasis to the Parana River basin, the most affected by dams in Brazil. We describe some patterns in the alteration and decline in fish diversity in areas influenced by darns. We also discuss negative consequences in the fishery and ecosystems functioning. Finally, we argue the relevance and the Success of the management actions taken and present some suggestions to improve conservation of the ichthyofauna in South American basins influenced by dams.					; Franco, Fernando/E-5599-2017; Pelicice, Fernando/D-8768-2013; Agostinho, Angelo/S-1538-2019; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/D-5888-2013	gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Franco, Fernando/0000-0002-0808-7791; Pelicice, Fernando/0000-0002-9700-1194; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444													1519-6984	1678-4375				NOV	2008	68	4		S			1119	1132		10.1590/S1519-69842008000500019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842008000500019								19197482					WOS:000263206600019

To explore the maximum potential of GHG mitigation without sacrificing economic returns, we investigated the GHG emissions, crop yields and economic returns over two years in three rice-cropping systems (rice-wheat, RW; rice-fava bean, RB; and rice-fallow, RF). Different N fertilization levels and straw incorporation methods were employed in each of the rice-cropping systems at the study site, in the Taihu Lake region (TLR) of China. Bean straw produced in the RB system was fermented aerobically before incorporation, while straws produced in the RW and RF systems were directly incorporated into the soils. Relative to the traditional RW system, methane emissions during the rice seasons were significantly reduced by 29-44% in the RB system; annual N inputs were reduced by 43%; annual nitrous oxide emissions for N fertilization treatments were decreased by 56-69%; and the average rice yield was increased by 5.2%. As a, result, the GHG intensity (GHGI) was significantly reduced by 11-41%, and the annual net economic benefit (NEB) was increased by 22-94%. Compared with the RW system, the GHGI in the RF system was increased by 8-30% and the NEB was decreased by 3-33%. Considering the current rice/wheat production practices employed in the TLR, the GHGI could be reduced by 26% while the NEB could be improved by 23%, with an annual reduction in the N application rate (currently 525 kg N ha(-1)) by 20% and the conversion of the RW systems into RB systems that use straw fermentation. The results of this study suggest that high economic return and GHG mitigation could be simultaneously achieved by the integrated adoption of reasonable reduction in N application rates, the use of appropriate rice-cropping systems and by employing eco-friendly straw management.

Climate change leads to a doubling of turbidity in a rapidly expanding Tibetan lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Recent climate change is causing most lakes on the Tibetan Plateau to grow at an unprecedented rate. Changes in the physical properties and water storage of the lakes are now relatively well documented. Yet the impacts on their water quality remain poorly understood. Turbidity is a well-established optical water-quality indicator related to suspended particulate matter concentration which can affect vertical light attenuation and ecosystem functioning. Here, we use remotely sensed data to assess the seasonal and long-term variations in turbidity in Siting Lake, one of the fastest growing lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, and to identify potential driving mechanisms of this change. The lake experiences two distinct peaks of turbidity during the year: one in August (warm season) caused by the seasonal influx of sediments from the Zagya Zangbo River, and one in December (cold season) caused by the wind-driven resuspension of sediments along the lakes' shorelines. The analysis further revealed a persistent increasing trend that doubled the average lake turbidity between 2000 and 2017. Evidence suggests this rise in turbidity results from a climate-driven increase in sediment supply from the Zagya Zangbo River, and from sediment resuspension associated with the erosion of shorelines recently submerged during the rapid expansion of the lake (paleoshorelines). Our results highlight the vulnerability of the Tibetan Lakes water quality to climate change. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, a temperate glacial region located in the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau is selected to analyse the characteristics of O-18 and D in different water sources and the contribution of glacier-snow meltwater to streamflow. The results indicate that the O-18 of river water ranges from -16.2 parts per thousand to -10.2 parts per thousand with a mean of -14.1 parts per thousand and that the D values range from -117.0 parts per thousand to -68.0 parts per thousand with a mean of -103.1 parts per thousand. These values are more negative than those of glacier-snow meltwater but less negative than those of precipitation. The d-excess values are found to decrease from meltwater to river to lake/reservoir water as a result of evaporation. On the basis of hydrograph separation, glacier-snow meltwater accounts for 51.5% of river water in the Baishui catchment in the melting season. In the Yanggong catchment, snow meltwater contributes 47.9% to river water in the premonsoon period, and glacier meltwater contributes only 6.8% in the monsoon period. The uncertainty in hydrograph separation is sensitive to the variation of tracer concentrations of streamflow components. The input of meltwater to a water system varies with local climate and glacier changes. The results confirm that hydrograph separation using water isotopes is valuable for evaluating the recharge sources of rivers, especially in ungauged glacial regions. This study provides insights into the hydrological processes of glacial catchments on the Tibetan Plateau, which is important for water resource management.					; Niu, Hewen/AHC-3884-2022; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018	Niu, Hewen/0000-0001-7804-217X; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; Pu, Tao/0000-0002-1876-1487													0885-6087	1099-1085				OCT 30	2017	31	22					3810	3826		10.1002/hyp.11293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11293													WOS:000413374400005

High late Miocene-Pliocene elevation of the Zhada Basin, southwestern Tibetan Plateau, from carbonate clumped isotope thermometry	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The timing and pattern of Tibetan Plateau rise provide a critical test of possible mechanisms for the development and support of high topography, yet views range widely on the history of surface uplift to modern elevations of similar to 4.5 km. To address this issue we present clumped isotope thermometry data from two well-studied basins in central and southwestern Tibet, for which previous carbonate delta O-18 data have been used to reconstruct high paleoelevations from late Oligocene to Pliocene time. Clumped isotope thermometry uses measurements of the C-13-O-18 bond ordering in carbonates to constrain the temperature [T(Delta(47))] and delta O-18 value of the water from which the carbonate grew. These data can be used to infer paleoelevation by exploiting the systematic decrease of surface temperature and the delta O-18 value of meteoric water with elevation, provided samples record original depositional conditions and appropriate context exists for interpreting T(Delta(47)) and delta O-18 values. Previous calcite delta O-18 and delta C-13 values for Oligocene-age marls from the Nima Basin in central Tibet are thought to reflect original depositional conditions; however, T(Delta 47) values exceed Earth-surface temperatures, indicating that the samples have been diagenetically altered. Maximum burial temperatures were not high enough to cause solid-state C-O bond reordering. Instead, the elevated T(Delta(47)) and water delta O-18 values are consistent with recrystallization of the samples in a rock-buffered system. Miocene-Pliocene aragonitic gastropod shells from the Zhada Basin in southwestern Tibet record primary environmental temperatures, which we interpret in the context of modern shell and tufa T(Delta(47)) values and lake water temperatures. Modern shell and tufa T(Delta(47)) values are similar to warm-season water temperatures. The ca. 9-4 Ma shell temperatures are significantly colder, suggesting a 9 +/- 3 degrees C (2 sigma) average increase in warm-season lake water temperatures since the late Miocene. If the temperature increase is due entirely to elevation change and the modern June-July-August (JJA) surface water lapse rate of 6.1 degrees C/km applies, it implies >1 km of elevation loss since the late Miocene-Pliocene-corresponding to an average basin floor paleoelevation of 5.4 +/- 0.5 km (2 sigma). A warmer mid-Pliocene climate would make this a minimum estimate. Our finding of cold paleotemperatures contrasts with previous conclusions based on Pliocene snail shell T(Delta 47) data interpreted in the absence of modern shell and water temperature data, but is consistent with delta O-18-based paleoaltimetry and with paleontological and isotopic data indicating the presence of coldadapted mammals living in a cold, high-elevation climate. We suggest that late Neogene elevation loss across the Zhada Basin catchment probably related to local expression of east-west extension across much of the southern Tibetan Plateau at this time.

Here, we reconstruct regional changes in precipitation source and seasonality and local changes in warm-season duration and rainstorm events related to the Pacific North American pattern (PNA) using a 2100-year-long multi-proxy lake-sediment record from the midcontinental US. Wet midcontinental climate reflecting negative PNA-like conditions occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (950-1250 CE) as Native American populations adopted intensive maize agriculture, facilitating population aggregation and the development of urban centers between 1000-1200 CE. Intensifying midcontinental socio-political instability and warfare between 1250-1350 CE corresponded with drier positive PNA-like conditions, culminating in the staggered abandonment of many major Native American river valley settlements and large urban centers between 1350-1450 CE during an especially severe warm-season drought. We hypothesize that this sustained drought interval rendered it difficult to support dense populations and large urban centers in the midcontinental US by destabilizing regional agricultural systems, thereby contributing to the host of socio-political factors that led to population reorganization and migration in the midcontinent and neighboring regions shortly before European contact.

The study aimed to identify the phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability of different Coleps isolates from various water bodies and from culture collections. We used an integrative approach to study the strains by (i) cultivation in a suitable culture medium, (ii) screening of the morphological variability including the presence/absence of algal endosymbionts of living cells by light microscopy, (iii) sequencing of the SSU and ITS rDNA including secondary structures, (iv) assessment of their seasonal and spatial occurrence in two lakes over a one-year cycle both from morphospecies counts and high-throughput sequencing (HTS), and, (v) proof of the co-occurrence of Coleps and their endosymbiotic algae from HTS-based network analyses in the two lakes. The Coleps strains showed a high phenotypic plasticity and low genetic variability. The algal endosymbiont in all studied strains was Micractinium conductrix and the mutualistic relationship turned out as facultative. Coleps is common in both lakes over the whole year in different depths and HTS has revealed that only one genotype respectively one species, C. viridis, was present in both lakes despite the different lifestyles (mixotrophic with green algal endosymbionts or heterotrophic without algae). Our results suggest a future revision of the species concept of the genus Coleps.					; Qu, Zhishuai/Y-5378-2018; Darienko, Tatyana/KXQ-8223-2024; Kammerlander, Barbara/GWZ-2136-2022	BRUNI, Estelle P./0000-0002-0800-0254; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; Qu, Zhishuai/0000-0002-2971-0570; Kammerlander, Barbara/0000-0002-6253-9031; Sonntag, Bettina/0000-0001-7065-522X; 													2045-2322					MAR 15	2021	11	1							5916	10.1038/s41598-021-84265-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84265-y								33723272					WOS:000630515700001

In this paper, we show how sensitive calculation of the latter is to the quality of data available and assumptions made during analysis. Based on the collection of a large new dataset, we quantify the sediment masses (1) mobilized on the hillslopes draining towards Lake Tana (Ethiopia), (2) stored in the floodplains, (3) transported into the lake, (4) deposited in the lake and (5) delivered out from the lake so as to establish a sediment budget. In 2012-2013, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discharge measurements were made at 13 monitoring stations, including two lake outlets. Altogether, 4635 SSC samples were collected and sediment rating curves that account for land cover conditions and rainfall seasonality were established for the 11 river stations, and mean monthly SSC was calculated for the outlets. Effects of the floodplain on rivers' sediment yield (SY) were investigated using measurements at both sides of the floodplains. SY from ungauged rivers was assessed using a model that includes catchment area and rainfall, whereas bedload and direct sediment input from lake shores were estimated. As a result, the gross annual SY was c. 39.55 (+/- 0.15) Mt, dominantly from Gilgel Abay and Gumara Rivers. The 2.57 (+/- 0.17) Mt sediment deposited in floodplains indicate that the floodplains serve as an important sediment sink. Moreover, annually c. 1.09 Mt of sediment leaves the lake through the two outlets. Annual sediment deposition in the lake was c. 36.97 (+/- 0.22) Mt and organic matter accumulation was 2.15 Mt, with a mean sediment trapping efficiency of 97%. Furthermore, SSC and SY are generally higher at the beginning of the rainy season because soils in cultivated fields are bare and loose due to frequent ploughing and seedbed preparation. Later in the season, increased crop and vegetation cover lead to a decrease in sediment production. Based on the established sediment budget with average rainfall, the lifetime of Lake Tana was estimated as 764 to 1032 years, which is shorter than what was anticipated in earlier studies. The sedimentation rate of Lake Tana (11.7 +/- 0.1kg m(-2)yr(-1)) is in line with the sedimentation rates of larger lakes in the world, like Lake Dongting and Lake Kivu.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Particulate organic matter (POM) plays an important role in biological pumping as a source of energy and nutrients in aquatic systems, as well as being the mechanism for algal bloom formation. However, research on its sources and composition, particularly the research on the contribution of algae in the bloom season, is still insufficient. In this study, the sources and composition of the POM in the surface water of Lake Taihu during the algal bloom season were quantitatively analysed. Dual stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes revealed that the algae were not the only sources of POM during algal blooms, and their contributions were inconsistent in the different lake regions. On average, algae made up 57.2% of the POM in Lake Taihu. Due to wind farms and nutrient runoff, algal POM was mainly concentrated in Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay and Central Taihu. The proportions of algal POM in the western estuary area and East Taihu were the smallest with a minimum of 10.8%. The proportion of terrestrial POM in the surface water and vertical sections was 18.3% and 40.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the highest value was 76.8%, which accounted for a large proportion in the algal bloom season. The terrestrial POM that came from rivers was mainly concentrated in the western part of Lake Taihu, while the resuspension of sediments also increased the proportion of terrestrial sources in the surface water. Affected by the distribution of the vegetation in Lake Taihu, the proportion of macrophyte POM in East Taihu was higher than that of algal sources. Although the contribution of endogenous POM might further increase due to the dual effects of climate change and eutrophication, our isotopic evidence suggested that terrestrial POM cannot be ignored, even in the algal bloom season.

J	Cantonati, M; Lowe, RL				Cantonati, Marco; Lowe, Rex L.			Lake benthic algae: toward an understanding of their ecology	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Lake phytoplankton studies outnumber studies on lake periphyton by an order of magnitude, and most periphyton research has been done in streams. Most benthic algal taxa found in lakes also can be found in lotic systems, but assemblages and taxa differ in a number of ways. The ecological characteristics of some lake benthic algae reflect habitat coupling. Littoral zones (benthic areas above the light compensation depth) are areas of high productivity and biodiversity. The proportion of benthic and planktonic primary production (autotrophic structure) is a key ecosystem property. The distribution of lake benthic algae is markedly influenced by the depth gradient and substratum, and assemblages change with depth from epilithic and epiphytic rheobionts to epipsammic and epipelic limnobionts. At shallow depths, periphyton must cope with the effects of high radiation, water-level fluctuations, wave action (e.g., desiccation, ultraviolet radiation exposure, shear stress), and seasonal shifts in temperature. This situation selects for widely distributed rheophilic species. In contrast, the deeper littoral zone is stable and hosts a distinct subset of lentic periphyton. However, species experience low light intensity, which becomes increasingly severe with increasing depth, and are often threatened by eutrophication-driven increased shading by phytoplankton. Besides change across depths and substrata, adaptations to disturbance levels, competition, microdistribution of phenological stages, and physiomorphological regulation generate multiple and complex spatial patterns at different scales. Lake shores are the focus of human activities with significant consequences for periphyton. In this review, we introduce a series of 15 papers on the topic and suggest directions for future research. Overall, this special series illustrates that, despite the many important ecosystem services provided by lake benthic algae, the topic is understudied.

In this paper, we present first results from the study of the lithic and bone artifacts unearthed at the Lower Palaeolithic site Marathousa 1 (MAR-1), Megalopolis, Greece. The context of the site represents a depositional environment close to a lakeshore, where rapid burial in a very fine-grained matrix ensured extraordinary conditions for preservation. Lithic artifacts occur in spatial and stratigraphic association with remains of the elephant Palaeoloxodon antiquus as well as other mammals. Bones, including those of elephants, show clear anthropogenic flaking scars, cut-marks and fracture patterns indicating deliberate breakage and modification by early humans. The MAR-1 lithic assemblage is composed of small-sized debitage, retouched tools, a few small and exhausted cores, as well as a large number of debris and retouch products, such as chips and resharpening flakes. Currently, there are no indications of Acheulean bifacial debitage, large cutting tools are missing, and a key aspect of the material refers to its 'microlithic' character. The scarcity of cores and primary flakes indicates a fragmented reduction sequence and complex discard patterns that require further investigation. On the basis of the on-going analysis of lithic material from three field seasons, we discuss aspects of assemblage composition and the role of raw material types, the main technological and typological traits of the industry, as well as the potential contribution of the MAR-1 assemblage in broader discussions about Middle Pleistocene lithic techno-complexes and subsistence strategies in Eurasia. Finally, we briefly present a small sample of bone artifacts, which suggest that hominin exploitation of the animal carcasses was not restricted to marrow extraction and bone processing for nutritional needs, but included also the knapping of bones, potentially with the aim of using the knapped products as tools. The MAR-1 archaeological record compares well with other important Eurasian sites yielding 'small tool assemblages', such as Ficoncella, La Polledrara, Bilzingsleben, Schoningen and Vertesszolos, some of which, like MAR-1, have provided evidence of elephant or other mega-fauna exploitation.					; Giusti, Domenico/AAB-5939-2020; Konidaris, George/F-3537-2017; Harvati, Katerina/A-5197-2008; Karkanas, Panagiotis/F-7762-2011	Giusti, Domenico/0000-0003-1438-4036; Tourloukis, Vangelis/0000-0002-9527-2708; Karkanas, Panagiotis/0000-0002-7156-671X													1040-6182	1873-4553				DEC 20	2018	497						47	64		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.05.043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.05.043													WOS:000452436500006

Harmful Algal Blooms lead to multi-billion-dollar losses in the United States due to shellfish closures, fish mortalities, and reluctance to consume seafood. Therefore, an improved early seasonal prediction of harmful algal blooms severity is important. Conventional methods for harmful algal blooms prediction using nutrient loading as the primary driver have been found to be less accurate during extreme bloom years. Here we show that a machine learning approach using observed nutrient loading, and large-scale climate indices can improve the harmful algal blooms prediction in Lake Erie. Moreover, the seasonal prediction of harmful algal blooms can be completed by early June, before the expected peak in harmful algal bloom activity from July to October. This improved early seasonal prediction can provide timely information to policymakers for adopting proper planning and mitigation strategies such as restrictions in harvesting and help in monitoring toxins in shellfish to keep contaminated products off the market.

The cyanobacteria bloom and microcystin (MC) pollution caused by anthropogenic eutrophication have attracted much attention due to their toxic effects. To provide an insight into the cyanobacterial problem in the ponds, the environmental parameters and MCs of a typical artificial pond in the Yangtze River Delta region of China were monitored and studied from May to December 2015. During the monitoring period, the ponds were in serious eutrophication with total phosphorus (TP) concentrations between 0.95 and 1.80 mu g/L, and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations between 1.1 and 4.86 mu g/L. High feed coefficient and high fish stock were the main reasons for the eutrophication. The results showed that the water temperature was the key factor that affected the cyanobacteria blooming in the pond. The chlorophyll a concentration was significantly positively correlated with the cyanobacteria density during the blooming season. MC-LR and MC-RR existed simultaneously and showed a significant positive correlation. The peak concentrations of dissolved MC-LR and MC-RR in the pond water were 40.6 and 4.7 mu g/L, respectively, which is considered highly toxic. Free MC-LR and MC-RR were also found in the aquaculture products. MC-LR concentrations in the bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) liver and shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) muscle were up to 2.64 and 4.17 mu g/kg, respectively. MC-RR concentration was up to 1.89 mu g/kg in the black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) liver. The results implied the potential health risks for citizens and pets caused by current artificial freshwater aquaculture pond systems.

Study of these as well as recently re-organized collections from Mary Leakey's 1972 HWK EE excavations here provides a synthetic view of the faunal community of Olduvai during Middle Bed II at similar to 1.7-1.4 Ma, an interval that captures the local transition from Oldowan to Acheulean technology. We expand the faunal list for this interval, name a new bovid species, clarify the evolution of several mammalian lineages, and record new local first and last appearances. Compositions of the fish and large mammal assemblages support previous indications for the dominance of open and seasonal grassland habitats at the margins of an alkaline lake. Fish diversity is low and dominated by cichlids, which indicates strongly saline conditions. The taphonomy of the fish assemblages supports reconstructions of fluctuating lake levels with mass die-offs in evaporating pools. The mammals are dominated by grazing bovids and equids. Habitats remained consistently dry and open throughout the entire Bed II sequence, with no major turnover or paleoecological changes taking place. Rather, wooded and wet habitats had already given way to drier and more open habitats by the top of Bed I, at 1.85-1.80 Ma. This ecological change is close to the age of the Oldowan-Acheulean transition in Kenya and Ethiopia, but precedes the local transition in Middle Bed II. The Middle Bed II large mammal community is much richer in species and includes a much larger number of large-bodied species (>300 kg) than the modern Serengeti. This reflects the severity of Pleistocene extinctions on African large mammals, with the loss of large species fitting a pattern typical of defaunation or 'downsizing' by human disturbance. However, trophic network (food web) analyses show that the Middle Bed II community was robust, and comparisons with the Serengeti community indicate that the fundamental structure of food webs remained intact despite Pleistocene extinctions. The presence of a generalized meateating hominin in the Middle Bed II community would have increased competition among carnivores and vulnerability among herbivores, but the high generality and interconnectedness of the Middle Bed II food web suggests this community was buffered against extinctions caused by trophic interactions.

When surface cooling occurs over a long enough period, the thermally induced cross-shore pressure gradient may drive an overturning circulation, a phenomenon called 'thermal siphon'. However, the conditions under which this process begins are not yet fully characterised. Here, we examine the development of thermal siphons driven by a uniform loss of heat at the air-water interface in sloping, stratified basins. For a two-dimensional framework, we derive theoretical time and velocity scales associated with the transition from Rayleigh-Benard type convection to a horizontal overturning circulation across the shallower sloping basin. This transition is characterised by a three-way horizontal momentum balance, in which the cross-shore pressure gradient balances the inertial terms before reaching a quasi-steady regime. We performed numerical and field experiments to test and show the robustness of the analytical scaling, describe the convective regimes and quantify the cross-shore transport induced by thermal siphons. Our results are relevant for understanding the nearshore fluid dynamics induced by nighttime or seasonal surface cooling in lakes and reservoirs.

It is stratified, and the water column has three distinct water masses: an upper freshwater-to-moderately saline stratum (0-3 m), an intermediate stratum exhibiting a steep halocline (3-3.5 m), and a lower hypersaline stratum (4 m and below) that is euxinic (i.e. anoxic and sulphidic). Recent studies have characterized the lake's microbial taxonomy and given rise to intriguing ecological questions. Here, we explore whether the communities are dynamic or stable in relation to taxonomic composition, geochemistry, biophysics, and ecophysiological functions during the annual cycle. We found: (i) seasonally fluctuating, light-dependent communities in the upper layer (>= 0.987-0.990 water-activity), a stable but phylogenetically diverse population of heterotrophs in the hypersaline stratum (water activities down to 0.762) and a persistent plate of green sulphur bacteria that connects these two (0.958-0.956 water activity) at 3-3.5 to 4 m; (ii) communities that might be involved in carbon- and sulphur-cycling between and within the lake's three main water masses; (iii) uncultured lineages including Acetothermia (OP1), Cloacimonetes (WWE1), Marinimicrobia (SAR406), Omnitrophicaeota (OP3), Parcubacteria (OD1) and other Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria, and SR1 in the hypersaline stratum (likely involved in the anaerobic steps of carbon- and sulphur-cycling); and (iv) that species richness and habitat stability are associated with high redox-potentials. Ursu Lake has a unique and complex ecology, at the same time exhibiting dynamic fluctuations and stability, and can be used as a modern analogue for ancient euxinic water bodies and comparator system for other stratified hypersaline systems.

J	Caissie, D				Caissie, D.			The thermal regime of rivers: a review	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems, including water quality issues and the distribution of aquatic species within the river environment. Consequently, for conducting environmental impact assessments as well as for effective fisheries management, it is important to understand the thermal behaviour of rivers and related heat exchange processes. 2. This study reviews the different river thermal processes responsible for water temperature variability on both the temporal (e.g. diel, daily, seasonal) and spatial scales, as well as providing information related to different water temperature models currently found in the literature. 3. Water temperature models are generally classified into three groups: regression, stochastic and deterministic models. Deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature, whereas regression and stochastic models generally rely on air to water temperature relationships. 4. Water temperature variability can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic perturbations, such as thermal pollution, deforestation, flow modification and climate change. Literature information is provided on the thermal regime of rivers in relation to anthropogenic impacts and such information will contribute to the better protection of fish habitat and more efficient fisheries management.																			0046-5070					AUG	2006	51	8					1389	1406		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01597.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01597.x													WOS:000239600400001

Using distance-based RDA and variance partitioning, we explored the different components of total beta diversity (replacement and richness difference) based on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic data of aquatic macrophytes along environmental and spatial gradients across 49 tropical floodplain lakes in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso in the dry season. We found that taxonomic beta diversity was driven by species replacement, while functional beta diversity was mostly contributed by richness difference and phylogenetic beta diversity was equally contributed by both components. Taxonomic and functional beta diversities were driven by environmental variables, connectivity variables, and directional spatial processes. Phylogenetic beta diversity was mainly affected by the connectivity between the sites and their distance from the river. The relationship between environmental variables and beta diversity indicates that a selection of species with similar functional and phylogenetic characteristics co-occurs at a site. The low connectivity between sites and the increased distance between the lakes and the river suggested dispersal limitation, which was due to the absence of directional exchange of species between lakes. Our findings provided new insights into the beta diversity patterns of aquatic macrophytes and their underlying causes in tropical floodplains.

However, because of the complex ecological environment of wetlands, the applicability of these data for studying temporal dynamics of wetland-related land-cover types is limited. This is especially so for the Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, which has active seasonal and inter-annual dynamics. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the suitability of MODIS 250-m maximum value composite (MVC) vegetation indexes (VIs) for dynamics monitoring of the Poyang Lake. We applied a time-series 16-day MODIS NDVI from 2000 to 2012 and developed a method to classify wetland cover types based on timing of inundation. We combined techniques of applying iterative self-organizing data analysis (ISODATA) with varying numbers of clusters and a transformed divergence (TD) statistic, to implement annual classification of smoothed time-series NDVI. In addition, we propose a decision tree based on features derived from NDVI profiles, to characterize phenological differences among clusters. Supported by randomly generated validation samples from TM images and daily water level records, we obtained a satisfactory accuracy assessment report. Classification results showed various change patterns for four dominant land cover types. Water area showed a non-significant declining trend with average annual change rate 33.25 km(2), indicating a drier Poyang lake, and emergent vegetation area had weak change over the past 13 years. Areas of submerged vegetation and mudflat expanded, with significant average annual change rate 23.51 km(2) for the former. The results suggest that MODIS' 250-m spatial resolution is appropriate and the classification method based on timing of inundation is useful for mapping general land cover patterns of Poyang Lake.

J	Dronova, I; Gong, P; Wang, L				Dronova, Iryna; Gong, Peng; Wang, Lin			Object-based analysis and change detection of major wetland cover types and their classification uncertainty during the low water period at Poyang Lake, China	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Productive wetland systems at land-water interfaces that provide unique ecosystem services are challenging to study because of water dynamics, complex surface cover and constrained field access. We applied object-based image analysis and supervised classification to four 32-m Beijing-1 microsatellite images to examine broad-scale surface cover composition and its change during November 2007-March 2008 low water season at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland system in China (>4000 km(2)). we proposed a novel method for semi-automated selection of training objects in this heterogeneous landscape using extreme values of spectral indices (SIs) estimated from satellite data. Dynamics of the major wetland cover types (Water, Mudflat, Vegetation and Sand) were investigated both as transitions among primary classes based on maximum membership value, and as changes in memberships to all classes even under no change in a primary class. Fuzzy classification accuracy was evaluated as match frequencies between classification outcome and a) the best reference candidate class (MAX function) and b) any acceptable reference class (RIGHT function). MAX-based accuracy was relatively high for Vegetation (>= 90%), Water (>= 82%), Mudflat (>= 76%) and the smallest-area Sand (>= 75%) in all scenes; these scores improved with the RIGHT function to 87-100%. Classification uncertainty assessed as the proportion of fuzzy object area within a class at a given fuzzy threshold value was the highest for all classes in November 2007, and consistently higher for Mudflat than for other classes in all scenes. Vegetation was the dominant class in all scenes, occupying 41.2-49.3% of the study area. Object memberships to Vegetation mostly declined from November 2007 to February 2008 and increased substantially only in February-March 2008, possibly reflecting growing season conditions and grazing. Spatial extent of Water both declined and increased during the study period, reflecting precipitation and hydrological events. The "fuzziest" Mudflat class was involved in major detected transitions among classes and declined in classification accuracy by March 2008, representing a key target for finer-scale research. Future work should introduce Vegetation sub-classes reflecting differences in phenology and alternative methods to discriminate Mudflat from other classes. Results can be used to guide field sampling and top-down landscape analyses in this wetland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Internally drained catchments dominate supraglacial hydrology of the southwest Greenland Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Internally drained catchments (IDCs) are hydrologic units on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface that collect and drain meltwater through supraglacial stream/river networks to terminal moulins or lakes. Their areas and shapes constrain the volumes and locations of supraglacial meltwater penetration into the ice. We map IDCs of the southwest GrIS by using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager panchromatic imagery and a moderate-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). In total 919 IDCs are mapped between 400m and 2000m above sea level, together with their associated supraglacial river networks (total length of 21,129 km), supraglacial lakes (436), and terminal moulins (872). A complex yet broadly predictable surface drainage pattern is revealed, with both IDC areas (AIDC, averaging 17.0 +/- 22.8 km(2), range of 0.4-244.9 km(2)) and the optimal DEM depression-filling threshold (A(dep), varying from 0.2 to 1.0 km(2)) generally increasing with ice surface elevation H. Historical air photos suggest possible transferability of the first relationship over space and time. Intersection of IDC boundaries with Modele Atmospherique Regional regional climate model runoff simulations shows > 50% of runoff modeled for elevations > 1600m is not transported downstream to lower elevations, but instead drains to a small number (51 out of 872) of terminal moulins, indicating modest but nontrivial penetration of surface meltwater at high elevations. In sum, IDCs provide a new, fine-scale hydrologic unit for study of GrIS surface hydrologic processes.

The Daliao River Watershed (DLRW) is severely disturbed by human activities in the LRB. In this study, three rivers within the DLRW-Xi River (XR), Hun River (HR), and Daliao River (DLR)-were selected as sampling locations. The distribution, partitioning, and risk assessment of four endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), e.g., bisphenol A (BPA), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), in the rivers were investigated. The results showed that the concentration of BPA was generally higher than those of the other three steroidal estrogens in the sampling locations. The estrogen levels in the XR were greater than those in the HR and DLR. As a result of a decreasing river flow rate during the frozen season and irregular wastewater discharge from human domestic activities and manufacture processing, the total concentration of selected EDCs in the frozen season was much greater than those in nonfrozen season with the highest concentration in surface water of the XR at 1131.0 ng/L for BPA, 1235.0 ng/L for E1, 1253.5 ng/L for E2, and 17,111.5 ng/L for EE2, respectively. Based on the field-measured BPA concentrations in the sediment and water, the organic carbon-normalized partition coefficient (K (oc)) of BPA were calculated with the values of 2884-45,031 L/kg; the concentration of BPA in sediment was positive correlated with the content of OC (R (2) = 0.932). The risk assessment made by estradiol equivalent (EEQ) and risk quotient (RQ) showed that 64.7% of sampling sites were exposed to high estrogenic activity (aEEQ > 1) and high risk in surface water, whereas the RQ values of all selected estrogens in sediment were in medium or minimal risk. Both EE2 and E1 were the major contributors to the total estrogenic activity and risk quotient in surface water.

Among 44 targeted antibiotics, 13 antibiotics were detected in more than 30% of sediment samples. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were the predominant antibiotics in these field samples, with average concentrations of up to 2074 and 1902 ng/g dry weight (dw), respectively, followed by macrolides (87.9 ng/g dw), lincosamides (8.06 ng/g dw) and sulfonamides (8.38 ng/g dw). High antibiotic contamination levels were almost always detected in black-odor sludges from economically less developed small cities; however, the difference in antibiotic concentrations between well-developed and small cities in China was not statistically significant. In addition, among the seven regions within China, no significant difference in concentrations was observed for the most antibiotics. Variances in antibiotic composition patterns in the 28 provinces of China may be due to differences in bacterial resistance, prescription habits, efficacy, and sediment carbon concentrations among various regions. There were significant positive correlations among some antibiotics in the same or different classes. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to investigate the change of Lake Victoria over the past decades, this paper presents an approach for the long time series analysis of water volume by using a combination of multi-mission altimetry and remotely sensed images. The proposed approach consists of three main components. (i) Estimation of the lake surface area variations from 2000 to 2012 by the use of support vector machine (SVM) for remotely sensed imagery. (ii) Calculation of the lake surface height from 1991 to 2012 by the use of multi-mission altimetry data through an elimination of the bias between different satellite missions. (iii) Development of the relationship between the area-water level above lowest level (WLALL) and water volume above lowest level (WVALL) by the use of regression and integration analysis to estimate the volume variations over the past 22 years. Several new findings discovered through the experimental results: (i) Lake surface area, height, and volume have experienced significant fluctuations over the past 22 years as follows: (a) the relatively stable period from 1991 to 1997; (b) the significant increase period from 1998 to 1999; (c) the sharp drop period from 2000 to 2006; and (d) the gradual increase period from 2007 to 2012. (ii) The intra-annual analysis indicates that lake surface area, height, and volume show obvious seasonal patterns. (iii) The significant changes of Lake Victoria, which are detected from remotely sensed imagery and satellite altimetry data, coincide with the events responsible for these variations, which are excessive outflow, weather conditions, rapid population growth and land-cover changes.

The bacterium Sphingomonas glacialis AAP5 isolated from the alpine lake Gossenkollesee contains genes for both systems. Here, we show that BChl is expressed between 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in the dark, whereas xanthorhodopsin is expressed only at temperatures below 16 degrees C and in the presence of light. Thus, cells grown at low temperatures under a natural light-dark cycle contain both BChl-based photosystems and xanthorhodopsins with a nostoxanthin antenna. Flash photolysis measurements proved that both systems are photochemically active. The captured light energy is used for ATP synthesis and stimulates growth. Thus, S. glacialis AAP5 represents a chlorophototrophic and a retinalophototrophic organism. Our analyses suggest that simple xanthorhodopsin may be preferred by the cells under higher light and low temperatures, whereas larger BChl-based photosystems may perform better at lower light intensities. This indicates that the use of two systems for light harvesting may represent an evolutionary adaptation to the specific environmental conditions found in alpine lakes and other analogous ecosystems, allowing bacteria to alternate their light-harvesting machinery in response to large seasonal changes of irradiance and temperature.					; Bellas, Christopher/C-6292-2015; Kaftan, David/N-6799-2019; Gardiner, Alastair T./KFB-7675-2024; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011; Tomasch, Jurgen/KEJ-5590-2024; Gardian, Zdenko/G-9476-2014; Kopejtka, Karel/GWU-5596-2022; Sommaruga, Ruben/P-6626-2019; Koblizek, Michal/H-2851-2014; Tomasch, Juergen/KEJ-5590-2024; Bina, David/G-9416-2014	Kopejtka, Karel/0000-0001-5412-4541; Kaftan, David/0000-0003-0932-0986; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461; Tomasch, Jurgen/0000-0002-3914-2781; Bellas, Christopher/0000-0001-5084-7830; Gardiner, Alastair T./0000-0001-6161-2914; Gardian, Zdenko/0000-0003-1578-2773; Koblizek, Michal/0000-0001-6938-2340													0027-8424	1091-6490				DEC 5	2022	119	50								10.1073/pnas.2211018119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2211018119								36469764					WOS:000944610300002
J	Vasistha, P; Ganguly, R				Vasistha, Prachi; Ganguly, Rajiv			Water quality assessment in two lakes of Panchkula, Haryana, using GIS: case study on seasonal and depth wise variations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Water is the most important commodity available on earth and exists as both surface and sub-surface sources, but increased water pollution has reduced its potability. In this context, it has become imperative to regularly monitor the water quality. In situ and laboratory experimental procedures involve point wise collection of samples for quality determination which are too elaborative and time consuming. As such, the use of methods like Geographic Information System (GIS) modelling if used in collaboration with the traditional methods can prove to be a great tool as they are less expensive and gives a complete spatial resolution of the study site. Therefore, the present study focuses on the determination of water quality using traditional methods in collaboration with GIS modelling system using the inverse distance weighing (IDW) method for two natural lakes in Haryana. The IDW technique was used to interpolate parameters like temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrates (NO3) and total phosphorous (TP) as they represent the effects of recent and old pollution in lake waters at different depths. These parameters were interpolated for determining the overall water quality status for the lakes. The collaboration can prove to be of great practical significance in today's time by giving an elaborative view of the present water quality status, easing daily telemetric monitoring of the sites as well as give an opportunity for futuristic modelling. The technique can work for almost all the sites around the globe which have either not been evaluated from quality aspect or are inaccessible for monitoring. Parameters like temperature and DO show significant depth wise and seasonal variations for both the lakes with highest values observed at the surface levels, whereas the NO3 and TP represented effects of point pollution sources to a smaller extent. The maximum value of temperature was determined to be of 30.7 degrees C and 9 mg/l for DO and was recorded at the surface of lakes 2 and 1, respectively. Further, nitrate and phosphorous concentrations were observed to have maximum values of 0.99 and 0.5 mg/l at the centre of the lake 1 for monsoon season due to influx of pollutants and settlements in the bed. The primary reason for the variation of water quality may be attributed to increased sedimentation at the bottom of lake due to agricultural activities in the vicinity which creates impacts on different hydrodynamic processes leading to increased levels of TP and NO3 concentrations. Further, increased recreational activities lead to induced variations in the water quality as well.

Modern constraints on the sources and climate signals recorded by sedimentary plant waxes in west Greenland	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The hydrogen isotopic composition (delta H-2 values) of plant waxes preserved in the sedimentary record is a useful proxy for past hydroclimate, but a number of known biological and environmental factors can confound the climate signal this proxy records. High-latitude ecology and environmental conditions differ from those of the better-studied low latitudes, and the influence of arctic conditions on factors that affect delta H-2 records of climate is poorly constrained. Direct observations of arctic plant waxes and their delta H-2 values, particularly from aquatic plants, are very limited. Here we present a study of n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid homologue distributions, delta H-2 values, and delta C-13 values from west Greenland, including measurements of terrestrial and aquatic plants, algae, and Nostoc (colonial cyanobacteria). By examining samples collected from the same region and season, we focus on climate-independent factors that may affect the delta H-2 values of sedimentary plant waxes. We observe that the average abundance of leaf n-alkyl lipids (C-20-C-31) in common terrestrial plants from this region exceeds that in aquatic sources by up to 30x. We also note weaker source specificity in n-alkanoic acids than in n-alkanes. A comparison of these data with surface sedimentary plant waxes from a lake within the study area, previously reported by McFarlin et al. (2019), indicates that at this site both mid-chain and long-chain sedimentary waxes are likely to derive from dominantly terrestrial sources, particularly biased towards the genus Salix. Abundance-weighted isotope data reveal that while terrestrial plants show taxonomic trends in delta H-2 values, the amplitude of these trends is unlikely to exceed the error of the proxy (the standard deviation on calculated epsilon(app)). n-Alkane epsilon(app) values are more variable in aquatic than in terrestrial sources, with median values ranging from -115 parts per thousand in n-C-31 to -143 parts per thousand in n-C-21. However, because sedimentary waxes at our study site are most similar to terrestrial plants for all homologues (in isotopic composition and proportional abundance), the large variability in aquatic epsilon(app) is unlikely to strongly impact sedimentary wax delta H-2 values here and in comparable environments. Our findings do not support using comparisons of mid- and long-chain homologues to infer differences between lake water and precipitation without independent validation of the source of mid-chain waxes. Nevertheless, we show that homologue abundance, delta H-2 values, and delta C-13 values of sedimentary n-alkanes can inform wax-based reconstructions of paleoclimate at high latitudes. This work provides new insights into the wax contributions from west Greenland plant communities and highlights important areas for future studies of arctic plants and plant wax proxies.

J	Wei, Q; Xue, LQ; Liao, SM; Yang, J; Niu, B				Wei, Qing; Xue, Lianqing; Liao, Shumin; Yang, Ju; Niu, Bin			Analysis of driving forces on ecohydrological regime and environmental flow changes in Hongze Lake, China	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Environmental flow refers to the fundamental hydrological process that sustains the ecosystem of rivers and lakes. Safeguarding environmental flow is crucial for optimal water resource utilization and lake ecosystem preservation. The study delivers a comprehensive exploration of ecohydrology, focusing on the common analysis of runoff and water level (RWL) to evaluate ecohydrological conditions in Hongze Lake (HZL) over five decades (1970-2020). Techniques such as the change point test and wavelet analysis were employed to discern trends and periodicity in hydrological elements. A series of ecologically pertinent indicators was applied to measure the changes in RWL, assessing their impacts on the lake's ecosystem. The Budyko hypothesis and cumulative slope rate of change (CSRC) were integrated for a quantitative analysis that shed light on the ecological response to RWL variations. Differential effects of human activities and climate change on runoff were discerned through subsurface parameter analysis across different decades. The study's results indicate that human activities, particularly gate dam operations and agricultural irrigation, have precipitated a significant reduction in envi-ronmental flow components (EFCs). The gate dam manipulation during the dry season has notably influenced the lake's hydrological regime, with a substantial alteration of RWL by 37% and 41%, respectively. This hydrological modification aligns with observed ecological trends such as species population reduction, habitat fragmentation, and organism miniaturization within HZL. Analysis of subsurface parameters also reflected an increasing in-fluence of climatic factors on runoff over time. Human activities, evapotranspiration, and precipitation were found to contribute 75.5%, 10.3%, and 14.2% to runoff alterations, and 70.1%, 11.4%, and 18.5% to water level (WL) changes, respectively.

The magnitude and impacts of climate variability and change differs spatially and temporally. This study examines the long term hydroclimatic changes, analyses of the hydroclimate variability and detect whether there exist significant trend or not in the Gidabo catchment, rift valley lakes basin of Ethiopia. Precipitation, temperature and stream flow time series data were used in monthly, seasonal and annual time scales. The precipitation and temperature data span is between 1982 and 2014 and that of stream flow is between 1976 and 2006. To detect trends the analysis were done by using Mann Kendal (MK), Sen's graphical method and to detect change point using the Pettit test. The comparison of trend analysis between MK trend test and Sen graphical method results depict mostly similar pattern. The annual rainfall trends exhibited a significant decrease by about 12 mm per year in the upstream, which is largely driven by the significant decrease in the peak season rainfall. The Pettit test revealed that the years 1997 and 2007 were the change points. It is noted that the rise of temperature over a catchment might have decreased the availability of soil moisture which resulted in less runoff. The temperature analyses also revealed that the catchment was getting warmer; particularly in the upstream. The minimum temperature trend showed a significant increase about 0.08 degrees c per annum. There is generally a decreasing trend in stream flow. The monthly stream flow also exhibited a decreasing trend in February, March and September. The decline in annual and seasonal rainfall and the increase in temperature lead to more evaporation and directly affecting the stream flow negatively. This trend compounded with the growth of population and increasing demand for irrigation water exacerbates the competing demand for water resources. It thus calls for prudence in devising appropriate intervention in the planning and sustainable development of the basin water resources.					; Belihu, Mamuye/AAP-7434-2021; Bewket, Woldeamlak/MTG-0133-2025; Getahun, Brook/HDL-9204-2022	Bewket, Woldeamlak/0000-0003-4445-1607; Mamuye Belihu, Zeleke/0000-0002-7238-8011; 													1474-7065	1873-5193				APR	2018	104						84	101		10.1016/j.pce.2017.10.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2017.10.002													WOS:000432487400011
J	Wang, JX; Chai, JS; Xu, RC; Pang, Y				Wang, Jingxian; Chai, Jisen; Xu, Ruichen; Pang, Yong			The effects of wind-wave disturbances on sediment resuspension and phosphate release in Lake Chao	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As a typical shallow lake with a wind-generated flow, the resuspension state of sediment and phosphorus release under wind field disturbance plays an important role in controlling lake eutrophication in Lake Chao. In this study, we proposed a combination of experimental analysis of dynamic disturbances, wind-wave disturbance shear stress calculation, and model simulation (experimental-calculative-modeling) to quantitatively investigate the effects of wind-wave disturbances on the resuspension state of Lake Chao bottom sediment and phosphorus release and distribution. The results showed that the release rate of phosphorus from the Lake Chao bottom sediment was affected by the wind field and bottom sediment content, which varied significantly spatially and showed some difference between different seasons. Under the condition of sufficient water body disturbance, the substrate in the Western Lake area of Lake Chao mainly adsorbed phosphate from the water body, while the substrate in the Central Lake area and the Eastern Lake area adsorbed phosphate along with the release. The magnitude of the phosphorus release rate due to sediment resuspension was mainly affected by wind speed, and the distribution of phosphorus content was influenced by the circulation generated by different dominant wind directions. The wind-wave disturbances have a significant effect on the spatial and temporal distribution of phosphorus in Lake Chao, and the proposed experimental-calculative-modeling ensemble can provide relevant technical support for the study of water pollution control strategies and comprehensive remediation and management of Lake Chao.

J	Kluska, M; Jablonska, J				Kluska, Mariusz; Jablonska, Joanna			Variability and Heavy Metal Pollution Levels in Water and Bottom Sediments of the Liwiec and Muchawka Rivers (Poland)	WATER												In recent years, human impact on the Earth's ecological environment has become increasingly visible, with serious negative consequences. One of the most important pollutants are heavy metals which can easily bind to sediments. Due to their toxic behavior, persistence, lack of biodegradability and bioaccumulation, they are considered key river pollutants that need to be controlled. This study examined two rivers: the Liwiec and Muchawka rivers located in south-eastern Poland. The mouth of the Liwiec River is the Bug River, which is partly the border between Poland and Belarus. In turn, the mouth of the Muchawka River is the Liwiec River. The objectives of the study were the following: (1) To complete a qualitative analysis of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni, Zn) in the waters and bottom sediments of the Liwiec and Muchawka rivers; (2) To assess the degree of heavy metal contamination; (3) To identify the sources of contamination. The analysis included samples of surface water and bottom sediments collected (16 water and 16 bottom sediment samples were taken from the Muchawka River and 32 water and 32 bottom sediment samples were taken from the Liwiec River) in June and September 2022. The variability of characteristics, such as temperature, precipitation and humidity, contributes to seasonal changes in the distribution characteristics and sources of heavy metals. The study showed that only a small part of the heavy metals entering rivers are present in the water depth in the dissolved state, and most of them enrich the sediment, resulting in much higher concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment than in the water column. The differences in the distribution of some elements in water and sediment are due to the fact that surface sediments retain long-term records. Therefore, sediment can be considered a potential source of heavy metals in the aquatic environment. In general, the content of heavy metals determined in bottom sediments was not high but indicative of anthropogenic human activity. There is a possibility of re-release of heavy metals from the sediment into the water when hydrodynamic conditions or environmental factors (pH, redox potential, etc.) change, which could lead to secondary water pollution. The data obtained will be of great importance to both researchers studying river systems and the population living in the area.

It is vital to understand the effects of water level fluctuations on bacterial communities and metabolic characteristics in freshwater lakes in a changing world. However, information on the microbial community structure and functional properties in permanently and seasonally flooded areas are lacking. Poyang Lake is a typical seasonal lake linked to the Yangtze River and is significantly affected by water level fluctuations. Bottom water was collected from 12 sampling sites: seven inundated for the whole year (inundated areas) and five drained during the dry season (emerged areas). High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to identify the bacterial communities. The results showed that the taxonomic structure and potential functions of the bacterial communities were significantly different between the inundated and emerged areas. Cyanobacteria was dominant in both areas, but the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria was much higher in the emerged areas than in the inundated areas. Bacterial communities were taxonomically sensitive in the inundated areas and functionally sensitive in the emerged areas. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations and their ratios, as well as dissolved oxygen, played important roles in promoting the bacterial taxonomic and functional compositional patterns in both areas. According to the metabolic predictions based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, the relative abundance of functional genes related to assimilatory nitrate reduction in the emerged areas was higher than in the inundated areas, and the relative abundance of functional genes related to dissimilatory nitrate reduction in the inundated areas was higher. These differences might have been caused by the nitrogen differences between the permanently and seasonally flooded areas caused by intra-annual water level fluctuations. The relative abundance of functional genes associated with denitrification was not significantly different in the inundated and emerged areas. This study improved our knowledge of bacterial community structure and nitrogen metabolic processes in permanently and seasonally flooded areas caused by water level fluctuations in a seasonal lake.

Isotopic constraints on water source mixing, network leakage and contamination in an urban groundwater system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water supply in developing countries is prone to large water losses due to leaky distribution networks and defective sewers, which may affect groundwater quality and quantity in urban areas and result in complex subsurface mixing dynamics. In this study, a multi-stable isotope approach was used to investigate spatiotemporal fluctuations of surface and sub-surface water source partitioning and mixing, and to assess nitrogen (N) contamination in the urban water cycle of As-Salt, Jordan. Water import from the King Abdullah Canal (KAC), mains waters from the network, and wastewater are characterized by distinct isotopic signatures, which allowed us to quantify city effluents into the groundwater. Temporal variations in isotopic signatures of polluted groundwater are explained by seasonally fluctuating inflow, and dilution by water that originates from Lake Tiberias and enters the urban water cycle via the MAC. Isotopic analysis (N and 0) and comparison between groundwater nitrate and nitrate from mains water, water imports and wastewater confirmed that septic waste from leaky sewers is the main contributor of nitrate contamination. The nitrate of strongly contaminated groundwater was characterized by highest delta N-15(N03) values (13.3 +/- 1.8%.), whereas lowest delta N-15(N03) values were measured in unpolluted groundwater (6.9%.). Analogously, nitrate concentration and isotopic ratios were used for source partitioning and qualitatively confirmed 8D(H20) and delta O-18(H2O)-based estimates. Dual water isotope endmember mixing calculations suggest that city effluents from leaky networks and sewers contribute 30-64% to the heavily polluted groundwater. Ternary mixing calculations including also chloride revealed that 5-18% of the polluted groundwater is wastewater. Up to two thirds of the groundwater originates from mains, indicating excessive water loss from the network, and calling for improved water supply management. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using weather radar to help minimize wind energy impacts on nocturnally migrating birds	CONSERVATION LETTERS												As wind energy rapidly expands worldwide, information to minimize impacts of this development on biodiversity is urgently needed. Here we demonstrate how data collected by weather radar networks can inform placement and operation of wind facilities to reduce collisions and minimize habitat-related impacts on nocturnally migrating birds. We found over a third of nocturnal migrants flew through altitudes within the rotor-swept zone surrounding the North American Great Lakes, a continentally important migration corridor. Migrating birds concentrated in terrestrial stopover habitats within 20-km from shorelines, a distance well beyond the current guidelines for construction of new land-based facilities, and their distributions varied seasonally and at local and regional scales, creating predictable opportunities to minimize impacts from wind energy development and operation. Networked radar data are available across the United States and other countries and broad application of this approach could provide information critical to bird-friendly expansion of this globally important energy source.					; Cohen, Emily/AAB-4246-2020; Buler, Jeffrey/H-3207-2019; Loss, Scott/B-1504-2014; Cabrera-Cruz, Sergio A./E-6424-2011	Buler, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2696-847X; Cohen, Emily/0000-0002-4978-4278; Loss, Scott/0000-0002-8753-2995; Cabrera-Cruz, Sergio A./0000-0001-8742-4719; Smolinsky, Jaclyn/0000-0002-4733-5313													1755-263X					JUL	2022	15	4							e12887	10.1111/conl.12887	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.12887		MAY 2022											WOS:000789646100001

Moreover, they can help to understand both how climate change and how land use and land cover changes impact the sediment exchange between the Amazon River and floodplain lakes in this important and complex ecosystem. This study investigates the suitability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 spectral characteristics in retrieving total (TSS) and inorganic (TSI) suspended sediments on a set of Amazon floodplain lakes in the middle-lower Amazon basin using in situ Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs) measurements to simulate Landsat 8/OLI (Operational Land Imager) and Sentinel 2/MSI (Multispectral Instrument) bands and to calibrate/validate several TSS and TSI empirical algorithms. The calibration was based on the Monte Carlo Simulation carried out for the following datasets: (1) All-Dataset, consisting of all the data acquired during four field campaigns at five lakes spread over the lower Amazon floodplain (n = 94); (2) Campaign-Dataset including samples acquired in a specific hydrograph phase (season) in all lakes. As sample size varied from one season to the other, n varied from 18 to 31; (3) Lake-Dataset including samples acquired in all seasons at a given lake with n also varying from 17 to 67 for each lake. The calibrated models were, then, applied to OLI and MSI scenes acquired in August 2017. The performance of three atmospheric correction algorithms was also assessed for both OLI (6S, ACOLITE, and L8SR) and MSI (6S, ACOLITE, and Sen2Cor) images. The impact of glint correction on atmosphere-corrected image performance was assessed against in situ glint-corrected R-rs measurements. After glint correction, the L8SR and 6S atmospheric correction performed better with the OLI and MSI sensors, respectively (Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 16.68% and 14.38%) considering the entire set of bands. However, for a given single band, different methods have different performances. The validated TSI and TSS satellite estimates showed that both in situ TSI and TSS algorithms provided reliable estimates, having the best results for the green OLI band (561 nm) and MSI red-edge band (705 nm) (MAPE < 21%). Moreover, the findings indicate that the OLI and MSI models provided similar errors, which support the use of both sensors as a virtual constellation for the TSS and TSI estimate over an Amazon floodplain. These results demonstrate the applicability of the calibration/validation techniques developed for the empirical modeling of suspended sediments in lower Amazon floodplain lakes using medium-resolution sensors.					; Barbosa, claudio/AAJ-4813-2020; Novo, Evlyn/M-6883-2016; Faria Barbosa, Claudio Clemente/M-4793-2014; Novo, Evlyn/AIB-5424-2022; Carvalho, Leonardo/K-7174-2013; Andrade, Daniel/ABA-6273-2020; de Lucia Lobo, Felipe/F-3270-2018	Maciel, Daniel/0000-0003-4543-5908; Novo, Evlyn/0000-0002-1223-9276; Faria Barbosa, Claudio Clemente/0000-0002-3221-9774; de Lucia Lobo, Felipe/0000-0001-8061-0076; Sander de Carvalho, Lino Augusto/0000-0001-8839-5366														2072-4292				AUG	2019	11	15							1744	10.3390/rs11151744	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11151744													WOS:000482442800008

In the present study, the reproductive migration of a threatened endemic fish, three-lips (Opsariichthys uncirostris uncirostris), was non-invasively monitored by quantitative PCR of species-specific environmental DNA (eDNA), the usefulness of which has been not sufficiently explored. Water sampling and from-shore visual inspection were performed weekly along a tributary of Lake Biwa (Japan), where adult fish seasonally migrate upstream to reproduce as well as at lake sites near the river mouth. Species-specific eDNA was collected at all locations at times when the fish were visually observed and at certain sites where the fish were not observed. Log-transformed individual counts from visual inspection were positively correlated with log-transformed eDNA concentration in the river sites, indicating that eDNA analysis can be a reliable quantitative tool for fish abundance in rivers. Furthermore, distance from the lake did not influence eDNA concentration, suggesting that eDNA transport by river flow had a negligible effect on eDNA quantification. Both eDNA concentration and individual counts gradually increased from May-July, and decreased in August. Importantly, eDNA analysis showed that the fish occupied more habitats in the peak reproductive season and stayed for longer time at any given site. An additional underwater survey confirmed unexpected eDNA detections as true positives. eDNA analysis has great potential to quantitatively monitor reproductive fish migrations under certain conditions.

Epidemiology of cholera outbreaks and socio-economic characteristics of the communities in the fishing villages of Uganda: 2011-2015	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												Background The communities in fishing villages in the Great Lakes Region of Africa and particularly in Uganda experience recurrent cholera outbreaks that lead to considerable mortality and morbidity. We evaluated cholera epidemiology and population characteristics in the fishing villages of Uganda to better target prevention and control interventions of cholera and contribute to its elimination from those communities. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a prospective study between 2011-15 in fishing villages in Uganda. We collected, reviewed and documented epidemiological and socioeconomic data for 10 cholera outbreaks that occurred in fishing communities located along the African Great Lakes and River Nile in Uganda. These outbreaks caused 1,827 suspected cholera cases and 43 deaths, with a Case-Fatality Ratio (CFR) of 2.4%. Though the communities in the fishing villages make up only 5-10% of the Ugandan population, they bear the biggest burden of cholera contributing 58% and 55% of all reported cases and deaths in Uganda during the study period. The CFR was significantly higher among males than females (3.2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.02). The outbreaks were seasonal with most cases occurring during the months of April-May. Male children under age of 5 years, and 5-9 years had increased risk. Cholera was endemic in some villages with well-defined "hotspots". Practices predisposing communities to cholera outbreaks included: the use of contaminated lake water, poor sanitation and hygiene. Additional factors were: ignorance, illiteracy, and poverty. Conclusions/Significance Cholera outbreaks were a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the fishing communities in Uganda. In addition to improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene, oral cholera vaccines could play an important role in the prevention and control of these outbreaks, particularly when targeted to high-risk areas and populations. Promotion and facilitation of access to social services including education and reduction in poverty should contribute to cholera prevention, control and elimination in these communities.

J	Rahi-Tamm, A; Kuusik, A				Rahi-Tamm, Aigi; Kuusik, Argo			Back to the ancestral homeland: the evacuation of Estonians from Northwestern Russia in 1942-44	AJALOOLINE AJAKIRI-THE ESTONIAN HISTORICAL JOURNAL												For Estonians, similarly to many other peoples, the German occupation (1941-44) stood for massive relocations of people that stemmed from the ethno-political aims and military needs of the National Socialist regime. The evacuation to Estonia in 1942- 44 of Estonians who lived in areas to the east of the Estonian border - in Ingria, the region beyond Lake Peipus (the former county of Oudova), and the Luga River and Pskov area - is the focus of this article. This was an operation to bring ethnic Estonians who had emigrated to Russia before World War I back to their ancestral homeland. According to the plan of the head of the German SS and Police Heinrich Himmler, the approximately 80,000 Russians who lived along Estonia's eastern border were to be settled to the east as an element foreign to Estonia both racially and in terms of their mentality and to replace them with the Estonians living on the eastern side of Lake Peipus. To this end, the Germans, Estonians, Baltic Finns and minorities of other origins living in Russia had to be registered first so that they could be resettled in Germany, Estonia, Finland or elsewhere. The registration of ethnic groups that began in October 1941 was completed in Ingria in February 1942. More than 81,000 persons were registered, among them over 12,000 Estonians. Registration continued in the Oudova area and elsewhere in 1942-43. The "yellow card" issued to registered persons permitted them to resettle. The evacuation of Germans began in January 1942. A while later, Estonians also received permission to relocate into Estonia via Narva. This initially took place on a voluntary basis and by the means of the people themselves. The organised extraction of Estonians began in the summer of 1942, while the more massive resettlement took place in 1943. Above all, difficult local conditions, especially hunger, frequent attacks by partisans, and the high-handed behaviour of the German authorities, forced the inhabitants to leave. Yet since there was a great deal of uncertainty concerning what lay ahead, many people were hesitated to leave. The situation changed in 1943, especially in the latter half of the year, when an offensive of Soviet forces was expected in the Leningrad area. On 21 September 1943, the supreme commander of the rear area of Army Group Nord Kuno-Hans von Both gave the order to implement Operation Roboter. According to this plan, not a single "person who could be put to use" was permitted to be left behind. Four routes were prescribed for the evacuation. A large number of people were brought across Lake Peipus on barges. The forcible evacuation of minorities that began in September was followed by the evacuation of local Russian inhabitants in October, which was carried out violently and at an accelerated pace, causing the inhabitants to flee to the woods en masse. Approximately 30,000 Russians were brought to Estonia in the course of this operation. Approximately 24,000 Estonians made it to Estonia in 1942-44. Most of them were put to work in agriculture. While the first Estonian resettlers were permitted to bring as much livestock, grain and property along with them as their means of transportation allowed, those who came later had to settle for bringing a few pieces of hand baggage. There was not enough food or places to live in Estonia. Those evacuees whose relatives invited them to stay with them were in a better situation. Most evacuees who had not found any relatives were housed in camps, from where they moved around chaotically looking for work and shelter, thus arousing fear in the local inhabitants of the spread of contagious diseases and annoyance due to the begging that ensued. Although farmers desperately needed a helping hand, the refugees often proved to be unreliable. After the Great Terror of the 1930s, in the course of which Estonians in the Soviet Union were murdered on the basis of their ethnic attributes, many regretted that they had not opted to return to Estonia in the 1920s. The dream of passage to Estonia came true in 1942-44 in a rather unexpected way, yet a number of disappointments were in store. The general attitude of Estonians living in Estonia was standoffish towards them as people who had come from "over there", or the land of the Soviets. Contacts between families had been severed in the 1920s and 1930s. Attitudes, prejudices, fears and the years spent apart generated distrust and estrangement, which in some cases persisted for years. The evacuation of Estonians also meant the final collapse of the Estonian villages and the cultural landscape in Northwestern Russia. About ten thousand Estonians still lived in the oblasts of Northwestern Russia in 1989.

Daily near-infrared (NIR) spectra from the AVHRR sensor with 1.1 km spatial resolution and 8-day NIR composites from the MODIS sensor with 250 m spatial resolution for the months April, July and September were used as input data. The methodological approach uses temporal dynamic thresholds for individual data sets, which allows detection of water pixel independent from differing conditions or sensor differences. The individual results are summed up and combined to monthly composites of areal extent of water bodies. The presented water masks for the months April, July, and September were chosen to detect seasonal patterns as well as inter-annual dynamics and show diverse behaviour of static, decreasing, or dynamic water bodies in the study region. The size of the Southern Aral Sea, as the most popular example for an ecologic catastrophe, is decreasing significantly throughout all seasons (R-2 0.96 for April; 0.97 for July; 0.96 for September). Same is true for shallow natural lakes in the northern Kazakhstan, exemplary the Tengiz-Korgalzhyn lake system, which have been shrinking in the last two decades due to drier conditions (R-2 0.91 for July; 0.90 for September). On the contrary, water reservoirs show high seasonality and are very dynamic within one year in their areal extent with maximum before growing season and minimum after growing season. Furthermore, there are water bodies such as Alakol-Sasykol lake system and natural mountainous lakes which have been stable in their areal extent throughout the entire time period. Validation was performed based on several Landsat images with 30 m resolution and reveals an overall accuracy of 83% for AVHRR and 91% for MODIS monthly water masks. The results should assist for climatological and ecological studies, land and water management, and as input data for different modelling applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Radiometric validation of atmospheric correction for MERIS in the Baltic Sea based on continuous observations from ships and AERONET-OC	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea that is optically dominated by coloured dissolved organic material (CDOM) and has relatively low sun elevation which makes accurate ocean colour remote sensing challenging in these waters. The high absorption, low scattering properties of the Baltic Sea are representative of other optically similar water bodies including the Arctic Ocean, Black Sea, coastal regions adjacent to the CDOM-rich estuaries such as the Amazon, and highly absorbing lakes where radiometric validation is essential in order to develop accurate remote sensing algorithms. Previous studies in this region mainly focused on the validation and improvement of standard Chlorophyll-a (Chl alpha) and attenuation coefficient (k(d)) ocean colour products. The primary input to derive these is the water-leaving radiance (L-w) or remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and it is therefore fundamental to obtain the most accurate L-w or R-rs before deriving higher level products. To this end, the retrieval accuracy of R-rs from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery using six atmospheric correction processors was assessed through above-water measurements at two sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network for Ocean Colour (AERONET-OC; 363 measurements) and a shipbome autonomous platform from which the highest number of measurements were obtained (4986 measurements). The six processors tested were the CoastColour processor (CC), the Case 2 Regional processor for lakes (C2R-Lakes), the Case 2 Regional CoastColour processor (C2R-CC), the FUB/WeW water processor (FUB), the MERIS ground segment processor (MEGS) and POLYMER. All processors except for CC had small average absolute percentage differences (psi) in the wavelength range from 490 nm to 709 nm (psi < 40%), while other bands had larger differences with psi > 60%. Compared to in situ values, the R-rs(709)/R-rs(665) band ratio had psi < 30% for all processors. The most accurate R-rs in the 490 to 709 nm domain was obtained from POLYMER with psi < 30% and coefficients of determination (R-2) > 0.6. Using a score system based on all statistical tests, POLYMER scored highest, while C2R-CC, C2R-Lakes and FUB had lower scores. This study represents the largest data base of in situ R-rs the most comprehensive analysis of AC models for highly absorbing waters and for MERIS, conducted to date. The results have implications for the new generation of Copernicus Sentinel ocean colour satellites.					; Simis, Stefan/B-1703-2008	Simis, Stefan/0000-0002-6296-9146; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2017	200						263	280		10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.024													WOS:000412607600019

However, there is still a lack of understanding of the degree of microplastic pollution in the sediment of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which has affected the estimation of microplastic flux into the sea. In this study, microplastics in sediments from 55 stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were investigated, including 48 mainstream stations, 5 confluence stations, and 2 lake stations. Microplastics were detected in 34 stations, ranging from 0 to 71.04 n/kg of dry weight. The average concentrations of microplastics in the mainstream, confluence and lake were 6.16 +/- 8.87, 23.91 +/- 11.2, and 43.95 +/- 27.09n/kg of dry weight, respectively. Of all the microplastics found in this investigation, fiber (59.52 %) forms the main type in terms of shape; PET is the most abundant microplastic species, accounting for 51.19 %. Sewage treatment plants are the most likely source of microplastics in sediment, and sediment from tributary estuaries, lake mouths, and lakes is an important sink of microplastics. Terrain, sediment transport load, biofilm, and flow velocity are important factors affecting microplastic settlement. Although there are multiple microplastic enrichment areas, the high flow velocity during the flood season makes it difficult for microplastics to remain in the sediment of the Yangtze River bed. This indicates that microplastics in riverbed sediments have little influence on the flux into the sea during flood season. This study is the first large-scale investigation of microplastics in riverbed sediments in the Yangtze river basin.(c) 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacteria blooms are a major environmental issue worldwide. Our understanding of the biophysical processes driving cyanobacterial proliferation and the ability to develop predictive models that inform resource managers and policy makers rely upon the accurate characterization of bloom dynamics. Models quantifying relationships between bloom severity and environmental drivers are often calibrated to an individual set of bloom observations, and few studies have assessed whether differences among observing platforms could lead to contrasting results in terms of relevant bloom predictors and their estimated influence on bloom severity. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of coherence of different monitoring methods in (1) capturing short-and long-term cyanobacteria bloom dynamics and (2) identifying environmental drivers associated with bloom variability. Using western Lake Erie as a case study, we applied boosted regression tree (BRT) models to long-term time series of cyanobacteria bloom estimates from multiple in-situ and remote sensing approaches to quantify the relative influence of physico-chemical and meteorological drivers on bloom variability. Results of BRT models showed remarkable consistency with known ecological requirements of cyanobacteria (e.g., nutrient loading, water temperature, and tributary discharge). However, discrepancies in inter-annual and intra-seasonal bloom dynamics across monitoring approaches led to some inconsistencies in the relative importance, shape, and sign of the modeled relationships between select environmental drivers and bloom severity. This was especially true for variables characterized by high short-term variability, such as wind forcing. These discrepancies might have implications for our understanding of the role of different environmental drivers in regulating bloom dynamics, and subsequently for the development of models capable of informing management and decision making. Our results highlight the need to develop methods to integrate multiple data sources to better characterize bloom spatio-temporal variability and improve our ability to understand and predict cyanobacteria blooms.

The mapped area included the coastline to 10 km inland to capture the region hydrologically connected to the Great Lakes. Maps were developed in cooperation with the overarching Great Lakes Consortium plan to provide a comprehensive regional baseline map suitable for coastal wetland assessment and management by agencies at the local, tribal, state, and federal levels. The goal was to provide not only land use and land cover (LULC) baseline data at moderate spatial resolution (20-30 m), but a repeatable methodology to monitor change into the future. The prime focus was on mapping wetland ecosystem types, such as emergent wetland and forested wetland, as well as to delineate wetland monocultures (Typha, Phragmites, Schoenoplectus) and differentiate peatlands (fens and bogs) from other wetland types. The overall accuracy for the coastal Great Lakes map of all five lake basins was 94%, with a range of 86% to 96% by individual lake basin (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior).

Results showed that water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), and electrical conductivity (EC) were within WHO standards for surface waters, except pH for some stations on KW and NG rivers, where it was highly alkaline. However, PO43-, NH4+, NO2- and NO3- concentrations increased gradually from upstream to downstream and were very high compared to the WHO standards, which means the river waters were heavily polluted. The highest nutrients concentrations were recorded in the dry season for all rivers, except KW and NG rivers at the midstream and downstream stations. The nutrient average fluxes collected at low-frequency (FLF) and high-frequency (FHF) downstream of each river were 95% correlated. Flux variations regarding PO43-, NH4+, NO2- and NO3- were significant for all rivers except PO43- in the NG river. The number of nutrients exported to Lake Kivu was estimated to average 0.6 t km(-2) of PO43-, 2.4 t km(-2) of NH4+, 1.0 t km(-2) of NO2- and 41.0 t km(-2) of NO3- per year. Given the current deterioration status of water quality in Bukavu urban rivers, there is an urgent need to improve liquid and solid waste management strategy in the area, to set up efficient wastewater treatment plants and sewage systems in various catchments to mitigate cumulative pollution of the rivers and the lake.

Study focus: Thermal stratification is an important factor shaping aquatic ecosystems in karst hydropower reservoirs. However, the underlying mechanism of thermal stratification formation is still unclear. Therefore, water temperature and related environmental factors were investigated to understand how reservoir hydraulic load (i.e., the ratio of the mean water depth to water retention time) affects thermal stratification in eight karst hydropower reservoirs on the Wujiang River. New hydrological insights for the region: The reservoir surface water had a higher temperature than the inflowing and released waters. The variation in the reservoir thermal stratification showed an obvious seasonal pattern, but the extents of the thermal stratification were different among the reservoirs. The rate of water temperature change is proposed to characterize reservoir thermal stratification and is significantly negatively correlated with reservoir hydraulic load, suggesting the control of both water depth and retention time on thermal stratification. This empirical relationship will be helpful in quantitatively evaluating the hydrological effect on thermal stratification, which further affects basic environmental parameters (including pH, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a) in narrow and deep karst cascade hydropower reservoirs.

An understanding of the distribution and dynamics of PAHs in lakes is required to restore the functions of lake ecosystems and to ensure the ecological security of urban water sources. The Quantitative Water Air Sediment Interaction (QWASI) model and partition coefficient and fugacity fraction methods were applied to estimate the multimedia transfers of PAHs in Dianshan Lake, a typical shallow lake in Shanghai, China. In addition, some new concepts and methods related to PAH transfers were introduced. The results showed that while the gas-solid partition in the area remained in non-equilibrium, the influence of pollution sources tended to weaken. Atmospheric advection was the main source of PAHs to the lake, and a portion of the net loss of advection was transformed into total flux of cross-interface transfers, in which transport fluxes from air to water and from water to sediment were dominant, with a significant correlation between the two types of transfer. The large resuspension of high molecular weight (HMW)-PAHs occurred, possibly related to frequent hydrodynamic disturbances. Furthermore, this study explored the distribution of PAHs among different compartments and the seasonal variation of multimedia transfers. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model is remarkably sensitive to four parameters including temperature and advection. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis verified that the simulation results were stable and reliable.The results can provide a theoretical basis for the monitoring and control of shallow lake pollution.

Three millennia of heavy rainfalls in Western Mediterranean: frequency, seasonality and atmospheric drivers	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Documenting subdecadal-scale heavy rainfall (HR) variability over several millennia can rarely be accomplished due to the paucity of high resolution, homogeneous and continuous proxy records. Here, using a unique, seasonally resolved lake record from southern Europe, we quantify temporal changes in extreme HR events for the last 2,800 years in this region and their correlation with negative phases of the Mediterranean Oscillation (MO). Notably, scarce HR dominated by a persistent positive MO mode characterizes the so-called Migration period (CE 370-670). Large hydroclimatic variability, particularly between CE 1012 and 1164, singles out the Medieval Climatic Anomaly, whereas more stationary HR conditions occurred between CE 1537 and 1805 coinciding with the Little Ice Age. This exceptional paleohydrological record highlights that the present-day trend towards strengthened hydrological deficit and less HR in the western Mediterranean is neither acute nor unusual in the context of Late Holocene hydrometeorological variability at centennial to decadal time scales.

To determine the optimal submerged macrophyte coverage required to improve water quality, field investigations and a simulation experiment were carried out in a sub-lake of Baiyangdian Lake, China. The effects of two seasons and five submerged macrophyte coverage gradients (0 [C-0], 25 [C-25], 50 [C-50], 75 [C-75], and 90% [C-90]) were examined in the field study, while the five submerged macrophyte coverage gradients were examined in an 80 day simulation experiment. In the field study, plant coverage, season, and their interaction all had a significant effect on most physicochemical parameters. Compared with C-0, the Secchi depth and pH of the water were higher, while the total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were lower when submerged vegetation was present. Lowest values of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and conductivity all appeared under C-50. Meanwhile, in the simulation experiment, the total nitrogen content decreased by 76.43, 90.98, 88.28 and 84.32%, and the total phosphorus content decreased by 85.15, 88.48, 87.76 and 79.00% at C-25, C-50, C-75 and C-90 compared with C-0, respectively. Moreover, plant coverage and time had a significant effect on all eight physiochemical parameters. There were no significant differences in the total nitrogen content among C-50, C-75 and C-90, but values were significantly lower than at C-0 and C-25. In contrast, the total phosphorus content was significantly higher at C-0 than all other groups, and the lowest value was observed at C-50. Overall, these findings suggest that 50% is the optimal submerged macrophyte coverage for improvements in water quality in temperate shallow lakes.

Micro-aerobic bacterial methane oxidation in the chemocline and anoxic water column of deep south-Alpine Lake Lugano (Switzerland)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured seasonal variations in the vertical distribution of methane concentration, methane oxidation rates, and lipid biomarkers in the northern basin of Lake Lugano. Methane consumption below the oxic-anoxic interface co-occurred with concentration maxima of C-13-depleted C-16 fatty acid biomarkers (with delta C-13 values as low as -70 parts per thousand) in the anoxic water column, as well as characteristic delta C-13(CH4) profiles. We argue that the conspicuous methane concentration gradients are primarily driven by (micro-) aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) below the chemocline. We measured a strong MOx potential throughout the anoxic water column, while MOx rates at in situ O-2 concentration >10 nmol L-1 were undetectable. Similarly, we found MOx-related biomarkers and gene sequences encoding the particulate methane monooxygenase in the anoxic, but not the oxic, water. The mechanism of (episodic) oxygen supply sustaining the MOx community in anoxic waters is still uncertain. Our results indicate that a bacterial methanotrophic community is responsible for the methane consumption in Lake Lugano, without detectable contribution from archaeal methanotrophs. Bacterial populations that accumulated both at the suboxic-anoxic interface and in the deeper anoxic hypolimnion, where maximum potential MOx rates were observed throughout the year (1.5-2.5 mu mol L-1 d(-1)) were mainly related to Methylobacter sp. Close relatives are found in lacustrine environments throughout the world, and their potential to thrive under micro-and anoxic conditions in Lake Lugano may imply that micro-aerobic methane oxidation is important in methane cycling and competition for methane and oxygen in stratified lakes worldwide.

These include wooden spears and shorter double-pointed sticks, discovered in association with herbivores that were hunted and butchered along a lakeshore. Wooden tools have not been systematically analysed to the same standard as other Palaeolithic technologies, such as lithic or bone tools. Our multianalytical study includes micro-CT scanning, 3-dimensional microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, supporting a systematic technological and taphonomic analysis, thus setting a new standard for wooden tool analysis. In illustrating the biography of one of Schoningen's double-pointed sticks, we demonstrate new human behaviours for this time period, including sophisticated woodworking techniques. The hominins selected a spruce branch which they then debarked and shaped into an aerodynamic and ergonomic tool. They likely seasoned the wood to avoid cracking and warping. After a long period of use, it was probably lost while hunting, and was then rapidly buried in mud. Taphonomic alterations include damage from trampling, fungal attack, root damage and compression. Through our detailed analysis we show that Middle Pleistocene humans had a rich awareness of raw material properties, and possessed sophisticated woodworking skills. Alongside new detailed morphometrics of the object, an ethnographic review supports a primary function as a throwing stick for hunting, indicating potential hunting strategies and social contexts including for communal hunts involving children. The Schoningen throwing sticks may have been used to strategically disadvantage larger ungulates, potentially from distances of up to 30 metres. They also demonstrate that the hominins were technologically capable of capturing smaller fast prey and avian fauna, a behaviour evidenced at contemporaneous Middle Pleistocene archaeological sites.					; Lehmann, Jens/AAP-1318-2021; Wachtendorf, Volker/A-3983-2014	Leder, Dirk/0000-0002-6249-5323; Milks, Annemieke/0000-0003-0779-6200; Koddenberg, Tim/0000-0002-1908-9864; Wachtendorf, Volker/0000-0001-9549-7416; Bohner, Utz/0000-0001-8566-6394													1932-6203					JUL 19	2023	18	7							e0287719	10.1371/journal.pone.0287719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287719								37467169					WOS:001034831500045

We collected SG samples during the dry and wet seasons in 2018 and 2019, and the potential NO3--N sources and their fates were identified in SG by NO3- isotopes and hydrochemical methods. Our results showed that the NO3--N concentrations in the SG in the wet season in farmland were far higher than those in the dry season in residential areas. The high variation in delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- (from -12.78 parts per thousand to +18.10 parts per thousand and -27.62 parts per thousand to +23.07 parts per thousand, respectively, in the farmland and from -5.34 parts per thousand to +34.54 parts per thousand and -20.04 parts per thousand to +17.47 parts per thousand, respectively, in the residential area) indicated multiple NO3--N sources in the SG. The NO3--N in the farmland mainly originated from chemical nitrogen fertilizer (NF, 36%), soil nitrogen (SN, 33%) and manure and sewage (M&S, 24%) in the dry season and from SN (61%) and NF (33%) in the wet season. The NO3--N in the residential area mainly originated from M&S (57%), SN (23%) and NF (14%) in the dry season and from SN (50%), NF (25%) and M&S (24%) in the wet season. Nitrogen transformation was dominated by denitrification in the SG. The most polluted SG area was observed on the east bank of Erhai Lake, NO3--N mainly originated from NF. But the NO3--N pollution slowed down from high altitude to lakeside and had multiple NO3--N sources on the west bank of Erhai Lake. The SG was contaminated by nitrogen from NF, SN and M&S along the flow path and flowed into Erhai Lake. Therefore, reducing soil nitrogen concentrations and chemical nitrogen fertilizer applications and improving sewage facilities are significant ways to mitigate nitrate pollution in the SG.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 15	2020	270								110897	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110897								32721332					WOS:000554920300077

This manganese enrichment was assumed to be associated with recent eutrophication of the formerly oligotrophic lake. The mechanisms and processes involved were examined by analysing: (i) short sediment cores obtained from seven locations along a depth transect ranging from 69.5 m (the deepest point) to 38 m; (ii) sediment traps located at 20 m and 60 m water depths; (iii) water column profiles; and (iv) porewater profiles at 69.5 m and 58 m depths. Sedimentary Mn enrichment was observed at water depths below 56 m and increased to more than 25 wt% at the deepest site. Between 2010 and 2017, Mn accumulation at the deepest site was 815 g Mn m(-2). Transfer of Mn from the shallower towards the deepest parts of the lake was initiated by reductive dissolution of MnOx and diffusion of dissolved Mn from the sediment to the overlying water column. Manganese was then dissipated via turbulent mixing and subsequently oxidised to MnOx before being transported towards the deepest zone. Transformation of the redeposited MnOx to Mn(Ca)CO3 favoured the final burial of Mn. We show that eutrophication and the areal spreading of anoxic conditions may intensify diagenetic processes and cause the spatial redistribution of Mn as well as its effective burial. Contrary to many previous findings, we show that increases of Mn and Mn/Fe can also be used as indicators for increasing anoxic conditions in previously oligotrophic lakes.					; Casper, Peter/B-7384-2011; Goldhammer, Tobias/AAG-8100-2019; Arz, Helge/A-6659-2013; Scholtysik, Grzegorz/AAM-9406-2021; Roeser, Patricia/A-7679-2012	Dellwig, Olaf/0000-0002-0028-8812; Casper, Peter/0000-0002-5956-4674; Goldhammer, Tobias/0000-0001-8897-4659; Arz, Helge Wolfgang/0000-0002-1997-1718; Roeser, Patricia/0000-0002-5604-1827													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2020	151	2-3					313	334		10.1007/s10533-020-00729-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-020-00729-9		NOV 2020											WOS:000592135800001

With this assumption, we investigated the concentrations, fluxes, and sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the atmospheric wet deposition (AWD) of the Lake Qinghai Watershed (LQW), which is the largest inland lake in China, for one year from October 2017 to September 2018. The results showed that the annual volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations (mg L-1) in the AWD were 1.97 for NH4+-N, 0.55 for NO3- -N, 0.04 for NO2--N, 0.77 for dissolved organic N (DON), 3.33 for total dissolved N (TDN), 0.30 for dissolved inorganic P (DIP), 0.07 for dissolved organic P (DOP), 0.36 for total dissolved P (TDP), and 0.99 for reactive sulfur (SO42--S). The annual AWD fluxes of TDN and TDP were 16.82 and 1.86 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Strong dilution effects in the wet season, a long residency time of nutrient-rich aerosols in the dry season, strong ammonia volatilization in the wet and warm seasons, and moisture sources dominated the seasonal or monthly changing characteristics of N and P concentrations in the AWD, including high in the wet season and low in the dry season for NH4+-N, low in the wet season and high in the dry season for NO3--N, and generally increasing from April to September for DIP and DOP. Precipitation quantity dominated the monthly changes in the N and P fluxes of the AWD, which gradually increased from April to August and then decreased in September. N and P in the AWD mostly originated from anthropogenic sources. High ammonia volatilization from local intense animal husbandry, alkaline soils and lakes led to a relatively high NH4+-N concentration compared with other sites of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, and in the world. The N/P molar ratio in the precipitation was higher than 16, which might have effect on the aquatic ecosystems of Lake Qinghai. Ammonia volatilization fluxes and atmospheric dry deposition fluxes of N and P should be further studied to completely understand the geochemical cycles of N and P in the LQW. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores seasonal and annual trends of rainfall in the Lake Tana basin (LTB) and their teleconnections with global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the period between 1979 and 2015. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimate are applied to the rainfall data collected from the National Meteorology Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia for detecting and estimating rainfall trends. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficient method is used to determine the effect of SST variations on rainfall. The assessment of rainfall trends indicates that the amount of annual rainfall in the Lake Tana basin is increasing, but the rate of increase is not statistically significant. Seasonal analysis reveals that the smallest amount of rainfall occurs in the Bega season, and this season is getting drier with time. However, the analysis indicates that the other two seasons (Belg and Kiremt) are becoming wetter. The rainfall in Kiremt is increasing significantly (significant at the p = 0.05 level) in Debre Tabor station with a rate of 10.20 mm/year. Besides, 78.1% of the total annual rainfall in the basin occurs during this rainy (Kiremt) season, whereas Bega and Belg contribute some 9.4% and 12.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation analysis of rainfall and SSTs indicates that rainfall of the LTB is highly affected by the variations of SSTs.

A non-channelized depositional model is proposed in this paper for nearshore subaqueous fans in steep fault-controlled slopes of lacustrine rift basins. The deposits of nearshore subaqueous fans along the base of steep border-fault slopes of rift basins are typically composed of deep-water coarse-grained sediment gravity-flow deposits directly sourced from adjacent footwalls. Sedimentation processes of nearshore subaqueous fans respond to tectonic activities of boundary faults and to seasonal rainfall. During tectonically active stages, subaqueous debris flows triggered by episodic movements of border-faults dominate the sedimentation. During tectonically quiescent stages, hyperpycnal flows generated by seasonal rainfall-generated floods, normal discharges of mountain-derived rivers and deep-lacustrine suspension sedimentation are commonly present. The results of a series of flume tank depositional simulations show that the sediments deposited by subaqueous debris flows are wedge-shaped and non-channelized, whereas the sediments deposited by hyperpycnal flows generated by sporadic floods from seasonal rainfall are characterized by non-channelized, coarse-grained lobate depositional bodies which switch laterally because of compensation sedimentation of hyperpycanal flows. The hyperpycnal-flow-deposited non-channelized lobate depositional bodies can be divided into a main body and lateral edges. The main body can be further subdivided into a proximal part, middle part and frontal part. Normal mountain-derived river-discharge-deposited sediments are characterized by thin-bedded, fine-grained sandstones and siltstones with a limited distribution range. Normal mountain-derived river-discharge-deposited sediments and deep-lacustrine mudstones are commonly eroded in the area close to boundary faults. A nearshore subaqueous fan can be divided into three segments: inner fan, middle fan and outer fan. The inner fan is composed of debrites and the proximal part of the main body. The middle fan consists of the middle part of the main body and lateral edges, normal mountain-derived river-discharge-deposited fine-grained sediments and deep-lacustrine mudstones. The outer fan comprises the frontal part of the main body, lateral edges, and deep-lacustrine mudstones. Based on the non-channelized depositional model for nearshore subaqueous fans, criteria for stratigraphic subdivision and correlation are discussed and applied.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2018	65	6					2117	2148		10.1111/sed.12459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12459													WOS:000445275300012

The success of future water management will rely upon having detailed data of current and historic water dynamics. This research leverages Google Earth Engine and uses Landsat 5 imagery in conjunction with bathymetry and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model data to analyze long-term lake dynamics (water surface elevation, surface area, volume, volume change, and frequency) for Lake McConaughy in Nebraska, USA. Water surface elevation was estimated by extracting elevation values from underlying bathymetry and digital elevations models using 5,994 different combinations of water indices, water boundaries, and statistics for 100 time periods spanning 1985-2009. Surface elevation calculations were as accurate as 0.768 m root mean square error (CI95% [0.657, 0.885]). Water volume change calculations found a maximum change of 1.568 km(3) and a minimum total volume of only 23.97% of the maximum reservoir volume. Seasonal and long-term trends were identified, which have major affects regarding regional agriculture, local recreation, and lake water quality. This research fills an existing gap in optical remote sensing-based monitoring of lakes and reservoirs, is more robust and outperforms other commonly used monitoring techniques, increases the number of water bodies available for long-term studies, introduces a scalable framework deployable within Google Earth Engine, and enables data collection of both gauged and ungauged water bodies, which will substantially increase our knowledge and understanding of these critical ecosystems.					; 李, 海星/ABE-6456-2021	Weekley, David/0000-0002-4123-6023; ?, ??/0000-0003-1636-2922													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV	2019	55	11					8350	8367		10.1029/2019WR025500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025500		NOV 2019											WOS:000493602000001

The lake receives terrestrial stream runoff from surrounding coniferous forest soils and peatlands having a low pH (4.6) and high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM, annual average: 45 mg L-1), Fe (60 mu M), sulfate (105 mu M), inorganic Hg (1200 pM) and MeHg (250 pM). Sulfur K-edge XANES and Hg L-m-edge EXAFS spectroscopic measurements were used to characterize and quantify the sulfur speciation in the lake sediment at nine occasions, covering different seasons in the years of 2007 and 2009. In the surface sediment (0-3 cm) sulfate is reduced to zero-valent S and inorganic sulfide, that in turn reacts with Fe to form FeSm (mackinawite) and FeS2 (framboidal pyrite). The latter mineral becomes increasingly dominant by depth in the sediment. Thermodynamic modeling successfully predicted measured porewater concentrations of Hg in the sediment. Metacinnabar (beta-HgS) and Hg(NOM-RS)(2) complexes (the latter formed as a reaction between Hg(II) and thiol groups associated with natural organic matter, NOM-RSH) were the dominant forms of Hg(II) in the solid phase of sediments and Hg(II)-polysulfides (aq) dominated in the porewater. We argue that FeS m is a key component that indirectly controlled the Hg (II) speciation in the sediment by keeping the aqueous phase concentration of inorganic sulfide in the 0.5-2 mu M range throughout the year. Besides providing a pool of readily soluble inorganic sulfide for formation of beta-HgS(s), as demonstrated by previously reported EXAFS experiments, we further suggest FeS m may serve as a precursor for the formation of a more crystalline (less soluble) beta-HgS(s) phase than present in environments devoid of FeSm. Support for this was provided by comparing our results with previously reported thermodynamic modelling results of Hg(II) and MeHg solubility in organic soils devoid of FeSm. In more general terms, we suggest the presence or absence of FeSm, through its influence on the chemical speciation of Hg and MeHg, may be a key factor behind the variability in rates of Hg(II) and MeHg transformation processes, such as methylation, reduction and demethylation, reported for different environmental settings.

Interactive effects of light and nutrients on stream algal growth modified by forest management in boreal landscapes	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Boreal forests account for 30% of the world?s total forest cover and in many places are subject to intensive forest management, which often involves complete removal of overstory vegetation by clear-cutting. However, we still do not fully understand how forest management affects aquatic ecosystems in these landscapes. Here we asked how forest management-induced changes in environmental conditions, such as incident light and nutrient availability, affect benthic algal growth and nutrient limitation in boreal headwater streams of northern Sweden. We answered this question using a combination of correlative and experimental approaches across a range of forested streams spanning a gradient of site (e.g. canopy openness and water chemistry) and catchment-level (e. g. age of forest regrowth) parameters, with variation among the study streams influenced by different forest management histories and underlying natural variation. We found that benthic algal growth in these forested streams was largely driven by local interactions between dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) availability and incident light reaching benthic surfaces. Greater water temperature and shallower depths were also associated with greater algal growth. Although high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations often play a role in reducing light availability to autotrophs in boreal aquatic systems, it was not an important predictor of algal growth in small forested streams despite a large DOC concentration gradient (5 ? 32 mg/L). Results from experimental nutrient additions supported the role of N as a key limiting nutrient, but also revealed both spatial and seasonal factors that modulate the effects of altered nutrient availability. Overall, our results suggest that differences in how light regimes and nutrient loading respond to forest management generate small-scale variation in the controls over stream primary productivity, which likely shift in relative importance at the time scale of a forest rotation (60 to 100 years).

Here, we investigate the subglacial hydrology of Kronebreen, a fast-flowing tidewater glacier in Svalbard during the 2014 melt season. We combine observations of borehole water pressure, supraglacial lake drainage, surface velocities and plume activity with modelled run-off and water routing to develop a conceptual model that thoroughly encapsulates subglacial drainage at a tidewater glacier. Simultaneous measurements suggest that an early-season episode of subglacial flushing took place during our observation period, and a stable efficient drainage system effectively transported subglacial water through the northern region of the glacier tongue. Drainage pathways through the central and southern regions of the glacier tongue were disrupted throughout the following melt season. Periodic plume activity at the terminus appears to be a signal for modulated subglacial pulsing, i.e. an internally driven storage and release of subglacial meltwater that operates independently of marine influences. This storage is a key control on ice flow in the 2014 melt season. Evidence from this work and previous studies strongly suggests that long-term changes in ice flow at Kronebreen are controlled by the location of efficient/inefficient drainage and the position of regions where water is stored and released.					; How, Penelope/ABE-3109-2021; Luckman, Adrian/GVS-1716-2022	van Pelt, Ward/0000-0003-4839-7900; Luckman, Adrian/0000-0002-9618-5905; How, Penelope/0000-0002-8088-8497; Hubbard, Bryn/0000-0002-3565-3875; Benn, Douglas/0000-0002-3604-0886; Lindback, Katrin/0000-0002-5941-6743; Kohler, Jack/0000-0003-1963-054X													1994-0416	1994-0424				NOV 21	2017	11	6					2691	2710		10.5194/tc-11-2691-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2691-2017													WOS:000415829000003

Modeling suspended sediment distribution patterns of the Amazon River using MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79 < R-2 < 0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth.

Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Instrument (OLI) data offer unique opportunities for investigating certain in-water constituents (e.g., TSM and chlorophyll-a) owing to their spatial resolution (10-60 m). In this framework, we assessed the potential of MSI-OLI combined data in characterizing the multi-temporal (2014-2018) TSM variability in Pertusillo Lake (Basilicata region, Southern Italy). We developed and validated a customized MSI-based TSM model (R-2= 0.81) by exploiting ground measurements acquired during specific measurement campaigns. The model was then exported as OLI data through an intercalibration procedure (R-2= 0.87), allowing for the generation of a TSM multi-temporal MSI-OLI merged dataset. The analysis of the derived multi-year TSM monthly maps showed the influence of hydrological factors on the TSM seasonal dynamics over two sub-regions of the lake, the west and east areas. The western side is more influenced by inflowing rivers and water level fluctuations, the effects of which tend to longitudinally decrease, leading to less sediment within the eastern sub-area. The achieved results can be exploited by regional authorities for better management of inland water quality and monitoring systems.					; lacava, teodosio/I-4357-2014; Lacava, Teodosio/I-4357-2014; Tramutoli, Valerio/E-6706-2011; Pascucci, Simone/I-8172-2019; Pergola, Nicola/I-1236-2014; palombo, angelo/A-3068-2013; Campanelli, Alessandra/ABD-5099-2021; Morano, Stefano/A-4640-2008; Pignatti Morano, Stefano/A-4640-2008	Palombo, Angelo/0000-0003-1746-0057; Satriano, Valeria/0000-0003-2264-3579; lacava, teodosio/0000-0002-6732-4419; Pascucci, Simone/0000-0002-8311-8615; Tramutoli, Valerio/0000-0003-3875-7909; Pergola, Nicola/0000-0001-7619-6685; Ciancia, Emanuele/0000-0003-0335-2565; CAMPANELLI, ALESSANDRA/0000-0003-4818-3996; Pignatti Morano, Stefano/0000-0002-0587-8926														2072-4292				JUL	2020	12	13							2147	10.3390/rs12132147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12132147													WOS:000550818400001

Shifts in fish community composition and structure linked to seasonality in a tropical river	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The seasonality of tropical rivers, induced mainly by water level changes, shapes many interrelated aspects of ecological communities and the populations they contain, including animal movement, feeding, growth, and reproductive activity. However, the role played by seasonality in structuring the diversity of tropical assemblages is not yet fully understood. We examined the effects of seasonality on community structure and composition of benthic fish assemblages comparing two consecutive receding and rising water seasons in a major tributary of the Amazon basin. We quantified seasonal shifts in species abundance distributions and in composition using a multivariate dispersion test, total beta diversity and its decomposition into local (LCBD) and species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD). Additionally, we tested for relationships between LCBD values and richness, total abundance, and environmental variables. Many benthic fish species were rare in terms of numerical abundance. Rarity was most pronounced in the rising seasons, which had a higher proportion of singletons. A logseries was the best-fit model for both the receding and one of the rising season's species abundance distributions, while a lognormal was selected for the second rising season. We detected variation in species composition between seasons-the rising seasons were distinct from one another in terms of species composition, as well as differing from the receding seasons. LCBD showed strong negative relationships with species richness and total abundance, particularly in the rising seasons, indicating that seasons with high uniqueness in their composition also had low richness and abundance. LCBD was negatively correlated with temperature, while depth presented a positive relationship, as observed mainly in rising seasons with colder temperatures and greater water depth. Approximately one third of the species had higher than average SCBD values and were considered major contributors to beta diversity. These significant seasonal differences in both species relative abundances and assemblage composition might be explained by the asymmetrical spatial use of habitats during different seasons, strongly suggesting the importance of the flood-pulse cycle for maintaining diversity in this environment. Studies that seek to identify the species inhabiting a particular environment (e.g. bottom rivers habitats) and the factors that affect the dynamics, structure and composition of these communities are fundamental for future management and conservation. This is particularly urgent for understudied tropical freshwater ecosystems, as human pressures including anthropogenic climate change are expected to become increasingly severe. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns modify water temperature and flow regimes, thus affecting the hydrologic regime that determines the structure and dynamics of the ecological communities, with potential consequences for their integrity.					; Duarte, Cleber/ABD-5290-2021; Antao, Laura/GPX-7616-2022; Antão, Laura/GPX-7616-2022; Magurran, Anne/D-7463-2013	Duarte, Cleber/0000-0002-1036-5850; Antao, Laura/0000-0001-6612-9366; Magurran, Anne/0000-0002-0036-2795; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2022	67	10					1789	1800		10.1111/fwb.13975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13975		JUL 2022											WOS:000828812500001

CO2 evasion from a steep, high gradient stream network: importance of seasonal and diurnal variation in aquatic pCO2 and gas transfer	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Surface waters contribute substantially to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. However, global estimates remain uncertain due to methodological difficulties, such as in precisely estimating gas transfer in steep upland streams. Here, we addressed the question of what drives CO2 evasion from steep mountainous stream network of the European Alps by assessing the spatial and temporal variation of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) for 148 streams and the gas transfer coefficient for CO2 (k(CO2)) for 88 locations within this 254 km(2) watershed. Results show that log k(CO2) can be predicted reasonably well (r(2)=0.71, p<0.001, n=88) using a statistical model based on slope, average width, flow velocity and stream discharge. Also, most sites were supersaturated in CO2 with significant variation in pCO(2) due to season (September vs. December) and time of day (day vs. night), but not stream order. Resulting median CO2 evasion rates were 145, 119, 46, 43, and 50 mg C m(-2) h(-1) at 1(st) to 5(th) order streams, respectively. CO2 evasion was dependent on season and time of day, with the highest evasion (184.0 kg C h(-1)) during growing season at nighttime, followed by 124.6 kg C h(-1) during daytime. Dormant season nighttime evasion was 30.9 kg C h(-1) and daytime evasion only 17.1 kg C h(-1). Overall we conclude that CO2 evasion of steep mountainous streams depends on seasonal and diurnal variation in pCO(2) and reach-specific variability in k(CO2). These controls strongly alter landscape-scale CO2 evasion estimates, with implications for regional to global carbon budgets.					; Singer, Gabriel/JBR-8741-2023; BAttin, Tom/H-7971-2012; Schelker, Jakob/H-3734-2018	Singer, Gabriel/0000-0002-7389-9788; Schelker, Jakob/0000-0002-0274-7605; Ulseth, Amber/0000-0002-5554-596X													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2016	61	5					1826	1838		10.1002/lno.10339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10339													WOS:000383621800020

Perceived Vulnerability and Climate Change Impacts on Small-Scale Fisheries in Davao Gulf, Philippines	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The small-scale fisheries play a critical role in food security and income of coastal fishing communities. However, climate variability and its impacts are affecting fishers, their communities, and fishing grounds. This study aimed to determine the perceived impacts of climate change and vulnerability of small-scale fisheries in selected fishing communities around the Davao Gulf. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather data on the perceptions of fishers (N = 220) on the impacts of climate change on their livelihood and communities. Seven focus groups corroborated the collected data and conclusions reached (N = 15). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the sources of vulnerability and number of impacts of climate change. Regression was used to determine factors influencing the catch per unit effort (CPUE). The PCA results showed that for the vulnerability, the sources, coral bleaching, inadequate food, lack of credit access, changes in weather pattern and hotter temperature contributed highly. For the climate change impacts, the factors, less seasonality, unclear reproductive patterns, diseases in the catch, invasive species, decrease in catch and venturing farther to fish offshore were substantially influential. Further analysis showed that disease and invasive species, decrease in fish catch, fishing farther offshore, and monthly income affected the CPUE of the fisheries. Recommendations for climate change vulnerability reduction based on the conclusions reached in this study include more financial credit access, apprehension of illegal fishers, increased capacity building and technical skills for coastal communities, supplemental livelihoods, and information dissemination on climate change adaptation strategies.

However, few methods exist to directly estimate hydrological changes and even fewer result in quantitative data, impeding our understanding of the timing, magnitude and mechanisms of hydrological changes. Here we present a novel approach based on delta H-2 values of sedimentary lipid biomarkers in combination with plant physiological modeling to extract quantitative information on past changes in relative humidity. Our initial application to an annually laminated lacustrine sediment sequence from western Europe deposited during the Younger Dryas cold period revealed relative humidity changes of up to 15% over sub-centennial timescales, leading to major ecosystem changes, in agreement with palynological data from the region.

Mowing Submerged Macrophytes in Shallow Lakes with Alternative Stable States: Battling the Good Guys?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Submerged macrophytes play an important role in maintaining good water quality in shallow lakes. Yet extensive stands easily interfere with various services provided by these lakes, and harvesting is increasingly applied as a management measure. Because shallow lakes may possess alternative stable states over a wide range of environmental conditions, designing a successful mowing strategy is challenging, given the important role of macrophytes in stabilizing the clear water state. In this study, the integrated ecosystem model PCLake is used to explore the consequences of mowing, in terms of reducing nuisance and ecosystem stability, for a wide range of external nutrient loadings, mowing intensities and timings. Elodea is used as a model species. Additionally, we use PCLake to estimate how much phosphorus is removed with the harvested biomass, and evaluate the long-term effect of harvesting. Our model indicates that mowing can temporarily reduce nuisance caused by submerged plants in the first weeks after cutting, particularly when external nutrient loading is fairly low. The risk of instigating a regime shift can be tempered by mowing halfway the growing season when the resilience of the system is highest, as our model showed. Up to half of the phosphorus entering the system can potentially be removed along with the harvested biomass. As a result, prolonged mowing can prevent an oligo-to mesotrophic lake from becoming eutrophic to a certain extent, as our model shows that the critical nutrient loading, where the lake shifts to the turbid phytoplankton-dominated state, can be slightly increased.					; Mooij, Wolf/C-2677-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Bakker, Elisabeth/B-7185-2008	Janssen, Annette/0000-0001-5000-7161; Mooij, Wolf/0000-0001-5586-8200; Kuiper, Jan J./0000-0002-6655-9355; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Brederveld, Bob/0009-0006-3062-1432; Bakker, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5900-9136													0364-152X	1432-1009				APR	2017	59	4					619	634		10.1007/s00267-016-0811-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-016-0811-2								28044182					WOS:000400444400008

To identify the variation property and the main causes of eutrophication and continuous water quality deterioration, the water quality, including the water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, Chl-a, turbidity, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), of Lake Xingyun was monitored from 2016 to 2021, and their spatial and temporal distribution characteristics were analyzed. The results show that there is no obvious thermal stratification in the vertical direction; pH and DO decrease with depth, which is caused by both physical and biochemical processes, especially at the bottom of Lake Xingyun, which has an anaerobic environment. The chlorophyll content was higher during the high-flow periods and varied significantly in the vertical direction; the spatial variation of water quality in Lake Xingyun was more obvious in the low-flow period and alkaline throughout the year. The average content of total phosphorus (TP) ranged between 0.33 and 0.53 mg/L during the high-flow periods and between 0.22 and 0.51 mg/L during the low-flow periods, while the average content of total nitrogen (TN) ranged between 1.92 and 2.62 mg/L and 1.36 and 2.53 mg/L during the high- and low-flow periods, respectively. The analysis of the inflow samples shows that exogenous nitrogen and phosphorus is the main pollution source affecting the nitrogen and phosphorus content of Lake Xingyun. The trophic level index (TLI) shows that Lake Xingyun is in eutrophication all year round, and even in areas less affected by the exogenous nutrient, there are still conditions for cyanobacterial blooms. This study shed new light on the water quality, eutrophication status and changes in Lake Xingyun, providing suggestions for controlling lake pollution and eutrophication mitigation.

Mart.) Solms, water hyacinth, absorbs heavy metals (HMs) into four plant organs (laminae, petioles, roots, and stolons). This study considers the absorption of nine HMs (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn), and the E. crassipes evaluated in this study were located in three irrigation canals in the North Nile Delta in Egypt, with sampling being conducted in both monospecific and homogenous E. crassipes. Samples of both E. crassipes and water were collected on a monthly basis during one growing season. Analysis of the water samples showed that the HM concentrations ranged from 1.1 mu g/l for Cd to 2079.8 mu g/l for Fe. All HMs were more concentrated in the E. crassipes roots than in any other organ. Typically, there was a significant correlation between the HM levels in the water and the HM levels in the E. crassipes organs. E. crassipes was documented by a bioconcentration factor > 1.0 for all HMs. The translocation factor in this study was <1.0 for all HMs. The t-values that referred to the discrepancies between the measured and predicted values of the HMs in the four E. crassipes organs were not significant. This finding can be considered to be an indication of the goodness of fit with respect to the ability of the equations to forecast HM uptake. Therefore, the developed equations will benefit the prediction of HM uptake by E. crassipes grown in irrigation canals in the Nile Delta. The efficacy of E. crassipes as a metric for gauging the aggregate impact of environmental pollution in water sources and its potential application in biomonitoring are confirmed in this study.

The young water fraction (Fyw) of streamflow, which can be accurately estimated with tracer data, is effective at characterizing the water age proportions of heterogeneous catchments. However, the Fyw values of permafrost catchments are not known. We selected a watershed in the permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) as our study area. Daily interval stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18) of precipitation and streamflow were studied during the 2009 thawing season. The results show that the stable isotope compositions of precipitation and stream water have significant spatial and temporal variations. HYSPLIT backwards trajectory results demonstrate that the moisture in the study area mainly derived from the westerlies and southern monsoons. Thawing processes in the active layer of the permafrost significantly altered the stable isotope compositions of the stream water. The soil temperature, soil moisture, and air temperature are the main drivers of the stable isotope variations in the stream water. We estimated the young water fractions of the five catchments in the study area, which were the first estimates of the Fyw in permafrost catchments in the QTP. The results show that an average of 15% of the streamflow is younger than 43 days. Additional analyses show that the vegetation cover significantly controls the young water fraction of the streamflow. These results will improve our understanding of permafrost hydrological processes and water resource utilization and protection.					; Song, Chunlin/AGU-3084-2022	Song, Chunlin/0000-0003-3627-2350; Wang, Genxu/0000-0002-3403-0983; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB	2017	31	4					935	947		10.1002/hyp.11077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11077													WOS:000393560800016

Limits to future expansion of surface-melt-enhanced ice flow into the interior of western Greenland	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Moulins are important conduits for surface meltwater to reach the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet. It has been proposed that in a warming climate, newly formed moulins associated with the inland migration of supraglacial lakes could introduce surface melt to new regions of the bed, introducing or enhancing sliding there. By examining surface strain rates, we found that the upper limit to where crevasses, and therefore moulins, are likely to form is similar to 1600m. This is also roughly the elevation above which lakes do not drain completely. Thus, meltwater above this elevation will largely flow tens of kilometers through surface streams into existing moulins downstream. Furthermore, results from a thermal ice sheet model indicate that the similar to 1600m crevassing limit is well below the wet-frozen basal transition (similar to 2000m). Together, these data sets suggest that new supraglacial lakes will have a limited effect on the inland expansion of melt-induced seasonal acceleration.

J	Condron, LM; Newman, S				Condron, Leo M.; Newman, Susan			Revisiting the fundamentals of phosphorus fractionation of sediments and soils	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Sequential fractionation procedures have been an important tool in the study of phosphorus (P) dynamics in soils and sediments for over 50 years. Throughout this period, the various methodologies have been thoroughly reviewed, and several limitations are widely acknowledged, but there are also aspects of P fractionation that have received little or no discussion. As there are few alternatives to fractionation procedures, in order to advance the usefulness of these techniques, we need to explore the undisclosed variables that may falsely bias our interpretation. This article highlights specific fundamental components of P fractionation, including sample preparation and handling, determination of P in extracts, fraction validation and residual P. While researchers have project-specific objectives, we provide guidelines on how to minimise the influence of these confounding variables. For example, we recommend that samples be maintained and extracted under in situ moisture and oxic/anoxic conditions, especially with sediments. In addition, care needs to be taken to ensure the extraction process supports the operational definition, avoiding carryover and neutralisation between successive extractions. Despite the extensive use of these procedures, we will only be able to move away from operational definitions by validating links between extraction and reactivity, and our understanding of this key component is still limited. To provide some focus for this, we make specific recommendations on fractionation procedures to be used in the assessment of P transformations in various types of soil and sediments, dependent on the study objective.

D.			Groundwater dependence of coastal lagoons: The case of La Pletera salt marshes (NE Catalonia)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems of the world, playing an important role in coastal defense and wildlife conservation. These ecosystems, however, are usually affected by human activities, which may cause a loss and degradation of their ecological status, a decline of their biodiversity, an alteration of their ecological functioning, and a limitation of their ecosystem services. La Pletera salt marshes (NE Spain) are located in a region mainly dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. Part of these wetlands and lagoons has been affected by an incomplete construction of an urban development and in this moment is the focus of a Life(+) project, whose aim is to restore this protected area. Several studies have analyzed the role of hydrological regime in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in this area, however, the role of groundwater was never considered as a relevant factor in the lagoon dynamics, and its influence is still unknown. In this study, the hydrogeological dynamics in La Pletera salt marshes has been analyzed, as a basis to set sustainable management guidelines for this area. In order to determine their dependence on groundwater resources, monthly hydrochemical (with major ions and nutrients) and isotopic (delta O-18(H2O) and delta D) campaigns have been conducted, from November 2014 to October 2015. In particular, groundwater from six wells, surface water from two nearby streams and three permanent lagoons, and sea water was considered in these surveys. Taking into account the meteorological data and the water levels in the lagoons, the General Lake Model has been conducted to determine, not only evaporation and rainfall occurring in the lagoons, but also the total inflows and outflows. In addition, the Gonfiantini isotopic model, together with equilibrium chemical-speciation/mass transfer models, has been used to analyze the evaporation and the physicochemical processes affecting the lagoons. Results show that during the dry season groundwater inputs may account for 15-80% of the water in La Pletera lagoons. Besides, water salinity depends on two main processes: 1) mixing of fresh and sea water occurring within the lagoons or in the aquifer; and 2) evaporation. According to the obtained results, the goal of preserving La Pletera lagoons and their salinity conditions implies maintaining groundwater fluxes towards the ocean, and also the hydraulic connectivity of these lagoons with the aquifer.

APD Contributors	Holocene changes in African vegetation: tradeoff between climate and water availability	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Although past climate change is well documented in West Africa through instrumental records, modeling activities, and paleo-data, little is known about regional-scale ecosystem vulnerability and long-term impacts of climate on plant distribution and biodiversity. Here we use paleohydrological and paleobotanical data to discuss the relation between available surface water, monsoon rainfall and vegetation distribution in West Africa during the Holocene. The individual patterns of plant migration or community shifts in latitude are explained by differences among tolerance limits of species to rainfall amount and seasonality. Using the probability density function methodology, we show here that the widespread development of lakes, wetlands and rivers at the time of the "Green Sahara" played an additional role in forming a network of topographically defined water availability, allowing for tropical plants to migrate north from 15 to 24 degrees N (reached ca. 9 cal ka BP). The analysis of the spatiotemporal changes in biodiversity, through both pollen occurrence and richness, shows that the core of the tropical rainbelt associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone was centered at 15-20 degrees N during the early Holocene wet period, with comparatively drier/more seasonal climate conditions south of 15 degrees N.

J	Jo, CD; Kwon, HG				Jo, Chang Dae; Kwon, Heon Gak			Temporal and spatial evaluation of the effect of river environment changes caused by climate change on water quality	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION												Rivers are affected by environmental changes caused by the anthropogenic influence on the climate and water quality. Therefore, it is important to evaluate water quality patterns based on changes in the aquatic environment. Eight multifunctional weirs (MWs) previously constructed in the Nakdong River, South Korea, have disrupted the river flow and increased the residence time by artificial floodgate control, thereby converting the river into a series of lakes. This study evaluates water quality in the Nakdong River using principal component analysis (PCA), the water quality index (WQI) and trophic state index (TSI), and self-organizing map analysis. The PCA identified that, following the construction of the MWs, nitrogen and phosphorus-based nutrients were the major water quality variables. Analysis via WQI and TSI confirmed that the amount of pollutants increased toward the downstream area. During the dry season, a continuous degradation in water quality occurs due to reduced water quantity and stagnated flow. Meanwhile, nutrients flow into the river in the form of nonpoint sources during rainfall accelerated eutrophication of the river after the monsoon period. The results of this study confirmed the influence of the formation of stagnant waters caused by MW construction on overall water quality.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Sediment Characteristics and Methane Ebullition in Three Subarctic Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ebullition (bubbling) from climate-sensitive northern lakes remains an unconstrained source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Although the focus of many recent studies, ebullition is rarely linked to the physical characteristics of lakes. In this study we analyze the sediments of subarctic postglacial lakes and investigate how sediment properties relate to the large spatial variation in CH4 bubble flux, quantified over multiple years using bubble traps. The results show that the sediments from our lakes are rich in total organic carbon, containing 37 kg/m(3) on average. This number is roughly 40% higher than the average for yedoma deposits, which have been identified as high CH4 emitters. However, the quantity of total organic carbon is not a useful indicator of high emissions from the study lakes. Neither is the amount of CH4 in the sediment a reliable measure of ebullition potential. Instead, our data point to coarse detritus, partly from buried submerged aquatic vegetation and redeposited peat as spatial controls on fluxes, often in combination with previously established effects of incoming solar radiation and water depth. The results once again highlight the climate sensitivity of northern lakes, indicating that biological responses to warmer waters and increased energy input and heating of organic sediments during longer ice-free seasons can substantially alter future CH4 emissions.					; Varner, Ruth/E-5371-2011; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021; Phillips, Stephen/F-7239-2016	Johnson, Joel/0000-0002-5671-7209; Varner, Ruth/0000-0002-3571-6629; Fahnestock, Maria Florencia/0000-0002-0509-673X; Phillips, Stephen/0000-0003-0858-4701													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2018	123	8					2399	2411		10.1029/2017JG004298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JG004298													WOS:000445731100008

The impact of electrogenic sulfide oxidation on elemental cycling and solute fluxes in coastal sediment	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Filamentous sulfide oxidizing cable bacteria are capable of linking the oxidation of free sulfide in deep anoxic layers of marine sediments to the reduction of oxygen or nitrate in surface sediments by conducting electrons over centimeter-scale distances. Previous studies have shown that this newly discovered microbial process, referred to as electrogenic sulfide oxidation (e-SOx), may alter elemental cycling in sediments, but the nature and rates of the resulting biogeochemical transformations and their influence on benthic-pelagic coupling remain largely unknown. Here we quantify changes in sediment geochemistry and solute fluxes at the sediment-water interface as e-SOx develops and declines over time in laboratory incubations of organic-rich sediments from a seasonally hypoxic coastal basin (Marine Lake Grevelingen, The Netherlands). Our results show that e-SOx enhanced sediment O-2 consumption and acidified subsurface sediment, resulting in the dissolution of calcium carbonate and iron sulfide minerals in deeper sediment horizons and the associated accumulation of dissolved iron, manganese, and calcium in porewater. Remobilized Fe diffusing upward was reoxidized at the sediment-water interface, producing an amorphous Fe oxide crust, while dissolved Fe diffusing downward was reprecipitated in the form of FeS as it encountered the free sulfide horizon. The development of e-SOx enhanced the diffusive release of dissolved Mn at the sediment-water interface, capped the phosphate efflux, generated a buildup of organic matter in surface sediments, and strongly stimulated the release of alkalinity from the sediment. About 75% of this alkalinity production was associated with net CaCO3 dissolution, while the remaining 25% was attributed to a pumping mechanism that transfers alkalinity from anodic H2S oxidation (an alkalinity sink) in deeper sediments to cathodic O-2 reduction (an alkalinity source) near the sediment-water interface. The resulting sediment alkalinity efflux buffers the release of dissolved inorganic carbon at the sediment-water interface, and may therefore counteract the influence of benthic respiration on coastal ocean pH. Overall, our results demonstrate that e-SOx development strongly affects the biogeochemical cycles of C, P, Ca, Fe, Mn, and S in coastal sediments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The agricultural drainage water is an important water resource which can be reused for agriculture. Thus, the current study aims to assess the quality of drainage water for irrigation purpose through monitoring and predicting its suitability for irrigation. The chemical composition of Bahr El-Baqr water drain, especially salinity, as well as ions are mainly involved in calculating indicators of water suitability for irrigation, i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO-3, Cl-, and SO42-. Further analysis was carried out to evaluate the irrigation water quality index (IWQI) through integrated approaches and artificial neural network (ANN) model. Further, ARIMA models were developed to forecast IWQI of Bahr El-Baqr drain in Egypt. The results indicated that the computed IWQI values ranged between 46 and 81. Around 11% of the samples were classified as excellent water, while 89% of the samples were categorized as good water. The results of IWQI showed a standard deviation of 8.59 with a mean of 62.25, indicating that IWQI varied by 13.79% from the average. ANN model showed much higher prediction accuracy in IWQI modeling withR(2)value greater than 0.98 during training, testing and validation. A relatively good correlation was obtained, between the actual and forecasted IWQI based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC); the best fit models were ARIMA (1,0) (0,0) without seasonality. The determination coefficient (R-2) of ARIMA models was 0.23. Accordingly, 23% of IWQI variability could be explained by different model parameters. These findings will support the water resources managers and decision-makers to manage the irrigation water resources that can be implemented in the future.

Late Miocene C4 Grassland Fire Feedbacks on the Indian Subcontinent	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												Fire dynamics potentially account for the asynchronous timing of the expansion of C-4 grasslands throughout the Mio-Pliocene world. Yet how fire, climate, and ecosystems interacted in different settings remain poorly constrained because it is difficult to quantify fires and fuel source over these timescales. Here, we apply molecular proxies for fire occurrence alongside records of vegetation change and paleohydrology in Bengal Fan sediments (ODP Leg 116) to examine fire feedbacks on the south Asian continent. We employ abundances of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to reconstruct fire occurrence and delta C-13 measurements of pyrogenic PAHs to constrain fuel source and grassland burning. This combination allowed us to test whether: (1) a fire-seasonality forcing facilitated the expansion of grassland ecosystems and (2) a fire-C-4 grass burning feedback maintained these systems. PAHs can be sourced from weathered fossil carbon (i.e., a petrogenic source) and from burned terrestrial biomass (i.e., a pyrogenic source). Alkylated and non-alkylated structure abundance data distinguished pyrogenic from petrogenic sourced samples. A sharp increase in pyrogenic PAHs along with increases in delta H-2 and delta C-13 values of plant waxes at 7.4 Ma indicates increased fire coincided with the onset of C-4 expansion and hydrologic change in South Asia. The correlated C-13 enrichment in PAHs, C-13 enrichment in plant waxes, and increased abundances of PAHs suggest burning of C-4 grasslands likely maintained open ecosystems. Our results link fire to the initial opening of grassland ecosystems on a subcontinental-scale and support disturbance as a critical mechanism of terrestrial biome transition.

Phosphorus runoff from Canadian agricultural land: A cross-region synthesis of edge-of-field results	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Algal blooms fueled by phosphorus (P) enrichment are threatening surface water quality around the world. Although P loss from arable land is a critical contributor to P loads in many agricultural watersheds, there has been a lack of understanding of P loss patterns and drivers across regions. Here, we synthesized edge-of-field P and sediment runoff data for 30 arable fields in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario (a total of 216 site-years) to elucidate spatial and temporal differences in runoff and P mobilization in snowmelt and rainfall runoff, and discuss climatic, soil and management drivers for these patterns. Across all regions, precipitation inputs were positively correlated with runoff amounts and consequently P loads. Runoff and P losses were dominated by snowmelt across all sites, however, regional differences in runoff amounts, and P concentrations, loads and speciation were apparent. Proportions of total P in the dissolved form were greater in the prairie region (55-94% in Manitoba) than in the Great Lakes region (26-35% in Ontario). In Manitoba, dissolved P concentrations in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff were strongly positively correlated to soil Olsen P concentrations in the 0-5 cm soil depth; however, this relationship was not found for Ontario fields, where tile drainage dominated hydrologic losses. Although precipitation amounts and runoff volumes were greater in Ontario than Manitoba, some of the greatest P loads were observed from Manitoba fields, driven by management practices. This synthesis highlights the differences across the Canadian agricultural regions in P runoff patterns and drivers, and suggests the need of co-ordinated and standardized monitoring programs to better understand regional differences and inform management.

However, there are considerable difficulties in the paleoenvironmental interpretation of LCAs from Group 2 Isochrysidales thriving in saline lakes. The biggest challenge lies in our poor understanding of the complexity and ecological niches of individual Group 2 subclades in saline lakes. Here, we perform comprehensive analysis of haptophyte-specific 18S rRNA sequences and distributions of LCAs, and long-chain alkenoates (LCEs) in surface sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) from 37 saline lakes in northern China. These lakes span a large salinity gradient from 0.5 to 308%. Combined with published genomic data of Group 2 Isochrysidales, our phylogenetic analysis reveals three Group 2 subclades occupying distinct ecological niches: one ice-related bloomer Group 2i and two warm-season bloomers Groups 2w1 and 2w2. Group 2i, the earliest seasonal bloomer, frequently co-occurs with Group 2w1 in sediments from saline lakes with relatively low to intermediate salinity waters, whereas Group 2w2 blooms in hypersaline waters. Based on existing data, C-39:4 methyl alkenone is a chemotaxonomic biomarker for Group 2i. %C-3(7:)4 (relative abundance of C(3)(7:)(4 )to the total C-37 alkenones) values in the three Group subclades follow the order: Group 2i > Group 2w2 > Group 2w1. The %C(37:4 )in sediment cores of saline lakes does not directly record past salinity changes, but instead reflects variable contributions in production by these three subclades. This could indirectly and partially reflect overall salinity changes in some lakes dominated by Groups 2i and 2w1, but can be more complicated in lakes dominated by other assemblages. For our sites, we also demonstrate that direct use of C(37 )alkenone unsaturation indices (U-37(K), U-37(K'), and U-37(K '')) for paleotemperature reconstructions in saline lakes is generally not feasible, except for cases where alkenone-producing Isochrysidales are dominated by one single species/subclade and seasonal production effects can be circumvented. We propose two possible alternative proxies for paleotemperature reconstructions in saline lakes: 1) unsaturation ratios of C-41 and C-42 alkenones, as these compounds are predominantly produced by a limited number of Group 2 species, such as Isochrysis nuda (Liao et al., 2020) 2) C38Et/C36OEt ratio (ratio of C-38 ethyl alkenones and C-36 ethyl alkenoates), which appears to have similar temperature sensitivity for Groups 2w1 and 2w2, in lakes with no Group 2i inputs. Our study provides new insights into the phylogenetic classifications of Group 2 Isochrysidales and their ecological/environmental niches, which are fundamental for more quantitative and rigorous applications of LCAs and LCEs in saline lakes as paleosalinity and paleotemperature proxies.

J	Guo, HW; Huang, JJ; Zhu, XT; Tian, S; Wang, BL				Guo, Hongwei; Huang, Jinhui Jeanne; Zhu, Xiaotong; Tian, Shang; Wang, Benlin			Spatiotemporal variation reconstruction of total phosphorus in the Great Lakes since 2002 using remote sensing and deep neural network	WATER RESEARCH												Total phosphorus (TP) is non-optically active, thus TP concentration (CTP) estimation using remote sensing still exists grand challenge. This study developed a deep neural network model (DNN) for CTP estimation with synchronous in-situ measurements and MODIS-derived remote sensing reflectance ( R rs ) ( N = 3916). Using DNN, the annual and intra-annual CTP spatial distributions of the Great Lakes since 2002 were reconstructed. Then, the reconstructions were correlated to nine potential factors, e.g., Chlorophyll-a, snowmelt, and cropland, to explain seasonal and long -term CTP variations. The results showed that DNN reliably estimated CTP from MODIS R rs , with R- 2 , mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) of 0.83, 1.05 mu g/L, 2.95 mu g/L, 9.92%, and 0.13 on the test set. The near-surface CTP in the Great Lakes decreased significantly ( p < 0.05) during 2002 - 2022, primarily attributed to cropland reduction, coupled with improvements in basin natural ecosystems. The sensitivity analysis verified the model robustness when confronted with input feature changes < 35%. This result along with the marginal difference between CTP derived from two sensors (R 2 = 0.76, MAE = 2.12 mu g/L, RMSE = 2.51 mu g/L, MAPE = 11.52%, RMSLE = 0.24) suggested the model transferability from MODIS to VIIRS. This transformation facilitated optimal usage of MODIS-related archive and enhanced the continuity of CTP estimation at moderate resolution. This study presents a practical method for spatiotemporal reconstruction of CTP using remote sensing, and contributes to better understandings of driving factors behind CTP variations in the Great Lakes.					; Benlin, Wang/KUD-6707-2024; Guo, Hongwei/HMD-6491-2023	WANG, BenLin/0000-0001-6677-3813; Tian, Shang/0009-0006-9663-4447; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAY 15	2024	255								121493	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121493		MAR 2024						38547788					WOS:001224807300001

In this study, climatic, terrestrial and anthropogenic effects that caused desiccation of the Urmia Lake, NW Iran are investigated. The main objective is to assess the influence of climatic and regional factors against anthropogenic and local ones in the dryness of the lake during the last two decades. Annual temperature, precipitation and wind speed data measured at nearby meteorological stations, along with water discharge of eight main rivers flowing into the lake are analyzed. The results reveal that the main cause for turning Urmia into a dried lake bed was human interference, since climatic factors contributed positively but to a lesser degree, while terrestrial factors may also play a crucial role. Among anthropogenic interferences, the construction of a causeway had a weak effect in the lake's dryness, while construction of many river dams highly contributed to this disaster. Furthermore, four machine learning models showed that groundwater decline is also an important factor for lake's desiccation. Analysis of dusty days at stations in the Urmia Basin showed similar inter-annual and seasonal dust variability over the whole western Iran. This indicates that dust over the Urmia Basin is mainly affected by the regional dust activity, while the dried lake beds contribute to a lesser degree to the enhanced dust loading. The dominant wind flow is mostly southwesterly, carrying Urmia saline dust toward NE directions, affecting Tabriz city. Three main synoptic clusters, with dipole features consisted of high-pressure systems over Europe, Central Mediterranean and North Africa and low pressure over SW Asia, facilitated strong westerly winds from arid, desert areas of the Middle East toward the Urmia Basin during 118 dust storms in the region.

J	Lenz, OK; Wilde, V; Mertz, DF; Riegel, W				Lenz, Olaf K.; Wilde, Volker; Mertz, Dieter F.; Riegel, Walter			New palynology-based astronomical and revised 40Ar/39Ar ages for the Eocene maar lake of Messel (Germany)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The annually laminated oil shale from the Eocene maar lake at Messel (Federal State of Hessen, Germany) provides unique paleoenvironmental data for a time interval of similar to 640 ka during the Paleogene greenhouse phase. As a consequence of orbitally controlled changes in the vegetation in the vicinity of the lake, the lacustrine laminites can now be astronomically tuned. Dating is based on the short eccentricity amplitude modulations of the regional pollen rain and their correlation to the astronomical La2010a/La2010d solutions in combination with a revised 40Ar/39Ar age of a basalt fragment from a lapilli tuff section below the first lacustrine sediments. Depending on different newly suggested ages for the Fish Canyon sanidine used as monitor for neutron irradiation, the age for the eruption at Messel is between 48.27 +/- A 0.22 and 48.11 +/- A 0.22 Ma. This allows for the first time the exact correlation of a Paleogene lacustrine sequence to the marine record in Central Europe. The Messel oil shale becomes now slightly older than previously assumed and includes the Ypresian/Lutetian boundary that moves the base of the European Land Mammal Age Geiseltalian (MP 11) into the Lower Eocene. This opens a window for establishing an independent chronostratigraphic framework for Paleogene terrestrial records and their correlation to the marine realm. Furthermore, the study reveals that higher amounts of pollen from "wet" and thermophilous plants indicate less seasonal and more balanced precipitation and slightly higher temperatures during a well-expressed eccentricity minimum.																			1437-3254	1437-3262				APR	2015	104	3					873	889		10.1007/s00531-014-1126-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-014-1126-2													WOS:000351519400020

An emerging public concern on lake eutrophication has heightened the need to assess and predict the trophic status in floodplain lakes, particularly for those with high spatial heterogeneity. In this study, combined multivariate statistical techniques and random forests model were used to characterize the water quality and trophic status of Poyang Lake. By classifying and characterizing seasonal water samples comprising 11 water quality parameters collected from 13 sampling sites in Poyang Lake between 2008 and 2014, the dataset was divided into the central and northern lake groups, which corresponded to lentic and lotic regions in Poyang Lake, respectively. The spatial water quality variations and underlying patterns were investigated by performing discriminant analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Lastly, random forests (RF) were used to predict the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) variations of the central and northern lakes. The PCA results indicated that the water quality of the central and northern areas of the lake was controlled by different environmental variables and underlying pollutant sources. The RF model outperformed the artificial neural network and linear regression and was robust with strong predictive capabilities. It was determined that the most important predictors of the Chl-a variations in the northern lake were water temperature (T) and water level, whereas transparency, T, and water level were the most efficient predictors in the central lake. The RF model can also be applied to trophic prediction in other large lakes with considerable spatial variations. This study will have implications on water quality management and eutrophication prevention in floodplain lakes with high spatial heterogeneity.

This study investigated the relationship between the composition of pelagic phytoplankton communities in these lakes and their trophic status, to assess how phytoplankton surveys with recognition of indicator species can assist in the assessment of water-resource vulnerability to human impact. For this purpose we analyzed 70 phytoplankton samples with linked environmental data from 26 crater lakes spanning the entire regional gradients of primary productivity and land-use intensity, with each lake sampled two to four times and during both dry and rainy seasons. At this equatorial location, nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass (measured as the concentration of chlorophyll-a) showed no consistent seasonal pattern. In total we recorded 118 phytoplankton taxa from 72 genera, and from 20 to 54 taxa per lake. The phytoplankton community of most lakes and in most seasons was dominated by cyanobacteria (on average 78% of total cell counts) followed by green algae (17%) and diatoms (4%); euglenophytes, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes and cryptophytes together contributed less than 1% on average. Many species were found to have a wide distribution along the productivity gradient, which complicated characterization of phytoplankton communities typical of different trophic states. Cluster analysis revealed four groups of samples, of which two broadly represented the least and most highly productive lakes. The two other groups comprised a mixture of lakes with intermediate productivity, suggesting that phytoplankton composition in these lakes is structured by other factors in addition to nutrient availability. In total 25 taxa displayed a significant association with one of these groups, but only 12 of them can be considered robust indicators of a particular trophic level; among these, the cyanobacteria Planktolyngbya limnetica and Microcystis aeruginosa qualify as strong indicator species for lakes with low and high productivity, respectively. Based on the distributional turnover between indicator species, we propose that the fresh Ugandan crater lakes comprise four trophic levels, of which the boundaries are situated higher up the chlorophyll-a gradient than those between the four classic trophic levels defined for temperate-region lakes. For practical use, Ugandan crater lakes with a chlorophyll-a concentration up to 6 mu g/L can be defined as oligotrophic; similarly, we situate the mesotrophic/eutrophic boundary at ca 20 mu g/L, and the eutrophic/hypertrophic boundary at ca 60 mu g/L.					; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020; Nankabirwa, Angela/LEL-7604-2024	Verschuren, Dirk/0000-0002-9116-5446; De Crop, Wannes/0000-0002-2726-5741; Nankabirwa, Angela/0000-0002-6827-8039; Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2019	107								105563	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105563													WOS:000490757500025

Multiscale drivers of restoration outcomes for an imperiled songbird	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Habitat restoration is a cornerstone of conservation, particularly for habitat-limited species. However, restoration efforts are seldom rigorously monitored at meaningful spatial scales. Poor understanding of how species respond to habitat restoration programs limits conservation efficacy for habitat-restricted species like the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera, GWWA). We provide one of the first concerted assessments of a national conservation program aimed at restoring songbird habitat across its breeding range. We studied GWWA response to forest habitat restoration across two broad regions with opposing population trajectories and assessed factors driving species use of restored habitats across multiple spatial scales. From 2015 to 2017, we conducted 1,145 (n = 457 locations) and 519 point counts (n = 215 locations) across the Appalachian Mountains and Great Lakes (respectively) within restored habitats. Warbler abundance within restored habitats across the Great Lakes varied with latitude, longitude, elevation, forest type, and number of growing seasons. In the Appalachian Mountains, occupancy (psi<^>) varied with longitude, elevation, forest type, and number of growing seasons. Detections were restricted to areas within close proximity to population centers (usually <24 km) in the Appalachian Mountains, where GWWAs are rare (psi<^> = 0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-0.25), but not in the Great Lakes, where GWWAs remain common (psi<^> = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.84-0.90). Our study suggests that, even when best management practices are carefully implemented, restoration outcomes vary within/across regions and with multiscale habitat attributes. Although assessments of concerted habitat restoration efforts remain uncommon, our study demonstrates the value of monitoring data in the adaptive management process for imperiled species.					; Rodewald, Amanda/I-6308-2016; Dhondt, André/A-8292-2008; Soto, Gerardo/JAX-4165-2023	McNeil, Darin/0000-0003-4595-8354; Rodewald, Amanda/0000-0002-6719-6306; Soto, Gerardo/0000-0002-9706-6588; 													1061-2971	1526-100X				JUL	2020	28	4					880	891		10.1111/rec.13147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13147		APR 2020											WOS:000522769200001

Dryland continental mudstones: Deciphering environmental changes in problematic mudstones from the Upper Triassic (Carnian to Norian) Mercia Mudstone Group, south-west Britain	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The sedimentology, petrography and mineralogy of the seemingly monotonous Late Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group across the Severn Basin and Bristol Channel region reveals a bipartite division of mudrock facies above and below the Arden Sandstone Formation. Frequently cryptic sedimentary and pedogenic features reveal diverse alluvial, aeolian, playa-lacustrine and pedogenic processes operating at different times, locations and scales probably in response to climate change. The current study found no evidence of significant marine influence in either of the two mudrock facies associations that are described here. Blocky claystones dominate the lower Mercia Mudstone Group (Sidmouth Mudstone Formation), with pedogenic features such as slickensides, mottling, tubules and carbonate/sulphate nodules common and widespread. The claystones are of alluvial/lacustrine origin with subordinate sheet sandstones, themselves overprinted by pedogenic features, reflecting occasional high intensity rainfall events. These facies reflect a seasonal (wet/dry) semi-arid climate favouring development of transformed/neoformed (smectite-rich) clay minerals of intrabasinal origin. Massive to weakly stratified silty mudstones dominate the upper Mercia Mudstone Group (Branscombe Mudstone Formation). Commonly conchoidally weathered, locally gypsiferous, but with distinct sedimentary structures scarce, they alternate with subordinate blue-grey laminated silty mudstones. Together they reflect fluctuating hydrological conditions within extensive saline mudflats and ephemeral playa lakes, with laminated facies deposited under subaqueous conditions during more humid phases whereas massive mudstones reflect modification through interstitial growth/dissolution of sulphates and deflation of surface sediments during drier episodes. These facies reflect increased aridity during deposition of the upper Mercia Mudstone Group compared with the lower Mercia Mudstone Group, favouring development of detrital/transformed (illite-chlorite) clay minerals of extrabasinal origin. The described facies associations and the sedimentary fabrics and structures that characterize them, occur widely in the Mercia Mudstone Group across the United Kingdom and comparable facies associations may be anticipated in other fine-grained red bed successions. Recognition of these facies may aid palaeoenvironmental interpretation of such sequences on Earth and, potentially, on Mars also.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				DEC	2019	66	7					2557	2589		10.1111/sed.12626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12626		AUG 2019											WOS:000480931700001

Potential changes to the biology and challenges to the management of invasive sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the Laurentian Great Lakes due to climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Control programs are implemented to mitigate the damage caused by invasive species worldwide. In the highly invaded Great Lakes, the climate is expected to become warmer with more extreme weather and variable precipitation, resulting in shorter iced-over periods and variable tributary flows as well as changes to pH and river hydrology and hydrogeomorphology. We review how climate change influences physiology, behavior, and demography of a damaging invasive species, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), in the Great Lakes, and the consequences for sea lamprey control efforts. Sea lamprey control relies on surveys to monitor abundance of larval sea lamprey in Great Lakes tributaries. The abundance of parasitic, juvenile sea lampreys in the lakes is calculated by surveying wounding rates on lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and trap surveys are used to enumerate adult spawning runs. Chemical control using lampricides (i.e., lamprey pesticides) to target larval sea lamprey and barriers to prevent adult lamprey from reaching spawning grounds are the most important tools used for sea lamprey population control. We describe how climate change could affect larval survival in rivers, growth and maturation in lakes, phenology and the spawning migration as adults return to rivers, and the overall abundance and distribution of sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Our review suggests that Great Lakes sea lamprey may benefit from climate change with longer growing seasons, more rapid growth, and greater access to spawning habitat, but uncertainties remain about the future availability and suitability of larval habitats. Consideration of the biology of invasive species and adaptation of the timing, intensity, and frequency of control efforts is critical to the management of biological invasions in a changing world, such as sea lamprey in the Great Lakes.					; Remucal, Christina K./B-8932-2009; Remucal, Christina/B-8932-2009; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Zielinski, Daniel/GPF-5806-2022; Lin, Hsien-Yung/H-2303-2013	Robinson, Kelly/0000-0001-8109-9492; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Remucal, Christina K./0000-0003-4285-7638; Muir, Andrew/0000-0003-2170-1263; Bravener, Gale/0000-0002-1497-1460; Lennox, Robert/0000-0003-1010-0577; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2020	26	3					1118	1137		10.1111/gcb.14957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14957		JAN 2020						31833135					WOS:000509609500001
J	Chi, DK; Wang, H; Li, XB; Liu, HH; Li, XH				Chi, Dengkai; Wang, Hong; Li, Xiaobing; Liu, Honghai; Li, Xiaohui			Estimation of the ecological water requirement for natural vegetation in the Ergune River basin in Northeastern China from 2001 to 2014	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Vegetation is the most basic component of a basin. The ecological water requirement (EWR) of vegetation consequently has a direct impact on the judicious allocation of water resources in basin. In this paper, we combined the Penman-Monteith method with GIS and remote sensing techniques to dynamically calculate the vegetation coefficient and introduced the soil moisture limitation coefficient, which together provides a complete and accurate approach in calculating the EWR of natural vegetation. We then calculated the EWR and the ecological water deficit (EWD) of vegetation in the Ergune River basin and analyzed spatiotemporal variations. (1) The four main vegetation types were coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, steppe, and meadow, which accounted for 87% of the basin's total area. EWR were 2.11 x 10(10) m(3), 0.76 x 10(10) m(3), 3.39 x 10(10) m(3), and 10(10) m(3), respectively. (2) Evapotranspiration from coniferous and broad-leaved forests decreased by 7.93 mm a(-1) and 6.88 mm a(-1) from 2001 to 2014, respectively, while herbaceous vegetation exhibited a slightly increasing trend. Total EWR of vegetation in the Ergune River Basin remained almost unchanged. (3) The water deficit of vegetation in the Ergune River basin was widely distributed. This was due to the semi-arid and cold conditions of the study area, where precipitation could not meet the EWR of vegetation. Water deficit stresses on vegetation were more prominent in the northern Hulun Lake, the eastern Hailar River, and the western mainstream section of the Ergune River, which could be alleviated by rainwater harvesting measures. (4) We determined that the distribution of EWR and the time allocation of precipitation in growth season were incongruous. Water deficit stresses were high in both the initial and developing stages, while it was relatively low in the latter stage. We found it was in the Hulun Lake System (sub-region of the Ergune River basin) that vegetation experienced a significant water deficit during all stages. We recommend to store rainwater by constructing water storage repositories for use in dry seasons.

J	Debanshi, S; Pal, S				Debanshi, Sandipta; Pal, Swades			Assessing the role of deltaic flood plain wetlands on regulating methane and carbon balance	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Present study deals with the role of wetland for regulating greenhouse gases (GHG) particularly methane (CH4) emission and carbon (C) sequestration in mature Ganges deltaic environment. The annual total amount of emission and sequestration in wetlands of varying types was estimated along with the seasonal variation. Result showed that the streams were the highest emitter of CH4 followed by ox-bow lakes in all the seasons whereas the bheries (embanked pisciculture arresting tidal water) consistently exhibited the lowest average emission. The average sequestration of C was the highest in ox-bow lakes followed by marshes and mudflats. The average emission in monsoon season was 43% and 78% higher than the average emission of pre and post-monsoon seasons respectively. The yearly total emission was 8.01 x 10(3) ton and yearly total sequestration was estimated 908.98 x 10(3) ton. From the perspective of GHG regulation, the wetlands were found to yearly uptake four times higher carbon dioxide (CO2) than the CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) of emitted CH4. After offsetting the fixation cost of emitted CH4, the yearly surplus sequestrated C in the wetlands of the entire region was worthy of 68.46 million US dollar (USD). So, wetland plays positive role for reducing greenhouse gas effect and associated temperature rise which is considered to be serious issue. Such result has made a good agreement on the debated issue of wetland CH4 emission and C sequestration and will encourage restoring wetland for even mediating GHG issue.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 20	2022	808								152133	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152133		DEC 2021						34863740					WOS:000740226100008

Characterising groundwater-surface water connectivity in the lower Gandak catchment, a barrage regulated biodiversity hotspot in the mid-Gangetic basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The alluvial aquifer system of the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) is one of the world's most important freshwater resources, sustaining humans and river ecosystems. Understanding groundwater recharge processes and connections to meteoric and surface water is necessary for effective water resource management for human and wider ecological requirements. Parts of the mid-Gangetic Basin, across eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, are characterised by stable long-term groundwater levels, high annual rainfall, and limited historical groundwater use compared to parts of Northwest India for example. In this paper we use a combination of environmental tracers and hydrograph observations to characterise sources of recharge and groundwater-surface water interaction using a transect approach across the catchment of the River Gandak, a major barrage-regulated tributary of the River Ganga. Stable isotope results show that the dominant source of groundwater recharge, in the shallow (0-40 m bgl) Holocene and underlying Pleistocene aquifer system (>40 m bgl), is local rainfall. The shallow Holocene aquifer is also supplemented by local recharge from river and canal seepage and irrigation return flow in the upper and mid parts of the catchment. These observations are corroborated by evidence from detailed groundwater hydrographs and salinity observations, indicating localised canal, river and lake connectivity to groundwater. In the middle and lower catchment, river discharge is dominated by groundwater baseflow during the peak dry season when barrage gates are closed, which contributes to ecological flows for endangered river dolphins and gharial crocodiles. Groundwater residence time tracers indicate active modern recharge in the shallow alluvial aquifer system across the catchment. In the shallow Holocene aquifer elevated arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) exceeded WHO drinking water guidelines in a minority of sites, and uranium (U) and fluoride (F) concentrations approach but do not exceed the WHO guideline values. These observations varied across the catchment with higher As, Fe and Mn in the upper and mid catchments and higher U in the lower catchment. Groundwater salinity was typically between 500 and 1000 mu S/cm, and isolated higher salinity was due to recharge from flood-plain wetlands and lakes impacted by evaporation. At present, the Gandak catchment has relatively high rainfall and low abstraction, which maintains stable groundwater levels and thus baseflow to the river in the dry season. Potential future threats to groundwater resources, and therefore river ecology due to the sensitivity to changes in baseflow in the catchment, would likely be driven by reductions in local monsoon rainfall, changes in water management practices and increased groundwater use.					krishan, gopal/IAM-2017-2023; MacDonald, Alan/A-8264-2013; Nair, Tarun/LDF-3808-2024	MacDonald, Alan/0000-0001-6636-1499; Krishnaswamy, Jagdish/0000-0001-7985-0005; O'Keeffe, Jimmy/0000-0002-6322-0305; Nair, Tarun/0000-0002-0521-6535; Jackson, Christopher/0000-0003-2373-2098													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2021	594								125923	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125923		JAN 2021											WOS:000641589600033

A two-year field experiment (2013-2014) was conducted in a rice field in southeastern China to evaluate the N losses in runoff resulting from four rice cultivation methods: (1) conventional, manually transplanted seedling rice (CTSR); (2) mechanically transplanted seedling rice (MTSR); (3) dry direct-seeded rice (DDSR); and (4) wet direct-seeded rice (WDSR). Runoff volumes; runoff concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3--N, and total N (TN); N uptake; and grain yield were measured. The seasonal runoff volumes varied from 775 to 2397 m(3) ha(-1) in 2013 and 2014. Compared with CTSR, WDSR and DDSR significantly increased the total runoff volumes by 76% and 30% in 2013, and by 46% and 26% in 2014, respectively. The seasonal TN losses in runoff from the rice fields ranged from 1.99 to 10.18 kg N ha(-1), accounting for 0.74-3.77% of the seasonal N input during the two years. In contrast with CTSR, WDSR increased TN losses by 169% in 2013 and by 143% in 2014, while DDSR increased TN losses by 31% in 2013 and by 84% in 2014. Direct-seeded rice significantly increased runoff N losses during the early growth period largely by increasing runoff volumes and/or the N concentrations in runoff water. The main forms of N lost in runoff were NH4+-N for CTSR, MTSR and WDSR and NO3--N for DDSR. The grain yield, N uptake at mid-tillering and panicle initiation stages were similar in WDSR and DDSR and significantly lower than those under CTSR and MTSR. The results show that direct-seeded rice increased N runoff losses from intensively cultivated rice fields in southeastern China.

J	Lee, CS; Kim, M; Lee, C; Yu, Z; Lee, J				Lee, Chang Soo; Kim, Minseok; Lee, Cheonghoon; Yu, Zhnogtang; Lee, Jiyoung			The Microbiota of Recreational Freshwaters and the Implications for Environmental and Public Health	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The microbial communities in recreational freshwaters play important roles in both environmental and public health perspectives. In this study, the bacterial community structure and its associations with freshwater environments were investigated by analyzing the summertime microbiomes of three beach waters in Ohio (East Fork, Delaware, and Madison lakes) together with environmental and microbial water quality parameters. From the swimming season of 2009, 21 water samples were collected from the three freshwater beaches. From the samples, 110,000 quality-checked bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and analyzed, resulting in an observation of 4500 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most abundant bacteria were Mycobacterium and Arthrobacter of the Actinobacteria (33.2%), Exiguobacterium and Paenisporosarcina of the Firmicutes (23.4%), Planktothrix and Synechococcus of the Cyanobacteria (20.8%), and Methylocystis and Polynucleobacter of the Proteobacteria (16.3%). Considerable spatial and temporal variations were observed in the bacterial community of Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes, where the bacterial community structure was greatly influenced by hydrological and weather conditions. The most influential factors were (1) water inflow for Bacteroidia and Clostridia, (2) turbidity for Gammaproteobacteria, (3) precipitation for Bacilli, and (4) temperature and pH for Cyanobacteria. One noticeable microbial interaction in the bacterial community was a significant negative relationship between Cyanobacteria and Bacilli (P < 0.05). Concerning beach water quality, the level of the genetic markers for cyanobacterial toxin (mcyA) was linked to the abundance of Cyanobacteria. In addition, unique distributions of the genera Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Finegoldia, Burkholderia, and Klebsiella, together with a high density of fecal indicator Escherichia coli, were markedly observed in the sample from Madison Lake on July 13, suggesting a distinctly different source of bacterial loading into the lake, possibly fecal contamination. In conclusion, deep sequencing-based microbial community analysis can provide detailed profiles of bacterial communities and information on potential public health risks at freshwater beaches.

L.; Barnes, Clair; Temple, Lucy; Akurut, Mary; Bally, Philippe; van Lipzig, Nicole P. M.; Thiery, Wim			Possible role of anthropogenic climate change in the record-breaking 2020 Lake Victoria levels and floods	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS												Heavy rainfall in eastern Africa between late 2019 and mid 2020 caused devastating floods and landslides throughout the region. These rains drove the levels of Lake Victoria to a record-breaking maximum in the second half of May 2020. The combination of high lake levels, consequent shoreline flooding, and flooding of tributary rivers caused hundreds of casualties and damage to housing, agriculture, and infrastructure in the riparian countries of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. Media and government reports linked the heavy precipitation and floods to anthropogenic climate change, but a formal scientific attribution study has not been carried out so far. In this study, we characterize the spatial extent and impacts of the floods in the Lake Victoria basin and then investigate to what extent human-induced climate change influenced the probability and magnitude of the record-breaking lake levels and associated flooding by applying a multi-model extreme event attribution methodology. Using remote-sensing-based flood mapping tools, we find that more than 29 000 people living within a 50 km radius of the lake shorelines were affected by floods between April and July 2020. Precipitation in the basin was the highest recorded in at least 3 decades, causing lake levels to rise by 1.21 m between late 2019 and mid 2020. The flood, defined as a 6-month rise in lake levels as extreme as that observed in the lead-up to May 2020, is estimated to be a 63-year event in the current climate. Based on observations and climate model simulations, the best estimate is that the event has become more likely by a factor of 1.8 in the current climate compared to a pre-industrial climate and that in the absence of anthropogenic climate change an event with the same return period would have led lake levels to rise by 7 cm less than observed. Nonetheless, uncertainties in the attribution statement are relatively large due to large natural variability and include the possibility of no observed attributable change in the probability of the event (probability ratio, 95 % confidence interval 0.8-15.8) or in the magnitude of lake level rise during an event with the same return period (magnitude change, 95 % confidence interval 0-14 cm). In addition to anthropogenic climate change, other possible drivers of the floods and their impacts include human land and water management, the exposure and vulnerability of settlements and economic activities located in flood-prone areas, and modes of climate variability that modulate seasonal precipitation. The attribution statement could be strengthened by using a larger number of climate model simulations, as well as by quantitatively accounting for non-meteorological drivers of the flood and potential unforced modes of climate variability. By disentangling the role of anthropogenic climate change and natural variability in the high-impact 2020 floods in the Lake Victoria basin, this paper contributes to a better understanding of changing hydrometeorological extremes in eastern Africa and the African Great Lakes region.					; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021; Vanderkelen, Inne/GQI-4342-2022; van Lipzig, Nicole/ABF-2964-2021; Pietroiusti, Rosa/NES-8254-2025	Vanderkelen, Inne/0000-0002-8673-1933; van Lipzig, Nicole/0000-0003-2899-4046; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; Pietroiusti, Rosa/0000-0002-6815-5231; Temple, Lucy/0009-0008-5955-942X													2190-4979	2190-4987				MAR 18	2024	15	2					225	264		10.5194/esd-15-225-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-225-2024													WOS:001191882900001

From water to edible fish. Transfer of metals and metalloids in the San Roque Reservoir (Cordoba, Argentina). Implications associated with fish consumption	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The concentration of Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Ag, Mo, Nd, Al, Ce, As, Sr, Pb, Pt and Hg was analysed in water, sediments, and aquatic organisms from the San Roque Reservoir (Cordoba-Argentina), sampled during the wet and dry season, to evaluate their transfer through the food web. Stable nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes were used to investigate trophic interactions. According to this, samples were divided into three trophic groups: plankton, shrimp (Palaemonetes argentinus) and fish (Silverside, Odontesthes bonariensis). Liver and gills are the main heavy metal storage tissues in fish. Hg and As concentrations in the muscle of O. bonariensis exceed the Oral Reference doses for metals established by USEPA (2009). Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) for each element were determined from the slope of the regression between trace element concentrations and delta N-15. Calculated TMFs showed fundamental differences in the trophodynamics of the studied elements during the wet and dry season in the San Roque Reservoir. Concentrations of Ni, Cd, Cr, Al, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ce, Nd, Pt and Pb during both seasons, and Sr during the dry season, showed statistically significant decreases (TMF<1) with increasing trophic levels. Thus these elements were trophically diluted in the San Roque food chain. Conversely, Cu, Ag and As (dry season) showed no significant relationships with trophic levels. Among the elements studied, Hg in the wet season, and Zn in the dry season were the only ones showing a statistically significant increase (TMF>1) in concentration with trophic level. Current results trigger the need for further studies to establish differential behaviour with different species within the aquatic web, particularly when evaluating the transfer of toxic elements to edible organisms, which could pose health risks to humans.

J	Rabaey, J; Cotner, J				Rabaey, Joseph; Cotner, James			Pond greenhouse gas emissions controlled by duckweed coverage	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Freshwaters are significant contributors of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Small waterbodies such as ponds are now recognized to have disproportionate greenhouse gas emissions relative to their size, but measured emissions from ponds have varied by several orders of magnitude. To assess drivers of variation in pond greenhouse gas dynamics, we measured concentrations and emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O across 26 ponds in Minnesota, United States, during the ice-free season. The studied ponds differed in land-use, from urban stormwater ponds to natural forested ponds. The ponds were all sources of greenhouse gases, driven by large CH4 emissions (mean 704 [sd 840] mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1)). CO2 fluxes were variable, but on average a sink (mean -25.9 [sd 862] mg CO2-C m(-2) d(-1)), and N2O emissions were generally low (mean 0.398 [sd 0.747] mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)). Duckweed coverage on the water surfaces ranged from 0% to 100% coverage, and had the largest influence on water chemistry and greenhouse gas dynamics across the ponds. Duckweed covered ponds (ponds with greater than 85% coverage) had higher phosphorus levels and increased anoxia compared to ponds without duckweed (ponds with less than 12% coverage), leading to higher CH4 concentrations and overall greenhouse gas emissions in the duckweed ponds. Duckweed ponds had a mean emission rate in CO2 equivalents of 30.9 g C m(-2) d(-1) compared to 11.0 g C m(-2) d(-1) in non-duckweed ponds.

J	Eckley, CS; Luxton, TP; Goetz, J; McKernan, J				Eckley, Chris S.; Luxton, Todd P.; Goetz, Jennifer; McKernan, John			Water-level fluctuations influence sediment porewater chemistry and methylmercury production in a flood-control reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Reservoirs typically have elevated fish mercury (Hg) levels compared to natural lakes and rivers. A unique feature of reservoirs is water-level management which can result in sediment exposure to the air. The objective of this study is to identify how reservoir water-level fluctuations impact Hg cycling, particularly the formation of the more toxic and bioaccumulative methylmercury (MeHg). Total-Hg (THg), MeHg, stable isotope methylation rates and several ancillary parameters were measured in reservoir sediments (including some in porewater and overlying water) that are seasonally and permanently inundated. The results showed that sediment and porewater MeHg concentrations were over 3-times higher in areas experiencing water-level fluctuations compared to permanently inundated sediments. Analysis of the data suggest that the enhanced breakdown of organic matter in sediments experiencing water-level fluctuations has a two-fold effect on stimulating Hg methylation: 1) it increases the partitioning of inorganic Hg from the solid phase into the porewater phase (lower log K-d values) where it is more bioavailable for methylation; and 2) it increases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the porewater which can stimulate the microbial community that can methylate Hg. Sulfate concentrations and cycling were enhanced in the seasonally inundated sediments and may have also contributed to increased MeHg production. Overall, our results suggest that reservoir management actions can have an impact on the sediment-porewater characteristics that affect MeHg production. Such findings are also relevant to natural water systems that experience wetting and drying cycles, such as floodplains and ombrotrophic wetlands.					; Luxton, todd/AAA-7671-2020	McKernan, John/0000-0003-2247-447X; Luxton, Todd/0000-0003-1774-5407; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				MAR	2017	222						32	41		10.1016/j.envpol.2017.01.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.01.010								28104341					WOS:000395360900004

Current chemical composition of Lake Baikal water	INLAND WATERS					6th International Vereshchagin Baikal Conference	SEP, 2015	Inst Limnol, Irkutsk, RUSSIA		Inst Limnol			Habitats of organisms in Lake Baikal have been comprehensively monitored for many years. In 2010-2015, we conducted 8 research expeditions to study ionic composition of the water and measure concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nutrients, organic carbon, and persistent organic pollutants in the entire pelagic area of Lake Baikal. Our data showed that the ionic composition was stable at all depths in the pelagic zone of the lake. We also recorded seasonal variability, vertical stratification, and spatial variations in the content of nutrients, organic matter, and gas components. The concentrations of major ions, nutrients, and dissolved oxygen were favourable for the growth of hydrobionts in the offshore pelagic zone. Concentrations of pollutants in Lake Baikal, such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, were low and did not directly affect the biota. The water in specific areas of the littoral zone of Lake Baikal, however, was polluted near large settlements (Listvyanka, Severobaikalsk, Baikalsk, and Slyudyanka) and in bays because of unsatisfactory operations of sewage treatment plants, growing tourist activity, and intense ship traffic. Continuing investigations are needed to elucidate causes of eutrophication in the littoral zone of Lake Baikal.					; Sakirko, Mariya/J-3467-2018; Tomberg, Irina/K-6819-2018; Domysheva, Valentina/HKO-1427-2023	Tomberg, Irina/0000-0001-5415-9867; Sakirko, Mariya/0000-0002-5492-7296; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	3					250	258		10.1080/20442041.2017.1329982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1329982													WOS:000412646100002

Forecast models are used annually to predict bloom intensity for the whole Western lake Erie Basin, but do not necessarily reflect nearshore conditions or regional variations, which are important for local stakeholders. In this study we: 1) developed relationships between observed whole basin and nearshore bloom sizes, and 2) updated and extended a Bayesian seasonal bloom forecast model to provide new regional predictions. The western basin was subdivided into 5 km near-shore regions, and bloom start date, size, and intensity were quantified with MODIS-derived images of chlorophyll concentrations for July-October 2002-2016 for each subdivision and for the entire basin. While bloom severity within each subdivision is temporally and spatially unique, it increased over the study period in each subdivision. The models for the 5 km subdivisions explained between 83 and 95% of variability between regional sizes and whole bloom size for US subdivisions and 51% for the Canadian subdivision. By linking predictive basin-wide models to regional regression estimates, we are now able to better predict potential bloom impacts at scales and in specific areas that are vital to the economic well-being of the region and allow for better management responses.

The effect of single versus dual nutrient decreases on phytoplankton growth rates, community composition, and Microcystin concentration in the western basin of Lake Erie	HARMFUL ALGAE												The primary management strategy for minimizing harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Lake Erie has been to reduce springtime loading of phosphorus (P) to the lake. However, some studies have shown that the growth rate and toxin content for the HABs-causing cyanobacterium Microcystis also respond to the availability of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N). This evidence is based on both observational studies that correlate bloom development with changes in N forms and concentrations in the lake, and experiments in which P and/or N are added at concentrations in excess of those present in the lake. The goal of this study was to determine whether a combined decrease in N and P concentrations from ambient levels in Lake Erie could limit the development of HABs more than a reduction in P concentration only. To directly test the impact of P-only versus dual N and P concentration decreases on phytoplankton in the western basin of Lake Erie, we evaluated changes in growth rate, community composition, and microcystin (MC) concentration through eight bioassay experiments performed from June through October 2018, which encompassed the normal Lake Erie Microcystis-dominated HAB season. Our results showed that during the first five experiments covering June 25 to August 13, the P-only and the dual N and P decrease treatments had similar effects. However, when ambient N became scarce later in the season, the N and P decrease treatments resulted in negative growth rates for cyanobacteria, whereas -P only decreases did not. During low ambient N conditions, dual nutrient decreases lowered the prevalence of cyanobacteria among the total phytoplankton community and decreased microcystin concentrations. The results presented here complement previous experimental work on Lake Erie and suggest that dual nutrient control could be an effective management strategy to decrease microcystin production during the bloom and even possibly diminish or shorten the duration of the bloom based on creating nutrient limiting conditions sooner in the HAB growing season.

Niger River, the most valued river in Nigeria, is under serious anthropogenic perturbations with no measures to save the river by concerned authorities. Samplings were conducted at 12 designated stations of the lower reaches of the river within the southern region of Nigeria. The elements (As, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg) were analysed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The average levels of As, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg in the river sediments were 12, 115, 18, 11, 0.71, 36 and 0.59 mg/kg, respectively. Certain indices, including the enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (I (geo)), pollution load index (PLI) and contamination factor (CF), were used to assess the ecological risk posed by metals in sediment. Cadmium in five locations (SP4- SP8) and Hg for sites SP4 and SP5, had their I (geo) values above 1.0, which implies that these stations were moderately polluted. The EF values for Cd, Hg and As were above 1.5 (EF > 1.5) in sites SP4 and SP5 especially in the dry season, indicating strong enrichment of these elements in sediment to anthropogenic influences. Potential ecological risks of heavy metals in sediment showed weak to very high threat which implies that the condition is much frightening to the biota and inhabitants in the vicinity of the river as well.

Archaeological excavations at Al Khiday (16-D-4 site, Khartoum, Sudan) revealed a multi-stratified cemetery with distinct burial phases, chronologically attributed to different periods spanning from the Early Holocene to the beginning of the 1st millennium CE. ATR-FTIR measurements are carried out on a set of 56 bone samples, representative of each burial phase. Parameters related to collagen content and to bioapatite crystallinity and structural carbonate are calculated from infrared spectra in order to monitor the types and extent of diagenetic alteration, to assess the preservation state of bones and to define the alteration processes occurring during burial. A new method is here developed to quantify the amount of secondary calcite and to remove its contribution to the infrared spectrum, when interfering with the signal of structural carbonate from bioapatite. Considering the wide span of time covered by the archaeological record, the variability of bones alteration among burial phases is related to the climatic changes occurring in central Sudan during the Holocene. The more humid environment occurring in the Early Holocene, characterised by higher precipitation rates, seasonal swamps and palaeo-lakes, progressively changed towards drier conditions until the current arid climate of the Sub-Saharan belt. The change of palaeoenvironmental and local burial conditions over time differently influenced the types and extent of diagenetic processes affecting bones during burial. In this research are also discussed advantages and disadvantages of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with respect to the more established FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Microplastics in Namibian river sediments - a first evaluation	MICROPLASTICS AND NANOPLASTICS												The African continent is rarely the focus of microplastics research, although the ubiquity of microplastics in the environment is undisputed and still increasing. Due to the high production and use of plastic products and the partial lack of recycling systems in many parts of the African continent, it can be assumed that microplastic particles are already present in limnic and terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies, mainly from South Africa and the Northern African region, show a contamination with microplastics, especially in marine environments. This study aims to explore the presence and composition of microplastics in fluvial sediments of the major catchments in Namibia with a regional focus on the Iishana system in Northern Namibia, as one of the most densely populated areas in the country. In March 2019 and March 2021, at the end of the rainy seasons, sediments from the Iishana system and of the largest river catchments were sampled. Extraction was performed by density separation using the Microplastic Sediment Separator (MPSS) with the separation solution sodium chloride (density of 1.20 g/cm3). The particle size was determined by filtration and fractionation, and the polymer type by measurement with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (minimum particle size 0.3 mm). Microplastics were found in the sediments of each river system, most of the particles in the Iishana system (average of 13.2 particles/kg dry weight). The perennial, the ephemeral rivers, and the Iishana system are similar concerning polymer type and particle size. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types. Most of the particles were found in the size fractions 0.3 - 0.5 mm and 0.5 - 1.0 mm. The particles were found mainly as fragments and films, the majority transparent and brown.

However, how WLF shapes the material cycling and concomitant trophodynamics of RCL remain unclear. Here we evaluated the resource availability, relative contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources (by Bayesian mixing models) and trophic structure (using delta 13C and delta 15N) of Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China, during different hydrological periods. Terrestrial C3 plants in the aquatic/terrestrial transition zones (ATTZ) were the main supporter of aquatic consumers all year round. Compared with historical data, the contributions of autochthonous production to aquatic food webs were low. This is primarily ascribed to the influences of hydrological regimes in that the operation of Three Gorges Dam and HC changed the rhythm of WLF in Lake Poyang, restricting the production of aquatic vegetation and epiphytic algae. Most common fish species indicated higher trophic positions (TPs) during the dry than wet season, but only eleven of thirty-six common species showed a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05). Our study reveals a relatively consistent trophic diversity of consumer communities (fish and aquatic invertebrates) during dry and wet seasons, but each trophic guild showed specific trophic response to WLF, as they flexibly adjusted feeding strategies and the degree of trophic niche differentiation. Although WLF triggered fluctuations in the resource availability and species composition of lake food webs, and the TPs and trophic niches of aquatic consumers during different hydrological periods, the resource diversity and habitat complexity driven by HC and WLF reduced the strength of trophic interactions, and thus resulted in overall stability of food web trophodynamics and trophic structure of Lake Poyang. Our findings highlighted the importance of HC and natural WLFs in maintaining the ecosystem stability of large floodplain lakes, and that seasonal WLF patterns should be maintained in future floodplain lake management to conserve biodiversity and the resilience of ecological functions.					; yao, na/HDL-8772-2022; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	Zhang, Xiumei/0000-0002-3168-7971; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2023	153								110372	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110372		MAY 2023											WOS:001010265800001

Eutrophication control for Lake Dianchi began in the mid-1980s. However, decision makers have been puzzled by the lack of visible water quality response to past efforts given the tremendous investment. Therefore, decision makers desperately need a scientifically sound way to quantitatively evaluate the response of lake water quality to proposed management measures and engineering works. We used a water quality modeling based scenario analysis approach to quantitatively evaluate the eutrophication responses of Lake Dianchi to an under-construction water diversion project. The primary analytic framework was built on a three-dimensional hydrodynamic, nutrient fate and transport, as well as algae dynamics model, which has previously been calibrated and validated using historical data. We designed 16 scenarios to analyze the water quality effects of three driving forces, including watershed nutrient loading, variations in diverted inflow water, and lake water level. A two-step statistical analysis consisting of an orthogonal test analysis and linear regression was then conducted to distinguish the contributions of various driving forces to lake water quality. The analysis results show that (a) the different ways of managing the diversion projects would result in different water quality response in Lake Dianchi, though the differences do not appear to be significant; (b) the maximum reduction in annual average and peak Chl-a concentration from the various ways of diversion project operation are respectively 11% and 5%; (c) a combined 66% watershed load reduction and water diversion can eliminate the lake hypoxia volume percentage from the existing 6.82% to 3.00%; and (d) the water diversion will decrease the occurrence of algal blooms, and the effect of algae reduction can be enhanced if diverted water are seasonally allocated such that wet season has more flows.

J	Pueppke, SG; Nurtazin, S; Ou, WX				Pueppke, Steven G.; Nurtazin, Sabir; Ou, Weixin			Water and Land as Shared Resources for Agriculture and Aquaculture: Insights from Asia	WATER												Although agriculture and aquaculture depend on access to increasingly scarce, shared water resources to produce food for human consumption, they are most often considered in isolation. We argue that they should be treated as integrated components of a single complex system that is prone to direct or indirect tradeoffs that should be avoided while also being amenable to synergies that should be sought. Direct tradeoffs such as competition for space or the pollution of shared water resources usually occur when the footprints of agriculture and aquaculture overlap or when the two practices coexist in close proximity to one another. Interactions can be modulated by factors such as hydropower infrastructure and short-term economic incentives, both of which are known to disrupt the balance between aquaculture and agriculture. Indirect tradeoffs, on the other hand, play out across distances, i.e., when agricultural food sources are diverted to feed animals in aquaculture. Synergies are associated with the culture of aquatic organisms in rice paddies and irrigation waters, seasonal rotations of crop cultivation with aquaculture, and various forms of integrated agriculture-aquaculture (IAA), including jitang, a highly developed variant of pond-dike IAA. Policy decisions, socioeconomic considerations, and technology warrant increased scrutiny as determinants of tradeoffs and synergies. Priority issues for the future include guiding the expansion of aquaculture from its traditional base in Asia, taking advantage of the heterogeneity that exists within both agricultural and aquaculture systems, the development of additional metrics of tradeoffs and synergies, and adapting to the effects of climate change.

Seasonal and abrupt changes in the water level of closed lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and implications for climate impacts	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Using ICESat laser altimetry data, we examine seasonal and abrupt changes in the water level of 105 closed lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2003 to 2009. The cluster analysis method is applied to categorize different temporal evolution patterns of lake level, and the links between abrupt lake-level variations of the different clusters in specific seasons and key climatic variables during 2003-2009 based on 12 weather stations are further analyzed. The results show that seasonal lake-level variations were featured by strong spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Most lakes, especially in south Tibet, the central and northeastern Tibetan Plateau, showed large water-level increases (0.307 +/- 0.301 m/year) in warm seasons (March-October), while showed declines or minor fluctuations (-0.091 +/- 0.202 m/year) in cold seasons (November-February). Many small lakes in the Changtang Plateau and northern TP showed negative water budgets in warm seasons due to low precipitation and strong evaporation, but positive water budgets depending on seasonal snow meltwater supply in cold seasons. These lakes can be partitioned into eight clusters according to the common characteristics of seasonal and consistent abrupt lake-level variations. Lakes of Clusters 4 and 5 are not analyzed in detail because of their scattered distributions. The abrupt lake-level rises or declines for Clusters 1, 2, 3, 7 were inferred to be closely associated with dramatic changes in precipitation and evaporation. For example, most lakes in Cluster 1 experienced the substantial water-level rises (similar to 0.99 m on average) in the warm season of 2005, which were largely attributable to the high precipitation and low evaporation in this season. The abrupt changes of water level for lakes in Clusters 6 and 8 (in the Changtang Plateau and northern TP) were probably associated with more snow meltwater supply. Time series of GRACE-observed terrestrial water storage changes confirm that the abrupt lake-level changes in specific seasons are associated with abnormal hydro-climatological conditions. Besides, the limitations of spatial pattern analysis of lake variations classification based on cluster analysis and the possible primary causes of lake level fluctuations are discussed.

Carbon emission from thermokarst lakes inNEEuropean tundra	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from inland waters is recognized as highly important and an understudied part of the terrestrial carbon (C) biogeochemical cycle. These emissions are still poorly quantified in subarctic regions that contain vast amounts of surface C in permafrost peatlands. This is especially true in NE European peatlands, located within sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zones which are highly vulnerable to thaw. Initial measurements of C emissions from lentic waters of the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra (BZT; 200,000 km(2)) demonstrated sizable CO(2)and CH(4)concentrations and fluxes to the atmosphere in 98 depressions, thaw ponds, and thermokarst lakes ranging from 0.5 x 10(6)to 5 x 10(6) m(2)in size. CO(2)fluxes decreased by an order of magnitude as waterbody size increased by > 3 orders of magnitude while CH(4)fluxes showed large variability unrelated to lake size. By using a combination of Landsat-8 and GeoEye-1 images, we determined lakes cover 4% of BZT and thus calculated overall C emissions from lentic waters to be 3.8 +/- 0.65 Tg C yr(-1)(99% C-CO2, 1% C-CH4), which is two times higher than the lateral riverine export. Large lakes dominated GHG emissions whereas small thaw ponds had a minor contribution to overall water surface area and GHG emissions. These data suggest that, if permafrost thaw in NE Europe results in disappearance of large thermokarst lakes and formation of new small thaw ponds and depressions, GHG emissions from lentic waters in this region may decrease.

J	Armon, M; Morin, E; Enzel, Y				Armon, Moshe; Morin, Efrat; Enzel, Yehouda			Overview of modern atmospheric patterns controlling rainfall and floods into the Dead Sea: Implications for the lake's sedimentology and paleohydrology	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Dead Sea sedimentary fill is the basis for interpreting limnological conditions and regional paleohydrology. Such interpretations require an understanding of present-day hydroclimatology to reveal the relative impact of different atmospheric circulation patterns on water and sediment delivery to the Dead Sea. Here we address the most important meteorological conditions governing regional and local rainstorm occurrences, with different discharge characteristics. These meteorological controls over the Dead Sea watershed offer insights into past hydrometeorological processes that could have governed the Dead Sea water budget, seasonal and annual flows, floods, and the resultant sedimentology. Rainfall is typically associated with synoptic-scale circulation patterns forced by an upper-level trough that include Mediterranean cyclones (MCs), active Red Sea troughs (ARSTs), and active subtropical jets (STJs), although other rainstorms and sub-synoptic processes also affect the region. We point to their relative importance in inflow volume, peak discharges, and delivery of sediments from the various environments of the basin. MCs control the annual water amount discharging into the Dead Sea. A change in their frequency, intensity, or latitude can substantially alter the lake water balance. A change in frequency or intensity of ARSTs and STJs affects extreme flood and sediment discharge. Floods reach the lake through (a) the Mediterranean-climate-controlled Lower Jordan River, (b) desert-climate-controlled Nahal HaArava, and (c) the arid wadies draining directly into the Dead Sea, some with wetter headwaters. Floods in the wetter parts of the watershed are mainly controlled by MCs, and characterized by larger frequency, volume, and duration, but lower peak discharges and possibly sediment delivery, than floods in the desert parts, which can be produced by the three synoptic types. ARSTs contribute to heavy rainfall, typically of a spotty nature, in the desert parts of the watershed. STJs are currently rare, but their rainfall accumulation may be greater than the annual mean over a broad area in the southern dry Dead Sea watershed. This article presents a review of recent studies, which is extended with new analyses of meteorological, rainfall and flood data, underlining the importance of the Lower Jordan River in supplying water volume to the Dead Sea, as compared to the high-discharge, low-volume floods of the arid part of the watershed.

Basin scale controls on CO2 and CH4 emissions from the Upper Mississippi River	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Upper Mississippi River, engineered for river navigation in the 1930s, includes a series of low-head dams and navigation pools receiving elevated sediment and nutrient loads from the mostly agricultural basin. Using high-resolution, spatially resolved water quality sensor measurements along 1385 river kilometers, we show that primary productivity and organic matter accumulation affect river carbon dioxide and methane emissions to the atmosphere. Phytoplankton drive CO2 to near or below atmospheric equilibrium during the growing season, while anaerobic carbon oxidation supports a large proportion of the CO2 and CH4 production. Reductions of suspended sediment load, absent of dramatic reductions in nutrients, will likely further reduce net CO2 emissions from the river. Large river pools, like Lake Pepin, which removes the majority of upstream sediments, and large agricultural tributaries downstream that deliver significant quantities of sediments and nutrients, are likely to persist as major geographical drivers of greenhouse gas emissions.

Study focus: This study improved the streamflow simulation by coupling hydrological and hydrodynamic models and considering water yields in data-scarce areas. We constructed a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) hydrological model of the Dongting Lake Basin to simulate the streamflow in the data-scarce areas, which was further coupled into the MIKE21 hydrodynamic model as additional boundary conditions. New hydrological insights: The results showed that the relative error of streamflow simulation was reduced from 24.64 % to 10.50 % in the coupled hydrological-hydraulic model over the singular hydrodynamic model, which also indirectly verified the results of streamflow simulation in the data-scarce area. Based on the coupled model, the annual water yields in the data-scarce areas were estimated to be 38.95 x 109 m3, representing 15.13 % of the yearly water yields in the basin. The water yields in the data-scarce areas showed a seasonal variation, which was concentrated from April to July. The monthly water balance error of the Dongting Lake Basin was significantly reduced (57.42 %) when considering the water yields in data-scarce areas. The model-coupling approach in this study can be applied to other data-scarce areas to improve streamflow simulation.

It has undergone a reduction in size, incorporation of wastewater, and short-term desiccation, and includes temporary wetlands interconnected during the rainy season, some of which receive treated wastewater. Sediments contain metals, thus affecting water quality. Five artificial lakes were studied, and 12 metals (As, Ba, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were monitored bimonthly in water and sediments from June 2015 to March 2018. The Metal Pollution Index (MPI) and the Distribution Coefficient (Kd) were computed. Fe and Cd were the most and least stable metals in sediments, respectively (mean Log(Kd) = 4.24 and 2.079). Based on Log(K-d), metals were ranked as Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Mg > Cr > Ni > Ba > Pb > Hg > As > Cd. Log(K-d) values < 3 and > 5 indicate that metals occur mainly in water and sediments, respectively. The Mean Distribution Coefficient Log(K-d MPI) is a novel index proposed to assess ecological risk from metals in a water body. This index allows determining the phase (liquid or solid) where metals predominate, negatively affecting either free-swimming or benthic organisms. Log(K-d MPI) values indicated that metals occur primarily in the liquid phase in all lakes studied.

In this study we analyzed the dynamic of the phytoplankton alpha diversity indices and their relationships with trophic state in two hydrologically connected aquatic habitats (Jinhewan Wetland and Harbin Section of the Songhua River) in the Songhua River Basin in northeast China. We hypothesized that the phytoplankton alpha-diversity indices have the potential to provide a signal linking trophic state variation in hydrologically connected aquatic habitats. Our results showed the Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta were abundant at most stations. T-test showed that phytoplankton alpha diversity indices varied significantly between rainy season and dry season. Trophic State Index recorded that a meso-trophic to eutrophic states of two connected habits during study period. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the dynamic of phytoplankton alpha diversity index was closely associated with trophic states change. Our result indicated that hydrological connectivity is a key factor influenced phytoplankton community assembly. In addition, it is beneficial to develop an integrated approach to appropriately describe and measure the trophic state variations of hydrologically connected aquatic habits in freshwater ecosystem.

In the period 2001-2015, we analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of the considered pollutants to detect potential contamination sources and to compare concentrations with Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) or existing Quality Standards (QSs). DDx and Hg contamination deriving from past industrial activities in the Pallanza Basin still exceeded SQGs in sediments and QSs in fish, with potential risks for the ecosystem. Banned in Europe in 1985, PCBs showed low residual values, while recent PBDE peaks resulted in the exceedance of the QSs for biota in both lakes, probably due to current industrial activities. Arsenic mainly derives from geochemical origin. The analysis of the biomagnification of toxicants in a pelagic food chain in Lake Maggiore (zooplankton-fish) according to a stable isotope approach is also presented, according to both the Trophic Magnification Factor and the Trophic Level-adjusted BioMagnification Factor: the importance of seasonality and a Hg>DDx approximate to PBDEs biomagnification capacity were observed. Low PCB bioaccumulation was detected in biota, probably because equilibrium was not reached yet in young fish.

Long-Term Support of an Active Subglacial Hydrologic System in Southeast Greenland by Firn aquifers	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The state of the subglacial hydrologic system, which can modify ice motion, is sensitive to the volume and rate of meltwater reaching it. Bare-ice regions rapidly transport meltwater to the bed via moulins, while in certain accumulation zone regions, meltwater first flows through firn aquifers, which can introduce a substantial delay. We use a subglacial hydrological model forced with idealized meltwater input scenarios to test the effect of this delay on subglacial hydrology. We find that addition of firn-aquifer water to the subglacial system elevates the inland subglacial water pressure while reducing water pressure and enhancing subglacial channelization near the terminus. This effect dampens seasonal variations in subglacial water pressure and may explain regionally anomalous ice velocity patterns observed in Southeast Greenland. As surface melt rates increase and firn aquifers expand inland, it is crucial to understand how inland drainage of meltwater affects the evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system. Plain Language Summary The flow of ice and meltwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet into the ocean affects sea levels. Ice flow is sensitive to meltwater that travels underneath the glacier. Where and when that water reaches the glacier bed shapes the water channel network under the glacier. We use a computer model to analyze how firn aquifers, newly discovered meltwater pockets that sit dozens of meters below the ice sheet surface in east Greenland, change the water channel network under local glaciers. We find that the firn-aquifer water supply can maintain a water channel network under the glacier that changes less over each season, compared to areas without firn-aquifer water. This subglacial channelization could explain observations of steadier glacier flow in locations with firn aquifers.					; Andrews, Lauren/D-8274-2017	Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258; Poinar, Kristin/0000-0002-1386-9659; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 16	2019	46	9					4772	4781		10.1029/2019GL082786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082786													WOS:000468869500025

Physical dynamics of Lake Victoria over the past 34 years (1984-2018): Is the lake dying?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Understanding changes in the physical dynamics of lakes (e.g., areas and shorelines) is important to inform policies, planning and management during climate extremes (e.g., floods and droughts). For Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, its physical dynamics and associated changes are not well understood as evidenced, e.g., from the citations of its area 66,400-69,485 km(2), length 300-412 km, width 240-355 km, and shorelines 3300-4828 km. Its sheer size and lack of research resources commitment by regional governments hamper observations. This contribution employs a suite of remotely sensed products for the past 34 years (1984-2018); Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS, Google Earth Pro, CHIRPS, Multivariate El' Nino-Southern Oscillation Index and altimetry data together with the physical parameters from 37 publications (1969-2018) to (i) study the lake's dynamics and establish its current (2018) state, (ii) identify and analyse hotspots where significantly dynamic changes occur, and (iii), study the contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities on these dynamics. Utilizing manual digitisation, MNDWI, NDVI and PCA methods, the study shows the lake's mean surface area to be 69,295 km2 (i.e., 812 km(2) or 1.2% more than that of the 37 publications) and its 2018 value to be 69,216 km2 (i.e., similar to 733 km(2) (1.1%) more than that of the 37 publications). As to whether the lake is dying, it shrunk by 203 km(2) (0.3%) compared to its 1984 value, a decrease noted mainly in four hotspot Gulfs (Birinzi 40%, Winam 20%, Emin Pasha 38% and Mwanza 55%). Correspondingly, the expansion of Nalubaale Dam (2002-2006) decreased the areas by 31%, 10%, 21% and 44%, respectively. Seasonal analysis shows an increase of 9 km(2) in the lake's area during the heavy rainy season (March-May) while the ENSO enlarged the area by 0.23% (2007) and 0.45% (2010). It is evident, therefore, that both climate variability/change and anthropogenic activities are exerting a toll on the tropical's largest freshwater body thereby necessitating careful exploitation and management plans.

We engaged agricultural and conservation stakeholders through a survey and workshops to determine which conservation practices to evaluate. We investigated feasible and desirable conservation practices using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool calibrated for streamflow, sediment, and nutrient loading near the Maumee River outlet. We found subsurface placement of phosphorus applications to be the individual practice most influential on March July dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading from row croplands. Perennial cover crops and vegetated filter strips were most effective for reducing seasonal total phosphorus (TP) loading. We found that practices effective for reducing TP and DRP load were not always mutually beneficial, culminating in trade-offs among multiple Lake Erie phosphorus management goals. Adoption of practices at levels considered feasible to stakeholders led to nearly reaching TP targets for western Lake Erie on average years; however, adoption of practices at a rate that goes beyond what is currently considered feasible will likely be required to reach the DRP target.

Part A: Evaluation of an integrated modelling framework to guide adaptive management implementation in Lake Erie	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												We present a technical analysis of all the recent modelling work that has been conducted to support the adaptive management process in Lake Erie; the most biologically productive system of the Great Lakes. With a wealth of models developed, Lake Erie represents a unique case study where an impressive variety of data-driven and process-based models have been developed to elucidate the major watershed and aquatic processes underlying the local water quality problems. In the Maumee River watershed, the primary contributor of total phosphorus loading (similar to 30%) into Lake Erie, the modelling work is based on five independent applications of the same process-based model, i.e., the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The five SWAT models showed nearly excellent goodness-of-fit against monthly flow rates and phosphorus loading empirical estimates based on a single downstream station, but little emphasis was placed on evaluating the robustness of the hydrological or nutrient loading predictions with a finer (daily) temporal resolution, and even less so in capturing the impact of episodic/extreme precipitation events. The multi-model ensemble for the Lake Erie itself has been based on a wide range of data-driven and process-based models that span the entire complexity spectrum. Consistent with the general trend in the international modelling literature, the performance of the aquatic ecological models in Lake Erie declined from physical, chemical to biological variables. Temperature and dissolved oxygen variability were successfully reproduced, but less so the ambient nutrient levels. Model performance for cyanobacteria was inferior relative to chlorophyll a concentrations and zooplankton abundance. With respect to the projected responses of Lake Erie to nutrient loading reduction, we express our skepticism with the optimistic predictions of the extent and duration of hypoxia, given our limited knowledge of the sediment diagenesis processes in the central basin and the lack of data related to the vertical profiles of organic matter and phosphorus fractionation or sedimentation/burial rates. Our study also questions the adequacy of the coarse spatio-temporal (seasonal/annual, basin- or lake-wide) scales characterizing the philosophy of both the modelling enterprise and water quality management objectives in Lake Erie. We conclude by arguing that one of the priorities of the local research agenda must be to consolidate the ensemble character of the modelling work in Lake Erie. The wide variety of models that have been developed to understand the major causal linkages/ecosystem processes underlying the local water quality problems are a unique feature that should be cherished and further augmented.					; Shimoda, Yuko/I-3521-2017; Dong, Feifei/AAW-7470-2020; Kim, Dong-Kyun/O-3813-2016; Arhonditsis, George/C-6980-2009	Dong, Feifei/0000-0003-1241-1563; Javed, Aisha/0000-0002-8516-6370; Neumann, Alex/0000-0003-1590-8516; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				SEP	2019	53								100968	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.014													WOS:000484875200002

The molecular structure, which contains physicochemical characteristics, was embedded as a fixed-length vector that is advantageous for data-driven analysis and machine learning. First, the molecular structure of the micropollutants was converted to a sequence of tokens using the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) pair encoding tokenizer, a frequency-based tokenization method. It was then compressed into fixed-length vectors using an autoencoder trained on various molecular structures within the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest. To validate the proposed models, a binary classification of micropollutant treatability was performed using the embedded molecular structure of micropollutants with various external features, such as concentration, season, and the presence of specific drinking water treatment processes by machine learning. The accuracy of the developed model for the 69 micropollutants in this study was 0.86, and the molecular structure was determined to be the most important feature. Furthermore, an accuracy of 0.71 was obtained in external validation for pharmaceuticals and personal care products that were not used for training. This shows that the proposed embedding vector can be generalized to unseen molecules during the training process, which means that it reflects the characteristics of the molecular structures.

Species responses to flow alteration are however poorly understood and are thus difficult to predict. Here, we investigated temporal changes in fish community structure (taxonomic and functional) in the Tonle Sap Lake, a floodplain ecosystem in Cambodia that supports the world largest inland fisheries and a UNESCO biosphere reserve. Fish catches were monitored daily at five locations around the lake between 2012 and 2015, with 53 species obtained over the course of the field study. Nine fish traits were recorded and used to characterize the functional composition of fish communities. Temporal changes in functional community structure in response to hydrological variation were assessed using multiple co-inertia analysis (MCOA) and cross-correlation function (CCF) approaches. Analyses revealed an abrupt shift in functional structure following extreme flood events in 2013 that included a marked decrease in large-bodied fish at high trophic levels. Also observed were seasonal changes in the relative abundance of life-history strategies, feeding habits, and accessory respiratory adaptations. Black fish (species that are relatively sedentary with an equilibrium-type life-history strategy) dominated during low-water periods, whereas white fish (migratory species with opportunistic or periodic life-history strategies) were dominant during high-water periods. Dynamics of local assemblage structure were fairly synchronous spatially and were independent of the distance between locations. Species responses to the peak flood pulse were estimated to lag 1-2 months. Findings from this study indicate that management of fisheries resources in the Tonle Sap Lake should consider differential responses of species to hydrology as a function of life-history strategies and other functional traits as well as factors that may influence time lags in population and community changes to extreme flow events.					; Chea, Ratha/KII-8058-2024; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019; chevalier, mathieu/AAU-6540-2020	Grenouillet, Gael/0000-0003-3588-3694; Chea, Ratha/0000-0002-1110-0766; 													2150-8925					DEC	2020	11	12							e03303	10.1002/ecs2.3303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3303													WOS:000603657600008

Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation.

Although in-situ observations most reliably quantify water quality metrics, the spatiotemporal distribution of such data are typically limited and cannot be readily extrapolated for either long-term projections or extensive areas. Alternatively, remotely sensed imagery has facilitated less expensive and a stronger ability to estimate water quality over a wide range of spatiotemporal resolutions. This study introduces an adaptive learning model that leverages in-situ measurements, satellite imagery, and machine learning algorithms to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of water surface SC in saline lakes. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by using high-resolution Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data in the Lake Urmia (LU), where 130 points were sampled in April and July 2019 for the model calibration and validation purposes. The results showed that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) yields the most accurate relationship between SC and water surface reflectance (R-2 = 0.94; NRMSE = 6.9%; MAE = 12.3 ppt) as compared to Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models. A sharp distinction in SC between the LU's northern and southern parts was observed during high flows due to the limitation on north-south water mixing imposed by the lake's middle causeway. Nevertheless, the impact of causeway on water circulation at the other seasons is minimum. A hysteretic relationship was also found between the lake water volume and the lake-averaged SC due to the distinct role of bed-salt dissolution and high evaporation rate at different seasons. A tight agreement between the SC variations in the southern part and the whole lake proved that the southern part dominantly controls SC dynamics in the whole lake.

Trace metal geochemistry of remote rivers in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Trace metals are essential micronutrients for phytoplankton, as well as useful tracers of biogeochemical processes in aquatic systems. The largest Arctic rivers are known to play an important role in the cycling of trace metals in the Arctic Ocean; however, these systems account for little more than half of Arctic freshwater discharge, leaving a major gap in our understanding of the trace metal geochemistry from smaller river systems. This is especially problematic for rivers draining the Arctic coastal margins, as these continuous permafrost systems are anticipated to be particularly sensitive to climate change. This study presents the first observations of dissolved and particulate trace metal concentrations and lead isotopes in 14 rivers in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). Dissolved concentrations of aluminum, iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead display clear spatial variability in their distributions. Small rivers located in the central islands of the CAA have remarkably low concentrations of these trace metals, while the rivers draining the southern continental landmass have higher values. This geographic variability in dissolved metal concentrations reflects both differences in bedrock geology and the South-North environmental gradients in the Archipelago. We extrapolate these findings to estimate the dissolved trace metal concentrations for other rivers draining the CAA based on their geographic location. Elemental ratios measured in the suspended particulate matter in several rivers indicates a significant enrichment of nickel, copper, zinc, and lead over the crustal composition. In particular, lead isotope composition shows an extremely large range, varying from the highly radiogenic Tree River (Pb-206/Pb-207: 1.5121) in the south, to the relatively unradiogenic Glacier River (Pb-206/Pb-207: 1.0153) in the central CAA. Lack of correlation between the Pb isotopic composition and Pb enrichment, suggests Pb is derived from within the watershed. This work presents the first observations of dissolved and particulate trace metal concentrations in small coastal draining rivers from the CAA, an important first step in developing a baseline against which to evaluate future change in the high Arctic.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of four different groundwater table depths (GTDs) and two soil textures on the process of soil freezing and thawing during two successive freeze-thaw periods using the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. The results show that the frost depth was the maximum when the GTD was 1.0 m, and the maximum frost depths of sandy loam and fine sand were 97.6 and 98.9 cm, respectively. When the GTD was larger than 1.5 m, the maximum frost depth decreased with an increase in GTD, and the maximum frost depth of the soil profile was more sensitive to changes in the air temperature. The frost depth of the soil profile was linear with the square root of the accumulated negative soil surface temperature (ANST) under different GTDs. The ANST was influenced by the phreatic evaporation, and the soil freezing rate increased with an increase in GTD under the same ANST. This research is significant for the rational development of soil water and heat resources and the study of soil water-heat transfer in shallow groundwater areas.					; Chen, Junfeng/AAX-6068-2020	Chen, Junfeng/0000-0002-2118-3307; 													1539-1663					MAR 14	2019	18	1							180157	10.2136/vzj2018.08.0157	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2018.08.0157													WOS:000461317100001

They are biological and biogeochemical hotspots. Due to small size, small perimeter and shallow depth biological and biogeochemical processes in kettle holes are closely linked to the dynamics and the emissions of the terrestrial environment. On the other hand, their intriguing high spatial and temporal variability makes a sound understanding of the terrestrial-aquatic link very difficult. It is presumed that intensive agricultural land use during the last decades has resulted in a ubiquitous high nutrient load. However, the water quality encountered at single sites highly depends on internal biogeochemical processes and thus can differ substantially even between adjacent sites. This study aimed at elucidating the interplay between external drivers and internal processes based on a thorough analysis of a comprehensive kettle hole water quality data set. To study the role of external drivers, effects of land use in the adjacent terrestrial environment, effects of vegetation at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and that of kettle hole morphology on water quality was investigated. None of these drivers was prone to strong with-in year variability. Thus temporal variability of spatial patterns could point to the role of internal biogeochemical processes. To that end, the temporal stability of the respective spatial patterns was studied as well for various solutes. All of these analyses were performed for a set of different variables. Different results for different solutes were then used as a source of information about the respective driving processes. In the Quillow catchment in the Uckermark region, about 100 km north of Berlin, Germany, 62 kettle holes have been regularly sampled since 2013. Kettle hole catchments were determined based on a groundwater level map of the uppermost aquifer. The catchments were not clearly related to topography. Spatial patterns of kettle hole water concentration of (earth) alkaline metals and chloride were fairly stable, presumably reflecting solute concentration of the uppermost aquifer. In contrast, spatial patterns of nutrients and redox-sensitive solutes within the kettle holes were hardly correlated between different sampling campaigns. Correspondingly, effects of season, hydrogeomorphic kettle hole type, shore vegetation or land use in the respective catchments were significant but explained only a minor portion of the total variance. It is concluded that internal processes mask effects of the terrestrial environment. There is some evidence that denitrification and phosphorus release from the sediment during frequent periods of hypoxia might play a major role. The latter seems to boost primary production occasionally. These processes do not follow a clear seasonal pattern and are still not well understood. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Fijani, E; Khosravi, K				Fijani, Elham; Khosravi, Khabat			Hybrid Iterative and Tree-Based Machine Learning Algorithms for Lake Water Level Forecasting	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Accurate forecasting of lake water level (WL) fluctuations is essential for effective development and management of water resource systems. This study applies the Random Tree (RT) algorithm and the Iterative Classifier Optimizer (ICO), which is based on the Alternating Model Tree (AMT) as an iterative regressor, to forecast WL up to three months ahead for Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. To enhance the accuracy of these machine learning (ML) algorithms, their forecasts are combined using ensemble algorithms such as Bagging (BA) or Additive Regression (AR), resulting in BA-RT, BA-ICO, AR-RT, and AR-ICO models. The most effective inputs for WL forecasting are determined using a nonlinear input variable selection method called partial mutual information selection (PMIS), considering lagged WL values up to 24 months. Forecasting models for each lake are developed using a training subset spanning from 1918 to 1988. The models' parameters are tuned using a validation subset covering 1989 to 2003. Finally, model performance is evaluated using a testing subset from 2004 to 2018. Statistical metrics and visual analysis with testing data are used to validate the performance of the developed algorithms. Additionally, results obtained from Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models serve as benchmarks for comparison with ML results. The findings demonstrate that ML models outperform SARIMA models in terms of error values: RMSPE ranges between 3.9% and 11.3% for Lake Michigan and between 2.3% and 9.2% for Lake Superior respectively. Furthermore, both hybrid ensemble algorithms improve individual ML algorithm performance; however, the BA algorithm achieves better overall performance compared to the AR algorithm. As a novel approach in forecasting problems, ICO algorithm based on AMT shows great potential in generating accurate multistep forecasts of lake WL. It demonstrates high generalization and low variance compared to the RT model.

Two types of occupation site can be distinguished: nine small and ephemeral scatters from single occupation phases on the slopes of sand dunes and three hearth sites indicative of repeated occupation on palaeolake shorelines. In addition, 245 rock art panels, 81 cairns, and 15 stone structures were recorded. This diverse dataset provides an opportunity to reconstruct occupation patterns and changes in landscape use. A particularly important site, Jebel Oraf 2, documents two episodes of lake high stands at ca. 6500 BC and 5300 BC, flooding parts of the locality. Neolithic pastoralists likely occupied the site after the end of the wet season, when the terrain was dry. Earlier sites are located in dune embayments some 7-14 m above the shore of the palaeolake. These locations are consistent with hunting strategies identifiable in the rock art that suggest wildlife was ambushed at watering places. Later rock art at Jebel Oraf also documents the hunting of wild camel in the Iron Age. The lithic industries documented in the Jebel Oraf basin support arguments of repeated contact with Levantine populations.

Little is known about Holocene anoxia and meromixis events when anthropogenic impacts were weaker and natural ecosystem variability played the dominant role. In this study, we examine the relationship between lake mixing and lake production, climate variability, vegetation cover, catchment erosion and (pre) historic anthropogenic impacts in Moossee (Switzerland), over the last 15,000 years. We use subannually resolved calibrated hyperspectral imaging data (total chlorophyll for paleoproduction, bacteriopheophytin for anoxia and meromixis) combined with X-ray fluorescence and pollen data. Production shows a first increase at 14,500 cal yr BP, a further increase after 7500 cal BP, relative maxima in the late Bronze, Iron and Middle Ages, and the unprecedented peak in the 20th Century. Until 7500 cal BP, the lake was well mixed with only scarce phases of seasonal to multiannual anoxia. Repeated meromixis events occurred between 7500 and 2500 cal BP when temperatures were high, forests closed, and lake production was already enhanced. After the forests were cleared (2500 cal BP) the lake remained mostly holomictic. Holocene meromixis events were systematically terminated by local deforestation related to Neolithic and Bronze Age Lakeshore settlements: charcoal peaked, tree pollen dropped below a threshold of 80%, soil erosion and lake production increased and bacteriopheophytin disappeared. Meromixis reestablished after the termination of Lakeshore settlements and the onset of afforestation with tree pollen exceeding 80%. These repeated cycles unambiguously document how even early human societies affected the mixing regime and biogeochemical cycling in this lake. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The treated tail water drained from them is clean relatively, and has a stable flow rate. Extracting heat from it through tail water source heat pumps (TWSHP) for space heating can decrease the building heating energy consumption significantly. Besides, by integrating with thermal energy storage (TES), it can realize the goal of peak load shifting, especially in commercial buildings. However, there is few reports on its experimental investigations or engineering applications till now. To promote the application of TWSHP integrated with TES system, it was designed for the space heating of a technology park in Beijing, and a control method was proposed to decrease the operating cost by using the valley electricity. Then, utilizing its operating parameters in the heating season of 2021-2022, its heating performance was analyzed. Results indicate that the proposed system has good heating performance. The average COPs of TWSHP units and the system in the heating season are 7.08 and 4.41, respectively. Compared with gas-fired boiler, its carbon emission decreased by 62.53%. By using the TES system, the power consumption during valley period of power grid increases by 581.23%, realizing the goal of peak load shifting.

Comparative Study of Different Stochastic Weather Generators for Long-Term Climate Data Simulation	CLIMATE												Climate is one of the single most important factors affecting watershed ecosystems and water resources. The effect of climate variability and change has been studied extensively in some places; in many places, however, assessments are hampered by limited availability of long-term continuous climate data. Weather generators provide a means of synthesizing long-term climate data that can then be used in natural resource assessments. Given their potential, there is the need to evaluate the performance of the generators; in this study, three commonly used weather generatorsCLImate GENerator (CLIGEN), Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), and Weather Generators (WeaGETS) were compared with regard to their ability to capture the essential statistical characteristics of observed data (distribution, occurrence of wet and dry spells, number of snow days, growing season temperatures, and growing degree days). The study was based on observed 1966-2015 weather station data from the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), from which 50 different realizations were generated, each spanning 50 years. Both CLIGEN and LARS-WG performed fairly well with respect to representing the statistical characteristics of observed precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures, although CLIGEN tended to overestimate values at the extremes. This generator also overestimated dry sequences by 18%-30% and snow-day counts by 12%-19% when considered over the entire WLEB. It (CLIGEN) was, however, well able to simulate parameters specific to crop growth such as growing degree days and had an added advantage over the other generators in that it simulates a larger number of weather variables. LARS-WG overestimated wet sequence counts across the basin by 15%-38%. In addition, the optimal growth period simulated by LARS-WG also exceeded that obtained from observed data by 16%-29% basin-wide. Preliminary results with WeaGETS indicated that additional evaluation is needed to better define its parameters. Results provided insights into the suitability of both CLIGEN and LARS-WG for use with water resource applications.					; Mehan, Sushant/Q-9862-2016; GUO, TIAN/U-7180-2019; GUO, TIAN/Y-9437-2018	Gitau, Margaret/0000-0002-4931-7047; Mehan, Sushant/0000-0002-1565-9591; GUO, TIAN/0000-0002-7166-3376; Flanagan, Dennis/0000-0001-7665-7170														2225-1154				JUN	2017	5	2							26	10.3390/cli5020026	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli5020026													WOS:000404568000002

Plant samples (above-ground shoot and below-ground root and rhizome) as well as sediment samples were collected monthly during one growing season and analyzed. The association of trace metals concentration with several sediment characteristics (pH, organic matter, clay and silt) was also studied using the simple linear correlation coefficient (r). The concentration of some trace metals was significantly proportional to its values in the sediment such as Cd in the shoot, rhizome and root. Fe in the rhizome, and Ag in the root. There was positive relationship between the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of Ag, Cd, Fe, Pb and Zn and sediment pH, organic matter and clay content. The developed regression models were significantly valid with high model efficiency and coefficient of determination, and low mean normalized average error. Trace metals were accumulated in the below-ground root and rhizome rather than in the shoot. Only Ag, Co and Ni provided bioaccumutation factor (BAF) < 1, while Ag was the only trace metal that could be transferred to some extend from the root to the rhizome and from there to the shoot [translocation factor (TF) 2.55 and 1.15, respectively]. Typha domingensis in Lake Burullus could be regarded as a bioindicator of trace metals pollution, and a good candidate as phytoremediator for Ag. The information on the phytoremediation capacity of T. domingensis certainly helps to solve contamination problems at Egyptian Lake Burullus region using this native plant. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Recent exploration efforts have indicated that laminar carbonates are closely related to the favorable depositional strata of shale oil. This research focused on inter-bedded layers of laminar carbonates as well as mudstone and shale in the Dongying depression of the Bohai Bay Basin in eastern China, and attempted to reveal the genesis and evolution of the carbonates by means of drill core observations, thin sections, high resolution scanning electron microscopic observations, and fluorometric, cathodoluminescence and geochemical analyses. The results demonstrated that (1) the carbonates could be categorized into two groups, crystalline carbonates and micritic carbonates; (2) the crystalline carbonates were well crystallized and greenish under fluorescent light; and (3) the micritic carbonates were not well crystallized and had biotic textures. It was discovered that the crystalline carbonates were mainly developed in the shale layer and were formed from the late-filling effects of the diagenetic cracks along the shale fissility planes; shale layers with crystalline carbonates are usually favorable for shale oil reserves. The micritic carbonates were formed from direct deposition controlled by biological effects in the stratified flows of the seasonal lake basins and are unfavorable for shale oil reserves.

Two decades of bacterial ecology and evolution in a freshwater lake	NATURE MICROBIOLOGY												Ecology and evolution are considered distinct processes that interact on contemporary time scales in microbiomes. Here, to observe these processes in a natural system, we collected a two-decade, 471-metagenome time series from Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA). We assembled 2,855 species-representative genomes and found that genomic change was common and frequent. By tracking strain composition via single nucleotide variants, we identified cyclical seasonal patterns in 80% and decadal shifts in 20% of species. In the dominant freshwater family Nanopelagicaceae, environmental extremes coincided with shifts in strain composition and positive selection of amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism genes. These genes identify organic nitrogen compounds as potential drivers of freshwater responses to global change. Seasonal and long-term strain dynamics could be regarded as ecological processes or, equivalently, as evolutionary change. Rather than as distinct interacting processes, we propose a conceptualization of ecology and evolution as a continuum to better describe change in microbial communities.

This study was aimed to reveal the distribution pattern of phosphorus forms, total nitrogen (TN), and total organic carbon (TOC), estimate the contributions of different phosphorus forms to total phosphorus, and evaluate the ecological risks of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in the sediments from Daye Lake, Central China. Method Thirty-nine surface sediment samples were collected in the dry season. TOC and TN were analyzed by an elemental analyzer. Phosphorus forms were determined based on the European standard SMT (Standard Measurements and Testing) method. The integrated pollution index method was used to assess the TN and TP pollution levels of sediment. The relationships between different phosphorus forms and TOC and TN in sediments were also discussed. Result and discussion TOC, TN, and TP contents in the sediments of Daye Lake were 0.96-6.15%, 859.8-5562.533 mg kg(-1), and 973.06-7982.86 mg kg(-1), respectively. The average contents of phosphorus in various forms were IP (1605.24 mg kg(-1)) > Ca-P (1093.39 mg kg(-1)) > OP (897.49 mg kg(-1)) > Fe/Al-P (523.79 mg kg(-1)). The contents of different phosphorus forms showed certain spatial differences due to the impact of human activities, agricultural, and industrial production. IP was the most important form of phosphorus in sediments, accounting for 49 similar to 63% of TP. TOC/TN ratio in the sediments ranged from 7.23 to 11.35, indicating that endogenous pollution was the main source. The results of TN and TP pollution in the surface sediments of Daye Lake evaluated by single pollution standard index method showed that the standard index of the TN (S-TN) ranged from 0.86 to 5.56 and the standard index of the TP (S-TP) ranged from 1.62 to 13.30. It indicated that N and P in sediments of Daye Lake were seriously polluted, and there was a potential risk of endogenous pollutant release which may further aggravate the eutrophication of water body. Conclusion The distribution of TN, TP, and TOC in the sediments showed a gradual decreasing trend from the downstream to the upstream in Daye Lake. TP in the sediments mainly existed in the form of IP. IP content was mainly influenced by Fe/Al-P and Ca-P. The ecological risk of nitrogen and phosphorous in the sediments was serious, and the water body was threatened by eutrophication.

In this study, we investigated spatial variability and temporal dynamics of two functional microbial sediment communities, methanogenic Archaea and methanotrophic bacteria, in Lake Bourget, France. Microbial communities were studied from 3 sites sampled 4 times over a year, with one core sampled at each site and date, and 5 sediment layers per core were considered. Microbial abundance in the sediment were determined using flow cytometry. Methanogens and methanotrophs community structures, diversity, and abundance were assessed using T-RFLP, sequencing, and real-time PCR targeting mcrA and pmoA genes, respectively. Changes both in structure and abundance were detected mainly at the water-sediment interface in relation to the lake seasonal oxygenation dynamics. Methanogen diversity was dominated by Methanomicrobiales (mainly Methanoregula) members, followed by Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales. For methanotrophs, diversity was dominated by Methylobacter in the deeper area and by Methylococcus in the shallow area. Organic matter appeared to be the main environmental parameter controlling methanogens, while oxygen availability influenced both the structure and abundance of the methanotrophic community.

Their distribution and community structure are driven by the combination and interactions between physical, chemical, and biological factors within the environment. In the present study, water quality and the community structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton were monthly investigated from January to December 2015 at 11 sampling sites along the gradient course of the Day River (Red River Delta, northern Vietnam). The study demonstrated that the Day River was eutrophic with the average values of total phosphorus concentration 0.17 mg/L, total nitrogen concentration 1.98 mg/L, and Chl a 54 mu g/L. Microscopic plankton analysis showed that phytoplankton comprised 87 species belonging to seven groups in which Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanobacteria accounted for the most important constituents of the river's phytoplankton assemblage. A total 53 zooplankton species belonging to three main groups including Copepoda, Cladocera, and Rotatoria were identified. Plankton biomass values were greatest in rainy season (3002.10-3 cell/L for phytoplankton and 12.573 individuals/m(3) for zooplankton). Using principal correspondence and Pearson correlation analyses, it was found that the Day River was divided into three main site groups based on water quality and characteristics of plankton community. Temperature and nutrients (total phosphorus and total nitrogen) are key factors regulating plankton abundance and distribution in the Day River.

Iestyn			Ensemble modeling of global lake evaporation under climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Global projections of lake evaporation are typically based on simulations using single mechanistic models. However, because of its complex interactions with various lake physical properties, environmental and anthropogenic drivers, lake evaporation is highly variable and sensitive to the choice of model used. In this study, we present a multi-model analysis to investigate differences across global simulations of lake evaporation during the warm-season using three different lake models driven by outputs from four general circulation models (GCM) (i.e. 12 model combinations in total) for historic and future scenarios. Our results suggest substantial differences among lake-climate model simulations of lake evaporation. These differences varied throughout the 20th and 21st century, with model driver data explaining 74% of the variance in future projections of warmseason lake evaporation. Our projections indicate that, by the end of the 21st century (2070-2099), global annual lake evaporation rates will increase by 10-27% under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6-8.5. We highlight the importance of using a multi-model approach for the prediction of future global lake evaporation responses to climate change.					; Tan, Zeli/G-7792-2018; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023	Lenters, John/0000-0002-6895-7592; Tan, Zeli/0000-0001-5958-2584; Jennings, Eleanor/0000-0002-9344-2056; La Fuente Pillco, Ruth Sofia/0000-0002-9665-672X													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2024	631								130647	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130647	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130647		FEB 2024											WOS:001178164700001

Assessment of future climate change impact on water balance components in Central Rift Valley Lakes Basin, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on the water balance component of the Katar and Meki watersheds of the Central Rift Valley Lakes Basin, Ethiopia. The semi-distributed soil and water assessment tool hydrological model and multiple regional climate model outputs were used to assess climate change impacts on water balance components and stream flow. Future climate scenarios were developed under a representative concentration pathway (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) for the 2040s (2021-2050) and 2070s (2051-2080). The study found that future annual and seasonal rainfall will show increasing and decreasing trends but that they are statistically insignificant. Furthermore, future temperatures show a significant increase in the subbasins. For the applied scenarios, an increasing and decreasing trend of future rainfall and increased temperatures would decrease the water yield by 4.9-15.3% at the Katar subbasin and 6.7-7.4% at the Meki subbasin. Furthermore, annual water yields will increase in the range of 0.38-57.1% and 6.57-49.9% for the Katar and Meki subbasins, respectively. The findings of this study will help basin planners, policymakers, and water resource managers develop appropriate adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate change in the rift-bound lake system.					; Dagnew, Amare/GWZ-9391-2022; Ayele, Gebiaw/D-3857-2017	Kebede, Sisay/0000-0001-8424-2928; Alemayehu, Taye/0000-0002-1638-450X													2040-2244	2408-9354				JAN	2023	14	1					175	199		10.2166/wcc.2022.249	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2022.249		DEC 2022											WOS:000901746700001

Since water management in areas with DSR is quite different from those with TPR, vertical water movement and water and nutrient losses during the crop season may be different as well. Water flow and water losses in a DSR field in the Taihu Lake Basin of east China were monitored and evaluated using Hydrus-1D during two seasons with different rainfalls and irrigation managements. While during the 2008 season, irrigation accounted for 57% of the total water input (TWI), during the 2009 season, it accounted for only 32%. Due to large rainfall during the wet, 2009 rice season, surface runoff accounted for about 17.0% of TWI. During the much drier 2008 rice season with higher irrigation inputs, surface runoff (4.6% of TWI) could be controlled much better. Modeled evapotranspiration during the 2008 and 2009 seasons accounted for 54.6% and 44.6% of TWIs, respectively. Measured and simulated results indicate that water leaching (approximately 42.7% and 34.9% of TWIs in the 2008 and 2009 seasons, respectively) was the main path of water loss from the DSR fields, which implies that frequent irrigation increases water leaching. The plough sole layer played a major buffering role for water flow during both dry and wet seasons. Water productivities evaluated from TWIs during the 2008 and 2009 seasons were 0.71 and 0.59 kg/m(3), respectively; they were 1.30 and 1.33 kg/m(3) when evaluated from modeled evapotranspiration fluxes. Pressure heads and vertical fluxes simulated using Hydrus-1D matched measured data well. The Hydrus-1D can be used to simulate water flow and water balance in the DSR fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These sediments are dated by the C-14 method in the case of organic remains, by counting annual laminations in lacustrine facies, and by dendrochronological method in the case of fluvial sediments. The existence of well dated profiles enables to reconstruct various climatic parameters like amplitudes of seasonal temperatures, types and frequency of extreme rainfalls and floods and, finally, to distinguish rare rapid changes and most frequent gradual ones. This reconstruction is based on the analogous effects of various types of present-day rainfalls. The current authors present a critical review of existing chronostratigraphic divisions starting from simple millennial division by Mangerud based on Scandinavian palynological stratigraphy of peat-bogs and Starkel's concept based on fluctuations in rainfall and runoff regime reflected in fluvial and other facies of continental deposits. In the last decades, the calibration of C-14 dates allowed a new approach to be used for the construction of the probability distribution function of these dates in various facies or types of sediments, which formed a background for distinguishing and correlating climatic phases and defining boundaries between them. These approaches have been creating new opportunities for revision of the existing chronostratigraphy. The aim of this paper is to present a revised version of chronostratigraphic division based on climatic fluctuations reflected in various facies of sediments on the territory of Poland and discuss their correlation with other European regions and global climatic changes.					; Michczynska, Danuta/HNS-8345-2023; Nalepka, Dorota/J-4678-2015; Margielewski, Wlodzimierz/AAV-7288-2021; Krapiec, Marek/MZS-2008-2025	Margielewski, Wlodzimierz/0000-0002-6327-1217; Pazdur, Anna/0000-0002-6078-798X; Nalepka, Dorota/0000-0002-5624-3488; Krapiec, Marek/0000-0003-4270-1668; Michczynska, Danuta/0000-0001-5348-5791; 													1897-1695					MAR	2013	40	1					1	21		10.2478/s13386-012-0024-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13386-012-0024-2													WOS:000312711500001

Identifying critical climate conditions for use in scenario-neutral climate impact assessments	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Scenario-neutral climate impact assessments are being used increasingly to assess water resource system responses to possible climate changes. The purpose of such assessments is to identify system sensitivity to a range of plausible climate conditions, often including an evaluation of the joint effect of multiple climate stressors. Given the large number of climate variables and associated statistics (averages, seasonality, intermittency, extremes, etc.) that could plausibly change and impact on system performance, it is essential that scenario-neutral assessments focus on those to which the system is most sensitive. A generic approach to identifying these 'critical' climate conditions is presented and tested on the Lake Como reservoir in Northern Italy considering two system objectives: irrigation deficit and flood reliability. Results indicate that different climate conditions are critical for the two objectives, and that the choice of which climate conditions to include has a significant effect on the climate impact assessment outcome.

This paper aims to analyse the dynamics of suspended sediment and to investigate the roles of different processes in order to explore flux pattern changes. We applied modelling on two scales, comprising a large-scale model (the whole delta) to consider the upstream characteristics, particularly the Tonle Sap Lake's flood regulation, and a smaller-scale model (tidal rivers and shelf) to understand the sediment processes on the subaqueous delta. A comprehensive comparison to in-situ measurements and remote sensing data demonstrated that the model is capable of qualitatively simulating sediment dynamics on the subaqueous delta. It estimates that the Mekong River supplied an amount of 41.5 mil tons from April 2014 to April 2015. A substantial amount of sediment delivered by the Mekong River is deposited in front of the river mouths in the high flow season and resuspended in the low flow season. A sensitivity analysis shows that waves, baroclinic effects and bed composition strongly influence suspended sediment distribution and transport on the shelf. Waves in particular play an essential role in sediment resuspension. The development of this model is an important step towards an operational model for scientific and engineering applications, since the model is capable of predicting tidal propagation and discharge distribution through the main branches, and in predicting the seasonal SSC and erosion/deposition patterns on the shelf, while it is forced by readily available inputs: discharge at Kratie (Cambodia), GFS winds, ERA40 reanalysis waves, and TPXO 8v1 HR tidal forcing.					; Thanh, Vo Quoc/AAH-4009-2019	Vo, Thanh/0000-0001-5940-1798; Eidam, Emily/0000-0002-1906-8692													0278-4343	1873-6955				SEP 1	2017	147				SI		213	230		10.1016/j.csr.2017.07.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2017.07.013													WOS:000413175900017

Multiple bias-correction of dynamically downscaled CMIP5 climate models temperature projection: a case study of the transboundary Komadugu-Yobe river basin, Lake Chad region, West Africa	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												General circulation model projections are inadequate for impact studies due to their coarse resolution and inherent biases. Therefore, there is a need to accurately correct these biases and examine the abilities of these correction techniques in replicating the observed climate change signals. Over the Komadugu-Yobe Basin, this study investigates the performance of univariate empirical and parametric quantile mapping, as well as multivariate bias-correction (BC) techniques, using; N-dimensional probability density function transform (MBCN), Spearman rank correlation dependency (MBCR) and Pearson correlation dependency (MBCP) in correcting the biases in some selected CMIP5-Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment model temperature projections based on the historical period (1975-2005) and the future (2020-2050) for annual, dry and wet periods under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). The temporal temperature variability of the BC outputs is further assessed. In correcting the temperature distribution, both univariate BC perform well for all seasons, while MBCN performs best during the dry season. The latitudinal-time cross-section result shows that high temperatures are mismatched either by the years of occurrence or by the latitudes at which they occurred. The univariate BC techniques and MBCN performed best in replicating the observed monthly variability. There is a positive temperature trend in most parts of the basin, however, with increased magnitudes in the future. Overall, the bias-corrected model ensemble mean performs better in replicating the trend in temperature, while the multivariate BC methods correct the joint dependence structure between them modelled variables, thereby providing a general-purpose methodology to the climate community.

Exploring hydro-meteorological drought patterns over the Greater Horn of Africa (1979-2014) using remote sensing and reanalysis products	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Spatio-temporal patterns of hydrological droughts over the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) are explored based on total water storage (TWS) changes derived from time-variable gravity field solutions of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE, 2002-2014), together with those simulated by Modern Retrospective Analysis for Research Application (MERRA, 1980-2014). These hydrological extremes are then related to meteorological drought events estimated from observed monthly precipitation products of Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC, 1979-2010) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM, 1998-2014). The major focus of this contribution lies on the application of spatial Independent Component Analysis (sICA) to extract distinguished regions with similar rainfall and TWS with similar overall trend and seasonality. Rainfall and TWS are used to estimate Standard Precipitation Indices (SPIs) and Total Storage Deficit Indices (TSDIs), respectively that are employed to characterize frequency and intensity of hydro-meteorological droughts over GHA. Significant positive (negative) changes in monthly rainfall over Ethiopia (Sudan) between 2002 and 2010 leading to a significant increase in TWS over the central GHA region were noted in both MERRA and GRACE TWS (2002-2014). However, these trends were completely reversed in the long-term (1980-2010) records of rainfall (GPCC) and TWS (MERRA). The four independent hydrological sub-regions extracted based on the sICA (i.e., Lake Victoria Basin, Ethiopia Sudanese border, South Sudan, and Tanzania) indicated fairly distinct temporal patterns that matched reasonably well between precipitation and TWS changes. While meteorological droughts were found to be consistent with most previous studies in all sub-regions, their impacts are clearly observed in the TWS changes resulting in multiple years of extreme hydrological droughts. Correlations between SPI and TSDI were found to be significant over Lake Victoria Basin, South Sudan, and Tanzania. The low correlations between SPI and TSDI over Ethiopia are likely related to inconsistency between TWS and precipitation signals. Further, we found that hydrological droughts in these regions were significantly associated with Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events while El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a secondary role.

Investigating dam-induced flow regime alterations is essential for understanding potential adverse downstream effects and facilitating dialogue around coordinated water use in transboundary basins, such as the Lancang River Basin (LRB). This study explored the value of combining several types of satellite Earth observation (EO) datasets that monitor different water balance components to constrain the parameter space of lumped conceptual hydrological models. Thus, we aimed to reconstruct the natural flow regimes upstream and downstream of the cascade reservoirs. Specifically, reservoir water storage changes were first estimated using satellite imagery and altimetry datasets. Then, storage changes were combined with hydrological model simulations of reservoir inflow to estimate the regulated flow regime downstream. Our results showed that integrated hydrological modeling combined with EO datasets exhibited better overall performance. Continuous warming and drying of the LRB resulted in a decrease in discharge of approximately 47 %. By comparing the simulated natural and regulated flow regimes, we revealed the pivotal role of the Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs in regulating natural flows. The wet season shortens (approximately 45 days), the flood peak flattens, and the low flow in the dry season has primarily increases. The two reservoirs attenuated 50 % of the flood peaks in the wet seasons and mitigated droughts by releasing up to 100 % of the natural flows in the dry seasons at the China-Laos border. Overall, these results enhance the understanding of upper reservoir operation, and the approaches can be applied to studies of dammed basins under climate change scenarios when knowledge of the upstream area is limited.					; Jiang, Liguang/E-3756-2017; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/HCI-0972-2022; Zhang, Xingxing/ABN-6594-2022; Liu, Jun/MHQ-2086-2025; Jiang, Hou/IQS-2635-2023; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/G-8725-2011; Liu, Zhaofei/KWU-3220-2024	Jiang, Hou/0000-0002-5087-3446; Jiang, Liguang/0000-0001-7907-1677; Kittel, Cecile Marie Margaretha/0000-0002-7711-9726; Zhang, Xingxing/0000-0001-6119-9322; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/0000-0002-9861-4240; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 1	2023	862								160656	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160656		DEC 2022						36493828					WOS:000928164100005

Previous studies have focused on Marine Protected Areas, while freshwater ecosystems, often accompanied by severe hydrological fluctuations, suggest new perspectives for flexible management. Poyang Lake is an essential habitat for the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis, YFP), supporting almost half of their natural population. However, studies on the movement patterns and habitat preferences of YFPs still lack there, preventing potential protected areas' effectiveness. In this study, we conducted 10 surveys for the YFP population in the main body and tributaries of Poyang Lake from October 2018 to August 2020. We used habitat modeling to analyze their seasonal habitat use and the environmental predictors. YFPs showed a seasonal movement pattern consistent with water level fluctuations. They entered the tributaries from the main lake body in low and medium water levels and returned to the main lake during high water level periods. The water depth was the most important environmental variable in each hydrological season that affects YFPs' habitat selection. The suitable water depth was about 4-8 m during the low water level, 612 m during the medium water level, and 7-20 m during the high water level. YFPs' 50% core habitats distribution showed noticeable seasonal changes. The proportion of their suitable habitats in the whole lake was relatively low, which was highest during high water level (16.89%), and the weakest during low water level (12.11%). Considering the seasonal movements of the YFPs in the lake, we recommend flexible management measures for their core habitats to alleviate human interference and restore their movement rhythm between the river and the lake, which shed light on protected area management for aquatic animals in such seasonal fluctuating habitats.

However, it is a difficult task due to the presence of clouds on satellite images. This study proposed the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Minimum Value Composite (MinVC) algorithm to generate daily water surface data at a 250-m resolution. The algorithm selected pixelwise minimum values from the combined daily Terra and Aqua MODIS NDVI data within a 15-day moving window. Consisting mainly of cloud and water surface information, the MinVC NDVI data were segmented for water surfaces over the Poyang Lake, China (2000-2017) by using an edge detection model. The water surface mapping result was strongly correlated with the Landsat based result (R-2 = 0.914, root mean square error, RMSE = 223.7 km(2)), the cloud free MODIS image based result (R-2 = 0.824, RMSE = 356.7 km(2)), the recent Landsat-MODIS image fusion based result (R-2 = 0.765, RMSE = 403 km(2)), and the hydrodynamic modeling result (R-2 = 0.799). Compared to the equivalent eight-day MOD13 NDVI based on the Constraint View-Angle Maximum Value Composite (CV-MVC) algorithm, the daily MinVC NDVI highlighted water bodies by generating spatially homogenous water surface information. Consequently, the algorithm provided spatially and temporally continuous data for calculating water submersion times and trends in water surface area, which contribute to a better understanding of hydro-ecological processes over seasonally flooded wetlands. Within the framework of sensor intercalibration, the algorithm can be extended to incorporate multiple sensor data for improved water surface mapping.					; Fan, Xingwang/H-6348-2019	LIU, Yuanbo/0000-0002-8780-927X; Fan, Xingwang/0000-0003-0099-1839														2072-4292				FEB	2020	12	4							700	10.3390/rs12040700	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12040700													WOS:000519564600111

However, the responses of vegetation and lakes to climate-related variables have rarely been contrastively studied. The Hulun Lake (HLL) and its surrounding grasslands in Northeast Inner Mongolia of China comprise a semi-arid region that has experienced intense climate change over the last several decades. This study aims to understand the key factors that control the variations in the lake area and vegetation cover over the last five decades in the HLL region, as well as contrastively investigate the different responses of the lake area and vegetation cover to climate-related variables. Analysis results indicate that the variations with increasing change rates in the HLL area were mainly controlled by precipitation fluctuation. Moreover, an increase or decrease in the air temperature and relative humidity could affect the response time of the HLL area to the change in precipitation. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variations from 1990 to 1999 around the HLL region were mainly controlled by the intense local grazing rather than climatic restrictions. The fluctuation in NDVI after 1999 reflects the response of the vegetation cover to climatic change. The correlation analysis shows that the variations in the HLL area were closely related to the multi-year tendency of precipitation amount and to the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with a long timescale. However, NDVI is sensitive to changes in short-term precipitation amount, such as seasonal precipitation, and in SPEI with a monthly timescale. The soil moisture at shallow depths (< 0.1 m) was the key root-zone soil moisture that could influence NDVI, whereas soil moisture at depths of 0.4 to 1.0 m and the HLL area were closely related and had similar responses to climatic change.

The ability of a time series of medium-resolution satellite data to generate quantitative information on macrophyte phenology was examined, focusing on three temperate shallow lakes with connected wetlands in Italy, France, and Romania. Leaf area index (LAI) maps for floating and emergent macrophyte growth forms were derived from a semiempirical regression model based on the best-performing spectral index, with an error level of 0.11 m(2) m(-2). Phenology metrics were computed from LAI time series using TIMESAT to analyze the seasonal dynamics of macrophyte spatial distribution patterns and species-dependent variability. Particular seasonal patterns seen in the autochthonous and allochthonous species across the three study areas related to local ecological and hydrological conditions. How characteristics of the satellite dataset (cloud cover threshold, temporal resolution, and missing acquisitions) influenced the phenology metrics obtained was also assessed. Our results indicate that, with a full-resolution time series (5-day revisit time), cloud cover introduced a bias in the phenology metrics of less than 2 days. Even when the temporal resolution was reduced to 15 days (like the Landsat revisit time) the timing of the start and the peak of macrophyte growth could still be mapped with an error of no more than 2-3 days.					; Nedelcut, Florin/J-9892-2014; Villa, Paolo/M-6015-2014; Bolpagni, Rossano/Q-7053-2018; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013	Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Jean-Marc, GILLIER/0000-0003-0626-4894; Bolpagni, Rossano/0000-0001-9283-2821; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2018	216						230	244		10.1016/j.rse.2018.06.048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.06.048													WOS:000445990100016

To assist in resolving the debates regarding the low water regime of the lake, the current study quantitatively assessed the enhanced water level decline from the changing underlying surface in the Poyang Lake region. It is the first time that the magnitude, temporal-spatial difference, trend development and background mechanism of lake water level variation and its causes are studied comprehensively. The results revealed that the changing underlying surface in the lake region has caused an average decline of annual water level of 0.26 m similar to 0.75 m across the lake during 2000-2014, which shows great seasonal and spatial differences. The enlarged outflow cross-section due to extensive sand mining was the major reason for the effect on water level decline in the northern lake. While, increased water surface gradient should be attributed to water level decline in the southern lake. The long-term increasing trend of annual lake water level decline reflects the cumulative effects of lake bottom topography change caused by the continuous south movement of sand mining activities.

Connecting precipitation inputs and soil flow pathways to stream water in contrasting boreal catchments	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Stable isotopes of water are one of the most widely used tools to track the pathways of precipitation inputs to streams. In the past, soils have often been treated as black-boxes through which precipitation is routed to streams without much consideration of how, when, and where water is transported along soil and groundwater flow paths. Here, we use time series of stable isotopes (O-18) in precipitation, soil/groundwater, and stream water to evaluate how landscape structure and heterogeneity influence seasonal hydrological patterns characteristic of boreal headwater catchments. To do this, we collected water throughout a full year at three adjacent catchments draining forest, mire, and mire/lake ecosystems within the Krycklan Experimental Catchment of northern Sweden. Isotope time series from forest and mire groundwater piezometers showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the dominant hydrologic flow pathways connecting precipitation to stream flow at different sites. The isotopic signature of stream water suggested strong connections to the dominant landscape elements within each catchment. These connections translated into greater temporal variability in the isotopic response of streams draining lake and wetland patches, and a much more attenuated pattern in the forest-dominated catchment. Overall, seasonal changes in the isotopic composition of streams and groundwater illustrate how differences in landscape structure result in variable hydrological patterns in the boreal landscape.

Seasonal dynamics of the fish assemblage in a floodplain lake at the confluence of the Negro and Amazon Rivers	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY					Symposium on Fish and Aquatic Habitat Conservation in South America during the 21st Brazilian Ichthyology Meeting	2015	Recife, BRAZIL					The temporal effect of discharge and limnology on fish composition and species diversity in a floodplain lake at the confluence of the Amazon and Negro Rivers was evaluated. Species richness, abundance and assemblage composition were strongly influenced by seasonal discharge of the Amazon and Negro Rivers, which affects lateral connectivity, water conductivity and temperature. As a consequence, temporal beta-diversity was high in the lake and the assemblage was dominated by seasonally transient species. Relatively large species known to feed on resources within the floodplain were captured almost exclusively during the flood period. During the dry season, the assemblage was dominated by fishes adapted to harsh conditions of high temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentrations. An open system with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity created by themeeting of two large rivers with different water chemistry, Lago Catalao has a dynamic fish assemblage. Given its high temporal beta-diversity and abundance of fishes, many of great importance in local fisheries, Lago Catalao and other floodplain lakes in this region merit special attention for conservation.

To perform the estimation, a hybrid method based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and seasons optimization (SO) algorithm was proposed. According to the irrigation and climate factors, six different models have been proposed to combine the parameters in the SO-ANFIS. The proposed method is evaluated on a test data set that contains information about apple orchards in Miandoab city from 2019 to 2021. The NSI model was compared with two popular irrigation methods including two-sided furrow irrigation (TSFI) and basin irrigation (BI) on benchmark scenarios. The results justified that the NSI model increased WUE by 1.90 kg/m(3) and 3.13 kg/m(3), and yield by 8.57% and 14.30% compared to TSFI and BI methods, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed SO-ANFIS has achieved the performance of 0.989 and 0.988 in terms of R-2 criterion in estimating WUE and yield of NSI irrigation method, respectively. The results confirmed that the SO-ANFIS outperformed the counterpart methods in terms of performance measures.

Using strontium isotopes to trace dust from a drying Great Salt Lake to adjacent urban areas and mountain snowpack	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												With the desiccation of saline lakes around the globe, it is increasingly important to quantify the impacts of playa dust on downwind urban areas and mountain snowpack. In this study, we used Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of carbonate minerals to trace dust from playas to urban areas and mountain snowpack. We focused on dust contributions from Great Salt Lake (GSL), in northern Utah, USA, which recently reached historic lows in water levels exposing large areas of dry lakebed. We measured Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in dust from GSL, Sevier Dry Lake (SDL), and other playas across western Utah and compared them to Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in dust across the urban Wasatch Front and mountain snowpack collected seasonally from 2015-2018. Dust from GSL had unique Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (similar to 0.715) relative to SDL (similar to 0.710) and other playas (similar to 0.711 to 0.712), providing a potentially powerful tool for tracing GSL dust to downwind areas. Dust deposition had Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios ranging from similar to 0.710 to similar to 0.712 in the urban area and snowpack, within the range of playa dust sources. Using a simple two-endmember mixing model considering only GSL and SDL as sources, GSL contributed 5% of the dust flux to the southern Wasatch Front (Provo) and between 30%-34% of the dust flux to the northern Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City, Ogden, and Logan). For mountain snowpack, GSL contributed 11% of the dust flux to the Uinta Mountains and 22% of the dust flux to the Wasatch Mountains. Dust transport modeling could be combined with Sr-87/Sr-86 fingerprints for source apportionment in northern Utah and other areas that are impacted by regional playa dust.

Wetlands are firstly demarcated into six types and CH4 emission is estimated for each wetland types during pre and post-monsoon seasons in order to assess seasonality effects on methanogenesis across wetland habitat types. Water Richness (WR) of the wetlands area was also assessed using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to investigate its effect on CH4 emission. Results show significant variation of wetland CH4 emission influenced by WR and seasonality. Very high WR zone is found over almost 18% wetland area where average monthly emission is< 0.5 ton/km(2). This rate is much lower than the average monthly emission of very low WR zone (> 3.0 ton/km(2)) covering more than 35% of the wetland area. Average monthly emission during pre-monsoon season is about 0.18 ton/km(2) and which decreases to 0.15 ton/km(2) during post-monsoon season. Considerable seasonal wetland areas make greater total CH4 emission during post-monsoon month than pre-monsoon. Highest average monthly emission rate is found over lakes which is 1.73 ton/km(2) during premonsoon and reduces to 0.54 ton/km(2) during post-monsoon followed by marshy wetlands. The bheries (local name of embanked wetland diurnally controlled by tidal water mainly used for pisciculture) show the lowest emission rate which is not more than 0.08 ton/km(2).

Kilimanjaro, reveal crucial aspects of climate-driven environmental change in equatorial East Africa since the Last Glacial Maximum. The finely laminated sediments of Lake Chala contain only up to 40% of clastic components, the rest are mainly diatom frustules and amorphous organic matter. Measured grain-size distributions were split into six statistically meaningful end members, of which four could be linked to a distinct source and transport mechanism of clastic mineral input: fine aeolian dust from distal sources (EMI ), fine catchment runoff (EM2), coarser aeolian dust from proximal sources (EM5) and coarse erosive material from the upper crater slopes (EM6). The two other end members (EM3 and EM4) represented frustules of the two most common diatom taxa in Lake Chala, Afrocymbella barkeri and Nitzschia fabiennejansseniana, which had (partly) survived sample pre-treatment. Temporal variation in normalized abundance of the two dust-derived end members are valuable proxies for past changes in monsoon circulation over equatorial East Africa. During Northern Hemisphere cold periods (e.g., Last Glacial Maximum and Younger Dryas) the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone shifted southward, enhancing northeasterly monsoon winds in the Lake Chala area and increasing advection of fine dust from the dry Horn of Africa region. Simultaneously, more modest continental heating reduced the prevalence of small-scale atmospheric turbulence, and thus the occurrence of dust devils, resulting in reduced influx of coarse dust from drylands nearby. Conversely, abrupt intensification of the southeasterly monsoon at the onset of the Holocene is recorded by an abrupt increase in the amount of coarse dust delivered to Lake Chala. Temporal variation in the end members representing catchment run-off (EM2) and erosion (EM6) mainly reflect changes in lacustrine sedimentation dynamics associated with major lake-level fluctuation, as evidenced by other paleoenvironmental proxies. Overall this study shows that subdivision of the clastic fraction of lacustrine sediments into statistically robust grain-size end members can provide multiple independent and quantitative proxies which help constrain reconstructions of a region's multi-faceted climate history.

Besides chloride, edible salt also contains other anions such as bromide, fluoride, sulfate, and carbonate due to incomplete removal during raw salt refinement. In a household cooking (e.g., soup making) process, a chlorine/monochloramine residual in tap water could react with bromide in edible salt and organic matter in food (e.g., rice, wheat) to form numerous brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs) at significant levels, which might induce adverse health effects to human beings. In this study, we solicited 20 edible salts of different types (i.e., sea salts, well and rock salts, lake salts, and bamboo salts) from nine countries and determined their bromide levels to be 67-375 mg/kg, with an average level of 173 mg/kg. A total of 25 polar Br-DBPs were detected and identified with structures/formulae in cooking water samples using ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadruple mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-tqMS) and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Effects of cooking conditions (e.g., disinfectant type and level, edible salt dose, organic matter type and dose, sequence and time interval of adding organic matter and salt, etc.) on the formation of polar Br-DBPs were investigated, and optimized cooking conditions with minimized formation of polar Br-DBPs were determined. Further aided with an Hep G2 cell cytotoxicity assay, it was found that the overall cytotoxicity of chlorinated and chloraminated cooking water samples prepared after cooking condition optimization was reduced by 57% and 22%, respectively, compared with those prepared before cooking condition optimization.

Understanding of N uptake strategies of riparian plants, including N sources and preference in N forms (ammonium (NH4+) vs. nitrate (NO3-)), is essential to advance our knowledge on the role that plants play in regulating nutrient biogeochemical cyclings in the riparian areas. In this study, stable N isotopes (delta N-15) of three riparian plants, including Acorus calamus, Canna indica and Phragmites australis, and the delta N-15 of NH4+ and NO3- in different sources were measured during the plant growing season (June-September) in the Taihu Lake Basin. The dissolved inorganic N (DIN) from river water, groundwater, rainwater and soil were considered as the major N sources for plants in the riparian ecosystem. Our results indicated that soil was the largest source for plant N nutrition, with significantly different (P < 0.05) contributions from soil observed among plant species (80.5 +/- 4.1, 73.9 +/- 2.8 and 58.7 +/- 6.1% for A. calamus, C. indica, and P. australis, respectively). Meanwhile, complex water networks, shallow water tables, and high DIN content in rainwater lead to nonignorable N contributions from river water, groundwater and rainwater to plants. Groundwater contributed more percentage of N to P. australis (12.8 +/- 3.2%) than A. calamus (6.1 +/- 1.9%) and C. indica (8.0 +/- 1.5%), which is likely attributed to the deeper roots of P. australis. All plants showed similar N preference for NO3- during the growing season. External environmental conditions and plant characteristics and adaption to more abundant soil NO3- content are possible explanations. Our research could provide important information for vegetation selections during the process of riparian ecological restoration. Reasonable choice of vegetation is essential to plant growth and water quality management, especially in agricultural watersheds where N concentrations are relatively high in agricultural runoff due to the wide uses of N fertilizers.

Because of its intricate implication to hydro-meteorological condition and climate system, stable isotopes in precipitation (e.g. delta H-2(p) and delta O-18(p)) provide us a powerful tool to understand the climate-hydrologic dynamics in shrinking lakes. However, how the regional atmospheric circulation, moisture sources and local fractionation processes drive isotopic variability from temporal to spatial scale has rarely been reported for remote plateau lakes. Hence, we collected a total of 98 rainfall samples at the south and the north shores of Chenghai lake, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to study the potential driving forces of precipitation isotope variability during the wet season of 2019. Based on backward trajectories of air masses obtained from HYSPLIT model, 68% of moisture came from delta O-18 depleted ocean (Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, South China Sea and Pacific Ocean), and the rainout process promoted the isotopic depletion when moisture arrived at the study basin. Evapotranspiration increased the heavy isotope ratios in precipitation originated from continents (northern China inland and western continents). The temporal dynamics of delta O-18(p) and delta H-2(p) were in phase with the convection activities intensity underlined the influence from large-scale atmospheric circulation. Local meteorological factors played a secondary role in isotope variability. Precipitation amount-effect strongly affected isotope ratios while mild anti-temperature effect was observed at daily scale. Interestingly, the rainfall isotope ratios showed different mechanisms in govern at lake south shore and north shore, with a distance of 19 km in between. This south-to-north difference can be explained by either lower 1.03% sub-evaporation in the south shore or 7% of recycled moisture contributing to precipitation in the north shore. Our findings discover the driving forces for delta O-18(p) variation and provide solid interpretations for hydro-climate change in Southwest China. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate how the source and composition of CDOM changes in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and fluorescence analyses to characterize CDOM in Lake Tianmuhu (a drinking water source) and its catchment in China. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified three individual fluorophore moieties that were attributed to humic-like and protein-like materials in 224 water samples collected between December 2008 and September 2009. The upstream rivers contained significantly higher concentrations of CDOM than did the lake water (a(350) of 4.27 +/- 2.51 and 2.32 +/- 0.59 m(-1), respectively), indicating that the rivers carried a substantial load of organic matter to the lake. Of the three main rivers that flow into Lake Tianmuhu, the Pingqiao River brought in the most CDOM from the catchment to the lake. CDOM absorption and the microbial and terrestrial humic-like components, but not the protein-like component, were significantly higher in the wet season than in other seasons, indicating that the frequency of rainfall and runoff could significantly impact the quantity and quality of CDOM collected from the catchment. The different relationships between the maximum fluorescence intensities of the three PARAFAC components, CDOM absorption, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration in riverine and lake water indicated the difference in the composition of CDOM between Lake Tianmuhu and the rivers that feed it. This study demonstrates the utility of combining excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and PARAFAC to study CDOM dynamics in inland waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the dual effects on river water cycles have not yet attracted sufficient attention along the Yangtze River because of the relative consistency of annual water regimes. This study first explored the altered water cycle associated with damming and drought using surface water isoscapes (818O and 82H) of river and lake water along the Yangtze River during the flooding seasons of 2016 and 2018, combined with other historical isotopic data from 2003 to 2013. The results show that river water isotopes are markedly varied on both spatial and temporal scales. The relatively more enriched river water representing 818O values were observed from 2003 to 2007 compared with those in 2018, which were possibly caused by increased evaporative fractionation under abnormal drought conditions in the Yangtze River. Spatially, river water 818O values exhibited a positive trend from upstream to the lower reaches because of the contrasting recharged sources, complex mixing, and evaporation from upstream to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This trend was related to variations in surface water temperature and water evaporation during the flooding seasons evidenced by a significant correlation between river isotopes and river water temperature. Moreover, the large variability in deuterium-excess (dexcess) and 818O in the downstream could be inherited from the upstream because of short residence time and incomplete mixing in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) during the initial stage of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) operation (2003-2007). In contrast, the relatively lower variability of d-excess and 818O was found in the downstream area due to the complete mixing in the TGR, causing the homogenization of reservoir water during the normal operation stage after 2010 (e.g., 2013 and 2018). Drought stimulates evaporative fractionation on river water and result in more negative d-excess values especially in 2006. The dual effects of river damming and drought remarkably changed the longitudinal hydrological connectivity and water cycle dynamics by prolonging the residence time and enhancing the water mixing, which should be thoroughly considered for water resource management, especially for regions with heavily-regulated rivers.

Changes in land surface water dynamics since the 1990s and relation to population pressure	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We developed a remote sensing approach based on multi-satellite observations, which provides an unprecedented estimate of monthly distribution and area of land-surface open water over the whole globe. Results for 1993 to 2007 exhibit a large seasonal and inter-annual variability of the inundation extent with an overall decline in global average maximum inundated area of 6% during the fifteen-year period, primarily in tropical and subtropical South America and South Asia. The largest declines of open water are found where large increases in population have occurred over the last two decades, suggesting a global scale effect of human activities on continental surface freshwater: denser population can impact local hydrology by reducing freshwater extent, by draining marshes and wetlands, and by increasing water withdrawals.

J	Matthews, MW				Matthews, Mark William			Eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms in South African inland waters: 10 years of MERIS observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The medium resolution imaging spectrometer full resolution (MERIS FR) archive (2002 to 2012) over South Africa has been processed with the maximum peak height (MPH) algorithm for the 50 largest standing water bodies in South Africa. Time series of chlorophyll a (chl-a), cyanobacteria and surface scum area coverage were used to establish the status, seasonality and trends for each of the water bodies. The majority (62%) of the 50 water bodies were hypertrophic (mean chl-a > 30 mg m(-3)), while 23 water bodies had intermediate to extensive cyanobacteria coverage. Cyanobacterial surface scum events posing a high health risk occurred in 26 of the water bodies in varying extents. Analysis of significant trends showed that water bodies both worsened and improved with regard to eutrophication, cyanobacteria and surface scum coverage between 2005 and 2012. Validation of the MPH algorithm using an independent in situ dataset demonstrated that gross trophic status through chl-a can be accurately determined in both eukaryote and cyanobacteria-dominant waters. Chl-a estimation in oligo/mesotrophic waters remains challenging due to a wide range of potential sources of error. This study is the first of its kind providing quantitative chl-a and phytoplankton species information in lakes from a time series of satellite remotely sensed data on a sub-continental scale, demonstrating how global analyses of changes in lake biogeochemistry might be performed in the future. It demonstrates the pivotal role that satellite remote sensing can play in supplementing in situ monitoring efforts, particularly in the developing world. The study concludes that eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms are widespread in South African water bodies and remain issues of critical concern for water quality.

However, the environmental impacts under different integrated management have been rarely evaluated. Field experiments with four management practices were conducted in the Taihu Lake region to assess an important N loss pathway from paddy fields-NH3 volatilization for two consecutive rice seasons. The four treatments included control with 0 N fertilizer (CK), local conventional production practice (CT), integrated high-efficiency practice (HE), and high-yield practice (HY) with more nutrient inputs (relative to CT). NH3 volatilization was measured and plant samples were collected for determining the dry matter yield and apparent nitrogen recovery (ANR) efficiency. During the two rice-growing seasons, the HE treatment had 47.8 and 39.7 percentage points lower total NH3 losses, whereas the HY treatment had 12.6 and 48.9 percentage points higher those than the CT treatment. The HE and HY treatments resulted in significantly higher grain yield and ANR in the two seasons. The HE treatment had 11.1 and 18.0 percentage points higher yields than CT, while the HY treatment had 34.6 and 40.4 percentage points higher those than the CT treatment in the 2 years. The ANR was improved by 9.2 and 26.2 percentage points for the HE treatment, and by 9.4 and 15.6 percentage points for the HY treatment compared with the CT treatment. Furthermore, the ratio of ammonia emission to grain yield for HE treatment was 53.6 and 49.1 percentage points lower than CT treatment, and 44.2 and 51.8 percentage points lower than HY treatment during the two seasons, respectively. Therefore, the integrated high-efficiency practice is effective in reducing NH3 loss and increasing rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and can be used for the sustainable development of rice production systems in the Taihu Lake region.

A decade of seasonal dynamics and co-occurrences within freshwater bacterioplankton communities from eutrophic Lake Mendota, WI, USA	ISME JOURNAL												With an unprecedented decade-long time series from a temperate eutrophic lake, we analyzed bacterial and environmental co-occurrence networks to gain insight into seasonal dynamics at the community level. We found that (1) bacterial co-occurrence networks were non-random, (2) season explained the network complexity and (3) co-occurrence network complexity was negatively correlated with the underlying community diversity across different seasons. Network complexity was not related to the variance of associated environmental factors. Temperature and productivity may drive changes in diversity across seasons in temperate aquatic systems, much as they control diversity across latitude. While the implications of bacterioplankton network structure on ecosystem function are still largely unknown, network analysis, in conjunction with traditional multivariate techniques, continues to increase our understanding of bacterioplankton temporal dynamics.

In this study, the concentrations, temporal and regional distribution characteristics, and fluxes of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) in the surface seawater and terrestrial sewage of Zhanjiang Bay (ZJB) in four different seasons were investigated. The results identified the heavy metal concentrations in the sewage outlet around ZJB had significant seasonal variation. The heavy metals in the surface seawater of ZJB had significant spatiotemporal variations. Terrestrial input, biological activity and hydrodynamics affected the overall distribution. The heavy metal emission fluxes indicated that riverine input was the main influencing factor for heavy metals in ZJB (96.22 %).

J	Onyutha, C				Onyutha, Charles			Trends and variability of temperature and evaporation over the African continent: Relationships with precipitation	ATMOSFERA												This study analyzes changes in the long-term (1901-2015) monthly values of potential evapotranspiration (PET), precipitation, and minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures across Africa to quantify trends and assess covariability between these climatic variables. Both warming and drying trends were observed across the continent. The 1979-2015 warming was stronger than that from 1901 to 1940. Some cooling occurred from 1941 to the mid-1970s. The 1901-2015 annual Tmax, Tmin, and PET averaged over Africa exhibited increasing or drying trends across the continent at rates of 0.18 degrees C, 0.22 degrees C, and 3.5 mm per decade, respectively. The 1961-1990 annual precipitation averaged over the whole continent showed that Africa experienced drying at a rate of about -28 mm per decade. When considering the period 1961-2015, the rate of precipitation decrease was about -8 mm per decade. From 1901 to 1915, areas around Lake Victoria in East Africa and along the western coastline south of the equator experienced wetting rates of up to 36 mm per decade. Significant (p < 0.01) warming trends occurred in Sudan, Southern and Northern Africa. Positive PET trends were significant (p < 0.01) in the warm Mediterranean climate, and the western part of South Africa. Long-term temperature increase and precipitation decrease across northern Africa possibly indicated the Sahara Desert expansion over time. Except in the warm desert climate, the continent exhibited high precipitation variability. Equatorial climate experienced low temperature and PET variability. The strongest coherence between precipitation and temperature existed at multiple scales (6-8 years). Correlations between precipitation and PET (or temperature) were mostly negative and weak (p > 0.01). Because the sensitivity of T-min to local influences is higher than that of T-max, areas with strong negative correlation were larger in coverage for T-max than those of T-min. These results call for planned measures to tackle food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa.

J	Zhang, GQ; Li, JL; Zheng, GX				Zhang, Guoqing; Li, Junli; Zheng, Guoxiong			Lake-area mapping in the Tibetan Plateau: an evaluation of data and methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Lake area derived from remote-sensing data is a primary data source, because changes in lake number and area are sensitive indicators of climate change. These indicators are especially useful when the climate change is not convoluted with a signal from direct anthropogenic activities. The data used for lake-area mapping is important, to avoid introducing unnecessary uncertainty into long-term trends of lake-area estimates. The methods for identifying waterbodies from satellite data are closely linked to the quality and efficiency of surface-water differentiation. However, few studies have comprehensively considered the factors affecting the selection of data and methods for mapping lake area in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), nor of evaluating their consequences. This study tests the dominant data sets (Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data) and the methods for automated waterbody mapping on 14 large lakes (> 500 km(2)) distributed across different climate zones of the TP. Seasonal changes in lake area and data availability from Landsat imagery are evaluated. Data obtained in October is optimal because in this month the lake area is relatively stable. The data window can be extended to September and November if insufficient data is available in October. Grouping data into threeyear bins decreases the effects of year-to-year seasonal variability and provides a long-term trend that is suitable for time series analysis. The Landsat data (Multispectral Scanner, MSS; Thematic Mapper, TM; Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, ETM+; and Operational Land Imager, OLI) and MODIS data (MOD09A1) showed good performance for lake-area mapping. The Otsu method is used to determine the optimal threshold for distinguishing water from non-water features. Several water extraction indices, namely NDWIMcFeeters, NDWIXu, and AWEI(non-shadow), yielded high overall classification accuracy (92%), kappa coefficient (0.83), and user's accuracy (similar to 90%) for lake-water classification using Landsat data. The MODIS data using NDWIMcFeeters and NDWIXu showed consistent lake area (r(2) = 0.99) compared with Landsat data on the corresponding date with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 86.87 and 103.33 km(2) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 25.7 and 29.04 km(2), respectively.

As an important lake region in China, the water turbidity of lakes/reservoirs in the Northeast Plain -Mountainous Region (NPLR) remains less understood, especially the influencing mechanisms of regional cli-matic conditions and human activities. To enhance the knowledge of turbidity dynamics and explanatory var-iables of NPLR water bodies, long-term turbidity estimates of lakes/reservoirs were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua observations between 2003 and 2019. The results show that most lakes/reservoirs became less turbid in NPLR during the study period, as indicated by a decreasing turbidity trend of 0.05-2.4 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)/year. Overall, the decreased turbidity was mainly attributed to the decreased wind speed (from 2003 to 2012, r = 0.85, p < 0.01), but also to the increased normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the forest region (r =-0.80, p < 0.01), with the latter being a result of the forest protection efforts of the Chinese government. The increased snowmelt depth also contributed to a substantial turbidity decline in April. In addition, distinct seasonal patterns of turbidity were observed in the NPLR, with less turbid water in the wet season (i.e., from June to August) and turbid water in the dry season (i.e., October, November, and April in the next year). This result is attributed to the rapid seasonal dynamics of precipitation and runoff. This study provided a comprehensive analysis on the influencing mechanisms of turbidity dynamics in NPLR lakes; in particular, for the first time, revealed the impacts of the national policy -mandated forest development and the snowmelt depth on lake turbidity. These findings will provide vital in-formation for government decision-making in water environment protection in NPLR and other similar areas with densely distributed lakes.					hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012; Feng, Lian/JQI-0512-2023														0959-6526	1879-1786				SEP 25	2022	368								133148	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133148		AUG 2022											WOS:000862590300002

Improving the lake scheme within a coupled WRF-lake model in the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												In this study, a one-dimensional (1-D) thermal diffusion lake model within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was investigated for the Laurentian Great Lakes. In the default 10-layer lake model, the albedos of water and ice are specified with constant values, 0.08 and 0.6, respectively, ignoring shortwave partitioning and zenith angle, ice melting, and snow effect. Some modifications, including a dynamic lake surface albedo, tuned vertical diffusivities, and a sophisticated treatment of snow cover over lake ice, have been added to the lake model. A set of comparison experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performances of different lake schemes in the coupled WRF-lake modeling system. Results show that the 1-D lake model is able to capture the seasonal variability of lake surface temperature (LST) and lake ice coverage (LIC). However, it produces an early warming and quick cooling of LST in deep lakes, and excessive and early persistent LIC in all lakes. Increasing vertical diffusivity can reduce the bias in the 1-D lake but only in a limited way. After incorporating a sophisticated treatment of lake surface albedo, the new lake model produces a more reasonable LST and LIC than the default lake model, indicating that the processes of ice melting and snow accumulation are important to simulate lake ice in the Great Lakes. Even though substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the 1-D lake model, it still remains considerably challenging to adequately capture the full dynamics and thermodynamics in deep lakes.

For this, seasonal water quality changes were assessed in comparison to the LULC changes recorded from 2010 to 2019. Obtained results from this study indicated that pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations were higher during the dry season, while dissolved oxygen (DO), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), temperature, total suspended solids (TSS), and total solids (TS) concentrations also changed with the season. The analysis of LULC changes within 1000-m buffer zones around the sampling stations revealed that agricultural and vegetation classes decreased; while built-up, waterbody and barren lands increased. Correlation analyses showed that BOD5, temperature, EC, TDS, and TSS had a significant relationship (5% level) with LULC types. The regression result indicated that BOD5 was sensitive to changing waterbody (predictors, R-2 = 0.645), temperature was sensitive to changing waterbodies and agricultural land (R-2 = 0.889); and EC was sensitive to built-up, vegetation, and barren land (R-2 = 0.833). Waterbody, built-up, and agricultural LULC were predictors for TDS (R-2 = 0.993); and waterbody, built-up, and barren LULC were predictors for TSS (R-2 = 0.922). Built-up areas and waterbodies appeared to have the strongest effect on different water quality parameters. Scientific finding from this study will be vital for decision makers in developing more robust land use management plan at the local level.					; kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023	xie, zhixiao/0009-0003-9184-0020; Uddin, Md.

Recent alterations of WLFs in China's largest freshwater lake (i.e. the Poyang Lake), have received considerable attentions due to its large influences on ecosystem functioning and health. Here, we proposed a reliability (Rel)-resilience (Res)-vulnerability (Vul) framework to quantify the influence of changes in seasonal WLFs on lake conditions. Key parameters of WLFs were identified, including high and low water level thresholds, onset and ending time of high and low water level periods, and daily water level change rate. Reliability, resilience and vulnerability of the Poyang Lake in four periods of water levels (i.e. high and low, rising and retreating) were calculated for each year between 1953 and 2014 based on the occurrence probability, duration and severity of failure events (extreme water level and anomalous water level change rate). We found that mean daily water level between 1953 and 2002 was always lower than that observed between 2003 and 2014 (the time period after impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir). High water level period in 2003-2014 was 17 days shorter than that in 1953-2002, while low water level period in 2003-2014 was 53 days longer than that in 1953-2002. Reliability and resilience of the Poyang Lake in 2003-2014 generally decreased compared with those in 1953-2002, especially in the rising and retreating periods, while the vulnerability increased in the two periods. There was a declining tendency in WLFs-based health index particularly after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, suggesting that the condition of the Poyang Lake has become worse. This Rel-Res-Vul framework establishes quantitative linkages between WLFs changes and ecosystem conditions, and provides a feasible tool for water level management that is applicable to other lakes with similar hydrological regimes.

The seasonal variation and spatial variation of three sub-lakes of Poyang Lake, a huge wetland in the middle Yangtze Basin, were investigated to examine how fish assemblages respond to seasonal hydrology and associated environmental conditions. In all three sub-lakes, fish assemblage structure revealed strong variations associated with seasonal water level fluctuation. Fish species richness in all sub-lakes was highest during the middle of the monsoon season and lowest during the dry season. Fish numerical abundance and biomass varied significantly, with several of the most common species having inconsistent patterns of seasonal variation among sub-lakes. Fish assemblage structure was significantly associated with environmental gradients defined by water level, aquatic macrophyte coverage, conductivity and dissolved oxygen concentration. Assemblage composition in all three sub-lakes underwent strongest shifts between December and April, the period when water levels were lowest and fishing has the greatest impact on fish stocks. Future impacts that change the hydrology of the middle Yangtze would alter the dynamics of habitat connectivity and affect environmental conditions and fish assemblages of the Poyang Lake wetland system.					/AAB-6512-2020	Jin, Binsong/0000-0003-2123-1484													0969-997X	1365-2400				APR	2019	26	2					131	140		10.1111/fme.12333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12333													WOS:000460175900004

Biological Connectivity of Seasonally Ponded Wetlands across Spatial and Temporal Scales	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Many species that inhabit seasonally ponded wetlands also rely on surrounding upland habitats and nearby aquatic ecosystems for resources to support life stages and to maintain viable populations. Understanding biological connectivity among these habitats is critical to ensure that landscapes are protected at appropriate scales to conserve species and ecosystem function. Biological connectivity occurs across a range of spatial and temporal scales. For example, at annual time scales many organisms move between seasonal wetlands and adjacent terrestrial habitats as they undergo life-stage transitions; at generational time scales, individuals may disperse among nearby wetlands; and at multigenerational scales, there can be gene flow across large portions of a species' range. The scale of biological connectivity may also vary among species. Larger bodied or more vagile species can connect a matrix of seasonally ponded wetlands, streams, lakes, and surrounding terrestrial habitats on a seasonal or annual basis. Measuring biological connectivity at different spatial and temporal scales remains a challenge. Here we review environmental and biological factors that drive biological connectivity, discuss implications of biological connectivity for animal populations and ecosystem processes, and provide examples illustrating the range of spatial and temporal scales across which biological connectivity occurs in seasonal wetlands.

J	Dao, PD; Liou, YA				Dao, Phuong D.; Liou, Yuei-An			Object-Based Flood Mapping and Affected Rice Field Estimation with Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS Data	REMOTE SENSING												Cambodia is one of the most flood-prone countries in Southeast Asia. It is geographically situated in the downstream region of the Mekong River with a lowland floodplain in the middle, surrounded by plateaus and high mountains. It usually experiences devastating floods induced by an overwhelming concentration of rainfall water over the Tonle Sap Lake's and Mekong River's banks during monsoon seasons. Flood damage assessment in the rice ecosystem plays an important role in this region as local residents rely heavily on agricultural production. This study introduced an object-based approach to flood mapping and affected rice field estimation in central Cambodia. In this approach, image segmentation processing was conducted with optimal scale parameter estimation based on the variation of objects' local variances. The inundated area was identified by using Landsat 8 images with an overall accuracy of higher than 95% compared to those derived from finer spatial resolution images. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index products were utilized to identify the paddy rice field based on seasonal inter-variation between vegetation and water index during the transplanting stage. The rice classification result was well correlated with the statistical data at a commune level (R-2 = 0.675). The flood mapping and affected rice estimation results are useful to provide local governments with valuable information for flooding mitigation and post-flooding compensation and restoration.

J	Seyoum, WM				Seyoum, Wondwosen M.			Characterizing water storage trends and regional climate influence using GRACE observation and satellite altimetry data in the Upper Blue Nile River Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Climate variability along with increase in the demand for water resources highlights the need for better understanding of the link between regional climate and terrestrial water storage. This paper examined the variation of terrestrial water storage in relation to climatic influences over the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) River Basin from GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA), satellite altimetry, rainfall, and Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) anomaly data. Although there is no statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) long-term trend in terrestrial water variation and rainfall in the basin (lake storage, TWSA, and rainfall, p-value = 0.45, 0.48, and 0.55, respectively), in the last decade, two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004, and 2009 and 2010, which resulted in water deficit in the basin, where below average rainfall, TWSA, and lake height (storage) were observed during these periods. Extreme rainfall analysis from Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and strong connection between wet season rainfall, lake height, and TWSA, respectively, indicate interannual terrestrial water storage dynamics in the UBN Basin is strongly influenced by climate. Further, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences rainfall in the UBN Basin, specifically the peak rainfall season (June-September), which shows negative correlation (r = -0.62) with MEI anomaly values, which indicates that the El Nino case (positive MEI values) is linked to the dry conditions in the basin. The findings of this study, combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought, will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro-climatic condition of a remote basin.					; seyoum, wondwosen/AFU-1295-2022	Seyoum, Wondwosen/0000-0002-0299-1413; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2018	566						274	284		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.025													WOS:000449901100021

Here, we investigated the concentrations, distributions, and seasonal variations of OPFRs in the coastal air and water of Dalian, China. The total concentrations of 10 OPFRs in the air based on passive air sampling ranged from 0.50 to 20.0 ng/ m(3), while the concentrations of OPFRs in the water dissolved phase ranged from 483 to 681 ng/L. Relatively high concentrations were mainly discovered near the industry areas or river estuaries, suggesting that point sources along the coastline may significantly influence the local OPFR concentrations. Tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCEP) was the most dominant congener followed by tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), which was consistent with their high production and persistence. The air-water gaseous exchanges of OPFRs were estimated for the first time according to their concentrations in gaseous and dissolved phases. Generally, the gaseous exchange fluxes varied with sampling site and period. TCEP showed the highest gaseous deposition flux of -395 +/- 1211 ng/(m(2) d), while TCEP showed the highest emission flux of 1414 +/- 2093 ng/(m(2) d). The dry deposition fluxes of OPFRs (0.05-822 ng/(m(2) d)) were also calculated based on their particle fractions in the air. The result suggested that both gaseous exchange and particle deposition processes significantly influenced the air-water transport of OPFRs in this area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study continuously monitored PAHs in a few tropical land-based mariculture ponds, discussed their dynamic change trend, migration among the multiple media, and the relevant affected factors. Results indicated that PAHs were widely distributed in these environmental media, and the PAHs' concentration showed an obvious attenuation trend in the mariculture cycle. Wet deposition brought over-whelming majority atmospheric PAHs (92 % +/- 5.7 %) to the aqueous system, and >72 % of these PAHs came from oil combustion-related sources and biomass combustion. Compared with the natural sea areas in the same region, mari-culture ponds sediment could be changed from a sink at the early stage to a secondary release source of PAHs at the late stage of the rainy season, which intensifies the bioaccumulation of PAHs and the risk of edible carcinogenesis of aquatic products. Our research revealed that rainfall drove the occurrence and environmental behavior of PAHs in the tropical mariculture areas, while land-based mariculture ponds ecosystem affected the regional environmental fate of PAHs and weakened their transmission to the marine environment from land.

During the dry season (November-April) the lake drains through a tributary to the Mekong River. The flow in the connecting tributary completely reverses during the wet monsoon (May-October), adding huge volumes of water back to the lake, increasing its area about six fold. The lake is likely phosphorus limited and we hypothesized that groundwater discharge, including recirculated lake water, may represent an important source of P and other nutrients. To address this question, we surveyed hundreds of kilometers of the lake for natural Rn-222 (radon), temperature, conductivity, GPS coordinates and water depth. All major inorganic nutrients and phosphorus species were evaluated by systematic sampling throughout the lake. Results showed that there were radon hotspots, all at the boundaries between the permanent lake and the floodplain, indicating likely groundwater inputs. A radon mass balance model indicates that the groundwater flow to Tonle Sap Lake is approximately 10 km(3)/yr, about 25% as large as the floodwaters entering from the Mekong River during the wet monsoon. Our results suggest that the groundwater-derived dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) contribution to Tonle Sap is more than 30% of the average inflows from all natural sources. Since the productivity of the lake appears to be phosphorus limited, this finding suggests that the role of groundwater is significant for Tonle Sap Lake and perhaps for other flood pulse systems worldwide.

How this affects greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is moot, with both increased and reduced GHG emissions hypothesised. Here, weekly estimations of GHG emissions, over the growing season from May to September, were combined with temperature and oxygen profiles of an 11 ha temperate shallow lake to investigate how thermal stratification shapes GHG emissions. There were three main stratification periods with profound anoxia occurring in the bottom waters upon isolation from the atmosphere. Average diffusive emissions of methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) were larger and more variable in the stratified phase, whereas carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) was on average lower, though these differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, there was a significant order of magnitude increase in CH 4 ebullition in the stratified phase. Furthermore, at the end of the period of stratification, there was a large efflux of CH 4 and CO 2 as the lake mixed. Two relatively isolated turnover events were estimated to have released the majority of the CH 4 emitted between May and September. These results demonstrate how stratification patterns can shape GHG emissions and highlight the role of turnover emissions and the need for high-frequency measurements of GHG emissions, which are required to accurately characterise emissions, particularly from temporarily stratifying lakes.					bucak, tuba/AAR-6109-2020; Søndergaard, Martin/J-2478-2013; Audet, Joachim/JAZ-0745-2023; Audet, Joachim/I-7461-2013; levi, eti/H-7858-2016; Davidson, Thomas/C-6542-2011	Davidson, Thomas/0000-0003-2326-1564; Audet, Joachim/0000-0001-5839-8793; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; levi, eti/0000-0001-9038-7285; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				JAN 3	2024	21	1					93	107		10.5194/bg-21-93-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-93-2024													WOS:001168853700001

Quantifying changes in flooding and habitats in the Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) caused by water infrastructure development and climate change in the Mekong Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The economic value of the Tonle Sap Lake Floodplain to Cambodia is arguably among the highest provided to a nation by a single ecosystem around the world. Nonetheless, the Mekong River Basin is changing rapidly due to accelerating water infrastructure development (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, and water supply) and climate change, bringing considerable modifications to the flood pulse of the Tonle Sap Lake in the foreseeable future. This paper presents research conducted to determine how the historical flooding regime, together with human action, influenced landscape patterns of habitats in the Tonle Sap Lake, and how these habitats might shift as a result of hydrological changes. Maps of water depth, annual flood duration, and flood frequency were created for recent historical hydrological conditions and for simulated future scenarios of water infrastructure development and climate change. Relationships were then established between the historical flood maps and land cover, and these were subsequently applied to assess potential changes to habitat cover in future decades. Five habitat groups were clearly distinguishable based on flood regime, physiognomic patterns, and human activity: (1) Open water, flooded for 12 months in an average hydrological year; (2) Gallery forest, with flood duration of 9 months annually; (3) Seasonally flooded habitats, flooded 5-8 months and dominated by shrublands and grasslands; (4) transitional habitats, flooded 1-5 months and dominated by abandoned agricultural fields, receding rice/floating rice, and lowland grasslands; and (5) Rainfed habitats, flooded up to 1 month and consisting mainly of wet season rice fields and village crops. It was found that water infrastructure development could increase the area of open water (+18 to +21%) and the area of rainfed habitats (+10 to +14%), while reducing the area covered with seasonally flooded habitats (-13 to -22%) and gallery forest (-75 to -83%). Habitat cover shifts as a result of climate change include a net increase of open water (2-21%), as well as a reduction of rainfed habitats by 2-5% and seasonally flooded habitats by 5-11%. Findings from this study will help guide on-going and future conservation and restoration efforts throughout this unique and critical ecosystem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Efficient management of algal blooms necessitates a comprehensive analysis of their spatiotemporal distribution characteristics. Therefore, this study aims to develop a chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estimation model based on high-resolution satellite remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors and multiple linear regression. The multiple linear regression (MLR) models were constructed using multiple reflectance-based variables that were collected over 2 years (2021-2022) in an estuarine reservoir. A total of 21 significant input variables were selected by backward elimination from the 2-4 band algorithms as employed in previous Chl-a estimation studies, along with the Sentinel-2 B1-B8A wavelength ratio. The developed algorithm exhibited a coefficient of determination of 0.65. Spatiotemporal variations in Chl-a concentration generated by the algorithm reflected the movement of high Chl-a concentration zones within the body of water. Through this analysis, it turned out that Sentinel-2-based spectral images were applicable to a small-scale reservoir which is relatively long and narrow, and the algorithm estimated changes in concentration levels over the seasons, revealing the dynamic nature of Chl-a distributions. The model developed in this study is expected to support effective algal bloom management and water quality improvement in a small-scale reservoir or similar complex water quality water bodies.					; KIM, JINHWI/ABG-8602-2021; Shin, Jae-Ki/C-1050-2017	Jang, Wonjin/0000-0002-0949-4735; Kim, Jinuk/0000-0001-7815-3400; Park, Yongeun/0000-0002-1959-0843; Kim, SeongJoon/0000-0002-9729-9373; Shin, Jae-Ki/0000-0002-5380-5078; Chon, Kangmin/0000-0003-2151-5209														2072-4292				JAN	2024	16	2							315	10.3390/rs16020315	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16020315													WOS:001151416800001

Occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface waters: analytical method development and environmental risk assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY					14th Symposium on Chemistry and Fate of Modern Pesticides	SEP, 2014	Ioannina, GREECE					The present work illustrates the development of an analytical method, based on offline solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-electron spray ionisation-single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for the simultaneous determination of pharmaceuticals belonging to various therapeutic classes (analgesics/anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, antibiotics, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, psychomotor stimulants, glucocorticoid steroids, disinfectants, beta-blockers, H2 receptor antagonists and oestrogens) in surface waters. The method developed was applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical residues in surface waters from different sampling points along the aquatic systems of Lake Pamvotis and the River Kalamas, close to the city of Ioannina (Epirus, Greece), while the monitoring programme was carried out during the four seasons of the year. According to the results obtained, the majority of the compounds were detected in discrepant concentrations. The concentrations for all the compounds ranged from levels below quantification limit to 3506ng/L, with caffeine and salicylic acid being the ubiquitous compounds. The results of the monitoring contributed substantially to the knowledge on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in Greece and more specifically in surface waters of the region of Epirus. Regarding the environmental risk due to the presence of target compounds in surface waters, this was estimated calculating risk quotients (RQs) for different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish). The results denoted a possible threat for the aquatic environment, rendering in this way the RQ method as a helpful tool for a first approach. Extensive study is needed for triclosan, salicylic acid, sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin in order to better correlate their occurrence and potential toxic effects in aquatic life and humans.

A dual isotope approach (delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-) was applied to identify diffused NO3- inputs in a stream in an agricultural field at the basin in 2013. The site-specific isotopic characteristics of five NO3- sources (atmospheric deposition, AD; NO3- derived from soil organic matter nitrification, NS; NO3- derived from chemical fertilizer nitrification, NF; groundwater, GW; and manure and sewage, M&S) were identified. NO3- concentrations in the stream during the rainy season [mean +/- standard deviation (SD) = 2.5 +/- 0.4 mg/L] were lower than those during the dry season (mean +/- SD = 4.0 +/- 0.5 mg/L), whereas the delta O-18-NO3- values during the rainy season (mean +/- SD = + 12.3 +/- 3.6 parts per thousand) were higher than those during the dry season (mean +/- SD = + 0.9 +/- 1.9 parts per thousand). Both chemical and isotopic characteristics indicated that mixing with atmospheric NO3- resulted in the high delta O-18 values during the rainy season, whereas NS and M&S were the dominant NO3- sources during the dry season. A Bayesian model was used to determine the contribution of each NO3- source to total stream NO3-. Results showed that reduced N nitrification in soil zones (including soil organic matter and fertilizer) was the main NO3- source throughout the year. M&S contributed more NO3- during the dry season (22.4%) than during the rainy season (17.8%). AD generated substantial amounts of NO3- in May (18.4%), June (29.8%), and July (24.5%). With the assessment of temporal variation of diffused NO3- sources in agricultural field, improved agricultural management practices can be implemented to protect the water resource and avoid further water quality deterioration in Taihu Lake Basin.

Seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes on an East Antarctic outlet glacier	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Supraglacial lakes are known to influence ice melt and ice flow on the Greenland ice sheet and potentially cause ice shelf disintegration on the Antarctic Peninsula. In East Antarctica, however, our understanding of their behavior and impact is more limited. Using >150 optical satellite images and meteorological records from 2000 to 2013, we provide the first multiyear analysis of lake evolution on Langhovde Glacier, Dronning Maud Land (69 degrees 11S, 39 degrees 32E). We mapped 7990 lakes and 855 surface channels up to 18.1km inland (similar to 670mabove sea level) from the grounding line and document three pathways of lake demise: (i) refreezing, (ii) drainage to the englacial/subglacial environment (on the floating ice), and (iii) overflow into surface channels (on both the floating and grounded ice). The parallels between these mechanisms, and those observed on Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula, suggest that lakes may similarly affect rates and patterns of ice melt, ice flow, and ice shelf disintegration in East Antarctica.					; Jamieson, Stewart/B-8330-2013; Stokes, Chris/A-1957-2011; Leeson, Amber/JFA-1001-2023	Leeson, Amber/0000-0001-8720-9808; Jamieson, Stewart/0000-0002-9036-2317; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-3355-1573; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2016	43	16					8563	8571		10.1002/2016GL069511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL069511													WOS:000384443800028

G.; Jackson, Donald A.; Gilbert, Benjamin			Biodiversity patterns diverge along geographic temperature gradients	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Models applying space-for-time substitution, including those projecting ecological responses to climate change, generally assume an elevational and latitudinal equivalence that is rarely tested. However, a mismatch may lead to different capacities for providing climatic refuge to dispersing species. We compiled community data on zooplankton, ectothermic animals that form the consumer basis of most aquatic food webs, from over 1200 mountain lakes and ponds across western North America to assess biodiversity along geographic temperature gradients spanning nearly 3750 m elevation and 30 degrees latitude. Species richness, phylogenetic relationships, and functional diversity all showed contrasting responses across gradients, with richness metrics plateauing at low elevations but exhibiting intermediate latitudinal maxima. The nonmonotonic/hump-shaped diversity trends with latitude emerged from geographic interactions, including weaker latitudinal relationships at higher elevations (i.e. in alpine lakes) linked to different underlying drivers. Here, divergent patterns of phylogenetic and functional trait dispersion indicate shifting roles of environmental filters and limiting similarity in the assembly of communities with increasing elevation and latitude. We further tested whether gradients showed common responses to warmer temperatures and found that mean annual (but not seasonal) temperatures predicted elevational richness patterns but failed to capture consistent trends with latitude, meaning that predictions of how climate change will influence diversity also differ between gradients. Contrasting responses to elevation- and latitude-driven warming suggest different limits on climatic refugia and likely greater barriers to northward range expansion.

Barbosa			Making the most of aquatic animal tracking: a review of complementary methods to bolster acoustic telemetry	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Tracking the movements of aquatic animals is a primary means of understanding movement ecology and interactions with human activities such as fisheries. Despite the diverse spatiotemporal scales that various underwater tracking tools (e.g., acoustic, satellite, PIT, radio, archival telemetry) enable, there are still limitations associated with their application and ability to address diverse research questions. In many cases, supplementary methods are used to complement tracking approaches either to overcome such limitations or to optimize the data that can be collected in a study. In this review, we synthesize relevant literature between 2010 and 2019 to evaluate the different types of complementary methods used with one of the main approaches for tracking fishes-acoustic telemetry. We categorize broad and specific methods used, as well as the outcome or objectives targeted for each method. In addition to summarizing the use of complementary methods and their outcomes, we discuss how they supplement acoustic telemetry and other tracking approaches. Our review shows that using additional methods to support telemetry data helps expand the breadth of research questions that can be addressed regarding the complex and assorted factors influencing movement patterns. Doing so enables greater value in movement ecology research and adjacent fields such as population dynamics, physiology, trophic ecology, reproduction, and health and survival, to underpin management decisions. This review serves as a primer and guide for bolstering data collection and multidisciplinary research within the growing field of movement ecology.

India, as a fast-developing country, is not an exception. The surface water quality has deteriorated due to anthropogenic activi-ties. Another factor which impacts the water quality is the heavy rainfall during monsoon season. To maintain the qual-ity and the sustainability of water resources, there is the need to study how human activities impact water quality. We hypothesized that the water quality can be impacted by the spatial land use types and by the seasonality. In the present study, seasonal and spatial water quality regarding physical, chemical, and biological parameters from a lake cascading system was assessed monthly from July to December 2019. Land use/cover data was produced by Impact Observatory, Microsoft, and Esri based on the 10-m Sentinel-2 images. Redundancy analysis was applied to investigate the relation-ship between land use/cover data and water quality in the riparian of 500 and 1000 m to the lakes. Our results showed clear temporal and spatial variation of water quality in 2019, with better water quality in rainy season (Oct.-Dec.) and downstream lakes while relatively worse water quality was recorded in dry season (Jul.-Sep.) and upstream lakes. The water quality variation was explained 27.8 % and 42.7 % by the land use types within 500 m and 1000 m buffer widths, respectively. The outlet of the catchment showed exceptional results due to the impact of a dumpsite. Our find-ings indicate that the water quality is highly impacted by human-induced land use/cover. The land use/cover types, such as crops, woodland and urban area, show negative impacts and relate to the high level of nutrient concentrations. In opposite, grass land shows positive effects and leads to better water quality. Our study confirms that the lake water quality is distinguished in both spatial and seasonal aspects. Monsoon season improves the water quality.					; Nambi, Indu/D-4800-2012; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/C-6313-2011; zhang, zhenyu/HOA-8440-2023; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola Fohrer/C-6313-2011; Rosado, Daniel/KWT-7418-2024	Rosado, Daniel/0000-0001-6893-7324; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/0000-0002-7456-6301; Loose, Lukas Paul/0009-0005-4627-9283; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 1	2023	858		3						159924	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159924		NOV 2022						36356775					WOS:000898816900004

Seasonal variations in export of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria in runoff from an agricultural watershed in Iowa	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Seasonal variations of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) indicators in runoff water can help improve our understanding of AMR sources and transport within an agricultural watershed. This study aimed to monitor multiple areas throughout the Black Hawk Lake (BHL) watershed (5324 ha) in central Iowa during 2017 and 2018 that consists of both swine and cattle feeding operations as well as known areas with manure application. The measured indicators included plate counts for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) E. coli, Enterococcus, antibiotic resistant fecal indicator bacteria (ARBs) tylosin resistant Enterococcus, tetracycline resistant Enterococcus, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs): ermB, ermF (macrolide), tetA, tetM, tetO, tetW (tetracycline), sul1, sul2 (sulfonamide), aadA2 (aminoglycoside), vgaA, and vgaB (pleuromutilin). Both the plate count and the ARG analyses showed seasonal trends. Plate counts were significantly greater during the growing season, while the ARGs were greater in the pre-planting and post-harvest seasons (Wilcoxon Rank-SumTest p < 0.05). The ermB gene concentration was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with E. coli and Enterococcus concentrations in 2017, suggesting a potential use of this ARG as an indicator of environmental AMR and human health risk. Flow rate was not a significant contributor to annual variations in bacteria and AMR indicators. Based on observed seasonal patterns, we concluded that manure application was the likely contributor to elevated ARG indicators observed in the BHL watershed, while the driver of elevated ARB indictors in the growing season can only be speculated. Understanding AMR export patterns in agricultural watersheds provides public health officials knowledge of seasonal periods of higher AMR load to recreational waters. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-four hour air samples were collected at six sites (two urban, two rural, and two remote) in 2015. The concentrations of 15 CUPs, including nine pyrethroid insecticides, four herbicides, one organophosphate insecticide, and one fungicide, were measured. The total CUPs concentrations were higher at the urban sites (0.38-1760 pg/m(3)) than at the rural and remote sites (0.07-530 pg/m(3)). The most abundant CUPs were pyrethroid insecticides at the urban sites. The levels of the other CUPs did not vary much among the six sites, except at the most remote site at Eagle Harbor, where the levels were significantly lower. Chlorothalonil was the most frequently detected CUP, which was detected in more than 76% of the samples. The atmospheric concentrations of total pyrethroid insecticides and total herbicides were correlated with local human population and developed land use. Significantly higher concentrations of most CUPs were observed in the warmer months than in the colder months at all sites. In addition to agricultural applications, which occur during the warmer months, the CUPs atmospheric concentrations may also be influenced by nonagricultural activities and the urban development.

Although the hydrological and geophysical impacts of water relocation are usually assessed prior to impoundment, their accuracy is generally limited due to the lack of in situ observations, especially in a remote area. This study presents a workflow to quantify the terrestrial water storage change ( TWS) and land subsidence induced by a reservoir's water impoundment using multiple satellite observations (GRACE, Landsat), land surface models (CABLE, GLDAS, NCEP, ECMWF), and GPS data. The study site is the Bakun Dam, located in Sarawak, Malaysia, which is the largest hydropower dam in Southeast Asia. Commencing operation in late 2010, the dam induced a change of water mass and lake surface area that was clearly observed by GRACE and Landsat observations, respectively. During the 17-month impounding period (from August 2010 to December 2011), GRACE observed a dramatic increase of approximately 200 mm equivalent water height, while Landsat detected an increased lake extent of around 600 km(2). In this paper, a forward model is developed to determine the increased water surface level corresponding to GRACE observations, estimated to be about 120 m. In contrast to GRACE, the TWS derived from land surface models cannot capture the increased TWS, due to the lack of reservoir routing algorithms in the models. In addition, the land subsidence was calculated using the disk load model constructed based on the GRACE-derived lake level and Landsat-derived lake extent; the result is validated with the GPS data from BIN1 station, located at the western coast of Borneo. The commencement stage of the Bakun Dam induces the large-scale land subsidence, which causes the GPS-BIN1 station to subside by similar to 9 mm, and move toward the Bakun Lake by similar to 4 mm. Computation of the surface displacements directly from GRACE spherical harmonic coefficient data fails to capture the subsidence feature, mainly due to the truncation error. Overall, this study demonstrates that evaluating GRACE in conjunction with Landsat, LSMs, and GPS data allows the exploitation of the gravity signal at a much smaller spatial scale than its intrinsic resolution.

In order to investigate the transport and retention processes of dissolved substances, the hydrodynamic model, Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) was applied by using the concept of water age. The simulated results showed agreement with the measured water level, discharge, and inundation area. The water age in Poyang Lake was significantly influenced by the variations of hydrological conditions. The annual analysis revealed that the largest averaged water age was observed during the wet year (2010) with 28.4 days at Hukou, the junction of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. In the normal season (April), the youngest age with 9.1 days was found. The spatial distribution of water quality derived from the remote sensing images suggested that a higher chlorophyll-a concentration, lower turbidity, and smaller water age in the eastern area of Poyang Lake might threaten the regional aquatic health. The particle tracking simulation reproduced the trajectories of the dissolved substances, indicating that the water mass with greater nutrient loading would further lead to potential environmental problems in the east lake. Moreover, the water transfer ability would be weakened due to dam (Poyang Project) construction resulting in the rising water levels in periods of regulation. Generally, this study quantified an indicative transport timescale, which could help to better understand the complex hydrodynamic processes and manage wetland ecosystems similar to Poyang Lake.

Translating the concept of climate risk into an assessment framework to inform adaptation planning: Insights from a pilot study of flood risk in Himachal Pradesh, Northern India	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Climate risk assessments provide the basis for identifying those areas and people that have been, or potentially will be, most affected by the adverse impacts of climate change. They allow hot-spots to be identified, and serve as input for the prioritization and design of adaptation actions. Over recent years, at the level of international climate science and policy, there has been a shift in the conceptualization of vulnerability toward emergence of 'climate risk' as a central concept. Despite this shift, few studies have operationalized these latest concepts to deliver assessment results at local, national, or regional scales, and clarity is lacking. Drawing from a pilot study conducted in the Indian Himalayas we demonstrate how core components of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure have been integrated to assess flood risk at two different scales, and critically discuss how these results have fed into adaptation planning. Firstly, within a state-wide assessment of glacial lake outburst flood risk, proxy indicators of exposure and vulnerability were combined with worst-case scenario modelling of the outburst hazard. At this scale, first-order assessment results are coarse, but have guided the design of monitoring strategies and other low-regret adaptation actions. Secondly, an assessment of seasonal monsoon and cloudburst-related flood risk was undertaken for individual mapped elements exposed along the main river valleys of Kullu district, drawing on innovative techniques using dendrogeomorphology to reconstruct potential flood magnitudes. Results at this scale have allowed specific adaptation strategies to be targeted towards hot-spots of risk. A comprehensive risk assessment must integrate across disciplines of physical and social science, to provide the necessary robust foundation for adaptation planning.					; Cánovas, Juan/ABG-7903-2020; Stoffel, Markus/A-1793-2017	Allen, Simon/0000-0002-4809-649X; Stoffel, Markus/0000-0003-0816-1303; Ballesteros Canovas, Juan A./0000-0003-4439-397X													1462-9011	1873-6416				SEP	2018	87						1	10		10.1016/j.envsci.2018.05.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2018.05.013													WOS:000437066600001

The empirically predicted models between algal chlorophyll (CHL-a) and total phosphorus (TP) provide a basis for managing eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs, but other environmental factors influencing the empirical relations must be considered. Here, we tested the impacts of morphological and chemical variables, as well as the effect of the Asian monsoon, on the functional response of CHL-a to TP using two-year data of 293 agricultural reservoirs. This study was based on the approaches of empirical models (linear and sigmoidal), CHL-a:TP ratio, and trophic state index deviation (TSID). Algal CHL-a exhibited a strong log-linear relation with TP on the basis of 2-year average data (R2 = 0.69, p < 0.001), whereas it had a more sigmoidal relation in terms of monsoon -seasonal averages (R2 = 0.52, p < 0.001). The linear segment of the CHL-a-TP relation aligned with the gradient of TP (10 mg/L < TP < 100 mg/L) from mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions. The transfer efficiency of TP to CHL-a based on the 2-year mean CHL-a:TP was high (0.6 <) across all assessed agricultural systems. CHL-a:TP showed insignificant correlations with reservoir morphological variations, but it decreased (<0.5) in eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems during the monsoon season (July-August). Because TP and total suspended solids (TSS) have become increasingly abundant, light conditions become insufficient for algal growth during and after the monsoon season. Light-limited conditions become more prevalent in hypereutrophic systems with shallow depth and high dynamic sediment ratio (DSR) because of the intense rainfall inputs and wind-induced sediment resuspension of the post-monsoon season. TSID reflected the degree of phosphorus limitation and the reduction in underwater light corresponding to changes in reservoir water chemistry (ionic content, TSS, and TN:TP ratio), trophic state gradient, and morphological metrics (mainly mean depth and DSR). Our findings suggest that monsoon-induced changes in water chemistry and light attenuation, which are also associated with anthropo-genic pollutant runoffs and reservoir morphology, are critical factors that influence the functional response of algal CHL-a to TP in temperate reservoirs. Modeling and assessing eutrophication should therefore take into account monsoon seasonality along with individual morphological features further.

Potential Post-Fire Impacts on a Water Supply Reservoir: An Integrated Watershed-Reservoir Approach	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Wildfires are an increasing threat in the Mediterranean region, causing frequent losses of goods and human lives. Not only are wildfires a concern due to their immediate effects on vegetation and soil, but they can also have substantial impacts on surface water quality. Approximately one-third of the world's largest cities obtain their drinking water from forest catchments. The removal of vegetation and consequent runoff increase with a high concentration of ash and sediment often leads to increased nutrient and contaminant loads to downstream reservoirs, damaging the aquatic ecosystem and threatening human health. This study focused on the post-fire degradation of surface water in Castelo de Bode reservoir, a strategic freshwater supply for Lisbon's metropolitan area (2,000,000 inhabitants), Portugal. Output data from the catchment model Soil and Water Assessment Tool were used as inputs to the CE-QUAL-W2 reservoir model. CE-QUAL-W2 was then calibrated for water level, temperature, nutrients, total suspended solids, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen. The post-fire impacts were assessed by adjusting land use features (curve number, crop vegetation management factor), and soil properties (soil erodibility) in the catchment model, considering the different impacts of fire (low, medium, and high severity). The reservoir model was able to perform temperature seasonality and stratification while a weak performance was found for chlorophyll-a probably for having considered only a group of algae. Simulations showed a deterioration of water quality at the dam wall during the first year after the forest fire. Nevertheless, contamination did not appear worrisome with regards to water quality standards likely due to the capability of the reservoir to attenuate inflow concentrations.

Observations collected from 2014 to 2016 illustrate the influences of seasonal hydrology, bedrock geology, and landscape physiography on each river's inorganic geochemical characteristics. Summertime data show the impact of coincident gradients in lake cover and surficial geology on river geochemical signatures. In the north and central CAA, drainage basins are generally smaller, underlain by sedimentary bedrock, and their hydrology is driven by seasonal precipitation pulses that undergo little modification before they enter the coastal ocean. In the southern CAA, a high density of lakes stores water longer within the terrestrial system, permitting more modification of water isotope and geochemical characteristics. Annual time-series observations from two CAA rivers reveal that their concentration-discharge relationships differ compared with those of the largest Arctic rivers, suggesting that future projections of dissolved ion fluxes from CAA rivers to the Arctic Ocean may not be reliably made based on compositions of the largest Arctic rivers alone, and that rivers draining the CAA region will likely follow different trajectories of change under a warming climate. Understanding how these small, coastal-draining river systems will respond to climate change is essential to fully evaluate the impact of changing freshwater inputs to the Arctic marine system. Plain Language Summary River inputs are important for the physics and biogeochemistry of the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean. Most of our knowledge of river inputs comes from studies of the six largest rivers which drain areas reaching far south of the Arctic Circle, omitting 45% of the pan-Arctic watershed. This has left a gap in our understanding of smaller, coastal-draining rivers and how these are influenced by the changing climate. We studied 25 coastal-draining rivers in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) for geochemical comparison to the larger, more southerly rivers. Summertime survey data show that geochemical properties change from south to north following the distribution of lake cover, bedrock geology, and glacial history. Unlike the largest Arctic rivers, however, repeat observations over the annual cycle indicate that dissolved ion concentrations are not strongly influenced by changing water fluxes in the CAA region. To fully understand the impact of changing freshwater inputs to the Arctic Ocean requires consideration of smaller watersheds that may change differently compared to the largest Arctic rivers.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				JAN	2020	125	1							e2019JG005414	10.1029/2019JG005414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005414													WOS:000538019700021

Mean concentrations of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and high densities of phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and ciliates indicated hypertrophic state of the fishponds, as well as a markedly reduced control of these microbial food web components by crustacean zooplankton. Mean seasonal densities of zooplankton varied within one order of magnitude for cladocerans, copepods, nauplii, and rotifers. Daphnia were found in most fishponds in densities up to 630 ind. l(-1) (median: 53 ind. l(-1)). While TN and TP concentrations were high, dissolved inorganic N (median: 29 & mu;g l(-1)) and reactive P (median: 11 & mu;g l(-1)) indicated possible nutrient deficiency. The fish stock index (defined as the product of biomass and square root of densities) was used as a proxy for fish predation pressure. Multivariate analysis revealed that nutrients and high fish stocks (market carp, carp fry, and/or undesirable small planktivorous fishes) were the main driving forces shaping the fishpond plankton. The resulting trophic structure thus severely reduced the herbivorous zooplankton-fish link during a vegetation season.

Contrasting hydrological and thermal intensities determine seasonal lake-level variations - a case study at Paiku Co on the southern Tibetan Plateau	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Evaporation from hydrologically closed lakes is one of the largest components of the lake water budget; however, its effects on seasonal lake-level variations remain unclear on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to a lack of comprehensive observations. In this study, weekly lake evaporation and its effects on seasonal lake-level variations are investigated at Paiku Co on the southern TP using in situ observations of thermal structure and hydrometeorology (2015-2018). Lake evaporation from Paiku Co was estimated to be 975 +/- 142 mm during the ice-free period (May to December), characterized by low values of 1.7 +/- 0.6 mm d(-1 )during the pre-monsoon season (May to June), high values of 5.5 +/- 0 6 mm d(-1) during the post-monsoon season (October to December), and intermediate values of 4.0 +/- 0.6 mm d(-1) during the monsoon season (July to September). There was a similar to 5-month lag between the maximum net radiation (June) and maximum lake evaporation (November). These results indicate that the seasonal pattern of lake evaporation from Paiku Co was significantly affected by the large lake heat storage. Contrasting hydrological and thermal intensities may play an important role in the large amplitude of seasonal lake-level variations at deep lakes like Paiku Co. High inflow from monsoon precipitation and glacier melting and moderate lake evaporation, for instance, drove rapid lake-level increase during the monsoon season. In contrast, high lake evaporation and reduced inflow caused lake level to decrease significantly during the post-monsoon season. This study implies that lake evaporation may play an important role in the different amplitudes of seasonal lake-level variations on the TP.

Based on compiled data sets measured throughout the Yellow River watershed and chamber measurements on the main stem, this study investigates CO2 evasion and assesses its implications for riverine carbon cycle. Fluxes of CO2 evasion present significant spatial and seasonal variations. High effluxes are estimated in regions with intense rock weathering or severe soil erosion that mobilizes organic carbon into the river network. By integrating seasonal changes of water surface area and gas transfer velocity (k), the CO2 efflux is estimated at 7.91.2TgCyr(-1) with a mean k of 42.116.9cmh(-1). Unlike in lake and estuarine environments where wind is the main generator of turbulence, k is more correlated with flow velocity changes. CO2 evasion in the Yellow River network constitutes an important pathway in its riverine carbon cycling. Analyzing the watershed-scale carbon budget indicates that 35% of the carbon exported into the Yellow River network from land is degassed during fluvial transport. The CO2 efflux is comparable to the carbon burial rate, while both larger than the fluvial export to the ocean. Comparing CO2 evasion with ecosystem productivity in the Yellow River watershed shows that its ecosystem carbon sink has previously been overestimated by >50%. Present efflux estimates are associated with uncertainty, and future work is needed to mechanistically understand CO2 evasion from the highly turbid waters.

River pCO(2) and total organic carbon (TOC) increase downstream on the main stem (pCO(2): 528-1703 mu atm; TOC: 137-263 mu mol/L) and vary significantly among tributaries (464-3300 mu atm; TOC: 109-340 mu mol/L). pCO(2) displays larger spatial variability than temporal variability and is spatially correlated with river organic carbon across the river (p<0.05-0.0001, seasonally independent). pCO(2) is also negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (r(2)=0.46, p<0.0001). Respiration of allochthonous organic carbon in water column is concluded as an essential source of CO2 supersaturation and river heterotrophy. However, significant benthic respiration and/or direct soil CO2 transport (e.g., via groundwater, similar to 80%) exist at the same time. The temporal and spatial distribution of POC compositional characteristics and chlorophyll a indicate the dominant control of terrestrial processes (e.g., organic matter transport and soil erosion) on the river pCO(2) biogeochemistry, especially in warm seasons. Increased autotrophy and significant pCO(2) decrease (>60%) do occur in impounded areas (especially in nutrient-rich rivers), but the decrease is mostly temporal and regional (similar to 8% of the data points are significantly influenced, all from the upper reach and/or major tributaries). The paper concludes that terrestrial influence still dominates the pCO(2) biogeochemistry in this increasingly intercepted and regulated river system.

J	Bada, JL; Korenaga, J				Bada, Jeffrey L.; Korenaga, Jun			Exposed Areas Above Sea Level on Earth &gt;3.5 Gyr Ago: Implications for Prebiotic and Primitive Biotic Chemistry	LIFE-BASEL												How life began on Earth is still largely shrouded in mystery. One of the central ideas for various origins of life scenarios is Darwin's "warm little pond". In these small bodies of water, simple prebiotic compounds such as amino acids, nucleobases, and so on, were produced from reagents such as hydrogen cyanide and aldehydes/ketones. These simple prebiotic compounds underwent further reactions, producing more complex molecules. The process of chemical evolution would have produced increasingly complex molecules, eventually yielding a molecule with the properties of information storage and replication prone to random mutations, the hallmark of both the origin of life and evolution. However, there is one problematic issue with this scenario: On the Earth >3.5 Gyr ago there would have likely been no exposed continental crust above sea level. The only land areas that protruded out of the oceans would have been associated with hotspot volcanic islands, such as the Hawaiian island chain today. On these long-lived islands, in association with reduced gas-rich eruptions accompanied by intense volcanic lightning, prebiotic reagents would have been produced that accumulated in warm or cool little ponds and lakes on the volcano flanks. During seasonal wet-dry cycles, molecules with increasing complexity could have been produced. These islands would have thus been the most likely places for chemical evolution and the processes associated with the origin of life. The islands would eventually be eroded away and their chemical evolution products would have been released into the oceans where Darwinian evolution ultimately produced the biochemistry associated with all life on Earth today.					; Korenaga, Jun/B-2279-2008; Bada, Jeffrey/JRY-3085-2023	Korenaga, Jun/0000-0002-4785-2273; 														2075-1729				DEC	2018	8	4							55	10.3390/life8040055	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life8040055								30400350					WOS:000455417000018

Iestyn			Global dominance of seasonality in shaping lake-surface-extent dynamics	NATURE												Lakes are crucial for ecosystems1, greenhouse gas emissions2 and water resources3, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations4,5. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes6, 7-8, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001-2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user's and producer's accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset7. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world's population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes9, protecting lacustrine systems10, 11-12 and improving global climate models13,14. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward.

The rock-dwelling species (Mbuna) are aggressively territorial year-round and males court and spawn with females over rocky substrate. In contrast, males of sand-dwelling species are not territorial and instead aggregate on seasonal breeding leks in which males construct courtship "bowers" in the sand. However, little is known about how phenotypic variation in aggression is produced by the genome. In this study, we first quantify and compare behavior in seven cichlid species, demonstrating substantial ecotype and species differences in unconditioned mirror-elicited aggression. Second, we compare neural activity in mirror-elicited aggression in two representative species, Mchenga conophoros (sand-dwelling) and Petrotilapia chitimba (rock-dwelling). Finally, we compare gene expression patterns between these two species, specifically within neurons activated during mirror aggression. We identified a large number of genes showing differential expression in mirror-elicited aggression, as well as many genes that differ between ecotypes. These genes, which may underly species differences in behavior, include several neuropeptides, genes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones and neurotransmitter activity. This work lays the foundation for future experiments using this emerging genetic model system to investigate the genomic basis of evolved species differences in both brain and behavior.

The water samples were collected from selected 15 locations in 2015 2016 at seven different time points: in March, June, August, and October 2015 and March, June, and September 2016. MP was found in every tested sample with typical concentration at several dozen nanograms per liter and the highest level almost 1600 ng L-1 in a sample collected from the Warta River in October 2015. The other four parabens were determined at considerably lower concentrations than MP at levels not exceeding 100 ng L-1 with PP found at the highest and BzP at the lowest levels. BPA was determined at similar concentration level to parabens between 5 ng L-1 and 95 ng L-1 and CP was found only in a limited number of samples. Noticeable seasonal changes of paraben concentrations were found showing that for these compounds the pollutant release factor dominates both the biodegradation factor and the water volume factor. These seasonal changes were not observed for BPA and CP. Out of all determined parabens only MP was found at considerably higher concentrations than BPA. However, MP's endocrine properties are much lower than those of BPA posing a lower environmental impact potential than BPA. Influence of other (more endocrine disrupting) parabens is also relatively weak in comparison to BPA due to their considerably lower concentrations in the environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Though no single stability dimension used in isolation can fully reflect the overall response to environmental change, a common vulnerability assessment that integrates simultaneously across multiple stability components is highly desirable for ecological risk assessment. We develop both functional and compositional counterparts of a novel, integrative metric of overall ecological vulnerability (OEV). We test the framework with data from a modularized experiment replicated in five lakes over two seasons, examining functional and compositional responses to both pulse and press disturbances across three trophic groups. OEV is measured as the area under the curve integrated over the entire observation period, with the curve delimiting the difference between the disturbance treatment and undisturbed parallel controls, expressed either as the log response ratio of biomass (functional OEV) or community dissimilarity index (compositional OEV). Both, functional and compositional OEV correlated negatively with functional and compositional 'resistance', 'temporal stability' and 'final/extent of recovery' following both pulse and press disturbances, though less so with 'resilience' following a pulse disturbance. We also found a positive correlation between functional and compositional OEV, which reveals the potential to also evaluate the intricate linkage between biodiversity and functional change. Our findings demonstrate that OEV comprises a robust framework to: (a) capture simultaneously multiple functional and compositional stability components, and (b) quantify the functional consequences of biodiversity change. Our results provide the basis for an overarching framework for quantifying the overall vulnerability of ecosystems to environmental change, opening new possibilities for ecological risk assessment and management. Synthesis. Ecological stability comprises multiple dimensions that together encapsulate how ecosystems respond to environmental change. Considering these multiple aspects of stability simultaneously often poses a problem in environmental assessments, which frequently require overarching indicators of risk or vulnerability. While an analysis of multiple dimensions allows for deeper exploration of mechanisms, here we develop and test a new univariate indicator that integrates stability aspects under a broad range of disturbance regimes. Using a modularized experiment in Swedish lakes, we show that this integrative measure captures multiple stability dimensions reflecting compositional and functional vulnerability and their relationships between them.

Occurrence of microcystins in water, bloom, sediment and fish from a public water supply	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microcystin (MC) accumulation was determined in the liver and muscle of two omnivorous fish species which are consumed and are economically important, and in a planktivorous-carnivorous fish from Lake Egirdir, Turkey. Free extractable MCs in fish tissue samples were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with confirmation by high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA). MC-LA and -YR, were detected in both liver and muscle, followed by MCs -LY, -LF, -RR and -LR respectively. The MC concentrations varied between 0.043 and 1.72 mu g/g dry weight in liver and muscle tissues. MCs were also determined in samples of water, sediment and a bloom sample of Microcystis aeruginosa from the lake by HPLC-PDA. MC-LY and -YR were most commonly identified in water samples, with total MC concentrations ranging from 2.9 +/- 0.05 to 13.5 +/- 2.3 mu g/L. Sediment analyses, showed that MC-YR was present in samples between 7.0 and 17.6 mu g/g dw, especially in October, November and December when no MC-YR was recorded in water, followed by MC-LW. The findings indicate that water and sediment contained MCs, and more importantly that fish were contaminated with MCs that may pose an MC-associated human health risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Impact of water hyacinth on rural livelihoods: the case of Lake Tana, Amhara region, Ethiopia	HELIYON												Water hyacinth covers a significant portion of Lake Tana affecting the livelihoods of thousands of rural households. The general objective of the study was to assess the impact of water hyacinth on the livelihoods of rural households living around Lake Tana. Quasi-experimental research design was applied to achieve the specified objectives of the study. Data was collected from 413 survey households, thirteen key informants, six focus group discussions and field observation. Descriptive statistics and propensity score matching (PSM) using STATA 15.0 were used for data analysis. Results of the study revealed that crop, livestock, and fishery production are the most important livelihood strategies of the study area accounting for 99.3, 95.2 and 9% of the sample households, respectively. The average annual crop production of the households was 2629.1 kg of rice equivalent. However, the weed affected the crop production of 34.1% of the sample households through covering the agricultural land and making the land preparation difficult. In addition, the weed affected 36.6% of the households' livestock production. The impact was revealed in covering the grazing land, causing disease and/or death of the livestock and elevating the livestock production cost. Furthermore, water hyacinth was found as a reason for the reduction of fish population, blockage of fishing entry sites and disruption of the transport system. A statistically significant reduction of fish production, 45.7% in wet season and 49.9% in dry season, was generated because of water hyacinth. The PSM result showed that the water hyacinth significantly decreased the crop production (278.7-475.4kg of rice equivalent) and livestock production (0.083-0.114 TLU) of the affected households. The study recommended management of water hyacinth to control the impacts on rural livelihoods and further studies towards medication of water hyacinth cased livestock diseases and the possible ways of the weeds consumption as a feed.

Controls on Water Storage and Drainage in Crevasses on the Greenland Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Surface crevasses on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) capture nearly half of the seasonal runoff, yet their role in transferring meltwater to the bed has received little attention relative to that of supraglacial lakes and moulins. Here, we present observations of crevasse ponding and investigate controls on their hydrological behavior at a fast-moving, marine-terminating sector of the GrIS. We map surface meltwater, crevasses, and surface-parallel stress across a similar to 2,700 km(2) region using satellite data and contemporaneous uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. From 2017 to 2019 an average of 26% of the crevassed area exhibited ponding at locations that remained persistent between years despite rapid advection. We find that the spatial distribution of ponded crevasses does not relate to previously proposed controls on the distribution of supraglacial lakes (elevation and topography) or crevasses (von Mises stress thresholds), suggesting the operation of some other physical control(s). Ponded crevasse fields were preferentially located in regions of compressive surface-parallel mean stress, which we interpret to result from the hydraulic isolation of these systems. This contrasts with unponded crevasse fields, which we suggest are readily able to transport meltwater into the wider supraglacial and englacial network. UAV observations show that ponded crevasses can drain episodically and rapidly, likely through hydrofracture. We therefore propose that the surface stress regime influences a spatially heterogeneous transfer of meltwater through crevasses to the bed of ice sheets, with consequences for processes, such as subglacial drainage and the heating of ice via latent heat release by refreezing meltwater.					; Chudley, Tom/AAH-7919-2019; Dowling, Thomas/JPA-1387-2023; Christoffersen, Poul/C-7328-2013; Law, Robert/JZD-7970-2024	Dowling, Thomas/0000-0003-0569-4462; Doyle, Samuel/0000-0002-0853-431X; Schoonman, Charlotte/0000-0002-2882-9916; Law, Robert/0000-0003-0067-5537; Chudley, Tom/0000-0001-8547-1132; Christoffersen, Poul/0000-0003-2643-8724; Hubbard, Bryn/0000-0002-3565-3875; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				SEP	2021	126	9							e2021JF006287	10.1029/2021JF006287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006287													WOS:000702256600006
J	Tan, ZL; Zhuang, QL; Anthony, KW				Tan, Zeli; Zhuang, Qianlai; Anthony, Katey Walter			Modeling methane emissions from arctic lakes: Model development and site-level study	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												To date, methane emissions from lakes in the pan-arctic region are poorly quantified. In order to investigate the response of methane emissions from this region to global warming, a process-based climate-sensitive lake biogeochemical model was developed. The processes of methane production, oxidation, and transport were modeled within a one-dimensional sediment and water column. The sizes of C-14- enriched and C-14- depleted carbon pools were explicitly parameterized. The model was validated using observational data from five lakes located in Siberia and Alaska, representing a large variety of environmental conditions in the arctic. The model simulations agreed well with the measured water temperature and dissolved CH4 concentration (mean error less than 1 degrees C and 0.2 mu M, respectively). The modeled CH4 fluxes were consistent with observations in these lakes. We found that bubbling-rate-controlling nitrogen (N-2) stripping was the most important factor in determining CH4 fraction in bubbles. Lake depth and ice cover thickness in shallow waters were also controlling factors. This study demonstrated that the thawing of Pleistocene-aged organic-rich yedoma can fuel sediment methanogenesis by supplying a large quantity of labile organic carbon. Observations and modeling results both confirmed that methane emission rate at thermokarst margins of yedoma lakes was much larger (up to 538 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) than that at nonthermokarst zones in the same lakes and a nonyedoma, nonthermokarst lake (less than 42 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). The seasonal variability of methane emissions can be explained primarily by energy input and organic carbon availability.

However, temperature-independent parameters such as the ratio of 6-methyl vs. 5-methyl brGDGTs and bacterial community composition, might contribute to the high uncertainty of the brGDGT paleothermometer. In this work, we investigated brGDGT distributions in surface soils surrounding Lake Qinghai, and reanalyzed previously published brGDGT data. The results show that tetramethylated brGDGTs can be produced along with 6-methyl brGDGTs in the absence of 5-methyl brGDGTs. The additional production of tetramethylated brGDGTs related to 6-methyl brGDGTs, in contradiction to the view that tetramethylated brGDGTs are only correlated with 5-methyl brGDGTs, can potentially bias the MBT '(5ME) paleothermometer. Accordingly, tetramethylated brGDGTs were hypothetically separated into the 5-methyl and 6-methyl sets, and the temperature responses of the two brGDGT sets were separately quantified. Based on theoretical calculation, we further developed a new temperature calibration model that effectively mitigates the mixing effect of the two sets likely associated with bacterial community shift. As demonstrated in downcore applications, the new calibration is promising for brGDGT-based growth temperature reconstruction in loess and lake sediments, especially when the relative abundance of 6-methyl vs. 5-methyl brGDGTs varies substantially.

Although seemingly simple, TTE estimates from lakes are rare. In our review, we explore the processes and structures that must be understood for a proper lake TTE estimate. We briefly discuss measurements of production rates and trophic positions and mention how ecological efficiencies, nutrients (N, P) and other compounds (fatty acids) affect energy transfer between trophic levels and hence TTE. Furthermore, we elucidate how TTE estimates are linked with size-based approaches according to the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, and how food-web models can be applied to study TTE in lakes. Subsequently, we explore temporal and spatial heterogeneity of production and TTE in lakes, with a particular focus on the links between benthic and pelagic habitats and between the lake and the terrestrial environment. We provide an overview of TTE estimates from lakes found in the published literature. Finally, we present two alternative approaches to estimating TTE. First, TTE can be seen as a mechanistic quantity informing about the energy and matter flow between producer and consumer groups. This approach is informative with respect to food-web structure, but requires enormous amounts of data. The greatest uncertainty comes from the proper consideration of basal production to estimate TTE of omnivorous organisms. An alternative approach is estimating food-chain and food-web efficiencies, by comparing the heterotrophic production of single consumer levels or the total sum of all heterotrophic production including that of heterotrophic bacteria to the total sum of primary production. We close the review by pointing to a few research questions that would benefit from more frequent and standardized estimates of TTE in lakes.					; van Dorst, Renee/AAL-1081-2020; Scharnweber, Kristin/AER-8695-2022; Brauns, Mario/M-7878-2014; Brothers, Soren/AAE-9584-2019; Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023	van Dorst, Renee Mina/0000-0002-8667-0421; Brauns, Mario/0000-0002-5012-9721; Hilt, Sabine/0000-0002-0585-2822; Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2022	25	8			SI		1628	1652		10.1007/s10021-022-00776-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-022-00776-3		JUL 2022											WOS:000822011500001

Nineteen high-altitude pristine lakes from Western/Central Pyrenees were investigated on both northern (France) and southern (Spain) slopes (1620-2600 m asl.). Subsurface water samples were collected in June 2017/2018/2019 and October 2017/2018 for Hg speciation analysis of inorganic mercury (iHg(II)), monomethylmercury (MMHg), and dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) to investigate spatial and seasonal vari-ations. In June 2018/2019 and October 2018, more comprehensive studies were performed in four lakes by taking water column depth profiles. Besides, in-situ incubation experiments using isotopically enriched Hg species (199iHg(II), 201MMHg) were conducted to investigate Hg transformation mechanisms in the water col-umn. While iHg(II) (0.08-1.10 ng L-1 in filtered samples; 0.11-1.19 ng L-1 in unfiltered samples) did not show significant seasonal variations in the subsurface water samples, MMHg (<0.03-0.035 ng L-1 in filtered samples; <0.03-0.062 ng L-1 in unfiltered samples) was significantly higher in October 2018, mainly because of in-situ methylation. DGM (0.02-0.68 ng L-1) varies strongly and can exhibit higher levels in comparison with other pristine areas. Depth profiles and incubation experiments highlighted the importance of in-situ biotic methyl-ation triggered by anoxic conditions in bottom waters. In-situ incubations confirm that significant methylation, demethylation and photoreduction extents are taking place in the water columns. Overall, drastic environmental changes occurring daily and seasonally in alpine lakes are providing conditions that can both promote Hg methylation (stratified anoxic waters) and MMHg photodemethylation (intense UV light). In addition, light induced photoreduction is a major pathway controlling significant gaseous Hg evasion. Global warming and potential eutrophication may thus have direct implications on Hg turnover and MMHg burden in those remote ecosystems.					; Kortazar, Leire/ABG-8902-2020	Kortazar, Leire/0000-0002-2922-429X; Amouroux, David/0000-0002-0056-8590; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				JAN 1	2023	216		2						114611	10.1016/j.envres.2022.114611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114611		OCT 2022						36283441					WOS:000913285400003

The current fertilization rate in paddy fields of Shanghai exceeds the actual demand of rice and leads to substantial N loss. The objective of this study is to optimize the current fertilization scheme in paddy fields of Shanghai with the combination of field observations and modeling approach. In this study, N loss from a typical flooded paddy field in a Shanghai suburb was observed with an embedded lysimeter system from 2009 to 2013 rice seasons. The denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model was adopted to assist with the integration and upgrading of the observed data. During the experimental period, the observed paddy field generated a seasonal average N loss of 14.9 kg N.ha( -1) through runoff and leaching, which accounted for 5.0 % of the total fertilizer N. Surface runoff events that occurred shortly after fertilization largely contributed to the total N loss from the experimental paddy field. According to the validation test against observational data, the DNDC model simulated N loss from the experimental paddy field well both in terms of runoff and leaching. Sensitivity analysis and scenario simulations conducted with the DNDC model demonstrated that the current fertilization rate of 300 kg N.ha( -1) exceeded the actual crop demand at the experimental site. An application rate of 240 kg N.ha(-1) with the optimized fertilization time was the best fertilization scheme for the experimental paddy field, which significantly reduced total N loss by 31.6 % while maintaining the optimal rice yields. The mitigating efficiencies varied from 23.8%-37.2 % under different precipitation and clay content in Shanghai suburb. A combination of field experiments with the DNDC model is an efficient approach to optimize field management practices and transfer the field results to other regions, thereby achieving a balance between agricultural production and the surrounding environment.

Waxing and waning of forests: Late Quaternary biogeography of southeast Africa	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												African ecosystems are at great risk. Despite their ecological and economic importance, long-standing ideas about African forest ecology and biogeography, such as the timing of changes in forest extent and the importance of disturbance, have been unable to be tested due to a lack of sufficiently long records. Here, we present the longest continuous terrestrial record of late Quaternary vegetation from southern Africa collected to date from a drill core from Lake Malawi covering the last 600,000years. Pollen analysis permits us to investigate changes in vegetation structure and composition over multiple climatic transitions. We observe nine phases of forest expansion and collapse related to regional hydroclimate change. The development of desert, steppe and grassland vegetation during arid periods is likely dynamically linked to thresholds in regional hydrology associated with lake level and moisture recycling. Species composition of these dryland ecosystems varied greatly and is unlike the vegetation found at Malawi today, with assemblages suggesting strong Somali-Masai affinities. Furthermore, nearly all semiarid assemblages contain low forest taxa abundances, suggesting that moist lowland gallery forests formed refugia along waterways during arid times. When the region was wet, forests were species-rich and very high afromontane tree abundances suggest frequent widespread lowland colonization by modern high elevation trees. Furthermore, species composition varied little amongst forest phases until 80ka when disturbance tolerant tree taxa characteristic of the modern vegetation increased in abundance. The waxing and waning of forests has important implications for understanding the processes that control modern tropical vegetation biogeography as well as the environments of early humans across Africa. Finally, this work highlights the resilience of montane forests during previous warm intervals, which is relevant for future climate change; however, we point to a fundamental shift in disturbance regimes which are crucial for the structure and composition of modern East African landscapes.

Assessment of Flow Changes from Hydropower Development and Operations in Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok Rivers of the Mekong Basin	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												The Mekong River supports unique biodiversity and provides food security for over 60 million people in the Indo-Burma region, yet potential changes to natural flow patterns from hydropower development are a major risk to the well-being of this system. Of particular concern is the ongoing and future development of 42 dams in the transboundary Srepok, Sesan and Sekong (3S) basin, which contributes up to 20% of the Mekong's annual flows and provides critical ecosystem services to the downstream Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta. To assess the magnitude of potential changes, daily flows were simulated over 20 years using the HEC ResSim and SWAT models for a range of dam operations and development scenarios. A 63% increase in dry season flows and a 22% decrease in wet season flows at the outlet of the 3S basin could result from the potential development of new dams in the main 3S rivers under an operation scheme to maximize electricity production. Water-level changes in the Mekong River from this scenario are comparable with changes induced by the current development of Chinese dams in the Upper Mekong Basin and are significantly higher than potential flow changes from the proposed 11 mainstream dams in the Lower Mekong Basin. Dams on the upper sub-tributaries of the 3S basin have very little effect on seasonal flow regimes because most of those projects are run-of-the-river dams and have small reservoir storages. The effects on hourly flow changes resulting from intra-daily reservoir operations, sediment movement, water quality, and ecology require further study. Strategic site selection and coordinated reservoir operations among countries are necessary to achieve an acceptable level of development in the basin and to mitigate negative effects in seasonal flow patterns, which sustain downstream ecosystem productivity and livelihoods.

Much controversy exists about the factors that control the release of P from sediments (internal P loading). One of the main debates concerns the role of oxygen deficit (anoxia) in the regulation of water quality. Our results based on a comprehensive set of lakes worldwide demonstrate that internal P loading (IPtot) plays a significant role in water quality regulation. Internal P loading due to anoxia (IPanox) contributes significantly to the IPtot. However, this contribution is insufficient to significantly increase the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in stratifying lakes. In the lakes of the north temperate and boreal zone, this is because the IPanox reaches surface water layer in the end of the growing season. Observed water quality implications of IPtot are most likely caused by the sedimentary P that actually originates from the shallow areas. These findings suggest limitations for the use of aeration (improvement of the oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion) in lake water quality restoration. Moreover, lake ecosystem managers can benefit from our model that enables to predict anoxia triggered sedimentary P release from the combination of lake characteristics. The final decision on the use of aeration is indeed unique to each lake, and lake specific targets should be considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a sensitive area for climate change, and the lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are known as the "guardians" of climate change. However, there are few studies on the impact of climate variations on the exploitation of lithium resources in salt lakes. In this work, the collected data from Zabuye Salt Lake Observation Station and the experimental data of brine at different temperatures were employed as the research objects to investigate the relationship between regional climate change and lithium resources in salt lakes. The results indicated that Zabuye Salt Lake had abundant solar energy resources from 1991 to 2020 with the annual average sunshine duration of 3,122.4 h, the average annual evaporation of 2,579.07 mm/yr, and the annual average precipitation of 168.65 mm/yr. The average annual evaporation is around 15.3 times the average annual precipitation, owing to the short rainy season and the low rainfall. The phase diagram displayed that two lithium carbonate precipitation peaks clearly appeared at 25 degrees C, and no obvious precipitation peak appeared at 15 degrees C, indicating that a high-grade lithium carbonate mixed salt was prone to be formed at a higher temperature while lithium ions was more inclined to enrich in brine at a lower temperature. Therefore, Zabuye Salt Lake with the characteristics of low temperature, large temperature difference, less precipitation, strong radiation and large evaporation could be applied as unique lithium resources in the salt gradient solar pond, which would play a positive role in the development of salt lake resources.

Shale-normalized REE patterns of all samples display the M-type lanthanide tetrad effect and large positive Gd anomalies, but only the total REE pool shows a positive Ce anomaly, possibly reflecting aeolian and/or fluvial input from surrounding laterites. The positive Gd anomaly increased strongly between 2012 and 2013. It reveals an anthropogenic dissolved Gd source that enters the lake with effluents from wastewater treatment plants, originating from the use of Gd-based contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. Because anthropogenic Gd is a tracer for other wastewater-derived substances, such as pharmaceuticals, REE geochemistry offers an inexpensive way to monitor the presence of wastewater-derived substances in the lake, which may be utilized as a drinking water reservoir in the near future.

Storm activity and rainfall following the fires increased sediment loads in rivers, resulting in localized fish kills and widespread water-quality deterioration. We collected water samples from the headwaters of the Murray River for sediment and contaminant analysis and assessed changes in water quality using long-term monitoring data. A robust runoff routing model was used to estimate the effect of fire on sediment loads in the Murray River. Peak turbidity in the Murray River reached values of up to 4200 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), shown as pitch-black water coming down the river. The increase in suspended solids was accompanied by elevated nutrient concentrations during post-bushfire runoff events. The model simulations demonstrated that the sediment load could be five times greater in the first year after a bushfire than in the prefire condition. It was estimated that Lake Hume, a large reservoir downstream from fire-affected areas, would receive a maximum of 600 000 metric tonnes of sediment per month in the period immediately following the bushfire, depending on rainfall. Total zinc, arsenic, chromium, nickel, copper, and lead concentrations were above the 99% toxicant default guideline values (DGVs) for freshwater ecosystems. It is also likely that increased nutrient loads in Lake Hume will have ongoing implications for algal dynamics, in both the lake and the Murray River downstream. Information from this study provides a valuable basis for future research to support bushfire-related policy developments in fire-prone catchments and the mitigation of postfire water quality and aquatic ecosystem impacts.

Due to the limits of traditional cross-sectional point monitoring, a novel water quality evaluation method based on the Markov model and remote sensing retrieval is proposed to realize the innovation of large-scale spatial monitoring across administrative boundaries. Additionally, to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of TSS, a new three-band remote sensing model of TSS was built by regression analysis for the inland reservoir using the synchronous field spectral data, water quality samples and remote sensing data in the trans-provincial Hedi Reservoir in the Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces of South China. The results show that: (1) The three-band model based on the OLI sensor explained about 82% of the TSS concentration variation (R2=0.81, N=34, p value<0.01) with an acceptable validation accuracy (RMSE=6.24 mg/L,MRE=18.02%, N=15), which is basically the first model of its kind available in South China. (2) The TSS concentration has spatial distribution characteristics of high upstream and low downstream, where the average TSS at 31.54 mg/L in the upstream are 2.5 times those of the downstream (12.55 mg/L). (3) Different seasons and rainfall are important factors affecting the TSS in the upstream cross-border area, the TSS in the dry season are higher with average TSS of 33.66 mg/L and TSS are negatively correlated with rainfall from upstream mankind activity. Generally, TSS are higher in rainy seasons than those in dry seasons. However, the result shows that TSS are negatively correlated with rainfall, which means human activities have higher impacts on water quality than climate change. (4) The Markov dynamic evaluation results show that the water quality improvement in the upstream Shijiao Town is the most obvious, especially in 2018, the improvement in the water quality level crossed three levels and the TSS were the lowest. This study provided a technical method for remote sensing dynamic monitoring of water quality in a large reservoir, which is of great significance for remediation of the water environment and the effective evaluation of the river and lake chief system in China.

Despite its economic value as one of the most important oil-bearing reservoirs in the Subei Basin, the sedimentology, ichnology and paleoenvironment of this formation in the Jinhu Depression remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the ichnofossils and sedimentary facies, analyzed the ichnofacies and potential tracemakers and reconstructed the paleoenvironment of the Jinhu Depression based on cores from the lowermost member of the Paleocene Funing Formation. This formation contains a moderately diverse ichnofauna (9 ichnotaxa of the Scoyenia ichnofacies) that includes meniscate burrows (Taenidium barretti, Taenidium satanassi and Beaconites coronus), simple horizontal cylindrical burrows (Palaeophycus tubularis, Palaeophycus heberti and Planolites isp.), simple vertical or subvertical burrows (Skolithos linearis and Skolithos isp.) and plant root traces. The other complex branched and chambered burrows are left in open nomenclature. These ichnofossils are widespread throughout the three facies associations identified in this study: (1) ephemeral fluvial channel, (2) crevasse splay and (3) distal floodplain facies associations. Multiple lines of sedimentological and ichnological evidence, namely, the predominance of massive and upper flow regime structures, the occurrence of invertebrate burrows (e.g., Skolithos and Taenidium) in the lower and middle parts of the channel deposits and the dramatic changes in the color and mottling in channel and overbank sediments, indicate that the river discharge was short lived and that the water table was highly variable. The variations in the discharge and water level are attributed to the influence of seasonal rainfall. The cyclic nature of intense rainfall events and dry periods suggests that the Subei Basin was likely located in a semiarid region with a seasonal rainfall pattern during the early Paleocene. This study also reveals that the ephemeral fluvial channel is the facies association with the highest potential to yield oil-bearing reservoirs in the Paleocene red beds of the Jinhu Depression. Additionally, the influence of bioturbation on the reservoir quality in this region should be considered in future research.					; Quaye, Jonathan/HMV-2625-2023; Hu, Chenlin/IWE-2778-2023; Han, Chao/OHU-0935-2025	Quaye, Jonathan Atuquaye/0000-0002-5155-3946; Zhou, Xuewen/0000-0002-9987-3041; , Hu/0000-0003-1188-422X													0264-8172	1873-4073				JAN	2019	99						393	415		10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2018.10.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2018.10.032													WOS:000453492600027
J	Hernandez-Deckers, D				Hernandez-Deckers, Daniel			Features of atmospheric deep convection in northwestern South America obtained from infrared satellite data	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Atmospheric deep convection in equatorial continental regions is not homogeneously distributed in space or time, primarily due to surface inhomogeneities such as elevated topography and coastlines. This is the case in northwestern South America, which has particularly complex topography which, together with its geographical location, is responsible for some of the most prominent precipitation features around the globe. Although some of these features have been previously investigated in detail, others have not yet been studied, and some not even documented in the literature. The diverse atmospheric convective activity that takes place in this region constitutes a natural laboratory that can provide important insights into fundamental questions relevant for global climate. We use seven years of infrared brightness temperature data in 30 min intervals from the GOES-13 geostationary satellite to estimate the spatial, seasonal and diurnal distributions of deep convective events in this region. By doing so, we bring forward several relevant features, providing a starting point for future investigations. For example, we find that deep convective events have a bimodal seasonal distribution throughout most of the Colombian Orinoco and Amazon basins, where precipitation is known to have a unimodal distribution. Furthermore, deep convective events in this region tend to be comparable in size to those offshore the Colombian Pacific coast or over the Magdalena river valley, but with significantly shorter lifetimes. On the other hand, nocturnal convection dominates at several continental locations; one of these, the middle-lower Magdalena river valley, has been previously identified as one of the most active lightning hotspots on Earth, but its convective mechanisms have not yet been fully investigated. Another such location worth investigating is the middle Magdalena river valley, which may have strong similarities with the Maracaibo Lake area.

Both basins accumulate large amounts of methane in the water column below their chemoclines, but methane oxidation efficiently prevents methane from reaching surface waters. Here we show that in the meromictic North Basin water column, a substantial fraction of methane was eliminated through anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) coupled to nitrite reduction by Candidatus Methylomirabilis. Incubations with (CH4)-C-14 and concentrated biomass from this basin showed enhanced AOM rates with nitrate (+62%) and nitrite (+43%). In the more dynamic South Basin, however, aerobic methanotrophs prevailed, Ca. Methylomirabilis was absent in the anoxic water column, and no evidence was found for nitrite-dependent AOM. Here, the duration of seasonal stratification and anoxia seems to be too short, relative to the slow growth rate of Ca. Methylomirabilis, to allow for the establishment of anaerobic methanotrophs, in spite of favorable hydrochemical conditions. Using 16 S rRNA gene sequence data covering nearly ten years of community dynamics, we show that Ca. Methylomirabilis was a permanent element of the pelagic methane filter in the North Basin, which proliferated during periods of stable water column conditions and became the dominant methanotroph in the system. Conversely, more dynamic water column conditions led to a decline of Ca. Methylomirabilis and induced blooms of the faster-growing aerobic methanotrophs Methylobacter and Crenothrix. Our data highlight that physical (mixing) processes and ecosystem stability are key drivers controlling the community composition of aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs.

However, in many world regions, the ecological integrity of lakes and reservoirs is threatened by human perturbations and climate change. The Secchi disk depth (SDD) is a widely-used proxy representing the trophic status of lakes and reservoirs and can be retrieved from remote sensing data. Despite their potential for large-scale (regional, global) and long-term lake and reservoir water clarity assessment, the transferability of remote sensing-based models has been a major limitation. In this study, we assembled in situ SDD in lakes and reservoirs across North America (NA) from five different sources. We identified a subset of 3235 samples collected within +/- 7 days of a Landsat satellite overpass. Relationships between various spectral index models calculated from Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance and in situ SDD were analyzed. A model based on Landsat blue/green plus blue/red ratios (denoted as RGRB) was selected to retrieve the SDD of all NA lakes and reser-voirs. The RGRB model performed well during calibration (R-2 = 0.81) and validation (R-2 = 0.78, MAPE = 30.85 %). This model also exhibited stable and reliable performances regardless of the Landsat sensors (TM, ETM+, and OLI), despite spectral configuration differences among these sensors. RGRB was implemented to generate SDD maps for all lakes and reservoirs (water surface area >= 1 ha) across NA in 2019. More than 2.9 million lakes and reservoirs were mapped with Landsat OLI images, resulting in an average SDD of 3.84 +/- 1.77 m. A strong positive relationship between average SDD and log-transformed water surface area (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) indicated that large lakes and reservoirs tend to be more transparent than small ones. Latitudinal variations were found in the water clarity gradient, with maximum SDD recorded at the 35 degrees N-60 degrees N latitude and lower SDD at the 10 degrees N-30 degrees N latitude. This model can be implemented using the Google Earth Engine platform to derive SDD for NA lakes and reservoirs at annual or even seasonal time steps to assess water eutrophication variation in both time and space at the continental scale.

Water samples were collected from 17 sites spanning the entire Xiangjiang watershed from 2005 to 2016 to investigate spatial-temporal distributions and potential human health risks related to 8 metal pollutants (As, Cd, Hg, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Se). The results of spatial-temporal distribution analyses proved that most metals were below the guideline limits the majority of the time. However, the hazard index and carcinogenic risk analyses indicated that As and Cr were associated with a potential risk of cancer, although noncarcinogenic heavy metals in general and carcinogenic risk declined year by year. A nonparametric seasonal Mann-Kendall's test revealed that there were notable decreasing trends in As, Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Pb for most sites, whereas Se and Hg significantly increased in some areas over the targeted 12 yr. The results of principal component analysis agreed with those of dual hierarchical cluster analysis in the identification of pollution sources, the results of which are as follows: 1) As, Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn were mainly derived from anthropogenic activities and the smelting industry; 2) Cr and Cu mainly originated from agricultural or industrial activities; and 3) Se was predominantly from natural erosion. The present study will be conducive to optimizing the distribution of water monitoring stations and drafting remediation strategies pertaining to the protection of public health in metal-polluted areas.

We aimed to distinguish the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic local factors on patterns of fish diversity in European lakes at different geographical scales. 2. We compiled data from standardised fish monitoring using multimesh benthic gill nets, information on lake morphometry and on geographical, climatic and anthropogenic pressure variables from 1632 lakes in 11 European countries. By means of regression trees, we determined those natural and anthropogenic factors and their thresholds that best predicted local fish diversity, density and mean size. Generalised linear models were used to assess the influence of anthropogenic factors at smaller geographical and morphometric scales. 3. Local fish species richness and diversity were related mainly to morphometric and (bio)geographical/climatic variables. Larger and deeper lakes in warm areas tended to be the most species rich and diverse. Fish density was related mainly to anthropogenically driven productivity but also was sensitive to geographical/climatic factors. Thus, warmer and shallower lower-altitude European lakes, which are usually more eutrophic, had higher fish densities than cold and deeper higher-altitude lakes. Fish size increased with altitude and declined with increasing seasonality and temperature. 4. After controlling for the natural factors, productivity had a positive effect on fish species richness and diversity, whereas it negatively influenced fish size. 5. Our results suggest that macroecological patterns of lake fish diversity across Europe are best predicted by natural factors. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to fish diversity was evident only via the effect of eutrophication at smaller geographical scales, whereas no effect could be found from hydromorphological pressures. From an applied perspective, these results suggest that bioassessment and biodiversity evaluation might be most effectively conducted and interpreted locally, where anthropogenic effects on biodiversity become more apparent. At a macroecological scale, the strong effect of environmental temperature on most components of fish diversity suggests future changes in fish diversity as a consequence of climate change.

Concentrations of PAHs analyzed in the wet season were higher than those analyzed in the dry season, with residues ranging from 74.3 to 1930.9 ng g(-1) dw in the wet season and from 96.9 to 1388.9 ng g(-1) dw in the dry season. The primary contributors were 3- and 4-ringed congeners accounting for 59.8% +/- 10.1% and 58.3% +/- 9.3% of the identified PAHs in the wet and the dry seasons, respectively. Proximity to sources and locations susceptible to high atmospheric depositional inputs results in high concentrations of PAIL Diagnostic ratios have indicated that the sources of PAHs in different seasons make no apparent difference. Furthermore, a principal component analysis and multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) studies indicate that combustion sources such as vehicle emissions and coal combustion are the primary sources of PAHs. Toxicological risk assessments based on TEQ(care) suggested that Benzo[alpyrene, benz[n]anthracene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene could pose high ecological risks in this area.

But little quantitative study has been done on to what extent such measures can reduce watershed-scale runoff, particularly from typical humid tropical highlands of Ethiopia. The overall goal of this study is to analyze the impact of SWC interventions on the runoff response by integrating field measurement with a hydrological CN model which gives a quantitative analysis future thought. Firstly, a paired-watershed approach was employed to quantify the relative difference in runoff response for the Kasiry (treated) and Akusty (untreated) watersheds. Secondly, a calibrated curve number hydrological modeling was applied to investigate the effect of various SWC management scenarios for the Kasiry watershed alone. The paired-watershed approach showed a distinct runoff response between the two watersheds however the effect of SWC measures was not clearly discerned being masked by other factors. On the other hand, the model predicts that, under the current SWC coverage at Kasiry, the seasonal runoff yield is being reduced by 5.2%. However, runoff yields from Kasiry watershed could be decreased by as much as 34% if soil bunds were installed on cultivated land and trenches were installed on grazing and plantation lands. In contrast, implementation of SWC measures on bush land and natural forest would have little effect on reducing runoff. The results on the magnitude of runoff reduction under optimal combinations of SWC measures and land use will support decision-makers in selection and promotion of valid management practices that are suited to particular biophysical niches in the tropical humid highlands of Ethiopia.

Using a combination of field sampling, incubation experiments, and modeling, we show that the recurring mid-water methane peak in Lake Stechlin, northeast Germany, was not dependent on methane input from the littoral zone or bottom sediment or on the presence of known micro-anoxic zones. The methane peak repeatedly overlapped with oxygen oversaturation in the seasonal thermocline. Incubation experiments and isotope analysis indicated active methane production, which was likely linked to photosynthesis and/or nitrogen fixation within the oxygenated water, whereas lessening of methane oxidation by light allowed accumulation of methane in the oxygen-rich upper layer. Estimated methane efflux from the surface water was up to 5 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Mid-water methane oversaturation was also observed in nine other lakes that collectively showed a strongly negative gradient of methane concentration within 0-20% dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottom water, and a positive gradient within >= 20% DO in the upper water column. Further investigation into the responsible organisms and biochemical pathways will help improve our understanding of the global methane cycle.					; McGinnis, Daniel/G-1389-2011; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Frindte, Katharina/0000-0002-6801-5853; McGinnis, Daniel/0000-0002-6163-4299; Bruchert, Volker/0000-0002-8956-3840; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2014	59	1					275	284		10.4319/lo.2014.59.1.0275	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2014.59.1.0275													WOS:000339901800022

Excessive anthropogenic N fertilizer usage threatens sensitive downstream aquatic ecosystems. Although freshwater lake sediments remove N through various microbially mediated processes, few studies have investigated the microbial communities involved. In an integrated biogeochemical and microbiological study on a eutrophic and oligotrophic lake, we estimated N removal rates from pore water concentration gradients in sediments. Simultaneously, the abundance of different microbial N transformation genes was investigated using metagenomics on a seasonal and spatial scale. We observed that contrasting nutrient concentrations in sediments were associated with distinct microbial community compositions and significant differences in abundances of various N transformation genes. For both characteristics, we observed a more pronounced spatial than seasonal variability within each lake. The eutrophic Lake Baldegg showed a higher denitrification potential with higher nosZ gene (N2O reductase) abundances and higher nirS:nirK (nitrite reductase) ratios, indicating a greater capacity for complete denitrification. Correspondingly, this lake had a higher N removal efficiency. The oligotrophic Lake Sarnen, in contrast, had a higher potential for nitrification. Specifically, it harbored a high abundance of Nitrospira, including some with the potential for comammox. Our results demonstrate that knowledge of the genomic N transformation potential is important for interpreting N process rates and understanding how the lacustrine sedimentary N cycle responds to variations in trophic conditions. IMPORTANCE Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs can lead to eutrophication in surface waters, especially in N-limited coastal ecosystems. Lakes effectively remove reactive N by transforming it to N-2 through microbial denitrification or anammox. The rates and distributions of these microbial processes are affected by factors such as the amount and quality of settling organic material and nitrate concentrations. However, the microbial communities mediating these N transformation processes in freshwater lake sediments remain largely unknown. We provide the first seasonally and spatially resolved metagenomic analysis of the N cycle in sediments of two lakes with different trophic states. We show that lakes with different trophic states select for distinct communities of N-cycling microorganisms with contrasting functional potentials for N transformation. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs can lead to eutrophication in surface waters, especially in N-limited coastal ecosystems. Lakes effectively remove reactive N by transforming it to N-2 through microbial denitrification or anammox.					; Lever, Mark Alexander/C-2134-2011; Lever, Mark/C-2134-2011; Callbeck, Cameron M./O-9769-2018; Müller, Beat/J-8887-2016; Muller, Beat/J-8887-2016; Callbeck, Cameron/AAP-1076-2021; Burgmann, Helmut/E-8804-2011; Schubert, Carsten/GQQ-1673-2022	Schubert, Carsten J./0000-0003-1668-5967; Lever, Mark Alexander/0000-0002-2046-8028; Niederdorfer, Robert/0000-0003-2280-1653; Callbeck, Cameron M./0000-0001-7602-3338; Burgmann, Helmut/0000-0002-5651-5906; Muller, Beat/0000-0003-3696-9035; 														2379-5042				FEB 23	2022	7	1							e01013-21	10.1128/msphere.01013-21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/msphere.01013-21								35107340					WOS:000778088300012

Our previous work has demonstrated that both acute and chronic reproductive toxicity engendered by MC-LR can result in the decline of sperm quality and damage of testicular structures in male mice. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose exposure to MC-LR on the regulation of RNA networks including mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), piwi-associated RNA (piRNA), covalently closed circular RNA (circRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in testicular tissues. By high-throughput sequencing analysis, 1091 mRNAs, 21 miRNAs, 644 piRNAs, 278 circRNAs and 324 lncRNAs were identified to be significantly altered in testicular tissues treated with MC-LR. We performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to ascertain the biological functions of differentially expressed genes. Among the altered 21 miRNAs and 644 piRNAs, the miRNA chr13_8977, which is a newly discovered species, and the piRNA mmu_piR_027558 were dramatically downregulated after exposure to MC-LR. Consistently, both mRNA levels and protein expression levels of their predicted targets were increased significantly when chr13_8977 and mmu_piR_027558 were each downregulated. Testicular structures, germ cell apoptosis and sperm quality were also affected by the altered expression of chr13_8977 and mmu_piR_027558 severally. We further investigated the differential expression of circRNAs and lncRNAs and their biological functions in testicular tissues following treatment with chronic lowdose exposure to MC-LR. We also constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network to predict the functions of the altered expressed RNA5 using MiRanda. Our study suggested a crucial role for the potential network regulation of miRNAs, piRNAs, circRNAs, IncRNAs and mRNAs impacting the cytotoxicity of MC-LR in testicular tissues, which provides new perspectives in the development of diagnosis and treatment strategies for MC-LR-induced male reproductive toxicity.

Chlorophyll a as an indicator of microcystin: Short-term forecasting and risk assessment in Lake Erie	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We developed a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to establish a short-term forecasting model of particulate cyanobacterial toxin concentrations in Western Lake Erie using chlorophyll a concentration as the predictor. The model evolves over time with additional data to reflect the changing dynamics of cyanobacterial toxin production. Specifically, parameters of the empirical relationship between the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin and chlorophyll a concentrations are allowed to vary annually and seasonally under a hierarchical framework. As such, the model updated using the most recent sampling data is suited to provide short-term forecasts. The reduced model predictive uncertainty makes the model a viable tool for risk assessment. Using data from the long-term Western Lake Erie harmful algal bloom monitoring program (2008-2018), we illustrate the model-building and model-updating process and the application of the model for short-term risk assessment. The modeling process demonstrates the use of the Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for developing informative priors in Bayesian modeling.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Liu, Qianqian/AAP-5785-2020; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Stumpf, Richard/L-5237-2019; Rowland, Freya/ABE-3009-2021	Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Rowland, Freya/0000-0002-1041-5301; Liu, Qianqian/0000-0002-5798-2549													1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2021	130								108055	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108055		AUG 2021											WOS:000692561800006

However, composition and structure of microbial communities shaped by such environments have not been clear yet. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to analyze the diversity and composition of sediment bacterial communities from the Shenzhen river-bay system during dry and wet seasons. The results showed that sediment bacterial community structure was varied according to habitats (river vs. estuary) and seasons (wet season vs. dry season). The alpha diversity of sediment bacterial community was significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season, while no significant difference of alpha diversity was found between river and estuary. Neutral community model revealed a significant influence of stochastic processes on sediment bacterial community assembly, especially in the wet season. However, the beta nearest-taxon index indicated that deterministic processes were more responsible for the assembly of sediment bacterial community. Additionally, redundancy analysis suggested strong links between sediment bacterial communities and environmental factors in Shenzhen river-bay system, with the environmental factors explaining 63.5% of the bacterial community variation. Specifically, NH4+, pH, and salinity were the three most important contributing factors that shaped the sediment bacterial communities. Overall, this study provides a valuable reference to get insights into the spatiotemporal pattern of sediment bacterial communities in a typical river-bay system.					; Li, Meng/K-3172-2012; Lu, Zhong-Yi/AAT-9107-2021	Zhang, Cui-Jing/0000-0003-0904-5531; Li, Meng/0000-0001-8675-0758; 													0175-7598	1432-0614				MAR	2021	105	5					1979	1989		10.1007/s00253-021-11142-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11142-z		FEB 2021						33544213					WOS:000615120500002
J	Li, P; Song, Y; Yu, SL				Li, Pan; Song, Yuan; Yu, Shuili			Removal of Microcystis aeruginosa using hydrodynamic cavitation: Performance and mechanisms	WATER RESEARCH												Algal blooms are a seasonal problem in eutrophic water bodies, and novel approaches to algal removal are required. The effect of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) on the removal of Microcystis aeruginosa was investigated using a laboratory scale device. Samples treated by HC were subsequently grown under illuminated culture conditions. The results demonstrated that a short treatment with HC could effectively settle naturally growing M. aeruginosa without breaking cells. Algal cell density and chlorophyll-a of a sample treated for 10 min were significantly decreased by 88% andv 94%, respectively, after 3 days culture. Various HC operating parameters were investigated, showing that inhibition of M. aeruginosa growth mainly depended on treatment time and pump pressure. Electron microscopy confirmed that sedimentation of algae was attributable to the disruption of intracellular gas vesicles. Damage to the photosynthetic apparatus also contributed to the inhibition of algal growth. Free radicals produced by the cavitation process could be as an indirect indicator of the intensity of HC treatment, although they inflicted minimal damage on the algae. In conclusion, we suggest that HC represents a potentially highly effective and sustainable approach to the removal of algae from water systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reliable observations and process understanding are critical for projections of the carbon balance of the climate-sensitive tundra. Space-borne remote sensing is the only tool to obtain spatially continuous and temporally resolved information on vegetation greenness and activity in remote circumpolar areas. However, confounding effects from persistent clouds, low sun elevation angles, numerous lakes, widespread surface inundation, and the sparseness of the vegetation render it highly challenging. Here, we conduct an extensive analysis of the timing of peak vegetation productivity as shown by satellite observations of complementary indicators of plant greenness and photosynthesis. We choose to focus on productivity during the peak of the growing season, as it importantly affects the total annual carbon uptake. The suite of indicators are as follows: (1) MODIS-based vegetation indices (VIs) as proxies for the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that is absorbed (fPAR), (2) VIs combined with estimates of PAR as a proxy of the total absorbed radiation (APAR), (3) sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serving as a proxy for photosynthesis, (4) vegetation optical depth (VOD), indicative of total water content and (5) empirically upscaled modelled gross primary productivity (GPP). Averaged over the pan-Arctic we find a clear order of the annual peak as APAR <= GPP < SIF < VIs/VOD. SIF as an indicator of photosynthesis is maximised around the time of highest annual temperatures. The modelled GPP peaks at a similar time to APAR. The time lag of the annual peak between APAR and instantaneous SIF fluxes indicates that the SIF data do contain information on light-use efficiency of tundra vegetation, but further detailed studies are necessary to verify this. Delayed peak greenness compared to peak photosynthesis is consistently found across years and land-cover classes. A particularly late peak of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in regions with very small seasonality in greenness and a high amount of lakes probably originates from artefacts. Given the very short growing season in circumpolar areas, the average time difference in maximum annual photosynthetic activity and greenness or growth of 3 to 25 days (depending on the data sets chosen) is important and needs to be considered when using satellite observations as drivers in vegetation models.					; Guanter, Luis/B-9836-2009; Jung, Martin/ADN-0513-2022; Heim, Birgit/B-2815-2017; S, T/AIC-1764-2022; Duveiller, Gregory/A-4932-2016	Sachs, Torsten/0000-0002-9959-4771; Heim, Birgit/0000-0003-2614-9391; Duveiller, Gregory/0000-0002-6471-8404; Walther, Sophia/0000-0003-1681-9304													1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 26	2018	15	20					6221	6256		10.5194/bg-15-6221-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6221-2018													WOS:000448811900002

Similarly, they can help retain water in landscapes, build resilience against droughts and dry spells, and thereby contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification. However, there is no strong empirical evidence that shows the effects of intensification of water harvesting on upstream-downstream social-ecological systems at a landscape scale. In this paper we develop a decision support system (DSS) for locating and sizing water harvesting ponds in a hydrological model, which enables assessments of water harvesting intensification on upstream-downstream ecosystem services in meso-scale watersheds. The DSS was used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case-study area located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. We found that supplementary irrigation in combination with nutrient application increased simulated teff (Eragrostis tef, staple crop in Ethiopia) production up to three times, compared to the current practice. Moreover, after supplemental irrigation of teff, the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7.66 t/ha (median). Water harvesting, therefore, can play an important role in increasing local-to regional-scale food security through increased and more stable food production and generation of extra income from the sale of cash crops. The annual total irrigation water consumption was similar to 4%-30% of the annual water yield from the entire watershed. In general, water harvesting resulted in a reduction in peak flows and an increase in low flows. Water harvesting substantially reduced sediment yield leaving the watershed. The beneficiaries of water harvesting ponds may benefit from increases in agricultural production. The downstream social-ecological systems may benefit from reduced food prices, reduced flooding damages, and reduced sediment influxes, as well as enhancements in low flows and water quality. The benefits of water harvesting warrant economic feasibility studies and detailed analyses of its ecological impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Patterns in sources and forms of nitrogen in a large eutrophic lake during a cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Western Lake Erie experiences an annual, toxic cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (cyanoHAB), primarily caused by excess anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P). Because the non-N fixing cyanobacteria species Microcystis dominates these blooms, N availability is hypothesized to play a central role in cyanoHAB progression, as well as production of the N-rich toxin microcystin. Many previous studies focused on nitrate because it is the most abundant N substrate during bloom initiation. However, recent work implicated reduced N substrates like ammonium and dissolved organic N (DON) in promoting greater bloom biomass and longevity. To examine the relative importance of oxidized and reduced N substrates to phytoplankton during different bloom stages, we measured concentrations and natural abundance delta N-15 isotope values of dissolved N substrates and phytoplankton biomass throughout the entirety of the 2020 cyanoHAB in Western Lake Erie. The results provide the first data on DON dynamics and composition in Western Lake Erie, and suggest that phytoplankton, including Microcystis, likely relied on N regenerated from the DON pool in later bloom stages. In addition, the stable isotope data confirm the importance of nitrate delivered via the Maumee River to cyanobacterial growth and toxin production.

J	Lin, ZH; Qi, JG				Lin, Zihan; Qi, Jiaguo			Hydro-dam - A nature-based solution or an ecological problem: The fate of the Tonle Sap Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Recent proliferation of hydro-dams was one of the nature-based solutions to meet the increasing demand for energy and food in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB). While construction of these hydro-dams generated some hydropower and facilitated expansion of irrigated lands, it also significantly altered the basin-wide hydrology and subsequently impacted wetland ecosystems. Unintended adverse consequences of ecosystem services from lakes and wetlands offset the intended gains in hydroelectricity and irrigated agriculture. The trade-offs between gains in energy and food production and losses in aquatic ecosystem services were perceived to be significant but knowledge of the magnitude, spatial extent, and type of ecosystem services change is lacking and, therefore, the question whether the hydro-dam is an optimized solution or a potential ecological problem remains unanswered. In this study, as the first step to answer this question and using the Tonle Sap Lake as an example, we quantified one of the impacts of hydro-dams on lake ecosystem's phenology in terms of open water area, a critical ecological characteristic that affects lake systems' fish production, biodiversity, and livelihoods of the local communities. We used the MODIS-NDVI time series, forecast function and the Mann-Kendall trend test method to first quantify the open water area, analyzed its changes over time, and then performed correlation analysis with climate variables to disentangle dam impacts. The results showed reduced hydro-periods, diminishing lake seasonality and a declining trend in Tonle Sap Lake open water area over the past 15 years. These changes were insignificantly related to climatic influence during the same period. It is concluded that basin-wide hydro-dam construction and associated agricultural irrigation were deemed to be the primary cause of these ecological changes. Further analyses of changes in the lake's ecosystem services, including provision and cultural services, need to be carried out in order to have a holistic understanding of the trade-offs brought by the hydro dam proliferation as a solution to the emerging energy and food demand in the LMRB.

J	Niu, BB; Wang, HH; Loáiciga, HA; Hong, S; Shao, W				Niu, Beibei; Wang, Huanhuan; Loaiciga, Hugo A.; Hong, Song; Shao, Wei			Temporal variations of groundwater quality in the Western Jianghan Plain, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Western Jianghan Plain (WJHP) lies in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It has been impacted by anthropogenic activities during the past decades. The long-term variations of the WJHP's regional aquifer's hydrochemistry and groundwater quality have not been previously assessed. Sixteen physiochemical parameters at 29 monitoring wells within the Western Jianghan Plain were monitored during 1992-2010 and analyzed with multiple approaches. The confined groundwater is predominantly of the HCO3Ca-Mg type with Cl-, So(4)(2-), NH4-N, and NO3-N showing remarkable spatial variations. Correlation analysis was used to identify the origins and contamination sources of groundwater. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test revealed that pH, NO3-N, and Cl- concentrations at 27, 26 and 15 wells, respectively, exhibited significant increasing trends during 1992-2010. The increase of pH may be attributed to CO2 degassing caused by extensive groundwater extraction. Regional average NO3-N concentrations of groundwater increased coincidently with the increased use of fertilizer, which suggests that nitrate pollution is caused by agricultural activities. Abnormally high values of and SO4- at some wells were induced by industrial chemicals. In addition, the similarity of the temporal variations of the regional average of pH, NH4-N, and NO3-N concentrations in groundwater with those in the Yangtze River at the outlet of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) suggests that the variations of these parameters in the WJHP is partly due to water storage by the TGR. This study presents an analysis of temporal variations of groundwater quality in the WJHP that reveals a relation between the creation of the TGR and downstream groundwater quality. This paper's findings provide clues for measures that could be taken to protect the groundwater quality of the WJHP's aquifer. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Shallow groundwaters are inherently susceptible to contamination from land-use and surface water intrusion threatening drinking water usage. We used a large-scale snapshot data set of stable water isotopes from shallow glaciofluvial aquifers used for drinking water supply in Northern Finland to assess surface water intrusion risks and recharge conditions. This data set was supplemented by long-term stable water isotope precipitation data, Geographic Information System proximity analysis and multivariate statistics. The isotope analysis suggest that a warm season contributes about 60% to the total annual precipitation in the region. This is reflected in the aquifers isotopic composition as it represents an approximately equal mixture of warm and cold season precipitation. Groundwater isotope data normalized to precipitation inputs by line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) was used to flag the water supply wells impacted by surface water intrusions. The proximity analysis showed some of the wells may be affected by intrusions from gravel pit ponds, lakes and peatland drainage. On the larger scale, the wells in coastal areas were more likely to have evaporated water (intrusion) compared to inland regions of Northern Finland due to lower water availability and the presence of man-made structures. This application of stable water isotopes with lc-excess is a useful approach not only for recharge studies but also within water management for supply well surface water contamination risk assessment.

Impacts of (hydropower-regulated) interbasin water transfers (IBWTs) are considered self-evidently positive, although they can have far-reaching consequences for hydrogeomorphological systems and consequently river-dependent communities. In this study, the downstream direct and indirect impacts of the Ethiopian hydropower-regulated Tana-Beles IBWT are evaluated in an interdisciplinary way. The components of the framework of rural livelihoods are considered and changing contexts, resources' availabilities and livelihood strategies are analysed. Mixed methods are applied, combining hydrogeomorphological field observations, GIS analyses, scientific literature, policy documents, and semi-structured interviews with local people and local to federal authorities. Results show that the IBWT drastically increased the Beles river's discharge (with an average release of + 92 m(3) s(-1 )at the outlet; *2 in rainy season and *12 in dry season 100km downstream of the water release) and introduced dangerous situations for local communities (over 250 people drowned in the river). River bank erosion resulted in the uncompensated loss of farmland (163 ha) and the establishment of large-scale commercial farms increased the pressure on land and led to the impoverishment of displaced communities (4310 households). The project was implemented top-down, without any transparency, benefit sharing or compensation for external costs. This stresses the importance of downstream interdisciplinary impact assessments and highlights the need for decent in-depth ex post-analyses of hydropower projects. Environmental impact assessments should be taken seriously and cannot be considered a formality. In Ethiopia and in many developing countries, the hydropower industry is booming. Although dams and IBWTs can be the best solution for water-related problems in specific contexts, national development goals (such as the expansion of the electricity network) should not be at the expense of rural livelihoods.

Assessing seasonal nitrogen export to large tropical lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rivers are exporting increasing amounts of nitrogen (N) to lakes, which is leading to eutrophication. However, the seasonality apparent in nutrient loading, especially in tropical areas, is thus far only partially understood. This study aims to better understand the seasonality and the sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) inputs from sub-basins to tropical lakes. We integrated existing approaches into a seasonal model that accounts for seasonality in human activities, meteorology and hydrology, and we applied the model to the sub-basins of a representative tropical lake: Lake Tana, Ethiopia. The model quantifies the river export of DIN by season, source and sub-basin and also accounts for open defecation to land as a diffuse source of N in rivers. Seasonality parameters were calibrated, and model outputs were validated against measured nitrogen loads in the main river outlets. The calibrated model showed good agreement with the measured nitrogen loads at the outflow of the main rivers. The model distinguishes four seasons: rainy (July-September), post-rainy (October-December), dry (January-March) and pre-rainy (April-June). The river export of DIN to Lake Tana was about 9 kton in 2017 and showed spatial and temporal variability: It was highest in the rainy and lowest in the dry seasons. Diffuse sources from agriculture were important contributors of DIN to rivers in 2017, and animal manure was the dominant source in all seasons. Our seasonal sub-basins and rivers model provides opportunities to identify the main nutrient sources to the lake and to formulate effective water quality management options. An example is nutrient application level that correspond to the crop needs in the sub-basins. Furthermore, our model can be used to analyse future trends and serves as an example for other large tropical lakes experiencing eutrophication. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Patterns of Host-Associated Fecal Indicators Driven by Hydrology, Precipitation, and Land Use Attributes in Great Lakes Watersheds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Fecal contamination from sewage and agricultural runoff is a pervasive problem in Great Lakes watersheds. Most work examining fecal pollution loads relies on discrete samples of fecal indicators and modeling land use. In this study, we made empirical measurements of human and ruminant-associated fecal indicator bacteria and combined these with hydrological measurements in eight watersheds ranging from predominantly forested to highly urbanized. Flow composited river samples were collected over low-flow (n = 89) and rainfall or snowmelt runoff events (n = 130). Approximately 90% of samples had evidence of human fecal pollution, with highest loads from urban watersheds. Ruminant indicators were found in similar to 60-100% of runoff-event samples in agricultural watersheds, with concentrations and loads related to cattle density. Rain depth, season, agricultural tile drainage, and human or cattle density explained variability in daily flux of human or ruminant indicators. Mapping host-associated indicator loads to watershed discharge points sheds light on the type, level, and possible health risk from fecal pollution entering the Great Lakes and can inform total maximum daily load implementation and other management practices to target specific fecal pollution sources.

These threats are particularly alarming in poorly monitored ecosystems where resource use supports the livelihoods of numerous people. The Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia is such an ecosys-tem, supporting one of the world's largest freshwater fisheries. Tonle Sap Lake fishes are the focus of indiscriminate harvest affecting species stocks, community composition and food-web structure. Changes in the magnitude and timing of the seasonal flood pulse have also been linked to declines in fish stocks. Yet, changes in fish abundance and species-specific temporal trends remain poorly documented. Analyzing 17 years' time series of fish catch data for 110 species, we show that fish populations have declined by 87.7 %, owing to a statistically significant decline for >74 % species, particularly the largest ones. Despite large variations in species-specific trends -going from locally extinct to >1000 % increase -declines were found across most migratory behaviors, trophic positions or IUCN threat categories, though uncertainty regarding the magnitude of effect precluded us drawing conclusions in some cases. These results, reminiscent of alarming declines in fish stocks in many marine fisheries, provide unequivocal evidence that Tonle Sap fish stocks are increasingly depleted. The consequences of this depletion on ecosystem function are un-known but will undoubtedly affect the livelihoods of millions of people, stressing the need to set-up management strategies aimed to protect both the shery and its associated diversity. Flow alteration, habitat degradation / fragmen-tation -especially deforestation of seasonally inundated areas and overharvest -have been reported as major drivers in population dynamics and community structure, highlighting the need for management efforts aimed at preserving the natural ood pulse, protecting ooded forest habitats, and reducing overshing.					; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019; chevalier, mathieu/AAU-6540-2020	Grenouillet, Gael/0000-0003-3588-3694; Ngor, Peng Bun/0000-0002-3659-6577; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 15	2023	891								164624	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164624		JUN 2023						37277043					WOS:001035451800001

We measured the soil properties, SMB and bacterial community structure for samples E0, E20 and E40 (for which the dry season arrived early by 0, 20 and 40 days, respectively). The results indicated a significant increase in SMB as the dry season occurred increasingly earlier. The microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was used as a representative for the SMB and increased for the samples in the following order: E0 < E20 < E40. The bacterial 1 6S rDNA gene copy number changed similarly to the MBC. Significant changes were also observed in the soil bacterial community structure. The bacterial community structure of E40 was more diverse than that of E20, which was similar to that of E0. The relationship between the bacterial community composition and the soil properties was evaluated by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results indicated that the lead time of the dry season was the controlling influence on the soil bacterial community structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Gene expression plasticity evolves in response to colonization of freshwater lakes in threespine stickleback	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Phenotypic plasticity is predicted to facilitate individual survival and/or evolve in response to novel environments. Plasticity that facilitates survival should both permit colonization and act as a buffer against further evolution, with contemporary and derived forms predicted to be similarly plastic for a suite of traits. On the other hand, given the importance of plasticity in maintaining internal homeostasis, derived populations that encounter greater environmental heterogeneity should evolve greater plasticity. We tested the evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in coastal British Columbian postglacial populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that evolved under greater seasonal extremes in temperature after invading freshwater lakes from the sea. Two ancestral (contemporary marine) and two derived (contemporary freshwater) populations of stickleback were raised near their thermal tolerance extremes, 7 and 22 degrees C. Gene expression plasticity was estimated for more than 14000 genes. Over five thousand genes were similarly plastic in marine and freshwater stickleback, but freshwater populations exhibited significantly more genes with plastic expression than marine populations. Furthermore, several of the loci shown to exhibit gene expression plasticity have been previously implicated in the adaptive evolution of freshwater populations, including a gene involved in mitochondrial regulation (PPARAa). Collectively, these data provide molecular evidence that highlights the importance of plasticity in colonization and adaptation to new environments.					barrett, rowan/G-3906-2010; Leder, Erica/A-6446-2013; Aubin-Horth, Nadia/F-3857-2011	Leder, Erica/0000-0002-7160-2290; Barrett, Rowan/0000-0003-3044-2531; Morris, Matthew/0000-0002-5998-0168													0962-1083	1365-294X				JUL	2014	23	13					3226	3240		10.1111/mec.12820	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.12820								24889067					WOS:000338014900008

This research aims to estimate the environmental water requirement (EWR) for the rivers that drain into the wetland. For this purpose, comprehensive data were collected through physiographic, climatic, hydrologic, ecologic, and field studies of the wetland and its drainage basin. To estimate the EWR, we applied several methods including the Tenant, the Eco-deficit, the flow duration curve, the Wetted-Perimeter method, and the physical habitat simulation model (PHABSIM) and the results were evaluated based on the natural discharge of the rivers before retrogression of the Miankaleh wetland. Further, the results showed that the consideration should be given to the Wetted-Perimeter and the PHABSIM Model for estimation of the EWR for the rivers of the Miankaleh wetland given the seasonality of the rivers and hydroclimatic condition of the study area. The mean annual EWR of the rivers was estimated between 0.12 and 2.03 m(3)/s, which is close to the values of the bank full flows. The current discharge of the rivers are less than the estimated EWR, showing the discharge rates do not meet the water requirement for aquatic species of the Miankaleh wetland					Khaleghi, Mohammad/J-4456-2019; Sahour, Hossein/G-5588-2017														2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV 2	2020	10	11							233	10.1007/s13201-020-01319-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01319-8													WOS:000584445500001

Although larger water bodies such as lakes and dams have been extensively researched, rivers and their tributaries have largely been ignored. This study sought to establish the spatial distribution of mosquito species during the dry season and further characterize their habitats along the Mara River and its tributaries. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, mosquito larvae were sampled along the Mara River, its two perennial tributaries (Amala and Nyangores), drying streams, and adjacent aquatic habitats (e.g. swamps, puddles that receive direct sunlight [open sunlit puddles], rock pools, hippo and livestock hoof prints, and vegetated pools). Each habitat was dipped 20 times using a standard dipper. Distance between breeding sites and human habitation was determined using global positioning system coordinates. The collected mosquito larvae were identified using standard taxonomic keys. Water physico-chemical parameters were measured in situ using a multiparameter meter. Mean mosquito larvae per habitat type were compared using analysis of variance and chi-square tests, while the relationship between mosquito larvae and physicochemical parameters was evaluated using a generalized linear mixed model. The Cox-Stuart test was used to detect trends of mosquito larvae distribution. The test allowed for verification of monotonic tendency (rejection of null hypothesis of trend absence) and its variability. Results: A total of 4001 mosquito larvae were collected, of which 2712 (67.8%) were collected from river/stream edge habitats and 1289 (32.2%) were sampled from aquatic habitats located in the terrestrial ecosystem about 50 m away from the main river/streams. Anopheles gambiae s.s, An. arabiensis, and An. funestus group, the three most potent vectors of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, together with other anopheline mosquitoes, were the most dominant mosquito species (70.3%), followed by Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens complex combined (29.5%). Drying streams accounted for the highest number of larvae captured compared to the other habitat types. A stronger relationship between mosquito larvae abundance and dissolved oxygen (Z = 7.37, P <= 0.001), temperature (Z = 7.65, P <= 0.001), turbidity (Z = -5.25, P <= 0.001), and distance to the nearest human habitation (Z = 4.57, P <= 0.001), was observed. Conclusions: Presence of malaria and non-malaria mosquito larvae within the Mara River basin calls for immediate action to curtail the insurgence of vector-borne diseases within the basin. A vector control program should be conducted during the dry period, targeting drying streams shown to produce the highest number of larval mosquitoes.

Based on long-term time series of hydrological data from 1986 to 2015, we analyzed variability in precipitation, water stage, water diversion from the Yangtze River, and net inflow into Taihu Lake with the Mann-Kendall test. The non-stationary relationship between precipitation and water stage was first analyzed for the Taihu Basin and the Wuchengxiyu (WCXY) sub-region. The optimized regional and urban regulation schemes were explored to tackle high water stage problems through the hydrodynamic model. The results showed the following: (1) The highest, lowest, and average Taihu Lake water stages of all months had increasing trends. The total net inflow into Taihu Lake from the Huxi (HX) sub-region and the Wangting Sluice increased significantly. (2) The Taihu Lake water stage decreased much more slowly after 2002; it was steadier and higher after 2002. After the construction of Wuxi urban flood control projects, the average water stage of the inner city was 0.16-0.40 m lower than that of suburbs in the flood season, leading to the transfer of flooding in inner cities to suburbs and increasing inflow from HX into Taihu Lake. (3) The regional optimized schemes were more satisfactory in not increasing the inner city flood control burden, thereby decreasing the average water stage by 0.04-0.13 m, and the highest water stage by 0.04-0.09 m for Taihu Lake and the sub-region in the flood season. Future flood control research should set the basin as the basic unit. Decreasing diversion and drainage lines along the Yangtze River can take an active role in flood control.

Mapping the distribution of SAV species is very challenging and difficult using only multispectral satellite remote sensing. In this study, we proposed an approach to map the distribution of seven dominant species of SAV in Taihu Lake. Our approach involved information on the life histories of the seven SAV species and eight distribution maps of SAV from February to October. The life history information of the dominant SAV species was summarized from the literature and field surveys. Eight distribution maps of the SAV were extracted from eight 30 m HJ-CCD images from February to October in 2013 based on the classification tree models, and the overall classification accuracies for the SAV were greater than 80%. Finally, the spatial distribution of the SAV species in Taihu in 2013 was mapped using multilayer erasing approach. Based on validation, the overall classification accuracy for the seven species was 68.4%, and kappa was 0.6306, which suggests that larger differences in life histories between species can produce higher identification accuracies. The classification results show that Potamogeton malaianus was the most widely distributed species in Taihu Lake, followed by Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton maackianus, Potamogeton crispus, Elodea nuttallii, Ceratophyllum demersum and Vallisneria spiralis. The information is useful for planning shallow-water habitat restoration projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Climate Change Forces New Ecological States in Tropical Andean Lakes	PLOS ONE												Air temperatures in the tropical Andes have risen at an accelerated rate relative to the global average over recent decades. However, the effects of climate change on Andean lakes, which are vital to sustaining regional biodiversity and serve as an important water resource to local populations, remain largely unknown. Here, we show that recent climate changes have forced alpine lakes of the equatorial Andes towards new ecological and physical states, in close synchrony to the rapid shrinkage of glaciers regionally. Using dated sediment cores from three lakes in the southern Sierra of Ecuador, we record abrupt increases in the planktonic thalassiosiroid diatom Discostella stelligera from trace abundances to dominance within the phytoplankton. This unprecedented shift occurs against the backdrop of rising temperatures, changing atmospheric pressure fields, and declining wind speeds. Ecological restructuring in these lakes is linked to warming and/or enhanced water column stratification. In contrast to seasonally ice-covered Arctic and temperate alpine counterparts, aquatic production has not increased universally with warming, and has even declined in some lakes, possibly because enhanced thermal stability impedes the recirculation of hypolimnetic nutrients to surface waters. Our results demonstrate that these lakes have already passed important ecological thresholds, with potentially far-reaching consequences for Andean water resources.

J	Boehrer, B; Schultze, M				Boehrer, Bertram; Schultze, Martin			Stratification of lakes	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												Many lakes show vertical stratification of their water masses, at least for some extended time periods. Density differences in water bodies facilitate an evolution of chemical differences with many consequences for living organisms in lakes. Temperature and dissolved substances contribute to density differences in water. The atmosphere imposes a temperature signal on the lake surface. As a result, thermal stratification can be established during the warm season if a lake is sufficiently deep. On the contrary, during the cold period, surface cooling forces vertical circulation of water masses and removal of gradients of water properties. However, gradients of dissolved substances may be sustained for periods much longer than one annual cycle. Such lakes do not experience full overturns. Gradients may be a consequence of external inflows or groundwater seepage. In addition, photosynthesis at the lake surface and subsequent decomposition of organic material in the deeper layers of a lake can sustain a gradient of dissolved substances. Three more geochemical cycles, namely, calcite precipitation, iron cycle, and manganese cycle, are known for sustaining meromixis. A limited number of lakes do not experience a complete overturn because of pressure dependence of temperature of maximum density. Such lakes must be sufficiently deep and lie in the appropriate climate zone. Although these lakes are permanently stratified, deep waters are well ventilated, and chemical differences are small. Turbulent mixing and convective deep water renewal must be very effective. As a consequence, these lakes usually are not termed meromictic. Permanent stratification may also be created by episodic partial recharging of the deep water layer. This mechanism resembles the cycling of the ocean: horizontal gradients result from gradients at the surface, such as differential cooling or enhanced evaporation in adjacent shallow side bays. Dense water parcels can be formed which intrude the deep water layer. In the final section, stratification relevant physical properties, such as sound speed, hydrostatic pressure, electrical conductivity, and density, are discussed. The assumptions behind salinity, electrical conductance, potential density, and potential temperature are introduced. Finally, empirical and theoretical approaches for quantitative evaluation from easy to measure properties conclude this contribution.					; Schultze, Martin/D-4985-2015	Boehrer, Bertram/0000-0001-6253-6634; Schultze, Martin/0000-0003-3526-2919													8755-1209	1944-9208				MAY 30	2008	46	2							RG2005	10.1029/2006RG000210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006RG000210													WOS:000256362900001

Nevertheless, riverine studies that explore the former relationships are still relatively scarce, especially within tropical regions. Here we document the spatial-seasonal variability of CDOM, DOC and pCO(2), and assess the potential of CDOM absorption coefficient (a(CDOM)(412)) for estimating DOC concentration and pCO(2) along the Lower Amazon River. Our results revealed differences in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality between clearwater (CW) tributaries and the Amazon River mainstream. A linear relationship between DOC and CDOM was observed when tributaries and mainstream are evaluated separately (Amazon River: N = 42, R-2 = 0.74, p<0.05; CW: N = 13, R-2 = 0.57, p<0.05). However, this linear relationship was not observed during periods of higher rainfall and river discharge, requiring a specific model for these time periods to be developed (N = 25, R-2 = 0.58, p<0.05). A strong linear positive relation was found between a(CDOM)(412) and pCO(2)(N = 69, R-2 = 0.65, p<0.05) along the lower river. pCO(2) was less affected by the optical difference between tributaries and mainstream waters or by the discharge conditions when compared to CDOM to DOC relationships. Including the river water temperature in the model improves our ability to estimate pCO(2) (N = 69; R-2 = 0.80, p<0.05). The ability to assess both DOC and pCO(2) from CDOM optical properties opens further perspectives on the use of ocean colour remote sensing data for monitoring carbon dynamics in large running water systems worldwide.

Supraglacial River Forcing of Subglacial Water Storage and Diurnal Ice Sheet Motion	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Surface melting impacts ice sheet sliding by supplying water to the bed, but subglacial processes driving ice accelerations are complex. We examine linkages between surface runoff, transient subglacial water storage, and short-term ice motion from 168 consecutive hourly measurements of meltwater discharge (moulin input) and GPS-derived ice surface motion for Rio Behar, a similar to 60 km(2) moulin-terminating supraglacial river catchment on the southwest Greenland Ice Sheet. Short-term accelerations in ice speed correlate strongly with lag-corrected measures of supraglacial river discharge (r = 0.9, tau = 0.7, p < 0.01). Though our 7 days record cannot address seasonal-scale forcing, diurnal ice accelerations align with normalized differenced supraglacial and proglacial discharge, a proxy for subglacial storage change, better than GPS-derived ice surface uplift. These observations counter theoretical steady state basal sliding laws and suggest that moulin and proglacially induced fluctuations in subglacial water storage, rather than absolute subglacial water storage, drive short-term ice accelerations. Plain Language Summary The importance of surface meltwater runoff to Greenland ice sheet subglacial hydrology and ice sliding dynamics is widely recognized but poorly constrained by field observations. We present 168 consecutive hours of rare in situ discharge measurements in a large supraglacial river draining the ice sheet surface, just upstream of where it plummets into a major moulin. GPS measurements of ice surface motion record brief accelerations in ice sliding speed that follow daily cycles in meltwater entering the moulin. By comparing these measurements with proglacial river discharges leaving the ice sheet, we identify daily fluctuations in subglacial water storage that track shortterm accelerations in ice motion. These findings affirm the importance of supraglacial rivers to subglacial water pressure and ice dynamics, even in relatively thick ice >40 km inland from the ice terminus.					; Cooper, Matthew/ADV-3111-2022; Smith, Laurence/E-7785-2012; Rennermalm, Asa/I-3270-2012; Andrews, Lauren/D-8274-2017	Overstreet, Brandon/0000-0001-7845-6671; Smith, Laurence/0000-0001-6866-5904; Cooper, Matthew/0000-0002-0165-209X; Rennermalm, Asa/0000-0002-2470-7444; Ryan, Jonathan/0000-0002-9432-1512; Miege, Clement/0000-0002-1894-3723; Cooley, Sarah/0000-0001-8953-6730													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 16	2021	48	7							e2020GL091418	10.1029/2020GL091418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091418													WOS:000641974600075

Influence of environmental factors on spectral characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Inner Mongolia Plateau, China	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Spectral characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were examined in conjunction with environmental factors in the waters of rivers and terminal lakes within the Hulun Buir plateau, northeast China. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) were significantly higher in terminal lakes than rivers waters (p < 0.01). Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that non-water light absorption and anthropogenic nutrient disturbances were the likely causes of the diversity of water quality parameters. CDOM absorption in river waters was significantly lower than terminal lakes. Analysis of the ratio of absorption at 250 to 365 nm (E-250:365), specific ultraviolet (UV) absorbance (SUVA(254)), and the spectral slope ratio (S-r) indicated that CDOM in river waters had higher aromaticity, molecular weight, and vascular plant contribution than in terminal lakes. Furthermore, results showed that DOC concentration, CDOM light absorption, and the proportion of autochthonous sources of CDOM in plateau waters were all higher than in other freshwater rivers reported in the literature. The strong evapoconcentration, intense ultraviolet irradiance, and landscape features of the Hulun Buir plateau may be responsible for the above phenomenon. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the environmental variables total suspended matter (TSM), TN, and electrical conductivity (EC) had a strong correlation with light absorption characteristics, followed by total dissolved solid (TDS) and chlorophyll a. In most sampling locations, CDOM was the dominant non-water light-absorbing substance. Light absorption by non-algal particles often exceeded that by phytoplankton in the plateau waters. Study of these optical-physicochemical correlations is helpful in the evaluation of the potential influence of water quality factors on non-water light absorption in cold plateau water environments. The construction of a correlation between DOC concentration and water quality factors may help contribute to regional estimates of carbon sources and fate for catchment carbon budget assessments.

Apart from the identification of the algal species which multiply fast in response to eutrophication, phytoplankton studies concerning water quality parameters of eutrophic waters help environment inventory of such fast-growing algal species. The knowledge of specific environment requirements of fast-growing algae is highly significant in the control of toxic algal blooming and industrial utilization of non-toxic species in phycoremediation or as new bioresources for fuel, food or feeds. In this context, seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community in seven different kinds of eutrophic waters from 66 representative locations of Kerala, South India, was measured in two seasons. Altogether, 297 algal species belonging to 8 phyla, 11 classes and 26 orders were observed in the waters. Ecology and diversity of algal communities concerning physicochemical water quality parameters were compared, which enabled assessment of the ecological amplitude of several specific dominant species common to eutrophic waters in Kerala. The crucial roles of dissolved oxygen (p < 0.05), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (p < 0.01), and ammoniacal nitrogen (p < 0.05) in causing algal blooms are assessed using correlation analysis. The principal component analysis extracted the entire water quality parameters into five groups of components acting towards the cause of algal blooms. Overall, the investigation has generated relevant new information of several hitherto uninvestigated fast-growing non-toxic algal species such asKirchneriella lunaris,Ankistrodesmus falcatus,Radiococcus nimbatus,Coelastrum microporumandScenedesmus dimorphus, which are industrially useful and can contribute to ecotechnological innovations essential for sustainable development.					; Ray, Joseph/E-7320-2010	S, Dr. Prasanthkumar/0000-0001-8260-9634; Ray, Joseph/0000-0001-5045-050X													1387-585X	1573-2975				JAN	2021	23	1					259	290		10.1007/s10668-019-00579-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-019-00579-y		JAN 2020											WOS:000574108000002
J	Dai, ML; Wang, J; Zhang, MB; Chen, X				Dai, Minglong; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Mingbo; Chen, Xi			Impact of the Three Gorges Project operation on the water exchange between Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												The Three Gorges Project (TGP) is a world known project to utilize and manage the water resources of the Yangtze River. The reservoir stores water at the end of the flood season, and replenishes downstream reaches with water in dry seasons. In addition to such benefits, the TGP has irreversibly changed the hydrological process and the river-lake relation of the middle and lower reaches. In this paper, a hydrodynamic model was established to quantify the impact of the TGP's operation on the water exchange between Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River during 2009-2013. The results indicated that: the operation of the TGP has considerably reduced the peak discharge and the flood volume of the main stream and the Dongting Lake area. The inflow volume from the Yangtze River to Dongting Lake via three outlets decreased by 1.9-3.5 billion m(3)/yr, while the outflow volume from Dongting Lake to the Yangtze River at Chenglingji increased by 0.3-1.6 billion m(3) in September and 0.4-0.6 billion m(3) in October, respectively. This research provides valuable information for flood control, irrigation, and water allocation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and serves as a typical case for investigating the impact of other hydropower projects around the world.

J	Klobucar, SL; Rodgers, TW; Budy, P				Klobucar, Stephen L.; Rodgers, Torrey W.; Budy, Phaedra			At the forefront: evidence of the applicability of using environmental DNA to quantify the abundance of fish populations in natural lentic waters with additional sampling considerations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling has proven to be a valuable tool for detecting species in aquatic ecosystems. Within this rapidly evolving field, a promising application is the ability to obtain quantitative estimates of relative species abundance based on eDNA concentration rather than traditionally labor-intensive methods. We investigated the relationship between eDNA concentration and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) abundance in five well-studied natural lakes; additionally, we examined the effects of different temporal (e.g., season) and spatial (e.g., depth) scales on eDNA concentration. Concentrations of eDNA were linearly correlated with char population estimates (R-adj(2) = 0.78) and exponentially correlated with char densities (R-adj(2) = 0.96 by area; 0.82 by volume). Across lakes, eDNA concentrations were greater and more homogeneous in the water column during mixis; however, when stratified, eDNA concentrations were greater in the hypolimnion.

Reservoirs and water management influence fish mercury concentrations in the western United States and Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic manipulation of aquatic habitats can profoundly alter mercury (Hg) cycling and bioaccumulation. The impoundment of fluvial systems is among the most common habitat manipulations and is known to increase fish Hg concentrations immediately following impoundment. However, it is not well understood how Hg concentrations differ between reservoirs and lakes at large spatial and temporal scales or how reservoir management influences fish Hg concentrations. This study evaluated total Hg (THg) concentrations in 64,386 fish from 883 reservoirs and 1387 lakes, across the western United States and Canada, to assess differences between reservoirs and lakes, as well as the influence of reservoir management on fish THg concentrations. Fish THg concentrations were 1.4-fold higher in reservoirs (0.13 +/- 0.011 mu g/g wet weight +/- standard error) than lakes (0.09 +/- 0.006), though this difference varied among ecoregions. Fish THg concentrations were 1.5- to 2.6-fold higher in reservoirs than lakes of the North American Deserts, Northern Forests, and Mediterranean California ecoregions, but did not differ between reservoirs and lakes in four other ecoregions. Fish THg concentrations peaked in three-year-old reservoirs then rapidly declined in 4-12 year old reservoirs. Water management was particularly important in influencing fish THg concentrations, which were up to 11-times higher in reservoirs with minimum water storage occurring in May, June, or July compared to reservoirs with minimum storage occurring in other months. Between-year changes in maximum water storage strongly influenced fish THg concentrations, but within-year fluctuations in water levels did not influence fish THg concentrations. Specifically, fish THg concentrations increased up to 3.2-fold over the range of between-year changes in maximum water storage in all ecoregions except Mediterranean California. These data highlight the role of reservoir creation and management in influencing fish THg concentrations and suggest that water management may provide an effective means of mitigating Hg bioaccumulation in some reservoirs.

The measurements of 3D glacier velocity were similar to 17% more precise than a previous study that did not use the SBAS estimation. The velocities of the glacier were up to 58 cm/day east, 70 cm/day north, and 113 cm/day vertically. Combining these data with Landsat images indicated that movement of the glacier is sensitive to changes of Lake Merzbacher. Specifically, the entry of more lake water into the glacier during the ablation season increased englacial ablation due to thermal erosion. Moreover, ice calving begins when the lake water gradually lifts the ice dam. Calving can cause greater loss of glacier mass than normal ablation. Trying to replenish the front mass loss, the distributary accelerates and the mass loss further intensifies. A time series of the vertical velocity indicates that the glacier tongue has a huge englacial cavity. We suggest that the lake outburst is directly related to the crack of this cavity. Bursting of the lake triggers a mini-surge at the glacier tongue. The vertical velocity at the ice dam was similar to+60 cm/day before the lake outburst, and similar to-113 cm/day afterwards. After drainage of the lake, flow velocities at the distributary, do not sharply decrease because pre-drainage mass loss needs to be replenished by fast flow. Based on comparisons with previous measurements, our results indicate that the lake had an increasing influence on the glacier from 2005 to 2009. This study demonstrates that a time series of 3D glacier motion based on the PO-SBAS technique is effective for assessing the dynamics of a mountain glacial system and interactions with its glacial lake.

However, due to the monsoon climate in southern China, it is cloudy and rainy throughout the year, which makes it difficult to obtain accurate information on rice cultivation based on optical time series images. Conventional image synthesis is prone to omission or redundancy of spectral and temporal features that are potentially important for rice-growth identification, making it difficult to determine the optimal features for high-precision mapping of paddy rice. To address these issues, we develop a method to granulate the effective use interval of classification features by extracting phenological signatures of rice to obtain cost-effective and highly accurate mapping results. Two steps are involved in this method: (1) analyzing the information on various features (spectra, polarization, and seasonal regularity) to identify three key phenological periods throughout the lifespan of paddy rice; (2) identifying the features with the highest class separation between paddy rice, non-paddy crops, and wetlands under different phenological stages; and (3) removing redundant features to retain the optimal feature combinations. Subsequently, the obtained feature sets are used as input data for the random forest classifier. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the identified rice results was 95.44% with F1 scores above 93% for both single- and double-cropping rice. Meanwhile, the correlation coefficient of our mapped rice area compared with the official statistics of rice area at county and district levels was 0.86. In addition, we found that combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for rice recognition was better than using Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 alone, and the classification accuracy was improved by 5.82% and 2.39%, which confirms that the synergistic Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data can effectively overcome the problem of missing optical images caused by clouds and rain. Our study demonstrates the potential of distinguishing mixed rice-cropping systems in subtropical regions with fragmented rice-field distribution in a cloudy and rainy environment, and also provides a basis for the rational layout of rice production and improvement of cultivation systems.

Biotic and Abiotic Mechanisms of Manganese (II) Oxidation in Lake Erie	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Manganese (Mn), an element sensitive to redox conditions in aquatic environments, plays a role in numerous biogeochemical cycles. Although the speciation of Mn in lakes largely tracks the availability of dissolved oxygen, direct oxidation of Mn by molecular oxygen occurs slowly and, instead, the majority of Mn oxidation occurs via biotic and abiotic mechanisms involving microbes, organic matter, light, reactive oxygen species, and mineral surfaces. While each of these mechanisms is either known or likely to occur in freshwater, the relative balance and interaction among these biogeochemical pathways in an intact plankton system remains uncertain. We investigated potential abiotic and biotic mechanisms contributing to Mn oxide formation in Lake Erie, which experiences seasonal hypoxia and accumulation of Mn during seasonal stratification. Overall, Mn oxidation rates were much higher in the shallow and highly productive western basin (up to 1.5 mu moles L-1 d(-1)) compared to the deeper and less productive central basin, where we observed very little Mn oxidation over 7 days. Our experiments suggest that abiotic mechanisms involving mineral surfaces played a larger role than biotic mechanisms, particularly in the light where Mn oxidation was highest. Reactive oxygen species exhibited antagonistic roles: hydrogen peroxide acted as a net reductant for manganese oxides and completely masked oxidation of Mn by the superoxide free radical. These findings show that multiple mechanisms may exert control over the fate of Mn and suggest that Mn released from sediments during hypoxia can potentially remain dissolved in the water for an extended period of time. Since the severity of Lake Erie hypoxia has increased in recent years, and we are becoming increasingly aware of the health effects of Mn in drinking water sources, these findings should help inform efforts to predict when and where Mn will accumulate in the lake water.

J	Althoff, D; Rodrigues, LN; Silva, DD; Bazame, HC				Althoff, Daniel; Rodrigues, Lineu Neiva; da Silva, Demetrius David; Bazame, Helizani Couto			Improving methods for estimating small reservoir evaporation in the Brazilian Savanna	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The Brazilian Savanna biome is the main agricultural region of Brazil and is facing a growing water shortage and conflicts that tend to expand to new areas and intensify in those already stressed, which is hindering the economic development of the region. Small reservoirs play an important role in supporting the local economy in the savanna areas of Brazil. Hundreds of small reservoirs have been built in the last twenty years in the region. They were constructed by individual farmers or projects funded by different agencies without any coordination and knowledge that the reservoirs are part of a complex hydrologic system. The lack of reservoir basic information and appropriate methods to quantify water supply, demand and losses are hindering efficient water management. In this context, evaporation is a non beneficial loss to the water system and should be better quantified. The present study aimed to improve methods for estimating small reservoir evaporation in the Brazilian savanna region. The study area was the Buriti Vermelho watershed, where the evaporation were measured in Class A pans installed inside and outside of a small reservoir. Pan coefficients were calculated on a monthly, seasonal and annual basis. In addition, equations for estimating evaporation based on climatic variables were developed. The pan coefficients values varied throughout the year from 0.72 to 0.92, with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.32 to 0.52 mm d(-1). The two best climatic equations presented MAE of 0.44 mm d(-1), while equations that used solar radiation and relative humidity as input also presented good performance.

Model accuracy varies through the hydrological year. We focus on seasonal and interannual spatial variability of water circulation and inundation duration. We highlight strong heterogeneities in water velocity magnitude between the different morphological domains of the floodplain, the highest velocities being encountered in the river-floodplain channel. In addition to topography, we emphasize the importance of the main channel and the local runoff in controlling the water circulation, at least during part of the hydrological year. From low water to early rising period, local runoff constrains the river incursion across the floodplain, while the rates of main channel rising/receding controls the flood duration. The comparison of several hydrological years highlights the interannual changes of these hydraulic controls and also the influence exerted by prior inundation conditions. While we observed few changes in water velocity distribution among hydrological years, the inundation duration is highly variable. Usually defined by maximum water level, extreme flood events may paradoxically induce positive (up to 40 days) but also negative (up to -20 days) anomalies of inundation duration.

J	Tolocka, MP; Turpin, B				Tolocka, Michael P.; Turpin, Barbara			Contribution of Organosulfur Compounds to Organic Aerosol Mass	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Organosulfates have been proposed as products of secondary organic aerosol formation. While organosulfates have been identified in ambient aerosol samples, a question remains as to the magnitude of their contribution to particulate organic mass. At the same time, discrepancies have been observed between total particulate sulfur measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and sulfur present as inorganic sulfate measured by ion chromatography (IC) in fine particulate matter. These differences could be attributed to measurement bias and/or the contribution of other sulfur compounds, including organosulfates. Using the National Park Service IMPROVE PM2.5 database, we examined the disparity between the sulfur and sulfate measurements at 12 sites across the United States to provide upper-bound estimates for the annual average contributions of organosulfates to organic mass. The data set consists of over 150 000 measurements. The 12 sites include Brigantine, NJ, Cape Cod, MA, Washington, DC, Chassahowitzka, FL, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, NC, Okefenokee, GA, Bondville, IL, Mingo, MO, Phoenix, AZ, San Gabriel, CA, Crater Lake National Park, OR, and Spokane, WA. These sites are representative of the different regions of the country: Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and Northwest. We estimate that organosulfur compounds could comprise as much as 5-10% of the organic mass at these sites. The contribution varies by season and location and appears to be higher during warm months when photochemical oxidation chemistry is most active.

J	Pu, J; Ni, ZK; Wang, SR				Pu, Jia; Ni, Zhaokui; Wang, Shengrui			Characteristics of bioavailable phosphorus in sediment and potential environmental risks in Poyang Lake: The largest freshwater lake in China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Distinguishing sediment phosphorus (P) species and bioavailability is conducive to recognizing the effects of hydrological variation and contamination loading. We examined the P fractions and bioavailability in four sediment cores (N4, C1, R1 and R2) to determine the long-term effects of hydrological variation and contamination loading in Poyang Lake from 1972-2012. The results showed that the total phosphorus (TP) concentrations occurred in the following order, N4 < C1 < R2 < R1, with the highest increment in R2. Bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) accounted for 80-98% of TP, including substantial fractions of iron/aluminum-bound P (Fe/Al-P, 39%) and organic phosphorus (P-o, 40%). Acute hydrological variability reduced the concentrations of BAP and TP from the 1990s to 2000s (trough at 2002), owing to the input of coarser particles and weak absorption during catastrophic flooding (cores N4, C1). Subsequently, water level fluctuation induced by Three Gorges Dam (TGD) contributed to Fe/Al-P and most proportion of P-o remained and accumulated in the uppermost layer. Additionally, TP and BAP, especially Fe/Al-P and P-o, performed positively and were correlated with P fluvial contamination loading at the river confluences (cores R1, R2). The sediment Fe/Al-P ratio abruptly increased after 2000, originating from continuous intensification of industrial and domestic effluents. Nonlabile P-o (humic acid P-o, Hum-P-o and Residual P-o, Res-P-o) accounted for 57% of P-o and continuously increased since 1970; these substances originated from P fertilizer usage and livestock excretion. Moreover, to quantify hydrological variation, the increments of BAP were assessed at 2034.89 tons, accounting for 10% of the external P. The BAP burial flux was estimated at 251.66 x 10(-2) t.km(-2).y(-1) in R2, and fluvial contamination loading was highest. In brief, this study emphasized how hydrological variability and anthropogenic contamination loading affect the BAP in sediment, and highlighted the Fe/Al-P and P-o are the valuable objects for avoiding lake eutrophication.

Hydrogenotrophic pathway dominates methanogenesis along the river-estuary continuum of the Yangtze River	WATER RESEARCH												Rivers are considered as an important source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but our understanding for the methanogenic pathway in rivers and its linkage with CH4 emission is very limited. Here, we investigated the diffusive flux of CH4 and its stable carbon isotope signature (delta C-13-CH4) along the river-estuary continuum of the Yangtze River. The diffusive CH4 flux was estimated to 27.9 +/- 11.4 mu mol/m(2)/d and 36.5 +/- 24.4 mu mol/m(2)/d in wet season and dry season, respectively. The delta C-13-CH4 values were generally lower than -60 parts per thousand, with the fractionation factor (alpha(c)) higher than 1.055 and the isotope separation factor (epsilon(c)) ranged from 55 to 100. In situ microbial composition showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens accounts for over 70% of the total reads. Moreover, the incubation test showed that the headspace CH4 concentration by adding CO2/H-2 to the sediment was orders of magnitude higher than that by adding trimethylamine and sodium acetate. These results jointly verified the river-estuary continuum is a minor CH4 source and dominated by hydrogenotrophic pathway. Based on the methanogenic pathway here and previous reported data in the same region, the historical variation of diffusive CH4 flux was calculated and results showed that CH4 emission has reduced 82.5% since the construction of Three Gorges Dam (TGD). Our study verified the dominant methanogenic pathway in river ecosystems and clarified the effect and mechanism of dam construction on riverine CH4 emission.

Detection of the human specific Bacteroides genetic marker provides evidence of widespread sewage contamination of stormwater in the urban environment	WATER RESEARCH												Human sewage contamination of surface waters is a major human health concern. We found urban stormwater systems that collect and convey runoff from impervious surfaces act as a conduit for sewage originating from breeches in sanitary sewer infrastructure. A total of 828 samples at 45 stormwater outfalls were collected over a four-year period and assessed by culture based methods, PCR, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to test for traditional and alternative indicators of fecal pollution. All outfalls had the HF183 (human) Bacteroides genetic marker detected in at least one sample, suggesting sewage contamination is nearly ubiquitous in the urban environment. However, most outfalls were intermittently positive, ranging from detection in 11%-100% of the samples. Positive results did not correlate with seasonality, rainfall amounts, or days since previous rainfall. Approximately two-thirds of the outfalls had high (>5000 copy number, i.e. CN, per 100 ml) or moderate levels (1000-5000 CN per 100 ml) of the human Bacteroides genetic marker. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterococci levels did not correlate to human Bacteroides. A total of 66% of all outfall samples had standard fecal indicator levels above 10,000 CFU per 100 ml. A tiered assessment using this benchmark to identify high priority sites would have failed to flag 35% of the samples that had evidence of sewage contamination. In addition, high fecal indicators would have flagged 33% of samples as priority that had low or no evidence of sewage. Enteric virus levels in one outfall with high levels of the human Bacteroides genetic marker were similar to untreated wastewater, which illustrates stormwater can serve as a pathway for pathogen contamination. The major source of fecal pollution at four of five river sites that receive stormwater discharge appeared to be from sewage sources rather than non-human sources based on the ratios of human Bacteroides to total Bacteroides spp. This study shows the feasibility and benefits of employing molecular methods to test for alternative indicators of fecal pollution to identify sewage sources and potential health risks and for prioritization of remediation efforts.

The total OPE concentration in the samples was 3.02-48.4 ng L-1 (mean 25.0 +/- 10.5 ng L-1), with tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) being the largest contributor. Cluster analysis results showed off-shore input from the coast of East and Southeast Asia was an important source of these chemicals. Tri-p-tolyl phosphate (TpTP) should also be considered for long-term monitoring, because of its high detection frequency.

It was found that in both zones Zn contamination varied by season. In July and October, dissolved Zn was present in high concentrations, and in July, high concentrations of labile Zn were found in sediments. In July, reductive dissolutions of Fe/Mn oxides likely played a key role in the release of Zn, which was confirmed by both zones having the lowest percentage of the reducible fraction of Zn in July. Complexation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with Zn may be responsible for the observed increase in the dissolved Zn concentration in October. This conclusion was supported by noting that October had the highest percentages of Zn-DOM complexes (25.3% and 34.4%) in the algae- and macrophytes-dominated zones, respectively. However, in January, low dissolved and labile Zn contents were observed in sediments in the two zones, suggesting that the decrease of Zn in sediments was caused by the adsorption of Fe/Mn oxides.

Thermal acclimation alters both basal heat shock protein gene expression and the heat shock response in juvenile lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis)	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Long-term temperature shifts associated with seasonal variability are common in temperate regions. However, these natural shifts could place significant strain on thermal stress responses of fishes when combined with mean increases in water temperatures predicted by climate change models. We examined the relationship between thermal acclimation, basal expression of heat shock protein (hsp) genes and the activation of the heat shock response (HSR) in lake whitefish (LWF; Coregonus clupeaformis), a cold water species of cultural and commercial significance. Juveniles were acclimated to either 6, 12, or 18 degrees C water for several months prior to the quantification of hsp mRNA levels in the presence or absence of acute heat shock (HS). Acclimation to 18 degrees C increased basal mRNA levels of hsp70 and hsp47, but not hsc70 or hsp90 beta in gill, liver and white muscle, while 6 degrees C acclimation had no effect on basal hsp transcription. Fish in all acclimation groups were capable of eliciting a robust HSR following acute HS, as indicated by the upregulation of hsp70 and hsp47. An increase of only 2 degrees C above the 18 degrees C acclimation temperature was required to trigger these transcriptional changes, suggesting that the HSR may be frequently initiated in LWF populations living at mildly elevated temperatures. Collectively, these expression profiles show that environmental temperature influences both basal hsp levels and the HSR in LWF, and indicate that these fish may have a greater physiological and ecological susceptibility to elevated temperatures than to cooler temperatures.					; Somers, Christopher/AAE-6390-2019	Wilson, Joanna/0000-0003-4245-1304; Manzon, Richard/0000-0002-3570-3676													0306-4565	1879-0992				FEB	2022	104								103185	10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103185		JAN 2022						35180964					WOS:000761022300007

CHEMOSPHERE												The possible environmental impact of the recent increase in use of a group of technology-critical elements (Nb, Ta, Ga, In, Ge and Te) is analysed by reviewing published concentration profiles in environmental archives (ice cores, ombrotrophic peat bogs, freshwater sediments and moss surveys) and evaluating temporal trends in surface waters. No increase has so far been recorded. The low potential direct emissions of these elements, resulting from their absolute low production levels, make it unlikely that the increasing use of these elements in modern technology has any noticeable effect on their environmental concentrations on a global scale. This holds particularly true for those of these elements that are probably emitted in relatively high amounts from other human activities (i.e., coal combustion and non-ferrous smelting), such as In, the most studied element of the group.

Jeffrey			Early foraging settlement of the Tibetan Plateau highlands	ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA												We identified and dated 18 occupational events at eight sites dating to similar to 14.7-10.8 kiloannum before present (ka BP) during a decade of archaeological survey and excavation on the northeastern high Tibetan Plateau (TP) > 3200 m. The ephemeral nature of the earliest sites suggests they were created by small foraging groups during very short stays. By similar to 12 ka BP, larger foraging groups began to occupy sites > 4000 m leading to a more intensive occupation of the high TP after similar to 9.5 ka BP. This archaeologically-based chronology closely matches genetically-based Tibetan population histories showing an early growth in population size and initial split with Han populations similar to 15-9 ka BP, and a second spike in population growth during the early-mid Holocene. We found no evidence for occupation of the high TP prior to or during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), suggesting the initial separation of Tibetan and Han populations may have occurred at lower elevations in the TP margins or after the LGM in the high TP.

Toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms from the reservoir Valle de Bravo (Mexico): A case study on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Proliferating cyanobacterial blooms due eutrophication in reservoirs is a major global problem. The production of cyanotoxins often increases with grazing pressure and temperature while the sensitivity of zooplankton to cyanotoxins is directly related to temperature. Here we evaluate the effect of different concentrations of the crude extract of cyanobacteria from Valle de Bravo reservoir during dry (January) and rainy (September) seasons at 20 and 25 degrees C on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus based on acute and chronic toxicity tests. We filtered 20 or 1501 of lake water, depending on the intensity of the bloom, and estimated the density and diversity of the cyanobacteria. The crude extracts, after 5 cycles of freezing, thawing and sonication at 14 MHz, were filtered and the microcystin concentration quantified based on ELISA. The extracts were used to conduct the acute and chronic toxicity tests, all in quadruplicate. Acute toxicity tests were based on 24 h mortality. Chronic toxicity tests (population growth and life table experiments) were conducted at 5 and 10% of the median lethal concentration. The field samples were dominated by Microcystis sp. (January) or Woronichinia naegeliana (September). The microcystin concentration in lake water was 9.57 mu g/l and 0.097 mu g/l and the median lethal concentration was 5.34 mu g microcystin/L and 035 mu g microcystin/L in January and September, respectively. Survival and reproduction of B. calyciflorus were lower in the presence of the cyanobacteria crude extract, more so at 20 degrees than at 25 degrees C. Our results highlight the urgency of regular monitoring based on zooplankton assays for reservoirs in tropical and temperate regions, subject to frequent and dominant cyanobacterial blooms, often as a result of climate change.

Boron in an onshore mud volcanic environment: Case study from the Kerch Peninsula, the Caucasus continental collision zone	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Numerous mud volcanoes (MVs) of the Kerch Peninsula emit water and mud with extreme boron enrichment. Boron content correlates with the burial depth of the source Oligo-Miocene Maykop mudrocks yielding the highest boron contents in illite-dominated mud (up to similar to 900-1500 ppm B) and clay fractions found in the Bulganak MV, which represent the deep endmembers (up to 3.5 km) in the Kerch Peninsula. Smectite-dominated mud and clay fractions from shallow depths (1-1.5 km) at small MVs are poorer in both illite and boron (66- 250 ppm). B-enrichment of the parent shale and diagenetically-driven smectite illitization and dewatering may be main prerequisites for boron enrichment in MVs. The majority of both Cl-HCO3/Na and HCO3-Cl/Na highly evolved saline MV waters sampled in large MVs are enriched in O-18 (delta O-18 = +9.8 to +14.5 parts per thousand VSMOW) and D (delta D = -30 to -4 parts per thousand VSMOW) isotopes being also rich in boron (average 650 ppm). Waters of small MVs with shallow roots are poorer in O-18 (delta O-18 = +3.6 to +6.1 parts per thousand VSMOW) and B (average 130 ppm). MV waters are mainly related to diagenetically altered basinal water diluted by O-18-enriched fresh water released during smectite illitization. The fluid generation temperatures inferred to be T-Mg/Li = 34 to 117 degrees C correspond to source depths of 1.0 to 3.5 km, at 30-35 degrees C/km regional geothermal gradients. In the hot season, MV waters reach a salinity of 40-70 g/L total dissolved solids and precipitate halite, ulexite, borax and tincalconite. At the Bulganak MV field, there is a unique accumulation of MV-related non-marine borates. Such borate deposits can form at the following essential conditions: venting of B-rich MV waters; environment akin to playa lake; long dry and hot seasons; evaporation and ensuing increased boron concentration in shallow close MV pools; pH of MV water between 8.5 and 9.5; low permeability of clayey mud cover.					; Sokol, Ella/A-4058-2014; Киквадзе, Ольга/J-3770-2018; KOZMENKO, OLGA/O-3014-2013; Kokh, Svetlana/A-3817-2014	Belogub, Elena/0000-0001-6623-3630; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				OCT 20	2019	525						58	81		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.07.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.07.018													WOS:000501715700006

Monitoring surface melt using satellite remote sensing can enhance our understanding of ice shelf stability. However, the sensors do not measure the actual physical process of surface melt, but rather observe the presence of liquid water. Moreover, the sensor observations are influenced by the sensor characteristics and surface properties. Therefore, large inconsistencies can exist in the derived melt estimates from different sensors. In this study, we apply state-of-the-art melt detection algorithms to four frequently used remote sensing sensors, i.e., two active microwave sensors, which are Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Sentinel-1, a passive microwave sensor, i.e., Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), and an optical sensor, i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We intercompare the melt detection results over the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet and four selected study regions for the melt seasons 2015-2020. Our results show large spatiotemporal differences in detected melt between the sensors, with particular disagreement in blue ice areas, in aquifer regions, and during wintertime surface melt. We discuss that discrepancies between sensors are mainly due to cloud obstruction and polar darkness, frequency-dependent penetration of satellite signals, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution, as well as the applied melt detection methods. Nevertheless, we argue that different sensors can complement each other, enabling improved detection of surface melt over the Antarctic Ice Sheet.					; Lhermitte, Stef (Stefaan)/A-3385-2013; Wouters, Bert/A-5301-2017; Hu, Zhongyang/AAB-8419-2021; Wouters, Bert/AAA-4254-2019	Lhermitte, Stef/0000-0002-1622-0177; Veldhuijsen, Sanne/0000-0003-3388-6824; de Roda Husman, Sophie/0000-0001-8830-9894; Wouters, Bert/0000-0002-1086-2435; 													1939-1404	2151-1535					2023	16						2462	2480		10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3216953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3216953													WOS:000952892000006

El Nino evolution during the Holocene revealed by a biomarker rain gauge in the Galapagos Islands	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) represents the largest perturbation to the climate system on an inter-annual time scale, but its evolution since the end of the last ice age remains debated due to the lack of unambiguous ENSO records lasting longer than a few centuries. Changes in the concentration and hydrogen isotope ratio of lipids produced by the green alga Botryococcus braunii, which blooms during El Nino rains in the Galapagos Islands, indicate that the early Holocene (9200-5600 yr BP) was characterized by alternating extremes in the intensity and/or frequency of El Nino events that lasted a century or more. Our data from the core of the ENSO region thus calls into question earlier studies that reported a lack of El Nino activity in the early Holocene. In agreement with other proxy evidence from the tropical Pacific, the mid-Holocene (5600-3500 yr BP) was a time of consistently weak El Nino activity, as were the Early Middle Ages (similar to 1000-1500 yr BP). El Nino activity was moderate to high during the remainder of the last 3500 years. Periods of strong or frequent El Nino tended to occur during peaks in solar activity and during extended droughts in the United States Great Plains linked to La Nina. These changing modes of ENSO activity at millennial and multi-centennial timescales may have been caused by variations in the seasonal receipts of solar radiation associated with the precession of the equinoxes and/or changes in solar activity, respectively.

This study proposed a new approach for monitoring and analysis of changes in water level of the Mekong River by using ICESat-2 spaceborne laser altimetry. River water levels were extracted from ICESat-2 inland water level data (ATL13). Then, the remote-sensed water level was quantitatively compared with the in situ water level measured by hydrological stations. Finally, the responses of water level to natural and anthropogenic factors were explored. The results showed that the ATL13 products provided river water level data with a high precision (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.24 m, bias = -0.11 m) and a low measurement uncertainty (median of standard deviations (MSD) = 0.04). The analysis indicated that ATL13 products under different beam intensities and acquisition times can be applied to derive river water level. However, the use of nighttime measurements achieved slightly higher accuracies. The seasonal characteristics of river water level (flooding season from May to October and dry season from November to April of the next year) were because of natural factors, such as upstream flow and rainfall. A comparison of water level changes among different periods showed that hydropower development generally decreased the range of water level in the flooding season and increased water level in the dry season, thereby mitigating the current uneven spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water resources in Mekong basin.

The response of the food web to these drivers of change is not straightforward. To understand the consequences of salinity and eutrophication interactive effects on the food web, we studied the seasonal dynamics of zooplankton and phytoplankton and water quality parameters in 20 lakes of different salinity (from freshwater to hypersaline) and nutrient status (from oligotrophic to eutrophic) located in southern Siberia. We observed a pronounced bottom-up effect of nutrients, which induced an increase in the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton and a decline in water quality. A significant decrease in the species abundance of zooplankton was observed at a threshold salinity of 3 g L-1 and the disappearance of fish at 10 g L-1. The top-down effect induced by salinity manifested itself in an increase in the biomass of zooplankton with the disappearance of fish, and in the change of the size distribution of phytoplankton particles with an increase in the proportion of cladocerans in the zooplankton. Even though we observed that with the salinity increase the food web in saline lakes transformed from three-trophic to two-trophic without fish, we conclude that in the salinity range from 10 to 20-30 g L-1 this transition in most cases will not increase the ability of zooplankton to control phytoplankton. Interactive effects of salinity and eutrophication strongly depend on the size and depth of the lake, as deep stratified lakes tend to have a better water quality with lower biomasses of both phyto- and zooplankton. Thus, the salinity per se is not the driver of the decline in water clarity or the uncontrolled development of phytoplankton. Moreover, for deep lakes, salinity may be a factor affecting the stability of stratification, which mitigates the consequences of eutrophication. Thus, small shallow lakes will be the most vulnerable to the joint effect of salinity increase and eutrophication with the degradation of ecosystem functioning and water quality at moderate salinities of 3-20 g L-1.					; Zadereev, Egor/J-2200-2012; Anishchenko, Olesya/KPB-3909-2024; Drobotov, Anton/I-8428-2018; Kolmakova, Anzhelika/ABL-9266-2022	Anishchenko, Olesya/0000-0002-1976-599X; Drobotov, Anton/0009-0007-1722-4958; Zadereev, Egor/0000-0003-2366-8604														2073-4441				MAY	2022	14	9							1468	10.3390/w14091468	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14091468													WOS:000794446800001

For instance, shallow lakes are important sites of carbon metabolism. Aerobic respiration is one of the important drivers of the carbon metabolism in lakes. In this context, bioturbation impacts of benthic animals (biological reworking of sediment matrix and ventilation of the sediment) on sediment aerobic respiration have previously been underestimated. Biological activity is likely to change over the course of a year due to seasonal changes of water temperatures. This study uses microcosm experiments to investigate how the impact of bioturbation (by Diptera, Chironomidae larvae) on lake sediment respiration changes when temperatures increase. While at 5 degrees C, respiration in sediments with and without chironomids did not differ, at 30 degrees C sediment respiration in microcosms with 2000 chironomids per m(2) was 4.9 times higher than in uninhabited sediments. Our results indicate that lake water temperature increases could significantly enhance lake sediment respiration, which allows us to better understand seasonal changes in lake respiration and carbon metabolism as well as the potential impacts of global warming.

Geomorphological, sedimentological, and bioglyph evidence obtained from field investigations on Badain Jaran Desert lake group, alongside measurements and dating performed on lake relic, prove that these lakes expanded while the climate was relatively wet during early and middle Holocene. The dating results suggest that the pan-lake period of the Badain Jaran Desert began at 10 cal kyr BP, before which the limnic peat period occurred ( 11-10 cal kyr BP). Many lakes reached their maximal water-level during 8.6-6.3 cal kyr BP and retreated or dried up in the late Holocene ( about 3.5-0 cal kyr BP). During that period, the precipitation at Badain Jaran Desert may have reached 200 mm yr(-1) for 7.7-5.3 cal kyr BP, inferred from both the age and precipitation rate of calcareous root tubes. The water balance calculation shows that wetter and warmer climate and the increase of underground water recharge were key factors in maintaining and developing the lake group at both centennial and millennial time scales. Furthermore, lake surface expansion and the increasing fresh water availability set the background for the prosperous prehistoric culture.					jia, peng/JCN-6008-2023; Wang, Yixin/ABF-4336-2021; Li, Zhuolun/AAF-4275-2020; Ma, Lingxiao/KIL-2213-2024	Li, Zhuolun/0000-0003-4164-8551; 													1674-7313	1869-1897				AUG	2016	59	8					1633	1641		10.1007/s11430-016-5307-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-016-5307-7													WOS:000380680400011

Local intensity of artisanal gold mining drives mercury accumulation in neotropical oxbow lake fishes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Driven by surges in global gold prices and additional socio-economic factors, artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Global South is increasing and driving emissions of significant quantities of mercury (Hg) into the air and fresh-water. Hg can be toxic to animal and human populations and exacerbate the degradation of neotropical freshwater eco-systems. We examined drivers of Hg accumulation in fish that inhabit oxbow lakes of Peru's Madre de Dios, a region with high biodiversity value and increasing human populations that depend on ASGM. We hypothesized that fish Hg levels would be driven by local ASGM activities, by environmental Hg exposure, by water quality, and by fish tro-phic level. We sampled fish in 20 oxbow lakes spanning protected areas and areas subject to ASGM during the dry sea-son. Consistent with previous findings, Hg levels were positively associated with ASGM activities, and were higher in larger, carnivorous fish and where water had lower dissolved oxygen levels. In addition, we found a negative relation-ship between fish mercury levels associated with ASGM and the occurrence of the piscivorous giant otter. The link be-tween fine-scale quantification of spatial ASGM activity and Hg accumulation, as indicated by the result that in the lotic environment, localized effects of gold mining activities are stronger drivers (77 % model support) of Hg accumu-lation than environmental exposure (23 %) constitutes a novel contribution to a growing body of literature on Hg con-tamination. Our findings provide additional evidence of high Hg exposure risks to neotropical human and top carnivore populations subject to the impacts of ASGM, which depend on freshwater ecosystems undergoing gradual degradation. The documented spatial variation in Hg accumulation and increased Hg levels in carnivorous fish should serve as a warning to human communities in Madre de Dios to avoid the proximity of high-intensity gold mining areas and minimize local carnivorous fish consumption.					; Fernandez, Luis/E-1162-2011; Flores, Julio/GQP-2325-2022; Swaisgood, Ronald/AAL-3198-2020	Fernandez, Luis/0000-0003-3879-1445; Swaisgood, Ronald/0000-0001-5353-2148; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 15	2023	886								164024	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164024		MAY 2023						37172853					WOS:001000629700001

Hydraulic transmissivity inferred from ice-sheet relaxation following Greenland supraglacial lake drainages	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Surface meltwater reaching the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet transits through drainage networks, modulating the flow of the ice sheet. Dye and gas-tracing studies conducted in the western margin sector of the ice sheet have directly observed drainage efficiency to evolve seasonally along the drainage pathway. However, the local evolution of drainage systems further inland, where ice thicknesses exceed 1000 m, remains largely unknown. Here, we infer drainage system transmissivity based on surface uplift relaxation following rapid lake drainage events. Combining field observations of five lake drainage events with a mathematical model and laboratory experiments, we show that the surface uplift decreases exponentially with time, as the water in the blister formed beneath the drained lake permeates through the subglacial drainage system. This deflation obeys a universal relaxation law with a timescale that reveals hydraulic transmissivity and indicates a two-order-of-magnitude increase in subglacial transmissivity (from 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm(3) to 215 +/- 90.2 mm(3)) as the melt season progresses, suggesting significant changes in basal hydrology beneath the lakes driven by seasonal meltwater input.

Characterizing dissolved organic matter in Taihu Lake with PARAFAC and SOM method	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum has a significant amount of information than the single-stage scanning fluorescence spectrum. At the same time, the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis and neural network method can help explore the fluorescence characteristics further, thus could be used to analyse multiple sets of three-dimensional matrix data. In this study, the PARAFAC analysis and the self-organizing mapping (SOM) neural network method are firstly introduced comprehensively. They are then adopted to extract information of the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum data set for fluorescence characteristics analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Taihu Lake water. Forty water samples with DOM species were taken from different seasons with the fluorescence information obtained through the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum analysis, PARAFAC analysis and SOM analysis. The PARAFAC analysis results indicated that the main fluorescence components of dissolved organic matter in Taihu Lake water were aromatic proteins, fulvic acids, and dissolved microorganisms. While the SOM analysis results exhibited that the fluorescence characteristics of the dissolved organics in Taihu Lake varied seasonally. Therefore, the combined method of the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum analysis, PARAFAC and SOM analysis can provide important information for the characterization of the fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter in surface water bodies.					; DONG, Bin/LFU-9400-2024	Li, Tian/0000-0001-5117-7883; 													0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN 15	2022	85	2					706	718	1	10.2166/wst.2022.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2022.010		JAN 2022						35100148					WOS:000740983800001

Other studies have found no long-term trends in water body extents, but large intra- and inter-annual changes driven by precipitation. These differences could be due to geographic variability in physical conditions (geology, climate, permafrost and hydrology) or in the data and methods used to extract water bodies. This study tested water extraction methods over the Tuktoyaktuk Coastal Plain, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, based on the Landsat 5 shortwave infrared (SWIR) channel and validated them using water extents obtained from 05 m resolution orthophoto imagery. Methods included applying thresholds to generate binary land/water classifications, as well as deriving 30 m water fractions from both linear unmixing and a new histogram breakpoint method. Results indicated that the histogram breakpoint method outperformed other methods, underestimating overall water fraction by 0.26% and overestimating the number of pure 30 m water pixels by 0.66% compared to water fractions calculated from orthophotos. The breakpoint method was then applied to a stack of 17 near peak-of-season Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 images acquired between July 4 and August 18 from 1985 to 2011 to create a water fraction time-series for examining both trends and inter-annual variation in water extent. Results showed an overall expansion of lake area along margins by 55 km(2) with isolated lakes experiencing rapid drainage totalling 15 km(2), leading to a net water area increase of 40 km(2) over the 26-year period.

Upstream and downstream responses of fish assemblages to an eastern Amazonian hydroelectric dam	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1.Major hydroelectric dams are proliferating in tropical regions such as Amazonia, where extensive new hydropower developments are planned despite potentially severe ecological and social impacts. The status of freshwater biota in the vicinity of existing dams could be valuable to predict the effects of such developments, but detailed ecological monitoring before and after dam construction is frequently lacking. 2.In the absence of these data, we used a space-for-time replacement to compare a key component of the aquatic biota at upstream and downstream sites, with the latter more closely resembling river channel conditions prior to the dam. We assessed the fish assemblages upstream and downstream of the Coaracy Nunes Dam in Amapa, Brazil, the first ecological study at this site since this dam was constructed 42years earlier. We used gillnets during eight bimonthly field campaigns, covering both wet and dry seasons, and sampled the ichthyofauna (1819 individuals, 81 species) at four sites: Downstream Channel, Reservoir, Upstream Lake and Upstream Channel. 3.We found clear negative impacts on the abundance, biomass, species richness, alpha diversity and species dominance upstream of the dam. The physical subdivision of the river channel and the upstream channel conversion from lentic to lotic habitats were strongly associated with differences in the composition and structure of fish communities. Notable changes include an increased contribution of small-bodied fish in the reservoir and an absence of long-distance migrants upstream of the dam. 4.Downstream channel habitats, in particular, retained their fish diversity with high conservation value typical of eastern Amazonia, yet these areas now face the threat of new hydropower development farther downstream. The long-term impacts on aquatic biodiversity highlighted in this study are especially relevant in the face of burgeoning new hydroelectricity development plans for rivers across lowland Amazonia.

Lake Erie tributary nutrient trend evaluation: Normalizing concentrations and loads to reduce flow variability	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Establishing tributary load (i.e., the mass exported over a period of time) targets to reduce anthropogenic nutrient inputs to receiving waters - and thus eutrophication - is a common mitigation strategy in freshwater and coastal ecosystems. However, detecting and quantifying trends can be difficult because annual precipitation strongly influences tributary flow (e.g., average daily stream discharge). This may obscure trends as wet years tend to produce high tributary loads despite management activities to reduce nutrient export, and dry years typically generate low loads, even without management of nutrients. Furthermore, flow and nutrient concentrations are often correlated. Earlier efforts to reduce the effect of flow variability on tributary nutrient assessment were limited by computational and methodological constraints, until the weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season (WRTDS) method was introduced in 2010. Here we use WRTDS to assess nutrient concentration and load changes from 1982 to 2018 in three tributaries to the western basin of Lake Erie, of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Generally, trends revealed by flow-normalization do not contradict those of non-normalized metrics; however flow-normalization made the patterns more perceptible than in non-normalized metrics and reduced the influence of a particularly wet or dry period at the end of records on long-term trend analysis. We demonstrate that using WRTDS for flow-normalization removed the noise arising from annual precipitation variability and makes tributary nutrient trend evaluation more straightforward.

However, fish in natural environments are continuously exposed to MC-LR throughout their entire life cycle as opposed to short-term exposure. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mechanism by which MC-LR harms female fish reproduction and development within natural water bodies is through interference of the reproductive endocrine system. In the present study, zebrafish hatchlings (5 d post-fertilization) were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3 and 30)mu g/L MC-LR for 90 d until reaching sexual maturity. Female zebrafish were selected, and the changes in growth and developmental indicators, ovarian ultrastructure as well as the levels of gonadal steroid hormones and vitellogenin (VTG) were examined along with the transcription of related genes in the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal liver axis (HPGL-axis). The results showed for the first time, a life cycle exposure to MC-LR caused growth inhibition, decreased ovary weight and ovarian ultra-pathological lesions. Decreased ovarian testosterone levels indicated that MC-LR disrupted sex steroid hormone balance. Significantly up-regulated transcription of brain FSH beta and LH beta along with ovarian ER alpha, FSHR and LHR suggested positive feedback regulation in the HPGL-axis was induced as a compensatory mechanism for MC-LR damage. It was also noted that ovarian VTG content and hepatic ERa and VTG1 expression were all down-regulated, which might be responsible for reduced vitellus storage noted in our histological observations. Our findings indicate that a life cycle exposure to MC-LR impairs the development and reproduction of female zebrafish by disrupting the transcription of related HPGL-axis genes, suggesting that MC-LR has potential adverse effects on fish reproduction and thus population dynamics in MCs-contaminated aquatic environment.

In the Awash River basin, Ethiopia, these drivers are impacting on water quality with further impacts created due to changes in water management releasing geogenic contaminants. The resulting water quality has potential to cause significant ecological and human health impacts. The physicochemical and heavy metals saptio-temporal variability and their associated risks to human health and ecology were assessed across twenty sampling stations in the Awash River basin. Over twenty-two physicochemical and ten heavy metals parameters were analyzed using different instruments including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Elevated levels of heavy metals (As, V, Mo, Mn, and Fe) were detected in the surface water, surpassing the drinking water quality standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Seasonal variation was evident with peak concentration of As, Ni, Hg, and Cr were recorded in the dry season. A water quality index, hazard quotient, hazard index, heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index were formulated to assess the potential risks to both human health and the environment. The highest values of heavy metal pollution index (HPI) above the threshold (>100) were observed in stations at Lake Beseka with HPI values ranged from 105 to 177. Similarly, the highest values of the heavy metals evaluation index (HEI) were observed in stations situated at cluster 3. The evaluation of health risk that is not related to cancer through hazard quotient demonstrated that in the case of both dermal and ingestion contact, cluster C3 > C1 > C4 > C2 and C3 > C4 > C2 > C1 were observed in children and adults, respectively. Overall, measures to reduce potential pollution risks must be taken in accordance with the standards in the river basin. Nevertheless, further research on the toxicity of heavy metals that pose risks to human health is also necessary.

Accele-rator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating methods were applied to bulk organic matter of the samples. Artemisia spp./Chenopodiaceae ratios and results from principal component analysis were used to infer that the lake basin was dominated by desert vegetation before ca. 9.6 cal. ka BP, which suggests a warm and dry climate in the early Holocene. Desert steppe/steppe expanded during 9.6-5.5 cal. ka BP, indicating a remarkable increase both in the precipitation and temperature during the mid-Holocene. Desert vegetation dominated between 6.5 and 5.5 cal. ka BP, marking an extreme warmer and drier interval. The steppe/meadow steppe recovered, and temperatures decreased from 5.5 cal. ka BP in the late Holocene, as indicated by the increased abundance of Artemisia and the development of meadows. Holocene temperatures and moisture variations in the Sayram Lake areas were similar to those of adjacent areas. This consistency implies that solar radiation was the main driving factor for regional temperature changes, and that the effect of temperature variations was significant on regional changes in humidity. The evolution of climate and environment in the Sayram Lake areas, which were characterized as dry in the early Holocene and relatively humid in the middle-late Holocene, are clearly different from those in monsoonal areas. Dry conditions in the early Holocene in the Sayram Lake areas were closely related to decreased water vapor advection. These conditions were a result of reduced westerly wind speeds and less evaporation upstream, which in turn were caused by seasonal changes in solar radiation superimposed by strong evaporation following warming and drying local climate.

Climate change affects aquatic ecosystems differently depending on local conditions. In the Mediterranean region, predicted drier seasons could especially affect lake water residence time and in consequence cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin dynamics. 2. We carried out a 3-year study of a shallow, Mediterranean lake (Lake Albufera, Spain), to study the effects of water residence time and other drivers on the dynamics of harmful cyanobacteria and microcystin concentrations (MCYST). 3. Longer water residence time in dry years and dry seasons increased total cyanobacteria biomass, Microcystis aeruginosa populations and MCYST concentrations in the lake water and seston. Droughts increased water retention time by about 45%, and M.aeruginosa populations and MCYST were 12 orders of magnitude higher. 4. All samples analysed contained MCYST, and among them 70% had values above the recommended guidelines. Flows lower than 10m3s1 raised toxicological risk from low to moderate-high according to international standards. Mean MCYST concentrations bound in the cells were one order of magnitude higher than in the water (11 +/- 2.9 and 1.2 +/- 0.3gL1, respectively). 5. The microcystin content per unit biovolume of M.aeruginosa was generally higher at the start of population growth (AprilMay) than at the population maximum (JulyOctober). This was related to increase in water residence time, total phosphorus concentration and mean colony size within the edible range (<50m). The maximum MCYST content corresponded with average populations of 103coloniesL1 and 2mm3L1, which could additionally be used to evaluate toxicological risks in the lake. 6. Microcystis aeruginosa colonies were larger with increasing water residence time and more closely related to the lake hydrology and water column stagnation than to MCYST colony content. 7. Feasible measures for restoration and conservation of shallow Mediterranean lakes in a future climate scenario are discussed.

Space use and habitat selection of an invasive mesopredator and sympatric, native apex predator	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background Where mesopredators co-exist with dominant apex predators, an understanding of the factors that influence their habitat and space use can provide insights that help guide wildlife conservation and pest management actions. A predator's habitat use is defined by its home range, which is influenced by its selection or avoidance of habitat features and intra- and inter-specific interactions within the landscape. These are driven by both innate and learned behaviour, operating at different spatial scales. We examined the seasonal home ranges and habitat selection of actively-managed populations of a native apex predator (dingo Canis dingo) and invasive mesopredator (feral cat Felis catus) in semi-arid Western Australia to better understanding their sympatric landscape use, potential interactions, and to help guide their management. Methods We used kernel density estimates to characterise the seasonal space use of dingoes and feral cats, investigate inter- and intra-species variation in their home range extent and composition, and examine second-order habitat selection for each predator. Further, we used discrete choice modelling and step selection functions to examine the difference in third-order habitat selection across several habitat features. Results The seasonal home ranges of dingoes were on average 19.5 times larger than feral cats. Feral cat seasonal home ranges typically included a larger proportion of grasslands than expected relative to availability in the study site, indicating second-order habitat selection for grasslands. In their fine-scale movements (third-order habitat selection), both predators selected for roads, hydrological features (seasonal intermittent streams, seasonal lakes and wetlands), and high vegetation cover. Dingoes also selected strongly for open woodlands, whereas feral cats used open woodlands and grasslands in proportion to availability. Management recommendations Based on these results, and in order to avoid unintended negative ecological consequences (e.g. mesopredator release) that may stem from non-selective predator management, we recommend that feral cat control focuses on techniques such as trapping and shooting that are specific to feral cats in areas where they overlap with apex predators (dingoes), and more general techniques such as poison baiting where they are segregated.

J	Head, JW; Marchant, DR				Head, James W.; Marchant, David R.			The climate history of early Mars: insights from the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys hydrologic system	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The early climate of Mars (Noachian Period, the first similar to 20% of its history) is thought to differ significantly from that of its more recent history (Amazonian Period, the last similar to 66%) which is characterized by hyperarid, hypothermal conditions that result in mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) well below 0 degrees C, a global cryosphere, minimal melting on the ground surface, and a horizontally stratified hydrologic system. We explore the nature of the fluvial and lacustrine environments in the Mars-like hyperarid, hypothermal McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), where the MAAT is well below 0 degrees C (similar to-14 to -30 degrees C) in order to assess whether the Late Noachian geologic record can be explained by a climate characterized by "cold and icy" conditions. We find that the MDV hydrological system and cycle provide important insights into the potential configuration of a "cold and icy" early Mars climate in which MDV-like ephemeral streams and rivers, and both closed-basin and open-basin lakes could form. We review a series of MDV fluvial and lacustrine features to guide investigators in the analysis of the geomorphology of early Mars and we outline a new model for the nature and evolution of a "cold and icy" Late Noachian climate based on these observations. We conclude that a cold and icy Late Noachian Mars with MAAT below freezing, but peak seasonal and peak daily temperatures above 0 degrees C, could plausibly account for the array of Noachian-aged fluvial and lacustrine features observed on Mars. Our assessment also provides insight into the potential effects of punctuated warming on a cold and icy early Mars, in which impact crater formation or massive volcanic eruptions cause temperatures in the melting range for decadal to centennial timescales. We outline a set of outstanding questions and tests concerning the nature and evolution of these features on Mars.																			0954-1020	1365-2079				DEC	2014	26	6			SI		774	800		10.1017/S0954102014000686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102014000686													WOS:000344736100016

How variability in the relative strength and trajectory of these climatic systems has affected local to regional palaeoclimatic conditions remains little known. Here, we employ multi-proxy peat core analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15 in Sphagnum, plant macrofossil, pollen, charcoal) from Plotnikovo Mire, part of the Great Vasyugan Mire in western Siberia (Tomsk province, Russia). We provide a high-resolution record of variations in climatic conditions and the biogeochemical fluxes of carbon and nitrogen over the past 2000 years and then discus the link between local climatic conditions and larger scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Our record shows that generally warm and dry conditions prevailed from BC 500 to 500 CE. Warm and wet episodes occurred during the early (800-950 CE) and later (1150-1300 CE) part of the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly (MCA), and were interrupted by a warm and dry mid-MCA phase (1000-1200 CE). Progressively cooler and wetter conditions established from 1400 CE, which became most marked between 1600 and 1850 CE, coincident with the Little Ice Age (LIA). Finally, drying of the mire surface reflects the warming trend of recent decades. We found that C accumulation was greater (90 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) at times of wetter conditions and when Sphagnum was dominant, and lowest (35 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) during periods of mixed vascular plant growth and Sphagnum under drier/unstable hydrological conditions. This peatland has been an active C sink over the past 1500 years, however, its ability to sequester carbon has decreased with recent warming and may continue to decrease with ongoing climatic warming and drying. We hypothesise that generally warm and moist conditions at the study site and over wider Siberia during the MCA could have been linked to a weakening of the Siberian High, which in turn enhanced the ingress of Atlantic moisture-carrying air masses across Siberia. Conversely, a strengthened SH overlapping negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) modes during the LIA, resulted in a longer cold season with a delayed snowmelt and diminished evapotranspiration. This study shows that the interplay of moisture bearing air masses from different origins led to complex local hydroclimate and biogeochemical patterns. However, to resolve the spatio-temporal coherency of such climate variability due to the interaction of different air masses, and therefore better predict future climate changes, a denser network of palaeo-records is needed.

J	Carleton, KL; Yourick, MR				Carleton, Karen L.; Yourick, Miranda R.			Axes of visual adaptation in the ecologically diverse family Cichlidae	SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												The family Cichlidae contains approximately 2000 species that live in diverse freshwater habitats including murky lakes, turbid rivers, and clear lakes from both the Old and New Worlds. Their visual systems are similarly diverse and have evolved specific sensitivities that differ along several axes of variation. Variation in cornea and lens transmission affect which wavelengths reach the retina. Variation in photoreceptor number and distribution affect brightness sensitivity, spectral sensitivity and resolution. Probably their most dynamic characteristic is the variation in visual pigment peak sensitivities. Visual pigments can be altered through changes in chromophore, opsin sequence and opsin expression. Opsin expression varies by altering which of the seven available cone opsins in their genomes are turned on. These opsins can even be coexpressed to produce seemingly infinitely tunable cone sensitivities. Both chromophore and opsin expression can vary on either rapid (hours or days), slower (seasonal or ontogenetic) or evolutionary timescales. Such visual system shifts have enabled cichlids to adapt to different habitats and foraging styles. Through both short term plasticity and longer evolutionary adaptations, cichlids have proven to be ecologically successful and an excellent model for studying organismal adaptation.

J	Hengstmann, E; Fischer, EK				Hengstmann, Elena; Fischer, Elke Kerstin			Anthropogenic litter in freshwater environments - Study on lake beaches evaluating marine guidelines and aerial imaging	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Studies on macroplastic pollution in freshwater systems are rare compared to the marine environment. Nevertheless, freshwater systems are worthy to be equally investigated as they are pathways of plastic to the ocean and lakes may act as (temporary) sinks. The aim of this study was to identify sources for plastics and influences on its distribution in a limnic environment. Anthropogenic litter (>5 mm) was monitored semi-annually over a three-year period at four sandy bank border segments of Lake Tollense in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The selected beaches represent different expositions and vary in their level of anthropogenic activity. Considering all six samplings, mean abundance of anthropogenic litter is 0.2 +/- 0.1 items/m(2) or 130.9 +/- 91.0 items/100 m beach length. The averaged mass of anthropogenic litter is 0.5 +/- 1.0 g/m(2) or rather 218.7 +/- 284.6 g/100 m. Plastic consistently is the predominate material (72%) and cigarette butts are the most found items. A higher pollution by anthropogenic litter is found at the end of tourist season unveiling the impact of anthropogenic activity on litter abundance. Additionally, litter transport via tributaries into the lake plays a role. Testing the detection of anthropogenic litter via aerial images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles resulted in good recovery rates when minimizing the flight height. Furthermore, the analysis of anthropogenic litter distribution displayed on the images showed litter accumulation areas at the border of sandy beach areas. The deployment of marine guidelines in a freshwater environment did work well, however, small changes in the protocol are suggested for future lake beach studies dealing with anthropogenic litter pollution.					; Fischer, Elke/AAP-2266-2021	Fischer, Elke Kerstin/0000-0002-2892-8658; Hengstmann, Elena/0000-0002-2505-8992													0013-9351	1096-0953				OCT	2020	189								109945	10.1016/j.envres.2020.109945	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109945								32980020					WOS:000576646100006
J	Hu, X; Bürgmann, R				Hu, Xie; Burgmann, Roland			Aquifer deformation and active faulting in Salt Lake Valley, Utah, USA	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Aquifers and fault zones may interact through groundwater flow and stress redistribution, yet their spatiotemporal relationship remains enigmatic. Here we quantify changes in water storage and associated stress along the Wasatch Fault Zone in Salt Lake Valley, recently shaken by a M5.7 earthquake on March 18th, 2020. Ground deformation mapped by Sentinel-1 SAR imagery (2014-2019) reveals an elongated area with similar to 50-mm seasonal uplift corresponding to 0.03-0.06-km(3) water storage cycles. Phase shifts across active faults in both water level and deformation suggest control by the low-permeability structures. The seasonal stress changes on the adjoining faults from poroelastic volume strain are two orders of magnitude larger than those from hydrological surface loading, but both are small compared to the annual increase of tectonic loading at seismogenic depths. Historic seismic events, limited in number, do not exhibit statistically significant annual periodicity and hydrological modulation of microseismicity or triggering of the recent M5.7 event is not evident.

Consequently, the Saline-Sodic soils formed around the saline lakes, previously submitted to salinization and solonization, have been converted into Sodic, Solodized-Solonetz and Solod soils around the brackish lakes, under the action of solonization and/or solodization. In this research, fine clay fractions ( < 0.2 mu m size) of B natric horizons of Saline-Sodic soils surrounding a saline lake and Sodic and Solod soils surrounding brackish lakes were studied in order to understand the genesis of clay minerals with the gradual transformation of these salt-affected soils. Fine clay mineralogy was studied by experimental XRD, full XRD profile modelling using NEWMOD 3.2.1, STEM/HAADF and ICP-OES. In the Saline-Sodic soils, illitic mixed-layered RO kaolinite-illite (K-I) and RO illite-smectite (I-S) comprise most of the samples, the percentage of illite (in K-I and I-S), kaolinite in RO kaolinite smectite (K-S and K-I), and smectite (in K-S and I-S) layers was 73-76%, 14-16% and 10-11%, respectively. In the Sodic soils, illitic K-I and/or I-S still dominate the samples, but the percentage of illite layers (in K-I, I-S and/or illite-vermiculite) is smaller (52-68%), with an increase of kaolinite (19-35% in end member kaolinite, K-S and K-I) and smectite (7-21% in K-S and I-S) layers. Finally, the Solod soil shows dominance of smectitic I-S and illitic I-S, with a significant decrease in illite layers (36-41% in K-I and I-S), the maintenance of kaolinite layers (21-31% in pure kaolinite, K-S and K-I) and significant increase in smectite layers (31-37% in K-S and I-S). These progressive changes in mineral assemblages from the most alkaline (Saline-Sodic) to the most acidic soil (Solod) is probably due to gradual transformations, especially from the illitic phases, neoformed around the saline lake, to other 2:1 (mixed-layered smectite) and 1:1 (mixed-layered kaolinite) clay minerals under the new geochemical conditions of the brackish lakes. The mineral range observed in the samples suggest that the transformation from one clay mineral into another takes place without the complete dissolution and consequent precipitation, but as progressive mixed-layering reactions. This model explains the existence of several mixed-layered minerals, which is in agreement with the geochemical evolution of soils under progressive solonization and solodization.

J	Debroas, D; Hugoni, M; Domaizon, I				Debroas, Didier; Hugoni, Mylene; Domaizon, Isabelle			Evidence for an active rare biosphere within freshwater protists community	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Studies on the active rare biosphere at the RNA level are mainly focused on Bacteria and Archaea and fail to include the protists, which are involved in the main biogeochemical cycles of the earth. In this study, the richness, composition and activity of the rare protistan biosphere were determined from a temporal survey of two lakes by pyrosequencing. In these ecosystems, the always rare OTUs represented 77.2% of the total OTUs and 76.6% of the phylogenetic diversity. From the various phylogenetic indices computed, the phylogenetic units (PUs) constituted exclusively by always rare OTUs were discriminated from the other PUs. Therefore, the rare biosphere included mainly taxa that are distant from the reference databases compared to the dominant ones. In addition, the rarest OTUs represented 59.8% of the active biosphere depicted by rRNA and the activity (rRNA:rDNA ratio) increased with the rarity. The high rRNA:rDNA ratio determined in the rare fraction highlights that some protists were active at low abundances and contribute to ecosystem functioning. Interestingly, the always rare and active OTUs were characterized by seasonal changes in relation with the main environmental parameters measured. In conclusion, the rare eukaryotes represent an active, dynamic and overlooked fraction in the lacustrine ecosystems.

It is critical for water quality management to understand the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus stratification and its driving forces. In this study, high-frequency total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) from January 2017 to October 2019 were estimated using the datasets of high-frequency buoy parameters, including water temperature, pH, chlorophyll-a, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter. The results revealed that both nitrogen and phosphorus in water column were periodically stratified. Specifically, the stratification of nitrogen and phosphorus occurred from April to December or January of the following year. Moreover, indices of TN stratification (IC-TN) and TP stratification (IC-TP) were - 0.29 similar to 0.05 and - 0.78 similar to 0.28, respectively. Significant (P < 0.01) positive correlations were observed between RWCS (an index of thermal stability) and IC-TN (or IC-TP), indicating thermal stratification may be the main driving force of nutrient stratification at inter-month scales. Further analysis indicated that the thermal stratification may affect nitrogen and phosphorus stratification though (1) influencing algal growth and (2) affecting the release of internal sources and the material exchange between water columns. Furthermore, precipitation is also suggested as an important factor affecting the stability of nitrogen and phosphorus vertical profile in the flood season. These findings may provide important information for optimizing water quality management efforts in Qiandaohu and other subtropical deep reservoirs. In addition, the knowledge of the effect of temperature and precipitation on nutrient stratification are essential to understand future ecosystem dynamics of deep reservoirs.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Zhang, Ping/Q-8752-2017; Shi, Pengcheng/LGZ-1138-2024; Wang, Yucheng/MIU-5352-2025	Guangwei, Zhu/0000-0002-6718-8576; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2022	29	19					27738	27748		10.1007/s11356-021-17877-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17877-6		JAN 2022						34981372					WOS:000737756400015
J	Murray, J; Nordstrom, DK; Dold, B; Kirschbaum, A				Murray, Jesica; Kirk Nordstrom, D.; Dold, Bernhard; Kirschbaum, Alicia			Seasonal fluctuations and geochemical modeling of acid mine drainage in the semi-arid Puna region: The Pan de Azucar Pb-Ag-Zn mine, Argentina	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Pan de Azucar is an inactive Pb-Ag-Zn mine in the semi-arid Puna region of NW Argentina at 3600 m above sealevel. The mine is situated in Los Pozuelos basin, which is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Substantial pyrite and few carbonate minerals are present in the tailings. The generated acid mine drainage (AMD) has low pH (1.92-4.06) and is mainly Fe-Zn-SO4 type water with high concentrations of metals that in order of relative abundance vary as: Al >> Cd > As(T) > Ni > V > Cu > Co > Sb > Cr > Pb > Sn > Ag. The strong annual cycle of dry and wet seasons in the Puna generates a significant influence on AMD geochemistry. In the dry season, there is no runoff and AMD drains mainly in the form of seepages with low pH (1.92-2.21), high concentrations of metals, and the formation of metal-rich soluble efflorescent salts is favored by strong evaporation. At the beginning of the wet season, the efflorescent salts rapidly dissolve and metals concentrations in AMD increase significantly, creating the most hazardous period for the surrounding fluvial environment. At the end of the wet season the pH increases (3.44-4.06) and the concentration of metals decreases, especially arsenic associated with ferric iron precipitates. As a consequence of the DC3 dam restoration, a large volume of AMD is retained forming an acid pond, in which processes of AMD mixing, secondary minerals precipitation, and sulfide oxidation were quantified by inverse modeling with mixing. Jarosite and schwertmannite precipitates in the surface of the pond and favors the attenuation of As and Pb. However, subaqueous oxidation of sulfide minerals, hydrolysis of silicates, and mixing with upstream AMD seepage increases the concentrations of SO42-, Fe(II), and the other metals in the seepage of the pond that migrates downstream. The results of this study indicate the necessity to improve the remediation methods of Pan de Azucar mine. It is expected that other sulfide mines in the Puna region will have a similar variability of the AMD geochemistry, which should be considered for mine closure, remediation, and monitoring of water quality in mining.

Fatty Acid Composition and Contents of Fish of Genus Salvelinus from Natural Ecosystems and Aquaculture	BIOMOLECULES												Fatty acids (FA) of muscle tissue of Salvelinus species and its forms, S. alpinus, S. boganidae, S. drjagini, and S. fontinalis, from six Russian lakes and two aquacultures, were analyzed. Considerable variations in FA compositions and contents were found, including contents of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA), which are important indicators of fish nutritive value for humans. As found, contents of EPA+DHA (mg center dot g(-1) wet weight) in muscle tissue of Salvelinus species and forms varied more than tenfold. These differences were supposed to be primarily determined by phylogenetic factors, rather than ecological factors, including food. Two species, S. boganidae and S. drjagini, had the highest EPA+DHA contents in their biomass and thereby could be recommended as promising species for aquaculture to obtain production with especially high nutritive value.

However, the hydrodynamic simulation under climate change conditions suffers from the uncertainty of the downstream water level boundary. In this study, an effective approach was developed by integrating an advanced machine learning algorithm and a process-based watershed hydrological model to predict the lake level under climate change. The developed approach was validated in a vital conservation wetland in the Ramsar Convention, the Poyang Lake floodplain wetland in China and utilized to simulate the hydrological regime in climate change. We found that the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) performed relatively well in the simulation of water level, with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.94 and 0.83 in the training and testing periods, respectively. The mean cumulative flooding time in the future period was slightly less than that in the baseline period, with a decreased range of 1.01 -12.05 days/year. The highest and mean water levels rose significantly in the wet season, with a risen range of 1.01 -3.3 and 1.56 -2.44 m, respectively, and the appearance of extreme flood events became more frequent. The maximum, minimum, and mean inflows for Poyang Lake in the dry season exhibited a remarkable reduction trend, especially for the minimum inflow, with a reduced range of 59.37%-79.22%, indicating that more serious extreme drought events would appear in Poyang Lake. The developed approach has good performance for water level simulation and extreme runoff prediction, thus providing a viable way for future water resources management in floodplain wetlands.					zhang, jianyun/X-7292-2018														0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		A						130193	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130193		SEP 2023											WOS:001090898100001

We hypothesized that the introduction of maize into a permanent paddy-rice cropping system boosts drainage and leaching losses of nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the initial years of maize establishment, due to the disturbance of the equilibrated soil conditions established under continuous paddy cropping. We tested this hypothesis in a 3.5-year field experiment using monolith lysimeters cropped with either (i) single paddy rice in the wet season and maize in the dry season (maize-paddy rice, M-MIX), or (H) double paddy rice (R-WET) as control. Expandable and compressible pads minimized the formation of a gap at the interface between soil monolith and lysimeter casing during shrinking and swelling of the clay soil. In the first year of introducing maize, drainage (6061 l m(-2) yr(-1)) and leaching of total nitrogen (TN, 6.8 g N N m(-2) yr(-1)) and DOC (2.7 g(-2) yr(-1)) were significantly larger in M-MIX than in R-WET (water: 1491 m(-2) yr(-1), TN: 0.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), DOC: 0.7 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, the additional losses of water, nitrogen, and DOC caused by the introduction of maize disappeared in the following years. In the last two dry seasons of our study, drainage and leaching losses of TN, and DOC were even significantly smaller in M-MIX than in R-WET. In the dry seasons of the 2nd to 4th year after introducing maize (2013-2015), M-MIX saved on average 388 l m(-2) of percolation water losses compared to R-WET and leaching losses of TN and DOC under maize were reduced on average by 0.6 g m(-2) and 1.6 g m(-2), respectively. We conclude that leaching losses of water and nutrients are only transiently boosted during the first year after introducing maize in perennial rice cropping systems, so that maize cropping in the dry season could save water and reduce nutrient leaching in comparison to continuous paddy-rice cropping in the long run. Long-term field trials are necessary to validate the lysimeter results.

Estimates of lake volume, however, are limited by the availability of in situ measurements of water depth, which in turn also limits the assessment of remotely sensed lake depths. Given the logistical difficulty of collecting physical bathymetric measurements, methods relying upon in situ data are generally restricted to small areas and thus their application to largescale studies is difficult to validate. Here, we produce and validate spaceborne estimates of supraglacial lake volumes across a relatively large area (1250 km(2)) of west Greenland's ablation region using data acquired by the WorldView-2 (WV-2) sensor, making use of both its stereo-imaging capability and its meter-scale resolution. We employ spectrally-derived depth retrieval models, which are either based on absolute reflectance (single channel model) or a ratio of spectral reflectances in two bands (dual-channel model). These models are calibrated by using WV-2 multispectral imagery acquired early in the melt season and depth measurements from a high resolution WV-2 DEM over the same lake basins when devoid of water. The calibrated models are then validated with different lakes in the area, for which we determined depths. Lake depth estimates based on measurements recorded in WV-2's blue (450-510 nm), green (510-580 nm), and red (630-690 nm) bands and dual-channel modes (blue/green, blue/red, and green/red band combinations) had near-zero bias, an average root-mean squared deviation of 0.4 m (relative to post-drainage DEM5), and an average volumetric error of <1%.

We use radiocarbon-dated terrestrial plant macrofossils to establish a sound chronology and palynological analyses to reconstruct the vegetation and fire history of the Lago Rogaguado area. The sedimentary pollen and spore record suggests that wetland and wooded savannah (Cerrado) environments occurred around the lake between 8100 and 5800 cal BR Fire activity was high during this period and was probably connected to the dry Cerrado environments. The pollen evidence suggests early plant cultivation (Zea mays, Annonaceae and Cucurbitaceae) from 6500 cal BP onwards, which is significantly earlier than hitherto assumed for Amazonia. Gallery forests expanded after 5800 cal BP, when fire activity strongly declined. Forest expansion intensified around 2800 cal BP and continued until 2000 cal BP, when forest cover reached its maximum and fire activity its minimum. The late-Holocene forest expansion to the south and the decrease of fire activity may have resulted from a climatic shift to moister conditions (possibly a shorter dry season). New crops (e.g. Avenatype) or adventive plants (e.g. Rumex acetosella-type) document the impact of European economies after ca. 500 cal BP. Land use intensity remained rather stable over the most recent centuries, arguing against a collapse of settlements in response to the arrival of Europeans, as reconstructed from other Amazonian pollen records.

In this study, we analyzed the seasonal variation and ecological risk of MPs concentrations in economic fish species from Lake Chaohu in China between wet and dry seasons. Within both seasons, MPs in fish were systematically analyzed using methods of KOH digestion, NaCl density floatation and raman spectroscopy. MPs abundance in economic fishes were significantly higher in dry season than that in wet season, which can be ascribed to the MPs' amplification effects in lacustrine ecosystems during dry season. Whereas, our results recorded similar and homogenized characteristic composition of MPs in economic fishes between wet and dry seasons. In both seasons, fiber was the main morphological type, black and blue were the most common MPs color, and MPs ranging from <0.5 mm accounting for the most abundant size. In addition, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) accounted for the most abundant polymer type detected by economic fishes in both seasons. In terms of feeding groups and habitat preferences, planktivorous and pelagic fish species exhibited sensitive variations of MPs concentrations between wet and dry seasons, thus being highlighted as good bioindicators of MPs contaminants in freshwater ecosystems. Our results revealed higher ecological risks of MPs in wet season than that in dry season when indicating from polymer risk index (H). By providing detailed and direct toxicity information, our study highlights the usage of polymer risk index for ecological risk assessment in aquatic organisms.					; xie, chang/GYJ-2493-2022; Wu, Jiajun/AAM-6936-2021	Jiang, Zhongguan/0000-0002-5949-6106; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 10	2022	833								155181	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155181		APR 2022						35421469					WOS:000793815900007

A potential expression of density-size distributions are Normalized Biomass Size Spectra (NBSS), which plot the logarithm of biomass independent of taxonomy within bins of logarithmic organismal size, divided by the bin width. Theoretically, the NBSS slope of multi-trophic communities is exactly - 1.0 if the trophic transfer efficiency (TTE, ratio of production rates between adjacent trophic levels) is 10% and the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) is fixed at 10(4). Here we provide evidence from four multi-trophic lake food webs that empirically estimated TTEs correspond to empirically estimated slopes of the respective community NBSS. Each of the NBSS considered pelagic and benthic organisms spanning size ranges from bacteria to fish, all sampled over three seasons in 1 yr. The four NBSS slopes were significantly steeper than -1.0 (range -1.14 to -1.19, with 95% CIs excluding -1). The corresponding average TTEs were substantially lower than 10% in each of the four food webs (range 1.0% to 3.6%, mean 1.85%). The overall slope merging all biomass-size data pairs from the four systems (-1.17) was almost identical to the slope predicted from the arithmetic mean TTE of the four food webs (-1.18) assuming a constant PPMR of 10(4). Accordingly, our empirical data confirm the theoretically predicted quantitative relationship between TTE and the slope of the biomass-size distribution. Furthermore, we show that benthic and pelagic organisms can be merged into a community NBSS, but future studies have yet to explore potential differences in habitat-specific TTEs and PPMRs. We suggest that community NBSS may provide valuable information on the structure of food webs and their energetic pathways, and can result in improved accuracy of TTE-estimates.

Ecosystem responses to aquatic invasive species management: A synthesis of two decades of bigheaded carp suppression in a large river	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The invasion of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) or "bigheaded carps" has caused extensive ecological and economic harm throughout the Mississippi River and its tributaries. To prevent their continued spread upstream toward the Great Lakes, intense commercial harvest was implemented on the Illinois River, a large tributary that connects the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan. Since implementation, harvest has reduced densities at the invasion front while also presenting an opportunity to generate a synthesis on ecosystem resilience in the face of accelerating invasion. Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to recover after perturbation, was observed at local scales and within some taxa but has yet to manifest at a river-wide scale and often co-varied with abiotic environmental or seasonal factors. Thus, while intensive harvest has limited further spread of bigheaded carps, and evidence of additional secondary ecosystem benefits exists, opportunities remain to identify potential pathways that could spread such ecosystem benefits even farther.					; Casper, Andrew/B-3179-2013	, James/0000-0003-1155-1548; Casper, Andrew/0000-0003-3450-0209; Altenritter, Matthew/0000-0003-4308-2547; Maxson, Kristopher/0000-0002-7302-2599; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR 1	2022	305								114354	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114354		DEC 2021						34954679					WOS:000741922300006

Ecosystem engineering by mussels supports biodiversity and water clarity in a heavily polluted lake in Dhaka, Bangladesh	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater mussels (Unionida) are globally endangered but perform crucial ecosystem services in temperate ecosystems. Their status and role in tropical regions are poorly understood, resulting in a nearly complete lack of effort toward their conservation. Understanding mussel functions in developing countries is particularly important because costly interventions to restore habitat functionality are often infeasible. We investigated the role of mussels in the nearshore zone of Dhanmondi Lake, a narrow, polluted lake in central Dhaka, Bangladesh, during the dry season. Sampling at 50 sites 1 to 3 m from the shore revealed dense mussel populations, averaging 218 individuals (ind)/m(2) from 2 species (Lamellidens marginalis and Parreysia caerulea). Based on laboratory filtration rates and in-situ size-frequency distribution, we calculated that mussels filter the equivalent of the volume of the lake margins in 21 h. This filtration capacity appears to explain the lake's high water clarity (>2 m visibility during the dry season), despite copious nutrient availability for algal growth. Although it is heavily polluted, the near shore zone of the lake has a diverse macroinvertebrate fauna, featuring up to 16 invertebrate families/0.25 m(2). Strong positive correlations among mussel density, macroinvertebrate richness, and diversity were revealed through 2-min kick-samples, and indicate that mussels act as microhabitat engineers that promote localized biodiversity. Loss of mussel communities could result in further loss of ecosystem services, which would be costly to replace through other means. Moreover, our data suggest that mussel abundance may be used to identify sites of high macroinvertebrate biodiversity in tropical freshwaters and, thus, help to focus management efforts in the most cost-effective way.

This provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro-thermodynamics in related water bodies (e.g., lakes or reservoirs). Obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables (e.g., discharge and water temperature) requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes. However, this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions. In this paper, we introduce a feasible, robust, and open-source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles. The workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir, and is optimized in this study for four catchment-lake systems to help in their proactive management. We assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake (pseudo)observations (reanalysis). Precisely, we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill (performance or quality) of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events. We used the current seasonal climate forecast system (SEAS5) and reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time-scales over the locations of the four case studies (Europe and South of Australia), seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance (skill) for the atmospheric variables considered. Nevertheless, seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study. Moreover, seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs, which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability, and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies. Further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia (i.e., lead-in conditions).

The present study investigated the dynamic of toxic cyanobacteria and microcystin (MC) concentrations in the Tri An Reservoir (TAR), a tropical system in Vietnam, with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. The results of the qPCR quantification revealed thatMicrocystiswas the dominant group and the primary MC producer in the TAR. Potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria varied from 1.2 x 10(4)to 1.58 x 10(7)cells/mL, and the mean proportion of toxicMicrocystisto that of the total toxic cyanobacteria varied from 21 to 88%. Microcystin concentrations in raw water and sediment samples often peaked during June to October as blooms occurred and varied from 0.27 to 6.59 mu g/L and from 1.79 to 544.9 ng/g in wet weight, respectively. The results of this study indicated that conditions favoringMicrocystisproliferation lead to the selection of more toxic genotypes. Water temperature and light availability were not driving factor in the formation of TCBs in the TAR. However, the high loads of total nitrogen (TN), phosphate, and total phosphorus (TP) into the water via rainfall runoff in combination with a high total suspended solid (TSS) and decreased water level during the early months of the rainy seasons did lead to a shift inMicrocystisblooms and higher proportions of toxic genotypes ofMicrocystisin the TAR. This research may provide more insight into the occurrence mechanism of TCBs in tropical waters. The strategy to control TCB problems in tropical regions should be focused on these limnological and hydrological parameters, in addition to a reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loading.

Limitations of optical data associated with non-uniform and temporally variable spectral signatures suggested investigating alternative approaches towards a more consistent and reliable detection of water bodies. Multi-year (2005-2012) observations of SAR backscattered intensities at moderate resolution from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument were used in this study to generate an indicator of open permanent water bodies (SAR-WBI) for the year 2010 time frame and for all land surfaces excluding Antarctica and the Greenland ice sheet A first map of potential water bodies with a spatial resolution of 150 m was obtained with a global detection algorithm based on a set of thresholds applied to multi-temporal metrics of the SAR backscatter (temporal variability, TV, and minimum backscatter, MB). Local refinements were then used to reduce systematic commission and omission errors (4.6% of the total area mapped) due to the similarity of TV and MB over open water bodies and other land surface types primarily in cold and arid environments. The refinement rules are here explained by means of a detailed signature analysis of the SAR backscatter in such environments. The accuracy of the SAR-WBI was 80% when compared against 2078 manually interpreted footprints with a size of 150 x 150 m(2). Omission errors were primarily observed along coast- and shorelines whereas commission errors were associated with (i) ephemeral water bodies, (ii) seasonally inundated areas, and (iii) an incorrect choice of the local refinement.

SNR (Signal-To-Noise Ratio) Impact on Water Constituent Retrieval from Simulated Images of Optically Complex Amazon Lakes	REMOTE SENSING												Uncertainties in the estimates of water constituents are among the main issues concerning the orbital remote sensing of inland waters. Those uncertainties result from sensor design, atmosphere correction, model equations, and in situ conditions (cloud cover, lake size/shape, and adjacency effects). In the Amazon floodplain lakes, such uncertainties are amplified due to their seasonal dynamic. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the suitability of a sensor to cope with them and assess their impact on the algorithms for the retrieval of constituents. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the SNR on the Chl-a and TSS algorithms in four lakes located at Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (Amazonia, Brazil). Two data sets were simulated (noisy and noiseless spectra) based on in situ measurements and on sensor design (MSI/Sentinel-2, OLCI/Sentinel-3, and OLI/Landsat 8). The dataset was tested using three and four algorithms for TSS and Chl-a, respectively. The results showed that the impact of the SNR on each algorithm displayed similar patterns for both constituents. For additive and single band algorithms, the error amplitude is constant for the entire concentration range. However, for multiplicative algorithms, the error changes according to the model equation and the R-rs magnitude. Lastly, for the exponential algorithm, the retrieval amplitude is higher for a low concentration. The OLCI sensor has the best retrieval performance (error of up to 2 mu g/L for Chl-a and 3 mg/L for TSS). For MSI, the error of the additive and single band algorithms for TSS and Chl-a are low (up to 5 mg/L and 1 mu g/L, respectively); but for the multiplicative algorithm, the errors were above 10 mu g/L. The OLI simulation resulted in errors below 3 mg/L for TSS. However, the number and position of OLI bands restrict Chl-a retrieval. Sensor and algorithm selection need a comprehensive analysis of key factors such as sensor design, in situ conditions, water brightness (R-rs), and model equations before being applied for inland water studies.

The OLCI is important to the expansion of remote sensing monitoring of inland waters using water color satellite data. In this study, we developed a dual band ratio algorithm for the downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) for the waters of Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China, based on data measured during seven surveys conducted between 2008 and 2017 in combination with Sentinel-3A-OLCI data. The results show that: (1) Compared to the available K-d(490) estimation algorithms, the dual band ratio (681 nm/560 nm and 754 nm/560 nm) algorithm developed in this study had a higher estimation accuracy (N = 26, coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.81, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.99 m(-1) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 19.55%) and validation accuracy (N = 14, R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 1.06 m(-1) and MAPE = 27.30%), making it more suitable for turbid inland waters; (2) A comparison of the OLCI K-d(490) product and a similar Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product reveals a high consistency between the OLCI and MODIS products in terms of the spatial distribution of K-d(490). However, the OLCI product has a smoother spatial distribution and finer textural characteristics than the MODIS product and contains notably higher-quality data; (3) The K-d(490) values for Lake Taihu exhibit notable spatial and temporal variations. K-d(490) is higher in seasons with relatively high wind speeds and in open waters that are prone to wind- and wave-induced sediment resuspension. Finally, the Sentinel-3A-OLCI has a higher spatial resolution and is equipped with a relatively wide dynamic range of spectral bands suitable for inland waters.

Trophic niche overlap and abundance reveal potential impact of interspecific interactions on a reintroduced fish	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Conceptually, trophic niche overlap and species abundance can describe the strength and number of interspecific trophic interactions to determine the competitive impact on reintroduced species or other ecosystem changes. We use an example with young-of-year (YOY) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reintroductions to determine whether trophic niche overlaps and abundances limit restoration success. Using seasonal stable isotopes and abundance estimates for invertivorous fishes in three Lake Ontario tributaries, we assessed community isotopic structure, trophic niche overlap, and the impact of the niche overlap by incorporating relative abundance. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) YOY could be a strong competitor with a high trophic niche overlap with Atlantic salmon YOY, but at lower abundances relative to Atlantic salmon there is minimal impact. Stream resident fish communities appeared to partition resources across seasons such that abundant species had low trophic niche overlap to minimize overall competition with Atlantic salmon YOY given available resources, indicating niche complementarity. Through joint consideration of trophic overlap and abundance using our conceptual model, the competitive impact of community composition on a reintroduced species could be assessed.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2021	78	6					765	774		10.1139/cjfas-2020-0204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0204													WOS:000672233700013

The response and role of ice cover in lake-climate interactions	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												This paper reviews the current state of knowledge pertaining to the interactions of lake ice and climate. Lake ice has been shown to be sensitive to climate variability through observations and modelling, and both long-term and short-term trends have been identified from ice records. Ice phenology trends have typically been associated with variations in air temperatures while ice thickness trends tend to be associated more to changes in snow cover. The role of ice cover in the regional climate is less documented and with longer ice-free seasons possible as a result of changing climate conditions, especially at higher latitudes, the effects of lakes on their surrounding climate (such as increased evaporation, lake-effect snow and thermal moderation of surrounding areas, for example) can be expected to become more prominent. The inclusion of lakes and lake ice in climate modelling is an area of increased attention in recent studies. An important step in improving predictions of ice conditions in models is the assimilation of remote sensing data in areas where in-situ data is lacking, or non-representative of the lake conditions. The ability to accurately represent ice cover on lakes will be an important step in the improvement of global circulation models, regional climate models and numerical weather forecasting.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011; Brown, Laura/F-5932-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													0309-1333	1477-0296				OCT	2010	34	5					671	704		10.1177/0309133310375653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133310375653													WOS:000282047700005
J	Dai, X; Wan, RR; Yang, GS				Dai Xue; Wan Rongrong; Yang Guishan			Non-stationary water-level fluctuation in China's Poyang Lake and its interactions with Yangtze River	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Seasonal water-level fluctuations (WLF) play a dominate role in lacustrine ecosystems. River-lake interaction is a direct factor in changes of seasonal lake WLF, especially for those lakes naturally connected to upstream and downstream rivers. During the past decade, the modification of WLF in the Poyang Lake (the largest freshwater lake in China) has caused intensified flood and irrigation crises, reduced water availability, compromised water quality and extensive degradation of the lake ecosystem. There has been a conjecture as to whether the modification was caused by its interactions with Yangtze River. In this study, we investigated the variations of seasonal WLF in China's Poyang Lake by comparing the water levels during the four distinct seasons (the dry season, the rising season, the flood season, and the retreating season) before and after 2003 when the Three Gorge Dam operated. The Water Surface Slope (WSS) was used as a representative parameter to measure the changes in river-lake interaction and its impacts on seasonal WLF. The results showed that the magnitude of seasonal WLF has changed considerably since 2003; the seasonal WLF of the Poyang Lake have been significantly altered by the fact that the water levels both rise and retreat earlier in the season and lowered water levels in general. The fluctuations of river-lake interactions, in particular the changes during the retreating season, are mainly responsible for these variations in magnitude of seasonal WLF. This study demonstrates that WSS is a representative parameter to denote river-lake interactions, and the results indicate that more emphasis should be placed on the decrease of the Poyang Lake caused by the lowered water levels of the Yangtze River, especially in the retreating season.					dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024														1009-637X	1861-9568				MAR	2015	25	3					274	288		10.1007/s11442-015-1167-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-015-1167-x													WOS:000348264000002

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water diversion has been applied increasingly to promote the exchange of lake water and to control eutrophication of lakes. The accelerated water exchange and mass transport by water diversion can usually be represented by water age. But the responses of water quality after water diversion is still disputed. The reliability of using water age for evaluating the effectiveness of water diversion projects in eutrophic lakes should be thereby explored further. Lake Dianchi, a semi-closed plateau lake in China, has suffered severe eutrophication since the 1980s, and it is one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. There was no significant improvement in water quality after an investment of approximately 7.7 billion USD and numerous project efforts from 1996 to 2015. After the approval of the Chinese State Council, water has been transferred to Lake Dianchi to alleviate eutrophication since December 2013. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model and eight scenarios were developed in this study to quantity the influence of this water diversion project on water quality in Lake Dianchi. The model results showed that (a) Water quality (TP, TN, and Chla) could be improved by 13.5-32.2%, much lower than the approximate 50% reduction in water age; (b) Water exchange had a strong positive relationship with mean TP, and mean Chla had exactly the same response to water diversion as mean TN; (c) Water level was more beneficial for improving hydrodynamic and nutrient concentrations than variation in the diverted inflowing water volume; (d) The water diversion scenario of doubling the diverted inflow rate in the wet season with the water level of 1886.5 m and 1887 m in the remaining months was the best water diversion mode for mean hydrodynamics and TP, but the scenario of doubling the diverted inflow rate in the wet season with 1887 m throughout the year was optimum for mean TN and Chla; (e) Water age influenced the effectiveness of water diversion on the improvement in TP, but not in TN and Chla. Therefore, water age solely could not be used to evaluate the restoration of water quality in a eutrophic lake, because geobiochemical processes played a more important role in the growth of algae than did water exchange in Lake Dianchi.

Seasonal Dynamics in Dissolved Organic Matter, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Cyanobacterial Blooms in Lake Erie	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been suggested to influence cyanobacterial community structure and toxicity. However, no study has investigated H2O2 concentrations in freshwaters relative to cyanobacterial blooms when sources and sinks of H2O2 may be highly variable. For example, photochemical production of H2O2 from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) may vary over the course of the bloom with changing CDOM and UV light in the water column, while microbial sources and sinks of H2O2 may change with community biomass and composition. To assess relationships between H2O2 and harmful algal blooms dominated by toxic cyanobacteria in the western basin of Lake Erie, we measured H2O2 weekly at six stations from June to November, 2014 and 2015, with supporting physical, chemical, and biological water quality data. Nine additional stations across the western, eastern, and central basins of Lake Erie were sampled during August and October, 2015. CDOM sources were quantified from the fluorescence fraction of CDOM using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). CDOM concentration and source were significantly correlated with specific conductivity, demonstrating that discharge of terrestrially-derived CDOM from rivers can be tracked in the lake. Autochthonous sources of CDOM in the lake increased over the course of the blooms. Concentrations of H2O2 in Lake Erie ranged from 47 +/- 16 nM to 1570 +/- 16 nM (average of 371 +/- 17 nM; n = 225), and were not correlated to CDOM concentration or source, UV light, or estimates of photochemical production of H2O2 by CDOM. Temporal patterns in H2O2 were more closely aligned with bloom dynamics in the lake. In 2014 and 2015, maximum concentrations of H2O2 were observed prior to peak water column respiration and chlorophyll a, coinciding with the onset of the widespread Microcystis blooms in late July. The spatial and temporal patterns in H2O2 concentrations suggested that production and decay of H2O2 from aquatic microorganisms can be greater than photochemical production of H2O2 from CDOM and abiotic decay pathways. Our study measured H2O2 concentrations in the range where physiological impacts on cyanobacteria have been reported, suggesting that H2O2 could influence the structure and function of cyanobacterial communities in Lake Erie.

In particular, when applied to Eukaryotes, we are still lacking a rigorous comparison of morphological and NGS-based diversity estimates. In this report, we studied the diversity and the seasonal community turnover of alveolates (Ciliophora and Dinophyceae) in an oligotrophic freshwater lake by SSU amplicon sequencing with NGS as well as by classical morphological analysis. We complemented the morphological analysis by single-cell PCR followed by Sanger sequencing to provide an unambiguous link to the NGS data. We show that NGS and morphological analyses generally capture frequency shifts of abundant taxa over our seasonal samples. The observed incongruencies are probably largely due to rDNA copy number variation among taxa and heterogeneity in the efficiency of cell lysis. Overall, NGS-based amplicon sequencing was superior in detecting rare species. We propose that in the absence of other nuclear markers less susceptible to copy number variation, rDNA-based diversity studies need to be adjusted for confounding effects of copy number variation.

Herein, we investigated the GHGs distribution in an aquifer, located upstream of Baiyangdian Lake, China, with a distinctive salinity gradient. A total of 132 groundwater samples were collected from 44 new-constructed wells along the lateral dimensions, and analyzed for dissolved GHGs concentrations, physiochemical parameters, and isotopes. The results showed that the dissolved CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations ranged from 9.47 to 79.3 mg/L, 1.05-56.9 mu g/L, and 0.84-7.03 mu g/L, respectively. The groundwater was supersaturated with GHGs with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, suggesting groundwater discharge as a potential source of GHGs emission. CO2 significantly decreased while CH4 and N2O distinctively increased with the decline of total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration, illustrating an obvious spatial pattern in the GHGs distribution. The CO2 distributions mainly depended on the bicarbonate radical and TDS, indicating carbonate equilibrium as the main process involving in the CO2 generation. CH4 and N2O was primarily generated through the methanogenesis and denitrification processes, respectively. Nutrients including SO42- and total organic carbon predominately shaped the CH4 distributions, while nitrate mainly governed the N2O dis-tributions. Our study highlights the important roles of hydrochemistry and nutrients in the GHGs generation and distributions, which provides a significant insight on managing the GHGs emissions from the saline groundwater.

Geomorphological impacts of a glacier lake outburst flood in the high arctic Zackenberg River, NE Greenland	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially those in the Arctic, can deliver exceptionally high volumes of sediment and solutes to fjords and shallow-marine settings, in comparison to typical seasonal river flows. These sediments and solutes strongly affect coastal geomorphology and aquatic ecosystems, yet are rarely observed. In this study, we have quantified the short-term geomorphological response of the most distal part of the Zackenberg River (northeast Greenland), where it enters Young Sund, to a glacier lake outburst flood that occurred on August 6th 2017. The main aims were to: (1) quantify riverbank and floodplain geomorphology changes that occurred as a consequence of the flood; (2) analyse the spatial patterns of those geomorphological changes and suggest the key controls on them. We used a time-series of very high-resolution UAV-generated images taken on the 5th, 6th, and 8th of August 2017, which enabled us to compare pre- and post-flood fluvial geomorphology. The GLOF induced intense and widespread geomorphological changes, which was surprising because several floods of a similar magnitude have occurred along this river. Approximately 30% of the area of interest experienced changes that were larger than the minimum level of detection (0.15 m). Lateral erosion reached almost 10 m in some places. The total volume loss from bank erosion was at least 26,561 m(3) (+/-14%), whereas the deposition was at least 7745 m(3) (+/- 39%). Such an intensive geomorphological response resulted from a combination of factors; namely: (1) bank geometry; (2) composition of bank material; (3) time of occurrence of the event; (4) presence of permafrost; (6) channel geometry; and (7) multitude and diversity of geomorphological processes. We speculate the severity of the geomorphological impact relative to that from previous floods could have been due to warming air temperatures that provided sediment from thawed permafrost, and to an aggrading delta that raised the river base level. Overall, we contend that climate warming will not only make outburst floods from glaciers more likely but that those floods will achieve more geomorphological work with mechanical erosion of permafrost. Erosion and gravitational failures during future flood events will perhaps become even more widespread and intense.

Assessment of Guar Gum Biopolymer Treatment Toward Mitigation of Desiccation Cracking on Slopes Built with Expansive Soils	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												Expansive soil embankments are prone to shallow slope failures caused by associated swell-shrink movements. Previous studies have confirmed that seasonal changes and corresponding volumetric changes are responsible for desiccation cracking, which is a major factor behind shallow slope failures of highway embankments. For the past few years, soil stabilization proved to be an effective way to mitigate the swell-shrink property of expansive clays. The current study addresses the feasibility of guar gum biopolymer in mitigating the swell-shrink behavior of clays and in turn making it possible to adopt them as stable geomaterials. The sustainable benefits of biopolymers far exceed the environmental benefits from conventional stabilizers that contractors typically use. This paper presents a comprehensive laboratory study, followed by finite difference modeling analysis, on biopolymeric guar gum-remediated expansive soils collected from shallow slope failure-prone areas. For this study, two dam locations, at Grapevine Lake and Joe Pool Lake, Texas, that were originally constructed with expansive soils, were considered. The engineering performance of biopolymer-treated soils was evaluated and an optimum dosage was recommended for mitigating desiccation cracking at the test sites. Slope stability analyses were conducted using Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua in Three Dimensions software by adopting laboratory-determined strength parameters to determine the range of the factor of safety for the slopes. The variation of the factor of safety computed with the inclusion of enhanced engineering parameters from guar gum treatments revealed the advantages of adopting this treatment.					; Puppala, Anand/AAP-1711-2021	Puppala, Anand/0000-0003-0435-6285; Bheemasetti, Tejo Vikash/0000-0002-2592-7836; 													0361-1981	2169-4052					2017		2657					78	88		10.3141/2657-09	http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2657-09													WOS:000413604000009

In the dry and wet seasons, water samples were collected and analyzed for 15 antibiotics. The results indicated that 14 antibiotics, excluding leucomycin, were detected. Monsoon led to significantly lower total antibiotic concentrations in the wet season (22.0ngL-1) than in the dry season (51.2ngL-1). Total antibiotic concentrations were dominated by amoxicillin (below limit of detection (<LOD)-34.7ngL-1)), erythromycin-H2O (<LOD-14.7ngL-1), roxithromycin (<LOD-27.9ngL-1), and trimethoprim (<LOD-6.34ngL-1). The total antibiotic concentrations were usually higher in the downstream areas of urban land than in the river reaches of forest land and agricultural land. At county or city scales, total antibiotic concentrations in the dry season were significantly correlated with the rural population, public budget, husbandry product and output, effluent volume, fishery product and output, and hospital number, which generally depend on land use in the basin. Amoxicillin poses a high ecological risk to aquatic algae, whereas erythromycin-H2O, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin pose medium ecological risks. However, trimethoprim poses a medium ecological risk to mollusks. These results provide improved insights into the characteristics of antibiotic occurrence and ecological risks in the waters of low-urbanized and rural areas in China and can be extrapolated worldwide.

J	Migaszewski, ZM; Galuszka, A; Dolegowska, S				Migaszewski, Zdzislaw M.; Galuszka, Agnieszka; Dolegowska, Sabina			Arsenic in the Wisniowka acid mine drainage area (south-central Poland) Mineralogy, hydrogeochemistry, remediation	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												This paper summarizes different aspects of arsenic mineralogy and geochemistry in the Wisniowka acid mine drainage (AMD) area, south-central Poland. The basic source of this metalloid in AMD water bodies is micro-grained pyrite that forms two different mineralized zones within the Upper Cambrian rock formation. Due to specific textural and geochemical characteristics, this mineral undergoes rapid oxidation on exposed quarry walls and unvegetated tailings piles, thus contributing to elevated arsenic concentrations in acid pit lakes and ponds, and locally intermittent pools. The latter were highlighted by the highest As levels reaching even 370 mg/L. Of the three AMD large reservoirs, the Podwisniowka (eastern) lake revealed distinctly raised As concentrations varying from 7.02 to 22.2 mg/L. Another interesting water body is the Marczakowe Doly acid pond showing diverse seasonal As concentration patterns in colloids and a water column. Results of geochemical modeling showed that the saturation indices (SI) of hematite and goethite exhibited the highest values (range of 6.96 to 12.84 and 2.47 to 5.39, respectively) tending to precipitate in all the water bodies examined. In addition, the positive SI values of nanosized epsilon-Fe2O3 (1.64 to 4.13) and schwertmannite (0.90 to 2.10) were found only in the Wisniowka Duza and Marczakowe Doly acid waters. Laboratory experiments revealed that the best chemical and cost-effective method (out of the limited number of options) of arsenic removal from the AMD waters examined was the use of high-grade powdered limestone (fraction 0.0-0.09 mm) or more effective although more expensive limewater (calcium hydroxide). The positive SI values of hematite, goethite, epsilon-Fe2O3 and schwertmannite of neutralized solutions suggest that these minerals should precipitate. Due to diverse concentrations in the examined rock series, arsenic has been used for fingerprinting "hot" places within the mining and neighboring areas, as well as for predicting the directions and effects of strip mining for quartzites. The As signature can also be applied to monitor a detrimental AMD impact on local surface and underground waters.					; Migaszewski, Zdzisław/D-5687-2011; Gałuszka, Agnieszka/D-5434-2011	Dolegowska, Sabina/0000-0001-7797-1292; Migaszewski, Zdzislaw/0000-0001-5549-6224; Galuszka, Agnieszka/0000-0002-2497-2627; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				AUG 20	2018	493						491	503		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.06.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.06.027													WOS:000439574000040

Particulate-bound Hg in the water column of EFPC within the Y-12 National Security Complex, was isotopically similar to average metallic Hg(0) used in industry, having a mean delta(202) Hg value of -0.42 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand (1SD) and near-zero Delta(199) Hg. On average, particulate fraction delta(2)(02) Hg values increased downstream by 0.53 parts per thousand, while Delta(199) Hg decreased by -0.10 parts per thousand, converging with the Hg isotopic composition of the fine fraction of streambed sediment along the 26 km flow path. The dissolved fraction behaved differently. Although initial Delta(199) Hg values of the dissolved fraction were also near-zero, these values increased transiently along the flow path. Initial delta(202) Hg values of the dissolved fraction were more variable than in the particulate fraction, ranging from -0.44 to 0.18 parts per thousand among three seasonal sampling campaigns, but converged to an average delta(202) Hg value of 0.01 +/- 0.10 parts per thousand (1SD) downstream. Dissolved Hg in the hyporheic and riparian pore water had higher and lower delta(202) Hg values, respectively, compared to dissolved Hg in stream water. Variations in Hg isotopic composition of the dissolved and suspended fractions along the flow path suggest that: (1) physical processes such as dilution and sedimentation do not fully explain decreases in total mercury concentrations along the flow path; (2) in-stream processes include photochemical reduction, but microbial reduction is likely more dominant; and (3) additional sources of dissolved mercury inputs to EFPC at baseflow during this study predominantly arise from the hyporheic zone.

From Bacteria to Fish: Ecological Consequences of Seasonal Hypoxia in a Great Lakes Estuary	ECOSYSTEMS												The occurrence of bottom-water hypoxia is increasing in bodies of water around the world. Hypoxia is of concern due to the way it negatively impacts lakes and estuaries at the whole ecosystem level. During 2015, we examined the influence of hypoxia on the Muskegon Lake ecosystem by collecting surface- and bottom-water nutrient samples, bacterial abundance counts, benthic fish community information, and performing profiles of chlorophyll and phycocyanin as proxies for phytoplankton and cyanobacterial growth, respectively. Several significant changes occurred in the bottom waters of the Muskegon Lake ecosystem as a result of hypoxia. Lake-wide concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus increased with decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO). Bacterial abundance was significantly lower when DO was less than 2.2 mg L-1. Whereas there were no drastic changes in surface chlorophyll a concentration through the season, phycocyanin increased threefold during and following a series of major wind-mixing events. Phycocyanin remained elevated for over 1.5 months despite several strong wind events, suggesting that high SRP concentrations in the bottom waters may have mixed into the surface waters, sustaining the bloom. The fish assemblage in the hypolimnion also changed in association with hypoxia. Overall fish abundance, number of species, and maximum length all decreased in catch as a function of bottom DO concentrations. The link between hypoxia and wind events appears to serve as a positive feedback loop by continuing internal loading and cyanobacterial blooms in the lake, while simultaneously eroding habitat quality for benthic fish.

In this study, we opted to determine the trematode infection of freshwater snails in the Omo-Gibe River Basin, southwest Ethiopia. Methods We collected snail samples from 130 observation sites in lakes, wetlands, rivers, reservoirs and irrigation canals surveyed during the dry season (March to May) in 2016. The snail samples were examined for trematode infections by cercarial shedding immediately after collection. Habitat conditions, water quality, human water contact practices and other human activities were assessed at each survey site. A redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to examine the relationship between cercarial infection and environmental variables. The statistical significance of eigenvalues and cercariae-environment correlations generated by the RDA were tested using Monte Carlo permutations at 499 permutations. Results A total of 3107 snails belonging to five species were collected. The most abundant species was Biomphalaria pfeifferi, representing 66% of the total collection. Overall, 109 (3.6%) of the snails were found infected with trematodes (cercariae). Biomphalaria pfeifferi was found to be the most highly infected, accounting 85% of all infected snails. A total of eight morphologically different types of cercariae were recorded, which included: Echinostoma cercariae, brevifurcate apharyngeate distome cercariae, amphistome cercariae, brevifurcate apharyngeate monostome cercariae, xiphidiocercariae, longifurcate pharyngeate distome cercariae, strigea cercariae and unidentified cercariae. Brevifurcate apharyngeate distome cercariae, and Echinostoma cercariae were the most abundant cercariae, accounting for 36 and 34% of all infection, respectively. The mean concentration of water conductivity and 5 days biological oxygen demand were higher in irrigation canals and lake sampling points. Human activities such as open field defecation, urination, livestock grazing, farming, and swimming were highly correlated with trematode infection. Conclusions The abundance, occurrence and infection rates of snail species were largely influenced by water physicochemical quality, sanitation and water contact behaviour of the inhabitants. Human activities, such as open field defecation and urination, livestock grazing, farming, and swimming were important predictors of the abundance of cercariae. Therefore, awareness creation should be implemented for proper containment of excreta (urine and faeces) and reducing human and animal contacts with surface waters to reduce snail-borne disease transmission.					; Mereta, Seid Tiku/HIA-0661-2022; Abdie, Yihun/AAI-3203-2020	Mereta, Seid Tiku/0000-0001-8036-4995; 													2095-5162	2049-9957				NOV 20	2019	8	1							93	10.1186/s40249-019-0604-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-019-0604-y								31744539					WOS:000498188100001

Nitrogen cycling in Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie: oscillations between strong and weak export and implications for harmful algal blooms	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Recent global water quality crises point to an urgent need for greater understanding of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) and their drivers. Nearshore areas of Lake Erie such as Sandusky Bay may become seasonally limited by nitrogen (N) and are characterized by distinct cHAB compositions (i.e., Planktothrix over Microcystis). This study investigated phytoplankton N uptake pathways, determined drivers of N depletion, and characterized the N budget in Sandusky Bay. Nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) uptake, N fixation, and N removal processes were quantified by stable isotopic approaches. Dissimilatory N reduction was a relatively modest N sink, with denitrification, anammox, and N2O production accounting for 84, 14, and 2% of sediment N removal, respectively. Phytoplankton assimilation was the dominant N uptake mechanism, and NO3- uptake rates were higher than NH4+ uptake rates. Riverine N loading was sometimes insufficient to meet assimilatory and dissimilatory demands, but N fixation alleviated this deficit. N fixation made up 23.7-85.4% of total phytoplankton N acquisition and indirectly supports Planktothrix blooms. However, N fixation rates were surprisingly uncorrelated with NO3- or NH4+ concentrations. Owing to temporal separation in sources and sinks of N to Lake Erie, Sandusky Bay oscillates between a conduit and a filter of downstream N loading to Lake Erie, delivering extensively recycled forms of N during periods of low export. Drowned river mouths such as Sandusky Bay are mediators of downstream N loading, but climate-change-induced increases in precipitation and N loading will likely intensify N export from these systems.					; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017	Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; Chaffin, Justin/0000-0002-5372-4577; Salk, Kateri/0000-0002-9967-2856; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371													1726-4170	1726-4189				MAY 16	2018	15	9					2891	2907		10.5194/bg-15-2891-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2891-2018													WOS:000432359600002
J	Lane, CR; D'Amico, E				Lane, Charles R.; D'Amico, Ellen			IDENTIFICATION OF PUTATIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS OF THE CONTERMINOUS UNITED STATES	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are wetlands completely surrounded by uplands. While common throughout the United States (U.S.), there have heretofore been no nationally available, spatially explicit estimates of GIW extent, complicating efforts to understand the myriad biogeochemical, hydrological, and habitat functions of GIWs and hampering conservation and management efforts at local, state, and national scales. We used a 10-m geospatial buffer as a proxy for hydrological or ecological connectivity of National Wetlands Inventory palustrine and lacustrine wetland systems to nationally mapped and available stream, river, and lake data. We identified over 8.3 million putative GIWs across the conterminous U.S., encompassing nearly 6.5 million hectares of wetland resources (average size 0.79 +/- 4.81 ha, median size 0.19 ha). Putative GIWs thus represent approximately 16% of the freshwater wetlands of the conterminous U.S. The water regime for the majority of the putative GIWs was temporarily or seasonally flooded, suggesting a vulnerability to ditching or hydrologic abstraction, sedimentation, or alterations in precipitation patterns. Additional analytical applications of this readily available geospatially explicit mapping product (e.g., hydrological modeling, amphibian metapopulation, or landscape ecological analyses) will improve our understanding of the abundance and extent, effect, connectivity, and relative importance of GIWs to other aquatic systems of the conterminous U.S.						D'Amico, Ellen/0000-0002-3248-1000; Lane, Charles/0000-0003-0066-8919													1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2016	52	3					705	722		10.1111/1752-1688.12421	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12421													WOS:000385007100010

The emission coefficient to treated wastewater was 291 gCO(2) m(-3). The main source of GHGs was CO2 from the consumption of electricity, nitrous oxide from the sludge incineration process, and methane from the water treatment process. They accounted for 43.4%, 41.7% and 8.3% of the total amount of GHGs emissions, respectively. The amount of methane was plotted as a function of water temperature ranging between 13.3 and 27.3 degrees C. An aeration tank was the main source of methane emission from all the units. Almost all the methane was emitted from the aeration tank, which accounted for 86.4% of the total gaseous methane emission. However, 18.4% of the methane was produced in sewage lines, 15.4% in the primary sedimentation tank, and 60.0% in the aeration tank. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Water color is measured in traditional water quality observations and characterized by the Forel-Ule scale, as it is intimately related to water compositions. In this paper, a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based water color extraction and classification approach is developed and applied to Lake Taihu. By using MODIS data together with field data, we attempted to 1) retrieve the dominant wavelength of water color and classify water color into FU-classes; 2) analyze the relationship between water color dominant wavelength and the abundance of optically active component (OACs) in water; and 3) discover seasonal variations of water color based on Lake Taihu. Our results show that the dominant wavelength exhibits some relationship with the three types of OAC concentrations under certain conditions, particularly TSM and Chl-a; inorganic suspended matter (ISM) can be retrieved by using MODIS derived dominant wavelength in appropriate water body. Moreover, differences in water quality for different seasons can be detected by dominant wavelength and FU-class with some prior knowledge of the studied water. Therefore, dominant wavelength may be used as a comprehensive and promising indicator of water quality situation even though much work has to be done in the future to optimize the analyses and verify it on diverse sites.

Conventional methods used to monitor these events are often unable to assess the spawning activity directly or can be invasive and therefore problematic. This is especially the case when threatened fish populations are the study subject, such as the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) populations in Windermere (Cumbria, UK). Arctic charr populations have been studied in this lake since the 1940s, and the locations and characteristics of spawning grounds have been described in detail using techniques such as hydroacoustics, as well as physical and visual surveys of the lake bottom. Here, in conjunction with established netting surveys, we added an environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach to assess the spatial distribution of Arctic charr in the lake throughout the year to test whether this tool could allow us to identify spawning locations and activity. Sampling was carried out between October 2017 and July 2018 at three locations in the lake, covering putative and known spawning sites. eDNA metabarcoding provided accurate spatial and temporal characterization of Arctic charr spawning events. Peaks of Arctic charr relative read counts from eDNA metabarcoding were observed during the spawning season and at specific locations of both putative and known spawning sites. Net catches of mature Arctic charr individuals confirmed the association between the Arctic charr spawning activity and the peaks of eDNA metabarcoding relative read counts. This study demonstrates the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to effectively and efficiently characterize the spatial and temporal nature of fish spawning in lentic systems.					; Harper, Lynsey/AAQ-2705-2020; Bean, Colin/A-5720-2011; Winfield, Ian/I-6085-2012; Di Muri, Cristina/GSN-8197-2022	Li, Jianlong/0000-0002-0302-0061; Lawson Handley, Lori/0000-0002-8153-5511; Bean, Colin/0000-0003-3502-0995; Hanfling, Bernd/0000-0001-7630-9360; Winfield, Ian/0000-0001-9296-5114; Di Muri, Cristina/0000-0003-4072-0662													2637-4943					SEP	2023	5	5			SI		849	860		10.1002/edn3.343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/edn3.343													WOS:001306413900009
J	Giresse, P; Maley, J; Chepstow-Lusty, A				Giresse, Pierre; Maley, Jean; Chepstow-Lusty, Alex			Understanding the 2500 yr BP rainforest crisis in West and Central Africa in the framework of the Late Holocene: Pluridisciplinary analysis and multi-archive reconstruction	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Numerous palaeoclimatic and prehistoric reconstructions have been reported at both the local scale and across the very large area of tropical Central Africa, clearly highlighting the Late Holocene Rainforest Crisis (LHRC) which mainly developed from ca. 2500 to 2000 yr BP. The broad synchroneity of this interval is striking and has been revealed in many different deep lakes from humid or montane forest, lakes or swamps marginal to tropical forest, and swamp forests where the oscillations of the surface water table produce temporary emersions. In parallel, a chronological review is presented of the Bantu arrival in these areas, including indicators for burning, metallurgy and land clearance. Nevertheless, evidence of human occupation, such as artefacts or deposits containing charcoal is exceptional and generally absent in most areas. Although the archaeological data exhibit a gradual southward densification of human occupation throughout Central Africa, the increase of settlements clearly began after 2350 yr BP, not before 2500 BP. However, some authors have interpreted the geochemical signal of increased erosion in the Congo Basin or the opening up of the forest around Lake Barombi Mbo in Cameroon as being attributed to agricultural clearance, or even the supply of charcoal required for metallurgy. In short, these early Bantu settlers (in such modest densities) may have been responsible for some local landscape degradation (clearance, fire, metallurgy), but these same settlers could not, under any circumstances and across all Central Africa, be held responsible directly or indirectly for the synchronous changes of lake levels, draining vast swamps and opening up of the tropical forest canopy, which was due to an increased dry season, while the recovery with the recolonization of light demanding species, including oil palms (Elaeis guineensis) assisted by dispersers such as chimpanzees, was likewise due to natural processes. Therefore, it can be concluded that no data available validate the hypothesis that the major erosion or vegetation destruction ca. 2500 yr BP, was the result of large population movements. Indeed, the evolution of the environments of Central Africa are linked to the natural responses induced by general palaeoclimatic processes, observed synchronously not only in northern and eastern Africa, but globally. The natural recovery and resilience of these forests until the last centuries contrasts with the situation currently being faced.					alexchepstow@gmail.com, Alex/AAV-5258-2021														0921-8181	1872-6364				SEP	2020	192								103257	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103257													WOS:000551998100018

Climate and productivity affect total mercury concentration and bioaccumulation rate of fish along a spatial gradient of subarctic lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate change is resulting in increased temperatures and precipitation in subarctic regions of Europe. These changes are extending tree lines to higher altitudes and latitudes, and enhancing tree growth enabling intensification of forestry into previously inhospitable subarctic regions. The combined effects of climate change and land-use intensification extend the warm, open-water season in subarctic lakes and increase lake productivity and may also increase leaching andmethylation activity of mercury within the lakes. To assess the joint effects of climate and productivity on total mercury (THg) bioaccumulation in fish, we conducted a space-for-time substitution study in 18 tributary lakes of a subarcticwatercourse forming a gradient fromcold pristine oligotrophic lakes in the northern headwaters to warmer and increasingly human-altered mesotrophic and eutrophic systems in the southern lower reaches. Increasing temperature, precipitation, and lake productivity were predicted to elevate length-and age-adjusted THg concentrations, as well as THg bioaccumulation rate (the rate of THg bioaccumulation relative to length or age) in muscle tissue of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), vendace (Coregonus albula), perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua). A significant positive relationship was observed between age-adjusted THg concentration and lake climateproductivity in vendace (r(2) = 0.50), perch (r(2) = 0.51), pike (r(2) = 0.55) and roach (r(2) = 0.61). Higher climate-productivity values of the lakes also had a positive linear (pike; r(2) = 0.40 and whitefish; r(2)= 0.72) or u-shaped (perch; r(2) = 0.64 and ruffe; r(2) = 0.50) relationship with THg bioaccumulation rate. Our findings of increased adjusted THg concentrations in planktivores and piscivores reveal adverse effects of warming climate and increasing productivity on these subarctic fishes, whereas less distinct trends in THg bioaccumulation rate suggest more complex underlying processes. Joint environmental stressors such as climate and productivity should be considered in ongoing and future monitoring of mercury concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite the advantages gained from FPVs, it can still suffer from radiation fluctuation, which severely harms the system's production. Avoiding such obstacles can help countries like Egypt to increase their clean electricity production from its huge natural Northern Lakes. The adoption of soft computing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms showed great potential for optimizing system performance, especially the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Yet insufficient memory and rapid radiation fluctuations can compromise algorithms. Hence, the present work addresses a hybrid GA-PSO algorithm combining the advantageous features of both algorisms to extract the MPPT from a 5.3 kW FPV system with greater frequency and accuracy in varying weather conditions, including partial shading (PS); MATLAB simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed system's potential under a range of weather conditions. The hybrid GA-PSO outperforms GA or PSO alone while being simple to implement, with an average electrical efficiency and performance ratio of (23.40%,0.87) and (18.90%,0.79) for FPV and partially shading PSFPV, respectively. Finally, by implementing the hybrid GA-PSO, the FPV array may prevent 17.52 tons of CO2/ season from being emitted into the air.					kabeel, Abd/AAB-4723-2021; Elminshawy, Nabil/AAD-3470-2019; Osama, Amr/AFM-0250-2022; elbaksawi, osama/HOH-8621-2023; Ahmed, Asmaa/G-8086-2017	Ahmed, Asmaa/0000-0001-8992-0169													0955-7997	1873-197X				APR	2024	161						226	246		10.1016/j.enganabound.2024.01.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enganabound.2024.01.022		FEB 2024											WOS:001180116800001
J	Wells, C; Ketcheson, S; Price, J				Wells, Corey; Ketcheson, Scott; Price, Jonathan			Hydrology of a wetland-dominated headwater basin in the Boreal Plain, Alberta, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study provides an in-depth analysis of the runoff generation dynamics and hydrological connectivity across upland-wetland transitions within a wetland-dominated headwater basin in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), Canada. Basin runoff response between and among years was driven largely by differences in the timing and magnitude of precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration, hence antecedent moisture conditions, which varied markedly over the four-year study (April-Sept). Runoff coefficients for individual precipitation events ranged from <1 to >90% depending on storm dynamics and antecedent conditions. Owing to its higher elevation, the basin received 55% more precipitation per month on average compared to 30-year climate normals and an average of 86 mm more precipitation per season than the nearby regional weather station. The wetland and adjacent forestlands became coupled during intermittent wet periods which generated substantial runoff. The findings of the current study suggest that, in contrast to conventional conceptual models, headwater catchments within the subhumid WBP have the capacity to generate significant runoff throughout the snow-free period.

J	Kalita, S; Sarma, HP; Devi, A				Kalita, Suravi; Sarma, Hari Prasad; Devi, Arundhuti			Sediment characterisation and spatial distribution of heavy metals in the sediment of a tropical freshwater wetland of Indo-Burmese province	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The sediment characterisation of wetlands belonging to the Northeastern Region of India particularly regarding the assessment of sediment carbon stock is very scanty. The presently available literature on the wetlands cannot be employed as a common model for managing the wetlands of the Northeastern Region of India as wetlands are a sensitive ecosystem with a different origin or endogenous interventions. Thereby, this research was conducted on Deepor Beel for investigating the spatial and seasonal variation of sediment parameters, the relationship between the parameters and pollution status of the wetland. Results revealed that the study area is of an acidic nature with a sandy clay loam type texture. Organic carbon, total nitrogen and available nitrogen were higher in sediments in the monsoon period. The mean stock of the sediment carbon pool of Deepor Beel is estimated to be 2.5 +/- 0.7 kg m(-2). The average non-residual fraction percentage (63.2%) of Pb was higher than the residual fraction. Zn content similar to 490 mg kg(-1) exceeding its effect range medium (ERM) was determined to suggest frequent biological adverse effects. Highest metal enrichment factor (EF) values were shown by Zn and Pb, which ranged between 78 and 255. Risk assessment code (RAC) values of Pb between 21 and 29% indicated its high bio-accessibility risk. Pearson's coefficient matrix revealed a low degree of positive correlation between organic carbon content and metal concentration. Principal component analysis revealed that the first component comprising of EC, basic cations and metals accounted for 623% of variance while the second component (OM, OC, TN, AN, AP) and the third component (pH) accounted for 21.8% and 7.0% of the variance, respectively. The present study revealed the adverse impact of human inputs on the Deepor Beel quality status. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study performed the lake sedimentary characteristics and paleontological data of the upper member of Bayingebi Formation (K(1)b(2)) of Lower Cretaceous in the Yin'e Basin (North China) and revealed the paleoclimate disturbances and the evolution of paleovegetation and paleoenvironment recorded in the continental lake. The sediments of K(1)b(2) can be divided into 10 kinds of lithofacies according to grain size, sedimentary structure and overall lithofacies. The three lithofacies associations are nearshore subaqueous fan, semi-deep lake/deep lake and shallow lake respectively. Seventy-eight palynomorph genera and two hundred and thirty-one palynomorph species were identified in the K(1)b(2) samples, which allowed distinguishing 3 palynozones. The sporopollen spectrum and the ecological characteristics of sporopollen parent plants indicate that there was abundant temperate coniferous forest vegetation during the deposition of Bayingebi Formation. The mixed phenomenon of a fewcold-loving molecular spores and pollen such as spruce, cedar and fir with tropical and subtropical spores and pollen suggest vertical zoning of plants. It is inferred that the ground shape and height difference around Yin'e Basin in Early Cretaceous is large, and there may be paleogeomorphic features of high mountains, and the paleoclimate has vertical zoning. The K(1)b(2) depositional period was mainly in the warm temperate-temperate paleoclimate background, and oil shale was mainly developed in the semi-humid warm temperate climate. The suitable paleotemperature and the sedimentary environment of semi-deep lake/deep lake provide rich organic matter sources and good preservation conditions for the formation of oil shale. The dropstone structures commonly found in the lower strata of the oil shale member of the Bayingebi Formation in the study area were deposited in a semi-humid temperate climate and were inferred to be ice-rafting deposits, which may be related to a brief climatic cooling event or seasonal freezing during the Early Cretaceous in northern China. The typical East Asian paleontological fossils (Jehol Biota) and lacustrine hydrocarbon source rocks developed in the Early Cretaceous in the study area were affected by the paleoclimate warming in the early Aptian, which was closely related to the increase of global CO2 concentration in this period.

The Latitudes, Attitudes, and Platitudes of Watershed Phosphorus Management in North America	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus (P) plays a crucial role in agriculture as a primary fertilizer nutrient-and as a cause of the eutrophication of surface waters. Despite decades of efforts to keep P on agricultural fields and reduce losses to waterways, frequent algal blooms persist, triggering not only ecological disruption but also economic, social, and political consequences. We investigate historical and persistent factors affecting agricultural P mitigation in a transect of major watersheds across North America: Lake Winnipeg, Lake Erie, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Okeechobee/Everglades. These water bodies span 26 degrees of latitude, from the cold climate of central Canada to the subtropics of the southeastern United States. These water bodies and their associated watersheds have tracked trajectories of P mitigation that manifest remarkable similarities, and all have faced challenges in the application of science to agricultural management that continue to this day. An evolution of knowledge and experience in watershed P mitigation calls into question uniform solutions as well as efforts to transfer strategies from other arenas. As a result, there is a need to admit to shortcomings of past approaches, plotting a future for watershed P mitigation that accepts the sometimes two-sided nature of Hennig Brandt's "Devil's Element."

J	Shi, W; Zhang, YL; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Zhang, Yunlin; Wang, Menghua			Deriving Total Suspended Matter Concentration from the Near-Infrared-Based Inherent Optical Properties over Turbid Waters: A Case Study in Lake Taihu	REMOTE SENSING												Normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(), particle backscattering coefficients b(bp)() in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, and total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations over turbid waters are analytically correlated. To demonstrate the use of b(bp)() in the NIR wavelengths in coastal and inland waters, we used in situ optics and TSM data to develop two TSM algorithms from measurements of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) using backscattering coefficients at the two NIR bands b(bp)(745) and b(bp)(862) for Lake Taihu. The correlation coefficients between the modeled TSM concentrations from b(bp)(745) and b(bp)(862) and the in situ TSM are 0.93 and 0.92, respectively. A different in situ dataset acquired between 2012 and 2016 for Lake Taihu was used to validate the performance of the NIR TSM algorithms for VIIRS-SNPP observations. TSM concentrations derived from VIIRS-SNPP observations with these two NIR b(bp)()-based TSM algorithms matched well with in situ TSM concentrations in Lake Taihu between 2012 and 2016. The normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs) for the two NIR algorithms are 0.234 and 0.226, respectively. The two NIR-based TSM algorithms are used to compute the satellite-derived TSM concentrations to study the seasonal and interannual variability of the TSM concentration in Lake Taihu between 2012 and 2016. In fact, the NIR-based TSM algorithms are analytically based with minimal in situ data to tune the coefficients. They are not sensitive to the possible nL(w)() saturation in the visible bands for highly turbid waters, and have the potential to be used for estimation of TSM concentrations in turbid waters with similar NIR nL(w)() spectra as those in Lake Taihu.

Development of a sensitivity analysis framework for aquatic biogeochemical models using machine learning	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Our evolving understanding of ecosystem functioning along with the advent of computational power have paved the way for the development of complex mathematical models that explicitly represent the functional diversity of biotic communities and multiple biogeochemical cycles. The ever-growing demand for more complex models underscores the importance of robust sensitivity analysis (SA) to elucidate the impact of the uncertainty on model inputs and to untangle the parameter covariance patterns that ultimately lead to the emergence of equifinality problems. In this study, we propose a novel multi-pronged SA framework that integrates advanced statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) is first applied to dissect the wide array of predictive outputs and identify modes of variability in time and/or space. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis is then used to identify a set of splitting decisions connecting threshold values of key state variables and model parameters with different ranges of predictive outputs with management interest. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are implemented as a final step to unravel any non-linear associations between model parameters and responses. As a proof-of-concept, we used a complex aquatic biogeochemical model developed for the Bay of Quinte, a eutrophic embayment in Lake Ontario, to examine competition patterns and structural shifts among multiple functional phytoplankton (diatoms, N-fixing cyanobacteria, and Microcystis) and zooplankton (herbivores and omnivores) groups. Our sensitivity analysis framework showed that the parameters representing the dependence of growth and metabolic processes on temperature are particularly influential to recreate plankton community dynamics during the cold period of the year, whereas the interplay among the interspecific resource competition, strength of the prey-predator interactions, and phosphorus availability mainly regulate their dynamics during the growing season. The growth strategies of diatoms, their nutritional quality that determines the assimilation efficiency by zooplankton, along with the ambient nutrient availability deter-mine our capacity to reproduce patterns of cyanobacteria dominance and faithfully depict the severity of harmful algal blooms. Finally, our study discusses the benefits of a broader use of the ML-based SA framework to unravel influential parametric interactions in modulating the behaviors of complex mathematical models.					; Shimoda, Yuko/I-3521-2017; Arhonditsis, George/AAI-7897-2020	Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				JUL	2023	75								102079	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102079		MAR 2023											WOS:000969908600001

However, the molecular compositions and characteristics of DOM in river-connected lakes are still poorly understood. Thus, here the spatial variations of optical properties and molecular characteristics of DOM in a large river-connected lake (Poyang Lake) were explored via spectroscopic tech-niques and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The results showed high degree of spatial heterogeneity of DOM chemistry (variations in DOC concentrations, optical parameters, and molecular com-pounds) in Poyang Lake, and the diversity at the molecular level was primarily caused by the heteroatom compounds (N-and S-containing). Compared with classic lakes and rivers, DOM compositions of the river-connected lake had dis-tinctive characteristics (differences in the AImod and DBE values, and CHOS proportions). And the composition charac-teristics of DOM between the southern and northern parts of Poyang Lake were different (such as the lability and molecular compounds), suggesting the changes of hydrologic conditions may affect the DOM chemistry. In addition, various sources of DOM (autochthonous, allochthonous, and anthropogenic inputs) were identified agreeably based on optical properties and molecular compounds. Overall, this study first characterizes the DOM chemistry and reveals its spatial variations in Poyang Lake at the molecular level, which could improve our understanding of DOM in large river-connected lake systems. Further studies are encouraged to investigate the seasonal variations of DOM chemistry under different hydrologic conditions in Poyang Lake to enrich the knowledge of carbon cycling in river-connected lake systems.

The Ordos Plateau, located in the north part of the Ordos Basin, is ideal to study the pattern of regional groundwater circulation induced by water-table undulations due to the wavy topography and the relatively simple aquifer systems with macroscopically homogeneous sandstone. In catchments located near the first-order divide, the water table is found to be a subdued replica of the topography, and the nonclosed water-table contours in topographic highs of a catchment are indicative of regional groundwater outflow to other catchments. In topographic lows, groundwater-fed lakes/rivers, topography-driven flowing wells, water-loving and/or salt-tolerant vegetation, and soap holes are all indicative of discharge areas. In discharge areas, although groundwater inflow from recharge areas is relatively stable, seasonal variations in groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration lead to significant seasonal fluctuations in the water table, which can be used to estimate groundwater inflow and evapotranspiration rates based on water balance at different stages of water-table change. In the lowest reaches of a complex basin, superposition of local flow systems on regional flow systems has been identified based on groundwater samples collected from wells with different depths and geophysical measurements of apparent resistivity, both of which can be used for characterizing groundwater flow systems. This study enhances understanding of the pattern of regional groundwater circulation in the Ordos Plateau, and also tests the effectiveness of methods for groundwater flow-system characterization.					wan, li/GRY-7634-2022; Zhao, Keyu/OMK-6021-2025; Jiang, Xiao-Wei/F-8288-2011; Zhang, Fuhua/KIB-2944-2024	Jiang, Xiao-Wei/0000-0002-7991-0757; Wang, Jun-Zhi/0000-0003-1978-9104													1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2018	26	5			SI		1657	1668		10.1007/s10040-018-1731-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1731-4													WOS:000439318900025
J	Migaszewski, ZM; Galuszka, A; Dolegowska, S				Migaszewski, Zdzislaw M.; Galuszka, Agnieszka; Dolegowska, Sabina			Stable isotope geochemistry of acid mine drainage from the Wisniowka area (south-central Poland)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												This paper presents the results of a current isotopic study of pyrite mineralization, acid mine drainage (AMD), and nearby rivers and farmer's wells located in the western part of the Main Range, Holy Cross Mountains (southcentral Poland). The principal source of dissolved sulfates in acid lakes, ponds and intermittent pools is the predominant microscopic-grained and locally framboidal pyrite (FeS2) that tends to oxidize rapidly on exposed quarry walls and unvegetated historic and current tailings piles. This process is expedited by the occurrence of arsenic in the pyrite crystal structure, which greatly decreases its resistance to weathering. The delta S-34 signature of pyrite from the Podwisniowka quarry (mean of -24.0 +/- 3.1 parts per thousand) was different from that of the Wisniowka Dua. quarry (mean of -17.4 +/- 7.2 parts per thousand). These values fingerprinted two basic pyrite mineralization zones assigned to lowermost and middle Upper Cambrian rock series, respectively. The delta S-34-FeS2 differences also were reflected in dissolved sulfates that displayed distinctly different delta S-34 values: -15.3 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand (Podwisniowka) and -10.0 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand (Wisniowka Dua.). These negative delta S-34 values stand in contrast to their positive equivalents of the Cambrian Main Range, as well as in the examined rivers and farmer's wells unaffected by AMD processes. The acid water bodies also displayed diverse seasonal variations of delta S-34-SO42-, delta O-18-SO42- and delta O-1(8)-H2O that were linked to surface area, site topography, exposition to radiation, changing weather patterns, especially temperature and a periodical influx of rainwater or meltwater. The isotope data also suggest that evaporation occurred after pyrite oxidation without a direct contact with lake/pond waters, which is also evidenced by the occurrence of sulfate efflorescences on Podwisniowka and Wisniowka quarry faces. The stable S, O and H isotopes have been employed for fingerprinting different geochemical processes and for assessing a potential impact of AMD waters on nearby rivers and local perched aquifers, particularly in case of no visual indications. The S isotope signatures of ponds and pools have also been used for determining the provenance of historic and recent mine waste material.

Vito			Nutrient Leaching in Soil Affected by Fertilizer Application and Frozen Ground	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Agricultural runoff containing P and N from drainage tiles contributes to nutrient loading in waterways, leading to downstream eutrophication. Recent studies suggest that nutrient losses through tile drains can be reduced if nutrients are applied in the subsurface. This study explored interactions between nutrient supply and infiltrating water during a simulated nongrowing season using a laboratory experiment to understand how water and nutrients move through partially frozen and unfrozen soil and if fertilizer placement influences NO3- and dissolved reactive P (DRP) leaching. Intact silt loam and clay soil monoliths (28 by 30 by 30 cm) were fertilized with P and N via subsurface placement or surface broadcast and subjected to simulated rainfall under unfrozen (10 degrees C) and partially frozen (similar to 0 degrees C) conditions. Conservative tracers (Br-, Cl-, and D2O) applied to characterize subsurface flow paths throughout a subset of events indicated that matrix flow dominated in unfrozen silt loam soil. However, preferential flow paths dominated in unfrozen clay and in both soil types under partially frozen conditions, transporting applied nutrients while minimizing contact with the soil matrix. The subsurface placement of inorganic fertilizer relative to surface broadcast reduced both NO3- (by 26.85 kg ha(-1) [23%] in silt loam and 65.73 kg ha(-1) [61%] in clay) and DRP losses (by 2.33 kg ha(-1) [60%] in silt loam and 4.25 kg ha(-1) [64%] in clay). This study demonstrates the advantage of subsurface placement of fertilizer in the reduction of nutrient leaching by limiting the interaction of the nutrient supply with preferential flow pathways.					; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024	Rezanezhad, Fereidoun/0000-0002-9608-8005; Macrae, Merrin/0000-0003-3296-3103													1539-1663					FEB 28	2019	18	1							180150	10.2136/vzj2018.08.0150	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2018.08.0150													WOS:000460020000001

A simple cloud-filling approach for remote sensing water cover assessments	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The empirical attribution of hydrologic change presents a unique data availability challenge in terms of establishing baseline prior conditions, as one cannot go back in time to retrospectively collect the necessary data. Although global remote sensing data can alleviate this challenge, most satellite missions are too recent to capture changes that happened long ago enough to provide sufficient observations for adequate statistical inference. In that context, the 4 decades of continuous global high-resolution monitoring enabled by the Landsat missions are an unrivaled source of information. However, constructing a time series of land cover observation across Landsat missions remains a significant challenge because cloud masking and inconsistent image quality complicate the automatized interpretation of optical imagery. Focusing on the monitoring of lake water extent, we present an automatized gap-filling approach to infer the class (wet or dry) of pixels masked by clouds or sensing errors. The classification outcome of unmasked pixels is compiled across images taken on different dates to estimate the inundation frequency of each pixel, based on the assumption that different pixels are masked at different times. The inundation frequency is then used to infer the inundation status of masked pixels on individual images through supervised classification. Applied to a variety of global lakes with substantial long term or seasonal fluctuations, the approach successfully captured water extent variations obtained from in situ gauges (where applicable), or from other Landsat missions during overlapping time periods. Although sensitive to classification errors in the input imagery, the gap-filling algorithm is straightforward to implement on Google's Earth Engine platform and stands as a scalable approach to reli-ably monitor, and ultimately attribute, historical changes in water bodies.

Correlates of Zooplankton Beta Diversity in Tropical Lake Systems	PLOS ONE												The changes in species composition between habitat patches (beta diversity) are likely related to a number of factors, including environmental heterogeneity, connectivity, disturbance and productivity. Here, we used data from aquatic environments in five Brazilian regions over two years and two seasons (rainy and dry seasons or high and low water level periods in floodplain lakes) in each year to test hypotheses underlying zooplankton beta diversity variation. The regions present different levels of hydrological connectivity, where three regions present lakes that are permanent and connected with the main river, while the water bodies of the other two regions consist of permanent lakes and temporary ponds, with no hydrological connections between them. We tested for relationships between zooplankton beta diversity and environmental heterogeneity, spatial extent, hydrological connectivity, seasonality, disturbance and productivity. Negative relationships were detected between zooplankton beta diversity and both hydrological connectivity and disturbance (periodic dry-outs). Hydrological connectivity is likely to affect beta diversity by facilitating dispersal between habitats. In addition, the harsh environmental filter imposed by disturbance selected for only a small portion of the species from the regional pool that were able to cope with periodic dry-outs (e.g., those with a high production of resting eggs).

The Sistan region in eastern Iran and the Registan region in Southwestern Afghanistan are strongly influenced by the wind of 120 days (Sadobist Roozeh wind), which is blowing along the Iran-Afghanistan border from North to South, then shifts it's direction toward the Southeast into the Sistan region and, finally, continues eastward into southwestern Afghanistan, forming the Registan sand seas. It blows during the hot season due to the pressure gradient between the Turkmenistan high and the Pakistan Low. In order to determine the wind regime and the sand transport, wind roses based on long-term datasets from 16 meteorological stations, the Drift Potential (DP), the Resultant Drift Direction (RDD), the Resultant Drift Potential (RDP) and the RDP/DP ratio have been calculated using the Fryberger (1979) method. The distribution of the Registan sand dunes was surveyed by using Landsat ETM data, Google Earth scenes and field operations (the latter only in the Iranian part). The spatial differences of the drift potential were also mapped using GIS and geostatistical methods overlaying the sand dune map. The results show that the drift potential (DP) increases from north to south along the border between Iran and Afghanistan and reaches to highest values in the Sistan region, then decreases gradually in the Registan sand seas. The highest wind energy, based on DP matches, was determined exactly where the ephemeral lakes in the northern part of the Sistan plain are located, which function as a source area of intense dust and sand storms during the dry season. The temporal trend of the DP showed an increase between 1999 and 2007, followed by a decrease until 2015 in Sistan. The results show that the wind regime in the Sistan and Registan regions is unimodal during the wind of 120 days (the Sadobist Roozeh) period, which is also supported by the dominance of transverse, barchanoid and barchans dunes in both regions.					; abbasi, hamidreza/U-7566-2017	Abbasi, Hamidreza/0000-0002-9976-8364; 													0372-8854						2019	62			1			41	57		10.1127/zfg_suppl/2019/0543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/zfg_suppl/2019/0543													WOS:000476620100003

The operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has had a great influence on downstream low flow in the Yangtze River. In this paper, the characteristics of low flow in the main Yangtze River were analyzed during the dry season before and after the TGD operation during the period of 1956-2016. The results show that: (1) the operation of the TGD has changed the spatial and temporal distribution of streamflow in the middle and lower Yangtze River and the annual mean low flow has increased significantly since the TGD operation. (2) The operation of the TGD could advance the date of the start of dry season in the lower Yangtze River basin. The start dates of the dry season in the Yichang, Hankou and Datong stations were advanced by 14 days, 10 days and 9 days, respectively. (3) The minimum streamflow in the lower Yangtze River has increased notably since the TGD operation. The minimum streamflow was raised by 42.91%, 13.76% and 6.06% at the Yichang, Hankou and Datong stations, respectively. The increasing number of dams in the world might have the potential effects on downstream low flow. More attention should be paid to investigating the influence of dam construction on low flow in rivers all over the world.					; Tian, Jiaxi/JPK-9602-2023; Tong, Jiang/KHD-8592-2024	ZHang, Zengxin/0000-0003-1823-6049; 													2073-4441					JAN	2019	11	1							65	10.3390/w11010065	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010065													WOS:000459735100064

MinION-based shotgun sequencing was used to comprehensively compare the microbial diversity and functional potential of xenobiotic degradation pathways with seasonal changes. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were prevalent bacterial phyla in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon samples. Functional analysis from SEED-subsystem and KEGG database revealed 28 subsystems and 18 metabolic pathways for the metabolism of aromatic compounds and xenobiotic biodegradation respectively. Occurrence of N-phenyl alkanoic, benzoate, biphenyl, chloroaromatic, naphthalene, and phenol degradation genes depicted varied abundance in the premonsoon and post-monsoon samples. Further, KEGG analysis indicated nitrotoluene degradation pathway (ko00633) abundant in post-monsoon samples, and the benzoate degradation pathway (ko00362) predominant in 19LN4S (pre-monsoon) than 18LN7S (post-monsoon) samples. The abundant genes for benzoate degradation were pcal: 3-oxoadipate CoA-transferase, alpha subunit, pcaH: protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, beta subunit, and pcaB: 3-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate cycloisomerase, and 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. This metagenomic study provides a unique blueprint of hitherto unexplored xenobiotic biodegradation genes/pathways in terms of seasonal variations in the Lonar Lake, and war- rants active exploitation of microbes for bioremediation purposes.

J	Koebsch, F; Jurasinski, G; Koch, M; Hofmann, J; Glatzel, S				Koebsch, Franziska; Jurasinski, Gerald; Koch, Marian; Hofmann, Joachim; Glatzel, Stephan			Controls for multi-scale temporal variation in ecosystem methane exchange during the growing season of a permanently inundated fen	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Wetlands are the largest natural sources for atmospheric methane (CH4). In wetlands with permanent shallow inundation, the seasonal variation of CH4 exchange is mainly controlled by temperature and phenology. In addition, ecosystem CH4 exchange varies considerably on smaller temporal scales such as days or weeks. Several single processes that control CH4 emissions on the local soil-plant-atmosphere continuum are well investigated, but their interaction on ecosystem level is not well understood yet. We applied wavelet analysis to a quasi-continuous eddy covariance CH4 flux time series to describe the temporal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange within the growing season of a permanently inundated temperate fen. Moreover, we addressed time scale-specific controls and investigated whether their impact changes during the course of the growing season. On large time scales of two weeks to three months, temperature explained most of the variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange. In general, the temperature in the shallow water column had the largest impact as explanatory variable, however, air temperature and soil temperature became increasingly important as explanatory variables when water level dropped slightly up to June. The diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange shifted during the course of the growing season: During a short time period at the end of April, plant activity (expressed by canopy photosynthesis) caused a diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange with peak time around noon. In the following weeks, the daily cycle of convective mixing within the water column (expressed by the water temperature gradient) gradually gained importance and caused high night-time CH4 emissions, thereby levelling off the diurnal CH4 emission pattern. Moreover, shear-induced turbulence caused short-term fluctuations of ecosystem CH4 exchange on time scales up to two hours. Our study highlights the need for multi-scale approaches that consider the non-stationarity of the underlying processes to adequately describe the complexity of ecosystem CH4 exchange. Moreover, we show that CH4 release processes such as convective mixing of the water column which have been mainly considered for aquatic ecosystems (see recent exceptions in Godwin et al., 2013; Poindexter and Variano, 2013) might also be of importance in shallowly flooded terrestrial ecosystems.

Corrections of stratified tropospheric delays in SAR interferometry: Validation with global atmospheric models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS					Fringe 2007 Workshop	NOV 26-30, 2007	ESA ESRIN, Frascati, ITALY		ESA ESRIN			The main limiting factor on the accuracy of Interferometric SAR measurements (InSAR) comes from phase propagation delays through the troposphere. The delay can be divided into a stratified component, which correlates with the topography and often dominates the tropospheric signal, and a turbulent component. We use Global Atmospheric Models (GAM) to estimate the stratified phase delay and delay-elevation ratio at epochs of SAR acquisitions, and compare them to observed phase delay derived from SAR interferograms. Three test areas are selected with different geographic and climatic environments and with large SAR archive available. The Lake Mead, Nevada, USA is covered by 79 ERS1/2 and ENVISAT acquisitions, the Haiyuan Fault area, Gansu, China, by 24 ERS1/2 acquisitions, and the Afar region, Republic of Djibouti, by 91 Radarsat acquisitions. The hydrostatic and wet stratified delays are computed from GAM as a function of atmospheric pressure P, temperature T, and water vapor partial pressure e vertical profiles. The hydrostatic delay, which depends on ratio P/T varies significantly at low elevation and cannot be neglected. The wet component of the delay depends mostly on the near surface specific humidity. CAM predicted delay-elevation ratios are in good agreement with the ratios derived from InSAR data away from deforming zones. Both estimations of the delay-elevation ratio can thus be used to perform a first order correction of the observed interferometric phase to retrieve a ground motion signal of low amplitude. We also demonstrate that aliasing of daily and seasonal variations in the stratified delay due to uneven sampling of SAR data significantly bias InSAR data stacks or time series produced after temporal smoothing. In all three test cases, the InSAR data stacks or smoothed time series present a residual stratified delay of the order of the expected deformation signal. In all cases, correcting interferograms from the stratified delay removes all these biases. We quantify the standard error associated with the correction of the stratified atmospheric delay. It varies from one site to another depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, but remains bounded by the standard deviation of the daily fluctuations of the stratified delay around the seasonal average. Finally we suggest that the phase delay correction can potentially be improved by introducing a non-linear dependence to the elevation derived from GAM. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Identifying the most reliable predictors of CO2 and CH4 concentrations across different hydrological features can enhance the accuracy of carbon emission estimates locally and globally. Here, we used data from 71 lakes in Southwest China varying in surface area (0.01-702.4 km(2)), mean depth (< 1-89.6 m), and climate to analyze differences in CO2 and CH4 concentrations and their driving mechanisms between the dry and rainy seasons and between different mixing regimes. The results showed that the average concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in the rainy season were 23.9 +/- 18.8 mu mol L-1 and 2.5 +/- 4.9 mu mol L-1, respectively, which were significantly higher than in the dry season (10.5 +/- 10.3 mu mol L-1 and 1.8 +/- 4.2 mu mol L-1, respectively). The average concentrations of CO2 and CH4 at the vertically mixed sites were 24.1 +/- 21.8 mu mol L-1 and 2.6 +/- 5.4 mu mol L-1, being higher than those at the stratified sites (14.8 +/- 13.4 mu mol L-1 and 1.7 +/- 3.5 mu mol L-1, respectively). Moreover, the environmental factors were divided into four categories, i.e., system productivity (represented by the contents of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and dissolved organic matter), physicochemical factors (water temperature, Secchi disk depth, dissolved oxygen and pH value), lake morphology (lake area, water depth and drainage ratio), and geoclimatic factors (altitude, wind speed, precipitation and land-use intensity). In addition to the regression and variance partitioning analyses between the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 and environmental factors, the cascading effects of environmental factors on CO2 and CH4 concentrations were further elucidated under four distinct hydrological scenarios, indicating the different driving mechanisms between the scenarios. Lake morphology and geoclimatic factors were the main direct drivers of the carbon concentrations during the rainy season, while they indirectly affected the carbon concentrations via influencing physicochemical factors and further system productivity during the dry season; although lake morphology and geoclimatic factors directly contributed to the carbon concentrations at the vertically mixed and stratified sites, the direct effect of system productivity was only observed at the stratified sites. Our results emphasize that, when estimating carbon emissions from lakes at broad spatial scales, it is essential to consider the influence of precipitation-related seasons and lake mixing regimes.					; huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; ZHOU, Qichao/KGM-3385-2024; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	ZHOU, Qichao/0000-0002-4292-9817; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR 1	2024	251								121131	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121131		JAN 2024						38246081					WOS:001170643600001

This situation motivates the search for alternate water sources, leading to the indirect water reuse in the Paranoa Lake, an artificial reservoir located in the heart of the Brazilian capital. This work aimed the assessment of 35 micropollutants of emerging concern by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Solid-phase extraction conditions (Oasis HLB) were optimized by a factorial design. Analytes were then assessed in 0.45 mu m filtered samples (1 L) under three different pH by matrix-matched calibration with standard additions and high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring acquisition. Caffeine, bisphenol A and the insect repellant DEET were detected in all investigated samples (n = 14), followed by atrazine (86% of the samples), carbamazepine (71%), paraxanthine (71%), mefenamic acid (64%), nicotine (57%), atenolol (43%) and sulfamethoxazole (43%). Although not frequently detected, the reproductive hormones, estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and estriol, as well as the ovulation inhibitor 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were detected in a sample from the Paranoa Lake WTP in concentrations ranging from 3.71 +/- 0.08 and 5.6 +/- 0.1 ng L-1. Under these levels, risk quotients indicate the potential for adverse effects to both human health and the environment. Copyright (c) 2020, KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.

J	Zhang, GQ; Xie, HJ; Yao, TD; Kang, SC				Zhang GuoQing; Xie HongJie; Yao TanDong; Kang ShiChang			Water balance estimates of ten greatest lakes in China using ICESat and Landsat data	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Lake level and area variations are sensitive to regional climate changes and can be used to indirectly estimate water balances of lakes. In this study, 10 of the largest lakes in China, similar to 1000 km(2) or larger, are examined to determine changes in lake level and area derived respectively from ICESat and Landsat data recorded between 2003 and 2009. The time series of lake level and area of Selin Co, Nam Co, and Qinghai Lake in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Xingkai Lake in northeastern China exhibit an increasing trend, with Selin Co showing the fastest rise in lake level (0.69 m/a), area (32.59 km(2)/a), and volume (1.25 km(3)/a) among the 10 examined lakes. Bosten and Hulun lakes in the arid and semiarid region of northern China show a decline in both lake level and area, with Bosten Lake showing the largest decrease in lake level (-0.43 m/a) and Hulun Lake showing the largest area shrinkage (-35.56 km(2)/a). However, Dongting, Poyang, Taihu, and Hongze lakes in the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin present seasonal variability without any apparent tendencies. The lake level and area show strong correlations for Selin Co, Nam Co, Qinghai, Poyang, Hulun, and Bosten lakes (R (2) > 0.80) and for Taihu, Hongze, and Xingkai lakes (similar to 0.70) and weak correlation for East Dongting Lake (0.37). The lake level changes and water volume changes are in very good agreement for all lakes (R (2) > 0.98). Water balances of the 10 lakes are derived on the basis of both lake level and area changes, with Selin Co, Nam Co, Qinghai, and Xingkai lakes showing positive water budgets of 9.08, 4.07, 2.88, and 1.09 km(3), respectively. Bosten and Hulun lakes show negative budgets of -3.01 and -4.73 km(3), respectively, and the four lakes along the Yangtze River show no obvious variations. Possible explanations for the lake level and area changes in these four lakes are also discussed. This study suggests that satellite remote sensing could serve as a fast and effective tool for estimating lake water balance.

Research on the sources and flux loads of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) has great significance for the control and management of the eutrophication issues facing Lake Taihu. We used hydrologic and water quality surveys of the surrounding rivers, precipitation investigations, and an experimental simulation of suspended sediment to analyze the sources of TN and TP to Lake Taihu and to estimate the flux loads of TN and TP. Our results indicate that (1) surrounding rivers, atmospheric deposition, and sediment suspension were the three main sources of TN and TP, with annual flux loads of 29.6 thousand t and 2.8 thousand t, respectively; (2) for the flux load of TN, influxes from surrounding rivers accounted for 61.1%, while atmospheric deposition contributed 23.5%, with both of these sources varying seasonally. Total nitrogen released from sediments contributed 15.4% of the TN load of Lake Taihu; (3) for TP flux load, surrounding rivers accounted for 42.8% and also showed seasonal variation. Atmospheric deposition and sediment release accounted for 17.9 and 39.3% with no significant seasonal variation. This article quantitatively analyzed the sources and loads of TN and TP and provided a basis for pollution control in Lake Taihu.

Sediment particle-size distribution (PSD) is informative in understanding sediment transport dynamics and biochemical functions. It is, therefore, important to quantitatively characterize the distribution of sediment particles. In the current study, fractal theory is applied to determine the PSD of suspended sediment in the TGR. The results show that the volumetric fractal dimension (D-v) exhibits a significant seasonal difference (p < 0.05), reflecting sediment source and hydrodynamic sorting control the granularity of suspended sediment in the TGR. More specifically, suspended sediment particles are coarser in the wet season than in the dry season for the Yangtze River, and the opposite is true for the Ruxi River, an important tributary. The generalized dimension spectrum, D(q)-q, and multifractal singularity spectrum, f[alpha(q)]-alpha(q), were calculated for each suspended sediment sample. Thereafter, the parameters, D(0), D(1), D(2), alpha(0), Delta alpha(q), and Delta f[alpha(q)], were determined to characterize the PSD. As a result, the coarser suspended sediment during the wet season is characterised by a more complex PSD pattern, with a wider range of particle sizes, greater heterogeneity, and greater homogeneity of distribution over the measurement interval. However, the multifractal structure of the PSD of suspended sediment is more complex during the dry season than during the wet season, with higher local dispersion and variability. The findings of the current study highlight that multifractal analysis provides important insight for understanding the PSD of suspended sediment in the TGR.

Based on combined counts from South Korea, Japan and China, we estimated the total abundance of these species as follows: 42,000-47,000 Whooper Swans Cygnus cygnus; 99,000-141,000 Tundra Swans C. columbianus bewickii; 56,000-98,000 Swan Geese Anser cygnoides; 157,000-194,000 Bean Geese A. fabalis; 231,000-283,000 Greater White-fronted Geese A. albifrons; and 14,000-19,000 Lesser White-fronted Geese A. erythropus. While the count data from Korea and Japan provide a good reflection of numbers present, there remain gaps in the coverage in China, which particularly affect the precision of the estimates for Bean, Greater and Lesser White-fronted Geese as well as Tundra Swans. Lack of subspecies distinction of Bean Geese in China until recently also limits our ability to determine the true status of A. f. middendorffii there, but all indications suggest this population numbers around 18,000 individuals and is in need of urgent attention. The small, highly concentrated and declining numbers of Lesser White-fronted Geese give concern for this species, as do the major declines in Greater White-fronted Geese in China (in contrast to numbers in Japan and Korea, considered to be a separate flyway). In the absence of any demographic data, it is impossible to interpret the causes of these changes in abundance. Improved monitoring, including demographic and tracking studies are required to provide the necessary information to retain populations in favourable conservation status.

Effect of Proposed Large Dams on Water Flows and Hydropower Production in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok Rivers of the Mekong Basin	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Water flow patterns in the Mekong are changing because of on-going rapid hydropower development triggered by economic growth. Of immediate concern are the current and proposed hydropower dams in the transboundary Srepok, Sesan and Srekong (3S) Rivers, which contribute up to 20% of the Mekong's annual flows, have a large potential for energy production and provide critical ecosystem services to the downstream Tonle Sap Lake and Mekong Delta. The objective of this paper is to determine how the operation of the proposed largest individual dams and cascade dam schemes in the 3S Rivers will affect flow regimes and energy production. Daily flows were simulated over 20years using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and HEC-ResSim models for a range of dam development and operations scenarios. The development of all dams in the 3S basin under an operation scheme to maximize individual electricity production results in an average 98% increase in dry season flows at the 3S outlet. Over 55% of dry season flows changes are caused by seven proposed large dams, with the Lower Srepok 3 project causing the highest impact. The seven large dams will generate 33.0GWh/day with a water volume of 17679x10(6)m(3), compared with the current and definite future dams generating 73.2GWh/day with a much lower volume of 6616x10(6)m(3). When a cascade of dams are operational, downstream dams with small reservoirs will produce more energy. However, the marginal increase in energy production from the development of additional dams in the 3S basin will decline rapidly relative to the required water storage increase,. Strategic decision-making on the future of each large proposed dam in the 3S basin needs to be considered by local governments after understanding cumulative operation effects and with further consideration to the potential impact on downstream ecosystem productivity and livelihoods.

However, determining the overall toxicity and environmental risks from MC exposure is complex because of the variety of MC analogues and their respective toxicities. To address this issue, we conducted a survey of particulate (intracellular) and dissolved (extracellular) MC in Lake Taihu from 14 sampling sites in the northern part of the lake, and 32 stations throughout the entire lake, over a 16-month period. We propose a novel indicator, total MC-LR concentration (TLR), defined as the total concentration of MC-LR after transforming other MC variants (i.e., MC-RR and MC-YR) to an equivalent toxicity of MC-LR. Intracellular concentrations of TLR (iTLR) were usually observed, with the maximum values in July and October 2013 corresponding to periods of peaks in phytoplankton biomass. In contrast, extracellular concentrations of TLR (eTLR) were highest in May and June 2014. These differences in temporal patterns exhibited by LR, TLR, and TMC between intracellular and extracellular MC may be attributed to the influence of environmental variables. In addition, the distribution of iTLR and eTLR in the entire lake showed clear spatial heterogeneity. MC concentrations were greatest in the northern part of the lake during warm months, especially in Meiliang Bay. Based on the strong linear relationships between TLR and the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), as well as TLR and the cell density of cyanobacteria, we propose not-to-exceed safety thresholds for Chl-a of 21.28 mu g/L in the northern lake and 23.26 mu g/L in the whole lake, which are paired with safety thresholds for cyanobacterial cell densities of 2.21 x 10(8) cells/L and 1.15 x 10(8) cells/L, respectively. The application of this newly proposed indicator, TLR, may contribute to better evaluation of overall MC toxicity and provide guidance on recommended limits for Chl-a concentration and cyanobacterial cell density in other freshwater ecosystems.

How Uncontrolled Urban Expansion Increases the Contamination of the Titicaca Lake Basin (El Alto, La Paz, Bolivia)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Cities in developing countries encounter rapid waves of social transformation and economic development where the environment is mostly a neglected aspect. The Katari watershed encompasses mining areas, El Alto city (one of the fastest growing urban areas in South America and the biggest in the Altiplano) as well as agricultural areas. Its outlet is Cohana Bay, one of the most polluted areas of Lake Titicaca. Here we propose an integrative approach (hydrological, physicochemical, chemical and bacterial data) to understand the pollution problem of this developing area, in which a variety of anthropogenic activities takes place. Both mining and urban areas appear to be sources of metal pollution. Nutrient and bacterial contaminations are mainly related to urban and industrial discharges. These situations have impacts in the basin from the mining area down to Cohana Bay of Lake Titicaca. Pollutant concentration patterns are highly influenced by seasonal hydrology variations. The poor quality of surface waters in the basin represents a risk for human and animal populations, as well as for the quality of aquifers located underneath El Alto city.

Inadvertent Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Commercial Paint Pigments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) that was not produced as part of the Aroclor mixtures banned in the 1980s was recently reported in air samples collected in Chicago, Philadelphia, the Arctic, and several sites around the Great Lakes. In Chicago, the congener 3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl or PCB11 was found to be the fifth most concentrated congener and ubiquitous throughout the city. The congener exhibited strong seasonal concentration trends that suggest volatilization of this compound from common outdoor surfaces. Due to these findings and also the compound's presence in waters that received waste from paint manufacturing facilities, we hypothesized that PCB11 may be present in current commercial paint In this study we measured PCBs in paint sold on the current retail market We tested 33 commercial paint pigments purchased from three local paint stores. The pigment samples were analyzed for all 209 PCB congeners using gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). More than 50 PCB congeners including several dioxin-like PCBs were detected, and the PCB profiles varied due to different types of pigments and different manufacturing processes. PCB congeners were detected in azo and phthalocyanine pigments which are commonly used in paint but also in inks, textiles, paper, cosmetics, leather, plastics, food and other materials. Our findings suggest several possible mechanisms for the inadvertent production of specific PCB congeners during the manufacturing of paint pigments.

Sariyar, Gokcekaya and Yenice Dams were constructed on the Sararya River for the purpose of electric supply and utility water for agricultural and fishery activities. In this study, sediment samples were collected from 14 stations selected on areas seasonally (2015-2016). Also, cyprinidae species (Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), Capoeta baliki) (Turan, 21 Kottelat, Ekmekci & Imamoglu 2006) were caught from Dam Lakes and Sakarya River. Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb levels in sediment samples and in tissues (liver, gill and muscle) of fish were analyzed in samples by Analytic Jena ContrAA 700 (high-resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometer). The data observed were evaluated with national and international quality criteria. According to the data in the study results, heavy metal accumulations in the gill and liver of fish were determined higher than muscle. Zn levels in muscle of C. gibelio caught from Yenice Dam Lake were higher than the permissible limit stated by Turkish legislation and FAO. Also, Cr and Ni levels in sediment samples especially during rainy seasons were higher to dry seasons and Cr and Ni levels were detected higher than sediment quality guidelines.

Previous investigations carried out in our study area located in Central-Western Santa Cruz province, Patagonia, have stated that climatic fluctuations during the Late Holocene (last 2500 years) were the cause of a reduction of hunter-gatherers' residential mobility. The new climatic conditions were characterized by important environmental droughts, which increased during the Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly, circa 900 years BP. This reduction in mobility resulted in concentrations of populations in low altitude basins and increased logistical and seasonal mobility, defined as a process of extensification. In this paper we take a broad spatial perspective to evaluate to what extent the low residential mobility identified in our research area had a correlation in a larger regional scale. Also we assess if this lead to a regional differentiation among hunter-gatherer populations, previous to European contact (450 years BP). In order to achieve these aims, we undertake a coarse grain analysis, using available data published on the composition and distribution of the archaeological record for Central-Southern Patagonia, an area of about 450.000 km(2). Specifically, we consider evidence about technology, zooarchaeology, rock art, mortuary record and paleodietary studies. The analysis indicates that a reduced residential mobility could have occurred in certain areas of the study region, linked to the aforementioned climatic changes. On the issue of regional differentiation, the archaeological record highlights the complexity of this process. There are a variety of arguments both for and against the idea of a process of regionalization in Central-Southern Patagonia in the Late Holocene. We propose a process of differentiation of populations with low residential mobility which nonetheless remained connected through the circulation of goods, information and people.

However, gaps remain in our understanding of the relationships between the isotopic signatures of leaf waxes and the plants' source water. In this study, we investigated the influence of plant growth form, habitat and season on the distribution patterns and delta H-2(wax) values of 14 plant species (among which are two grasses, five trees and seven shrubs) sampled during four successive dry and wet seasons in three distinct habitats around Lake Chala in equatorial East Africa. Variation in delta H-2(wax) was analyzed with linear mixed-effect models and compared with the associated values of xylem water (delta H-2(xylem)), leaf water (delta H-2(leaf)) and biosynthetic hydrogen fractionation (epsilon(bio)). Our results show that plant growth form was the most important driver of modern-day delta H-2(wax) variability in the study area, and that differences in delta H-2(wax) among habitats to a large extent reflect how each major growth forms is represented in those habitats. Individual plant species appear to express substantial speciesspecific isotopic fractionation that cannot be attributed to the tested external factors but rather seem to depend on intrinsic (e.g., plant phenological and biosynthesis-related) factors. For the purpose of calibrating delta H-2(wax) signatures against vegetation types, it is thus crucial to analyze representative samples of the plant communities present in the study area. Our results further indicate that paleohydrological studies in regions receiving rain from multiple moisture sources must take into account possible seasonal bias in the delta H-2(wax) signature relative to annual rainfall, due to unequal use of those moisture sources by the plants. Finally, the strong influence of plant growth form on delta H-2(wax) values argues for delta H-2(wax) variation in paleo-records being evaluated in conjunction with independent proxy data on changes in vegetation composition. Differences in n-alkane distribution patterns among trees, shrubs and grasses (e.g., average chain length, carbon preference index and C-31/(C-29 + C-31) ratio) may provide such proxies, and can be produced from the same leaf-wax n-alkane dataset used to determine delta H-2(wax) .

The Late Cretaceous dinosaur track record of Bolivia - Review and perspective	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												We present an update and a review of the Late Cretaceous dinosaur tracksites of Bolivia. The Puca Group (Coniacian - Late Maastrichtian) records the tracks and trackways of two different titanosaurid sauropods, ankylosaurs, hadrosaurs and different theropod groups from the Central Andean lacustrine back arc basin. We review the sites from the Maragua syncline (Chuquisaca) and present new data on the famous Toro Toro site (Potosi). Furthermore, the first complete map of the world's largest dinosaur tracksite, Cal Orck'o (El Molino Formation, Sucre) gives an insight into behavior and movement patterns. Parallel trackways of subadult ankylosaurs provide the first unequivocal evidence of social behavior amongst these dinosaurs worldwide. The El Molino Formation and the coeval deposits of Southern Peru and Northern Argentina form a megatracksite with a size of around 100,000 km(2). The paleogeographic position of the main sites within the basin suggests that they are part of a seasonal migration route along the shoreline and deltas of an ancient lake system.					; Meyer, Christian/AAG-2832-2021	Meyer, Christian A./0000-0002-5069-8924; 													0895-9811	1873-0647				MAR	2021	106								102992	10.1016/j.jsames.2020.102992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2020.102992		JAN 2021											WOS:000612683500002

This study aimed to investigate the treatment performance of a large-scale ISFWP system for the improvement of drinking water source. During five years of operation, the average effluent water quality in the ISFWP system could comply with Chinese Environmental Quality Standards for Drinking Water Source. The average removal efficiencies of permanganate index (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus, and fecal coliforms were 7.6%, 44.3%, 42.9%, 50.8%, and 88.6%, respectively. The treatment performance in the ISFWP system was stable during the operation time, while TN removal efficiency declined by 38.2% after five years of operation. Moreover, contaminants removal efficiencies were not subject to change of season, except for CODMn and TN. Consequently, efficient and sustainable contaminants removal in the large-scale ISFWP system still possessed challenges, especially for CODMn and TN.

We hypothesize that the role played by spatial variables is more important in the dry than in the rainy season, because drought increases lakes isolation in semiarid regions. To test our hypothesis, we compared the variation in plankton structure between seasons attributable to local and spatial predictors by using variation-partitioning techniques. We used data for phytoplankton and zooplankton communities as a whole and separately by their size groups (nanoplankton, microplankton and mesoplankton) from 40 man-made lakes in northeastern Brazil. Our results showed that rainfall homogenized limnological variables and reduced total phytoplankton and nanophytoplankton beta diversity, but no effect of season was observed for microphytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Overall, in the dry season, both environmental and spatial variables were important structuring factors for the total phytoplankton, total zooplankton and microzooplankton communities, concurring with both niche- and neutral-based models. In the rainy season, spatial variables were neither important for shaping the phytoplankton nor the zooplankton metacommunities, confirming our hypothesis. The main ecological implication of our findings is that both niche- and neutral-based processes might play an important role on phytoplankton and zooplankton metacommunities dynamics in a future warmer and drier climate in tropical semiarid regions.

Anthropogenic activities in urban areas can strongly affect aquatic biodiversity by modifying aquatic landscape and reduce habitat heterogeneity. As one of the key components in reservoir ecosystems, zooplankton is sensitive to such habitat changes. Within the metacommunity framework, we predict that in an urbanized landscape: (1) species sorting becomes the most important process in determining the variation of zooplankton communities; (2) urbanization will result in low beta-diversity and biotic homogenization of zooplankton communities and such homogenization will not significantly vary across time. To test these predictions, we investigated twenty five permanent reservoirs over three hydrological seasons in a well-developed and rapidly expanding city in tropical China. The reservoirs were grouped into two location classes and three storage size classes. Our results suggested that the structure of zooplankton communities were strongly homogenized in the studied urban reservoirs as being reflected in the low beta-diversity between the two location classes. However, high beta-diversity was found within each storage size class, mainly derived from species turnover (beta(sim)). The high beta-diversity indicated that the variation of zooplankton community is a consequence of environmental heterogeneity within each storage size class. Variation partitioning revealed a weak spatial structure for zooplankton communities at the large scale, while only Chla as an indicator of food supply significantly explained high community variation among reservoirs in the dry season, but not in wet and transition seasons despite apparent species seasonal succession.

Terrestrial input, as attested by a clear seasonality with substantial enrichment during monsoon (2-28 mu g/L and 31-1203 mu g/g; dissolved and particulate PAEs respectively) and post-monsoon (1-7 mu g/L and 7-321 mu g/g; dissolved and particulate PAEs respectively), was identified as the primary source. DnBP (di-n-butyl phthalate) and DEHP (diethylhexyl phthalate) were found to be the dominant species except for dissolved PAEs at pre-monsoon season. Statistical analysis identified two major clusters, in the Sigma(6)PAEs, composed of medium to high molecular weight PAEs (derived from plastic products) and low molecular weight PAEs (derived from cosmetic products). Calculated Risk Quotient (RQ) indicated values indicated moderate to high ecological risk for DnBP and DEHP congeners is a grim pointer to their detrimental effects on human health through consumption of contaminated organisms. Although substantial enrichment of suspended matter gets flushed out of the estuary during monsoon, there is a net PAE accumulation in the estuary during post-monsoon following an increased sedimentary restitution. Data of PAEs generated herein raises a challenge for immediate enactment of statutory legislation to curb and regulate hazardous contamination of estuaries by phthalic acid esters.

Seasonal and Spatial Distribution of Caffeine, Atrazine, Atenolol and DEET in Surface and Drinking Waters from the Brazilian Federal District	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Selected emerging contaminants in water samples from the Brazilian capital were investigated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. In Paranoa Lake, an urban reservoir that will be used to produce chinking water, caffeine was the most abundant contaminant found (average of 53 ng L-1), followed by atenolol (34 ng L-1), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET, 12 ng L-1) and atrazine (3.8 ng L-1). The role of wastewaters discharges could not be evidenced probably due to the water flow and circulation in the lake. However, higher concentrations were detected during the dry season suggesting the presence of point sources, except for atrazine. In source waters, concentrations were lower in comparison with Paranoa Lake waters. Environmental risk assessment shows the need for further surveys for atrazine. For drinking waters, only caffeine and atrazine were detected at average concentrations of 8.6 and 3.2 ng L-1, respectively. No risk for human health was observed.

This study, based on the eddy covariance (EC) measurements data over the Gurbantunggut Desert, analyzed the controlling factors and variations of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco) during the growing season (AprilSeptember2021) in Gurbantunggut Desert. The results were as follows: 1) Carbon fluxes in the Gurbantunggut Desert had prominent daily and seasonal variations during the growing season. On the daily scale, it showed a net uptake during the day and a net release at night, and the monthly average daily change curve of NEE was '' U '' shaped; on the seasonal scale, carbon uptake was observed in all months, with a peak of -37.76 gCm (-2) month (-1) in May. 2)The cumulative amounts of NEE, GPP, and Reco in the Gurbantunggut Desert were -193.74, 235.43, and 41.69 g Cm (-2), respectively, throughout the growing season, showing carbon sinks. 3) Correlation analysis with environmental factors revealed that NEE, GPP, and Reco of desert ecosystems were highly significantly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at different time scales (p < 0.01). Second, at the halfhourly scale, all environmental factors showed vital significance, with a high correlation with air temperature (Tair) and soil temperature (Tsoil); at the monthly scale, they were significantly correlated with Precipitation (p < 0.05). 4) Photosynthetically active radiation is the dominant factor affecting the daily net ecosystem carbon exchange rate. The two are consistent with the rectangle hyperbola model where the daily net ecosystem carbon exchange rate decreases with increasing photosynthetically active radiation. The results indicate that carbon fluxes in the growing season of the Gurbantunggut Desert ecosystem are more sensitive to the response of photosynthetically active radiation. The results have significant reference value for further understanding and research in predicting the source-sink function and influence mechanism of desert ecosystems.

Lake Chenghai is located in the southwestern plateau of China and it is one of only three lakes in the world where Spirulina is found naturally, which has experienced severe decline in water level in recent decades (especially between 2006 and 2016). In addition, in China, there is a lack of hydrological observation data collected for many of the similar plateau inland lakes, which has led to a research gap regarding water-salt balance. This study aimed to investigate the lake watersalt balance, identify the causes for the decline in water volume and the adverse effects of the transition of a freshwater lake to a saline lake. A coupled \water-salt balance mathematical model of the lake was constructed to gain insight into inland water-salt variation in this data scarce region. For Lake Chenghai, there was a 6.43-mdecline in water level with an average rate of decrease of 7.0 cm a(-1) between 1970 and 2016; the multi-year average water shortage was 2945 x 10(4) m(3) a(-1) from 2006 to 2016. The variation in the water level was positively correlated with precipitation (R=0.81, P < 0.0001) and surface runoff inflow (R=0.76, P < 0.0001) during the wet season, and it was negatively correlated with evaporation (R=0.71, P < 0.0001) during the dry season. The warm, dry climate in the dry, hot valley area may be the main reason for the decline in the lake level. Changes in water volume and lake salinity affected the presence and abundance of phytoplankton species and the pH of the aquatic ecosystems. The developed methodology can be used to predict the long-term water and salinity evolution of inland lakes to support sustainable water resource planning in data-scarce regions.

Due to the spatio-temporal variability of PPP applications and of the processes regulating their transport to surface waters, aquatic organisms are typically exposed to pulses of contaminants. In small mountain watersheds, where runoff fluxes are more rapid due to the steep slopes, such exposure peaks are particularly likely to occur. In this work, a spatially explicit, dynamic model for predicting pesticide exposure in surface waters of cultivated mountain basins (DynAPlus) has been developed. The model has been applied to a small mountain watershed (133 km(2)) located in the Italian Eastern Alps and characterized by intensive agriculture (apple orchards) around the main river and its tributaries. DynAPlus performance was evaluated for chlorpyrifos through experimental monitoring, using samples collected during the 2011 and 2012 productive seasons. The comparison between predictions and measurements resulted in a good agreement (R-2 = 0.49, efficiency factor 0.60), although a more accurate spatial information in the input scenario (e.g., field-specific applications, rainfall amount, soil properties) would dramatically improve model performance. A set of illustrative simulations performed for three PPPs highlighted the potential role of DynAPlus in improving exposure predictions for ecological risk assessment and pesticide management practices (e.g., for active ingredient and application rate selection), as well as for planning efficient monitoring campaigns and/or interpreting monitoring data. However, some model improvements (e.g., solid erosion and transport) and a more thorough model validation are desirable to enlarge the applicability domain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The campaign was focused on inland waters, with sampling of four lakes and a coastal lagoon during the growth season, in addition to samples of opportunity from other four lakes. Campaigns also included the Scheldt estuary over a tidal cycle and two sampling campaigns in the Belgian coastal zone. Measured parameters include inherent optical properties (absorption, scattering and beam attenuation coefficients, near-forward volume scattering function, turbidity), apparent optical properties (Secchi disc depth, substrate and water-leaving Lambert-equivalent bi-hemispherical reflectance), and biogeochemical properties (suspended particulate matter, mineral fraction of particle mass, particle size distribution, pigment concentration, DNA metabarcoding, flow microscopy counts, and bottom type classification). The diversity of water bodies and environmental conditions covered a wide range of system states. The chlorophyll a concentration varied from 0.63 to 382.72 mgm(-3), while the suspended particulate matter concentration varied from 1.02 to 791.19 gm(-3), with mineral fraction varying from 0 to 0.95. Depending on system and season, phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by cyanobacteria, green algae (Mamiellophyceae, Pyramimonadophyceae), or diatoms.

Here, we used a culture-independent approach to characterize bacterial assemblages during rain events with and without Saharan dust influence arriving to a high mountain lake in the Austrian Alps. Bacterial assemblage composition differed significantly between samples with and without Saharan dust influence. Although alpha diversity indices were within the same range in both sample categories, rain events with Atlantic or continental origins were dominated by Betaproteobacteria, whereas those with Saharan dust intrusions were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria. The high diversity and evenness observed in all samples suggests that different sources of bacteria contributed to the airborne assemblage collected at the lake shore. During experiments with bacterial assemblages collected during rain events with Saharan dust influence, cell numbers rapidly increased in sterile lake water from initially approximate to 3x10(3) cellml(-1) to 3.6-11.1x10(5) cellsml(-1) within 4-5 days, and initially, rare taxa dominated at the end of the experiment. Our study documents the dispersal of viable bacteria associated to Saharan dust intrusions travelling northwards as far as 47 degrees latitude.					; Hörtnagl, Paul/G-5806-2010; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011; Sommaruga, Ruben/P-6626-2019; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014	Peter, Hannes/0000-0001-9021-3082; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724													1758-2229					DEC	2014	6	6					618	624		10.1111/1758-2229.12175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12175								25756115					WOS:000345702700010

S.; Zuchi, Nagila; Zuanon, Jansen; Amadio, Sidineia			Effects of climate-driven hydrological changes in the reproduction of Amazonian floodplain fishes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Abnormal hydroclimatic years in the Amazon have been increasingly frequent in the last two decades, creating more prolonged droughts and severe floods. These events are expected to impact organismal phenology, including seasonal reproduction of fish. Droughts are also expected to increase fish mortality and vulnerability to fishing. However, empirical evidence on the impact of these novel conditions on fish reproduction and demography is still limited. Here, we evaluate how changes in hydrological conditions and fishing affected reproduction and demographic parameters for the 16 most common floodplain fish species in the central Amazon. We used water level data collected for 113 years together with a 19-year dataset of fish biology, sampled monthly from a floodplain lake at the confluence of Amazon and Negro rivers. We observed a lower proportion of ripe females after long, drier low-water and abrupt rising-water seasons. For many species, we detected a progressive reduction in the female's size at sexual maturity, the average size of the ripe females and in the abundance of larger adult females. These effects were observed for both fished and non-fished species, suggesting that the effect of the recent hydroclimatic events might be affecting most fish species. However, fished species showed a steeper decline in the average body size of ripe females, suggesting that size reduction is a combined effect of drought severity and fishing pressure. Policy implications. Our results for the proportion of females in reproduction mediated by hydrological conditions and temporal changes of demographic and life-history parameters suggest that drought events can reduce the resilience of fish populations in the central Amazon. The increasing frequency of droughts and rapid changes in fish reproductive parameters highlight the need for conservation policies to consider the impact of droughts in addition to fisheries and habitat degradation. Our results should be taken as an early warning regarding the conservation and sustainable use of Amazon aquatic biodiversity. Conserving fish diversity and fish stocks will require substantial ecosystem management in a large portion of the Amazon floodplains and a greater enforcement of fisheries management regulations in years of predicted drought.

Although these spatial trends have been well documented, the underlying hydroclimatic mechanisms are not well understood. Since 2013, we have carried out comprehensive water budget observations at Paiku Co, an alpine lake in the central Himalayas. In this study, we investigate water storage and lake level changes on seasonal to decadal time scales based on extensive in-situ measurements and satellite observations. Bathymetric surveys show that Paiku Co has a mean and maximum water depth of 41.1 m and 72.8 m, respectively, and its water storage was estimated to be 109.3 x 10(8) m(3) in June 2016. On seasonal scale between 2013 and 2017, Paiku Co's lake level decreased slowly between January and May, increased considerably between June and September, and then decreased rapidly between October and January. On decadal time scale, Paiku Co's lake level decreased by 3.7 +/- 0.3 m and water storage reduced by (10.2 +/- 0.8) x 10(8) m(3) between 1972 and 2015, accounting for 8.5% of the total water storage in 1972. This change is consistent with a trend towards drier conditions in the Himalaya region during the recent decades. In contrast, glacial lakes within Paiku Co's basin expanded rapidly, indicating that, unlike Paiku Co, glacial meltwater was sufficient to compensate the effect of the reduced precipitation.

Early pastoral mobility and seasonality in Kenya assessed through stable isotope analysis	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Eastern African pastoralists today depend on mobility to access seasonally available pastures for their livestock. Here, we evaluate the importance of mobility strategies for maintaining herds during the Pastoral Neolithic era in southern Kenya through stable isotope analysis. We use carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of sequentially sampled modern and archaeological cattle, sheep, and goat tooth enamel to reconstruct seasonal vertical mobility strategies of early pastoralists in the region from 3000 to 1200 years ago. An altitudinal transition from C-4 grasses at low elevations to C-3 grasses at higher elevations permits tracking vertical mobility in the Kenya Rift Valley. Results from eight Pastoral Neolithic sites from southern Kenya show that cattle, sheep, and goats were almost exclusively herded at low elevations throughout the year. Higher variability in carbon isotopes of caprines compared to cattle suggests that caprines had greater seasonal dietary flexibility. Oxygen isotopes were not consistently useful for identifying seasonal patterns: intra- and interannual variability in tropical precipitation and plant water isotopic composition are confounding factors. Archaeological contexts representing local foragers that adopted pastoralism show herding strategies similar to those from established pastoral sites. These results suggest that lower elevation savannas were productive enough to support pastoralism year-round during the Pastoral Neolithic era.

In the troposphere, O3 is produced in complex cycles of photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Determining if O3 levels will be decreased by lowering NOx emissions ("NOx-sensitive"), VOC emissions ("VOC-sensitive"), or both ("the transition zone") can be done by using the formaldehyde (HCHO; a VOC species) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2; a component of NOx) concentration ratio (HCHO/NO2; "FNR"). Generally, lower FNR values indicate VOC sensitivity, while higher values indicate NOx sensitivity. Despite being a highly populated region with coastal O3 air quality issues, the Lake Michigan region in the United States, including the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area (CMA), remains relatively understudied, especially from the satellite perspective. In this work, we present the first study that utilizes TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite data over the Lake Michigan region from 2019-2021 to assess changes in O-3 precursor levels and the inferred O-3 chemistry sensitivity between (1) O-3 season days and CMA O-3 exceedance days and (2) weekdays and weekends. Higher NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs), HCHO VCDs, and FNR values are seen throughout the study domain on exceedance days, indicating generally more NOx-sensitive O-3 chemistry. The largest change occurs in the areal extent of the transition zone, which decreases by 40 % during exceedance days. Major urban cores in the domain (e.g., Chicago, Illinois; Gary, Indiana; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin) remain VOC-sensitive on exceedance days as the higher NO2 VCDs in these areas counterbalance the regionally higher HCHO VCDs. Utilizing 10 m wind analysis data, we show that the lake breeze circulation is stronger on exceedance days. The strengthening of the lake breeze causes stronger convergence of the wind field along the southwestern Lake Michigan coastline, which can concentrate NO2 emissions originating in this area. This finding provides a possible explanation for the higher TROPOMI NO2 VCDs over the urban core of Chicago on exceedance days. Investigation of 2 m air temperature analysis data reveals that temperatures are higher on exceedance days, which explains the stronger lake breeze circulation and provides a possible cause for the higher TROPOMI HCHO VCDs over the entire region (due to increased temperature-dependent biogenic VOC emissions). Comparing weekdays and weekends, higher FNR values throughout much of the region indicate increasingly NOx-sensitive O3 chemistry on weekends. These changes are driven by lower NO2 VCDs in urban areas, particularly in Chicago, and higher HCHO VCDs in the southern part of the domain on weekends. Overall, our analyses suggest that VOC emissions controls in major urban areas and NOx emissions controls throughout the entire domain are necessary to decrease O-3 levels in the Lake Michigan region.					; Pierce, R./A-5990-2019; Acdan, Juanito Jerrold/HZL-8569-2023	Acdan, Jerrold/0000-0003-4192-4333; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				JUL 17	2023	23	14					7867	7885		10.5194/acp-23-7867-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7867-2023													WOS:001031038500001
J	Xu, KH; Milliman, JD				Xu, Kehui; Milliman, John D.			Seasonal variations of sediment discharge from the Yangtze River before and after impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Over the past decades, >50,000 dams and reforestation on the Yangtze River (Changjiang) have had little impact on water discharge but have drastically altered annual and particularly seasonal sediment discharge. Before impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in June 2003, annual sediment discharge had decreased by 60%, and the hysteresis of seasonal rating curves in the upper reaches at Yichang station had shifted from clockwise to counterclockwise. In addition, the river channel in middle-lower reaches had changed from depositional to erosional in 2002. During the four years (2003-2006) after TGD impoundment, similar to 60% of sediment entering the Three Gorges Reservoir was trapped, primarily during the high-discharge months (June-September). Although periodic sediment deposition continues downstream of the TGD, during most months substantial erosion has occurred, supplying similar to 70 million tons per year (Mt/y) of channel-derived sediment to the lower reaches of the river. If sand extraction (similar to 40 Mt/y) is taken into consideration, the river channel loses a total of 110 Mt/y. During the extreme drought year 2006, sediment discharge in the upper reaches drastically decreased to 9 Mt (only 2% of its 1950-1960s level) because of decreased water discharge and TGD trapping. In addition, Dongting Lake in the middle reaches, for the first time, changed from trapping net sediment from the mainstem to supplying 14 Mt net sediment to the mainstem. Severe channel erosion and drastic sediment decline have put considerable pressure on the Yangtze coastal areas and East China Sea. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of SMAP/Sentinel 1 High-Resolution Soil Moisture Data to Detect Irrigation Over Agricultural Domain	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Irrigation is not well represented in land surface, hydrological, and climate models. One way to account for irrigation is by assimilating satellite soil moisture data that contains irrigation signal with land surface models. In this study, the irrigation detection ability of SMAP enhanced 9 km and SMAP-Sentinel 1 (SMAP-S1), 3 km and 1 km soil moisture products are evaluated using the first moment (mean) and the second moment (variability) of soil moisture data. The SMAP enhanced 9 km soil moisture product lacks irrigation signals in an irrigated plain south of Urmia Lake, whereas SMAP-S1 products record irrigation signal in soil moisture variability. Despite observing higher variability over irrigated areas, there are only small and inconsistent wet biases observed over irrigated pixels relative to nearby nonirrigated pixels during the irrigation season. This is partly attributable to the climatology vegetation water content used in the SMAP-S1 soil moisture retrieval algorithm that is not accounting for crop rotation and land management. Thus, in the second part of this study, we updated the retrieval algorithm to use dynamic vegetation water content. The update increased vegetation water content up to 1 kg/m(2) which corresponds with a 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3) increase in soil moisture during irrigation season. The update does not notably change soil moisture retrievals off season. This study shows that irrigation signals are present in both the first and second moment of soil moisture time series, and employing dynamic vegetation water content in the SMAP-S1 algorithm can enhance the irrigation signal over agricultural regions.					; Jalilvand, Ehsan/AAF-1453-2019; Das, Narendra/MZQ-9902-2025; Tajrishy, Massoud/ABE-6204-2020; Abolafia-Rosenzweig, Ronnie/ITU-2502-2023	Abolafia-Rosenzweig, Ronnie/0000-0002-6169-6430; Tajrishy, Massoud/0000-0001-9252-8213; Das, Narendra/0000-0003-1634-3879; Jalilvand, ehsan/0000-0003-4704-9920; 													1939-1404	2151-1535					2021	14						10733	10747		10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3119228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3119228													WOS:000714204000011

However, there remains a knowledge gap in how TSI links to the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) generated and consumed in lakes. Here we explored the temporal variations of lake pCO(2) and TSI, as well as their linkages in a karst plateau lake. Lake pCO(2) ranged from 90.1 to 7169.3 mu atm and was significantly high in the post-wet period (2534.3 +/- 1637.9 mu atm). Over 58% of samples were found to be supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium (410 mu atm). Biological and hydrological processes regulated lake trophic status, resulting in mesotrophic state (30 < TSI 50) in the post-wet period and eutrophic state (TSI 50) in the drought and initial-wet periods. Coupled carbonate dissolution and photosynthesis consumed the pCO(2), whereas groundwater and respiration contributed the pCO(2) in the karst lake. Our results highlighted that lake TSI could decipher trophic status and further partially explain the pCO(2) dynamics and sources.					; Li, Siyue/E-8297-2012; liang, YU/IYT-4334-2023	maofei, ni/0000-0002-4905-2739; Li, Siyue/0000-0002-3097-6819; liang, YU/0009-0007-3922-3454													1470-160X	1872-7034				JAN	2021	120								106912	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106912													WOS:000591907400006

The accelerated industrial development would inevitably cause environmental consequences in par-ticipants, in which pollution and related health risks caused by industrial heavy metal emissions were among the most concerned. In this study, an improved grey water footprint of industrial heavy metal emissions (GWFHMs) was proposed from the perspective of health risks to address the limitation of conventional GWF in reflecting their properties and impacts of pollutants, such as the health toxicity of heavy metals. Meanwhile, the water pollution level of GWFHMs (WPLHMs) was estimated to reveal the degree of aquatic industrial heavy metal pollution concerning health risks. We use China, the B&RI member with severe heavy metal pollution, as a case. The spatial distribution of GWFHMs (at the resolution of 1 km x 1 km) and WPLHMs (at the watershed level) monthly during 1998-2015 were uncovered. Results show that the GWFHMs of China have significantly decreased in this period, but WPLHMs in some regions are still high due to cyclical fluctuations in heavy metal emissions and water runoffs. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River had the highest GWFHMs but relatively low WPLHMs due to abundant water runoffs. In contrast, the Liaohe watersheds in north China had the highest WPLHMs due to water shortage, especially in dry seasons (from December to February). This study reveals critical periods and hotspot regions for heavy metal pollution, which would support decision-making for delicacy industrial heavy metal control measures concerning human health in B&RI countries. In addition to direct emission control, production activities and the following industrial wastewater emissions should also consider the time variation of water runoffs in each region, which would contribute to keeping the health risks of industrial heavy metal emissions within acceptable limits.

Lake Erie field trials to advance autonomous monitoring of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Biomolecular analyses are used to investigate the dynamics of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs), with samples collected during monitoring often analyzed by qPCR and sometimes amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. However, cyanoHAB research and monitoring programs face operational constraints due to the reliance on human resources for sample collections. To address this impediment, a third-generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G ESP) integrated with a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) was tested during seasonal blooms of Microcystis in western Lake Erie (WLE) in 2018 and 2019. The LRAUV-3G ESP successfully performed flexible, autonomous sampling across a wide range of cyanoHAB conditions, and results indicated equivalency between autonomous and manual methods. No significant differences were found between LRAUV-3G ESP and manual sample collection and handling methods in the 12 parameters tested. Analyzed parameters included concentrations of total cyanobacteria and microcystin toxin gene via qPCR; relative abundances of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; and community diversity measures from both 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. The LRAUV-3G ESP provided additional sampling capacity and revealed differences between field seasons for bacterial taxa and concentrations of total cyanobacteria and microcystin toxin gene. Metagenomic analysis of multiple microcystin toxin genes corroborated the use of the mcyE gene as a proxy for the genomic potential of WLE cyanoHABs to produce microcystin. Overall, this study provides support for the use of autonomous 'omics capability in WLE to help expand the spatial and temporal coverage of cyanoHAB monitoring operations.

Spatial and Temporal Variability of Nutrient Dynamics and Ecosystem Metabolism in a Hyper-eutrophic Reservoir Differ Between a Wet and Dry Year	ECOSYSTEMS												Climate change alters hydrologic regimes, including their variability. Effects will be pronounced in aquatic ecosystems, where resource subsidies (e.g., nutrients, carbon) drive key ecosystem processes. However, we know little about how changing hydrologic regimes will modulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of lake biogeochemistry and ecosystem metabolism. To address this, we quantified ecosystem metabolism and nutrient dynamicsat high spatial resolution in Acton Lake, a hyper-eutrophic reservoir in the Midwestern US. We captured two consecutive growing seasons with markedly different watershed discharge and nutrient loading. Temporal variability often exceeded spatial variability in both wet and dry years. However, relative spatial variability was higher in the dry year, suggesting that internal processes are more important in structuring spatial dynamics in dry years. Strikingly, marked differences in watershed discharge and nutrient loading between years produced relatively small differences in many lake metrics, suggesting resilience to hydrologic variability. We found little difference in gross primary productivity between wet and dry years, but ecosystem respiration was higher in the wet year, shifting net ecosystem production below zero. Discrete storm events produced strong, yet ephemeral and spatially explicit effects, reflective of the balance of stream input and discharge over the dam. Increases in limiting nutrients were restricted to near stream inlets and returned to pre-storm baseline within days. Ecosystem metabolism was suppressed during storm events, likely due to biomass flushing. Understanding how changing hydrologic regimes will mediate spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem metrics is paramount to preserving the ecological integrity and ecosystem services of lakes under future climates.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				JAN	2021	24	1					68	88		10.1007/s10021-020-00505-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00505-8		APR 2020											WOS:000529126100001
J	Ta, AT; Babel, S				Ta, Anh Tuan; Babel, Sandhya			Microplastics and heavy metals in a tropical river: Understanding spatial and seasonal trends and developing response strategies using DPSIR framework	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microplastics (MPs) have become an increasingly popular topic in recent years due to the growing concern about their impact on human health and the environment. Rivers in Southeast Asia are the dominant source of plastics and MPs into the environment; however, research on MPs in rivers from the region is insufficient. This study aims to investigate the impacts of spatial and seasonal variations on the distribution of MPs with heavy metals in one of the top 15 rivers releasing plastics into oceans (Chao Phraya, Thailand). Findings from this study are analyzed using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework for proposing strategies to minimize plastic and MPs in this trop-ical river. Spatially, most MPs were detected in the urban zone, while the lowest was in the agricultural zone. Also, MP levels in the dry season are higher than at the end but lower than at the beginning of the rainy season. MPs with frag-ment morphology were mainly found in the river (70-78 %). Polypropylene was found with the highest percentage (54-59 %). MPs in the river were mostly detected in the size range of 0.05-0.3 mm (36-60 %). Heavy metals were also found in all MPs collected from the river. Higher metal concentrations were detected in the agricultural and estu-ary zones in the rainy season. Potential responses, including regulatory and policy instruments, environmental educa-tion, and environmental cleanups, were drawn from the DPSIR framework.

Freshwater fisheries exemplify this problem, with many populations supported by multiple stocks of young evolutionary age and isolated across small spatial scales. Consequently, attempts to conduct genetic mixed-stock analyses of inland fisheries have often been unsuccessful. Advances in genomic sequencing offer the ability to discriminate among populations with weak population structure, providing the necessary resolution to conduct mixed-stock assignment among previously indistinguishable stocks. We used genomic data to conduct a mixed-stock analysis of eastern Lake Erie's commercial and recreational walleye (Sander vitreus) fisheries and estimate the relative harvest of weakly differentiated stocks (pairwise F-ST < 0.01). Using RAD-capture (Rapture), we sequenced and genotyped individuals from western and eastern basin local spawning stocks at 12,081 loci with 95% reassignment accuracy, which was not possible in the past using microsatellite markers. A baseline assessment of 395 walleye from 11 spawning stocks identified three reporting groups and refined previous assessments of gene flow among walleye stocks. Genetic assignment of 1,075 walleye harvested in eastern Lake Erie's recreational and commercial fisheries indicated that western basin stocks constituted the majority of harvest during the peak walleye fishing season (July-September), whereas eastern basin individuals comprised much of the early season harvest (May-June). Clear spatial structure in harvest composition existed; catches in more easterly sites contained more individuals of eastern basin origin than did more westerly sites. Our study provides important stock contribution estimates for Lake Erie fishery management and demonstrates the utility of genomic data to facilitate mixed-stock analysis in exploited fish populations having weak population structure or limited existing genetic resources.

Paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic evolution and cyclo- and chrono-stratigraphy of upper Permian-Lower Triassic fluvial-lacustrine deposits in Bogda Mountains, NW China - Implications for diachronous plant evolution across the Permian-Triassic boundary	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Stratigraphic sections in the Bogda Mountains, NW China, provide detailed records of late Permian-Early Triassic terrestrial paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic evolution at the paleo-mid-latitude of NE Pangea. The sections are located in the Tarlong-Taodonggou, Dalongkou, and Zhaobishan areas,-100 km apart, and-5000 m in total thickness. An age model was constructed using seven high-resolution U-Pb zircon CA-TIMS dates in the Tarlong-Taodonggou sections and projected to sections in two other areas to convert the litho-and cyclo-stratigraphy into a chronostratigraphy. Sediments were deposited in braided and meandering streams, and lacustrine deltaic and lakeplain-littoral environments. A cyclostratigraphy was established on the basis of repetitive environmental changes for high-order cycles, stacking patterns of high-order cycles, and long-term climatic and tectonic trends for low-order cycles (LC). Sedimentary evidence from the upper Wuchiapingian-mid Induan Wutonggou LC indicates that the climate was generally humid-subhumid and gradually became variable toward a seasonally dry condition in the early Induan. Lush vegetation had persisted across the Permo-Triassic boundary into the early Induan. A subhumid-semiarid condition prevailed during the deposition of mid Induan-lower Olenekian Jiu-caiyuan and lower Olenekian Shaofanggou LCs. These three LCs are largely continuous and separated by con-formities and diastems. Intra-and inter-graben stratigraphic variability is reflected by variations in thickness, depositional system, and average sedimentation rate, and results in variable spatial and temporal stratigraphic resolution. Such stratigraphic variability is mainly controlled by paleogeographic location, depocenter shift, and episodic uplift and subsidence in the source areas and catchment basin. A changeover of plant communities occurred during the early Induan, postdating the end-Permian marine mass extinction. However, riparian vegetation and upland forests were still present from the mid Induan to early Olenekian, and served as primary food source for terrestrial ecosystems, including vertebrates. Correlation of the vascular plant evolutionary history from the latest Changhsingian to early Induan in the Bogda Mountains with those reported from Australia and south China indicates a diachronous floral changeover on Pangea. The late Permian-Early Triassic litho-, cyclo-and chrono-stratigraphies, constrained by the age model, provides a foundation for future studies on the evolution of continental sedimentary, climatic, biologic, and ecological systems in the Bogda region. It also provides a means to correlate terrestrial events in the mid-paleolatitudes with marine and nonmarine records in the other parts of the world.					; Wan, Mingli/I-2311-2016; Luo, Xiaorong/MEO-1893-2025	Roopnarine, Peter/0000-0002-9811-1176; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				NOV	2021	222								103741	10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103741		OCT 2021											WOS:000710182000002

With increasing economic and agricultural activities, the negative impacts of human activities on water quality particularly on karst wetland is also increasing. In this paper multiple datasets and methods including hydrological, hydrochemical and stable isotope data were used to elucidate the distribution and transport of nitrate pollution in Huixian karst wetland under the influence of seasonal hydrodynamic changes and human activities. Hydrodynamic conditions around the wetland during both we and dry seasons show large differences due to the complex exchange between surface water and groundwater. The northern recharge area receives rainfall recharge with rapid responses in groundwater level, temperature and electrical conductivity, while those responses are relatively stable in the central area where the surface water interacts with groundwater frequently. However, their diurnal variations are significant. In the western drainage area where groundwater always discharges to rivers, the groundwater levels show sharp responses after rainfall, but their temperatures are stable. In addition, delta N-15 and delta O-18 of nitrate suggest that the nitrate pollution mainly comes from NH4+ in fertilizer and rainfall, soil nitrogen, animal feces and livestock manure. The nitrate concentrations of most surface waters are lower during the we season, affected by the dilution and mixing effect of heavy rainfall and agricultural activities. Nitrate distributions show considerable spatial variability during the dry season, especially in the wells located in residential areas which are mainly polluted by nearby residents. This study highlights the vulnerability of karst wetlands and presents methods that are significant for ecological restoration as well as development of karst water resources in karst areas.					gan, yiqun/NPI-6826-2025; Luo, Mingming/I-3492-2018	Luo, Mingming/0000-0002-5192-6466													0169-7722	1873-6009				OCT	2020	234								103700	10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103700								32861126					WOS:000576786400004

Ecological Patterns Among Bacteria and Microbial Eukaryotes Derived from Network Analyses in a Low-Salinity Lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Microbial communities are comprised of complex assemblages of highly interactive taxa. We employed network analyses to identify and describe microbial interactions and co-occurrence patterns between microbial eukaryotes and bacteria at two locations within a low salinity (0.5-3.5 ppt) lake over an annual cycle. We previously documented that the microbial diversity and community composition within Lake Texoma, southwest USA, were significantly affected by both seasonal forces and a site-specific bloom of the harmful alga, Prymnesium parvum. We used network analyses to answer ecological questions involving both the bacterial and microbial eukaryotic datasets and to infer ecological relationships within the microbial communities. Patterns of connectivity at both locations reflected the seasonality of the lake including a large rain disturbance in May, while a comparison of the communities between locations revealed a localized response to the algal bloom. A network built from shared nodes (microbial operational taxonomic units and environmental variables) and correlations identified conserved associations at both locations within the lake. Using network analyses, we were able to detect disturbance events, characterize the ecological extent of a harmful algal bloom, and infer ecological relationships not apparent from diversity statistics alone.					; Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012	Hambright, K.

Retrieval of Simultaneous Water-Level Changes in Small Lakes With InSAR	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Monitoring water level changes is necessary to manage, conserve and restore natural, and anthropogenic lake systems. However, the in-situ monitoring of lake systems is unfeasible due to limitations of costs and access. Furthermore, current remote sensing methods are restricted to large lakes and low spatial resolutions. We develop a novel approach using subsequential pixel-wise observations of the Sentinel-1B sensor based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar to detect water level changes in small lakes. We used 24 small ungauged lakes of the Cajas Massif lake system in Ecuador for development and validation. We found Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR)-derived water level changes across lakes to be consistent with precipitation, capturing the peak of the wet seasons.

Although with limitations, this study shows the underutilized potential of DInSAR to understand water level changes in small lakes with current radar data availability.

J	Cluett, AA; Thomas, EK				Cluett, A. A.; Thomas, E. K.			Resolving combined influences of inflow and evaporation on western Greenland lake water isotopes to inform paleoclimate inferences	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Stable isotopes of oxygen (delta O-18) and hydrogen (delta H-2) in precipitation are widely employed tracers of the global hydrologic cycle, and are frequently inferred from lake-water-derived proxies in sediments of high-latitude lakes. Lake-water isotope proxies archive precipitation delta O-18 and delta H-2 values, modulated by lake hydrological processes, which may be functionally classified into processes that affect source water isotope values (i.e. inflow delta O-18 and delta H-2) and catchment-integrated evaporation. Respectively, these controls form the basis of interpretations of precipitation isotope and effective precipitation signals from lake-water isotope proxy records. Conventionally, a single control on lake water isotope variability is assumed for a given record. Yet sensitivity to these controls depends on regional hydroclimate and local hydrology, which may change through time. We quantified the relative impacts of variations in inflow delta O-18 and evaporative O-18 enrichment on lake water delta O-18 in response to spatially variable aridity, using measurements of lake water delta H-2 and delta O-18 from 140 western Greenland lakes located between the Labrador Sea and western Greenland Ice Sheet margin. We calculated source water delta O-18 of lake waters (delta I) using a recently developed Bayesian method and quantified evaporation-to-inflow ratios (E/I) using a modified Craig-Gordon model. delta I varied by 11.1 parts per thousand across the study region, superimposed by evaporative O-18 enrichment of up to 20.0 parts per thousand and E/I ranging from nearly no evaporative loss (E/I < 0.10) to desiccation (E/I > 1). Lakes can be broadly classified as predominantly sensitive to inflow or evaporation, corresponding to their location along the aridity gradient, and there are significant trends in both delta I and E/I across the study area. Substantial local variability in delta I and E/I suggests catchment hydrology determines the sensitivity of delta I and E/I to changes in aridity, and implies that hydrological end-member lakes within a small region may provide complementary records of seasonal precipitation isotope values and ice-free-season evaporation. Deconvolving modern controls on lake water isotope values provides essential support for quantitative and seasonal paleoclimate inferences from paleolimnological isotope data, which will improve constraints on the long-term variability of the Arctic hydrologic cycle.

A unique Chinese eutrophic lake - Dianchi - was selected for study because it has two separate and distinct basins, Caohai with higher organic carbon levels and Waihai with lower organic carbon levels. Sediment bacterial communities were studied in the two basins using samples collected in each season from June 2010 to March 2011. Barcoded pyrosequencing based on the 16 S rRNA gene found that certain common phyla, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi, were dominant in the sediments from both basins. However, from the class to genus level, the dominant bacterial groups found in the sediments were distinct between the two basins. Correlation analysis revealed that, among the environmental parameters examined, total organic carbon (TOC) accounted for the greatest proportion of variability in bacterial community. Interestingly, study results suggest that increasing allochthonous organic carbon could enhance bacterial diversity and biomass in the sediment. In addition, analysis of function genes (amoA and nosZ) demonstrated that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were dominant in sediments, with 99% belonging to Nitrosomonas. Denitrifying bacteria were comparatively diverse and were associated with some cultivatable bacteria.

A decade (2002-2012) of supraglacial lake volume estimates across Russell Glacier, West Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Supraglacial lakes represent an ephemeral storage buffer for meltwater runoff and lead to significant, yet short-lived, episodes of ice-flow acceleration by decanting large meltwater and energy fluxes into the ice sheet's hydrological system. Here, a methodology for calculating lake volume is used to quantify storage and drainage across Russell Glacier, West Greenland, between 2002 and 2012. Using 502 MODIS scenes, water volume at similar to 200 seasonally occurring lakes was derived using a depth-reflectance relationship, which was independently calibrated and field validated against lake bathymetry. The inland expansion of lakes is strongly correlated with air temperature: during the record melt years of 2010 and 2012, lakes formed and drained earlier, attaining their maximum volume 38 and 20 days earlier than the 11 yr mean, as well as occupying a greater area and forming at higher elevations (> 1800m) than previously. Despite occupying under 2% of the study area, lakes delay the transmission of up to 7-13% of the bulk meltwater discharged. Although the results are subject to an observational bias caused by periods of cloud cover, we estimate that across Russell Glacier, 28% of supraglacial lakes drain rapidly (< 4 days). Clustering of such events in space and time suggests a synoptic trigger mechanism. Further, we find no evidence to support a unifying critical size or depth-dependent drainage threshold.					; Hubbard, Alun/R-5085-2017; Box, Jason/AAE-1654-2019	Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258; Box, Jason/0000-0003-0052-8705; Hubbard, Alun/0000-0002-0503-3915; van As, Dirk/0000-0002-6553-8982; Quincey, Duncan/0000-0002-7602-7926; Doyle, Samuel/0000-0002-0853-431X; Jones, Glenn/0000-0002-7691-332X													1994-0416	1994-0424					2014	8	1					107	121		10.5194/tc-8-107-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-8-107-2014													WOS:000332317000008

Study focus: Microplastics (MPs) have been identified as emerging contaminants, potentially impacting public and ecosystem health. This comprehensive review discusses the current state of knowledge on MP contamination and mechanistic process understanding in Indian inland aquatic ecosystems. It highlights knowledge gaps regarding current MP data and discusses methodological differences in MP sampling and sample processing that can lead to contrasting results. New hydrological insight for the region: Most studies reviewed here have provided evidence of MP contamination in water, sediment and certain indicator species of inland aquatic ecosystems at specific locations and times. Significant seasonal variations in MP concentrations have been identified for pre-, during and post-monsoon periods. We found that only a few of the reviewed studies have considered the inherent spatio-temporal variability of MP concentrations, and the intricate interplay with hydrological key parameters has largely been overlooked. However, in order to improve our understanding of how MPs are transported within these aquatic ecosystems (e.g., river networks) and decide on potential pollution mitigation, it is imperative to link data on MP concentration and physico-chemical characteristics with key hydrological information such as flow velocity or discharge. This will provide information on MP loads and help to establish loading functions for these aquatic ecosystems that are needed to better understand the impacts of MP pollution on public and ecosystem health.					; Krause, Stefan/C-4351-2008; Schneidewind, Uwe/D-9640-2015; Yadav, Brijesh/NLN-5649-2025	Krause, Stefan/0000-0003-2521-2248; Schneidewind, Uwe/0000-0002-4523-7429; 														2214-5818				JUN	2024	53								101798	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101798													WOS:001238524800001

Long-term change in metabolism phenology in north temperate lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The phenology of dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics and metabolism in north temperate lakes offers a basis for comparing metabolic cycles over multi-year time scales. Although proximal control over lake DO can be attributed to metabolism and physical processes, how those processes evolve over decades largely remains unexplored. Metabolism phenology may reveal the importance of coherence among lakes and facilitate general conclusions about the controls on lake metabolism at regional scales. We developed a Bayesian modeling framework to estimate DO concentrations and metabolism in eight lakes in contrasting landscapes in Wisconsin, USA. We identify the DO and metabolism phenologies for each lake, and use those to compare how decadal patterns relate to trophic state and landscape setting. We show that lakes can be categorized by their hypolimnetic oxygen consumption dynamics, with oligotrophic lakes having a diverse set of patterns and eutrophic lakes having uniform trends of increased oxygen consumption over the last decade. Metabolism phenology is likewise diverse for oligotrophic lakes, whereas eutrophic lakes in southern Wisconsin share consistent long-term patterns of metabolic trends and seasonal DO consumption highlighting the importance of trophic state driving metabolism. Eutrophic lakes had higher magnitudes and more seasonal variation in net ecosystem production in contrast to oligotrophic lakes. Generally, long-term metabolic trends of north temperate lakes suggest a limited influence of climate on lake metabolism and that temporal coherence of long-term metabolism change is driven primarily by the landscape setting.

Seasonal hydrology and fish assemblage structure in the floodplain of the lower Amazon River	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We investigated how the taxonomic and functional structures of fish assemblages in the lower Amazon River floodplain responded to seasonal hydrological variations. Fishes were sampled in 440 aquatic habitats across a floodplain area of 17,673 km(2)during periods of high, receding, low and rising water. In addition, we recorded local environmental and landscape variables known to affect fish assemblages in floodplains. Redundancy analysis indicated that the taxonomic and functional structures of the fish assemblages were associated with water levels as well as local environmental, landscape and spatial variables. Our results showed that piscivores, planktivores and omnivores, as well as species with periodic and intermediate life history strategies, dominated the floodplain fish assemblages during periods of high-water levels, whereas herbivores, invertivores and detritivores, as well as species of large body size with an equilibrium life history strategy, dominated the fish assemblages during periods of low-water levels. Hydrology strongly influenced the structure of the fish assemblages in the Amazon floodplains. Our results indicate that the maintenance of seasonal hydrological dynamics in the basin is essential for the conservation of the regional fish diversity.

Hypoxia's impact on pelagic fish populations in Lake Erie: a tale of two planktivores	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Whether bottom hypoxia has long-lasting consequences for pelagic fish populations remains speculative for most ecosystems. We explored hypoxia's influence on two pelagic zooplanktivores in Lake Erie that have different thermal preferences: cold-water rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and warm-water emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides). To assess acute effects, we combined predictive bioenergetics-based modeling with field collections made across the hypoxic season in central Lake Erie during 2005 and 2007. To assess chronic effects, we related fishery-independent and fishery-dependent catches with hypoxia severity and top predator (walleye, Sander vitreus) abundance during 1986-2014. As our modeling predicted, hypoxia altered rainbow smelt movement and distributions, leading to avoidance of cold, hypoxic bottom waters. In response, diets shifted from benthic to pelagic organisms, and consumption and energetic condition declined. These changes were lacking in emerald shiners. Our long-term analyses showed rainbow smelt abundance and hypoxia to be negatively related and suggested that hypoxia avoidance increases susceptibility to commercial fishing and walleye predation. Collectively, our findings indicate that hypoxia can negatively affect pelagic fish populations over the long term, especially those requiring cold water.					; Stone, Joshua/AGW-7398-2022; Ludsin, Stuart/F-2925-2010	Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; Stone, Joshua/0000-0001-6459-5240; Hook, Tomas/0000-0001-9185-6741													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2020	77	7					1131	1148		10.1139/cjfas-2019-0265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-0265													WOS:000543742600003

Tolerance of wolves in Wisconsin: A mixed-methods examination of policy effects on attitudes and behavioral inclinations	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Numerous studies report majorities of survey respondents hold positive attitudes toward wolves. However, a 2001-2009 panel study found declining tolerance of wolves among residents of Wisconsin's wolf range. Poaching, believed to be increasing, has been an important source of mortality in Wisconsin's wolf population since the 19805. We conducted focus groups, with an accompanying anonymous questionnaire survey of participants, among farmers and hunters in Wisconsin's wolf range to gain a more indepth understanding of attitudes towards wolves and inclinations to poach wolves. Whereas our study was originally designed to examine the effects of an experimental lethal-control program on inclination to poach, oscillating wolf-management authority shifted our focus from a single intervention to a suite of changes in policy and management. Following federal delisting of the Western Great Lakes wolf population in January 2012, Wisconsin implemented lethal-depredation control and created the state's first legalized wolf-harvest season in October 2012. We convened focus groups before and after these changes. Pre- and post-survey results showed majorities of respondents held negative attitudes toward wolves with no decrease in inclination to poach, suggesting lethal-control measures, in the short term, may be ineffective for increasing tolerance. Participants expressed favorable attitudes toward lethal-control measures, but believed there were limitations in the implementation of the lethal-control measures. Focus group discussions revealed elements of positivity toward wolves not revealed by questionnaires, as well as several thematic areas, such as fear, empowerment, and trust, that may inform the development of interventions designed to increase tolerance of wolves and other controversial species.

Lake George showed modest seasonal and spatial variations, and lower partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) (26 & PLUSMN; 16 ppm, mean & PLUSMN; standard deviation), CH4 (234 & PLUSMN; 208 nmol/L) and N2O saturation levels (%N2O) (80 & PLUSMN; 9 %) than Lake Edward (404 & PLUSMN; 145 ppm, 357 & PLUSMN; 483 nmol/L, 139 & PLUSMN; 222 %). Surface waters in both lakes were over-saturated in CH4, and Lake George was under-saturated in CO2 while Lake Edward was slightly over-saturated in CO2. This difference was related to higher phytoplankton biomass in Lake George than Lake Edward, with average chlorophyll-a concentrations of 177 & PLUSMN; 125 and 18 & PLUSMN; 25 lg/L, respectively. Permanent high cyanobacterial biomass in Lake George led to uniform dissolved CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations. In surface waters of Lake Edward, spatial variations of pCO2, CH4 and N2O were related to bottom depth, and locally (in particular in Katwe Bay) also related to the inputs of water from Lake George via the Kazinga Channel, a 40-km natural channel connecting the lakes. Short-term mixing events related to storms increased CO2, CH4 and N2O content in surface waters, in particular for CH4 and N2O. This indicates that mixing events in response to storms can create 'hot moments' for CH4 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere in tropical lakes, given the weaker vertical density gradients compared to higher latitude systems.& COPY; 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Groundwater Recharge Estimation in Upper Gelana Watershed, South-Western Main Ethiopian Rift Valley	SUSTAINABILITY												Estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge through integrated water balance modeling plays an important role in sustainable groundwater resource management. Such modeling effort is particularly essential for data-scarce regions, such as the Rift Valley Lake basin in the Basement Complex of Ethiopia, which has shallow aquifers, a proliferation of wells, and poor groundwater monitoring networks. A spatially distributed water balance model (WetSpass), along with GIS and remote sensing tools, was used for groundwater recharge estimation for its suitability and efficiency in data-scarce hydrogeological regions. The WetSpass model depicted a very good performance in simulating the groundwater recharge in the Upper Gelana watershed within the Rift Valley Lake basin. The water balance analysis revealed that about 7% of the mean annual rainfall is converted to groundwater recharge, and the remaining rainfall amounts are partitioned into surface runoff (19%) and evapotranspiration (75%). The model simulation outputs are also used to investigate the relative influences of biophysical driving factors on the water balance components. While the land use types had a greater influence on the actual evapotranspiration processes, the soil texture classes were the dominant factors in the surface runoff and groundwater recharge processes in the watershed. The groundwater recharge rates were found to be higher than 400 mm/yr in the central parts (Fisehagenent, Tore, and Gedeb) and lower than 165 mm/yr in the southern parts (Hageremariam) of the watershed. The areal proportions of the low, medium, and high recharging parts of the watershed are, respectively, estimated as 15%, 68%, and 17% of the watershed area. Therefore, the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge should be taken into consideration in developing a sustainable groundwater resources management plan for the Upper Gelana watershed. Managed aquifer recharge can be adopted in high and medium groundwater recharging parts of the watershed to capture stormwater runoff during the wet season to improve the groundwater supply during dry months. Furthermore, monthly groundwater withdrawals should be regulated according to the spatial and temporal patterns of the groundwater recharge in the watershed.

Evolution of water quality in rainwater harvesting systems during long-term storage in non-rainy seasons	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The development of rainwater utilization strategies has relied on rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems for centuries to alleviate the pressure on water resources. However, there are still significant knowledge gaps regarding the changes in water quality in RWH systems during long-term storage in non-rainy seasons. This study evaluated the water quality processes in RWH systems through static rainwater storage experiments for approximately 60 days. The results revealed that nutrients in rainwater accumulated in sediment during storage. Disturbance and redox conditions at the rainwater-sediment interface contribute to the release of sedimentary facies materials. The rainwater showed distinct DO stratification, with the biochemical reactions of sedimentary facies being the primary factor driving oxygen consumption. ORP and turbidity showed positive correlations with COD (r = 0.582; 0.572), TOC (r = 0.678; 0.681), TN (r = 0.452; 0.439), and NH4+-N (r = 0.502; 0.553) (P < 0.05). The regulation of water quality and extension of the usage cycle were identified as critical factors influenced by DO. In addition, bacteria share similar ecological niche preferences. These findings provide scientific evidence for the high-quality reuse of rainwater in decentralized RWH systems during long-term storage in non-rainy seasons.

The three-year mean concentrations (mg/kg) of Cr, Cu, Pb, Cd, Hg and As were 91.33, 36.27, 54.82, 4.39, 0.19 and 25.67, respectively, which were all higher than the corresponding background values. Sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and Geo-accumulation index (I-geo) were used for the assessment of pollution level of heavy metals. The pollution risk of Cd, Hg and As were great and that of Cr needed urgent attention because of its obvious increase. Pollution load index (PLI) and geographic information system (GIS) methods were conducted to assess spatial and temporal variation of heavy metal contamination. Results confirmed an increased contamination contribution inflow from Xiang River. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to identify contribution sources of heavy metal, which showed anthropogenic origin mainly from mining, smelting, chemical industry and agricultural activity.

J	Yuan, Y; Liu, BL; Liu, H				Yuan, Yi; Liu, Baolin; Liu, Hao			Spatial distribution and source identification for heavy metals in surface sediments of East Dongting Lake, China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Dongting Lake is one of the most important inland freshwater lakes in China. To investigate the spatial distribution and seasonal variation characteristics of heavy metals (Cr, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) in the lake, 53 surface sediment samples were collected in the East Dongting Lake (ED Lake) in the wet and dry seasons. Results show Cr, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb contents were 1.7 (1.9), 1.8 (2.0), 2.9 (3.0), 1.9 (1.9), 11.7 (13.1), and 2.0 (2.2)-fold of their geochemical soil background values of Hunan province (China) in the wet (dry) season. Spatial and seasonal heterogeneity could be found in the distribution of Cr, Co, Cu, Zn, and Pb in the surface sediments. The enrichment factor (EF) suggested that Cd has reached severe enrichment in the sediment. The result of the geo-accumulation index (I-geo) indicated that Cr, Co, Cu, Zn, and Pb were at levels corresponding to low contamination, and moderately to highly polluted with Cd. Multivariate statistical analysis including pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis was used for the identification of potential sources of the heavy metals in the sediments. The results showed that Cu, Zn, and Pb from the sediments of the East Dongting Lake in the wet and dry seasons were possibly anthropogenic sources, such as emissions from mining and smelting while Al, Fe, and Cr are attributed for natural sources. Cd enrichment in the sediments is influenced by both natural factors, and human activities in local areas.																			2045-2322					MAY 13	2022	12	1							7940	10.1038/s41598-022-12148-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12148-x								35562582					WOS:000803217300014

Contrasting arsenic cycling in strongly and weakly stratified contaminated lakes: Evidence for temperature control on sediment-water arsenic fluxes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Arsenic contamination of lakebed sediments is widespread due to a range of human activities, including herbicide application, waste disposal, mining, and smelter operations. The threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health is dependent on the degree of mobilization from sediments into overlying water columns and exposure of aquatic organisms. We undertook a mechanistic investigation of arsenic cycling in two impacted lakes within the Puget Sound region, a shallow weakly stratified lake and a deep seasonally stratified lake, with similar levels of lakebed arsenic contamination. We found that the processes that cycle arsenic between sediments and the water column differed greatly in shallow and deep lakes. In the shallow lake, seasonal temperature increases at the lakebed surface resulted in high porewater arsenic concentrations that drove larger diffusive fluxes of arsenic across the sediment-water interface compared to the deep, stratified lake where the lakebed remained similar to 10 degrees C cooler. Plankton in the shallow lake accumulated up to an order of magnitude more arsenic than plankton in the deep lake due to elevated aqueous arsenic concentrations in oxygenated waters and low phosphate : arsenate ratios in the shallow lake. As a result, strong arsenic mobilization from sediments in the shallow lake was countered by large arsenic sedimentation rates out of the water column driven by plankton settling.					; Barrett, Pamela/JEZ-8259-2023	Neumann, Rebecca B/0000-0003-3464-9046; Gawel, James/0000-0002-1595-3678; Barrett, Pamela/0000-0003-3405-5328													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2019	64	3					1333	1346		10.1002/lno.11119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11119								31741542					WOS:000467593600033

Permafrost and lakes control river isotope composition across a boreal Arctic transect in the Western Siberian lowlands	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Western Siberian Lowlands (WSL) store large quantities of organic carbon that will be exposed and mobilized by the thawing of permafrost. The fate of mobilized carbon, however, is not well understood, partly because of inadequate knowledge of hydrological controls in the region which has a vast low-relief surface area, extensive lake and wetland coverage and gradually increasing permafrost influence. We used stable water isotopes to improve our understanding of dominant landscape controls on the hydrology of the WSL. We sampled rivers along a 1700 km South-North transect from permafrost-free to continuous permafrost repeatedly over three years, and derived isotope proxies for catchment hydrological responsiveness and connectivity. We found correlations between the isotope proxies and catchment characteristics, suggesting that lakes and wetlands are intimately connected to rivers, and that permafrost increases the responsiveness of the catchment to rainfall and snowmelt events, reducing catchment mean transit times. Our work provides rare isotope-based field evidence that permafrost and lakes/wetlands influence hydrological pathways across a wide range of spatial scales (10-10(5) km(2)) and permafrost coverage (0%-70%). This has important implications, because both permafrost extent and lake/wetland coverage are affected by permafrost thaw in the changing climate. Changes in these hydrological landscape controls are likely to alter carbon export and emission via inland waters, which may be of global significance.

It is characterized by a strong seasonality of climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons and has been classified as a hypereutrophic lake. This eutrophication was driven by improperly treated sewage discharges from four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and by excessive agricultural activities, including the overuse of fertilizers that reach the lake through surface runoff during the rainy season. This nutrient rich runoff has caused algal blooms, which have led to anoxic or hypoxic conditions, resulting in large-scale fish deaths that have occurred during or immediately after the rainy season. This study investigated the changes in the phytoplankton community in Lake Cajititlan during the rainy season and the association between these changes and the physicochemical water quality and environmental parameters measured in the lake's basin. Planktothrix and Cylindrospermopsis were the dominant genera of the cyanobacterial community, while the Chlorophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and Trebouxiophyceae classes dominated the microalgae community. However, the results showed a significant temporal shift in the phytoplankton communities in Lake Cajititlan induced by the rainy season. The findings of this study suggest that significant climatic variations cause high seasonal surface runoff and rapid changes in the water quality (Chlorophyll-a, DO, NH4+, and NO3-) and in variations in the composition of the phytoplankton community. Finally, an alternation between phosphorus and nitrogen limitation was observed in Lake Cajititlan during the rainy season, clearly correlating to the presence of Planktothrix when the lake was limited by phosphorus and to the presence of Cylindrospermopsis when the lake was limited by nitrogen. The evidence presented in this study supports the idea that the death of fish in Lake Cajititlan could be mainly caused by anoxia, caused by rapid changes in water quality during the rainy season. Based on our review of the literature, this is the first study on the phytoplankton community in a subtropical lake during the rainy season using high throughput 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing.					; Pacheco, Adriana/B-7448-2011; Lugo, Yadira/AAS-7483-2021; de Anda, José/HTS-2413-2023; Senés-Guerrero, Carolina/AAT-2254-2021; DIAZ TORRES, OSIRIS/ISB-3807-2023; Hernández, Misael/ABD-1937-2020	de Anda, Jose/0000-0001-9521-5968; Gradilla Hernandez, Misael Sebastian/0000-0002-8236-4400; Pacheco, Adriana/0000-0002-9512-7674; Orozco-Nunnelly, Danielle Annette/0000-0003-3381-0504; Diaz Torres, Osiris/0000-0002-6211-245X; 														1664-302X				MAR 9	2021	12								617151	10.3389/fmicb.2021.617151	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.617151								33767675					WOS:000631556800001

Anadromous Arctic Char Microbiomes: Bioprospecting in the High Arctic	FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												Northern populations of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) can be anadromous, migrating annually from the ocean to freshwater lakes and rivers in order to escape sub-zero temperatures. Such seasonal behavior demands that these fish and their associated microbiomes adapt to changes in salinity, temperature, and other environmental challenges. We characterized the microbial community composition of anadromous S. alpinus, netted by Inuit fishermen at freshwater and seawater fishing sites in the high Arctic, both under ice and in open water. Bacterial profiles were generated by DNA extraction and high-throughput sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Results showed that microbial communities on the skin and intestine of Arctic char were statistically different when sampled from freshwater or saline water sites. This association was tested using hierarchical Ward's linkage clustering, showing eight distinct clusters in each of the skin and intestinal microbiomes, with the clusters reflecting sampling location between fresh and saline environments, confirming a salinity-linked turnover. This analysis also provided evidence for a core composition of skin and intestinal bacteria, with the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria presenting as major phyla within the skin-associated microbiomes. The intestine-associated microbiome was characterized by unidentified genera from families Fusobacteriaceae, Comamonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Vibrionaceae. The salinity-linked turnover was further tested through ordinations that showed samples grouping based on environment for both skin- and intestine-associated microbiomes. This finding implies that core microbiomes between fresh and saline conditions could be used to assist in regulating optimal fish health in aquaculture practices. Furthermore, identified taxa from known psychrophiles and with nitrogen cycling properties suggest that there is additional potential for biotechnological applications for fish farm and waste management practices.																			2296-4185					FEB 26	2019	7								32	10.3389/fbioe.2019.00032	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2019.00032								30863748					WOS:000460106800001

Growing season drives the compositional changes and assembly processes of epiphytic bacterial communities of two submerged macrophytes in Taihu Lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Large amounts of epiphytic bacteria live on the leaf surfaces of submerged macrophytes in freshwater lakes. Despite their important roles in affecting host plant's health and biogeochemical cycling, knowledge about epiphytic bacteria assembly is not sufficient. We studied epiphytic bacteria on two cohabiting plant species in Taihu Lake, China. In comparison with plant identity and geographic distance, the plant-growing season played a prominent role in driving alpha and beta diversity (compositional variations) of epiphytic bacterial communities. Phylogeny-based null model analysis revealed that the growing season also drove the relative importance of deterministic versus stochastic processes underlying bacterial community assembly. In May when both plants start growth, the deterministic processes were most prominent, while in months later than June, the stochastic processes' effects increased substantially. In addition, we found a significant positive relationship between alpha diversity and compositional stochasticity, implying that stochastic processes may have great effects on the maintenance of diversity and functioning of epiphytic bacteria in aquatic ecosystems. In summary, the growing season overwhelmed plant identity and spatial site in shaping epiphytic bacterial communities in Taihu Lake, which may suggest new clues in understanding the dynamics of epiphytic communities and their roles in large shallow lacustrine ecosystems.

Whether machine learning models can be used to predict changes in phytoplankton community composition caused by water transfer projects have rarely been studied. In the present study, we used machine learning models to predict the total algal cell densities and changes in phytoplankton community composition in Miyun reservoir caused by the middle route of the South to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP). The model performances of four machine learning models, including regression trees (RT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) were evaluated and the best model was selected for further prediction. The results showed that the predictive accuracies (Pearson's correlation coefficient) of the models were RF (0.974), ANN (0.951), SVM (0.860), and RT (0.817) in the training step and RF (0.806), ANN (0.734), SVM (0.730), and RT (0.692) in the testing step. Therefore, the RF model was the best method for estimating total algal cell densities. Furthermore, the predicted accuracies of the RF model for dominant phytoplankton phyla (Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta) in Miyun reservoir ranged from 0.824 to 0.869 in the testing step. The predicted proportions with water transfer of the different phytoplankton phyla ranged from -8.88% to 9.93%, and the predicted dominant phyla with water transfer in each season remained unchanged compared to the phytoplankton succession without water transfer. The results of the present study provide a useful tool for predicting the changes in phytoplankton community caused by water transfer. The method is transferrable to other locations via establishment of models with relevant data to a particular area. Our findings help better understanding the possible changes in aquatic ecosystems influenced by inter-basin water transfer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epiphytic biofilms significantly impact the health of the host vegetation and the biogeochemical cycling of lake elements. However, community diversity, species interactions, and community assembly mechanisms in epiphytic bacterial communities (EBCs) of plants during different growth periods are not well understood. We investigated the successional dynamics, co-occurrence patterns, and community assembly processes of epiphytic biofilm bacterial communities of submerged plants, Najas marina and Potamogeton lucens, from July to November 2020. The results showed a significant seasonal variation in EBC diversity and richness. Community diversity and richness increased from July to November, and the temperature was the most important driving factor for predicting seasonal changes in EBC community structure. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the average degree and graph density of the network increased from July to November, indicating that the complexity of the EBC network increased. The bacterial community co-occurrence network was limited by temperature, pH, and transparency. The phylogeny-based null model analysis showed that deterministic processes dominated the microbial community assembly in different periods, increasing their contribution. In addition, we found that as the dominance of deterministic processes increased, the microbial co-occurrence links increased, and the potential interrelationships between species became stronger. Thus, the findings provide insights into the seasonal variability of EBC assemblage and co-occurrence patterns in lacustrine ecosystems.

Finding the harvesting frequency to maximize nutrient removal in a constructed wetland dominated by submerged aquatic plants	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality is still poor in many freshwater ecosystems around the world as a result of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Constructed wetlands can be used to remove excess nutrients. In these wetlands, helophytes or free floating aquatic plants are traditionally used to absorb the nutrients. The nutrients are subsequently exported upon harvesting of the plants. However, rooted submerged plants may be more effective to extract nutrients from moderately eutrophicated ecosystems than helophytes or floating species. Here, we tested how the frequency of harvesting affected submerged biomass production, biomass nutrient content and the resulting amount of nutrients removed, as well as the vegetation composition and structure. Two Myriophyllum spicatum dominated shallow ponds, with moderately low surface water nutrient loading (similar to 5.6 mg N.m(-2).d(-1) and similar to 1.32 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were used. Each pond was subjected to four harvesting treatments: mowing lx, 2x, 3 x or 5 x between May and September 2015. Harvesting 2 x or 3 x removed most biomass and nutrients, while mowing either 5 x or only once at the end of the growing season removed the lowest amount of nutrients from the system. Furthermore, the dominance of M. spicatum in the vegetation was best maintained in plots mown 2 x, while its cover declined in plots mown more frequently, resulting in an increase of charophyte abundance. We conclude that harvesting at an intermediate frequency is best when aiming to remove the maximum amount of nutrients under a moderately low nutrient loading. Harvesting more frequently may be a suitable management method to reduce dominance of M. spicatum in situations where it causes nuisance problems due to massive growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Forest, fire & monsoon: investigating the long-term threshold dynamics of south-east Asia's seasonally dry tropical forests	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Tropical forests are the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on earth, yet are particularly susceptible to future climatic and human-induced change. Identifying tipping points at which tropical ecosystems will reorganise is therefore an important research goal. Limited research within the seasonally dry tropical forests of south-east Asia means that much uncertainty exists around the resilience of these systems to future global change. This is a critical research gap because these forests should - given their physiognomic attributes, current bioclimatic envelope and the range of stressors - be very sensitive to a stable-state shift to savanna. Here we adopt a palaeoecological approach to examine the interaction between key drivers of change (decreased precipitation and heightened fire activity) and forest response over -4700 years though interrogation of sediment-based proxies from volcanic crater lakes within north-east Cambodia - in the core range of southeast Asia's tropical dry forests. Our results suggest that rapidly regenerating, secondary forest taxa are important for maintaining a forested state when the landscape is subject to moderate fire and climatic disturbance. However, when these stressors are amplified, recovery and resistance traits associated with key deciduous dipterocarp forest taxa appear critical for forest stability. Notably, shifts from more closed, seasonal evergreen forest formations to more open secondary/deciduous dipterocarp formations appear reversible when the stressors are removed, suggesting that these transitions are not analogous with the difficult-to-reverse, forest-to-savanna stable state shifts that occur elsewhere in Neotropical and Afrotropical settings. Our results indicate that the resilience of south-east Asian forests to climatic forcing appears contingent on the maintenance of secondary forest, deciduous forest, and seasonal evergreen dry forest mosaics across the ecoregion. This has implications for the conservation and wise-use of mainland south-east Asia's lowland dry forests. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Taxonomic composition and lake bathymetry influence fatty acid export via emergent insects	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The ecological role of emergent aquatic insects from lakes in exporting dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) across the freshwater-land interface is still poorly understood. 2. In this field study, we explored the seasonal biomass export of emergent insects from three subalpine lakes and investigated how lipids of emergent insects were related to lake bathymetry, lipids of organic matter in lake sediments (i.e., basal resources), and the taxonomic composition of insects. 3. The total lipid and PUFA fluxes of emergent insects were strongly related to taxonomy and lake bathymetry, but weakly associated with the PUFA content of the uppermost lake sediment layers. PUFA flux estimates of the dominant taxon, Chironomidae, from the shallowest lake (3 m depth; 125 g PUFA m(-2) season(-1)) were considerably higher than those from the deepest lake (33 m depth; 56 g PUFA m(-2) season(-1)), due to the higher per area biomass of emergent insects from this shallow lake. Insect taxonomy also affected the composition of PUFA transfer to land: Chironomidae were richer in omega-6 PUFA, such as linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), whereas Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera contained more omega-3 PUFA, especially alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3). 4. Our findings suggest that taxon-specific differences in PUFA content and lake bathymetry jointly shape PUFA fluxes and thus the provisioning of emergent insects as dietary sources of physiologically important PUFA for riparian consumers.					; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021; Mathieu-Resuge, Margaux/AAW-4299-2021; Mathieu-Resuge, Margaux/I-2010-2017; Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik/C-6361-2011; Twining, Cornelia/AAS-3939-2020	Parmar, Tarn Preet/0000-0002-1321-6893; Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504; Mathieu-Resuge, Margaux/0000-0001-6927-3400; Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik/0000-0002-4248-0730; Twining, Cornelia/0000-0002-4346-8856; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2021	66	12					2199	2209		10.1111/fwb.13819	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13819		SEP 2021											WOS:000696432200001

Whole-Lake CO2 Dynamics in Response to Storm Events in Two Morphologically Different Lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												In lentic systems, hydrology can be dramatically altered after storm events, potentially modifying the carbon budget. In particular, rapid increases in the surface water carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) have been observed following such events. Several processes may explain these shifts in lake CO2 dynamics, including vertical mixing, increases in metabolism, and increases in external loading. To evaluate the relative importance of these various processes, we reconstructed the whole-lake daily CO2 budget using concurrent estimates of lake metabolism and daily CO2 mass balance budgets in two lakes with distinct morphometries located in Qu,bec, Canada. We found that storm events caused variable, but significant, changes in whole-lake CO2 mass. Such events influenced CO2 dynamics indirectly by inducing shifts in lake metabolism, and directly by importing CO2 by the inflowing storm waters. Storm intensity (in terms of total amount of precipitation) influences the balance between these two processes, but the final outcome depends on lake morphometry. Our results suggest that when storms are intense enough to drive lake water renewal rate beyond 1% day(-1), external CO2 loadings became the dominant process, overwhelming internal CO2 production. Lakes with slower hydrological turnover, however, are more susceptible to internal regulation and may simply re-allocate CO2 from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion following a storm event. Our results thus suggest that this tightening of the watershed-lake-atmosphere linkage by climatic events is strongly modulated by lake morphometry. These features should be considered when predicting the impact of future climate change on regional C budgets and emissions.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240													1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2014	17	8					1338	1353		10.1007/s10021-014-9799-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9799-8													WOS:000345137900003

Sinninghe			Molecular records of climate variability and vegetation response since the Late Pleistocene in the Lake Victoria basin, East Africa	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												New molecular proxies of temperature and hydrology are helping to constrain tropical climate change and elucidate possible forcing mechanisms during the Holocene. Here, we examine a similar to 14,000 year record of climate variability from Lake Victoria, East Africa, the world's second largest freshwater lake by surface area. We determined variations in local hydroclimate using compound specific delta D of terrestrial leaf waxes, and compared these results to a new record of temperature utilizing the TEX86 paleo-temperature proxy, based on aquatic Thaumarchaeotal membrane lipids. In order to assess the impact of changing climate on the terrestrial environment, we generated a record of compound specific delta C-13 from terrestrial leaf waxes, a proxy for ecosystem-level C-3/C-4 plant abundances, and compared the results to previously published pollen-inferred regional vegetation shifts. We observe a general coherence between temperature and rainfall, with a warm, wet interval peaking similar to 10-9 ka and subsequent gradual cooling and drying over the remainder of the Holocene. These results, particularly those of rainfall, are in general agreement with other tropical African climate records, indicating a somewhat consistent view of climate over a wide region of tropical East Africa. The delta C-13 record from Lake Victoria leaf waxes does not appear to reflect changes in regional climate or vegetation. However, palynological analyses document an abrupt shift from a Poaceae (grasses)-dominated ecosystem during the cooler, arid late Pleistocene to a Moraceae-dominated (trees/shrubs) landscape during the warm, wet early Holocene. We theorize that these proxies are reflecting vegetation in different locations around lake Victoria. Our results suggest a predominantly insolation-forced climate, with warm, wet conditions peaking at the maximum interhemispheric seasonal insolation contrast, likely intensifying monsoonal precipitation, while maximum aridity coincides with the rainy season insolation and the interhemispheric contrast gradient minima. We interpret a shift in conditions at the Younger Dryas to indicate a limited switch in insolation-dominated control on climate of the Lake Victoria region, to remote teleconnections with the coupled Atlantic and Pacific climate system. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, Y; Jiao, JJ; Luo, X				Liu, Yi; Jiao, Jiu Jimmy; Luo, Xin			Effects of inland water level oscillation on groundwater dynamics and land-sourced solute transport in a coastal aquifer	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Inland groundwater level variation widely exists but is usually neglected when conducting research on flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers. A variable-saturation and variable density flow and transport model (FEFLOW) is applied to investigate groundwater dynamics and land-sourced solute transport in a coastal aquifer under the influence of groundwater level oscillation at inland boundary and tidal fluctuation at seaward boundary over a period of two years. The wave number shows that the damping rate of the seasonal oscillation at the inland boundary when propagating in the aquifer is much smaller than that of the tidal fluctuation, thus the seasonal oscillation can propagate a longer distance. The damping forms of the amplitude of both signals are exponential when propagating in the aquifer even though the amplitudes and the periods are different. For the base conditions simulated, the size of the upper saline plume (USP), i.e., recirculated seawater driven by tidal fluctuation, fluctuates periodically in response to the groundwater level oscillation at inland boundary. The fluctuation of the USP controls the movement of freshwater discharge tube (FDT) and the upper part of seawater wedge (SW). Therefore, the SW-freshwater interface shows a rotating instead of parallel movement. As groundwater system in a coastal aquifer is a mixed convection system, a modified Rayleigh number is adopted to investigate the density-induced instabilities associated with the transport of dense solute under the effect of groundwater level oscillation at inland boundary and tidal fluctuation. The more obvious. gravity-induced instabilities (i.e., stronger solute downwelling and freshwater upwelling) are observed at lower groundwater level. The finger plume and the upwelled freshwater mix well when approaching the discharge zone where strongly affected by tidal fluctuation. Consequently, the high concentration of the plumes is diluted when migrating toward the sea. Sensitive analysis indicates that the hydraulic conductivity and the density of the solute are the dominant impact factors for the morphology, horizontal and vertical movements of the land-sourced solute plume. The amplitude and period of the fluctuating signal at the inland boundary have minor influence on the morphology and instabilities of the finger plume. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results showed severe faecal contamination of waters compared to the WHO standards, and the FIB load levels (Mesophilic aerobic bacteria (MAB), Total coliforms (TC), Faecal coliforms (FC), and Faecal streptococci (FS)) were varied between stations (Kruskal-Wallis test (K) = 703; p < 0.01) and seasons (Fisher's test (F) = 2.13; p < 0.01). However, the presence of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus sp., Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas sp., Vibrio cholerae, and other bacteria indicative of faecal contamination were reported. Water temperature (WT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were within the WHO standards for surface waters, except pH for some stations on KW and NG rivers, where it was highly alkaline. The highest nutrients concentrations (PO43-, NH4+, NO2- and NO3-) were recorded in the dry season for all stations, except in KW and NG rivers from the midstream to downstream stations. The structural equations regression model (F test, p <= 0.05 with R-2) indicated a significant (p <= 0.05) positive correlation between the value of physicochemical parameters (WT, pH, PO43-, NH4+, NO2- and NO3-) and that of detected FIB numbers, except for DO which negatively affects bacteria numbers. The FC/FS ratio (1.01 - 4.30) linked polluted waters to human sources while the COD/BOD5 ratio (1.90 - 2.39) categorized them under domestic origin wastewater. The current degradation status of these rivers require a rapid waste management strategy and an efficient sanitation plan development along each catchment. Installation of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with biological treatment can mitigate the ecological and health risks of the rivers and the coastal zone of Lake Kivu.

Classification of Australian Waterbodies across a Wide Range of Optical Water Types	REMOTE SENSING												Baseline determination and operational continental scale monitoring of water quality are required for reporting on marine and inland water progress to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This study aims to improve our knowledge of the optical complexity of Australian waters. A workflow was developed to cluster the modelled spectral response of a range of in situ bio-optical observations collected in Australian coastal and continental waters into distinct optical water types (OWTs). Following clustering and merging, most of the modelled spectra and modelled specific inherent optical properties (SIOP) sets were clustered in 11 OWTs, ranging from clear blue coastal waters to very turbid inland lakes. The resulting OWTs were used to classify Sentinel-2 MSI surface reflectance observations extracted over relatively permanent water bodies in three drainage regions in Eastern Australia. The satellite data classification demonstrated clear limnological and seasonal differences in water types within and between the drainage divisions congruent with general limnological, topographical, and climatological factors. Locations of unclassified observations can be used to inform where in situ bio-optical data acquisition may be targeted to capture a more comprehensive characterization of all Australian waters. This can contribute to global initiatives like the SDGs and increases the diversity of natural water in global databases.

Modelling potential range expansion of an underutilised food security crop in Sub-Saharan Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Despite substantial growth in global agricultural production, food and nutritional insecurity is rising in Sub-Saharan Africa. Identification of underutilised indigenous crops with useful food security traits may provide part of the solution. Enset (Ensete ventricosum) is a perennial banana relative with cultivation restricted to southwestern Ethiopia, where high productivity and harvest flexibility enables it to provide a starch staple for similar to 20 million people. An extensive wild distribution suggests that a much larger region may be climatically suitable for cultivation. Here we use ensemble ecological niche modelling to predict the potential range for enset cultivation within southern and eastern Africa. We find contemporary bioclimatic suitability for a 12-fold range expansion, equating to 21.9% of crop land and 28.4% of the population in the region. Integration of crop wild relative diversity, which has broader climate tolerance, could enable a 19-fold expansion, particularly to dryer and warmer regions. Whilst climate change may cause a 37%-52% reduction in potential range by 2070, large centres of suitability remain in the Ethiopian Highlands, Lake Victoria region and the Drakensberg Range. We combine our bioclimatic assessment with socioeconomic data to identify priority areas with high population density, seasonal food deficits and predominantly small-scale subsistence agriculture, where integrating enset may be particularly feasible and deliver climate resilience. When incorporating the genetic potential of wild populations, enset cultivation might prove feasible for an additional 87.2-111.5 million people, 27.7-33 million of which are in Ethiopia outside of enset's current cultivation range. Finally, we consider explanations why enset cultivation has not expanded historically, and ethical implications of expanding previously underutilised species.					; Rosa, Isabel/F-8600-2010; Pironon, Samuel/AAE-4459-2021; Borrell, James/I-7556-2019; Mengesha, Wendawek Abebe/JHV-0564-2023	Ondo, Ian/0000-0001-7816-5882; mengesha, Wendawek Abebe/0000-0002-6426-3489; Rosa, Isabel/0000-0001-8257-1963; Borrell, James/0000-0001-9902-7681; Koch, Olef/0009-0008-4259-6080													1748-9326					JAN	2022	17	1							014022	10.1088/1748-9326/ac40b2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac40b2													WOS:000736304300001

We investigate the C and N pools in two thermokarst-affected yedoma landscapes - on Sobo-Sise Island and on Bykovsky Peninsula in the north of eastern Siberia. Soil cores up to 3m depth were collected along geomorphic gradients and analysed for organic C and N contents. A high vertical sampling density in the profiles allowed the calculation of C and N stocks for short soil column intervals and enhanced understanding of within-core parameter variability. Profile-level C and N stocks were scaled to the landscape level based on landform classifications from 5 m resolution, multispectral RapidEye satellite imagery. Mean landscape C and N storage in the first metre of soil for Sobo-Sise Island is estimated to be 20.2 kg C m(-2) and 1.8 kg N m(-2) and for Bykovsky Peninsula 25.9 kg C m(-2) and 2.2 kg N m(-2). Radiocarbon dating demonstrates the Holocene age of thermokarst basin deposits but also suggests the presence of thick Holoceneage cover layers which can reach up to 2 m on top of intact yedoma landforms. Reconstructed sedimentation rates of 0.10-0.57 mm yr(-1) suggest sustained mineral soil accumulation across all investigated landforms. Both yedoma and thermokarst landforms are characterized by limited accumulation of organic soil layers (peat). We further estimate that an active layer deepening of about 100 cm will increase organic C availability in a seasonally thawed state in the two study areas by similar to 5.8 Tg (13.2 kg C m(-2)). Our study demonstrates the importance of increasing the number of C and N storage inventories in ice-rich yedoma and thermokarst environments in order to account for high variability of permafrost and thermokarst environments in pan-permafrost soil C and N pool estimates.

In this study, we explore the use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data (MODIS, MODO9Q1 and MYDO9Q1 products, red (R) and near infrared (NIR) bands) to monitor turbidity and SSSC for the Bagre Reservoir in Burkina Faso. High values of these parameters associated with high spatial and temporal variability potentially challenge the methodologies developed so far for less turbid waters. Field measurements (turbidity, SSSC, radiometry) are used to evaluate different radiometric indices. The NIR/R ratio is found to be the most suited to retrieve SSSC and turbidity for both in-situ spectoradiometer measurements and satellite reflectance from MODIS. The spatio temporal variability of MODIS NIR/R together with rainfall estimated by the Tropical Rainforest Measuring Mission (TRMM) and altimetry data from Jason-2 is analyzed over the Bagre Reservoir for the 2000-2015 period. It is found that rain events of the early rainy season (February-March) through mid-rainy season (August) are decisive in triggering turbidity increase. Sediment transport is observed in the reservoir from upstream to downstream between June and September. Furthermore, a significant increase of 19% in turbidity values is observed between 2000 and 2015, mainly for the July to December period. It is especially well marked for August, with the central and downstream areas showing the largest increase. The most probable hypothesis to explain this evolution is a change in land use, and particularly an increase in the amount of bare soils, which enhances particle transport by runoff.

Biogeography of the Australian monsoon tropics	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim This paper reviews the biogeography of the Australian monsoon tropical biome to highlight general patterns in the distribution of a range of organisms and their environmental correlates and evolutionary history, as well as to identify knowledge gaps. Location Northern Australia, Australian Monsoon Tropics (AMT). The AMT is defined by areas that receive more than 85% of rainfall between November and April. Methods Literature is summarized, including the origin of the monsoon climate, present-day environment, biota and habitat types, and phylogenetic and geographical relationships of selected organisms. Results Some species are widespread throughout the AMT while others are narrow-range endemics. Such contrasting distributions correspond to present-day climates, hydrologies (particularly floodplains), geological features (such as sandstone plateaux), fire regimes, and vegetation types (ranging from rain forest to savanna). Biogeographical and phylogenetic studies of terrestrial plants (e.g. eucalypts) and animals (vertebrates and invertebrates) suggest that distinct bioregions within the AMT reflect the aggregated effects of landscape and environmental history, although more research is required to determine and refine the boundaries of biogeographical zones within the AMT. Phylogenetic analyses of aquatic organisms (fishes and prawns) suggest histories of associations with drainage systems, dispersal barriers, links to New Guinea, and the existence of Lake Carpentaria, now submerged by the Gulf of Carpentaria. Complex adaptations to the landscape and climate in the AMT are illustrated by a number of species. Main conclusions The Australian monsoon is a component of a single global climate system, characterized by a dominant equator-spanning Hadley cell. Evidence of hot, seasonally moist climates dates back to the Late Eocene, implying that certain endemic elements of the AMT biota have a long history. Vicariant differentiation is inferred to have separated the Kimberley and Arnhem Land bioregions from Cape York Peninsula/northern Queensland. Such older patterns are overlaid by younger events, including dispersal from Southeast Asia, and range expansions and contractions. Future palaeoecological and phylogenetic investigations will illuminate the evolution of the AMT biome. Understanding the biogeography of the AMT is essential to provide a framework for ecological studies and the sustainable development of the region.

J	Becher, GP; Johnson, MD				Becher, Gustaf Peterson; Johnson, Mark D.			Sedimentology and internal structure of murtoos-V-shaped landforms indicative of a dynamic subglacial hydrological system	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Knowledge about processes beneath ice sheets, and in particular the processes connected to subglacial hydrology, is crucial for an understanding of ice sheets and how they react in a warming climate. Recently, v-shaped subglacial landforms (murtoos) have been found in those parts of the former Fennoscandian Ice Sheet where rapid ice-margin retreat occurred. Based on their geomorphology and distribution, murtoos have been suggested to form where the bed experienced high influxes of meltwater. Here, we investigate the sedimentology and internal structure of murtoos at four localities in southern Sweden to better understand murtoo genesis. The excavated murtoos consist of heterogenous diamict showing reasonably strong fabrics interbedded with sorted sediments. Sediments show signs of ductile deformation and lquefaction. We interpret these landforms as sub glacial landforms created by till deposition and sedimentation from meltwater with subsequent deformation. Cross-cutting relationships and inter-bedding of sorted sediments suggest a stepwise formation including periodic deformation events. We propose a model that is based on a dynamic subglacial meltwater system. We suggest that the subglacial environment is within the distributed system where the bed receives meltwater from repeated influxes of supraglacially derived meltwater. The processes suggested in this model of formation are strikingly similar to the character of glaciological and hydrological dynamics observed on the Greenland ice sheet today. ? 2021 The Author(s).

While TWS changes have been increasingly studied based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived TWS dataset, spatio-temporal changes in TWS and the driving factors remain unexplored. Herein, Mann-Kendall test, Theil-Sen's slope estimator, empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), component contribution ratio (CCR), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models were employed. We found a slight spatial fluctuation of TWS, and groundwater could affect TWS variability in the EA region.& nbsp;New hydrological insights: High annual TWSC was observed in the southwestern and northern regions, reaching values of 220 and -100 mm/yr, respectively. Among lake basins, the maximum and minimum TWSC values attained 97.5 +/- 28.2 mm/yr and 24.8 +/- 7.7 mm/yr, in Victoria and Tana basins, respectively. The regional level groundwater contribution was about 42%, while 48%, 53%, and 46% were in Abaya-Chamo, Turkana, and Victoria basins, respectively. However, surface runoff contribution was 52% and 35% in Tana and Tanganyika basins, respectively. The seasonal TWS changes show substantial linkage with the lake basins' seasonal precipitation distribution. Our findings highlight the driving factors of TWS variability, which could help guiding water management policies, and promote satellite remote sensing datasets.					; Ayele, Gebiaw/D-3857-2017; Prodhan, Foyez/AAN-9543-2020; Demeke, yared/MCI-9945-2025; Zhang, Jiahua/KFS-4615-2024	SEKA, AYALKIBET M./0000-0001-6968-5608; Demeke, yared/0009-0002-1392-4846; Zhang, Jiahua/0000-0002-2894-9627; Ayele, Gebiaw T./0000-0003-4568-5528														2214-5818				JUN	2022	41								101094	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101094		APR 2022											WOS:000800415000002

Slate, dolomitic limestone, silty sandstone and rhythmite of the Krol Formation are the main rock types. The present study focuses on the investigation of slope stability in the region in terms of potential seismicity and landslide. Geological and geotechnical mapping indicates that the major portion of the area is characterized by slope wash materials and buildings. The combination of 3-4 joint sets with one random joint is the main structure at outcrops. The major geological structures of this area are Nainital lake fault passing from the center of the lake, Main Boundary Thrust at SW, and Khuriya Fault passing from the SE direction of Nainital City. This work finds that different types of discontinuities (e.g. joints and faults), overburden due to unplanned civil structures, and neotectonic activity in the vicinity of this area affect the stability of the city. The slate forms the base of the city, dipping slightly towards the lake side along the NW direction, thus accelerating the instability of this area. Rock mass rating (RMR), slope mass rating, factor of safety (FOS) and graphical analysis of the discontinuity for slope kinematics indicate that the study area is a landslide-prone zone. This study can facilitate reducing the risk of human life, and contribute to the ongoing construction works in the area. (C) 2018 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Assessment of surface water irrigation potential in the Ethiopian highlands: The Lake Tana Basin	CATENA												Although Ethiopia has a large potential to develop surface irrigation, only 5% of the 30 to 70 million hectares (ha) potentially available has been developed. To examine the underlying causes of this lack of irrigation development, this study evaluates the suitability of surface water irrigation for the Lake Tana Basin development corridor. Surface water availability and land potentially suitable for irrigation development were considered. Surface water potential was examined by analyzing long-term daily historical river discharges. Land suitable for irrigation was determined with a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation, which considers the interaction of various factors such as climate, river proximity, soil type, land cover, topography/slope, and market outlets. The results indicate that nearly 20% of the Lake Tana Basin is suitable for surface irrigation. However, after analyzing 27 years of river discharge, less than 3% of the potential irrigable area (or less than 0.25% of the basin area) could be irrigated consistently with runoff from the river systems. Thus, the irrigation potential in the Lake Tana Basin can be met by increasing dry season flows, by improving upland infiltration, by supplying water from reservoirs, or by pumping water directly from Lake Tana.

Monitoring flood extent in the lower Amazon River floodplain using ALOS/PALSAR ScanSAR images	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Amazon River floodplain is subject to large seasonal variations in water level and flood extent, due to the large size and low relief of the basin, and the large amount of precipitation in the region. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can be used to map flooded area in these wetlands, given its ability to provide continuous information without being heavily affected by cloud cover. As part of JAXA's Kyoto & Carbon Initiative, extensive wide-swath, multi-temporal SAR coverage of the Amazon basin has been obtained using the ScanSAR mode of ALOS PALSAR This study presents a method for monitoring flood extent variation using ALOS ScanSAR images, tested at the Curuai Lake floodplain, in the lower Amazon River, Brazil. Twelve ScanSAR scenes were acquired between 2006 and 2010, including seven during the 2007 hydrological year. Water level records, field photographs, optical images (Landsat-5/TM and MODIS/Ferra and Aqua) and topographic data were used as auxiliary information. A data mining algorithm allowed the implementation of a hierarchical, object-based classification algorithm, able to map land cover types and flooding status in the study area for all available dates. land cover based on the entire time series (classification levels 1 and 2) had overall accuracies of 90% and 83%, respectively. Level 3 classifications (one map per image date) were validated only for the lowest and highest water stages, with overall accuracies of 76% and 78%, respectively. Total flood extent (Level 4) was mapped with 84% and 94% accuracies, for the low and high water stages, respectively. Regression models were fitted between mapped flooded area and water levels at the Curuai gauge to predict flood extent. A polynomial model had R-2=0.95 (p<0.05) and an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 241 km(2), while a logistic model had R-2=0.98 (p<0.05) and RMSE = 127 km(2). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Seasonality of photochemical dissolved organic carbon mineralization and its relative contribution to pelagic CO2 production in northern lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Boreal and northern temperate lakes (hereinafter referred to as northern lakes) are sites of intense processing of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is reflected in part in the persistent CO2 supersaturation of their surface waters. These ecosystems are subject to strong seasonal fluctuations in both irradiance and DOC amount and quality, which in turn should result in temporal shifts in the magnitude of DOC photodegradation. Here we explore the temporal patterns in the magnitude of water column DOC photomineralization and its potential contribution to pelagic CO2 production in three northern lakes of different DOC content. We performed laboratory DOC photodegradation incubations and combined the resulting rates with field measurements and modeling to reconstruct the annual cycle in depth-integrated DOC photomineralization. We found that areal rates of DOC photomineralization were driven by both irradiance and intrinsic DOC photoreactivity, both of which showed seasonality. Over an annual cycle, depth-integrated DOC photomineralization rates were remarkably similar across lakes, averaging 4.4 (SD=0.7) g C m(-2)yr(-1) and daily rates followed an apparent seasonal pattern. The contribution of DOC photomineralization to total pelagic CO2 production (as the sum of respiration and DOC photomineralization) peaked after ice melt (up to 49%), averaging 14% for the entire open water season. Our study identifies potential hot periods of photochemical activity that result from the interplay between DOC properties and environmental conditions, which should be incorporated into models of lake functioning.

We compared the effectiveness of P-IBI with that of the water quality index (WQI) in assessing ecological health. Between April and October 2019, phytoplankton and water samples were collected at 17 sampling sites in the ASRB on a seasonal basis. Our results showed that seven phyla were identified, comprising 137 phytoplankton species. From a pool of 35 candidate indices, five critical ecological indices (Shannon-Wiener index, total biomass, percentage of motile diatoms, percentage of stipitate diatom, and diatom quotient) were selected to evaluate the biological integrity of phytoplankton in the ASRB. The ecological status of the ASRB as measured by the P-IBI and WQI exhibited a similar spatial pattern. It showed a spatial decline in ecological status in accordance with the flow of the river. These results highlighted that P-IBI was a reliable tool to indicate the interaction between habitat conditions and environmental factors in the ASRB. Our findings contribute to the ecological monitoring and protection of rivers impacted by anthropogenic pollution.

However, how hydrological isolation affects variations of DOM chemistry in large lake systems is still poorly understood. Here, optical properties and molecular compositions of DOM samples derived from a large river-connected lake (Poyang Lake, China) and its nearby seasonal sub-lakes (formed by hydrological isolation) were characterized using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The results revealed more abundance of organic matter in sub-lakes than that in the main lake according to high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and absorption coefficients (a254 and a280). Large proportions of CHOS formulas were identified by FT ICR MS in sub-lakes DOM, which were produced through Kraft reactions (sulfide/bisulfide + lignin CHO -> CHOS) in the interface of sediment/water, and greatly contributed to aliphatic compounds. In addition, obvious variations of compounds (such as polyphenols, highly unsaturated and aliphatic compounds) and lability of DOM were observed between sub-lakes and main lakes, which were mainly caused by the different degradation pathways of DOM (photodegradation in sub-lakes while biodegradation in the main lake). Our results demonstrated that hydro-logical isolation has significant impacts on DOM chemistry, and provides an improved understanding of the DOM bio-geochemistry process in Poyang Lake and supports the management of the large lake systems.

These 21 antibiotics were detected at least once in crabs from these provinces with detection frequencies of 3.70-90.91%. Sulfonamides were detected in 53.7% of the samples at concentrations of 0.1?10 ?g/kg in Jiangsu, while quinolones were detected with 90.9% of samples containing concentrations of 1?100 ?g/kg in Liaoning province. Enroflxacin, ciprofloxacin, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfameter, sulfadoxine, and sulfamethoxazole were the mainly used antibiotics and enroflxacin were present at a high concentration (>100 ?g/kg). Dietary assessments showed that residual antibiotics in crabs from China were far below the maximum residue limit (MRL) of total sulfonamides and quinolones, and there was almost no risk associated with crab consumption. These results will provide meaningful indications for the safety of crab consumption.					song, chao/HTO-8527-2023														0025-326X	1879-3363				APR	2021	165								112184	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112184		FEB 2021						33621905					WOS:000636284000006

M.			Linking Dissolved Organic Matter Composition to Landscape Properties in Wetlands Across the United States of America	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Wetlands are integral to the global carbon cycle, serving as both a source and a sink for organic carbon. Their potential for carbon storage will likely change in the coming decades in response to higher temperatures and variable precipitation patterns. We characterized the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition from 12 different wetland sites across the USA spanning gradients in climate, landcover, sampling depth, and hydroperiod for comparison to DOM in other inland waters. Using absorption spectroscopy, parallel factor analysis modeling, and ultra-high resolution mass spectroscopy, we identified differences in DOM sourcing and processing by geographic site. Wetland DOM composition was driven primarily by differences in landcover where forested sites contained greater aromatic and oxygenated DOM content compared to grassland/herbaceous sites which were more aliphatic and enriched in N and S molecular formulae. Furthermore, surface and porewater DOM was also influenced by properties such as soil type, organic matter content, and precipitation. Surface water DOM was relatively enriched in oxygenated higher molecular weight formulae representing HUPHigh O/C compounds than porewaters, whose DOM composition suggests abiotic sulfurization from dissolved inorganic sulfide. Finally, we identified a group of persistent molecular formulae (3,489) present across all sites and sampling depths (i.e., the signature of wetland DOM) that are likely important for riverine-to-coastal DOM transport. As anthropogenic disturbances continue to impact temperate wetlands, this study highlights drivers of DOM composition fundamental for understanding how wetland organic carbon will change, and thus its role in biogeochemical cycling. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often the most reactive form of organic carbon in wetlands, but its molecular characteristics and distribution are not well defined across different wetland types. We characterized DOM and analyzed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations across 12 temperate USA wetlands during wet and dry seasons from both surface- and porewaters. Wetland DOM primarily originates from the landscapes with greater DOC concentrations than similar inland waters such as lakes and rivers. DOM composition differs mostly by geographic site, suggesting that forested wetlands contain more aromatic DOM compounds from vegetation and soil than grassland/herbaceous wetlands, which contain DOM that is more processed. DOM composition between surface and porewaters is influenced by local ecological properties such as soil content and precipitation, with porewater compositions heavily impacted by mineral interactions. Finally, we identified common molecular signatures across all wetlands that have also been found in the largest arctic rivers, highlighting the role of wetlands as potential organic carbon sources to rivers and coastal systems. As precipitation and temperature patterns continue to change across temperate regions, the balance between different carbon pools will likely respond, particularly between the distribution and composition of wetland surface and porewater organic matter. Wetlands contain higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and greater aromatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition than other inland waters across the USA Wetland DOM composition differs spatially between forested and grassland/herbaceous landcover as well as between surface and porewaters Persistent molecular formulae are observed across all wetlands that may be important for riverine-to-coastal DOM cycling					; Wickland, Kimberly/AAU-2963-2021; Spencer, Robert/ADE-1993-2022; Bernhardt, Emily/B-4541-2010; Bansal, Sheel/LFV-7491-2024; Poulin, Brett/LTE-5938-2024	McKenna, Amy/0000-0001-7213-521X; Koupaei-Abyazani, Nikaan/0000-0001-6982-230X; Bansal, Sheel/0000-0003-1233-1707; Kurek, Martin/0000-0002-6904-5253; Wickland, Kimberly/0000-0002-6400-0590; Anderson, Steven/0000-0001-5281-0222; 													0886-6236	1944-9224				MAY	2024	38	5							e2023GB007917	10.1029/2023GB007917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GB007917													WOS:001264019800001

In bucolic environments such as natural scenes with low texture and little semantic content, the main challenge is to handle the variations in visual appearance across time such as illumination, weather, vegetation state or viewpoints. The nature of the variations is different and this leads to a different approach to describing a bucolic scene. We introduce a global image description computed from its semantic and topological information. It is built from the wavelet transforms of the image's semantic edges. Matching two images is then equivalent to matching their semantic edge transforms. This method reaches state-of-the-art image retrieval performance on two multi-season environment-monitoring datasets: the CMU-Seasons and the Symphony Lake dataset. It also generalizes to urban scenes on which it is on par with the current baselines NetVLAD and DELF.

J	Teshome, FB				Teshome, Fiseha Bekele			Seasonal water quality index and suitability of the water body to designated uses at the eastern catchment of Lake Hawassa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The availability of quality water is imperative to human health and ecosystem functioning. This study was aimed at determining the water quality index and examining its suitability to different water uses. Water samples were collected in dry and rainy seasons to capture the influence of seasonal variation. Water quality indicators (pH, electric conductivity (EC), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate, phosphate, and ammonia) were analyzed in the laboratory, and weighted arithmetic index method was employed to determine the quality index. The water quality index (WQI) showed higher value 870.3 and 1,313 for dry and rainy seasons which indicates that the water is unfit for human use, and the status of the water body is hypereutrophic. With cautions handling, the water appeared to be suitable for irrigation and livestock production but undesirable for aquatic life and resulted in an impairment of the ecosystem. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in water quality parameters between dry and rainy seasons (p < 0.05). The overall water quality status demonstrated concerns that could pose a significant risk; hence, measures should be taken to improve the quality and manage water to safeguard human health and environmental safety.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2020	27	1			SI		279	290		10.1007/s11356-019-06794-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06794-4								31786763					WOS:000514847300022

The average concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in 22 surface water samples and 14 sediment samples were 90.07 ng/L and 80.65 ng/g dw, respectively. Sixteen types of OCPs, dominated by HCHs, DDTs and heptachlor, were detected in the Dongting Lake. The relationships of OCP residues between Dongting Lake and its tributary rivers have been discussed and the hydraulic connections with the Yangtze River and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) were also considered. Results showed that the shortage of runoff, earlier dry season, and reduction of sediment deposition extremely deteriorated the hydraulic conditions, magnified the water cycle, and restrained the self-purification of OCPs. The n-ary sumation OCPs in surface water were concentrated in the inlets of Yangtze River, Lishui River, Zishui River, Yuanshui River, and Xiangjiang River. Moreover, the n-ary sumation OCPs in the outlet of the Yangtze River also maintained a high level, indicating that OCPs posed adverse effects on the Yangtze River. Risk assessments of OCPs in the surface water of Dongting Lake were estimated according to available water quality guidelines and health risk assessment models. The results indicated that OCPs in the surface water of Dongting Lake were safe for aquatic organisms and human health. In addition, sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) were also applied to evaluate the potential ecotoxicological risks of OCPs in sediments. The results presented that contaminants of gamma-HCH; o,p '-DDD; and dieldrin in sediment had adverse effects on benthic organisms, indicating that fundamental solutions should be proposed to control OCP contamination in Dongting Lake.					李, 召召/X-2378-2019; Lu, Shaoyong/KCX-9784-2024														0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2021	28	24					30841	30857		10.1007/s11356-021-12743-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12743-x		FEB 2021						33594570					WOS:000618606600016
J	Yang, HF; Huang, YJ; Ma, C; Zhang, ZF; Wang, CS				Yang, Hanfei; Huang, Yongjian; Ma, Chao; Zhang, Zhifeng; Wang, Chengshan			Recognition of Milankovitch cycles in XRF core-scanning records of the Late Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation from the Songliao Basin (northeastern China) and their paleoclimate implications	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												Cretaceous terrestrial sedimentary records are crucial for our understanding of geological systems' responses to past climate change under greenhouse condition. Numerous publications have documented that Milankovitch cycles were a dominant climate driver over multi-millennial timescales. However, most of these orbital signals were derived from marine records obtained during the Cenozoic geological period, whereas knowledge of Milankovitch cycles preserved in lacustrine sediments prior to the Cenozoic is limited due to the lack of a precise chronological framework, poor preservation rate of terrestrial sediments, limited records, and fewer experts in this research area. This paper reports high-resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental records of K, Ti, Rb, Sr, Zr, Zr/Rb, Rb/Sr, and K/Ti from Member 1 (k(2)n(1)) and Member 2 (k(2)n(2)) of the Nenjiang Formation, which were obtained from a near-continuous SK-2 East (SK-2e) borehole drilled in the Songliao Basin (SB) of northeastern (NE) China. Variations of the elemental records reveal a humid-arid-humid-semiarid climatic evolution throughout the deposition of k(2)n(1) and a humid-arid-humid-arid climatic variation throughout the deposition of k(2)n(2). In this context, K(2)n(1) experienced a relatively longer humid period and more pronounced climatic fluctuation than K(2)n(2). A method of average spectral misfit (ASM) was adopted to successfully identify two optimal sedimentation rates of 6.577 and 8.369 cm/ka for K(2)n(1) and K(2)n(2), respectively. Based on these two sedimentation rates, nearly all significant Milankovitch cycles preserved in the Rb/Sr record were recognized. It is suggested that westerly wind was the main climatic driving factor of climate evolution in the SB under the forcing of Milankovitch cycles. The collectively regulation of obliquity and precession increased the seasonal contrasts during humid periods in the Nenjiang Formation and thereby amplified the paleomonsoon effect, thus bringing more moisture towards the SB and lead to enhanced rainfall.

As the first high-resolution satellite for earth observation in China, GaoFen-1 (GF-1) has great potential for collecting water depth data. Multispectral images from GF-1 (16 m) combined with water depth data from long-term monitoring at a hydrological station were used with the normalized difference waterbody index, density segmentation, band combination, models (single-band, multi-band, and dual-band ratio) to invert the water depth of East Dongting Lake in the dry season and to provide important references for remote sensing of water depth. The experimental results are as follows. (1) Red, green, blue, and combined bands had higher correlation with the measured data. Consequently, the green band was chosen as the factor in the single-band model; blue, green, and red bands in the multi-band model and the ratio of green to red bands in the dual-band ratio model. (2) The correlation coefficients of measured data and single-, multi, and dual-band models were 0.848, 0.867, and 0.925, respectively. (3) The inversion results showed that average water level in East Dongting Lake was approximately 20 m in the dry season during the period 2013-2016 and it was highest in southern area, intermediate in eastern area, and lowest in the western area.

Perspectives for an integrated understanding of tropical and temperate high-mountain lakes	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY					6th National Congress of Limnology	NOV 11-14, 2014	Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limno, Mexico City, MEXICO		Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limno			High mountain lakes are extreme freshwater ecosystems and excellent sentinels of current global change. They are likely among the most comparable ecosystems across the world. The largest contrast occurs between lakes in temperate and tropical areas. The main difference arises from the seasonal patterns of heat exchange and the external loadings (carbon, phosphorus, metals). The consequence is a water column structure based on temperature, in temperate lakes, and oxygen, in tropical lakes. This essential difference implies that, in tropical lakes, one can expect a more sustained productivity throughout the year; a higher nutrient internal loading based on the mineralization of external organic matter; higher nitrification-denitrification potential related to the oxyclines; and a higher metal mobilization due to the permanently reduced bottom layer. Quantifying and linking these and other biogeochemical pathways to particular groups of organisms is in the current agenda of high-mountain limnology. The intrinsic difficulties of the taxonomic study of many of the organisms inhabiting these systems can be now overcome with the use of molecular techniques. These techniques will not only provide a much less ambiguous taxonomic knowledge of the microscopic world, but also will unveil new biogeochemical pathways that are difficult to measure chemically and will solve biogeographical puzzles of the distribution of some macroscopic organism, tracing the relationship with other areas. Daily variability and vertical gradients in the tropics are the main factors of phytoplankton species turnover in tropical lakes; whereas seasonality is the main driver in temperate communities. The study of phytoplankton in high-mountain lakes only makes sense in an integrated view of the microscopic ecosystem. A large part of the plankton biomass is in heterotrophic, and mixotrophic organisms and prokaryotes compete for dissolved resources with eukaryotic autotrophs. In fact, high-mountain lake systems are excellent model ecosystems for applying an investigation linking airshed to sediments functional views. Additionally, the study of the mountain lakes districts as functional metacommunity units may reveal key differences in the distribution of organisms of limited (slow) dispersal. We propose that limnological studies at tropical and temperate high mountain lakes should adhere to a common general paradigm. In which biogeochemical processes are framed by the airshed-to-sediment continuum concept and the biogeographical processes in the functional lake district concept. The solid understanding of the fundamental limnological processes will facilitate stronger contributions to the assessment of the impacts of the on-going global change in remote areas.

Comparative Analysis of Empirical and Machine Learning Models for Chla Extraction Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat OLI Data: Opportunities, Limitations, and Challenges	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote retrieval of near-surface chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration in small inland waters is challenging due to substantial optical interferences of various water constituents and uncertainties in the atmospheric correction (AC) process. Although various algorithms have been developed to estimate Chla from moderate-resolution terrestrial missions (similar to 10-60 m), the production of both accurate distribution maps and time series of Chla has proven challenging, limiting the use of remote analyses for lake monitoring. Here, we develop a support vector regression (SVR) model, which uses satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance spectra (R-rs(d)) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images as input for Chla retrieval in a representative eutrophic prairie lake, Buffalo Pound Lake (BPL), Saskatchewan, Canada. Validated against in situ Chla from seven ice-free seasons (N 200; 2014-2020), the SVR model outperformed both locally tuned, Rdrs-fed empirical models (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index, 2 and 3-band, and OC3) and Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) by 15-65%, while exhibiting comparable performance to a locally trained MDN, with an error of similar to 35%. Comparison of Chla retrieval models, AC processors (iCOR, ACOLITE), and radiometric products (Rayleigh corrected, surface, and top-of-atmosphere reflectance) showed that the best Chla maps and optimal time series (up to 100 mg m(-3)) were produced using a coupled SVR-iCOR system.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Chegoonian, Amir Masoud/HNT-0012-2023; Pahlevan, Nima/L-7746-2014; Davies, John-Mark/ABK-5960-2022; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Chegoonian, Amir Masoud/0000-0003-0862-2763; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Pahlevan, Nima/0000-0002-5454-5212; 													0703-8992	1712-7971				JAN 2	2023	49	1							2215333	10.1080/07038992.2023.2215333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2023.2215333													WOS:001007628400001

Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (CFpars) have been widely used to evaluate growth scope and photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton. According to our 2-year monthly monitor datasets in Lake Erhai, a simple but convenient method was established to predict Microcystis blooms and algal cell densities based on a CFpar representing maximal photochemical quantum yield of Photosystems II (PSII) of algae. Generalized linear mixed models, used to identify the key factors related to the phytoplankton biomass in Lake Erhai, showed significant correlations between Chl a concentration and both the light attenuation coefficient and water temperature. We fitted seasonal trends of CFpars (F-v/F-m and Delta F/F-m') and algal cell densities into the trigonometric regression to predict their seasonal variations and the autocorrelation function was applied to calculate the time lag between them. We found that the time lag only existed between F-v/F-m from blue channel and algal cell densities even both F-v/F-m and F-v/F-m 0 show the significant non-linear dynamics relationships with algal cell densities. The peak values of total algal cell density, cyanobacteria density and Microcystis density followed the foregoing peak value of F-v/F-m from blue channel with a time lagged around 40 days. Therefore, we could predict the possibilities of Microcystis bloom and estimate the algal cell densities in Lake Erhai ahead of 40 days based on the trends of F-v/F-m values from blue channel. The results from our study implies that the corresponding critical thresholds between F-v/F-m value and bloom occurrence, which might give new insight into prediction of cyanobacteria blooms and provide a convenient and efficient way for establishment of early warning of cyanobacteria bloom in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems.

However, the vertical movement of phytoplankton within the water column can complicate the determination of total phytoplankton biomass using remotely sensed data of surface conditions. In this study, we develop, validate, and apply a new approach to use remotely sensed reflectance to estimate the variability of total algal biomass in shallow eutrophic lakes. Using the baseline normalized difference bloom index together with hydrological and bathymetric data, we determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the total algal biomass in Lake Chaohu, a large shallow lake in eastern China under the nonalgae bloom conditions. Over an eleven-year period (2003-2013), the total phytoplankton biomass was highly variable, more than doubling between 2006 and 2007, from 19.95t to 39.50t. The seasonal decomposition of biomass dynamics indicated the highest biomass production occurred in June, while the lowest occurred in April. The estimates of total phytoplankton biomass were both consistent with in situ measurements and consistent for observations made on the same day and on consecutive days. The improved stability and reliability of total biomass estimations provided more complete information about lake conditions with respect to surface concentrations. This has implications for both management and modeling.

Regardless of the unprecedented anthropogenic disturbances on natural flood regimes, there is limited understanding for the response of fish assemblages to flood pulses. Most studies documented the issue sorely on floodplain rivers or floodplain lakes, but the dynamics of fish communities in the transitional floodplains accounting for both lentic and lotic environments are rarely reported. Here we measure temporal (high and low water seasons) and spatial (lotic and lentic environments) patterns of fish assemblages in the transitional floodplain between the Yangtze River and Lake Caizi using taxonomic and functional group metrics. Our results demonstrated significantly variations in fish community composition among different environments between high and low water seasons. During flooding season in high water phase, we observed significantly patchy population recruitments of riverine fish species. Then in low water season, widespread lake residents dominated the lentic environments due to their higher environment tolerance. Benefitting from the functional group measurement, we identified three flooding related functional groups i. e., G2, G9 and G10 (consisting of riverine catfishes, gudgeons, and loaches), that may bear the brunt of natural flood pulses alterations. Despite the significant variations of richness in taxonomic diversity, we detected higher sensitivity of functional diversity, since three functional diversity indices were significantly higher in high water season. This findings demonstrated important functional recruitments triggered by flood pulses, highlighting a pressing need to sustain natural flood regime with hydrological connectivity for better conservation of fish assemblages in floodplain ecosystem.

To test the effect of widely used space-for-time substitution on lake carbon emissions, this study monitored different pro-cesses of carbon emissions, including the carbon production potential, dissolved carbon concentrations, and carbon release fluxes in eight lakes along the trophic gradients on a spatial scale and the typical eutrophic Lake Taihu for one year on a temporal scale. Eutrophication promoted carbon production potential, dissolved carbon concentrations, and carbon release fluxes, especially for CH4. Trophic lake index (TLI) showed positive corre-lations with the CH4 production potential, dissolved CH4 concentrations, and CH4 release fluxes, and also pos-itive correlations with the CO2 production potential, dissolved CO2 concentrations, and CO2 release fluxes. The space-for-time substitution led to an overestimation for the influence of eutrophication on carbon emissions, especially the further intensification of lake eutrophication. On the spatial scale, the average CH4 production potential, dissolved CH4 concentrations and CH4 release fluxes in eutrophic lakes were 268.6, 0.96 mu mol/L, and 587.6 mu mol m - 2 center dot h- 1,respectively, while they were 215.8, 0.79 mu mol/L, and 548.6 mu mol m - 2 center dot h- 1on the temporal scale. Obviously, CH4 and CO2 emissions on the spatial scale were significantly higher than those on the temporal scale in eutrophic lakes. The primary influencing factors were the seasonal changes in the physicochemical environments of lake water, including dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature. The CH4 and CO2 release fluxes showed negative correlations with DO, while temperature displayed positive correlations, respectively. These results suggest that the effects of DO and temperature on lake carbon emissions should be considered, which may be ignored during the accurate assessment of lake carbon budget via space-for-time substitution in eutrophic lakes.

This study exploits the TWS observation from the new temporal gravity field model, HUST-Grace2016 (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), which is developed by a new low-frequency noise processing strategy. A novel GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) post-processing approach is proposed to enhance the quality of the TWS estimate, and the improved TWS is used to characterize the drought and flood events over the YRB. The HUST-Grace2016-derived TWS presents good agreement with the CSR (Center for Space Research) mascon solution as well as the PCR-GLOBWB (PCRaster Global Water Balance) hydrological model. Particularly, our solution provides remarkable performance in identifying the extreme climate events e.g., flood and drought over the YRB and its sub-basins. The comparison between GRACE-derived TWS variations and the MODIS-derived (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) inundated area variations is then conducted. The analysis demonstrates that the terrestrial reflectance data can provide an alternative way of cross-comparing and validating TWS information in Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and 0.70, respectively. In contrast, the correlation is only 0.10 for Tai Lake, indicating the limitation of cross-comparison between MODIS and GRACE data. In addition, for the first time, the NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research) vertical velocity data is incorporated with GRACE TWS in the exploration of the climate-induced hydrological activities. The good agreement between non-seasonal NCEP/NCAR vertical velocities and non-seasonal GRACE TWSs is found in flood years (2005, 2010, 2012 and 2016) and drought years (2006, 2011 and 2013). The evidence shown in this study may contribute to the analysis of the mechanism of climate impacts on the YRB.

Phytoplankton assemblage composition as an environmental indicator in routine lentic monitoring: Taxonomic versus functional groups	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Phytoplankton community assessment using functional groups is a powerful tool for lake and reservoir biomonitoring, but its efficiency has only been tested in intersite, low-frequency datasets. Here, we took advantage of a gradient of spatially close, but environmentally contrasting, meso-to hypereutrophic reservoirs in Southeast Brazil, to compare the efficiency of morphology-based functional classification (MBFC), phylum-level, and species-level classification for high-frequency, i. e. monthly, biomonitoring. Monitoring of water physical and chemical characteristics revealed the presence of two independent environmental gradients, with the first being related to total phosphorus and suspended solids concentrations, as well as Secchi depth, and the second related to dissolved inorganic nitrogen, water temperature and pH. The species approach had the highest power to explain environmental variation in assemblage structure (21% vs 16% and 17%, in the phylum and MBFC approaches). Although both simplified classifications showed similar explanatory power, MBFC allowed a better differentiation of reservoir assemblages. As the MBFC approach is also the least resource intensive, it may be preferable for routine biomonitoring, or to process large sample numbers. Nonetheless, species-level classification provided the most detailed information on assemblage dynamics and is therefore an important option for scientific studies.					; Gücker, Björn/M-3316-2019; Figueredo, Cleber/GNP-5768-2022; Cupertino, Arthur/AAO-1580-2020; von Rückert, Gabriela/JCN-8772-2023	Santos, Arthur/0000-0002-2196-084X; Figueredo, Cleber/0000-0002-6248-1327; Gucker, Bjorn/0000-0002-0884-8650; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUN	2019	101						522	532		10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.01.054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.01.054													WOS:000470963300053

Smartphones Reveal Angler Behavior: A Case Study of a Popular Mobile Fishing Application in Alberta, Canada	FISHERIES												Successfully managing fisheries and controlling the spread of invasive species depends on the ability to describe and predict angler behavior. However, finite resources restrict conventional survey approaches and tend to produce retrospective data that are limited in time or space and rely on intentions or attitudes rather than actual behavior. In this study, we used three years of angler data from a popular mobile fishing application in Alberta, Canada, to determine province-wide, seasonal patterns of (1) lake popularity that were consistent with conventional data and (2) anthropogenic lake connectivity that has not been widely described in North America. Our proof-of-concept analyses showed that mobile apps can be an inexpensive source of high-resolution, real-time data for managing fisheries and invasive species. We also identified key challenges that underscore the need for further research and development in this new frontier that combines big data with increased stakeholder interaction and cooperation. El manejo exitoso de las pesquerias y el control de la dispersion de especies invasivas depende de la habilidad para describir y predecir el comportamiento de los pescadores.

Currently, they are facing considerable environmental threats that can lead to further degradation. The objective of this study was to investigate comparative spatiotemporal variations of physicochemical properties of four Ethiopian soda lakes in comparison with their historical data. Central (open-water) sampling sites were selected from four Ethiopian soda lakes: Are-nguade, Beseka, Chittu and Shala. Water samples were collected from open sampling stations from January to December 2020 and analyzed at Limnology laboratory of Addis Ababa Univer-sity. The geographical position of each lake was determined by means of Global Positioning System (GPS). All physicochemical factors exhibited significant differences between seasons (ANOVA, P < 0.05), except salinity in Lake Shala. The concentrations of physicochemical pa-rameters were generally high during the dry seasons in the studied lakes due to the low incidence of rainfall, caused by recurrent drought, resulting in higher evapotranspiration rates as they are characterized by a long dry season. Lakes Arenguade and Beseka showed considerable decrease in conductivity, alkalinity and salinity, compared to data from the 1960s and 1990s, which might be attributed to dilution effect. The same parameters show slightly increasing trend in Lake Are-nguade which might be due to high evaporation rate. In general, the physicochemical parameters of the study lakes showed temporal variations, which could be attributed to the dilution effect, evaporation, and hydrological characteristics of the Ethiopian Rift Valley.

Populations of phytoplankton can be controlled by bottom-up factors such as nutrients and temperature or top-down such as predation by zooplankton. Traditionally, taxonomic diversity based on morphologies has been the measure used for analysis of responses to environmental factors. Recently, according to functional groupings, including functional groups (FG), morpho-FG (MFG), and morphology-based FG (MBFG), functional diversity has been used to represent functional aspects of phytoplankton communities. However, to what extent these taxonomic and functional groupings are congruent at seasonal time-scales and the main environmental factors, which drive succession, have remained less studied. Here, we analyzed absolute and relative proportions of a phytoplankton community during a 3-year period in Lake Erhai, a eutrophic highland lake in China. Alpha diversity and beta diversity, as measured by Shannon-Wiener and Bray-Curtis indices of taxonomic grouping and three functional groupings (FG, MFG, and MBFG) were applied to investigate environmental factors determining diversity. Significant, positive relationships were observed between taxonomic diversity and functional diversity that were strongly linked through seasons. In order to exclude the influence of dominant species' tolerance to extreme environments, the dominant species were excluded one by one, and the results showed that residual communities still exhibited similar patterns of succession. This synchronous temporal pattern was not principally driven by the dominant genera (Microcystis, Psephonema, and Mougeotia). Instead, the entire phytoplankton community assemblages were important in the pattern. Most diversity indices of taxonomic and functional groupings were significantly correlated with solar irradiance, but not nutrient concentrations. Because the lake is eutrophic and there were already sufficient nutrients available, additional nutrients had little effect on seasonal taxonomic and functional diversity of phytoplankton in Lake Erhai.

Southward Shift of the Pacific ITCZ During the Holocene	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												The Holocene (0-11.7 ka BP) appears warm and stable in ice core and global temperature reconstructions as well as in transient climate simulations. This seeming quiescence of Earth's climate belies large secular changes in seasonal and zonal mean radiation receipts resulting from variations in orbital precession and obliquity. Here we show that the tropical Pacific, a key mediator of global climate, underwent a profound climatic shift during the Holocene. Hydrogen isotope ratios of the algal lipid dinosterol, isolated from marine lake sediments in Palau, increased by 50 parts per thousand between 7.7 and 4.5 ka BP, indicating a reduction in precipitation. This implied drying coincided with increased rainfall to the southwest of Palau in Borneo, weakened northern hemisphere monsoons, strengthened southern hemisphere monsoons, and an equatorward shift of terrestrial photosynthesis. A southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, forced by insolation, is the most likely cause of these climatic and biospheric changes. Plain Language Summary Rainfall is one of the more difficult climate parameters to reconstruct and, unfortunately, is also poorly represented in mathematical models of climate. The central importance of rainfall to human societies, however, makes it critical that climate models do a better job forecasting precipitation changes. They can be improved by comparing their outputs to past climate states when things like greenhouse gases or solar radiation receipts differed. Toward that end, this study presents a new reconstruction of tropical rainfall spanning the last 10,000 years, the period since the last ice age ended, from a saltwater lake in Palau in the western tropical North Pacific Ocean. It is based on the ratio of heavy and light hydrogen in a lipid from single-celled algae preserved in sediment. A large increase of heavy hydrogen 7,700-4,500 years ago indicates a significant reduction in rainfall. During this same time monsoon systems of Asia and Africa weakened. The likely cause for these changes was a southward shift of the tropical rain bands in response to changes in Earth's orbital geometry. Climate models now have a new constraint on the tropical precipitation response to changes in solar radiation, which can be used to improve forecasts of future rainfall.					; Haberle, Simon/MZQ-3551-2025; Blois, Jessica/G-5893-2011; Atahan, Pia/D-8670-2012	Clark, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9055-655X; Haberle, Simon/0000-0001-5802-6535; Blois, Jessica/0000-0003-4048-177X; 													2572-4517	2572-4525				DEC	2018	33	12					1383	1395		10.1029/2018PA003469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018PA003469													WOS:000455877000004

Sedimentary evolution and environmental history of Lake Van (Turkey) over the past 600 000 years	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The lithostratigraphic framework of Lake Van, eastern Turkey, has been systematically analysed to document the sedimentary evolution and the environmental history of the lake during the past ca 600000years. The lithostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy of a 219 m long drill core from Lake Van serve to separate global climate oscillations from local factors caused by tectonic and volcanic activity. An age model was established based on the climatostratigraphic alignment of chemical and lithological signatures, validated by 40Ar/39Ar ages. The drilled sequence consists of ca 76% lacustrine carbonaceous clayey silt, ca 2% fluvial deposits, ca 17% volcaniclastic deposits and 5% gaps. Six lacustrine lithotypes were separated from the fluvial and event deposits, such as volcaniclastics (ca 300 layers) and graded beds (ca 375 layers), and their depositional environments are documented. These lithotypes are: (i) graded beds frequently intercalated with varved clayey silts reflecting rising lake levels during the terminations; (ii) varved clayey silts reflecting strong seasonality and an intralake oxic-anoxic boundary, for example, lake-level highstands during interglacials/interstadials; (iii) CaCO3-rich banded sediments which are representative of a lowering of the oxic-anoxic boundary, for example, lake level decreases during glacial inceptions; (iv) CaCO3-poor banded and mottled clayey silts reflecting an oxic-anoxic boundary close to the sediment-water interface, for example, lake-level lowstands during glacials/stadials; (v) diatomaceous muds were deposited during the early beginning of the lake as a fresh water system; and (vi) fluvial sands and gravels indicating the initial flooding of the lake basin. The recurrence of lithologies (i) to (iv) follows the past five glacial/interglacial cycles. A 20 m thick disturbed unit reflects an interval of major tectonic activity in Lake Van at ca 414ka bp. Although local environmental processes such as tectonic and volcanic activity influenced sedimentation, the lithostratigraphic pattern and organic matter content clearly reflect past global climate changes, making Lake Van an outstanding terrestrial archive of unprecedented sensitivity for the reconstruction of the regional climate over the last 600000years.

Here we evaluated the Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) product that uses the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar technique to measure seasonal surface subsidence and infer ALT around Barrow, Alaska. We compared ReSALT with ground-based ALT obtained using probing and calibrated, 500 MHz Ground Penetrating Radar at multiple sites around Barrow. ReSALT accurately reproduced observed ALT within uncertainty of the GPR and probing data in ~76% of the study area. However, ReSALT was less than observed ALT in ~22% of the study area with well-drained soils and in ~1% of the area where soils contained gravel. ReSALT was greater than observed ALT in some drained thermokarst lake basins representing ~1% of the area. These results indicate remote sensing techniques based on InSAR could be an effective way to measure and monitor ALT over large areas on the Arctic coastal plain.					; Jafarov, Elchin/G-1616-2016; ZHANG, TINGJUN/AAX-3662-2020; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/G-1616-2016; Liu, Lin/Q-4237-2018; Panda, Santosh/I-2477-2014	Parsekian, Andrew/0000-0001-5072-9818; ZHANG, Tingjun/0000-0001-6974-9501; zebker, howard/0000-0001-9931-5237; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/0000-0002-8310-3261; Liu, Lin/0000-0002-9581-1337; Gusmeroli, Alessio/0000-0002-8355-5591; Panda, Santosh/0000-0003-1990-9479														2072-4292				APR	2015	7	4					3735	3759		10.3390/rs70403735	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs70403735													WOS:000354789300016

Structure, inter-annual recurrence, and global-scale connectivity of airborne microbial communities	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dust coming from the large deserts on Earth, such as the Sahara, can travel long distances and be dispersed over thousands of square kilometers. Remote dust deposition rates are increasing as a consequence of global change and may represent a mechanism for intercontinental microbial dispersal. Remote oligotrophic alpine lakes are particularly sensitive to dust inputs and can serve as sentinels of airborne microbial transport and the ecological consequences of accelerated intercontinental microbial migration. In this study, we applied high-throughput sequencing techniques (16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing) to characterize the microbial communities of atmospheric deposition collected in the Central Pyrenees (NE Spain) along three years. Additionally, bacteria from soils in Mauritania and from the air-water interface of high altitude Pyrenean lakes were also examined. Communities in aerosol deposition varied in time with a strong seasonal component of interannual similarity. Communities from the same season tended to resemble more each other than those from different seasons. Samples from disparate dates, in turn, slightly tended to have more dissimilar microbial assemblages (i.e., temporal distance decay), overall suggesting that atmospheric deposition may influence sink habitats in a temporally predictable manner. The three habitats examined (soil, deposition, and air-water interface) harbored distinct microbial communities, although airborne samples collected in the Pyrenees during Saharan dust outbreaks were closer to Mauritian soil samples than those collected during no Saharan dust episodes. The three habitats shared c.a. 1.4% of the total number of microbial sequences in the dataset Such successful immigrants were spread in different bacterial classes. Overall, this study suggests that local and regional features may generate global trends in the dynamics and distribution of airborne microbial assemblages, and that the diversity of viable cells in the high atmosphere is likely higher than previously expected.

Identification of the nature and relative contribution of sediment sources in rivers is important to mitigate water erosion within catchments and siltation problems in lakes and reservoirs. We estimated the relative contribution of land uses (i.e. sources) to suspended and streambed sediments in the Chitlang catchment using stable carbon isotope signature (delta C-13) of long-chain fatty acids as a tracer input for MixSIAR, a Bayesian mixing model used to apportion sediment sources. Our findings reveal that the relative contribution of land uses varied between suspended and streambed sediment, but did not change over the monsoon period. Significant over-or under-prediction of source contributions could occur due to overlapping source tracer values, if source groups are classified on a catchment-wide basis. Therefore, we applied a novel deconvolutional framework of MixSIAR (D-MixSIAR) to improve source apportionment of suspended sediment collected at tributary confluences (i.e. sub-catchment level) and at the outlet of the entire catchment. The results indicated that the mixed forest was the dominant (41 +/- 13%) contributor of sediment followed by broadleaf forest (15 +/- 8%) at the catchment outlet during the prewet season, suggesting that forest disturbance as well as high rainfall and steep slopes interact for high sediment generation within the study catchment. Unpaved rural road tracks located on flat and steep slopes (11 +/- 8 and 9 +/- 7% respectively) almost equally contributed to the sediment. Importantly, agricultural terraces (upland and lowland) had minimal contribution (each <7%) confirming that proper terrace management and traditional irrigation systems played an important role in mitigating sediment generation and delivery. Source contributions had a small temporal, but large spatial, variation in the sediment cascade of Chitlang stream. D-MixSIAR provided significant improvement regarding spatially explicit sediment source apportionment within the entire catchment system. This information is essential to prioritize implementation measures to control erosion in community managed forests to reduce sediment loadings to Kulekhani hydropower reservoir. In conclusion, using compound-specific stable isotope (CSSI) tracers for sediment fingerprinting in combination with a deconvolutional Bayesian mixing model offers a versatile approach to deal with the large tracer variability within catchment land uses and thus to successfully apportion multiple sediment sources.

Rapid Formation of Clathrate Hydrate From Liquid Ethane and Water Ice on Titan	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Liquid ethane is present in the lakes and seas observed on Titan's surface by the Cassini-Huygens mission. While interaction between liquid hydrocarbons and water ice is expected to result in the formation of clathrate hydrates, such reaction (and its kinetics) has not yet been demonstrated for cryogenic liquids under relevant planetary conditions. In this paper, we report the first experimental evidence for rapid formation of clathrates upon direct contact of liquid ethane with water ice at 1 bar using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Kinetics experiments conducted in the temperature range 150-173 K yield an activation energy of 14.8 +/- 2.2 kJ/mol, which is suggestive of a diffusion-controlled mechanism for clathrate formation. This implies that a clathrate reservoir can form within seasonal time scales on Titan if liquid ethane comes into contact with a pre-existing icy bedrock, which may hold important implications for the structure and dynamics of Titan's crust and its global evolution. Plain Language Summary Saturn's moon Titan has a dense atmosphere and liquid lakes (of methane and ethane) on its surface. These organic compounds are the main constituents of natural gas on Earth. Water is completely frozen and comprises most of Titan's bedrock materials. Under the right conditions, it is common for water ice to form new solids that trap natural gas in their structures, called clathrate hydrates. On Earth, clathrate hydrates are often found in the permafrost and deep ocean. However, Titan is so much colder that these natural gases exist as liquids. We do not yet know if clathrates can form under such conditions, and if so, how quickly. In this study, we prepared small grains of water ice, bathed them in liquid ethane, and monitored the rate at which clathrate hydrates appear. Our data confirm that clathrates would indeed form on Titan from an ethane lake or rain event onto water ice, and they would do so very quickly (in just a few Earth years). This suggests that clathrate hydrates can be an important material on Titan that may be encountered by future missions there.					; Muñoz-Iglesias, Victoria/AAA-5658-2021; Vu, Tuan/F-5223-2017; Munoz-Iglesias, Victoria/O-1880-2018; Choukroun, Mathieu/F-3146-2017	Maynard-Casely, Helen/0000-0001-6364-9665; Munoz-Iglesias, Victoria/0000-0002-1159-9093; Sotin, Christophe/0000-0003-3947-1072													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 28	2020	47	4							e2019GL086265	10.1029/2019GL086265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL086265													WOS:000529120100016

Assessing factors driving the distribution and characteristics of shoreline macroplastics in a subtropical reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Plastic pollution is a growing problem that threatens all habitat types globally. However, relatively little is known about the extent of macroplastics in African freshwater ecosystems. This study explored the distribution and concentration of different macroplastic debris types in Nandoni reservoir, South Africa over four sites ( 2 high household- and 2 low household-density) and two seasons (cool-dry, hot-dry). Similarities were observed for macroplastic debris numbers and weights across sites and seasons. Although slight insignificant differences in macroplastics abundances were observed, no significant relationships were recorded between household density (i.e. as proxy for human population density) and macroplastic debris abundances. The amount of plastic debris and 'species' (i.e. gamma-diversity value) decreased with distance from the shoreline, with the highest amount of plastic debris and 'species' being observed at the shoreline in all sites and seasons. Polypropylene was the most dominant (>45%) in terms of abundance for both seasons and sites. The information derived serves as a baseline for future studies on macroplastic distributions along freshwater reservoir shorelines. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluating spatio-temporal soil erosion dynamics in the Winam Gulf catchment, Kenya for enhanced decision making in the land-lake interface	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Soil erosion accelerated by poor agricultural practices, land degradation, deprived infrastructure development and other anthropogenic activities has important implications for nutrient cycling, land and lake productivity, loss of livelihoods and ecosystem services, as well as socioeconomic disruption. Enhanced knowledge of dynamic factors influencing soil erosion is critical for policymakers engaged in land use decision-making. This study presents the first spatio-temporal assessment of soil erasion risk modelling in the Winam Gulf, Kenya using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) within a geospatial framework at a monthly resolution between January 2017 and June 2020. Dynamic rainfall emsivity and land cover management factors were derived from existing datasets to determine their effect on average monthly soil kiss by water erosion. By assessing soil erasion rates with enhanced temporal resolution, it is possible to provide greater knowledge regarding months that are particularly susceptible to soil erosion and can better inform future strategies for targeted mitigation measures. Whilst the pseudo monthly average soil loss was calculated (0.80 t ha(-1) month(-1)), the application of this value would lead to misrepresentation of monthly soil loss throughout the year. Our results indicate that the highest erosion rates occur between February and April (average 0.95 t ha(-1) month(-1)). In contrast, between May and August, there is a significantly reduced risk (average 0.72 t ha(-1) month(-1)) due to the low rainfall erosivity and increased vegetation cover as a result of the long rainy season. The mean annual gross soil loss by water erosion in the Winam Gulf catchment amounts to 10.71 Mt year with a mean soil loss rate of 9.63 t ha(-1) year(-1). These findings highlight the need to consider dynamic factors within the RUSLE model and can prove vital for identifying areas of high erosion risk for future targeted investigation and conservation action.					; Dowell, Sophia/KAL-6579-2024; Humphrey, Olivier/AFU-6782-2022; OSANO, ODIPO/LFT-7278-2024	Blake, William/0000-0001-9447-1361; OSANO, ODIPO/0000-0001-9542-9798; Humphrey, Olivier S/0000-0001-7776-7048													0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 1	2022	815								151975	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151975								34843789					WOS:000767234500006

In each year, stochastic-dynamic models fitted to time series of log-transformed phycocyanin concentration revealed two alternative stable states and random factors that were much larger than the difference between the alternate stable states. Transitions between low and high states were abrupt and apparently driven by stochasticity. Variation in annual magnitudes of the alternate states and the stochastic factors were not correlated with annual phosphorus input to the lake. At daily time scales, however, phycocyanin concentration was correlated with phosphorus input, precipitation, and wind velocity for time lags of 1-15 d. Multiple years of high-frequency data were needed to discern these patterns in the noise-dominated dynamics of Cyanobacteria.					; Scheffer, Marten/A-8742-2013; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020; van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020	Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121; Hanson, Paul/0000-0001-8533-6061; 														2378-2242				OCT	2020	5	5					331	336		10.1002/lol2.10152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10152		FEB 2020											WOS:000517905000001

For this purpose, we used a set of daily meteorological data, collected from January 1, 1976, to December 31, 2014. Daily ET0 values were estimated by the FAO's Penman-Monteith equation (ET0PM). The main statistical tests used were the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, the Sen test to detect the magnitude of the trend, and the Pettitt test to detect the start of the trend. For all tests, statistical significance was 5% and/or 1%. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also applied to identify significant differences between the mean interdecadal values for each season. The results showed a significant decreasing trend for ET0 in both Juazeiro (alpha = 5%) and Petrolina (alpha = 1%), with declines of 14.5 mm/year (Juazeiro) and 7.7 mm/year (Petrolina) and that this trend started in 1996. Probably, the ET0 decrease was associated with the increase in the irrigated agricultural areas, and the lake formed upstream from the areas by the construction of Sobradinho Dam.

Because it is likely that Cahokia's decline was precipitated by multiple factors, some environmental and some societal, a robust understanding of this phenomenon will require multiple lines of evidence along with a refined chronology. Here, we use fecal stanol data from Horseshoe Lake, Illinois, as a population proxy for Cahokia and the broader Horseshoe Lake watershed. We directly compare the fecal stanol data with oxygen stable-isotope and paleoenvironmental data from the same sediment cores to evaluate the role of flooding, drought, and environmental degradation in Cahokia's demographic decline and sociopolitical reorganization. We find that Mississippi River flooding and warm season droughts detrimental to agriculture occurred circa (ca.) 1150 CE and possibly generated significant stress for Cahokia's inhabitants. Our findings implicate climate change during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly to Little Ice Age transition as an important component of population and sociopolitical transformations at Cahokia, and demonstrate how climate transitions can simultaneously influence multiple environmental processes to produce significant challenges to society.

While bacteria are regarded as primary mineralizers in the pelagic zone of lakes and oceans, fungi dominate OM decomposition in streams and wetlands. Recent findings indicate that fungal communities are also active in lakes, but little is known about their diversity and interactions with bacteria. Therefore, the decomposer niche overlap of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria was studied on pollen (as a seasonally recurring source of fine particulate OM) by performing microcosm experiments with three different lake types. Special emphasis was placed on analysis of fungal community composition and diversity. We hypothesized that (I) pollen select for small saprotrophic fungi and at the same time for typical particle-associated bacteria; (II) fungal communities form specific free-living and attached sub-communities in each lake type; (III) the ratio between fungi or bacteria on pollen is controlled by the lake's chemistry. Bacteria-to-fungi ratios were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and bacterial and fungal diversity were studied by clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints. A protease assay was used to identify functional differences between treatments. For generalization, systematic differences in bacteria-to-fungi ratios were analyzed with a dataset from the nearby Baltic Sea rivers. High abundances of Chytridiomycota as well as occurrences of Cryptomycota and yeast-like fungi confirm the decomposer niche overlap of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria on pollen. As hypothesized, microbial communities consistently differed between the lake types and exhibited functional differences. Bacteria-to-fungi ratios correlated well with parameters such as organic carbon and pH. The importance of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen for bacteria-to-fungi ratios was supported by the Baltic Sea river dataset. Our findings highlight the fact that carbon-to-nitrogen ratios may also control fungal contributions to OM decomposition in aquatic ecosystems.					; Rösel, Stefan/D-4251-2009; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Rychla, Anna/0000-0002-3942-6047; 													1932-6203					APR 14	2014	9	4							e94643	10.1371/journal.pone.0094643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094643								24732324					WOS:000336970400062

ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY												Global warming is a major threat to the natural environment worldwide with potential adverse impact on plankton community. This will ultimately lead to a change in the dynamics of aquatic food webs. In this study we used seasonally forced multi-species version of the classic Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model to understand the role and stochastic influence of increasing temperature on marine plankton. First, stable coexistence of four phytoplankton and three zooplankton species was created in a system and then the level of temperature changed to achieve our research goal. We found that the stable coexistence of phytoplankton and zooplankton was related to periodic shifts in species biomass, variation in inter-specific competition and niche configuration. Warming significantly reduced total plankton biomass and changed turnover time of a species, with gradual warming breaking the stable coexistence of phytoplankton and zooplankton. In addition, we found that warming make specialist species more vulnerable than generalist species. After adding noise, a significant variation was observed in plankton biomass and amplification of noise was higher for phytoplankton compared to zooplankton. These results suggest that stochastic or unpredictable nature of temperature fluctuations may create a window of opportunity for the emergence of new species. Overall, warming would induce a shift in plankton dynamics and thereby exert pressure on plankton dependent communities such as fish in the long run.					; Alamgir, Kabir/ABA-2963-2020; Hossain, M/D-9765-2016	Sarker, Subrata/0000-0001-9672-1889; 													1476-945X	1476-9840				AUG	2020	43								100857	10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100857	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100857													WOS:000566489300016

In the absence of sufficient data, the relative impacts of human activity and climate change on the lakes shrinking remain as yet undetermined. In this study, the seasonal changes in the lakes water surfaces and area of irrigated lands at the Bakhtegan Basin during the past 37 years were obtained by analyzing 254 satellite images. The calculated drought indexes revealed that both rainfall and river discharge have experienced the most severe droughts since 2008. The applied Mann-Kendall test shown a general warming with a slope of 0.46 degrees C/decade in the basin, as well as decreasing trends in rainfall, river discharge, groundwater levels and stored water in dam reservoirs. During the 1987-1998, the area of irrigated lands has increased from 1253 to 2506 km(2) throughout the basin. By beginning of drought in 2008 until 2017, whereas a major reduction (about 580 km(2)) in irrigated lands was detected in plains located at downstream part of the basin, a significant expansion (about 290 km(2)) of agricultural lands was observed at the upstream plains, where the lands were mainly cultivated with the rice. Based on a provided hydrologic water balance, it was concluded that the agriculture expansion in the upstream part of basin was a major factor in the lakes shrinking and consequently, the hypothesis ascribing climate change and dam construction as the only responsible was rejected.

More specifically, this work is comprised of: (i) analysis of Chl-a and trophic dynamics; (ii) characterization of CDOM; (iii) estimation of Chl-a and CDOM from OLI/Landsat-8 and RapidEye imagery. The monitoring lasted 20 months within a multi-year drought, which contributed to water-quality deterioration. Chl-a and trophic state analysis showed a highly eutrophic status for the perennial reservoir during the entire study period, while the non-perennial reservoirs ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic, with changes associated with the first events of the rainy season. CDOM characterization suggests that the perennial reservoir is mostly influenced by autochthonous sources, while allochthonous sources dominate the non-perennial ones. Spectral-group classification assigned the perennial reservoir as a CDOM-moderate and highly eutrophic reservoir, whereas the non-perennial ones were assigned as CDOM-rich and oligotrophic-dystrophic reservoirs. The remote sensing initiative was partially successful: the Chl-a was best modelled using RapidEye for the perennial one; whereas CDOM performed best with Landsat-8 for non-perennial reservoirs. This investigation showed potential for retrieving water quality parameters in dry areas with small reservoirs.					de Araújo, José/J-9629-2012; Heim, Birgit/B-2815-2017; Foerster, Saskia/D-3881-2011; de Araujo, Jose Carlos/J-9629-2012; Brosinsky, Arlena/K-3984-2019	Heim, Birgit/0000-0003-2614-9391; Foerster, Saskia/0000-0001-7752-7394; de Araujo, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-2649-151X; 													2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							913	10.3390/w9120913	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9120913													WOS:000419225500008

The main objective is to illustrate and discuss quantitative and qualitative aspects of these networks with selected actors who are linked (directly or indirectly) with the agritourism sector through personal in-depth and semi-structured interviews. The quantitative aspects include: quantity of links, spatial extent of networks, type of relationship, its "thickness", the duration of the relationship, issues of seasonality as well as satisfaction of the cooperation. The qualitative aspects include the type of relationship of the actors over the link and who (if anyone) has "control" over this relationship. The main findings indicate that the examined networks are partially affected by the geographic characteristics of the case studies and they are very similar in terms of absolute numbers and network metrics. Although research on networks has been an emerging and promising approach, qualitative characteristics of informal networks seem to be integral for understanding networks and planning tourism policies.

They are known to reduce the velocity of water bodies, thereby serving as suitable breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Their obstruction to water transportation also means students who cross invaded water bodies to school will have their education negatively affected. Based on cross- sectional research with 305 respondents who were sampled using snowballing sampling procedure, this study assesses the effects of water hyacinth invasion on the health of the communities, and the education of children along River Tano and Abby- Tano Lagoon in Ghana. We found that water hyacinth invasion in the two water bodies was associated with malaria infestation. The blockade created also meant students delayed in their quest to access their schools. However, respondents mainly used insecticide- treated nets to cope with the spread of the mosquitoes that bred in the water hyacinth while parents made provision for their wards to stay outside the affected village across the River Tano in order to attend classes in the peak season of the invasion. We recommend that further studies should target only those people whose children cross River Tano to attend school in the Adusuazo community and increase their sample size. This will help gather detailed information on the effects of the invasion on the education of children. We also recommend that further studies should be conducted to provide more concrete data on the categories of respondents whose health are more affected by the invasion and their adaptive strategies.					; Segbefia, Alex/JKH-6640-2023; Honlah, Emmanuel/U-7362-2019	Segbefia, Alexander/0000-0002-3156-3549; Honlah, Emmanuel/0000-0001-9267-2979													2331-1886					MAY 17	2019	5	1							1619652	10.1080/23311886.2019.1619652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2019.1619652													WOS:000476887100001
J	Zhu, KX; Bi, YH; Hu, ZY				Zhu, Kongxian; Bi, Yonghong; Hu, Zhengyu			Responses of phytoplankton functional groups to the hydrologic regime in the Daning River, a tributary of Three Gorges Reservoir, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Daning River is a deep tributary of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China, with water level fluctuations of 30 m annually. It was assumed that the hydrologic regime would be the main driving force in the self-assembling of the phytoplankton community in the river. In order to test this hypothesis, limnological study was performed monthly in the estuary, midstream and upstream of this tributary from May 2008 to April 2009. We identified 17 phytoplankton functional groups among 63 genera. These phytoplankton functional groups varied significantly, both seasonally and longitudinally. During the flood season (March-September), low water level and high inflows caused a marked increase in the turbidity, especially in the estuary and upstream, allowing functional group MP (the meroplanktonic diatoms) to dominate the phytoplankton community. Meanwhile, constant water level and high temperature led to the stability and thermal stratification in the midstream. These conditions resulted in a high phytoplankton biomass and the dominance of phytoplankton functional groups Y (Cryptomonas spp.) and Lo (motile Peridiniopsis niei and Peridinium) that were adapted to water stratification. During the dry season (October-February), although the inflows were low and water retention time was long, the thermal stratification was disrupted by the disturbance due to the impoundment of TGR, and the water column was deeply mixed. The phytoplankton biomass reduced and functional groups changed: group Lo declined, and group C (small diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana) increased in the estuary and midstream. Group Y replaced group MP to dominate the phytoplankton community in the upstream with the water becoming clear and stagnant. It could be deduced that the dynamics of phytoplankton in the Daning River were mainly influenced by hydrologic regime. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, in freshwater environments many investigations have been directed to the study of pelagic microalgae ("phytoplankton") and periphyton (i.e., photosynthetic and mixotrophic protists) through the use of light microscopy (LM). While the number of studies on bacterioplankton communities have shown a substantial increase after the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches, the study of the composition, structure, and spatio-temporal patterns of microbial eukaryotes in freshwater environments was much less widespread. Moreover, the understanding of the correspondence between the relative phytoplankton abundances estimated by HTS and LM is still incomplete. Taking into account these limitations, this study examined the biodiversity and seasonality of the community of eukaryotic microplankton in the epilimnetic layer of a large and deep perialpine lake (Lake Garda) using HTS. The analyses were carried out at monthly frequency during 2014 and 2015. The results highlighted the existence of a rich and well diversified community and the presence of numerous phytoplankton taxa that were never identified by LM in previous investigations. Furthermore, the relative abundances of phytoplankton estimated by HTS and LM showed a significant relationship at different taxonomic ranks. In the 2 years of investigation, the temporal development of the whole micro-eukaryotic community showed a clear non-random and comparable distribution pattern, with the main taxonomic groups coherently distributed in the individual seasons. In perspective, the results obtained in this study highlight the importance of HTS approaches in assessing biodiversity and the relative importance of the main protist groups along environmental gradients, including those caused by anthropogenic impacts (e.g., eutrophication and climate change).					; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015; Boscaini, Alberto/I-7538-2019	Pindo, Massimo/0000-0002-8516-9010; 													1664-302X					MAY 7	2020	11								789	10.3389/fmicb.2020.00789	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00789								32457713					WOS:000536063600001

However, water cycle mechanisms in the Poyang Lake Basin remain poorly understood. In this study, stable isotopes (delta D and delta O-18) of water samples (taken in April, July, and November 2013) and hydrological data are used to investigate the interactions between precipitation, river water, lake water, and shallow groundwater in the Poyang Lake region. The isotopic results show seasonal variations in precipitation, surface water, and groundwater, which provides a set of tools to identify waters that have different histories. The similar isotopic compositions of river water and groundwater suggest a close hydrological connection. Hydrological data present a positive correlation between river runoff and precipitation; however, isotopic results show that rivers in the Poyang Lake Basin in different seasons are primarily recharged by subsurface run-off with different proportion between base flow and near-surface quick flow, rather than by surface run-off directly formed by concurrent rainfall. Due to the geological characteristics of stratum in the Poyang Lake Basin, it is easier for precipitation to infiltrate into soil and recharge groundwater than to form direct surface flow that feeds rivers. The groundwater system is like a huge reservoir which can effectively impound rainfall water, playing an important role in restraining floodwater during the flood season and in ensuring river run-off supply during the dry season.					; Li, Ling/E-5632-2010; Zhan, Lucheng/HZH-3995-2023; Wang, Tao/LNV-2015-2024	Lucheng, Zhan/0000-0001-7389-6002; Li, Ling/0000-0001-8725-1221; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2016	75	19							1307	10.1007/s12665-016-6081-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6081-8													WOS:000385135100008

Eukaryotic plankton are im-portant to the water quality stability in the MRP, but little has been reported about their dynamics and assembly pro-cesses, especially for abundant and rare communities. In this study, amplicon sequencing was used to investigate the eukaryotic plankton communities. The results revealed both abundant and rare communities exhibited similar distance-decay patterns, but abundant communities were particularly subject to environmental heterogeneity and played an important role in determining seasonal differences in eukaryotic plankton communities and alpha diversity. In the MRP, with its strong hydrodynamic exchange, abundant and rare communities were mainly affected by stochas-tic processes, especially homogenizing dispersal. In addition, abundant communities were subject to moderate variable selection (25 %) and rare communities were affected by a higher proportion of dispersal limitation (27 % vs. 10 %). The variation in water temperature and water velocity led to a shift from a stochastic to a deterministic pro-cess dominating the assembly of abundant communities. This study extends insights into the dynamics and assembly processes of abundant and rare eukaryotic plankton communities in the large, engineered drinking water diversion project, which is also useful for the management and regulation of the MRP.

To quantify the contribution of Arctic lakes to the global carbon cycle, we developed a one-dimensional process-based Arctic Lake Biogeochemistry Model (ALBM) that explicitly simulates the dynamics of organic and inorganic carbon in Arctic lakes. By realistically modeling water mixing, carbon biogeochemistry, and permafrost carbon loading, the model can reproduce the seasonal variability of CO2 fluxes from the study Arctic lakes. The simulated area-weighted CO2 fluxes from yedoma thermokarst lakes, nonyedoma thermokarst lakes, and glacial lakes are 29.5, 13.0, and 21.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, close to the observed values (31.2, 17.2, and 16.57.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The simulations show that the high CO2 fluxes from yedoma thermokarst lakes are stimulated by the biomineralization of mobilized labile organic carbon from thawing yedoma permafrost. The simulations also imply that the relative contribution of glacial lakes to the global carbon cycle could be the largest because of their much larger surface area and high biomineralization and carbon loading. According to the model, sunlight-induced organic carbon degradation is more important for shallow nonyedoma thermokarst lakes but its overall contribution to the global carbon cycle could be limited. Overall, the ALBM can simulate the whole-lake carbon balance of Arctic lakes, a difficult task for field and laboratory experiments and other biogeochemistry models. Plain Language Summary Few lake biogeochemistry models are developed specifically for Arctic lakes which are found to be important in understanding the global carbon cycle. In this study, we developed a one-dimensional process-based lake biogeochemistry model that explicitly simulates the dynamics of organic and inorganic carbon in Arctic lakes. By realistically modeling water mixing, carbon biogeochemistry, and permafrost carbon loading, the model can reproduce the seasonal variability of CO2 fluxes from the study Arctic lakes. The simulations show that for the global carbon cycle the relative contribution of glacial lakes could be the largest because of their much larger surface area and high carbon oxidation and loading, and the overall contribution of sunlight-induced organic carbon oxidation is limited due to the limitation of UV energy. Importantly, this lake model can simulate the whole-lake carbon balance of Arctic lakes, a difficult task for field and laboratory experiments and other biogeochemistry models.					; Shurpali, Narasinha/K-5794-2013; Zhuang, Qianlai/A-5670-2009; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Marushchak, Maija/G-1444-2011; Tan, Zeli/G-7792-2018; Biasi, Christina/E-1130-2013	Marushchak, Maija E./0000-0002-2308-5049; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Shurpali, Narasinha/0000-0003-1052-4396; Biasi, Christina/0000-0002-7413-3354; Tan, Zeli/0000-0001-5958-2584													1942-2466					SEP	2017	9	5					2190	2213		10.1002/2017MS001028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017MS001028													WOS:000413487500011

One group of ponds with sediment improver application were referred to as SAPs, and the other group receiving no sediment improver were as NSPs. During the farming season, both the SAPs and NSPs acted as CO2 sinks and CH4 sources. The cumulative CO2-C fluxes from the SAPs and NSPs were -26.78 and -23.49 g m(-2), respectively, and the cumulative CH4-C emissions from the SAPs and NSPs were 0.24 and 0.28 g m(-2), respectively. CO2 fluxes were significantly related to net primary production and water pH, and CH4 fluxes were mainly regulated by water temperature during the farming season. The application of the oxidation-based sediment improver had a positive effect on reducing the CH4 emissions across the water-air interface but had no effect on CO2 fluxes. The sediment improver reduced the organic matter contents and improved the sediment pH and redox potential, which may have facilitated a decrease in CH4 production in the sediment. The CO2 produced through the oxidation of organic material in the sediment may have been absorbed by strong photosynthesis, resulting in a nonsignificant difference in CO2 fluxes between the SAPs and NSPs. The results indicated that the application of sediment improvers in coastal polyculture ponds can reduce carbon emissions, especially CH4 emissions, during the farming period and could help mitigate global warming with regard to the sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP) and sustained-flux global cooling potential (SGCP) models over a 20-year time horizon. Future studies on the CO2 and CH4 production rates of the sediment and the related microbial community could improve our understanding of the effect mechanism of the application of sediment improvers on CO2 and CH4 emissions from mariculture ponds.

The objective of this study was to investigate the concentration of trace metals in atmospheric and lake water samples during the rainy season (before and after precipitation) between November and December 2015. Typical methods of sample preparation for trace metal determination such as cloud point extraction, solid phase extraction and dispersive liquid liquid micro -extraction are time-consuming and difficult to perform; therefore, there is a crucial need for development of more effective sample preparation procedure. A convection microwave assisted digestion procedure for extraction of trace metals was developed for use prior to inductively couple plasma -mass spectrometric determination. The result showed that metals like zinc (133.50-419.30 g/m(3)) and aluminum (53.58-378.93 ug/m3) had higher concentrations in atmospheric samples as compared to lake samples before precipitation. On the other hand, the concentrations of zinc, aluminum, chromium and arsenic were significantly higher in lake samples after precipitation and lower in atmospheric samples. The relationship between physicochemical parameters (pH and turbidity) and heavy metal concentrations was investigated as well. Furthermore, enrichment factor analysis indicated that anthropogenic sources such as soil dust, biomass buming.and fuel combustion influenced the metal concentrations in the atmosphere.

An expansion of depth-integrated monitoring programs has provided insight into the importance of organic carbon processing that occurs below the upper mixed layer. However, the chemical and physical drivers of metabolism and metabolic coupling remain unresolved, especially in the metalimnion. In this depth zone, sharp gradients in key resources such as light and temperature co-occur with dynamic physical conditions that influence metabolic processes directly and simultaneously hamper the accurate tracing of biological activity. We evaluated the drivers of metalimnetic metabolism and its associated uncertainty across 10 stratified lakes in Europe and North America. We hypothesized that the metalimnion would contribute highly to whole-lake functioning in clear oligotrophic lakes, and that metabolic rates would be highly variable in unstable polymictic lakes. Depth-integrated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from diel dissolved oxygen curves using a Bayesian approach. Metabolic estimates were more uncertain below the epilimnion, but uncertainty was not consistently related to lake morphology or mixing regime. Metalimnetic rates exhibited high day-to-day variability in all trophic states, with the metalimnetic contribution to daily whole-lake GPP and ER ranging from 0% to 87% and < 1% to 92%, respectively. Nonetheless, the metalimnion of low-nutrient lakes contributed strongly to whole-lake metabolism on average, driven by a collinear combination of highlight, low surface-water phosphorous concentration and high metalimnetic volume. Consequently, a single-sensor approach does not necessarily reflect whole-ecosystem carbon dynamics in stratified lakes.

Accurately, quickly and effectively monitoring soil salinity is critical for governmental institutions that develop hazard prevention and mitigation strategies. Remote sensing (RS) technology provides a viable alternative to traditional field work due to its large area coverage, abundant spectral information and nearly constant observations. Key issues in RS-based soil salinity monitoring include the lack of both data-mining techniques for obtaining spectral band information and comprehensive considerations of synergies among different spectra. The main objective of this study was to provide in-depth explorations of data mining and integration algorithms from different satellites to multidimensionally evaluate soil salinity models. The Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve (Xinjiang Province, China) was selected as a case study. First, ground-measured visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectral data were combined with the RS band to simulate Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel 2 (S2) and 3 (S3) data. Second, one-dimensional RS bands and 15 soil salinity and vegetation indices were selected, and 15 spectral data transformations (reciprocal, differential, absorbance, etc.) were obtained. Two- and three-dimensional spectral indices were constructed, and the response relationships between different spectral indices and soil electrical conductivity (FE) were comprehensively explored. Finally, an integrated multidimensional algorithm was used to estimate soil salinity in high-performance models for the three satellites. The results showed that all data-mining-based model combinations performed well fora!! satellites (R-2 > 0.80). However, with multidimensional model combinations, S3 presented the highest predictive capability (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 2.57 mS.cm(-1), RPD = 2.05), followed by S2 (R-2 = 0.86, RMSF. = 2.71 mS.cm(-1), RPD = 1.90) and 1.8 (R-2 = 0.85, RMSF. = 2.84 mS.cm(-1), RPD = 1.87). Therefore, data mining with integration algorithms in model combinations performs significantly better than previous models and could be considered a promising method for obtaining improved results from soil salinity susceptibility models in similar cases.

Tracking domestic wastewater and road de-icing salt in a municipal drinking water reservoir: Acesulfame and chloride as co-tracers	WATER RESEARCH												Developing strategies to identify the origins of contaminants in watersheds is crucial for source water protection. The use of multiple tracers improves the ability to identify contamination events originating from various land use activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of acesulfame and chloride as co-tracers to represent the impact of pollution originating from wastewater and road de-icing on water quality in a municipal drinking water source. The study included a two-year sampling and water quality analysis program in numerous locations within a drinking water reservoir comprising a lake (upstream) and a river (downstream) which supply raw water to a municipal water treatment plant. Results showed that the spatial variability of acesulfame and chloride within the watershed of the lake-river systems depends on the location of contaminant sources, mainly municipal wastewater and septic tank discharges (for acesulfame) and the presence of small tributaries of the lake and river (for chloride). Temporal variability of the tracers under study differed according to the sampling location and was mainly affected by seasonal conditions. Correlation analyses between the two tracers in lake and river waters (in terms of concentrations and loads) made it possible to pinpoint the probable origins of contamination. The assessment of the spatio-temporal variability of these co-tracers within the lake-river watersheds allowed for the delineation of priority intervention zones as a decision-making tool for municipal authorities in improving drinking water source protection.					; Rodriguez, Manuel/P-3713-2015	Rodriguez, Manuel J/0000-0003-2010-6438; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				SEP 15	2021	203								117493	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117493		AUG 2021						34365194					WOS:000697762400005

In this study, both the bacterial and phytoplankton communities were examined in the oligotrophic Lake Basomtso and the eutrophic Lake South (China). The results of this study showed that the phytoplankton density and diversity in the eutrophic lake were higher than those in the oligotrophic lake. Furthermore, Chlorophyta (68%) and Cryptophyta (24%) were the dominant groups in the eutrophic lake, while Bacillariophyta (95%) dominated in the oligotrophic lake. The bacterial communities in the waters and sediments of the two lakes were mainly composed of Proteobacteria (mean of 32%), Actinobacteria (mean of 25%), Bacteroidetes (mean of 12%), and Chloroflexi (mean of 6%). Comparative analysis showed that the abundance of bacteria in the eutrophic lake was higher than that in the oligotrophic lake (p < 0.05), but the bacterial diversity in the oligotrophic lake was higher than that in the eutrophic lake (p < 0.05). Finally, the bacterial abundance and diversity in the sediments of the two lakes were higher than those in the water samples (p < 0.05), and the Latescibacteria and Nitrospinae groups were identified only in the sediments. These results suggest that both the phytoplankton and bacterial communities differed considerably between the oligotrophic lake and the eutrophic lake.					; Li, Dapeng/K-6315-2018	jingyi, Jia/0000-0002-0552-081X; Li, Dapeng/0000-0002-8232-3094														2076-2607				DEC	2019	7	12							621	10.3390/microorganisms7120621	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms7120621								31783682					WOS:000506646400039

Louise; Mahardja, Brian; Khanna, Shruti			Impacts of water hyacinth treatment on water quality in a tidal estuarine environment	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is an invasive species that has modified ecosystem functioning in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), California, USA. Studies in lakes and rivers have shown that water hyacinth alters water quality. In tidal systems, such as the Delta, water moves back and forth through the water hyacinth patch so water quality directly outside the patch in either direction is likely to be impacted. In this study, we asked whether the presence or treatment of water hyacinth with herbicides resulted in changes in water quality in this tidal system. We combined existing datasets that were originally collected for permit compliance and long-term regional monitoring into a dataset that we analyzed with a before-after control-impact framework. This approach allowed us to describe effects of presence and treatment of water hyacinth, while accounting for seasonal patterns in water quality. We found that although effects of treatment were not detectable when compared with water immediately upstream, dissolved oxygen and turbidity became more similar to regional water quality averages after treatment. Temperature became less similar to the regional average after treatment, but the magnitude of the change was small. Taken together, these results suggest that tidal hydrology exports the effects of water hyacinth upstream, just as river flow is known to transport the effects downstream, creating a buffer of altered water chemistry around patches. It also suggests that although water hyacinth has an effect on dissolved oxygen and turbidity, these parameters recover to regional averages after treatment.					; Khanna, Shruti/AAI-5171-2020; Tobias, Vanessa/AAE-1897-2020	Khanna, Shruti/0000-0003-1724-248X; Conrad, Louise/0000-0002-1145-7503; Tobias, Vanessa/0000-0003-4872-1643; Mahardja, Brian/0000-0003-0695-3745; 													1387-3547	1573-1464				DEC	2019	21	12					3479	3490		10.1007/s10530-019-02061-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02061-2													WOS:000492419000003

This study provides a novel method to estimate surface runoff through remote sensing of supraglacial lake volumes. Because terminal, non-draining (consistently expanding during the melt season) lakes impound runoff from their surrounding contributing catchments, such changes reflect runoff produced within the catchment. To estimate supraglacial lake volumes, multi-temporal lake maps derived from Landsat-8 images are intersected with dry lake-bed topographic depressions (showing lake bathymetry) identified for two supraglacial catchments (similar to 10 km(2)) in southwestern GrIS, using high-resolution (2 m) ArcticDEMs. Intersecting remotely sensed lake shorelines with their underlying ice surface topography yields multi-temporal lake volume changes, which are then compared with cumulative runoff as simulated by four Surface Mass Balance (SMB) models (HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, RACMO2.3, and MERRA-2). Comparison of cumulative lake infilling with SMB simulations for these two lakes over the period 8-31 July 2015 indicates that SMB models overestimated surface runoff by 106 - 123%. These large offsets improved after early July, overestimating runoff by 40 - 55%. The runoff delay function incorporated into the MAR3.6 model improves simulation of early melt season runoff, signifying the importance of integrating meltwater routing schemes into SMB models for improved understanding of Greenland supraglacial hydrology and surface mass balance.

Energy input is primary controller of methane bubbling in subarctic lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Emission of methane (CH4) from surface waters is often dominated by ebullition (bubbling), a transport mode with high-spatiotemporal variability. Based on new and extensive CH4 ebullition data, we demonstrate striking correlations (r(2) between 0.92 and 0.997) when comparing seasonal bubble CH4 flux from three shallow subarctic lakes to four readily measurable proxies of incoming energy flux and daily flux magnitudes to surface sediment temperature (r(2) between 0.86 and 0.94). Our results after continuous multiyear sampling suggest that CH4 ebullition is a predictable process, and that heat flux into the lakes is the dominant driver of gas production and release. Future changes in the energy received by lakes and ponds due to shorter ice-covered seasons will predictably alter the ebullitive CH4 flux from freshwater systems across northern landscapes. This finding is critical for our understanding of the dynamics of radiatively important trace gas sources and associated climate feedback.

However, how biomass production is linked to flooding patterns in wetland areas remains unclear. We utilized gauging station data, a digital elevation model, vegetation survey data, and a Landsat 8 image to study the effects of average inundation depth (AID) and inundation duration (IDU) of flooding on end-of-season biomass of vegetation in Poyang Lake wetland, in particular, after operation of Three Gorges Dam. The end-of-season biomass of wetland vegetation showed Gaussian distributions along both the AID and IDU gradients. The most favorable flooding conditions for biomass production of vegetation in the wetland had an AID ranging from 3.9 to 4.0 m and an IDU ranging from 39% to 41%. For sites with a lower AID (<3.9 m; IDU < 39%), the end-of-season biomass values were positively related, whereas for sites with a higher AID (4.0 m; IDU > 41%), the end-of-season biomass values were negatively related. After the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, flooding patterns characterized by AID and IDU of the Poyang Lake wetland were significantly alleviated, resulting in a mixed changing trend of vegetation biomass across the wetland. Compared with 1980-2002, the increase of end-of-season biomass in lower surfaces caused by the alleviated flooding pattern far exceeded the decrease of end-of-season biomass in higher surfaces, resulting in an end-of-season biomass increase of 1.0%-6.7% since 2003. These results improved our understanding of the production trends of vegetation in the wetland and provided additional scientific guidance for vegetation restoration and wetland management in similar wetlands.					dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024														1664-462X					OCT 16	2020	11								521358	10.3389/fpls.2020.521358	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.521358								33178232					WOS:000584725600001

Many diarrheal diseases are caused by the presence of enteric pathogens in surface water including Escherichia coli (E. coli), a frequently used indicator of the presence of these pathogens. Yet, few studies have been carried out in West Africa to verify this link or to study the relationship between diarrheal diseases, E. coli and environmental parameters. These diarrheal diseases also influenced by socio-health vulnerabilities. This case study addresses the dynamics of E. coli along with another fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci, as well as diarrheal diseases (from three health centers) and socio-health vulnerability (from three villages and Fulani settlements) and their relationship with hydro-meteorological parameters derivable by satellite. The study site is located in the Bagre reservoir in Burkina Faso where Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and E. coli were monitored over one year. Water was generally polluted by bacteria of fecal origin throughout the year and more so during the rainy season. We observed a significant relationship between E. coli and enterococci. E. coli concentrations were strongly correlated to, and predicted by, precipitation, satellite reflectance in the NIR band by Sentinel-2, and SPM measured in-situ. Diarrheal diseases were also strongly correlated with these variables as well as E. coli. Vulnerability of the population to diarrhea increases during the rainy season. The microbiological health risk is more important during the rainy season, from June to September, and especially concerns the Fulani settlements. In 2017, diarrheal diseases were responsible for 606 024 deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. This situation is due to domestic and recreational use of polluted surface waters, deficits in hygiene, access to healthcare and drinking water, and to weak environmental and health monitoring infrastructures. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an indicator for the enteric pathogens that cause many diarrheal diseases. The links between E. coli, diarrheal diseases and environmental parameters have not received much attention in West Africa, and few studies have assessed health risks by taking into account hazards and socio-health vulnerabilities. This case study, carried out in Burkina Faso (Bagre Reservoir), aims at filling this knowledge gap by analyzing the environmental variables that play a role in the dynamics of E. coli, cases of diarrhea, and by identifying initial vulnerability criteria. A particular focus is given to satellite-derived parameters to assess whether remote sensing can provide a useful tool to assess the health hazard. Samples of surface water were routinely collected to measure E. coli, enterococci and suspended particulate matter (SPM) at a monitoring point (Kapore) during one year. In addition, satellite data were used to estimate precipitation, water level, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and SPM. Monthly epidemiological data for cases of diarrhea from three health centers were also collected and compared with microbiological and environmental data. Finally, semi-structured interviews were carried out to document the use of water resources, contact with elements of the hydrographic network, health behavior and condition, and water and health policy and prevention, in order to identify the initial vulnerability criteria. A positive correlation between E. coli and enterococci in surface waters was found indicating that E. coli is an acceptable indicator of fecal contamination in this region. E. coli and diarrheal diseases were strongly correlated with monsoonal precipitation, in situ SPM, and Near Infra-Red (NIR) band between March and November. Partial least squares regression showed that E. coli concentration was strongly associated with precipitation, Sentinel-2 reflectance in the NIR and SPM, and that the cases of diarrhea were strongly associated with precipitation, NIR, E. coli, SPM, and to a lesser extent with NDVI. Moreover, E. coli dynamics were reproduced using satellite data alone, particularly from February to mid-December (R-2 = 0.60) as were cases of diarrhea throughout the year (R-2 = 0.76). This implies that satellite data could provide an important contribution to water quality monitoring. Finally, the vulnerability of the population was found to increase during the rainy season due to reduced accessibility to healthcare and drinking water sources and increased use of water of poor quality. During this period, surface water is used because it is close to habitations, easy to use and free from monetary or political constraints. This vulnerability is aggravated by marginality and particularly affects the Fulani, whose concessions are often close to surface water (river, lake) and far from health centers.					; Rochelle-Newall, Emma/AEU-2465-2022	ROBERT, Elodie/0000-0003-3865-1194; Rochelle-Newall, Emma/0000-0003-0951-8650; 													1935-2735					AUG	2021	15	8							e0009634	10.1371/journal.pntd.0009634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009634								34403418					WOS:000685792200001

In this study, we explore the value of seasonal forecasting for decision-making at five case study sites located in extratropical regions. The forecasting tools used integrate seasonal climate model forecasts with freshwater impact models of catchment hydrology, lake conditions (temperature, water level, chemistry, and ecology), and fish migration timing and were co-developed together with water managers. To explore the decision-making value of forecasts, we carried out a qualitative assessment of (1) how useful forecasts would have been for a problematic past season and (2) the relevance of any windows of opportunity (seasons and variables where forecasts are thought to perform well) for management. Overall, water managers were optimistic about the potential for improved decision-making and identified actions that could be taken based on forecasts. However, there was often a mismatch between those variables that could best be predicted and those which would be most useful for management. Reductions in forecast uncertainty and a need to develop practical, hands-on experience were identified as key requirements before forecasts would be used in operational decision-making. Seasonal climate forecasts provided little added value to freshwater forecasts in these extratropical study sites, and we discuss the conditions under which seasonal climate forecasts with only limited skill are most likely to be worth incorporating into freshwater forecasting workflows.					; Marce, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Mercado-Bettin, DANIEL/HPF-6131-2023; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Clayer, François/I-6670-2015; Marcé, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Frias, Maria/F-4874-2012; French, Andrew/Q-8012-2016; Clayer, Francois/I-6670-2015	Puertolas, Laura/0000-0002-1957-5571; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491; Marce, Rafael/0000-0002-7416-4652; Frias, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-5148-1156; Jackson-Blake, Leah/0000-0002-4915-8779; Moore, Tadhg/0000-0002-3834-8868; Clayer, Francois/0000-0001-6939-400X; Mercado-Bettin, Daniel/0000-0003-4572-3029													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAR 14	2022	26	5					1389	1406		10.5194/hess-26-1389-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1389-2022													WOS:000771262400001

An Embryonic Field of Study: The Aquatic Fate and Toxicity of Diluted Bitumen	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Canada has experienced a significant increase in the transport of diluted bitumen (dilbit), a predominant oil sands product that combines bitumen with diluents derived from oil-gas condensates and other proprietary compounds. The proportion of diluent and the chemical composition of dilbit vary to meet seasonal transport requirements. While the toxic effects of a variety of crude and refined oils are well-studied, the toxicity of dilbit to aquatic species is less well known. This focused review summarizes dilbit production, chemistry, and the few data on toxicity to aquatic species. These data suggest that un-weathered dilbit would cause effects on fish equivalent to those of conventional oils, but its toxicity may be lower, depending on interactions among test conditions, the behavior of dilbit added to water and the species tested.					; Langlois, Valerie/NES-9593-2025	Langlois, Valerie S./0000-0003-4031-6838; 													0007-4861	1432-0800				JAN	2018	100	1			SI		8	13		10.1007/s00128-017-2239-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-017-2239-7								29243210					WOS:000422953500003

Seasonal variability of natural water chemistry affects the fate and behaviour of silver nanoparticles	CHEMOSPHERE												Understanding the environmental behaviour of nanoparticles (NPs) after release into aquatic systems is essential to predict the environmental implications of nanotechnology. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) represent a major class of engineered NPs with a significant potential for environmental impact. Therefore, investigating their transformations in natural waters will help predict their long term environmental fate and behaviour. AgNPs were characterized in natural lake water collected seasonally from the same freshwater source, using column microcosms to assess their behaviour and transport at different depths. Building on our previous work using similar systems with synthetic waters, the influence of water chemistry and NP surface modifications on colloidal stability and dissolution in natural lake water over time was investigated. A simple sedimentation-diffusion model parameterized by the particle properties and total Ag concentration was successfully used to understand AgNPs transport behaviour. PVP coated AgNPs remained colloidally stable, with their transport in the water column dominated by diffusion, and exhibited no significant or substantial changes in data or model parameters for different seasons. Citrate coated AgNPs were susceptible to rapid aggregation, sedimentation, dissolution and reprecipitation; their transport in the water column was determined by both diffusion and sedimentation.

S	Schneider, JW; Scholze, F		Lucas, SG; Shen, SZ		Schneider, Joerg W.; Scholze, Frank			Late Pennsylvanian-Early Triassic conchostracan biostratigraphy: a preliminary approach	PERMIAN TIMESCALE	Geological Society Special Publication											Conchostracans are one of the most common fossil animal groups of continental deposits from late Palaeozoic to modern times. Their habitats have ranged from perennial lakes of the Carboniferous and Early Permian to seasonal playa lakes and temporary ponds from the late Early Permian into the Triassic, where they could form mass occurrences. This, together with relatively high speciation rates, makes them ideal guide fossils, especially in otherwise fossil-poor wet and dry red beds. Based on material and data collected since the 1980s from both surface outcrops and well cores in central Europe, a preliminary conchostracan zonation is proposed. We used a conservative approach, erecting assemblage zones comprising two or three species instead of speciesrange zones with only one or, sometimes, two forms. Assemblage zones are more robust and provide more reliability for each delineated time interval. Isotopically dated occurrences of conchostracan zone species, or co-occurrences of conchostracans, insect zone species and marine index fossils such as conodonts and fusulinids, allow us to correlate our assemblage zones with the marine Standard Global Chronostratigraphic Scale.																			0305-8719		978-1-78620-282-6				2018	450						365	386		10.1144/SP450.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP450.6													WOS:000431823200015

However, the mechanisms underlying the RWU of alpine crops in rainfed cropland remain poorly understood. This study investigated seasonal variations in water uptake of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) and highland barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) coupled with dual stable isotope tracers at different growth stages. The method of direct inference showed that the soil depth layer from which water was predominantly taken up by roots was 0-30 cm. More specifically, oilseed rape and highland barley exhibited different RWU patterns: oilseed rape had the high flexible performance and could revert to deep soil layers (30-60 cm) as the main water source according to soil water availability due to short-term droughts at the peak growth stage. In contrast, water uptake by highland barley was primarily derived from both shallow and middle soil layers (< 30 cm) throughout all growth stages. These findings indicated that the appropriate irrigation wetting depth should be above 30 cm for the different growth stages.

However, measurements are rare. We estimated the terrestrial load of DOC, DIC, and methane (CH4) to a small boreal lake for the open water period, on the basis of measured concentrations of carbon species in near-shore groundwater wells and inlet streams, and measured area-specific discharge. The subcatchment directly draining into the lake via groundwater seepage contributed 18% to the total water input during the open water season. Compared to stream and lake water, near-shore groundwater concentrations of DOC were slightly elevated, and groundwater DIC and CH4 concentrations were highly elevated. Consequently, direct groundwater seepage contributed 27% to the total DOC load, 64% to the total DIC load, and 96% to the total CH4 load from the catchment to the lake. Groundwater DIC import corresponded only to 5-8% of lake carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. In incubation experiments, we observed higher photochemical DOC loss rates in stream and groundwater samples (18-55% DOC loss upon 72h UV-A exposure) than in lake water (15% DOC loss) and detected significant DOC flocculation in groundwater samples in both light and dark incubations (2-24% DOC loss). We conclude that even in regions where lake hydrology is dominated by surface water inflow via inlet streams, direct groundwater seepage can represent an important carbon source to boreal lakes, and groundwater DOC may be susceptible to in-lake removal via degradation and flocculation.

Their complicated life cycles involve freshwater snails as intermediate hosts. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Yen Bai and Thanh Hoa provinces in North and Central Vietnam, to investigate the diversity of cercariae of potential FZT and to construct the phylogenetic relationship of trematode cercariae based on the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region. Among 17 snail species collected from various habitats, 13 were infected by 10 cercarial groups among which parapleurolophocercous, pleurolophocercous, and echinostome cercariae were of zoonotic importance. The monophyletic tree separated cercarial sequences into different groups following the description of the cercariae families in which Haplorchidae, Opisthorchiidae, Echinochasmidae, and Echinostomatidae are important families of FZT. The overall prevalence was different among snail species and habitats and showed a seasonal trend. Parapleurolophocercous and echinostome cercariae emerged as the most common cercariae in snails in Yen Bai, while monostome, echinostome, and megalura cercariae were most common in Thanh Hoa. Using a molecular approach, we identified Parafossarulus striatulus as the first intermediate snail host of Clonorchis sinensis in Thac Ba Lake. Melanoides tuberculata and Bithynia fuchsiana were we identified preferred intermediate snail hosts of a diverse range of trematode species including intestinal flukes (i.e., Haplorchis pumilio and Echinochasmus japonicus) in Yen Bai and Thanh Hoa, respectively.

Sulfonamides and quinolones were identified as the major contaminants in surface waters, with aquaculture and healthcare wastewater responsible for over 80 % of the antibiotic load. Contrasting seasonal patterns were observed between freshwater (wet season: 215 ng/L, dry season: 99.9 ng/L) and tidal estuaries (wet season: 45.9 ng/L, dry season: 121 ng/L), attributed to antibiotic transport from terrestrial sources or coastal aquaculture areas. The estimated annual antibiotic influx into Jiaozhou Bay was 70.4 kg/year, posing a considerable threat to aquatic algae and disrupting the stability of aquatic food chain. BugBase predictions suggested that antibiotics in the environment suppressed bacteria characterized by biofilm formation (FB) and the presence of mobile elements (CME). However, ARG transmission was likely to drive the spread of CME, FB, and stress-tolerant (OST) bacteria within microbial communities. The significant positive correlations observed between sulfamethoxazole and 63 microbial genera indicate a broad distribution of microbial resistance, which exacerbates the potential for ARG accumulation and dissemination across both the bay and the Yellow Sea.					liu, kaiwen/GVS-5259-2022; LI, YANAN/NAZ-1208-2025; Wang, Jiakai/ABB-3894-2022; Kun, Wang/KVA-4884-2024; Zhang, Yaru/JEP-7689-2023	Wang, Kun/0009-0003-9163-3179; 													0304-3894	1873-3336				DEC 5	2024	480								136006	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136006		OCT 2024						39357363					WOS:001330215300001

Here, spatiotemporal variations of dissolved MC-RR and MC-LR were evaluated monthly in 2016 in the Yulin River, a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The environmental factors that linked to MCs concentration were discussed. The results revealed that MC-RR maximumly reached 3.55 mu g/L, and the maximum MC-LR concentration exceeded the threshold value of 1.0 mu g/L recommended by the WHO. MCs concentrations were higher during the flood season and decreased from the estuary to the upstream reach of the Yulin River. Ecological risk assessment confirmed that MC-LR had significant adverse effects on the benthonic invertebrates Potamopyrgus antipodarum. MCs content in the sediment was 1.70- to 20-fold higher than that in suspended particulate matter (SPM). The impacts of environmental factors on the MCs profile differed between flood and dry seasons and the longitudinal differences of MCs were determined by the longitudinal profile of water velocity and SPM content, which were affected by TGR operations. This study suggested that the occurrence of MCs in the Yulin River were influenced by hydrologic regime in TGR. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The multi-proxy analysis (sedimentology, high-resolution elemental geochemistry and pollen) of a 12 m long sediment core, supported by seven AMS radiocarbon dates and Cs-137 dating, enable a precise reconstruction of the environmental change that occurred in the central Mediterranean region during the last similar to 4.5 cal kyrs BP. Sediments consist of triplets of authigenic carbonates, organic matter and clayey laminae. Fluctuations in the thickness and/or presence of these different types of seasonal laminae indicate variations in water salinity, organic productivity and runoff in the lake's catchment, as a result of the complex interplay of tectonics, anthropogenic forcing and climate variability. The progradation of the Pavllo river delta, favoured by variable human activity from the nearby ancient city of Butrint, led to the progressive isolation of this hydrological system from the Ionian Sea. The system evolved from an open bay to a restricted lagoon, which is consistent with archaeological data. An abrupt increase in mass-wasting activity between 1515 and 1450 BC, likely caused by nearby seismic activity, led to the accumulation of 24 homogenites, up to 17 cm thick. They have been deposited during the onset of finely laminated sedimentation, which indicates restricted, anoxic bottom water conditions and higher salinity. Periods of maximum water salinity, biological productivity, and carbonate precipitation coincide with warmer intervals, such as the early Roman Warm Period (RWP) (500 BC-0 AD), the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (800-1400 AD) and recent times (after 1800 AD). Conversely, lower salinity and more oxic conditions, with higher clastic input were recorded during 1400-500 BC, the Late Roman and the Early Medieval periods (0-800 AD) and during the Little Ice Age (1400-1800 AD). Hydrological fluctuations recorded in Butrint are in phase with most central and western Mediterranean records and correlate with NAO variability. In contrast, opposite hydrological patterns have been recorded in the Eastern Balkans and the Levant during the last millennium, emphasizing a complex spatial variability in the region. Phases of maximum settlement intensity in Butrint (Roman-Late Antique) coincide with warmer and/or stable climate periods (0-800 AD and MCA, respectively), indicating a long-term influence of climatic conditions on human activities. The Late Holocene sedimentary record of Lake Butrint demonstrates the complex interplay of climate variability, tectonics and human impact in the recent evolution of coastal Mediterranean regions.

This study aims to assess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) leaching losses under real conditions in different water and N managements. Two water and three N treatments are conducted in the Taihu Lake region of China. Results show that the total N leaching losses during the rice season under flooding irrigation (FI) are 12.4, 9.31, and 7.17 kg ha(-1) for farmers' fertilization practices (FFP), site-specific N management (SSNM), and controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer management (CRN), respectively. Under controlled irrigation (CI), the respective losses were 7.40, 5.86, and 3.79 kg ha(-1) for the same management methods. The total P leaching losses during the rice season under FI were 0.939, 0.927, and 0.353 kg ha(-1) for FFP, SSNM, and CRN, respectively. Under CI, the losses were 0.424, 0.433, and 0.279 kg ha(-1), respectively, for the same management methods. Ammonium and nitrate N accounted for 42.2-65.5% and 11.8-14.7% of the total nitrogen leaching losses under different water and N management methods, respectively. Due to significant decrease of volumes of percolation water and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in percolation water, N and P leaching losses were reduced in the CI treatment compared to the FI treatment under the same N management. The reduction of N input and application of controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer can reduce N and P leaching losses from paddy fields.

In this study, a high-resolution thermodynamic ice model was applied in experiments of lake ice evolution and energy balance of a shallow lake in the QTP. Basal growth and melt dominated the seasonal evolution of lake ice, but surface sublimation was also crucial for ice loss, accounting for up to 40 % of the maximum ice thickness. Sublimation was also responsible for 41 % of the lake water loss during the ice-covered period. Simulation results matched the observations well with respect to ice mass balance components, ice thickness, and ice temperature. Strong solar radiation, negative air temperature, low air moisture, and prevailing strong winds were the major driving forces controlling the seasonal ice mass balance. The energy balance was estimated at the ice surface and bottom, and within the ice interior and under-ice water. Particularly, almost all heat fluxes showed significant diurnal variations including incoming, absorbed, and penetrated solar radiation, long-wave radiation, turbulent air-ice heat fluxes, and basal ice-water heat fluxes. The calculated ice surface temperature indicated that the atmospheric boundary layer stratification was consistently stable or neutral through- out the ice-covered period. The turbulent air-ice heat fluxes and the net heat gain by the lake were much lower than those during the open-water period.

We present a data-driven synthesis of GHG emissions from northern cryosphere inland waters considering water body types, cryosphere zones, and seasonality. We find that annual GHG emissions are dominated by carbon dioxide (1149.2(1004.8)(1307.5 )teragrams of CO2; median(Q1)(Q3)) and methane (14.2(10.1)(18.5 )teragrams of CH4), while the nitrous oxide emission (5.4-1.412.2 gigagrams of N2O) is minor. The annual CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) GHG emissions from northern cryosphere inland waters total 1.51.31.8 or 2.31.82.8 petagrams of CO(2)e using the 100- or 20-year global warming potentials, respectively. Rivers emit 64% more CO2e GHGs than lakes, despite having only one-fifth of their surface area. The continuous permafrost zone contributed half of the inland water GHG emissions. Annual CO(2)e emissions from northern cryosphere inland waters exceed the region's terrestrial net ecosystem exchange, highlighting the important role of inland waters in the cryospheric land-aquatic continuum under a warming climate.

J	Salvarina, I; Gravier, D; Rothhaupt, KO				Salvarina, Ioanna; Gravier, Dorian; Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto			Seasonal bat activity related to insect emergence at three temperate lakes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Knowledge of aquatic food resources entering terrestrial systems is important for food web studies and conservation planning. Bats, among other terrestrial consumers, often profit from aquatic insect emergence and their activity might be closely related to such events. However, there is a lack of studies which monitor bat activity simultaneously with aquatic insect emergence, especially from lakes. Thus, our aim was to understand the relationship between insect emergence and bat activity, and investigate whether there is a general spatial or seasonal pattern at lakeshores. We assessed whole-night bat activity using acoustic monitoring and caught emerging and aerial flying insects at three different lakes through three seasons. We predicted that insect availability and seasonality explain the variation in bat activity, independent of the lake size and characteristics. Spatial (between lakes) differences of bat activity were stronger than temporal (seasonal) differences. Bat activity did not always correlate to insect emergence, probably because other factors, such as habitat characteristics, or bats' energy requirements, play an important role as well. Aerial flying insects explained bat activity better than the emerged aquatic insects in the lake with lowest insect emergence. Bats were active throughout the night with some activity peaks, and the pattern of their activity also differed among lakes and seasons. Lakes are important habitats for bats, as they support diverse bat communities and activity throughout the night and the year when bats are active. Our study highlights that there are spatial and temporal differences in bat activity and its hourly nocturnal pattern, that should be considered when investigating aquatic-terrestrial interactions or designing conservation and monitoring plans.

In this study, the cyanobacterial bloom disappearance and reappearance in Lake Taihu, China, in response to short-term hydrodynamic fluctuations, was investigated by field sampling, long-term ecological records, high-frequency sensors and MODIS satellite images. The horizontal drift caused by the dominant easterly wind during the phytoplankton growth season was mainly responsible for cyanobacterial biomass accumulation in the western and northern regions of the lake and subsequent bloom formation over relatively long time scales. The cyanobacterial bloom changed slowly under calm or gentle wind conditions. In contrast, the short-term bloom events within a day were mainly caused by entrainment and disentrainment of cyanobacterial colonies by wind-induced hydrodynamics. Observation of a westerly event in Lake Taihu revealed that when the 30 min mean wind speed (flow speed) exceeded the threshold value of 6 m/s (5.7 cm/s), cyanobacteria in colonies were entrained by the wind-induced hydrodynamics. Subsequently, the vertical migration of cyanobacterial colonies was controlled by hydrodynamics, resulting in thorough mixing of algal biomass throughout the water depth and the eventual disappearance of surface blooms. Moreover, the intense mixing can also increase the chance for forming larger and more cyanobacterial colonies, namely, aggregation. Subsequently, when the hydrodynamics became weak, the cyanobacterial colonies continuously float upward without effective buoyancy regulation, and cause cyanobacterial bloom explosive expansion after the westerly. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that the strong wind happening frequently during April and October can be an important cause of the formation and expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu.					; Wu, Tingfeng/KDN-9741-2024; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013	Wu, Tingfeng/0000-0002-9985-7746; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2013	20	12					8546	8556		10.1007/s11356-013-1812-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1812-9								23677755					WOS:000327498600025

Iestyn			Multi-model projections of future evaporation in a sub-tropical lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake evaporation plays an important role in the water budget of lakes. Predicting lake evaporation responses to climate change is thus of paramount importance for the planning of mitigation and adaption strategies. However, most studies that have simulated climate change impacts on lake evaporation have typically utilised a single mechanistic model. Whilst such studies have merit, projected changes in lake evaporation from any single lake model can be considered uncertain. To better understand evaporation responses to climate change, a multi-model approach (i.e., where a range of projections are considered), is desirable. In this study, we present such multi-model analysis, where five lake models forced by four different climate model projections are used to simu-late historic and future change (1901-2099) in lake evaporation. Our investigation, which focuses on sub-tropical Lake Kinneret (Israel), suggested considerable differences in simulated evaporation rates among the models, with the annual average evaporation rates varying between 1232 mm year(-1) and 2608 mm year(-1) during the historic period (1901-2005). We explored these differences by comparing the models with reference evaporation rates estimated using in-situ data (2000-2005) and a bulk aerodynamic algorithm. We found that the model ensemble generally captured the intra-annual variability in reference evaporation rates, and compared well at seasonal timescales (RMSEc = 0.19, R = 0.92). Using the model ensemble, we then projected future change in evaporation rates under three different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5. Our projections indicated that, by the end of the 21st century (2070-2099), annual average evaporation rates would increase in Lake Kinneret by 9-22 % under RCPs 2.6-8.5. When compared with pro-jected regional declines in precipitation, our projections suggested that the water balance of Lake Kinneret could experience a deficit of 14-40 % this century. We anticipate this substantial projected deficit combined with a considerable growth in population expected for this region could have considerable negative impacts on water availability and would consequently increase regional water stress.					; Couture, Raoul/AGR-6683-2022; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Shatwell, Tom/K-2937-2013; Shatwell, Tom/ABF-1308-2020; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023	Moore, Tadhg/0000-0002-3834-8868; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; Gal, Gideon/0000-0002-6962-4001; Shatwell, Tom/0000-0002-4520-7916; Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Raman Vinna, Love/0000-0002-9108-8057; La Fuente Pillco, Ruth Sofia/0000-0002-9665-672X													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2022	615		A						128729	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128729		NOV 2022											WOS:000895943300002

Hydrochemistry and isotopes were analyzed to identify spatial and temporal varieties of main nitrate sources in a large drinking water reservoir in East China. The results showed that NO3- was the main nitrogen form in both the dry and wet seasons, but dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was increased in the wet season. The N-15-NO3- values (+1.3 to +11.8) and O-18-NO3- values (+2.5 parts per thousand to +13.5 parts per thousand), combined with principal component analysis (PCA), indicated that chemical fertilizer was the main nitrate source during the dry season, while chemical fertilizer, soil N, and sewage/manure were the main nitrate sources during the wet season in the Qiandao Lake area. And, the nitrate isotopes showed the significant nitrification and assimilation in the Qiandao Lake area. A Bayesian isotopic mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R) was applied to the spatial and seasonal trends in the proportional contribution of four NO3- sources (chemical fertilizer (CF), soil nitrogen (SN), sewage and manure (SM), and atmospheric deposition (AD)) in the Qiandao Lake area. It was revealed that CF was the most important nitrate source in the dry season, accounting for 53.4% with 19.2% of SM and 18.9% of SN, while the contribution of SN increased in the wet season, accounting for 31.6%, followed by CF (30.8%) and then SM (24.2%). The main nitrate sources in the urban area, rural area, and central lake area were CF and SN, accounting for 66.1% in the urban area, 71.7% in the rural area, and 68.2% in the central lake area. Measures should be made to improve chemical fertilizer use efficiency and to reduce nitrogen loss in the Qiandao Lake area.

Furthermore, the possibility of in-lake photochemical degradation of the analytes was studied in laboratory experiments using spiked ultrapure water and lake water samples incubated in Teflon bottles (which transmit sunlight). TBEP, TiBP, and TnBP were photochemically degraded in spiked lake water samples upon exposure to sunlight. Organophosphate concentrations in the more remote lakes were often below or close to the limits of quantification (LOQ). TCPP was the substance with the highest median concentration in rural volcanic lakes (7-18 ng L(-1)) indicating an atmospheric transport of the compound. At urban lakes their median concentrations were in the range of 23-61. ng L(-1) (TCEP), 85-126 ng L(-1) (TCPP), <LOQ-53 ng L(-1) (TBEP), 8-10 ng L(-1) (TiBP), and 17-32 ng L(-1) (TnBP). High variability but no significant seasonal trends were observed for all five organophosphates in urban lake water samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Usumacinta River Basin, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, hosts several floodplain lakes, whose integrity is threatened by water resource development. We aimed to investigate how food webs in these ecosystems vary in relation to their hydrological connectivity and seasonal flood cycles. To do this, we combined analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in two lakes with permanent connection to the Usumacinta River and two isolated lakes during dry, early rainy and late rainy season. Significant differences in chlorophyll-a, nutrients and suspended solids were reflected in distinct trophic dynamics among lakes. Stable isotope analysis revealed that fish from all lakes relied predominantly on autochthonous primary production, but while phytoplankton was the dominant resource for fish in the isolated lakes, aquatic macrophytes made the highest contribution to consumers' production in the connected lakes. Fish tended to have broader isotopic niches during the early rainy season, likely reflecting consumption of a wider range of resources following the first flow pulses of the year. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity and natural flow regimes to maintain the outstanding biodiversity and fishery yield of these floodplain ecosystems.					; Cazzanelli, Matteo/AAG-5168-2021; Castillo, Maria/D-1759-2013	Soria-Barreto, Miriam/0000-0002-6114-3756; Cazzanelli, Matteo/0000-0002-8203-1366; Rodiles-Hernandez, Rocio/0000-0003-0355-5477													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2021	848	4					773	797		10.1007/s10750-020-04468-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04468-8		JAN 2021											WOS:000604160900001

Little is known about the indicators indicating heterogeneity of surface sediments. We aimed to identify the suitable indicators that can reflect the sediment heterogeneity by analyzing the sensitivity of sediment physicochemical properties group, microbial communities and diversity indices group and C, N, S-functional genes group to seasonal and regional changes. River sediments from different areas (urban area, urban-rural fringe and rural area) were collected in the level, dry and wet seasons, respectively. The chemical parameters had most significant regional heterogeneity, but no seasonal differences. Seasons had a greater impact on the overall microbial community structure than the areas. Specifically, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were more sensitive to seasonal changes. Overall, seasonal changes showed the greatest impact on the functional genes group, with the S-functional genes (dsrB and aprA) group providing the clearest seasonal variation. Considering the seasonal distribution of functional genes and their sensitivity to environmental factors, we speculated that the sulfate-reducing gene (dsrB), the methanogenic gene (mcrA) and the anammox gene (hzo) could be identified as sensitive indicators to indicate the seasonal heterogeneity of surface sediments in different river sections of the same river in the short term. We also concluded that environmental variables were more conducive to indicating the regional heterogeneity of sediments. This study provided a valuable reference for assessing the heterogeneity or ecological stress of river sediments.

For a multitemporal analysis of large regions or entire Greenland, largely automated processing routines are required. Here, we present a sequence of algorithms that allow for an automated Sentinel-2 data search, download, processing, and generation of a consistent and dense melt pond area time-series based on open-source software.

Our lake detection is based on the ratio of the blue and red visible bands using a minimum threshold. To remove false classification caused by the similar spectra of shadow and water on ice, we implement a shadow model to mask out topographically induced artifacts. We identified 880 individual lakes, traceable over 479 time-steps throughout 2016-2019, with an average size of 64,212 m(2). Of the four years, 2019 had the most extensive lake area coverage with a maximum of 333 km(2) and a maximum individual lake size of 30 km(2). With 1.5 days average observation interval, our time-series allows for a comparison with climate data of daily resolution, enabling a better understanding of short-term climate-glacier feedbacks.					; Braun, Matthias/A-4968-2009; Braun, Matthias/S-4693-2016	Neckel, Niklas/0000-0003-4300-5488; Humbert, Angelika/0000-0002-0244-8760; Hochreuther, Philipp/0000-0001-7780-1525; Braun, Matthias/0000-0001-5169-1567; 														2072-4292				JAN	2021	13	2							205	10.3390/rs13020205	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13020205													WOS:000611962800001

These habitats and their fish populations are increasingly threatened by a variety of human pressures, including floodplain deforestation. However, the effects of multiple human pressures on these floodplain fisheries have not been studied in the Amazon River. Here, we investigated the combined effects of forest cover, river water level, fishing effort and distance from nearest urban center on the catch of the most exploited fish taxa. Our study integrated fisheries, hydrological, geographical, and satellite land cover change data for 21 floodplain lake systems over a ten-year period. We found that an ANCOVA model explained 91% of the variation in catch (p < 0.001) and, as usual, fishing effort was the most influential variable. Floodplain forest exerted a positive effect on fish catch, implying that a loss of 1 km(2) of floodplain forest induces up to 9% decreasing in fish catches. In addition, high river water level and distance from urban centers also had a positive effect on fish catches; even though, low river water levels did not present such effect. These results provide support to previous findings regarding the effects of habitat, hydrological, and human variables on floodplain fish catch. More importantly, these results provide the first ever quantitative evidence of the effect of floodplain deforestation on fish catch. Our findings point out the need to develop an ecosystemical approach to manage floodplain fisheries in the Amazon and elsewhere in the world.

Contrasting influences of stormflow and baseflow pathways on nitrogen and phosphorus export from an urban watershed	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Eutrophication of urban surface waters from excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs remains a major issue in water quality management. Although much research has focused on understanding loading of nutrients from storm events, there has been little research to understand the contribution of baseflow, the water moving through storm drains between rainfall events. We investigated the relative contributions of baseflow versus stormflow for loading of water and nutrients (various forms of N and P) by the storm drain network in six urban sub-watersheds in St. Paul, MN, USA. Across sites, baseflow made substantial contributions to warm season (May-October) water yields (27-66 % across sites), total N yields (31-68 %), and total P yields (7-32 %). These results show that while P was predominantly delivered by stormflow, N loading was similar between baseflow and stormflow. We found that baseflow was dominated by groundwater inputs, likely caused by interception of shallow groundwater by storm drains, but also that variability in N and P among sites was related in part to the connectivity of the storm drains to upstream lakes and wetlands in some watersheds. The substantial loading by groundwater-dominated baseflow, especially for N, implies that N management may require a broader focus on N source reduction, perhaps through improved land management, in order to prevent contamination of shallow groundwater via infiltration.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011	Nidzgorski, Daniel/0000-0003-4454-3042; Sterner, Robert/0000-0003-2292-6122; Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030													0168-2563	1573-515X				OCT	2014	121	1					209	228		10.1007/s10533-013-9926-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-013-9926-1													WOS:000341908600011

Isotopic records of climate seasonality in equid teeth	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We investigate how oxygen isotopes in equid teeth can be used as a record of seasonality. First, we use in situ laser ablation and conventional microsampling techniques to understand time-averaging of environmental signals in intra-tooth isotope profiles in modern feral horse teeth (n = 5) from Mongolia, where there is a large seasonal gradient in the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation. We demonstrate that laser ablation can be used to sample inner, middle, and outer enamel layers in large mammalian herbivore teeth. The inner enamel layer records less attenuated isotopic signals than other layers, as predicted by the mineralization patterns, but intra-tooth signal amplitude is similar for laser and conventional sampling methods. Second, we use modern zebra teeth (n = 21) collected in eastern Africa to evaluate how intra-tooth oxygen isotope variation relates to rainfall patterns in the tropics. We show that the intra-tooth isotopic range increases with intra-annual precipitation isotopic range, which in turn relates to aridity in the equatorial bimodal rainfall region but is influenced by other hydroclimate processes in the region as a whole. Finally, we address isotopic seasonality during the Early Pleistocene in eastern Africa using oxygen isotopes in fossil equid teeth from southwestern Kenya (n = 11) and northern Tanzania (n = 5). We find variable isotopic seasonality in the past, similar to present-day eastern Africa, consistent with the notion that hominins and other mammals were able to accommodate environmental variability on intra-annual scales in addition to well-documented orbital cycles.

This work investigated the seasonal hydrochemical evolution of coastal groundwater resources in Urmia plain, NW Iran. Two recently proposed methods have been used to comparison, recognize and understand the temporal and spatial evolution of saltwater intrusion in a coastal alluvial aquifer. The study takes into account that saltwater intrusion is a dynamic process, and that seasonal variations in the balance of the aquifer cause changes in groundwater chemistry. Pattern diagrams, which constitute the outcome of several hydrochemical processes, have traditionally been used to characterize vulnerability to sea/saltwater intrusion. However, the formats of such diagrams do not facilitate the geospatial analysis of groundwater quality, thus limiting the ability of spatio-temporal mapping and monitoring. This deficiency calls for methodologies which can translate information from some diagrams such Piper diagram into a format that can be mapped spatially. Distribution of groundwater chemistry types in Urmia plain based on modified Piper diagram using GQI(Piper(mix)) and GQI(Piper(dom)) indices that Mixed Ca-Mg-Cl and Ca-HCO3 are the dominant water types in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. In this study, a groundwater quality index specific to seawater intrusion (GQI(SWI)) was used to check its efficiency for the groundwater samples affected by Urmia hypersaline Lake, Iran. Analysis of the main processes, by means of the Hydrochemical Facies Evolution Diagram (HFE-Diagram), provides essential knowledge about the main hydrochemical processes. Subsequently, analysis of the spatial distribution of hydrochemical facies using heatmaps helps to identify the general state of the aquifer with respect to saltwater intrusion during different sampling periods. The HFE-D results appear to be very successful for differentiating variations through time in the salinization processes caused by saltwater intrusion into the aquifer, distinguishing the phase of saltwater intrusion from the phase of recovery, and their respective evolutions. Both GQI and HFE-D methods show that hydrochemical variations can be read in terms of the pattern of saltwater intrusion and groundwater quality status. But generally, in this case (i.e. saltwater and not seawater intrusion) the HFE-D method was presented better efficiency than GQI method (including GQI(Piper) and GQI(SWI)).					; Lak, Razyeh/Y-3056-2019; Amiri, Vahab/AAW-1555-2021; Nakhaei, Mohammad/A-5816-2019	Amiri, Vahab/0000-0001-9734-9812; Lak, Razyeh/0000-0003-3223-5528; Nakhaei, Mohammad/0000-0002-4823-5197													1436-3240	1436-3259				MAY	2016	30	5					1473	1484		10.1007/s00477-015-1108-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-015-1108-3													WOS:000379752800012

In the process, an understanding of particulate organic carbon sources, their flux, and their variability is important for understanding BCP effects, but these relative processes are still poorly understood. Therefore, we used a sediment trap experiment to collect settling particulate organic carbon (SPOC) and conducted a systematic study to understand the sources and factors that influence SPOC, as well as determine the amount of SPOC generated by the BCP effect by combing meteorological data monitoring and modern hydrochemical monitoring in the Dalongdong (DLD) reservoir, a karst groundwater-fed reservoir. Based on delta C-13, delta N-15, and molar C/N data, as well as relative models, the SPOC sources came from algae, re-suspened matter, soil, and domestic sewage. Among these, resuspension (45.27%) and algae (31.57%) were the main sources for SPOC. Thus, the seasonal variations in different sources were mainly affected by water movement caused by climate changing with respect to air temperature and rainfall. In addition, domestic sewage discharge in the DLD reservoir also affected the sources for SPOC. The results suggested that the SPOC from algal sources in the DLD reservoir was 17.07 gC/m(2)/a at the surface and 9.26 gC/m(2)/a at the bottom via the BCP process. The SPOC deposition efficiency (OCDE) of algae was 54.25%. Organic carbon from algal source via the BCP effect at the surface of water column was finally deposited and buried in sediment. According to estimation of historical data, the stored organic carbon through assimilating DIC from carbonate rock weathering by BCP effect was as much as 10.84 tC/a. The quantity of organic carbon stored and fixed by BCP effect cannot be ignored in the reservoirs.

J	la Forgia, G; Ottolenghi, L; Adduce, C; Falcini, F				la Forgia, Giovanni; Ottolenghi, Luisa; Adduce, Claudia; Falcini, Federico			Intrusions and solitons: Propagation and collision dynamics	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS												Triggering and evolution of internal solitary waves (ISWs) generated by intrusive gravity currents (IGCs) propagating into a stratified ambient fluid is analyzed by laboratory experiments. After the release of a fluid of uniform density, intermediate with respect to the upper (lower-density) and lower (higher-density) layers in the channel, the IGC develops and flows downstream, intruding into the pycnocline. Near the IGC leading front, the compression of the upper layer generates ISWs: they gradually separate from the current that propagates slower. Shoaling downstream over a uniform sloping boundary, solitons break and partially reflect. We investigate the dynamics of the interaction between the reflected ISWs and the incoming IGC. During the engage, an increase in the ISW celerity occurs, leading the celerity of the reflected waves to be even larger than the incident wave. Our analysis shows how both ISWs and IGCs can significantly change their features as they experience a change of the density structure in the water column. This is expected to occur, for example, in stratified small-scale basins, where river plumes intrude the seasonal thermocline. The radial ISWs, originated by IGCs, can then be reflected by the adjacent bottom bathymetry, spreading against the intrusive current from which they are generated.					; La Forgia, Giovanni/LWJ-5573-2024; Adduce, Claudia/A-1380-2011; Falcini, Federico/HIZ-8183-2022	ADDUCE, Claudia/0000-0002-0734-9569; LA FORGIA, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-8543-6369; Falcini, Federico/0000-0001-8105-2491; 													1070-6631	1089-7666				JUL 1	2020	32	7							076605	10.1063/5.0011604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0011604													WOS:000552661200001
J	Yaseen, AA; Takacs-Hajos, M				Yaseen, Arshad Abdulkhalq; Takacs-Hajos, Maria			The effect of plant biostimulants on the macronutrient content and ion ratio of several lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L.) cultivars grown in a plastic house	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Plant biostimulants have been identified as one of the most important agronomic factors that scientists have been looking for in a range of natural sources over the last few decades. The purpose of these experiments was to see how plant biostimulants (Willow bark extract, Bistep, and the combination of Willow+Bistep (W +B)) affect macronutrient content and ion ratio in three lettuce cultivars (May King, Kobak, and Great Lakes) from 2019 to 2021. Willow bark extract was diluted to 3% and applied to the plants through irrigation with the amount of 50 similar to 60 mL plant (1), whereas Bistep was sprayed every two weeks from transplanting in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations at 0.05% with the amount of 20 mL plant(1). The data demonstrate that over the grown seasons, the treatments W+B and Willow bark extract were the most effective biostimulants impacting macronutrient content and ion ratio, whereas Bistep was the least effective. In comparison to untreated plants, the amount of macronutrients (Ca2+, Mg2+, and P) in lettuce leaves rose by 18%, 13%, and 9%, respectively, in plants treated with W+B over a period of years, while, potassium (K+) significantly reduced by 15%. Sodium level, on the other hand, was significantly improved using plant biostimulants of Bistep, Willow and W+B by 33%, 57% and 72%, respectively. Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels in lettuce cultivars were substantially higher in the season of 2019 when the climate was cooler and the air humidity was higher, but Na+, K+, and P levels were higher in 2020 when the temperature was somewhat warmer and dryer. Among the lettuce cultivars, Great Lakes lettuce has a greater level of macronutrient content (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+), however, Kobak contained much higher phosphorus (P) content at 301.41 (mg kg (1) DM). Plant biostimulants enhanced the ion ratios of Na+: Ca2+ and Na+: Mg2+, but the only substantial improvement in Ca2+: P ratio was in plants treated with W+B from 2019 to 2021, particularly in the Kobak variety by 20%. Biostimulants, on the other hand, decreased the mass ratio of (K++Na+): (Ca2++Mg2+) in lettuce cultivars. Among plant biostimulants, Willow and the combination of W+B had the highest influence on nutritional absorption and ion ratio, although Bistep had the least. The macronutrient composition and ionic ratios of lettuce cultivars varied according to the cultivar differences and climate conditions. In our 3-year experiments, we discovered that the Great Lakes variety had a higher macronutrient content in the season of 2020, whereas the Kobak variety had a higher ion ratio. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The observation and simulation of lake-air turbulent flux processes have been widely carried out, but studies that examine high-altitude lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are still rare, especially for small lakes. An eddy covariance (EC) system, together with a four-component radiation sensor and instruments for measuring water temperature profiles, was set up in a small lake within the Nam Co basin in April 2012 for long-term evaporation and energy budget observations. With the valuable measurements collected during the ice-free periods in 2012 and 2013, the main conclusions are summarized as follows: First, a bulk aerodynamic transfer model (B model), with parameters optimized for the specific wave pattern in the small lake, could provide reliable and consistent results with EC measurements, and B model simulations are suitable for data interpolation due to inadequate footprint or malfunction of the EC instrument. Second, the total evaporation in this small lake (812mm) is approximately 200mm larger than that from adjacent Nam Co (approximately 627mm) during their ice-free seasons. Third, wind speed shows significance at temporal scales of half hourly, whereas water vapor and temperature gradients have higher correlations over temporal scales of daily and monthly in lake-air turbulent heat exchange. Finally, energy stored during April to June is mainly released during September to November, suggesting an energy balance closure value of 0.97.					; Su, Z./D-4383-2009; Wang, Binbin/GPX-5567-2022; Ma, Weiqiang/AFK-3927-2022	Su, Zhongbo/0000-0003-2096-1733; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				FEB 27	2017	122	4					2289	2303		10.1002/2016JD026109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JD026109													WOS:000396121200015

Characterizing Phosphorus Speciation of Chesapeake Bay Sediments Using Chemical Extraction, 31P NMR, and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient contamination has been one of the lingering issues in the Chesapeake Bay because the bay restoration is complicated by temporally and seasonally variable nutrient sources and complex interaction between imported and regenerated nutrients. Differential reactivity of sedimentary phosphorus (P) pools in response to imposed biogeochemical conditions can record past sediment history and therefore a detailed sediment P speciation may provide information on P cycling particularly the stability of a P pool and the formation of one pool at the expense of another. This study examined sediment P speciation from three sites in the Chesapeake Bay: (i) a North site in the upstream bay, (ii) a middle site in the central bay dominated by seasonally hypoxic bottom water, and (iii) a South site at the bay-ocean boundary using a combination of sequential P extraction (SEDEX) and spectroscopic techniques, including P-31 NMR, P X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and Fe extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Results from sequential P extraction reveal that sediment P is composed predominantly of ferric Fe-bound P and authigenic P, which was further confirmed by solid-state P-31 NMR, XANES, and EXAFS analyses. Additionally, solution P-31 NMR results show that the sediments from the middle site contain high amounts of organic P such as monoesters and diesters, compared to the other two sites, but that these compounds rapidly decrease with sediment depth indicating remineralized P could have precipitated as authigenic P. Fe EXAFS enabled to identify the changes in Fe mineral composition and P sinks in response to imposed redox condition in the middle site sediments. The presence of lepidocrocite, vermiculite, and Fe smectite in the middle site sediments indicates that some ferric Fe minerals can still be present along with pyrite and vivianite, and that ferric Fe-bound P pool can be a major P sink in anoxic sediments. These results provide improved insights into sediment P dynamics, particularly the rapid remineralization of organic P and the stability of Fe minerals and the ferric Fe-bound P pool in anoxic sediments in the Chesapeake Bay.

Estimating nitrate-nitrogen retention in a large constructed wetland using high-frequency, continuous monitoring and hydrologic modeling	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands are an effective edge-of-field conservation practice for reducing agricultural nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) loads, but their removal performance varies with hydrologic conditions and other factors difficult to capture with traditional grab sampling schemes. We quantified NO3-N retention in a large Iowa constructed wetland using high-frequency (15-min) in situ NO3-N sensors and a physically- based hydrologic model that estimated discharge. Monitoring from May-Nov over a 3-yr period (2014-16) indicated the wetland reduced incoming NO3-N concentrations 49% and loads by an estimated 61 kg day-1 (0.48 gm(-2) day(-1) based on wetland area removal). Monthly and seasonal (May-Nov) wetland retention performance were significantly influenced by hydrologic conditions, as NO3-N concentration reductions ranged from 23% in a year that received nearly 50% more seasonal precipitation than average (2016) to 59-65% in years that received average seasonal precipitation (2014-15). On a monthly basis, NO3-N mass retention was highest in Jun when NO3-N loading was highest, while retention efficiency - the percent of the incoming NO3-N load retained by the wetland - was highest in Jul and Aug when water temperature and hydraulic residence time were higher. The high-frequency monitoring captured NO3-N dynamics not possible with lower-frequency sampling. Extrapolating the May-Nov 3-yr average wetland NO3-N retention estimated in this study to a much larger scale, over 5600 wetlands treating more than 60% of Iowa's area and totaling an estimated $1.5 billion in design and construction would be required to reduce the state's baseline NO3-N load by 45%, indicating the sizable investment in wetland construction and restoration needed to achieve Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia water quality goals.

The lack of precipitation observations is a bottleneck for the study of land surface processes in this region. Over the past six years, we have designed and established two observation transects across the south-north and the west-east in this region to obtain hourly rainfall data during the warm season (May-September).

The observation dataset has been applied to clarify the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation in the CWTP, to evaluate the quality of typical gridded precipitation products, to support the development of regional climate models, and to reveal the processes of summertime lake-air interactions.

Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for biological assessment of rivers and lakes in Flanders (Belgium)	LIMNOLOGICA												The European Water Framework Directive requires that member states assess all their surface waters based on a number of biological elements, including macroinvertebrates. Since 1989, the Flemish Environment Agency has been using the Belgian Biotic Index for assessing river water quality based on macroinvertebrates. Throughout the years, the Belgian Biotic Index has proven to be a reliable and robust method providing a good indication of general degradation of river water and habitat quality. Since the Belgian Biotic Index does not meet all the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, a new index, the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for evaluating rivers and lakes was developed and tested. This index was developed in order to provide a general assessment of ecological deterioration caused by any kind of stressor, such as water pollution and habitat quality degradation. The MMIF is based on macroinvertebrate samples that are taken using the same sampling and identification procedure as the Belgian Biotic Index. The index calculation is a type-specific multimetric system based on five equally weighted metrics, which are taxa richness, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, number of other sensitive taxa, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the mean tolerance score. The final index value is expressed as an Ecological Quality Ratio ranging from zero for very bad ecological quality to one for very good ecological quality. The MMIF correlates positively with dissolved oxygen and negatively with Kjeldahl nitrogen, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrite, total phosphorous, orthophosphate and biochemical and chemical oxygen demand. This new index is now being used by the Flemish Environment Agency as a standard method to report about the status of macroinvertebrates in rivers and lakes in Flanders within the context of the European Water Framework Directive.

In Africa, available studies are scarce, and the relevance of this disease paradigm is questionable. Cholera outbreaks have been repeatedly reported far from the coasts: from 2009 through 2011, three-quarters of all cholera cases in Africa occurred in inland regions. Such outbreaks are either influenced by rainfall and subsequent floods or by drought- and water-induced stress. Their concurrence with global climatic events has also been observed. In lakes and rivers, aquatic reservoirs of Vibrio cholerae have been evocated. However, the role of these reservoirs in cholera epidemiology has not been established. Starting from inland cholera-endemic areas, epidemics burst and spread to various environments, including crowded slums and refugee camps. Human displacements constitute a major determinant of this spread.

Climate-driven changes in energy and mass inputs systematically alter nutrient concentration and stoichiometry in deep and shallow regions of Lake Champlain	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in lakes may be differentially impacted by climate-driven changes in nutrient loading and by direct impacts of temperature and wind speed on internal nutrient cycling. Such changes may result in systematic shifts in lake N:P under future climate warming. We used 21 years of monitoring data to compare long-term and intra-annual trends in total N (TN), total P (TP) and TN:TP at 15 sites in Lake Champlain to concurrent measurements of watershed nutrient inputs and meteorological drivers. TN:TP declined sharply lake-wide, particularly in the past decade, yet the drivers of this trend varied based on site depth. In deep sites, declines were driven by changes in watershed loading of dissolved P and N and (in some cases) by decreases in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen. In shallow sites, declines in TN:TP were primarily driven by long-term increases in temperature and decreases in wind speed, and exhibited systematic seasonal variability in TN:TP due to the timing of sediment P loading, N removal processes, and external nutrient inputs. We developed a conceptual model to explain the observed trends, and suggest that while climate drivers have affected nutrient dynamics in shallow and deep sites differently, both deep and shallow sites are likely to experience further declines in N:P and increases in cyanobacteria dominance if recent climate trends continue.

Temperature sensitivity of organic carbon mineralization in contrasting lake sediments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Temperature alone explains a great amount of variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) mineralization. Studies on decomposition of soil OC suggest that (1) temperature sensitivity differs between the fast and slowly decomposition OC and (2) over time, decreasing soil respiration is coupled with increase in temperature sensitivity. In lakes, autochthonous and allochthonous OC sources are generally regarded as fast and slowly decomposing OC, respectively. Lake sediments with different contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous components, however, showed similar temperature sensitivity in short-term incubation experiments. Whether the mineralization of OC in lake sediments dominated by allochthonous or autochthonous OC has different temperature sensitivity in the longer term has not been addressed. We incubated sediments from two boreal lakes that had contrasting OC origin (allochthonous versus autochthonous), and OC characteristics (C/N ratios of 21 and 10) at 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21 degrees C for five months. Compared to soil and litter mineralization, sediment OC mineralization rates were low in spite of low apparent activation energy (E-a). The fraction of the total OC pool that was lost during five months varied between 0.4 and 14.8%. We estimate that the sediment OC pool not becoming long-term preserved was degraded with average apparent turnover times between 3 and 32years. While OC mineralization was strongly dependent on temperature as well as on OC composition and origin, temperature sensitivity was similar across lakes and over time. We suggest that the temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization in lake sediments is similar across systems within the relevant seasonal scales of OC supply and degradation.

Yet most of these studies cover relatively small spatial scales. We assessed the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors in shaping bacterioplankton communities across a >6000km latitudinal range, studying 48 shallow lowland lakes in the tropical, tropicali (isothermal subzone of the tropics) and tundra climate regions of South America using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) differed significantly across regions. Although a large fraction of the variation in BCC remained unexplained, the results supported a consistent significant contribution of local environmental variables and to a lesser extent spatial variables, irrespective of spatial scale. Upon correction for space, mainly biotic environmental factors significantly explained the variation in BCC. The abundance of pelagic cladocerans remained particularly significant, suggesting grazer effects on bacterioplankton communities in the studied lakes. These results confirm that bacterioplankton communities are predominantly structured by environmental factors, even over a large-scale latitudinal gradient (6026km), and stress the importance of including biotic variables in studies that aim to understand patterns in BCC.

Isotopic investigations identified that irrigation return flow is partly responsible for arsenic (As) enrichment through preferential vertical recharge. Further, the floodplain geomorphological attributes and associated As hydrogeochemical behaviour traced through isotopes tracers highlighted that meandering and oxbow like geomorphological features owing to clay deposition leads to the anoxic condition induced reductive microbial dissolution of As-bearing minerals causing the arsenic contamination in the investigated aquifer of the mid-Gangetic plain (MGP). To achieve the objectives, 146 water samples for water chemistry and 62 samples for the isotopic study were collected from Bhojpur district, Bihar (district bounded by the river Ganges in the north and Son in the east) located in MGP during the pre-monsoon season of 2018. The chemical results revealed high arsenic concentration (BDL to 206 mu g.L-1, 32% samples are exceeding the 10 mu g.L-1 limit) in the Holocene recent alluviums which are characterized by various geomorphological features such as meander scars and oxbow lake (northern part of the district). Arsenic is more concentrated in the depth range of 15-40 m below ground surface. All other trace metals viz. Ni, Pb, Zn, Cd and Al were found in low concentration except Fe and Mn. The geochemical analyses suggest that rock-water interaction is controlling the hydro-geochemistry while the chemical constituent of the groundwater is mainly controlled by carbonate weathering with limited contribution from silicate weathering. The isotopic signatures revealed that the Son river is recharging groundwater while the groundwater is contributing to the Ganges river. A clear pattern of fast vertical recharge in the arsenic contaminated area is observed in the proximity to the river Ganges with an elevated nitrate concentration resulted from the reduced As dissolution. The origin of groundwater is local precipitation with low to high evaporation enrichment effect which is further indicating the vertical mixing of groundwater from the irrigation return flow and/or recharge from domestic discharge causing enhanced As mobilization through microbial assisted reductive dissolution of As-bearing minerals.

Mapping surface temperature in a hyper-saline lake and investigating the effect of temperature distribution on the lake evaporation	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing is an effective tool for capturing spatial and temporal variations of water surface temperature (WST) in large lakes. The WST of Urmia Lake in northwestern Iran was examined from 2007 to 2010, using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products. Spatial and temporal (diurnal, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual) variations of Urmia Lake WST were also investigated. Results indicate that the MODIS-derived WSTs are in a good agreement with the in situ data (R-2 = 0.92 and bias = -0.27). Spatial analysis of WST revealed that there are three thermal zones along the lake: the shallow region in barriers of the causeway, islands and the shoreline; the south part; and the deep north parts. Using validated MODIS-derived WST, the annual temperature cycles of Urmia Lake were extracted and quadratic curves were fitted to empirically display the monthly lake-averaged variations of the lake WST. Then the effect of including the spatial distribution of WST on the lake evaporation was assessed. According to the results of the energy balance method, a 147 mm/year (515 million m(3)) discrepancy can be expected in the estimated evaporation rate when the spatial distribution in the lake WST is considered in the energy balance equation. Findings of this study confirm the application of MODIS LST products for surface temperature studies in a large hyper-saline lake. Moreover, use of the distributed satellite-derived WST in estimating evaporation from the lake was shown to improve the accuracy of water loss in the lake water budget calculation.

In addition, the study showes a relationship between the seasonal, spatial distribution and the amount of microplastics found. This study was conducted in 35 fish farms located in the Rondo<SIC>nia state, Brazil, the sample collects were carried out in the two Amazonian hydrological seasons (dry and rainy). The study was developed in a completely randomized factorial scheme 35 x 3 x 3 (35 fish farms, 3 ponds and 3 repetitions per ponds). Microplastic sampling was performed following a modified method based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Samples of 250 mL freshwater collected, which were deionized and pre-filtered through 6.0 mm mesh granulometric sieves. The average abundances of the different hydrological seasons were compared by Student's t-test, with differences statistically significant at p < 0.05. The microplastics were morphological categorized into fibers and colors blue, red or transparent. Microplastic contamination was confirmed in freshwater of 9 fish farming, with greater abundance of blue fibers and greater quantification in the rainy season. Fish farms P3, P4 and P6 had the highest quantifications of blue fiber in the two seasons (6 and 43, 19 and 56, 11 and 88 items mL-1, respectively). Almost all fish farms had a higher abundance of microplastics in the rainy season. It is important to highlight the prominence of microplastics in the blue fiber rainy season (286 items mL-1) compared to the dry season (58 items mL-1). Fish farms P3, P4 and P6 showed a strong positive correlation between the factors distance from the nearest urban area (r = 0.94, 0.79 and 0.97, respectively) and seasonality (r = 0.98, 0.77 and 0.96, respectively). Rainfall variations influenced the abundance of microplastics, especially of blue fibers. Fish farms are supplied with fresh water by rivers or streams, so it is possible that microplastics originate outside the fish farm, perhaps they were introduced due to high soil occupation, although surface runoff (of water contaminated by sewage) caused by heavy rains the most important factor. Therefore, one factor must be considered, surface runoff and groundwater contaminated by urban, agricultural and urban effluents may have contaminated rivers and streams and then contaminated the water in the fish farm ponds.

In this study, we used phytoplankton dynamic datasets in the eutrophic Fenhe River to show the variations and drivers of phytoplankton abundance under complex, fluctuating environmental conditions during 2012-2017. The temporal and spatial variations of nutrients in the river depicted that the total phosphorus (TP) concentration was higher in the wet season and in downstream. There were increases in total nitrogen (TN) concentration in the normal season and in upstream. The structural equation model (SEM) showed that the phytoplankton abundance increased during the wet season despite the decrease in the TN:TP ratio and was reduced upstream due to the highest TN:TP ratio. Among the environmental variables, water temperature (WT) was an important predictor and positively correlated temporally and spatially to phytoplankton. The interaction of nutrients with the phytoplankton community at different temperature levels indicated that different phytoplankton groups have different nutrient requirements. We can conclude that enhances in temperature and TP concentration will significantly increase phytoplankton abundance and dominance of cyanobacteria and green algae in the future, whereas there was insignificant effect on diatoms. These data indicated that temperature and TP content were the important abiotic factors influencing the phytoplankton growth of the water body, which could provide a reference for the evaluation of environmental alterations in the future.

However, the carbon sequestration potential of flooded wetlands may be weakened owing to water regime changes induced by anthropogenic disturbances. Using the eddy covariance technique, this study quantified the effects of the water level and vegetation types on the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco) from a reed marsh (Miscanthus sacchariflorus) and a sedge meadow (Carex spp.) in the Dongting Lake floodplain from 2014 to 2016. Our results indicated that the sedge meadow (-89.49 to -186.47 g C m- 2 y-1) and reed marsh (-246.12 to -513.94 g C m- 2 y-1) were carbon sinks on the interannual timescale. However, the sedge meadow changed from a carbon sink to a carbon source during the flooding season. The effect of flooding on the carbon sink function in the reed marsh was dependent on the water level. The carbon sink function of the reed marsh was enhanced by moderate flooding (water level under 30.5 m in Chenglingji) owing to the inhibition of Reco, but was weakened by extremely high-water levels (over 33 m in Chenglingji) during the flooding season. Seasonal variations in NEE, GPP, and Reco were closely related to photosynthetic photon flux density, soil water content, water level, soil temperature, and air temperature. We can conclude that the increase in reed area combined with the decrease in flooding days in the sedge meadow can potentially enhance the carbon sink function of the Dongting Lake floodplain.

Seagrass and macrophyte mediated CO2 and CH4 dynamics in shallow coastal waters	PLOS ONE												Seagrass meadows are among the most important coastal/marine ecosystems for long-term carbon storage and conditioning of coastal waters. A combined air-water flux of CO2 and CH4 from the seagrass meadows was studied for the first time from Asia's largest brackish-water lagoon, Chilika, India. Ecosystem-based comparisons were carried out during two hydrologically different conditions of dry and wet seasons in the seagrass dominated southern sector (SS); macrophyte-dominated northern sector (NS); the largely un-vegetated central sector (CS) and the tidally active outer channel (OC) of the lagoon. The mean fluxes of CO2 from SS, NS, CS and OC were 9.8, 146.6, 48.4 and 33.0mM m(-2)d(-1), and that of CH4 were 0.12, 0.11, 0.05 and 0.07mM m(-2)d(-1), respectively. The net emissions (in terms of CO2 equivalents), considering the global warming potential of CO2 (GWP: 1) and CH4 (GWP: 28) from seagrass meadows were over 14 times lower compared to the macrophyte-dominated sector of the lagoon. Contrasting emissivity characteristics of CO2 and CH4 were observed between macrophytes and seagrass, with the former being a persistent source of CO2. It is inferred that although seagrass meadows act as a weak source of CH4, they could be effective sinks of CO2 if land-based pollution sources are minimized.					; Ramachandran, Ramesh/B-4814-2018; Singh, Gurmeet/ABB-7636-2020; Ganguly, Dipnarayan/J-4191-2014; Singh, Gurmeet/D-4052-2012; Ramachandran, Purvaja/K-5522-2018	Ramachandran, Ramesh/0000-0003-2471-7746; Ganguly, Dipnarayan/0000-0003-0016-7145; BANERJEE, KAKOLEE/0000-0002-1260-8369; Singh, Gurmeet/0000-0002-1641-5070; 													1932-6203					OCT 8	2018	13	10							e0203922	10.1371/journal.pone.0203922	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203922								30296285					WOS:000446632700009

The 1.03 m sediment profile of Wadhwana Lake shows five paleoclimatic phases. The study reveals high lake stand during Phase I (similar to 7500-5560 cal yr BP). A considerable cool and moist climatic condition during Phase I is inferred due to the presence of pollen belonging to wet evergreen taxa and high phytolith climatic index 'lc'. Later part of Phase I show gradual replacement of evergreen to deciduous pollen taxa, decrease in Ic value and dominance of smectite over kaolinite, indicating a reduction in wet climatic condition due to decline in the precipitation and prevalence of seasonally dry climate. However, a large variety of Madhuca, Meliaceae, Asteraceae pollen taxa, abundant fresh-water algae Chrozophora and Ceralia pollen in this period provides evidence of intensified arboriculture and agricultural activity. Low lake level and dry climate have been documented during Phase II (5560 to similar to 4255 cal yr BP) and are synchronous with the lake records of western Indian region. High values of phytolith aridity index Iph, high primary minerals, increase in the delta C-13 values provide evidence for excessive dry climatic conditions at similar to 4255 cal yr BP. Phase III shows a gradual strengthening of SW monsoon after similar to 3500 cal yr BP. Phase IV shows a short pulse of dry climatic conditions (similar to 3238 to similar to 2709 cal yr BP) followed by somewhat similar to present day climate for Phase V. The study concludes that onset of dry climate after 5500 cal yr BP is a regionally spread synchronous event that has been documented in several lake records of western India. It is surmised that the urbanization in Harappan civilization in North West India was coincident with the initial phase of declining rainfall of mid-Holocene. The emergence of cultural complexity of Harappan civilization should be seen as an initial adaptation to earliest phase of environmental deterioration and its subsequent decline is probably linked with the changing seasonality pattern and excessive dry climate of later phase (similar to 4200-4255 cal yr BP) of mid-Holocene.

Water diversion can affect the biogeochemical cycles, however, carbon dioxide (CO2) sensitivity in lakes to water diversion was poorly understood. This study addressed the issue based on the famous Water Diversion project from the Yangtze River to eutrophic Lake Taihu, which has been carried out regularly since 2002 in China. The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) at two regions of the eutrophic lake, water-receiving Gonghu Bay and non-water-receiving Central Zone, was investigated over 16 years (2002-2017) field measurement with high sampling frequency. Results showed the river-to-lake water diversion decreased phytoplankton biomass, increased nutrient loadings, and significantly elevated the pCO(2) and associated CO2 emission. Meanwhile, the water diversion project accounted for the notable CO2 spatial heterogeneity between regions and within region. However, weak CO2 seasonal variability was observed at Gonghu Bay during water diversion period. The estimated CO2 emission flux increased averagely by 54% due to water diversion, primarily resulting from phytoplankton dilution, nutrient enrichment, and external CO2 input. Water diversion and ammonia nitrogen together explained 69% of interannual variability pCO(2) at Gonghu Bay, implying water diversion should be considered to better understanding the contribution of lake CO2 emissions to C budget under a changing environment. These findings were expected to serve as a reference to evaluate the water diversion effects, further study should focus on the sources of the excess CO2 to make the project a CO2-neutral option.

In deep, stratified lakes, eutrophication-induced hypolimnetic anoxia often stimulates the release of labile P from the sediment into the water column. This positive feedback, termed internal P loading, maintains or even accelerates eutrophication. However, most studies on internal P loading have focused on recent times. Little is known about whether such positive feedbacks caused by labile P release from sediments also played a role under natural conditions with little or no human impact. We investigated a high-resolution 15,000-year sediment record of paleoproduction, anoxia, and five sedimentary P fractions from a small, deep lake, Soppensee, on the Swiss Central Plateau. We estimated long-term qualitative internal P loading by comparing the Holocene record of diatom-inferred epilimnetic total P (DI-TP) concentrations with labile P fraction (Fe-P) concentrations in sediments under changing trophic state, redox, and lake mixing regimes. Intensified P cycling from sediments into the water column (enhanced internal P loading) apparently occurred as a positive feedback to natural eutrophication with persistent bottom-water anoxia during the early to midHolocene (-9000-6000 cal BP). However, this positive feedback was not inferred for other eutrophic phases. Fe-rich layers formed during seasonal mixing of the lake in the late Holocene (-2000-200 cal BP) and magnetitetype minerals produced by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) internal P loading during anoxic phases in the mid- to late Holocene (-6000-2000 cal BP) appeared to prevent internal P loading. MTB presence resulted in high concentrations of potentially labile Fe-P in sediments. Our study demonstrates the potential contribution of internal P loading during long-term natural eutrophication of deep stratified lakes and has wide implications for lake management and restoration. Our results highlight the importance of the coupled geochemical cycles of P and Fe in the long-term trophic state evolution of stratified, ferruginous, low-sulfate-water lakes, conditions that have been reported to serve as analogs for the Archaean Ocean.					; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014	Tu, Luyao/0000-0001-9593-556X; Moyle, Madeleine/0000-0002-7661-598X; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				DEC	2021	207								103643	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103643		OCT 2021											WOS:000711096800001

Here, we demonstrate these physical processes in Lake Erie through extensive field data analysis and high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling. The validated model successfully reproduces dominant physical processes in the offshore and nearshore waters including surface seiches (similar to 14 h), near-inertial waves (similar to 17 h) and upwelling events (5-10 days). We show that upwelling events are the predominant nearshore physical processes, and are energized when winds accelerate the epilimnetic waters to the south, causing the thermocline front to move up into the north shore. After the wind subsides, the elevated thermoclines simultaneously form two separate cyclonically propagating internal Kelvin waves in the central and the eastern basins following by two coastal jets at phase speeds of 0.22 ms(-1) and 037 ms(-1) within 5-15 km off the shoreline, respectively. The predominant south-west winds limit the presence of Kelvin waves only to the northern parts of each basin, where the bathymetry allows, and disappear when shoreline morphology no longer maintain these waves due to nonzero cross-shore transports at the coastal boundary layer. Intrusions of hypolimnetic waters through upwelling events contribute 10-30% to the net cross-shore transport, and are most pronounced in May and June when the offshore thermocline is shallow. The intermittent strong westward nearshore currents by Kelvin waves are in the opposite direction of seasonal eastward currents.

T.; Sommer, Regina; Farnleitner, Andreas H.; Blaschke, Alfred Paul			Spatiotemporal resolved sampling for the interpretation o micropollutant removal during riverbank filtration	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Riverbank filtration (RBF) systems along rivers are widely used as public water supplies. In these systems, many organic micropollutants (OMPs) are attenuated, but some compounds have shown to be rather persistent. Their fate and transport has been studied in RBF sites along lakes and small rivers, but not extensively along large and dynamic rivers. Therefore, the influence of flood events on OMP behavior in these large and dynamic RBF sites was investigated. Monthly samples were taken from surface- and groundwater up to a distance of 900 m from the riverbank of the Danube from March 2014 till May 2016. Two flood events were sampled more extensively nearby the river. Results showed that changes in flow conditions in the river not only caused changes in OMP concentrations, but also in their load. It was seen that the load of benzotriazole, carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in the river increased with increasing river discharges. After a relatively long, oxic groundwater passage, several OMPs were reduced. In contrast to previous work, we found that benzotriazole was almost fully removed under oxic conditions. When entering the aquifer, benzotriazole concentrations were significantly reduced and at a distance of 550 m from the river, >97% was degraded. Carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole showed relatively persistent behavior in the aquifer. The concentrations measured during flood events were in the same range as seasonal sampling. Furthermore concentrations in the groundwater were higher during these events than in the Danube and can reach further into the aquifer. During flood events some highly degradable compounds (i.e. didofenac) were found up to a distance of 24 m from the river. These results implied that drinking water utilities with RBF wells in oxic, alluvial aquifers located close to highly dynamic rivers need to consider a potential reduction in groundwater quality during and directly after flood events.

The mission of CAAT is to provide leadership for a regional alliance of two-year colleges, school districts, and universities, working in collaboration with industry, professional associations and government agencies, to prepare a 21st century technical workforce for the design, development, manufacturing, service and recycling sectors of the advanced automotive industry. The CAAT focuses on Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin and will expand its reach within the Great Lakes region. It aims to meet the growing and evolving advanced technical education needs of current and future technical workers in the automotive industry, a critically important industry across the U. S. and the prominent employer in our region. The identification of emerging automotive technologies -Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEC), Electric Vehicles (EV) and derivatives -enables a vision designed to focus curricular efforts on the areas that will properly describe key relevant technologies and provide adequate flexibility to include new technologies yet to be developed. As a model for educating automotive technicians and technologists, CAAT provides leadership and coordination of curricular reform of automotive technician education programs, integrate advanced automotive technology skills, and emphasize Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education at the secondary and postsecondary levels in our region and other areas in the U. S. with similar needs for newly skilled automotive technicians in a transformed automotive industry. CAAT also serves as a clearinghouse of educational materials and methods related to advanced automotive technology for partners and other interested institutions and individuals. The CAAT is a cooperative effort of education, industry and government to create a regional resource for advanced automotive technologies across the lifetime learning continuum. The two major educational partners are Macomb Community College (MCC) in Warren, Michigan, and Wayne State University (WSU) in Detroit, Michigan. Other key partners include the Southeast Michigan Community College Consortium (SMC3), the Macomb Intermediate School District (MISD), the Michigan Academy for Green Mobility Alliance (MAGMA), the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). SMC3 is a consortium of nine community colleges in Southeast Michigan that have joined forces to expand the capability of each to deliver shared programs. MISD is CAAT's key partner in reform of the K-12 curriculum, and a state leader in reform efforts for career technical education. MAGMA, formed by Michigan Workforce Development Agency, Michigan Department of Labor, Energy and Economic Growth (DELEG), educational institutions and more than thirty automotive manufacturing employers, is a state supported response to industry requests to increase the local workforce capable of helping create the hybrid and electric vehicles of the future. CAR is the nation's leading provider of economic research for the auto industry, and SAE International, having life-long learning as the core competency, is a global association of automotive engineers and related technical experts. In order to promote awareness of advanced automotive technologies to diverse audiences, CAAT also includes Excel Institute in Washington DC in the program, and collaborates with the NSF funded Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program and the state funded King-Chavez-Parks Initiative University Bound Program. The MCC-WSU partnership was awarded the NSF-ATE grant (UDE 1003032) in June 2010 for establishing the CAAT. The center office and a branch office have been set up in Macomb Community College South Campus and the Division of Engineering Technology at Wayne State University, respectively. Prior to receiving this grant, MCC and WSU have implemented a planning grant (DUE 0802135) to investigate automotive workforce needs, automotive education core competencies, existing automotive education curriculum/ pedagogy and advanced automotive future trends, and to select educational and industry partners. This paper describes the rationale of creating an ATE center for advanced automotive technology, the finding of the planning grant, the CAAT goals and objectives, and the center activities, including educational material collection and dissemination, a seed funding program, student summer academies, and faculty professional development.																			2153-5965						2012																								WOS:000380253703061

Two model FeRB species, Shewanella and Geobacter, have been intensively studied because of their functions in bioremediation, iron reduction, and bioelectricity production. However, the abundance and community diversity of Shewanella and Geobacter in eutrophic freshwater lakes remain largely unknown. In this work, the distribution, abundance and biodiversity of Shewanella, Geobacter and other FeRB in the sediments of a heavily polluted lake, Chaohu Lake, China, across four successive seasons were investigated. Shewanella, Geobacter, and other FeRB were found to be widely distributed in the sediment of this heavily eutrophic lake. Geobacter was abundant with at least one order of magnitude more than Shewanella in cold seasons. Three Shewanella-related operational taxonomic units were detected and sixty one Geobacter-related operational taxonomic units were grouped into three phylogenetic clades. Thiobacillus, Desulfuromonas and Geobacter were identified as the main members of FeRB in the lake sediments. Interestingly, nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were found to be the key factors governing the abundance and diversity of FeRB. Total FeRB, as well as Geobacter and Shewanella, were more abundant in the heavily eutrophic zone than those in the lightly eutrophic zone. The abundance and diversity of FeRB in the sediments of freshwater lakes were highly related with the degree of eutrophication, which imply that FeRB might have a great potential in alleviating the eutrophication and contamination in aqueous environments.					; Cheng, Yuan-Yuan/CAG-5609-2022; Yu, Han-Qing/F-7925-2010	Liu, Dong-Feng/0000-0003-4782-0033; 													0175-7598	1432-0614				DEC	2018	102	24					10791	10801		10.1007/s00253-018-9443-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9443-1								30334090					WOS:000451523800035

Floodpath lakes and wetlands are the lakes and associated wetlands affected by seasonal variations of water level and water surface area. Floodpath lakes and wetlands are, in particular, sensitive to natural and anthropogenic impacts, such as climate change, human-induced intervention on hydrological regimes, and land use and land cover change. Rapid developments of remote sensing science and technologies, provide immense opportunities and capacities to improve our understanding of the changing lake and wetland environments. This special issue on Remote Sensing of Floodpath Lakes and Wetlands comprise featured articles reporting the latest innovative research and reflects the advancement in remote sensing applications on the theme topic. In this editorial paper, we review research developments using state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies for monitoring dynamics of floodpath lakes and wetlands; discuss challenges of remote sensing in inventory, monitoring, management, and governance of floodpath lakes and wetlands; and summarize the highlights of the articles published in this special issue.																				2072-4292				DEC	2018	10	12							1955	10.3390/rs10121955	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10121955													WOS:000455637600097
J	Vinnå, LR; Wüest, A; Bouffard, D				Vinna, Love Raman; Wuest, Alfred; Bouffard, Damien			Physical effects of thermal pollution in lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Anthropogenic heat emissions into inland waters influence water temperature and affect stratification, heat and nutrient fluxes, deep water renewal, and biota. Given the increased thermal stress on these systems by growing cooling demands of riparian/coastal infrastructures in combination with climate warming, the question arises on how to best monitor and manage these systems. In this study, we investigate local and system-wide physical effects on the medium-sized perialpine Lake Biel (Switzerland), influenced by point-source cooling water emission from an upstream nuclear power plant (heat emission approximate to 700 MW, approximate to 18 W m(-2) lake wide). We use one-dimensional (SIMSTRAT) and three-dimensional (Delft3D-Flow) hydrodynamic numerical simulations and provide model resolution guidelines for future studies of thermal pollution. The effects on Lake Biel by the emitted excess heat are summarized as: (i) clear seasonal trend in temperature increase, locally up to 3.4 degrees C and system-wide volume mean approximate to 0.3 degrees C, which corresponds to one decade of regional surface water climate warming; (ii) the majority of supplied thermal pollution (approximate to 60%) leaves this short residence time (approximate to 58 days) system via the main outlet, whereas the remaining heat exits to the atmosphere; (iii) increased length of stratified period due to the stabilizing effects of additional heat; (iv) system-wide effects such as warmer temperature, prolonged stratified period, and river-caused epilimnion flushing are resolved by both models whereas local raised temperature and river short circuiting was only identifiable with the three-dimensional model approach. This model-based method provides an ideal tool to assess man-made impacts on lakes and their downstream outflows.					; Wuest, Alfred/L-2607-2014	Raman Vinna, Love/0000-0002-9108-8057; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAY	2017	53	5					3968	3987		10.1002/2016WR019686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019686													WOS:000403712100027

In these settings, mobility among women is high and may contribute to increased risk of HIV infection and poor access to effective prevention and treatment services. Understanding the nature and patterns of this mobility is important for the design of interventions. We conducted an exploratory study to understand the nature and patterns of women's mobility to inform the design of HIV intervention trials in fishing communities of Lake Victoria.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional formative qualitative study conducted in six purposively selected fishing communities in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Potential participants were screened for eligibility on age (18+ years) and having stayed in the fishing community for more than 6 months. We collected data using introductory and focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews with key informants. Data focused on: history and patterns of mobility, migration in and out of fishing communities and the relationship between mobility and HIV infection. Since the interviews and discussions were not audio-recorded, detailed notes were taken and written up into full scripts for analysis. We conducted a thematic analysis using constant comparison analysis.ResultsParticipants reported that women in fishing communities were highly mobile for work-related activities. Overall, we categorized mobility as travels over long and short distances or periods depending on the kind of livelihood activity women were involved in. Participants reported that women often travelled to new places, away from familiar contacts and far from healthcare access. Some women were reported to engage in high risk sexual behaviour and disengaging from HIV care. However, participants reported that women often returned to the fishing communities they considered home, or followed a seasonal pattern of work, which would facilitate contact with service providers.ConclusionWomen exhibited circular and seasonal mobility patterns over varying distances and duration away from their home communities. These mobility patterns may limit women's access to trial/health services and put them at risk of HIV-infection. Interventions should be tailored to take into account mobility patterns of seasonal work observed in this study.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to estimate the quantity and contribution of metabolically active at the single-cell level bacteria in the microbial community in peat-bog lakes. To determine different aspects of the metabolic activity of bacteria, four fluorescent staining methods (Dehydrogenase/Electron Transport System Activity-CTC+, Nucleoid Containing Cells- NuCC+, Active Bacteria with Intact Ribosome Structures- RIB+ and Active Bacteria With an Intact Membrane MEM+) were applied. We identified four natural peat-bog lakes in Northern Europe to determine which factors community (bacterial factors) or environment (hydrochemical and physical factors) have a significant influence on the quantitative dynamics of metabolically active microorganisms, in terms of seasonal and habitat changes. The results show that change in the amount of abiotic components such as DOC, TN, and TOC can result in stress, which may limit a function but does not lead to losing all other metabolic functions in the community-forming bacteria. In nutrient-poor peat bog lakes, nutrients and organic carbon are factors which regulate the overall activity of the community.

Phosphorus speciation in a eutrophic lake by 31P NMR spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												For eutrophic lakes, patterns of phosphorus (P) measured by standard methods are well documented but provide little information about the components comprising standard operational definitions. Dissolved P (DP) and particulate P (PP) represents important but rarely characterized nutrient pools. Samples from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA were characterized using 31-phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) during the open water season of 2011 in this unmatched temporal study of aquatic P dynamics. A suite of organic and inorganic P forms was detected in both dissolved and particulate fractions: orthophosphate, orthophosphate monoesters, orthophosphate diesters, pyrophosphate, polyphosphate, and phosphonates. Through time, phytoplankton biomass, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water clarity were correlated with changes in the relative proportion of P fractions. Particulate P can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton-bound P, and in this study, a high proportion of polyphosphate within particulate samples suggested P should not be a limiting factor for the dominant primary producers, cyanobacteria. Hypolimnetic particulate P samples were more variable in composition than surface samples, potentially due to varying production and transport of sinking particles. Surface dissolved samples contained less P than particulate samples, and were typically dominated by orthophosphate, but also contained monoester, diester, polyphosphate, pyrophosphate, and phosphonate. Hydrologic inflows to the lake contained more orthophosphate and orthophosphate monoesters than in-lake samples, indicating transformation of P from inflowing waters. This time series explores trends of a highly regulated nutrient in the context of other water quality metrics (chlorophyll, mixing regime, and clarity), and gives insight on the variability of the structure and occurrence of P-containing compounds in light of the phosphorus-limited paradigm.

Such fluctuation is believed associated with the state shifts of bacterial community within. To date, seasonality effects on bacterioplankton community patterns in large rivers serving as drinking water sources however, are still poorly understood. Here we investigated the intra-annual bacterial community structure in the Dongjiang River, a drinking water source of Hong Kong, using high-throughput pyrosequencing in concert with geochemical property measurements during dry, and wet seasons. Our results showed that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla of bacterioplankton communities, which varied in composition, and distribution from dry to wet seasons, and exhibited profound seasonal changes. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria seemed to be more associated with seasonality that the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were significantly higher in the dry season than those in the wet season (p < 0.01), while the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria was about 10-fold higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Temperature and NO3--N concentration represented key contributing factors to the observed seasonal variations. These findings help understand the roles of various bacterioplankton and their interactions with the biogeochemical processes in the river ecosystem.

To fill this research gap, we studied phytoplankton taxonomic and functional composition and their relationships with water quality, habitat, climate, and land use across 30 river sections in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River during 2017-2018.ResultsMajor observed phytoplankton groups were cyanobacteria, bacillariophyta, and chlorophyta. Phytoplankton total abundance, total biomass, and species richness significantly decreased in the dry season compared to the wet season, with the species and functional composition differing significantly between seasons. Phytoplankton species differences between seasons were mainly contributed by Oscillatoria sp., Pseudanabaena sp., and Melosira granulata. The dfferences in phytoplankton functional groups between seasons were mainly contributed by P (including Closterium sp., Melosira sp.), Lo (including Merismopedia sp., Peridinium sp., Ceratium sp., and Gymnodinium sp.), and J (including Pediastrum sp., Tetraedron sp., Crucigenia sp., Scenedesmus sp., and Coelastrum sp.). The variance partitioning showed that water quality (NO3-N, total suspended solids, turbidity) and habitat (water flow, river bank and river channel conditions) were critical factors in shaping phytoplankton patterns, followed by climate and land use.ConclusionsResults indicated that there was significant seasonal variation of phytoplankton in the Yangtze River, with water quality and habitat primarily driving phytoplankton patterns. Our study contributes to the understanding of natural and anthropogenic factors that drive seasonal successional processes of phytoplankton in the Yangtze River. These findings have important implications for environmental management as well as towards the ecological restoration of large rivers.

The contact zone between a lake and a river can act as a barrier, where inflowing matter is accumulated and transformed. Magnesium and calcium are natural components of surface water, and their concentrations can be shaped by various factors, mostly the geological structure of a catchment area, soil class and type, plant cover, weather conditions (precipitation-evaporation, seasonal variations), land relief, type and intensity of water supply (surface runoffs and groundwater inflows), etc. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of a river-lake system on magnesium and calcium concentrations in surface water (inflows, lake, outflow) and their accumulation in bottom deposits. The study was performed between March 2011 and May 2014 in a river-lake system comprising Lake Symsar with inflows, lying in the Olsztyn Lakeland region. The study revealed that calcium and magnesium were retained in the water column and the bottom deposits of the lake at 12.75 t Mg year(-1) and 1.97 t Ca year(-1). On average, 12.7 +/- 1.2 g of calcium and 1.77 +/- 0.9 g of magnesium accumulated in 1 kg of bottom deposits in Lake Symsar. The river-lake system, which received pollutants from an agricultural catchment, influenced the Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the water and the bottom deposits of Lake Symsar. The Tolknicka Struga drainage canal, to which incompletely treated municipal wastewater was discharged, also affected Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels, thus indicating the significant influence of anthropogenic factors.					; Kuriata-Potasznik, Angela/U-3449-2018	Szymczyk, Slawomir/0000-0001-8845-2594; Kuriata-Potasznik, Angela/0000-0001-9836-124X													1644-2296					SEP	2015	20	3					677	692		10.5601/jelem.2015.20.1.788	http://dx.doi.org/10.5601/jelem.2015.20.1.788													WOS:000359961500012

Moreover, the ice significantly affects the level and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the water column. We utilized spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to analyze the molecular composition and distribution of DOM in ice cores and under-ice water in Daihai Lake. We identified the main environmental factors affecting DOM migration through structural equation modelling (SEM). The freezing process created a repulsive effect on DOM, with water samples demonstrating a greater DOM content than ice. The dominant part of the DOM in the ice cores was mainly comprised of protein-like materials (71.45 %), whereas water consisted of humus-like materials (54.81 %). The average molecular weight of the ice cover DOM (m/z = 396.77) was smaller than in the under-ice water (m/z = 405.42). While low-molecular and low-aromatic protein-like material tended to be trapped in the ice layer during ice formation, large-molecular and highly aromatic humic substances were more easily expelled into the water. Interestingly, condensed aromatic hydrocarbons were found to occur less frequently in the ice phase (11 %) compared to the aqueous phase (13 %). Both the lipid and protein/aliphatic compound structures exhibited slightly higher ratios in the ice (6 % and 8 %, respectively) than in water (1 % and 5 %, respectively). SEM between the ice cover environment and DOM indicated that the ice can influence the distribution pattern of DOM through the regulation of internal solute factors and other chemicals. The nature of the DOM and the rate of ice growth also play critical roles in determining the distribution mechanism of DOM for ice and water. The pollutant distribution characteristics and migration patterns between ice and water are essential for comprehending environmental water pollution and promoting pollution management and protection measures in cold region lakes.

Disconnect of microbial structure and function: enzyme activities and bacterial communities in nascent stream corridors	ISME JOURNAL												A fundamental issue in microbial and general ecology is the question to what extent environmental conditions dictate the structure of communities and the linkages with functional properties of ecosystems (that is, ecosystem function). We approached this question by taking advantage of environmental gradients established in soil and sediments of small stream corridors in a recently created, early successional catchment. Specifically, we determined spatial and temporal patterns of bacterial community structure and their linkages with potential microbial enzyme activities along the hydrological flow paths of the catchment. Soil and sediments were sampled in a total of 15 sites on four occasions spread throughout a year. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to characterize bacterial communities, and substrate analogs linked to fluorescent molecules served to track 10 different enzymes as specific measures of ecosystem function. Potential enzyme activities varied little among sites, despite contrasting environmental conditions, especially in terms of water availability. Temporal changes, in contrast, were pronounced and remarkably variable among the enzymes tested. This suggests much greater importance of temporal dynamics than spatial heterogeneity in affecting specific ecosystem functions. Most strikingly, bacterial community structure revealed neither temporal nor spatial patterns. The resulting disconnect between bacterial community structure and potential enzyme activities indicates high functional redundancy within microbial communities even in the physically and biologically simplified stream corridors of early successional landscapes.

Lakes play an important role in the terrestrial water cycle and biogeochemical cycle and substantially influence the health of humans living in the surrounding areas. Given the importance of lakes in the ecosystem, long-term monitoring of dynamic changes has important theoretical and practical significance. Here, we extracted water body information and monitored the long-term dynamics of Bosten Lake, which is the largest inland lake in China. We quantified the meteorological factors of the study area from the observation data of meteorological stations between 1988 and 2018. The characteristics of climate change and its correlation with the change of area in the Bosten Lake Basin in the past 30 years were analyzed. The major contributions of this study are as follows: (1) The initial water body was segmented based on the water index model Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) with a pre-assigned threshold value. The results were evaluated with the area extracted through artificial visual interpretation. Then we conducted mathematical morphology operators, opening and closing operations, and median filter to eliminate noise to ensure the accuracy of water body information extraction from the Bosten Lake. A long-term water surface area database of the Bosten Lake was established from high-resolution remote sensing images during 1988-2018. (2) Due to the seasonal difference of snow, ice content, and other objects on images, the areadynamics of Bosten Lake in the recent 30 years were analyzed separately in dry season and rainy season. The water surface area of Bosten Lake showed large inter-annual variations between 1988-2018. (3) Based on the assumption that climatic change has more direct effects on lake than human activities, six meteorological factors were selected to analyze the impacts of climate change on the annual mean lake surface area. The result indicated that in the past 30 years, climate conditions in the Bosten Lake Basin fluctuated greatly. We conducted correlations analysis between the areal dynamics of the Bosten Lake and the meteorological factors. Here, the annual average evaporation had the highest correlation with the areal dynamics of Bosten Lake followed by air temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours, and relative humidity, while the annual average wind speed had the weakest correlation.					dai, Xiaoai/KJM-0593-2024; Meilian, Wang/KPB-1539-2024	, Xiaoai/0000-0003-1342-6417; wang, meilian/0000-0003-3854-9755; 														2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							4	10.3390/w12010004	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010004													WOS:000519847200004

Schistosomiasis in the Philippines: Innovative Control Approach is Needed if Elimination is the Goal	TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE												In 1996, schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma japonicum was declared eradicated in Japan. In the People's Republic of China, S. japonicum transmission has been interrupted in the major endemic areas in the coastal plains but the disease persists in the lake and marshland regions south of the Yangtze River. The disease remains a public health problem in endemic areas in the Philippines and in isolated areas in Indonesia. Comprehensive multidisciplinary campaigns had led to eradication of schistosomiasis in Japan and have been successful in the interruption of disease transmission in the major endemic regions of the People's Republic of China. Unfortunately, the integrated measures cannot be duplicated in schistosomiasis endemic areas in the Philippines because of limited resources. The problem is also more complicated due to the topography in the Philippines and transmission is not seasonal as in China. An innovative approach is needed in the Philippines if schistosomiasis elimination is the goal.

Therefore, we designed a field experiment in an intensive rice-wheat cropping system located in the Taihu Lake region of China and measured CH4 and N2O emissions for 2 consecutive years to examine the impacts of biochar combined with N-fertilizer on rice production and GHG flux. Three field experimental treatments were designed: (1) no N-fertilizer application (N0); (2) 270 kg N ha(-1) application (N270); and (3) 270 kg N-fertilizer ha(-1) plus 25 t ha(-1) biochar application (N270 + C). We found that, compared with urea application alone, biochar applied with Urea-N fertilizer increased N use efficiency (NUE) and resulted in more stable growth of rice yield. In addition, biochar addition increased CH4 emissions by 0.5-37.5% on average during the two consecutive rice-growing seasons, and decreased N2O-N loss by similar to 16.7%. During the first growing season, biochar addition did not significantly affect the global warming potential (GWPt) or the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of rice production (p > 0.05). By contrast, during the second rice-growing season, biochar application significantly increased GWPt and GHGI by 28.9% and 18.8%, respectively, mainly because of increased CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that biochar amendment could improve grain yields and NUE, and increased soil GWPt, resulting in a higher potential environmental cost, but that biochar additions enhance exogenous carbon sequestration by the soil, which could offset the increases in GHG emissions.

There is little empirical evidence of these processes for East Africa. We collected a unique 2 year high-resolution data set to assess the effects of land use (i.e., natural forest, smallholder agriculture and commercial tea plantations) on NO3-N dynamics in three subcatchments within a headwater catchment in the Mau Forest Complex, Kenya's largest tropical montane forest. The natural forest subcatchment had the lowest NO3-N concentrations (0.44 +/- 0.043 mg N L-1) with no seasonal variation. NO3-N concentrations in the smallholder agriculture (1.09 +/- 0.11 mg N L-1) and tea plantation (2.13 +/- 0.19 mg N L-1) subcatchments closely followed discharge patterns, indicating mobilization of NO3-N during the rainy seasons. Hysteresis patterns of rainfall events indicate a shift from subsurface flow in the natural forest to surface runoff in agricultural subcatchments. Distinct peaks in NO3-N concentrations were observed during rainfall events after a longer dry period in the forest and tea subcatchments. The high-resolution data set enabled us to identify differences in NO3-N transport of catchments under different land use, such as enhanced NO3-N inputs to the stream during the rainy season and higher annual export in agricultural subcatchments (4.9 +/- 0.3 to 12.0 +/- 0.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in natural forest (2.6 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). This emphasizes the usefulness of our monitoring approach to improve the understanding of land use effects on riverine N exports in tropical landscapes, but also the need to apply such methods in other regions.

Cholera Outbreaks in Africa	CHOLERA OUTBREAKS	Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology											During the current seventh cholera pandemic, Africa bore the major brunt of global disease burden. More than 40 years after its resurgence in Africa in 1970, cholera remains a grave public health problem, characterized by large disease burden, frequent outbreaks, persistent endemicity, and high CFRs, particularly in the region of the central African Great Lakes which might act as reservoirs for cholera. There, cases occur year round with a rise in incidence during the rainy season. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, cholera occurs mostly in outbreaks of varying size with a constant threat of widespread epidemics. Between 1970 and 2011, African countries reported 3,221,050 suspected cholera cases to the World Health Organization, representing 46 % of all cases reported globally. Excluding the Haitian epidemic, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 86 % of reported cases and 99 % of deaths worldwide in 2011. The number of cholera cases is possibly much higher than what is reported to the WHO due to the variation in modalities, completeness, and case definition of national cholera data. One source on country specific incidence rates for Africa, adjusting for underreporting, estimates 1,341,080 cases and 160,930 deaths (52.6 % of 2,548,227 estimated cases and 79.6 % of 209,216 estimated deaths worldwide). Another estimates 1,411,453 cases and 53,632 deaths per year, respectively (50 % of 2,836,669 estimated cases and 58.6 % of 91,490 estimated deaths worldwide). Within Africa, half of all cases between 1970 and 2011 were notified from only seven countries: Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, and South Africa. In contrast to a global trend of decreasing case fatality ratios (CFRs), CFRs have remained stable in Africa at approximately 2 %. Early propagation of cholera outbreaks depends largely on the extent of individual bacterial shedding, host and organism characteristics, the likelihood of people coming into contact with an infectious dose of Vibrio cholerae and on the virulence of the implicated strain. Cholera transmission can then be amplified by several factors including contamination of human water- or food sources; climate and extreme weather events; political and economic crises; high population density combined with poor quality informal housing and poor hygiene practices; spread beyond a local community through human travel and animals, e.g., water birds. At an individual level, cholera risk may increase with decreasing immunity and hypochlorhydria, such as that induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, which is endemic in much of Africa, and may increase individual susceptibility and cholera incidence. Since contaminated water is the main vehicle for the spread of cholera, the obvious longterm solution to eradicate the disease is the provision of safe water to all African populations. This requires considerable human and financial resources and time. In the short and medium term, vaccination may help to prevent and control the spread of cholera outbreaks. Regardless of the intervention, further understanding of cholera biology and epidemiology is essential to identify populations and areas at increased risk and thus ensure the most efficient use of scarce resources for the prevention and control of cholera.

J	Lai, XJ; Jiang, JH; Liang, QH; Huang, Q				Lai, Xijun; Jiang, Jiahu; Liang, Qiuhua; Huang, Qun			Large-scale hydrodynamic modeling of the middle Yangtze River Basin with complex river-lake interactions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The flow regime in the middle Yangtze River Basin is experiencing rapid changes due to intensive human activities and ongoing climate change. The middle reach of Yangtze River and the associated water system are extremely difficult to be reliably modeled due to highly complex interactions between the main stream and many tributaries and lakes. This paper presents a new Coupled Hydrodynamic Analysis Model (CHAM) designed for simulating the large-scale water system in the middle Yangtze River Basin, featured with complex river-lake interactions. CHAM dynamically couples a one-dimensional (1-D) unsteady flow model and a two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic model using a new coupling algorithm that is particularly suitable for large-scale water systems. Numerical simulations are carried out to reproduce the flow regime in the region in 1998 when a severe flood event occurred and in 2006 when it experienced an extremely dry year. The model is able to reproduce satisfactorily the major physical processes featured with seasonal wetting and drying controlled by strong river-lake interactions. This indicates that the present model provides a promising tool for predicting complex flow regimes with remarkable seasonal changes and strong river-lake interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We combined remote sensing images with a water level database from the Hydroweb project to determinethe response of Lake Chad vegetation cover and surface water variations to rainfallfluctuations in the Lake Chad wa-tershed under recent climate conditions. The variance in lake surface water levels was determined by computing themonthly anomaly time series of surface water height and area from the Hydroweb datasets. The spatiotemporal vari-ability of watershed rainfall and vegetation cover of Lake Chad was highlighted through multivariate statistical anal-ysis. The spatial distribution of correlations between watershed rainfall and Lake Chad vegetation cover wasinvestigated. The results show an increase in watershed rainfall, vegetation cover, and surface water area and height,as their slopes were all positive i.e., 5.1 10-4(mm/day); 4.26 10-6(ndvi unit/day); 1.2 10-3(km2/day) and 6 10-5(m/day), respectively. The rainfall variations in the watershed drive those of Lake Chad vegetation cover and surfacewater, as the rainfall trend was strongly and positively correlated with those of vegetation cover (0.79), surface waterheight (0.57), and area (0.53). The time lag between the watershed rainfallfluctuations and lake surface water varia-tions corresponded to approximately similar to 112 days. Between rainfall variations and vegetation cover changes, the spatialdistribution of the time lag showed a response time of<16 days in the western shores of the lake and on both sides ofthe great barrier, about 16 days in the bare soils of the northern basin and the eastern part of the south basin, and>64 days in the marshlands of the southern basin. For the analysis of lakes around the world, this research provides a robust method that computes the spatiotemporal variances of their trends and seasonality and correlates these withthe spatiotemporal variances of climate changes.

In this study spatio-temporal variations in concentrations and risk assessment of selected trace metals (As, Fe, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd and Ni) were investigated during the wet and dry seasons for surface and groundwater in selected human settlements around the lake. The levels of As, Cd and Ni were generally small and were below the detection limit of the instrument. The results showed no significant seasonal variations in the mean levels of Pb, Fe, Zn and Cr in water from the Bosomtwe Crater Lake. The hazard quotients and health hazard indices through ingestion and dermal contact of lake and groundwater in towns around the lake for both adults and children gave values which were below the acceptable limit of less than unity (< 1), indicating the absence of non-carcinogenic health risk to the communities. The study however reveals that ingestion of both lake and groundwater from the lake and its surroundings poses carcinogenic risk with regard to the level of Pb and Cr. Hence appropriate control measures and interventions should be put in place to protect the health of the human population in the study area.																			2193-1801					OCT 18	2016	5								1812	10.1186/s40064-016-3462-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-3462-0								27803847					WOS:000391808300017
C	Peimin, PU		Reddy, MV		Peimin, PU			Dianchi Lake - A hypereutrophic lake in China	Restoration and Management of Tropical Eutrophic Lakes					International Workshop on Restoration and Management of Eutrophic Lakes	2001	Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA					Dianchi Lake has water surface area of 298 km(2), mean depth of 4.4 m and catchment area of 2920 km(2), occupying the sixth largest fresh water lake in China. It is located at the elevation of 1886 meters a.s.l. Getting more intensive sunshine, the highland lake has the higher preliminary production and possesses the characteristics of lakes in the lower latitudes-lakes in the tropical zone. It was rich in aquatic vegetation with more than 100 species, in association with abundant biodiversity in history, The water quality of Dianchi Lake was quite good as the safe drinking water source before the 1970ties. It is a notable recreation site and reputed as "a Sparkling Pearl Imbedded in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau". Starting from the last years of 1970ties, the degradation of water quality became more rapidly. A lot of conventional measures have been taking for controlling eutrophication especially since 1980. But the problem for in proving water quality, to controlling eutrophication and to reconstructing the health aqua-ecosystem, is still far from its solving. All these aspects, such as the background information on the changes of eoc-environmental situation from healthy to degraded hyper-eutrophic state in Dianchi Lake, the reasons of rapid development of eutrophication in Dianchi Lake, the various measures and their results performed for controlling eutrophication were introduced in the first paragraphs of this Chapter. How can we save Dianchi Lake from progressive environmental deterioration? It needs to develop new strategies and technologies based on the laboratory and field experiments. After the event in 1990 (the direct economic lost was about USD 15 million during a week for Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, after an event of algae bloom in Taihu Lake in summer 1990), a serial research and experiment projects directly towards for reconstruction of the helath aqua-ecosystem in local area, especially in the intake area of drinking water source was performed under the support of the Chinese State and Provincial Government, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the International Organizations as well. The small-scale experiments of a couple of thousands or ten thousands square meters were taken place in different environmental conditions. The research results were summarized in the retral paragraphs of this Chapter. The technology for reconstruction of healthy aqua-ecosystem and improvement of water quality in the surface waters from local to all the surface water systems in the catchment step by step mainly using solar energy was named as "Physic-Ecological Engineering-PEEN. it contains 5 key techniques, namely: i) Soft wall and physic-biological membrane technology, ii) Technology for Removing Algae Plume (TRAP) and Improving Transparency, iii) Mosaic technology and Macrobionics, iv) Technology of Immobilized Nitrogen Cycle Bacteria (INCB), and v) Ecological floating island and 5 M-key taches, namely: a) Macrophyte, b) Microorganism, c) Mollusk, d) Macrobionics, and e) Management. The possibility of rapid decrease of pollutants loading into the lake in the next a few years is very low. The approach of dredging sediment is a costly one, but the theoretical analysis and the practices in Dianchi Lake and other lakes showd that it is neither the sufficient nor the necessary one for controlling eutrophication in lakes. Controlling Eutrophication by enhancing purification capacity in lakes might be the most cost-effective approach. The purification capacity in water body should to be enhanced up to form the concentration, which would be lower the thresholds of the nutrients for preventing the algae bloom. To use the sunshine and solar energy to improve the preliminary production in lake by high efficiently transforming the nutrients in water into the biomass and taking off them from the water body as usable and economic beneficial resources by using PEEN technology. Therefore, to develop the Bio-Environmental Enterprise (BEE) is the perspective way out for controlling eutrophication. The theoretical basis and technical approaches for controlling eutrophication by enhancing purification capacity in lakes and the technology for utilizing the aquatic plant and other resources were dealt in this Chapter. The perspective for controlling eutrophication in the surface waters appears with optimism. Of course, there are a lot of issues in this field still need to be studied and solved in the further.																					1-57808-370-2				2005							423	518																WOS:000235752400016

Evaluation of the biodegradability of fluorescent dissolved organic matter via biological filtration	AWWA WATER SCIENCE												Fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) via biofiltration under varying operational and water quality conditions was investigated in this study. Three feedwaters (lake, river, and wastewater effluent) were examined at three temperatures (6, 22, and 28 degrees C) and three empty bed contact times (EBCTs; 5, 15, and 30 min) to simulate seasonal and operational variations experienced by utilities. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis was used to characterize the fluorescing DOM and to determine the component removal. Three components were found in the lake and river feedwaters, and four components were found in the wastewater effluent. In natural source waters, protein-like components were removed most effectively via biofiltration. In the wastewater effluent, a humic-like component common in nutrient-rich waters was removed most effectively, and the protein-like component was removed second most effectively. Increased EBCT and temperature increased the removal efficiency of bulk DOM and the protein-like components.

The Lake Victoria basin (LVB) has experienced extensive forest and grass degradation and agricultural land expansion under rapid socio-economic development and population growth in recent decades. However, the hydrological impacts of LULC changes for the whole LVB is still poorly documented. This study first investigated the LULC changing effects of LVB, focusing on its impacts on the annual and seasonal runoff and the hydrological drought based on a distributed hydrological modeling of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT model showed comparatively good applicability in seasonal runoff simulation of LVB, with the percent bias (PBIAS) kept within +/- 20 % and the coefficient of determination (R2) over 0.6 at ten hydrological stations available over the calibration and validation phases. Generally, the annual runoff obtained a monthly increase of 1.5 mm under collective LULC changes. Moreover, the LULC effects presented considerable seasonal dependence. A largest runoff increase of approximately 4 mm was detected in short rainy season attributed to the combined surface runoff and groundwater increase. Insignificant runoff increase was observed in long rainy and dry seasons under the complementary effects of surface runoff increase and groundwater decrease. Additionally, the hydrological drought was generally aggravated with increased drought frequency and lengthened duration, particularly for the central western and eastern regions with massive conversion of forest to agricultural land. The findings provide importance implication for rational water resources management and drought disaster response for the LVB.

The study focuses on detecting subtle changes in land cover classes, thermokarst water bodies, river dynamics, retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) and infrastructure in the Yamal Peninsula, Urengoy and Pechora regions. Very high-resolution optical imagery (sub-meter) derived from WorldView, QuickBird and GeoEye in conjunction with declassified Corona images were involved in the analyses. The comparison of very high-resolution images acquired in 2003/2004 and 2016/2017 indicates a pronounced increase in the extent of tundra and a slight increase of land covered by water. The number of water bodies increased in all three regions, especially in discontinuous permafrost, where 14.86% of new lakes and ponds were initiated between 2003 and 2017. The analysis of the evolution of two river channels in Yamal and Urengoy indicates the dominance of erosion during the last two decades. An increase of both rivers' lengths and a significant widening of the river channels were also observed. The number and total surface of RTS in the Yamal Peninsula strongly increased between 2004 and 2016. A mean annual headwall retreat rate of 1.86 m/year was calculated. Extensive networks of infrastructure occurred in the Yamal Peninsula in the last two decades, stimulating the initiation of new thermokarst features. The significant warming and seasonal variations of the hydrologic cycle, in particular, increased snow water equivalent acted in favor of deepening of the active layer; thus, an increasing number of thermokarst lake formations.

Understanding the hydrological system dynamics of a glaciated alpine catchment in the Himalayan region using the J2000 hydrological model	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This paper provides the results of hydrological modelling in a mesoscale glaciated alpine catchment of the Himalayan region. In the context of global climate change, the hydrological regime of an alpine mountain is likely to be affected, which might produce serious implications for downstream water availability. The main objective of this study was to understand the hydrological system dynamics of a glaciated catchment, the Dudh Kosi River basin, in Nepal, using the J2000 hydrological model and thereby understand how the rise in air temperature will affect the hydrological processes. The model is able to reproduce the overall hydrological dynamics quite well with an efficiency result of Nash-Sutcliffe (0.85), logarithm Nash-Sutcliffe (0.93) and coefficient of determination (0.85) for the study period. The average contribution from glacier areas to total streamflow is estimated to be 17%, and snowmelt (other than from glacier areas) accounts for another 17%. This indicates the significance of the snow and glacier runoff in the Himalayan region. The hypothetical rise in temperature scenarios at a rate of +2 and +4 degrees C indicated that the snowmelt process might be largely affected. An increase in snowmelt volume is noted during the premonsoon period, whereas the contribution during the monsoon season is significantly decreased. This occurs mainly because the rise in temperature will shift the snowline up to areas of higher altitude and thereby reduce the snow storage capacity of the basin. This indicates that the region is particularly vulnerable to global climate change and the associated risk of decreasing water availability to downstream areas. Under the assumed warming scenarios, it is likely that in the future, the river might shift from a melt-dominated river' to a rain-dominated river'. The J2000 model should be considered a promising tool to better understand the hydrological dynamics in alpine mountain catchments of the Himalayan region. This understanding will be quite useful for further analysis of what-if scenarios' in the context of global climate and land-use changes and ultimately for sustainable Integrated Water Resources Management in the Himalayan region.

J	Dimova, NT; Burnett, WC; Chanton, JP; Corbett, JE				Dimova, Natasha T.; Burnett, William C.; Chanton, Jeffrey P.; Corbett, Jane Elizabeth			Application of radon-222 to investigate groundwater discharge into small shallow lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The objective of this work was to assess the groundwater discharge component of the hydrological budgets of several small lakes in north and central Florida using Rn-222 (radon, r(1/2) = 3.8 days) as a quantitative groundwater tracer. Methane gas and conductivity were also used as secondary natural tracers to help locate active sites of seepage. We present results based on a steady-state radon mass balance model developed to assess groundwater discharge into shallow unstratified lakes. Model assumptions include a constant Rn-222 input flux over relatively short (days-weeks) periods and a well-mixed water column. Detailed surveys in several Florida lakes using continuous Rn-222 measurements supported these assumptions. In five of the seven studied lakes a high to moderate groundwater inflow was detected using this technique, while in two of them the discharge was very low to not detectable. Based on these results and the size of the lakes the calculated water-renewal times based on groundwater inflows were in a range between 3 and 40 months. Close 2-year examination of the groundwater dynamics at two of the lakes that showed substantial discharge, did not show great seasonal groundwater discharge variations. These radon-derived groundwater seepage fluxes agreed well with seepage meters and water budget calculations performed independently for some of the lakes. The approach proved to be very efficient, relatively inexpensive, and should be able to be applied as a routine procedure for estimating groundwater discharge for similar lakes elsewhere. The ultimate purpose of our efforts is to use this method in obtaining important information for the hydrological budget of these lakes that will allow evaluating nutrient loadings and TMDLs (Total Maximum Daily Loads) calculations.

But, the anthropogenic forces affecting lake water quality (climate change, land use change, and invasive species) are unevenly distributed across lakes, across the seasonal cycle, and across space within lakes, potentially leading to highly variable water quality responses that are poorly documented at the global scale. Here, we used 742 million chlorophyll-a (chl-a) estimates merged over 6 satellite sensors (daily, 1 to 4 km resolution) to quantify water quality changes from 1997 to 2020 in 344 globally-distributed large lakes. Chl-a decreased across 56% of the cumulative total lake area, challenging the putative widespread increase in chl-a that is expected due to human activity. 19% of lakes exhibited both positive and negative chl-a trends (p-value <0.1) across different locations or times of the year. This spatiotemporal complexity demonstrates the value of moderate resolution mapping of lake chl-a to inform water management decision-making and to determine the local ecological consequences of human activity.

Hydrological controls on surface vegetation dynamics over West and Central Africa	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												A considerable number of independent case studies have shown the explicit role of rainfall and soil moisture as drivers of surface vegetation dynamics. However, the weak relationship exhibited by rainfall and soil moisture with vegetation productivity in some semi-arid and humid ecosystems of Africa due to a complex combination of social and environmental factors warrants further assessment of hydrological controls on surface vegetation changes. In this study, hydrological control on surface vegetation in West and Central Africa (WCA) using monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (2002-2013) as a vegetation proxy, is explored by using terrestrial water storage (TWS) inverted from time-variable satellite gravity observations. Statistical relationships indicated that the temporal patterns of NDVI with TWS over West Africa, and in catchment-specific cases, were generally slightly stronger than the widely reported association between rainfall and NDVI. The strongest temporal association between TWS and NDVI was found in Lake Chad basin (R-2 = 69% at alpha = 0.05) and southern Mali (R-2 = 62% at alpha = 0.05). However, when the spatial relations of TWS-NDVI and rainfall-NDVI were evaluated (monthly and seasonal scales), rainfall showed a considerable and wider spread of significant association (alpha = 0.05) with surface vegetation greenness compared to TWS. But some locations in the semi-arid Sahel exist where spatial relationships between NDVI and TWS were relatively higher and consistent as opposed to the rainfall-NDVI relationship. A contemporary understanding of the water driven variability in surface vegetation in WCA indicates that (i) the preponderance of observed positive correlations of NDVI with TWS and rainfall are predominantly found in the Sudano-Sahelian ecosystems, where total NDVI variability is apparently the highest (51.4%) and (ii) some of the Sahelian vegetation also show considerable and significant association with model-derived groundwater. As a strong hydrological indicator in rain-fed semi-arid catchments of West Africa, TWS can be employed as a resourceful tool to provide early warning systems and improve the monitoring of climate impacts on groundwater dependent vegetation communities.

Supraglacial lakes can act as a control on ice dynamics since, given a large enough volume of water and a favourable stress regime, hydrofracture of the lake can occur, which enables water transfer from the ice surface to the bedrock, where it can lubricate the base. The depth (and thus volume) of these lakes is typically estimated by applying a radiative transfer equation (RTE) to optical satellite imagery. This method can be used at scale across entire ice sheets but is poorly validated due to a paucity of in situ depth data. Here we intercompare supraglacial lake depth detection by means of ArcticDEM digital elevation models, ICESat-2 photon refraction, and the RTE applied to Sentinel-2 images across five lakes in southwest Greenland. We found good agreement between the ArcticDEM and ICESat-2 approaches (Pearson's r=0.98) but found that the RTE overestimates lake depth by up to 153 % using the green band (543-578 nm) and underestimates lake depth by up to 63 % using the red band (650-680 nm). Parametric uncertainty in the RTE estimates is substantial and is dominated by uncertainty in estimates of reflectance at the lakebed, which are derived empirically. Uncertainty in lake depth estimates translates into a poor understanding of total lake volume, which could mean that hydrofracture likelihood is poorly constrained, in turn affecting ice velocity predictions. Further laboratory studies to constrain spectral radiance loss in the water column and investigation of the potential effects of cryoconite on lakebed reflectance could improve the RTE in its current format. However, we also suggest that future work should explore multi-sensor approaches to deriving lake depth from optical satellite imagery, which may improve depth estimates and will certainly result in better-constrained uncertainties.

However, the direct relationships between climate variability and water quality are complicated by a multitude of hydrological and biochemical mechanisms dominate the process. Thus, little is known regarding how water quality responds to climate variability in the context of changing meteorological conditions and human activities. Here, a longitudinal study was conducted using trend, correlation, and redundancy analyses to explore stream water quality sensitivity to temperature, precipitation, streamflow, and how the sensitivity was affected by watershed climate, land cover percentage, landscape configuration, fertilizer application, and tillage types. Specifically, daily pollutant concentration data of suspended solid (SS), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate and nitrite (NOx), and chloride (Cl) were used as water quality indicators in four Lake Erie watersheds from 1985 to 2017, during which the average tem-perature has increased 0.5 degrees C and the total precipitation has increased 9%. Results show that precipitation and flow were positively associated with SRP, NOx, TKN, TP, and SS, except for SRP and NOx in the urban basin. The rising temperatures led to increasing concentrations of SS, TKN, and TP in the urban basin. SRP and NOx sensitivity to precipitation was higher in the years with more precipitation and higher precipitation seasonality, and the basins with more spatially aggregated cropland. No-tillage and reduced tillage management could decrease both precipitation and temperature sensitivity for most pollutants. As one of the first studies leveraging multiple watershed environmental variables with long-term historical climate and water quality data, this study can assist target land use planning and management policy to mitigate future climate change effects on surface water quality.					; Burton, Glenn/Q-9714-2016; Zhao, Gang/H-9030-2019	Wang, Runzi/0000-0001-8273-6801; Zhao, Gang/0000-0003-2737-0530; Shehab, Isabella/0000-0002-6272-3197; Burton, Glenn/0000-0002-8660-6294; Ma, Yueying/0000-0002-9699-8180; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 1	2023	325		A						116449	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116449		OCT 2022						36252329					WOS:000877553600004

Human health hazard may arise from drinking contaminated water. Additionally, cyanobacterial blooms affect other economic areas such as tourism, recreation, commercial fishery, water management and monitoring. Nowadays there is a scarcity of information on seasonal variations of cyanotoxins in various regions. Understanding of historical trends and seasonal variation patters is a foundation for forecasting and will help to develop effective water management strategies. This review gives an overview of cyanotoxins' analysis and levels in freshwater environments with particular emphasis on seasonal variations in Europe.

J	Little, MA				Little, Michael A.			Evolutionary Strategies for Body Size	FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY												Humans show marked variation in body size around the world, both within and among populations. At present, the tallest people in the world are from the Netherlands and the Balkan countries, while the shortest populations are central African Pygmies. There are genetic, genetic plasticity, developmental, and environmental bases for size variation in Homo sapiens from the recent past and the present. Early populations of Homo species also have shown considerable size variation. Populations from the present and the past are also marked by sexual dimorphism, which, itself, shows group variation. There is abundant evidence for the effects of limited food and disease on human growth and resultant adult body size. This environmental influence has been reflected in "secular trends" (over a span of years) in growth and adult size from socioeconomic prosperity or poverty (availability of resources). Selective and evolutionary advantages of small or large body size also have been documented. Heritability for human height is relatively great with current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identifying hundreds of genes leading to causes of growth and adult size variation. There are also endocrinological pathways limiting growth. An example is the reduced tissue sensitivity to human growth hormone (HGH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in Philippine and African hunter-gatherer populations. In several short-statured hunter-gatherer populations (Asian, African, and South American), it has been hypothesized that short life expectancy has selected for early maturity and truncated growth to enhance fertility. Some island populations of humans and other mammals are thought to have been selected for small size because of limited resources, especially protein. The high-protein content of milk as a staple food may contribute to tall stature in East African pastoral peoples. These and other evolutionary questions linked to life history, male competition, reproduction, and mobility are explored in this paper.																			1664-2392					MAR 10	2020	11								107	10.3389/fendo.2020.00107	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00107								32210916					WOS:000525264900001

The purpose of this study is to review what has been documented, thus it gives an overview of what is known and seeks to explain the implications of a changing climate, hence what ought to be known to create a climate resilient environment. Design/methodology/approach Terms such as climate, climate change and climate variability were identified in recent peer-reviewed published literature to find recent climate-related literature on Uganda. Findings from independent researchers and consultants are incorporated. Data obtained from rainfall and temperature observations and from COSMO-CLM Regional Climate Model-Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CCLM CORDEX) data, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) have been used to generate spatial maps, seasonal outputs and projections using GrADS 2.02 and Geographic Information System (GIS) software for visualization. Findings The climate of Uganda is tropical in nature and influenced by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), varied relief, geo-location and inland lakes, among other factors. The impacts of severe weather and climate trends and variability have been documented substantially in the past 20-30 years. Most studies indicated a rainfall decline. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures are on the rise, while projections indicate a decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature both in the near and far future. The implication of these changes on society and the economy are discussed herein. Cost of inaction is expected to become huge, given factors like, the growing rate of the population and the slow expanding economy experienced in Uganda. Varied forms of adaptation to the impacts of climate change are being implemented, especially in the agricultural sector and at house hold level, though not systematically. Originality/value This review of scientific research findings aims to create a better understanding of the recent climate change and variability in Uganda and provides a baseline of summarized information for use in future research and actions.																			1756-8692	1756-8706					2018	10	5					752	771		10.1108/IJCCSM-04-2017-0090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJCCSM-04-2017-0090													WOS:000442230700006

Wetlands have the functions of ecological water storage, water supply, and climate regulation, which plays an indispensable role in global environmental security. The Pumqu River Basin (PRB) is located in an area with extremely vulnerable ecological environment, where climate change is obvious. Understanding wetland distribution, changes and causes in the PRB are of great importance to the rational management and protection of wetlands. Using the Landsat series satellite images, wetlands of this area in 2000, 2010, and 2018 were extracted. The results showed that (1) there were obvious regional differences in wetland types and their distribution patterns in the basin. Wetlands were mainly distributed in areas with slopes less than 12 degrees and at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m. (2) During the past 20 years, the wetland area in the basin decreased, and the changing trend of wetlands was different. Palustrine wetlands decreased tremendously, riverine and lacustrine wetlands first decreased and then increased, while floodplain wetlands first increased and then decreased. Palustrine wetlands were reclaimed to cultivated land, but the proportion of reclamation is small. (3) Climate dominated wetland changes in the PRB. The changes in riverine and lacustrine wetlands were mainly affected by the warm-season average temperature, the change in palustrine wetlands was mainly related to the annual precipitation and the warm-season average temperature, and the change in floodplain wetlands was related to the warm-season precipitation. To achieve sustainable development, the government plays a guiding role and actively formulates and implements wetland protection policies, such as restricting or prohibiting grazing on wetlands, which play an important role in wetland protection and restoration.

A global hotspot for dissolved organic carbon in hypermaritime watersheds of coastal British Columbia	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The perhumid region of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) of Pacific North America is one of the wettest places on Earth and contains numerous small catchments that discharge freshwater and high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) directly to the coastal ocean. However, empirical data on the flux and composition of DOC exported from these watersheds are scarce. We established monitoring stations at the outlets of seven catchments on Calvert and Hecate islands, British Columbia, which represent the rain-dominated hypermaritime region of the perhumid CTR. Over several years, we measured stream discharge, stream water DOC concentration, and stream water dissolved organic-matter (DOM) composition. Discharge and DOC concentrations were used to calculate DOC fluxes and yields, and DOM composition was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The areal estimate of annual DOC yield in water year 2015 was 33.3 Mg C km(-2) yr(-1), with individual watersheds ranging from an average of 24.1 to 37.7 Mg C km(-2) yr(-1). This represents some of the highest DOC yields to be measured at the coastal margin. We observed seasonality in the quantity and composition of exports, with the majority of DOC export occurring during the extended wet period (September-April). Stream flow from catchments reacted quickly to rain inputs, resulting in rapid export of relatively fresh, highly terrestrial-like DOM. DOC concentration and measures of DOM composition were related to stream discharge and stream temperature and correlated with watershed attributes, including the extent of lakes and wetlands, and the thickness of organic and mineral soil horizons. Our discovery of high DOC yields from these small catchments in the CTR is especially compelling as they deliver relatively fresh, highly terrestrial organic matter directly to the coastal ocean. Hypermaritime landscapes are common on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that this coastal margin may play an important role in the regional processing of carbon and in linking terrestrial carbon to marine ecosystems.

J	Lininger, KB; Latrubesse, EM				Lininger, Katherine B.; Latrubesse, Edgardo M.			Flooding hydrology and peak discharge attenuation along the middle Araguaia River in central Brazil	CATENA												The Araguaia River in central Brazil is the largest river draining the Brazilian savanna. Located in a tropical wet dry climate, the middle Araguaia River has an extensive and complex alluvial floodplain composed of a mosaic of geomorphologic units, dense alluvial forest, and many floodplain lakes. The Araguaia River is not currently dammed, and thus it provides an opportunity to analyze flooding hydrology in a relatively un-altered tropical system. Using average daily discharge measurements from 1975 to 2011, we analyze patterns of peak discharge attenuation (defined as the reduction in absolute peak discharge in m(3) s(-1)). We link peak discharge attenuation to bankfull discharge, explore whether peak discharge attenuation results in increased base level flows in the dry season following peak discharge, and use a simplified short-term water budget to determine whether peak discharge attenuation results in the loss of discharge from the channel over the flooding season (November to May). In addition, we explore other potential factors causing peak discharge attenuation, including surface water connectivity between the channel and floodplain lakes and floodplain lake area change between the dry season and the wet season. Although fluvial connectivity between the main channel and the floodplains starts before bankfull stage, we find that large peak discharge attenuation (up to 30% reduction in peak discharge) in the middle Araguaia usually occurs when the river rises above bankfull discharge. The river flow that is lost to the flood plain and floodplain lakes when peak discharge attenuation occurs usually returns to the channel by the end of the flooding season. However, the odds of increased baseflows in the dry season after flooding seasons with peak discharge attenuation are higher compared to flooding seasons without peak discharge attenuation for one of the studied reaches. Some types of floodplain lakes greatly increase in area from the dry season to the wet season, and many floodplain lakes become connected via surface water in the wet season. We have not found similar examples of peak attenuation in this type of tropical wet-dry floodplain system, indicating that the middle Araguaia River may be a unique system or that further research is needed.

The interannual ln(chl. a) exhibited positive correlations with the mean air temperature, mean minimum air temperature, and mean maximum air temperature; in addition, a positive relationship between Delta ln(chl. a) and Delta TP was observed throughout the period. Additionally, ln(chl. a) exhibited a positive correlation with the TP concentration, negative correlations with the sunshine hours and wind speed during the dry season, and positive correlations with the TN and TP concentrations during the rainy season. Furthermore, TP was the most influential factor affecting cyanobacterial bloom dynamics throughout the entire period and during the dry season, and TN and TP were the most important factors during the rainy season, as determined by relative importance analysis. The results of this study based on interannual analysis demonstrated that both meteorological factors and nutrient levels have important roles in controlling cyanobacterial bloom dynamics. The relative importance of these factors may change according to precipitation patterns. Thus, climate change regulation and cutrophication management should be considered in strategies for bloom control. Decreasing the TP load should be prioritized throughout the entire period and during the dry season, and decreasing the TN and TP loads should be considered initially during the rainy season. In addition, further studies of more frequent and complete data acquired over a longer period of time should be conducted in the future.

This work studies the MP pollution in one of the other-wise underrepresented in literature Mediterranean coastal lagoons, over the course of a year. Our findings report an average of 40-50 particles/L per month in the lagoon with a significant MP correlation to environmental pa-rameters (salinity, temperature, pH and wind). The microplastic particles were primarily fibers of nylon and polystyrene, as identified through Raman microscopy. The MP distribution in the lagoon was shown to be affected by the antagonistic effect of fresh and sea water. Finally, by reviewing previous studies, we provide evidence that mesh size and MP abundance are exponentially correlated and discuss the need for a global protocol in MP studies.

An integrated ecological engineering was applied to treat the eutrophic water of the Shuangqiao River (SQ River), one of the most heavily polluted rivers inflowing to the Chaohu Lake, China. A multi-pond constructed wetlands system was built up to treat the external loading of wastewater. Meanwhile, an in situ purification system consisted of sediment dredging, hydrophytes restoration and artificial floating islands was constructed to purify the internal loading and the river course water. By monitoring the river water quality and analyzing the samples of sediments and plants, the treatment effects and efficiencies of single and integrated ecological technique were studied. Our results indicated that the implement of ecological project notably enhanced the river's capacity of reducing total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and potassium permanganate index (COD), which had increased from 2.49, 33.69 and 40.32 tons per year to 3.75, 58.28 and 74.36 tons per year, respectively. As a result, the concentrations of TP, TN and COD in the river water were dropped by 10.5%, 11.8% and 8.2% respectively. The monitoring data also showed that the removal efficiency of the in situ purification system varied with the seasons, while that of the wetlands system remained at a high level throughout the year, indicating the feasibility of a combination of different techniques to reduce the impact of season on water purification. In summary, this research indicated that single ecological technique produced no satisfying results due to the limits of technique features and environmental conditions, while the integrated engineering techniques could overcome those restrictions and had the potential to remediate heavily polluted rivers.

Thus, solid and spatially dense geological information is needed to model the response of karst hydrological systems to such changes. Additionally, environmental information archived in lake sediments can be used to understand past climate effects on karst water systems. In the present study, we carry out a multi-methodological geophysical survey to investigate the geological situation and sedimentary infill of two karst lakes (Metzabok and Tzibana) of the Lacandon Forest in Chiapas, southern Mexico. Both lakes present large seasonal lake-level fluctuations and experienced an unusually sudden and strong lake-level decline in the first half of 2019, leaving Lake Metzabok (maximum depth similar to 25 m) completely dry and Lake Tziband (depth similar to 70 m) with a water level decreased by approx. 15 m. Before this event, during a lake-level high stand in March 2018, we collected water-borne seismic data with a sub-bottom profiler (SBP) and transient electromagnetic (TEM) data with a newly developed floating single-loop configuration. In October 2019, after the sudden drainage event, we took advantage of this unique situation and carried out complementary measurements directly on the exposed lake floor of Lakes Metzabok and Tziband. During this second campaign, we collected time-domain induced polarization (TDIP) and seismic refraction tomography (SRT) data. By integrating the multi-methodological data set, we (1) identify 5-6 m thick, likely undisturbed sediment sequences on the bottom of both lakes, which are suitable for future paleoenvironmental drilling campaigns, (2) develop a comprehensive geological model implying a strong interconnectivity between surface water and karst aquifer, and (3) evaluate the potential of the applied geophysical approach for the reconnaissance of the geological situation of karst lakes. This methodological evaluation reveals that under the given circumstances, (i) SBP and TDIP phase images consistently resolve the thickness of the fine-grained lacustrine sediments covering the lake floor, (ii) TEM and TDIP resistivity images consistently detect the upper limit of the limestone bedrock and the geometry of fluvial deposits of a river delta, and (iii) TDIP and SRT images suggest the existence of a layer that separates the lacustrine sediments from the limestone bedrock and consists of collapse debris mixed with lacustrine sediments. Our results show that the combination of seismic methods, which are most widely used for lake-bottom reconnaissance, with resistivity-based methods such as TEM and TDIP can significantly improve the interpretation by resolving geological units or bedrock heterogeneities, which are not visible from seismic data. Only the use of complementary methods provides sufficient information to develop comprehensive geological models of such complex karst environments					; España, José Alberto/KBQ-4754-2024; Orozco, Adrian/V-9870-2019; Perez, Liseth/HZI-0811-2023	Buckel, Johannes/0000-0001-8973-1122; Perez, Liseth/0000-0002-5256-3070; MORALES BARRERA, WENDY VANESA/0000-0001-8254-5116; Steiner, Matthias/0000-0002-3595-3616; Gallistl, Jakob/0000-0002-2037-7775; Flores Orozco, Adrian/0000-0003-0905-3718; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; 													1869-9510	1869-9529				FEB 24	2021	12	2					439	461		10.5194/se-12-439-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/se-12-439-2021													WOS:000625304600001
J	Fraser, A; Dastoor, A; Ryjkov, A				Fraser, Annemarie; Dastoor, Ashu; Ryjkov, Andrei			How important is biomass burning in Canada to mercury contamination?	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Wildfire frequency has increased in past four decades in Canada and is expected to increase in future as a result of climate change (Wotton et al., 2010). Mercury (Hg) emissions from biomass burning are known to be significant; however, the impact of biomass burning on air concentration and deposition fluxes in Canada has not been previously quantified. We use estimates of burned biomass from FINN (Fire INventory from NCAR) and vegetation-specific emission factors (EFs) of mercury to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of Hg emissions in Canada. We use Environment and Climate Change Canada's GEM-MACH-Hg (Global Environmental Multi-scale, Modelling Air quality and Chemistry model, mercury version) to quantify the impact of biomass burning in Canada on spatiotemporal variability of air concentrations and deposition fluxes of mercury in Canada. We use North American gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) observations (2010-2015), GEM-MACH-Hg, and an inversion technique to optimize the EFs for GEM for five vegetation types represented in North American fires to constrain the biomass burning impacts of mercury. The inversion results suggest that EFs representing more vegetation types - specifically peatland - are required. This is currently limited by the sparseness of measurements of Hg from biomass burning plumes. More measurements of Hg concentration in the air, specifically downwind of fires, would improve the inversions. We use three biomass burning Hg emissions scenarios in Canada to conduct three sets of model simulations for 2010-2015: two scenarios where Hg is emitted only as GEM using literature or optimized EFs and a third scenario where Hg is emitted as GEM using literature EFs and particle bound mercury (PBM) emitted using the average GEM/PBM ratio from lab measurements. The three biomass burning emission scenarios represent a range of possible values for the impacts of Hg emissions from biomass burning in Canada on Hg concentration and deposition. We find total biomass burning Hg emissions to be highly variable from year to year and estimate average 2010-2015 total atmospheric biomass burning emissions of Hg in Canada to be between 6 and 14 t during the biomass burning season (i.e. from May to September), which is 37 times the mercury emission from anthropogenic sources in Canada for this period. On average, 65% of the emissions occur in the provinces west of Ontario. We find that while emissions from biomass burning have a small impact on surface air concentrations of GEM averaged over individual provinces/territories, the impact at individual sites can be as high as 95% during burning events. We estimate average annual mercury deposition from biomass burning in Canada to be between 0.3 and 2.8 t, compared to 0.14 t of mercury deposition from anthropogenic sources during the biomass burning season in Canada. Compared to the biomass burning emissions, the relative impact of fires on mercury deposition is shifted eastward, with on average 54% percent of the deposition occurring in provinces west of Ontario. While the relative contribution of Canadian biomass burning to the total mercury deposition over each province/territory is no more than 9% between 2010 and 2015, the local contribution in some locations (including areas downwind of biomass burning) can be as high as 80% (e.g. northwest of Great Slave Lake in 2014) from May to September. We find that northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, central British Columbia, and the area around Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories are at greater risk of mercury contamination from biomass burning. GEM is considered to be the dominant mercury species emitted from biomass burning; however, there remains an uncertainty in the speciation of mercury released from biomass burning. We find that the impact of biomass burning emissions on mercury deposition is significantly affected by the uncertainty in speciation of emitted mercury because PBM is more readily deposited closer to the emission sources than GEM; an addition of similar to 18% percent of mercury emission from biomass burning in the form of PBM in the model increases the 6-year average deposition by similar to 4 times.

J	Mirzavand, M; Ghazban, F				Mirzavand, Mohammad; Ghazban, Fereydoun			Isotopic and hydrochemical evidence for the source and mechanism of groundwater salinization in Kashan Plain aquifer in Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Groundwater salinization and interaction between Playa Lake and regional groundwater were investigated using multi-chemo-isotopic evidences. Forty groundwater and 26 Kashan Playa Lake (KPL) water samples were collected and analyzed for their geochemical compositions. The evolution of hydrochemical facies in Kashan Plain Aquifer (KPA) to KPL is Ca-HCO3 (19%), Mix Ca-Cl (9%), Ca-Cl (17%), and Mix Na-Cl and Na-Cl (55%). Also, the Hydrochemical Facies Evolution Diagram (HFE-D) proposed cation exchange as the main process of salinization in KPA. Based on the binary hydrogeochemical diagrams of (Na+/Cl-)/Cl-, (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/HCO3- + SO4(2-), and Cl/Br, dissolution of halite and gypsum in the Miocene marlstone in the KPA is the main source of salinity. The delta O-18 of water in aquifer and playa water samples varies from -10.03 to 7.03 parts per thousand (VSMOW) with an average of -6.95 parts per thousand and -60.73 to 25.08 parts per thousand with average of -45.82 parts per thousand for delta H-2. Based on the results, the relation between delta O-18 and delta H-2, and delta O-18 and Br, approves discharge of saline water from KPA to KPL. Likewise, the isotopic composition of delta(SO4)-S-34, varies from 5.95 to 22.55 parts per thousand CDT in KPA, and 5.95 to 9.99 parts per thousand CDT in KPL. Also, the relations between delta O-18-delta S-34(SO4) and Cl-delta S-34 were non-linear, indicating that sulfur concentration in KPA and KPL changed due to sulfide oxidation and sulfate reduction in the freshwater and deep brines in the aquifer and mixed during the over-pumping in the KPA. Oxidation of sulfide minerals in the mineralized region in the western part of the aquifer (recharge zone) may have been the source of sulfur leached by seasonal runoff. Water-rock interaction, ion exchange, and hydraulic gradient have been the dominating factors in changing the water chemistry between aquifer and playa leading to saline groundwater discharged to the playa.

The complex nature for studying water quality requires finding simple models to identify the variables that influence it the most. Therefore, the use of multivariate analysis techniques will be of immense help to find relationships and conclusions which aid us to determine the state of water quality through biological, physical and chemical indicators. In this investigation, the following variables were evaluated: Temperature, pH, transparency, turbidity, nitrates, orthophosphates, phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, solar radiation, dissolved oxygen and microcystins. These determined water quality at the sample sites, Gamboa and Paraiso. The results obtained through the application of a two-way multivariate analysis method called HJ-Biplot reflect variables relationships of chemical, physical and biological compositions. Furthermore, results conform two clusters of sample points that satisfactorily match to the region seasons. Cluster 1 is characterized by the presence of the following variables: pH, transparency, chlorophyll a, oxygen and temperature. On the other hand, cluster 2 comprises the following variables: nitrate, orthophosphates, turbidity and P-total. They are all parameters that suffer variations in the rainy season, and that, in turn, can influence the presence of ciabobacteria with toxigenic potential. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the multivariate statistical methods are valuable for interpreting complex data sets, specifically, for water quality monitoring network.

Seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes on a floating ice tongue, Petermann Glacier, Greenland	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Supraglacial lakes are known to trigger Antarctic ice-shelf instability and break-up. However, to date, no study has focused on lakes on Greenland's floating termini. Here, we apply lake boundary/area and depth algorithms to Landsat 8 imagery to analyse the inter- and intraseasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes across Petermann Glacier's (81 degrees N) floating tongue from 2014 to 2016, while also comparing these lakes to those on the grounded ice. Lakes start to fill in June and quickly peak in total number, volume and area in late June/early July in response to increases in air temperatures. However, through July and August, total lake number, volume and area all decline, despite sustained high temperatures. These observations may be explained by the transportation of meltwater into the ocean by a river, and by lake drainage events on the floating tongue. Further, as mean lake depth remains relatively constant during this time, we suggest that a large proportion of the lakes that drain, do so completely, likely by rapid hydrofracture. The mean areas of lakes on the tongue are only similar to 20% of those on the grounded ice and exhibit lower variability in maximum and mean depth, differences likely attributable to the contrasting formation processes of lakes in each environment.

Continuous In Situ Nutrient Analyzers Pinpoint the Onset and Rate of Internal P Loading under Anoxia in Lake Erie's Central Basin	ACS ES&T WATER												Lake Erie's central basin experiences seasonal anoxia, contributing to internal sediment phosphorus (P) loading and exacerbating eutrophication. The precise conditions required for internal loading are poorly understood. This study constrains the timing and rates of internal P loading using continuous in situ temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and soluble reactive P (SRP) observations from two sites. SRP concentrations remained low during normoxia (>2 mg of DO L-1) and hypoxia (0-2 mg of DO L-1) but increased abruptly after anoxia for 12-42 h. SRP flux rate estimations varied, likely due to advection and hypolimnion thickness variation, but could still be reasonably quantified. Flux rates and standard errors during anoxia averaged 25.67 +/- 5.5 mg m(-2) day(-1) at the shallower site and 11.42 +/- 2.6 mg m(-2) day(-1) at the deeper site. At the shallower site, the anoxic hypolimnion was displaced with normoxic water, causing cessation of P flux until anoxia returned, and higher flux rates resumed immediately (89.1 +/- 8.6 mg m(-2) day(-1)), suggesting rapid, redox-controlled P desorption from surface sediments. On the basis of our rate and onset findings, the expected anoxic area and duration in the basin could yield an annual internal SRP load comparable to the annual central basin TP tributary load of 10000-11000 metric tonnes.					; Godwin, Casey/JVZ-2099-2024; Godwin, Casey/E-6892-2014; Mason, Lacey/X-3045-2018	Anderson, Hanna/0000-0002-1497-3650; Godwin, Casey/0000-0002-4454-7521; Mason, Lacey/0000-0003-1541-3134														2690-0637				APR 9	2021	1	4					774	781		10.1021/acsestwater.0c00138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.0c00138		FEB 2021											WOS:000654124800004

Yet, knowledge of land-air Hg dynamics in alpine grasslands remains poor. Hg fluxes over an alpine meadow were measured throughout a full vegetation period in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP). This TP grassland served as a small source of atmospheric total gaseous Hg (TGM) during vegetation period (0.92 mu g m(-2)) fluxes decreased logarithmically during plant growing season, resulting from the influence of vegetation by light shading and plant Hg uptake, although the latter might be minor due to low biomass at this site. Temporal patterns of TGM indicated the importance of land-air dynamics in regulating TGM levels. During the plant emergence, diel pattern of TGM covaried with Hg emission fluxes resulting in lower concentrations at night and higher concentrations in afternoon. During all other vegetation stages, TGM showed minima before dawn and "morning peak" shortly after sunrise, in conjunction with corresponding Hg fluxes showing sink before dawn and source after sunrise. Moreover, TGM concentrations showed a decreasing trend with plant growing, further indicating the role of vegetation in driving seasonal TGM variations by regulating land-air Hg dynamics.					; junming, guo/JZC-7672-2024; Ma, Ming/AAB-7195-2019; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; Guo, Junming/JZC-7672-2024; Huang, Jie/GWQ-5005-2022	huang, jie/0000-0002-3060-0862; Ma, Ming/0000-0001-6915-0953; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; Guo, Junming/0000-0002-3133-5597; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 19	2020	54	10					6043	6052		10.1021/acs.est.9b06636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b06636								32330020					WOS:000537151000015

As a consequence, Kunming's sustainable development has seriously hindered. The PS-InSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and the SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technologies were adopted to process the descending Sentinel-1A data stacks from July 2018 to November 2020 to monitor the land subsidence of Kunming, so as to ensure the sustainable development of the city. Moreover, the causes were analyzed. As revealed by the results, (1) the overall subsidence trend of Kunming was large in the south (Dian lakeside), whereas it was relatively small in the north. The significant subsidence areas showed major distributions in Xishan, Guandu and Jining district. The maximal average subsidence rates of PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR were -78 mm/a and -88 mm/a, respectively. (2) The ground Subsidence field of Kunming was analyzed, and the correlation coefficient R-2 of the two methods was reported as 0.997. In comparison with the leveling data of the identical period, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 6.5 mm/a and 8.5 mm/a, respectively. (3) Based on the urban subway construction data, geological structure, groundwater extraction data and precipitation, the causes of subsidence were examined. As revealed by the results, under considerable urban subways construction, special geological structures and excessive groundwater extraction, the consolidation and compression of the ground surface could cause the regional large-area subsidence. Accordingly, the monthly average precipitation in Kunming in the identical period was collected for time series analysis, thereby indicating that the land subsidence showed obvious seasonal variations with the precipitation. The results of this study can provide data support and facilitate the decision-making for land subsidence assessment, forecasting and construction planning in Kunming.

Subglacial water drainage, storage, and piracy beneath the Greenland ice sheet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Meltwater drainage across the surface of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is well constrained by measurements and modeling, yet despite its critical role, knowledge of its transit through the subglacial environment remains limited. Here we present a subglacial hydrological analysis of a land-terminating sector of the GrIS at unprecedented resolution that predicts the routing of surface-derived meltwater once it has entered the basal drainage system. Our analysis indicates the probable existence of small subglacial lakes that remain undetectable by methods using surface elevation change or radar techniques. Furthermore, the analysis suggests transient behavior with rapid switching of subglacial drainage between competing catchments driven by seasonal changes in the basal water pressure. Our findings provide a cautionary note that should be considered in studies that attempt to relate and infer future response from surface temperature, melt, and runoff from point measurements and/or modeling with measurements of proglacial discharge and ice dynamics.					; Hubbard, Alun/R-5085-2017	Doyle, Samuel/0000-0002-0853-431X; van As, Dirk/0000-0002-6553-8982; Hubbard, Alun/0000-0002-0503-3915; Lindback, Katrin/0000-0002-5941-6743													0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 28	2015	42	18					7606	7614		10.1002/2015GL065393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL065393													WOS:000363412400046

Although a great area shrinkage since the 1960s divided the lake into two parts, namely, the northern and southern basins, it still feeds millions of people from four countries around it. Given sparse in situ measurements, remote sensing with seamless spatial coverage has served for acquiring the long-term area series of Lake Chad. This study retrieves the open (unvegetated) surface water area series of Lake Chad and the total inundation area, including open water and water under macrophytes, combining multiple remote sensing data from around 1980 to 2020 with satellite-based water level and in situ observations at the Bol gauge as validation and auxiliary. Results show that the total inundation area continuously recovered at a rate of 145 km(2)/year from 1982 to 2020 with large annual fluctuations. Approximately two- to three-month time lags between the open surface water and the total inundation area reveal the hydrological asynchrony of Lake Chad, which can be attributed by the large area of rooted macrophytes. The overspill of the southern surface water flowing over the Great Barrier into the northern lake also has a one-month lag with the open surface water of the southern lake. The Google Earth Engine-based online application can be easily shared for use and data downloaded by the general public, and the open code can be adjusted for any other lakes worldwide.

The nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon compounds play an essential role in phytoplankton growth. However, the way that nutrients and phytoplankton interact and how this relationship varies seasonally in tropical freshwater ecosystems is not clear. In this study, we evaluate the relationship between phytoplankton-nutrients over the hydrological cycle in Amazonian floodplain lakes and verify if this relationship influences the biomass of cyanobacteria. We also check what factors linked to nutrients act in structuring phytoplankton community. Using the phytoplankton functional approach, we verified how their ability to respond to hydrological and environmental variations reflects the ecological conditions and investigated how these interactions work. The results show that the Amazonian floodplain lakes could maintain long-term nutrient enrichment status. The nutrients input conduces to cyanobacteria dominance, that allied to other factors, play an essential role in supporting the stability of the phytoplankton-nutrients relationship over the hydrological cycle.

J	Bergkemper, V; Weisse, T				Bergkemper, Victoria; Weisse, Thomas			Do current European lake monitoring programmes reliably estimate phytoplankton community changes?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Many European lakes are monitored according to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), with focus on phytoplankton biomass and species composition. However, the low-frequency WFD monitoring may miss short-term phytoplankton changes. This is an important issue because short-term extreme meteorological events (heat waves and heavy rain) are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change. We used records from Lake Mondsee (Austria) from 2009 to 2015 to test if a reduction from monthly to seasonal sampling affected the average annual phytoplankton biovolume. Furthermore, we combined inverted light microscopy, FlowCAM and flow cytometry to estimate the effect of sampling during extreme events on average phytoplankton biovolume. Relative to monthly sampling, seasonal sampling significantly overestimated phytoplankton biomass. A heat wave in 2015 and two episodes of heavy rain in 2015 and 2016 caused species-specific changes; biovolumes of chlorophytes and the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens (De Candolle ex Gomont) Anagnostidis & Komarek increased significantly during the heat wave. Using live material with FlowCAM and flow cytometry, we detected small and fragile cells and colonies that were either ignored or underrepresented by analysing fixed samples with light microscopy. We suggest a modified sampling and analysis strategy to capture short-term changes within the phytoplankton community.					; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023	Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2018	824	1			SI		143	162		10.1007/s10750-017-3426-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3426-6													WOS:000448578500008
J	Linder, HP				Linder, Hans Peter			East African Cenozoic vegetation history	EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY												The modern vegetation of East Africa is a complex mosaic of rainforest patches; small islands of tropic-alpine vegetation; extensive savannas, ranging from almost pure grassland to wooded savannas; thickets; and montane grassland and forest. Here I trace the evolution of these vegetation types through the Cenozoic. Paleogene East Africa was most likely geomorphologically subdued and, as the few Eocene fossil sites suggest, a woodland in a seasonal climate. Woodland rather than rainforest may well have been the regional vegetation. Mountain building started with the Oligocene trap lava flows in Ethiopia, on which rainforest developed, with little evidence of grass and none of montane forests. The uplift of the East African Plateau took place during the middle Miocene. Fossil sites indicate the presence of rainforest, montane forest and thicket, and wooded grassland, often in close juxtaposition, from 17 to 10 Ma. By 10 Ma, marine deposits indicate extensive grassland in the region and isotope analysis indicates that this was a C-3 grassland. In the later Miocene rifting, first of the western Albertine Rift and then of the eastern Gregory Rift, added to the complexity of the environment. The building of the high strato-volcanos during the later Mio-Pliocene added environments suitable for tropic-alpine vegetation. During this time, the C-3 grassland was replaced by C-4 savannas, although overall the extent of grassland was reduced from the mid-Miocene high to the current low level. Lake-level fluctuations during the Quaternary indicate substantial variation in rainfall, presumably as a result of movements in the intertropical convergence zone and the Congo air boundary, but the impact of these fluctuations on the vegetation is still speculative. I argue that, overall, there was an increase in the complexity of East African vegetation complexity during the Neogene, largely as a result of orogeny. The impact of Quaternary climatic fluctuation is still poorly understood.

The results showed the key volatile flavor compounds (ROAV >= 1) of SSF were 2,4-decadienal, p-xylene, nonanal, and 1-octen-3-ol with the relative contents of 10.33, 1.14, 4.84, and 1.76%, respectively. Furthermore, the existence of soy sauce had an enhancing role in the production of pyrazines, but no significant difference in white sugar. The contents of isovaleraldehyde and benzeneacetaldehyde were increased when white sugar was replaced with glucose, octanol, and 2-pentyl furan for fructose, no obvious difference in ribose. Moreover, the optimal ratios of soaking solutions were 20% soy sauce and 15% white sugar based on the scoring method of sensory evaluation. This study will provide a theoretical basis for the formation of volatile flavor compounds of SSF. Practical applications Grass carp usually grows in freshwater such as pond or lake, but bacteria with earthy smell are easily attached to plankton such as diatom and cyanobacteria leading to the accumulation of bad odor substances through the food chain. Shanghai smoked fish (SSF) deeply loved by public is a traditional special dish with crispy crust and delicious taste. The attractive flavor of grass carp could be increased with the help of the Maillard reaction (MR) and seasonings. Therefore, the effect of the MR on the volatile flavor compounds of SSF was investigated by HS-SPME-GC/MS in this work. A detailed study on the volatile flavor compounds of Shanghai smoked fish could not only enrich the theoretical knowledge of flavor chemistry of freshwater fish, but have a profound contribution to the development of freshwater fish processing techniques.					chen, jia/JLM-4733-2023; Zhang, Hongcai/GNP-1430-2022	Zhang, Hongcai/0000-0002-9769-463X; 													0145-8884	1745-4514				JAN	2021	45	1							e13553	10.1111/jfbc.13553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.13553		NOV 2020						33171537					WOS:000587894300001

Convergence is Only Skin Deep: Craniofacial Evolution in Electric Fishes from South America and Africa (Apteronotidae and Mormyridae)	INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY												Synopsis Apteronotidae and Mormyridae are species-rich clades of weakly electric fishes from Neotropical and Afrotropical freshwaters, respectively, known for their high morphological disparity and often regarded as a classic example of convergent evolution. Here, we use CT-imaging and 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify disparity in craniofacial morphologies, and to test the hypothesis of convergent skull-shape evolution in a phylogenetic context. For this study, we examined 391 specimens representing 78 species of Apteronotidae and Mormyridae including 30 of 37 (81%) of all valid genera with the goal to sample most of the craniofacial disparity known in these clades. We found no overlap between Apteronotidae and Mormyridae in the skull-shape morphospace using PCA and a common landmark scheme, and therefore no instances of complete phenotypic convergence. Instead, we found multiple potential instances of incomplete convergence, and at least one parallel shift among electric fish clades. The greatest components of shape variance in both families are the same as observed for most vertebrate clades: heterocephaly (i.e., opposite changes in relative sizes of the snout and braincase regions of the skull), and heterorhynchy (i.e., dorsoventral changes in relative snout flexion and mouth position). Mormyrid species examined here exhibit less craniofacial disparity than do apteronotids, potentially due to constraints associated with a larger brain size, ecological constraints related to food-type availability. Patterns of craniofacial evolution in these two clades depict a complex story of phenotypic divergence and convergence in which certain superficial similarities of external morphology obscure deeper osteological and presumably developmental differences of skull form and function. Among apteronotid and mormyrid electric fishes, craniofacial convergence is only skin deep. Spanish Resumen Apteronotidae y Mormyridae son clados ricos en especies de peces debilmente electricos de aguas dulces Neotropicales y Afrotropicales, respectivamente, conocidos por su alta disparidad morfologica y, a menudo, considerados como un ejemplo clasico de evolucion convergente. Aqui usamos imagenes de tomografia computarizada y morfometria geometrica 3D para cuantificar la disparidad en las morfologias craneofaciales y para probar la hipotesis de la evolucion convergente de la forma del craneo en un contexto filogenetico. Para este estudio, examinamos 391 especimenes que representan 78 especies de Apteronotidae y Mormyridae, incluidas 30 de 37 (81%) de todos los generos validos, con el objetivo de muestrear la mayor parte de la disparidad craneofacial conocida en estos clados. No encontramos superposicion entre Apteronotidae y Mormyridae en el morfoespacio en forma de craneo utilizando PCA y un esquema de referencia comun y, por lo tanto, no hay instancias de convergencia fenotipica completa. En cambio, encontramos multiples instancias potenciales de convergencia incompleta y al menos un cambio paralelo entre los clados de peces electricos. Los mayores componentes de la variacion de la forma en ambas familias son los mismos que se observan en la mayoria de los clados de vertebrados: heterocephaly (es decir, cambios opuestos en los tamanos relativos del hocico y las regiones de la caja craneal del craneo) y heterorhynchy (es decir, cambios dorsoventrales en la flexion relativa del hocico y posicion de la boca). Las especies de mormiridos examinadas aqui exhiben menos disparidad craneofacial que los apteronotidos, posiblemente debido a limitaciones asociadas con un tamano cerebral mas grande, limitaciones ecologicas relacionadas con la disponibilidad de tipo de alimento. Los patrones de evolucion craneofacial en estos dos clados representan una historia compleja de divergencia y convergencia fenotipica en la que ciertas similitudes superficiales de la morfologia externa oscurecen diferencias osteologicas mas profundas y presumiblemente de desarrollo de la forma y funcion del craneo. Entre los peces electricos apteronotidos y mormiridos, la convergencia craneofacial es solo superficial. German Zusammenfassung Apteronotidae und Mormyridae sind artenreiche Familien von schwach elektrischen Fischen aus Neotropischen und Afrotropischen Flussen und Seen, welche bekannt fur ihre hohe morphologische Disparitat sind und oft als klassisches Beispiel von konvergenter Evolution herangezogen werden. Hier verwenden wir Computer-Tomographische Bild gebende Verfahren (CT-Scans) und 3D geometrische Morphometrie, um die Disparitat in kraniofazialer Morphologie zu quantifizieren und die Hypothese von konvergenter Evolution bezuglich Schadel-Form in einem phylogenetischen Kontext zu testen. Fur diese Studie untersuchten wir 391 Individuen aus 78 Arten aus den beiden Familien Apteroniotidae und Mormyridae, wobei Arten 30 von 37 gultigen Gattungen (81%) benutzt wurden, mit dem Ziel, die grossten kraniofazialen Disparitaten in diesen Gruppen abzudecken. Anhand einer PCA basierend auf einem gemeinsamen Markierungs-Schema (landmarking) fanden wir keine uberlappung zwischen Apteronotidae und Mormyridae in Schadel-Form Morphospace und daher auch keine Beispiele von kompletter phanotypischer Konvergenz. Stattdessen fanden wir mehrere potenzielle Falle von inkompletter Konvergenz und mindestens einen Fall von paralleler Verschiebung zwischen diesen Gruppen von elektrischen Fischen. Die grossten Komponenten in der Varianz der Form bzw. Gestalt in beiden Familien sind dieselben, die in den meisten Wirbeltier-Gruppen beobachtet werden: heterocephaly (d.h. entgegengesetzte Veranderungen in relativer Grosse der Schnauzen- und Gehirnschadel-Region des Schadels) und heterorhynchy (d.h. dorsoventrale Veranderungen in relativer Schnauzen-Krummung und Maul-Position). Arten der Familie Mormyridae zeigen weniger kraniofaziale Disparitat als Arten der Familie Apteronotidae, moglicherweise wegen der grosseren Gehirn-Grosse und okologischer Einschrankungen in Zusammenhang mit der Verfugbarkeit von verschiedenen Nahrungsmitteltypen. Die Muster von kraniofazialer Evolution in diesen beiden Gruppen zeichnen eine komplexe Geschichte von phanotypischer Divergenz und Konvergenz in welcher gewisse oberflachhliche ahnlichkeiten der externen Morphologie tieferliegende osteologische und vermutlich entwicklungsbiologische Unterschiede in der Schadelform und -funktion uberdecken. Kraniofaziale Konvergenz geht bei den Apteronotiden und den Mormyiden nicht unter die Haut. Portuguese Resumo Apteronotidae e Mormyridae sao clados ricos em especies de peixes eletricos de fraca descarga de agua doce Neotropical e Afrotropical, respectivamente, conhecidos por sua alta disparidade morfologica e frequentemente considerado como um exemplo classico de convergencia de evolucao. Nos usamos aqui, imagens de tomografia computadorizada e morfometria geometrica 3D para quantificar a disparidade morfologica craniofacial e testar a hipotese de convergencia evolutiva da forma do cranio em um contexto filogenetico. Para este estudo, nos examinamos 391 especimes representando 78 especies de Apteronotidae e Mormyridae, incluindo 30 dos 37 (81%) generos validos com o objetivo de amostrar a maior parte da disparidade craniofacial conhecida nestes clados. Nos nao encontramos sobreposicao no morfoespaco da forma do cranio entre Apteronotidae e Mormyridae usando PCA e um esquema comum de pontos de referencia, e portanto, nenhum caso de convergencia evolutiva completa. Entretanto, nos encontramos multiplos potenciais casos de convergencia incompleta, e ao menos uma mudanca paralela entre clados de peixes eletrico. Os maiores componentes da variancia da forma nas duas familias sao os mesmos observados para a maioria dos clados dos vertebrados:: heterocephaly (i.e., mudancas opostas em tamanhos relativos do focinho e regioes da caixa craniana), e heterorhynchy (i.e., mudancas dorsoventrais na flexao relativa do focinho e posicao da boca). As especies de mormyrideos aqui examinadas, exibem menos disparidade craniofacial que os apteronotideos, potencialmente devido a limitacoes associadas com o tamanho maior do cerebro e restricoes ecologicas relacionada a disponibilidade de tipo de alimento. Padroes de evolucao craniofacial nestes dois clados ilustra uma historia complexa de divergencia fenotipica e convergencia em que certas similaridades superficiais da morfologia externa obscurece as diferencas mais profundas osteologicas e presumivelmente de desenvolvimento da forma e funcao do cranio. Entre os peixes eletricos apteronotideos e mormyrideos, a convergencia craniofacial e somente aparente.					; Albert, James/F-5166-2010; Ford, Kassandra/KLC-0875-2024	Ford, Kassandra/0000-0002-4413-2633; Peterson, Rose/0000-0002-3953-147X														2517-4843				AUG 13	2022	4	1							obac022	10.1093/iob/obac022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/iob/obac022								35976714					WOS:000840336200002

In the present study, the concentrations of ten metals were determined in mussels (Unio elongatulus eucirrus) and crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) collected from the Keban Dam Reservoir in Turkey. The significant spatial differences in concentrations of studied metals except As in mussels were not found. However, Co, Cr, Cu, and Zn concentrations in mussels and As, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn concentrations in crayfish showed significant seasonal differences. As, Cd, and Mn levels in mussels were about nine times higher than those in crayfish. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and inorganic As in crayfish and mussels were lower than maximum permissible levels. When compared with other biomonitoring studies using mussels and crayfish, high concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, and Ni in mussels and Cr and Ni in crayfish were observed due to lithogenic sources and anthropogenic activities in the basin. Bioconcentration factor values of Fe, Mn, Cd, and Zn in mussels and Zn, Cu, Fe, and Co in crayfish were > 1000, which indicates that both U. e. eucirrus and A. leptodactylus have potential to bioaccumulate these metals. Therefore, attention should be paid to mussels and crayfish from ecological and human health perspective, because they are potential vectors of metals to higher trophic levels.

This paper presents results from a pilot core from the Chew Bahir basin in southern Ethiopia that records the climatic history of the past 45 ka, with emphasis on the African Humid Period (AHP, similar to 15-5 ka calBP). Geochemical, physical and biological indicators show that Chew Bahir responded to climatic fluctuations on millennial to centennial timescales, and to the precessional cycle, since the Last Glacial Maximum. Potassium content of the sediment appears to be a reliable proxy for aridity, showing that Chew Bahir reacted to the insolation-controlled humidity increase of the AHP with a remarkably abrupt onset and a gradual termination, framing a sharply defined arid phase (similar to 12.8-11.6 ka calBP) corresponding to the Younger Dryas chronozone. The Chew Bahir record correlates well with low- and high-latitude paleoclimate records, demonstrating that the site responded to regional and global climate changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

E.; Stepina, Tatiana; del Giorgio, Paul A.; Kosten, Sarian			Methane dynamics in vegetated habitats in inland waters: quantification, regulation, and global significance	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Freshwater ecosystems, including lakes, wetlands, and running waters, are estimated to contribute over half the natural emissions of methane (CH4) globally, yet large uncertainties remain in the inland water CH4 budget. These are related to the highly heterogeneous nature and the complex regulation of the CH4 emission pathways, which involve diffusion, ebullition, and plant-associated transport. The latter, in particular, represents a major source of uncertainty in our understanding of inland water CH4 dynamics. Many freshwater ecosystems harbor habitats colonized by submerged and emergent plants, which transport highly variable amounts of CH4 to the atmosphere but whose presence may also profoundly influence local CH4 dynamics. Yet, CH4 dynamics of vegetated habitats and their potential contribution to emission budgets of inland waters remain understudied and poorly quantified. Here we present a synthesis of literature pertaining CH4 dynamics in vegetated habitats, and we (i) provide an overview of the different ways the presence of aquatic vegetation can influence CH4 dynamics (i.e., production, oxidation, and transport) in freshwater ecosystems, (ii) summarize the methods applied to study CH4 fluxes from vegetated habitats, and (iii) summarize the existing data on CH4 fluxes associated to different types of aquatic vegetation and vegetated habitats in inland waters. Finally, we discuss the implications of CH4 fluxes associated with aquatic vegetated habitats for current estimates of aquatic CH4 emissions at the global scale. The fluxes associated to different plant types and from vegetated areas varied widely, ranging from-8.6 to over 2835.8 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, but were on average high relative to fluxes in non-vegetated habitats. We conclude that, based on average vegetation coverage and average flux intensities of plant-associated fluxes, the exclusion of these habitats in lake CH4 balances may lead to a major underestimation of global lake CH4 emissions. This synthesis highlights the need to incorporate vegetated habitats into CH4 emission budgets from natural freshwater ecosystems and further identifies understudied research aspects and relevant future research directions.

Seasonal and spatial variability of dissolved organic matter composition in the lower Amazon River	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We analyzed the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the lower Amazon River (ca. 850 km from A"bidos to the mouth) using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and geochemical tracers. Changes in DOM composition along this lower reach suggest a transition from higher plant-derived DOM to more algal/microbial-derived DOM. This result was likely due to a combination of autochthonous production, alteration of terrigenous DOM as it transits down the river, and increased algal inputs from floodplain lakes and clearwater tributaries during high discharge conditions. Spatial gradients in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied with discharge. Maximal DOC concentrations were observed near the mouth during high water, highlighting the importance of lateral inputs of DOM along the lower river. The majority of DOM molecular formulae did not change within the time it takes the water in the mainstem to be transported through the lower reach. This is indicative of molecules representing a mixture of compounds that are resistant to rapid alteration and reactive compounds that are continuously replenished by the lateral input of terrestrial organic matter from the landscape, tributaries, and floodplains. River water incubations revealed that photo- and bio-transformation alter at most 30% of the DOM molecular formulae. River discharge at the mouth differed from the sum of discharge measurements made at A"bidos and the main gauged tributaries in the lower Amazon. This indicates that changes in hydrology and associated variations in the source waters along the lower reach affected the molecular composition of the DOM that is being transported from the Amazon River to the coastal ocean.					; Dittmar, Thorsten/L-7796-2013; Ward, Nicholas/HGB-9389-2022; Yager, Patricia/K-8020-2014; Ward, Nicholas/B-4824-2016	Krusche, Alex/0000-0001-7094-5577; Dittmar, Thorsten/0000-0002-3462-0107; Seidel, Michael/0000-0003-0934-1939; Yager, Patricia/0000-0002-8462-6427; Ward, Nicholas/0000-0001-6174-5581													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2016	131	3					281	302		10.1007/s10533-016-0279-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-016-0279-4													WOS:000391423900003

In this paper, we investigated the temporal and spatial variations in evaporation and the associated radiation and energy fluxes across Lake Taihu, China with an eddy covariance mesonet consisting of three lake sites and one land site. The results indicate that on the diurnal scale, water heat storage showed a similar behavior to net radiation with comparable magnitudes and fueled the substantial nighttime evaporation (48% of annual evaporation). Unlike boreal deep lakes, the monthly mean sensible and latent heat flux was tightly coupled with seasonal variations in net radiation at this large (size 2400 km(2)), subtropical (30.9-31.6 degrees N) shallow (mean depth 1.9 m) Lake Taihu. On the monthly to annual scales, the radiation and energy fluxes showed little spatial variations across the lake, indicating a lack of sensitivity to wind speed, water depth, water quality and the presence of submerged macrophytes. The annual mean Bowen ratio (0.12-0.13) of the lake was lower than those found in the literature for subtropical and northern lakes and also much lower than that observed at the adjacent land site (0.58). The experimental data were used to evaluate the performance of 19 lake evaporation models of varying complexities. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this experiment, three ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), were established using data collected in the field for different years and some environmental variables, After the accuracy validation of the model, XGBoost had the highest accuracy of salinity prediction in this study area, with RMSE of 17.62 dS m(-1), R-2 of 0.73 and RPIQ of 2.45 in the test set. In this experiment, after Spearman correlation analysis of soil Electrical Conductivity (EC) with environmental variables, we found that the near-infrared band in the original band, the DEM in the topographic factor, the vegetation index based on remote sensing, and the salinity index soil EC had a strong correlation. The spatial distribution of salinization is generally characterized by good in the west and north and severe in the east and south. Non-salinization, light salinization, and moderate salinization gradually expanded southward and eastward from the interior of the western oasis over 25 years. Severe and very severe salinization gradually shifted from the northern edge of the oasis to the eastern and southeastern desert areas during the 25 years. The saline soils with the highest salinity class were distributed in most of the desert areas in the eastern part of the Werigan-Kuqa Oasis study area as well as in smaller areas in the west in 1996, shrinking in size and characterized by a discontinuous distribution by 2021. In terms of area change, the non-salinized area increased from 198.25 in 1996 to 1682.47 km(2) in 2021. The area of saline soil with the highest salinization level decreased from 5708.77 in 1996 to 2246.87 km(2) in 2021. overall, the overall salinization of the Werigan-Kuqa Oasis improved.

Impact of Urban Stormwater Runoff on Cyanobacteria Dynamics in A Tropical Urban Lake	WATER												Worldwide, eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs are a great concern for water resources management. Coupling a catchment hydrological model and a lake model has been a strategy to assess the impact of land use, agricultural practices and climate change on water quality. However, research has mainly focused on large lakes, while urban reservoirs and their catchments, especially in tropical regions, are still poorly studied despite the wide range of ecosystem services they provide. An integrated modelling approach coupling the hydrological model Storm Water Management Model SWMM and the lake ecological model DYRESM-CAEDYM is proposed for Lake Pampulha (Brazil). Scenarios of increased imperviousness of the catchment and of reduction in the load of nutrients and total suspended solids (TSS) in dry weather inflow were simulated. Runoff water quality simulations presented a fair performance for TSS and ammonium (NH4+) while the dynamics of total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate (NO3-) were poorly captured. Phytoplankton dynamics in the lake were simulated with good accuracy (Normalized Mean Absolute Error, NMAE = 0.24 and r = 0.89 in calibration period; NMAE = 0.55 and r = 0.54 in validation period). The general trends of growth, decline and the magnitude of phytoplankton biomass were well represented most of the time. Scenario simulations suggest that TP reduction will decrease cyanobacteria biomass and delay its peaks as a consequence of orthophosphate (PO43-) concentration reduction in the lake surface layers. However, even decreasing TP load into Lake Pampulha by half would not be sufficient to achieve the water quality objective of a maximum concentration of 60 mu g chla L-1. Increased imperviousness in the catchment will raise runoff volume, TSS, TP and NO3- loads into Lake Pampulha and promote greater cyanobacteria biomass, mainly in the beginning of the wet season, because of additional nutrient input from catchment runoff. Recovering Lake Pampulha water quality will require the improvement of the sanitation system. The lake water quality improvement will also require more sustainable and nature-based solutions for urban drainage in order to reduce non-point pollution through infiltration and retention of stormwater and to enhance natural processes, such as chemical sorption, biodegradation and phytoremediation. The integrated modelling approach here proposed can be applied for other urban reservoirs taking advantage of existing knowledge on Lake Pampulha.

Seasonal inundation patterns of these isolated lakes can be misestimated in a hydrodynamic model due to their short and erratic appearances. A surface water time series of Poyang Lake having an 8-day revisit frequency with a 30 m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2016 was conducted for the first time. This study was produced with a modified hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (HSTAFM) by integrating both Landsat and MODIS data. Discrepancies between model-based surface water and remotely-sensed surface water were evaluated, and possible causes were discussed. Results show that the modified HSTAFM can better detect the water features of a floodplain, thereby providing more detailed information in an seasonal isolated lake system than the MODIS MOD13Q1 product. With the fusion product, we found that Poyang Lake evidently shrank after experiencing a longer low-water period after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. A large proportion of these discrepancies (averaging 36%) between model-based and remotely-sensed surface water distributed in seasonal isolated lakes, mainly occurred during high-water level periods. Uncertainties in the hydrodynamic model might attribute to smaller defined lake boundaries, bathymetric variations, human disturbance, and unconsidered groundwater recharge/discharge. These results provide a new insight into the temporally continuous and spatially dynamic assessment of simulated surface water, which is essential for the future improvement in the hydrodynamic model.

We investigated the virome of honey bees collected at the end of the beekeeping season (August/September) in Czechia, a Central European country. Samples were examined in biological replicates to assess the homogeneity, stability, and composition of the virome inside a single hive. By choice of healthy workers from colonies, where Varroa destructor was under control, we could identify ubiquitous bee viruses. Deformed wing virus (DWV) was highly prevalent, even though the bees were healthy, without any noticeable disease signs. The overall virome composition (consisting of honey bee-, plant-, and bacterium-infecting viruses) was driven primarily by the hive and its location. However, honey bee-specific viruses showed an uneven distribution within the same hive. In addition, our results point to an unusual cooccurrence between two rhabdoviruses and reveal the presence of five distinct lineages of Lake Sinai viruses (LSVs) clustering with other LSV strains described globally. Comparison of our results with the virome of Australian honey bees, the last truly Varroa- and DWV-free population, showed a strong difference with respect to DWV and a set of diverse members of the Picornavirales, of which the latter were absent in our samples. We hypothesize that the occurrence of DWV introduced by Varroa strongly affects the virome structure despite the mite being under control. IMPORTANCE The Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, is a vital part of our ecosystem as well as cultural heritage. Annual colony losses endanger beekeeping. In this study, we examined healthy bees from the heart of Central Europe, where honey bee colonies have been commonly affected by varroosis over 5 decades. Our virome analysis showed the presence of ubiquitous viruses in colonies where the mite Varroa destructor was under control and no honey bee disease signs were observed. Compared to previous studies, an important part of our study was the analysis of multiple replicates from individual hives. Our overall results indicate that the virome structure (including bee-infecting viruses, plant-infecting viruses, and bacteriophages) is stable within hives; however, the bee-infecting viruses varied largely within interhive replicates, suggesting variation of honey bee viruses within individual bees. Of interest was the striking difference between the viromes of our 39 pools and 9 pools of honey bee viromes previously analyzed in Australia. It could be suggested that Varroa not only affects DWV spread in bee colonies but also affects diverse members of the Picornavirales, which were strongly decreased in Czech bees compared to the Varroa- and DWV-naive Australian bees.

We present laser-ablation strontium and carbon isotope data from 25 cattle (Bos taurus) to reconstruct mobility and infer herding management at the Swiss lakeside settlement of Arbon Bleiche 3, occupied for only 15 years (3384-3370 BC). Our results reveal three distinct isotopic patterns that likely reflect different herding strategies: 1) localized cattle herding, 2) seasonal movement, and 3) herding away from the site year-round. Different strategies of herding are not uniformly represented in various areas of the settlement, which indicates specialist modes of cattle management. The pressure on local fodder capacities and the need for alternative herding regimes must have involved diverse access to grazing resources. Consequently, the increasing importance of cattle in the local landscape was likely to have contributed to the progress of socio-economic differentiation in early agricultural societies in Europe.					; Lehmann, Moritz F./A-3301-2014; Lehmann, Moritz/A-3301-2014; Kuhn, Thomas/KIH-7973-2024	Heyd, Volker/0000-0002-0889-6513; Lehmann, Moritz F./0000-0003-0626-5942; Gerling, Claudia/0000-0003-4619-7032; Kuhn, Thomas/0009-0001-1923-8946; Pike, Alistair/0000-0002-5610-8948													1932-6203					JUL 26	2017	12	7							e0180164	10.1371/journal.pone.0180164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180164								28746367					WOS:000406371800009

In addition to the yield-improving approaches, scientists began to assess the multiple cropping potential as an alternative for intensification. These existing assessments largely focused on the number of multiple cropping frequency (MCF) while ignoring the crop growth duration (GD) required by a complete cropping circle, which may bring uncertainty on the estimates. In this study, we aim to address such uncertainty by comprehensively considering the relation between MCF and GD. Selecting Jinxian county, Jiangxi Province, as a study area, we use time-series remote sensing imageries to observe MCF and GD, and to estimate the region's annual growing season (GS) by aggregating the crop-specific GDs corresponding to the MCF. We further apply scenario analysis to understand how crop choice. i.e. longer GD v.s. shorter GD, would influence the exploitation of GS and thus the multiple cropping potential. Results show that without considering GD, 33.63% croplands have the potential to harvest another time and 64.84% cropland could have two-extra harvests, which would result in the harvested area increased by + 163.31%. However, if GD is considered, this potential is estimated much lower in overall and is varied greatly across crop selection scenarios. In the most close-to-reality scenario, roughly 40% croplands have no potential to make extra harvest, because the GS in many areas have been largely exploited and the remaining GS is insufficient to sustain another complete crop growth. Our study shows that crop choice plays an important role in measuring and exploiting the multiple cropping potential, which provides implications for China's "agricultural supply-side structural reform" through sustainable land use intensification.					shi, zhou/A-2283-2015; shi, Zhou/M-7845-2019; Yu, Qiangyi/AFR-0194-2022	shi, zhou/0000-0003-3914-5402; 													0264-8377	1873-5754				JAN	2022	112								105846	10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105846													WOS:000718124700005

FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												When considering microbial biotic interactions, viruses as well as eukaryotic grazers are known to be important components of aquatic microbial food webs. It might be the same for bacterivorous bacteria but these groups have been comparatively less studied. This is typically the case of the Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs), which are obligate bacterial predators of other bacteria. Recently, the abundance and distribution of three families of this functional group were investigated in perialpine lakes, revealing their presence and quantitative importance. Here, a more in-depth analysis is provided for Lake Geneva regarding the diversity of these bacterial predators at different seasons, sites and depths. We reveal a seasonal and spatial (vertical) pattern for BALOs. They were also found to be relatively diverse (especially Bdellovibrionaceae) and assigned to both known and unknown phylogenetic clusters. At last we found that most BALOs were positively correlated to other bacterial groups, mainly Gram-negative, in particular Myxococcales (among which many are predators of other microbes). This study is the first shedding light on this potentially important bacterial killing group in a large and deep lake.					; Desdevises, Yves/D-5528-2011; Desdevises, Yves/H-5334-2019; Jacquet, Stéphan/AAJ-7846-2021	JACQUET, Stephan/0000-0001-6017-3892; Desdevises, Yves/0000-0001-9774-0336; Ezzedine, Jade A/0000-0001-7884-8675; 														1664-302X				FEB 14	2020	11								98	10.3389/fmicb.2020.00098	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00098								32117128					WOS:000517551700001

This article provides a general overview of the previous works that have been completed in monitoring and analyzing heavy metals. The intention of this review is to introduce the historical studies to distinguish and understand the previous challenges faced by researchers in analyzing heavy metal accumulation. In addition, this review introduces a survey on the importance of time increment sampling (monthly and/or seasonally) to comprehend and determine the rate of change of different parameters on a monthly and seasonal basis. Furthermore, suggestions are made for future research to achieve more understandable figures on heavy metal accumulation by considering climate conditions. Thus, the intent of the current study is the provision of reliable models for predicting future heavy metal accumulation in water bodies in different climates and pollution conditions so that water management can be achieved using intelligent proactive strategies and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques.

J	Ulyshen, MD				Ulyshen, Michael D.			Arthropod vertical stratification in temperate deciduous forests: Implications for conservation-oriented management	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Studies on the vertical distribution patterns of arthropods in temperate deciduous forests reveal highly stratified (i.e., unevenly vertically distributed) communities. These patterns are determined by multiple factors acting simultaneously, including: (1) time (forest age, season, time of day); (2) forest structure (height, vertical foliage complexity, plant surface textures, tree cavities); (3) plant community composition (plant diversity, invasive species); (4) climatic gradients (light exposure, temperature, wind speed, humidity): (5) resource availability (foliage, sugars, wood, epiphytes, carrion, dung, prey, hosts, mates); (6) inter-specific interactions (predation, interference, competition) and (7) logistics (dispersal abilities, proximity to emergence sites, open flight zones). Several recommendations can be made with respect to incorporating canopy habitats and resources into management plans in order to maintain diverse forest arthropod communities. Efforts should be made to maintain diverse plant communities, for instance, including eliminating or controlling invasive plant competitors. Protecting large diameter trees and snags is also important, especially for a wide variety of canopy arthropod taxa associated with standing or suspended dead wood, tree cavities and epiphytes. Finally, it is essential to ensure adequate spatial and temporal continuity in the availability of these and other key resources. Although how to best achieve this last objective remains an active area of research, it may be preferable to retain clusters of trees as opposed to isolated individuals.

J	Guimaraes, BMDM; Neto, IEL				Guimaraes, Bruna Monallize Duarte Moura; Neto, Iran Eduardo Lima			Chlorophyll-a prediction in tropical reservoirs as a function of hydroclimatic variability and water quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The study goal was to determine spatiotemporal variations in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration using models that combine hydroclimatic and nutrient variables in 150 tropical reservoirs in Brazil. The investigation of seasonal variability indicated that Chl-a varied in response to changes in total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), volume (V), and daily precipitation (P). Therefore, an empirical model for Chl-a prediction based on the product of TN, TP, and normalized functions of V and P was proposed, but their individual exponents as well as a general multiplicative factor were adjusted by linear regression for each reservoir. The fitted relationships were capable of representing algal temporal dynamics and blooms, with an average coefficient of determination of R-2 = 0.70. The results revealed that nutrients yielded better predictability of Chl-a than hydroclimatic variables. Chl-a blooms presented seasonal and interannual variability, being more frequent in periods of high precipitation and low volume. The equations demonstrate different Chl-a responses to the parameters. In general, Chl-a was positively related to TN and/or TP. However, in some cases (22%), high nutrient concentrations reduced Chl-a, which was attributed to limited phytoplankton growth driven by light deficiency due to increased turbidity. In 49% of the models, precipitation intensified Chl-a levels, which was related to increases in the nutrient concentration from external sources in rural watersheds. Contrastingly, 51% of the reservoirs faced a decrease in Chl-a with precipitation, which can be explained by the opposite effect of dilution of nutrient concentration at the reservoir inlet in urban watersheds. In terms of volume, in 67% of the reservoirs, water level reduction promoted an increase in Chl-a as a response to higher nutrient concentration. In the other cases, Chl-a decreased with lower water levels due to wind-induced destratification of the water column, which potentially decreased the internal nutrient release from bottom sediment. Finally, applying the model to the two largest studied reservoirs showed greater sensitivity of Chl-a to changes in water use classes regarding variations in TN, followed by TP, V, and P.

B) and non-native (Hoplias mbigua) trahira in a Neotropical floodplain. We hypothesised that during the dry season both species inhabit isolated sites (i.e. lakes) and thus rely on distinct food resources to sustain their coexistence. We found evidence of trophic segregation among native and non-native freshwater fish in the Upper Parana River, Brazil. Even though both species rely on the same primary littoral carbon sources and present similar trophic diversity, trophic segregation was attained through larger niche amplitude and smaller isotopic niche width for the non-native fish. Three decades after initial invasion, non-native Hoplias have distinct foraging behaviour and do not compete for trophic resources with native trahira; this is likely due to morpho-anatomical differences. Limited morphological similarity between these congeneric species might be the strongest factor contributing to their coexistence in the Parana River floodplain during the dry season.					; Cionek, Vivian/P-7911-2017; Alves, Gustavo/JBJ-7206-2023; Benedito, Evanilde/F-2418-2012	de Mello Cionek, Vivian/0000-0002-0879-690X; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2020	29	4					602	610		10.1111/eff.12536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12536		FEB 2020											WOS:000512159500001

Here, we apply Vector Autoregressive Moving Average models with eXogenous variables (VARMAX) statistical models to project hydrological discharge for 23 river catchments for the 2015-2100 period, under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), namely RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. We show an intensification of future annual rainfall by 25% in the eastern and 5-10% in the western part of the basin. At higher emission scenarios, the October to December season receives more rainfall than the March to May season. Temperature projections show a substantial increase in the mean annual minimum temperature by 1.3-4.5 degrees C and warming in the colder season (June to September) by 1.7-2.9 degrees C under RCP 4.5 and 4.9 degrees C under RCP 8.5 by 2085. Variability in future river discharge ranges from 5-267%, increases with emission intensity, and is the highest in rivers in the southern and south eastern parts of the basin. The flow trajectories reveal no systematic trends but suggest marked inter-annual variation, primarily in the timing and magnitude of discharge peaks and lows. The projections imply the need for coordinated transboundary river management in the future.

Changes in hydrologic pulses may change the surroundings of the organism and then affect their distribution and community structure. Here, based on the data from a rainy season and a dry season, the water quality, heavy metal in the sediment and macrozoobenthos community structure in two shallow lakes, Nansihu Lake (NSH) and Dongpinghu Lake (DPH, were analyzed. The results showed that the water diversion pulse participated in the influence of runoff pulse on NSH and DPH. The macrozoobenthos community in NSH and DPH were similar after the hydrologic pulse changed, this might be due to these two lakes were connected by the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP). Along the direction of water transfer, the macrozoobenthos communities were gradually dominated by small-size species with as water quality decreased. Compared with community structure before the SNWTP, the macrozoobenthos changed from dominant aquatic insect to dominant Mollusca in NSH, and changed from dominant Mollusca and Oligochaeta to dominant Mollusca in DPH. The water diversion pulse, in which the direction of water transfer was opposite to that of natural water flow, affected the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorous in water and heavy metals in sediment. In addition, the introduction of exogenous water caused by the SNWTP changed water quality and heavy metals content in the sediment and water depth in NSH and DPH. These changes together affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos. These findings enable a better understanding of the ecological impact of intense hydrologic pulse changes caused by water transfer projects.					; 李, 庆/KHU-5504-2024; 王, 鸿麒/OEO-4528-2025	Shrestha, Sangam/0000-0002-4972-3969; Wang, Guoqiang/0000-0002-3976-1056; Xue, Bao-Lin/0000-0002-4479-7889; Sun, Wenchao/0000-0001-7607-4346													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2020	584								124755	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124755													WOS:000527390200065

Depending on the purpose, this may not be sufficient. There are more accurate methods for determining COP, but they may not be used due to complexity, nonlinearity, or limited application of advanced COP estimation methods. Here, we present a new COP approximation method suitable for HPs and chillers. It is based on linear relationships and was developed from a thermodynamic two-stage HP model for design and off-design operation using ammonia as a refrigerant. This approximation method was then applied to a case study investigating the potential of district heating supplied by HPs in Tallinn, Estonia. Groundwater, sewage water, seawater, river water, lake water, and a district cooling return line were explored as potential heat sources. The results show a deviation in COP of less than 1.5% compared to the thermodynamic model. Annual calculations show the applicability of the COP approximation method for calculating hourly COPs at different heat source and heat sink temperatures, as well as changing heat loads, seasonal COP, heat demand ratio, and hourly Lorenz efficiency.

J	Lew, S; Glinska-Lewczuk, K				Lew, Sylwia; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna			Environmental controls on the abundance of methanotrophs and methanogens in peat bog lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The aim of the present study was to identify the factors that influence the composition of methanogens and methanotrophs in the background prokaryotic community in peat bog lakes. We hypothesized that the microbial composition is a function of the physicochemical conditions of the water and a function of depth-dependent oxygen (DO) concentrations. To address this aim, we collected water samples from subsurface and near-bottom layers, representing oxic and anoxic conditions in 4 peat bog lakes in NE Poland. The structure of methanogenic Archaea and methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) was determined with double labeled-fluorescence in situ hybridization (DOPE-FISH). The results showed significant differences in Procaryota communities between the oxic (subsurface) and suboxic/anoxic (near-bottom) layers in peat bog lakes (t-test, p < 0.05). The methanogens from the Archaea domain were observed in anoxic periods, while methanotrophs were present regardless of water depth and season. The abundance of methanogens was inversely correlated with DO and CO2. Methanotrophs adapted better to the changing habitat conditions. The nonmetrical multidimensional scaling (NMS) and partial least square regression (PLS-R) models showed that the methanotrophs in subsurface layers are positively associated with temperature, DOC, and TON while negatively associated with pH. The DO availability is not a prerequisite condition for the presence of methanothrophs. The most important factors for MOB at the bottom were CO2 and TON. Due to a significant role of methanotrophs in the control of the methane emission flux rates, there is a need for further research on factors responsible for methanotroph development in peat bog lakes.

J	Mishra, S; Stumpf, RP; Schaeffer, BA; Werdell, J				Mishra, Sachidananda; Stumpf, Richard P.; Schaeffer, Blake A.; Werdell, Jeremy			Recent changes in cyanobacteria algal bloom magnitude in large lakes across the contiguous United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes produce large quantities of biomass that impact drinking water systems, recreation, and tourism and may produce toxins that can adversely affect public health. This study analyzed nine years of satellite-derived bloom records and compared how the bloom magnitude has changed from 2008-2011 to 2016-2020 in 1881 of the largest lakes across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We determined bloom magnitude each year as the spatio-temporal mean cyanobacteria biomass from May to October and in concentrations of chlorophyll-a. We found that bloom magnitude decreased in 465 (25 %) lakes in the 2016-2020 period. Conversely, there was an increase in bloom magnitude in only 81 lakes (4 %). Bloom magnitude either didn't change, or the observed change was in the uncertainty range in the majority of the lakes (n = 1335, 71 %). Above-normal wetness and normal or below-normal maximum temperature over the warm season may have caused the decrease in bloom magnitude in the eastern part of the CONUS in recent years. On the other hand, a hotter and dryer warm season in the western CONUS may have created an environment for increased algal biomass. While more lakes saw a decrease in bloom magnitude, the pattern was not monotonic over the CONUS. The variations in temporal changes in bloom magnitude within and across climatic regions depend on the interactions between land use land cover (LULC) and physical factors such as temperature and precipitation.

However, CO2 emissions from lakes in urban landscapes are generally overlooked despite their daily connections to human activity. Furthermore, the role of management actions in CO2 emissions remained unclear mostly because of the lack of long-term observations. Here, the CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) from two urban lakes (Lake Wuli and Lake Donghu) in eastern China were investigated based on 16-year (2002-2017) field mea-surements. This long-term measurements showed the annual mean pCO2 were 1150 & PLUSMN; 612 & mu;atm for Lake Wuli and 1143 & PLUSMN; 887 & mu;atm for Lake Donghu, with corresponding estimated flux of 21.12 & PLUSMN; 19.60 mmol m � 2 d-1 and 16.42 & PLUSMN; 20.39 mmol m � 2 d 1, respectively. This indicates significant CO2 evasion into the atmosphere. Strong links between CO2 and human-derived nutrients (e.g., ammonium) and dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, and trophic state index were found. Although pCO2 was relatively uniform across sites and seasons in each lake, substantial inter-annual variability with significant decreasing trends were found. The decrease in annual CO2 can be partly explained by the reduction of pollutant loadings with management actions, which held the hypotheses that management actions mitigated the CO2 emission risks. Overall, management actions (e.g., ecological restoration and municipal engineering) should be considered for better understanding the roles of anthropogenic aquatic ecosystems in carbon cycle.					; Xiao, Wei/G-6586-2012; Qi, Tianci/IRZ-2645-2023; Qiu, Yinguo/IZD-6490-2023; Duan, Hongtao/B-7210-2011; Luo, Juhua/Q-9942-2019	Xiao, Qitao/0000-0003-4255-3183; Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 15	2023	344								118626	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118626		JUL 2023						37453296					WOS:001043558600001

A complete understanding of long-term variations of habitat configurations is therefore critical. Poyang Lake in China contains a large and stable population of the Yangtze finless porpoise, a critically endangered freshwater cetacean species. However, constant water decline and intensified human activities in the lake since 2000 have led to uncertainty for porpoise conservation. Weaddress this issue via remote sensing and hydrodynamic modeling of nine environmental variables during different seasons over the past two decades. The MaxEnt model was used to extrapolate changes in likely habitat configurations of the porpoise, andMARXAN algorithms delineated habitat protection priorities in different seasons. Results illustrate that flow velocity, water depth, Chl-a concentration, distance to grassland and boats greatly affect the porpoise distribution. Shifts in these environmental variables can lead to significant habitat decreases in all seasons. In particular, unstable hydrological regimes may force the porpoises to live in habitats with lower water depths for suitable flow velocity conditions in the dry season, and habitats are increasingly infringed by grassland and mudflats. High protection priority areas such as the northern channel and the estuaries of the tributaries urgently need long-term systematic and targeted surveys of ecosystem functionality and flexible management of anthropogenic activities. Combining remote sensing with hydrodynamic and species distribution models can also assist in understanding the situation of other aquatic species.					; Li, Qiyue/GON-3433-2022; Wang, Weiping/LMP-1770-2024; Li, Wenya/B-5361-2011	Li, Qiyue/0000-0002-7990-0671; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2022	838		1						155954	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155954								35580683					WOS:000989655300011

This is demonstrated using Qinghai Lake, Tibetan Plateau, as a case study. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values obtained from the cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) constellation over four ice seasons (2018 to 2022) were used to examine the impact of lake surface conditions on reflected GNSS signals during open water and ice cover seasons. A moving t-test algorithm was applied to time-varying SNR values allowing for the detection of lake ice at daily temporal resolution. Good agreement was achieved between ice phenology records derived from CYGNSS data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. The CYGNSS timings for freeze-up, i.e., the period starting with the first appearance of ice on the lake (freeze-up start; FUS) until the lake becomes fully ice covered (freeze-up end; FUE), as well as those for breakup, i.e., the period beginning with the first pixel of open water (breakup start; BUS) and ending when the whole lake becomes ice-free (breakup end; BUE), were validated against the phenology dates derived from MODIS images. Mean absolute errors are 7, 5, 10, 4, and 5 days for FUS, FUE, BUS, BUE, and ice cover duration, respectively. Observations revealed the sensitivity of GNSS reflected signals to surface melt prior to the appearance of open water conditions as determined from MODIS, which explains the larger difference of 10 days for BUS.

The bio-optical parameters, i.e., chlorophyll-a (Chl-a, in mg center dot m-3) and turbidity (in NTU) were measured in situ during a satellite overpass to minimize the impact of atmospheric distortions. To calibrate the satellite images, various atmospheric correction methods (including ACOLITE, C2RCC, iCOR, and LaSRC) were evaluated during the image preprocessing phase. Spectral signatures obtained from the scenes for each atmospheric correction method were then compared with spectral signatures acquired in situ on the water surface. In short, the ACOLITE model emerged as the best fit for the calibration process, reaching R2 values of 0.88 and 0.79 for Chl-a and turbidity, respectively. This underlies the importance of using inversion models, when processing water surfaces, to mitigate errors due to aerosols and the sun-glint effect. Subsequently, reflectance data derived from the ACOLITE model were used to establish correlations between various spectral indices and the in situ data. The empirical retrieval models (based on band combinations) yielding superior performance, with higher R2 values, were subjected to a rigorous statistical validation and optimization by applying a bootstrapping approach. From this process the green chlorophyll index (GCI) was selected as the optimal choice for constructing the Chl-a retrieval model, reaching an R2 of 0.88, while the red + NIR spectral index achieved the highest R2 value (0.79) for turbidity analysis, although in the last case, it was necessary to incorporate data from several seasons for an adequate model training. Our analysis covered a broad spectrum of dates, seasons, and years, which allowed us to search deeper into the evolution of the trophic state associated with the lake. We identified a striking eight-year period (2014-2022) characterized by a decline in Chl-a concentration in the lake, possibly attributable to governmental measures in the region for the protection and conservation of the lake. Additionally, the OLI imagery showed a spatial pattern varying from higher Chl-a values in the northern zone compared to the southern zone, probably due to the heat island effect of the northern urban areas. The results of this study suggest a positive effect of recent local regulations and serve as the basis for the creation of a modern monitoring system that enhances traditional point-based methods, offering a holistic view of the ongoing processes within the lake.					; Frappart, Frédéric/AAB-8558-2019; Cristobal, Jordi/K-8021-2013; Velasquez, German/AFP-4968-2022; Pons, Xavier/N-1202-2014; Yepez, Santiago/JXM-5144-2024; Cristóbal, Jordi/K-8021-2013	Rodriguez Lopez, Lien/0000-0002-0550-0253; Cristobal, Jordi/0000-0001-6244-4289; Frappart, Frederic/0000-0002-4661-8274; Pons, Xavier/0000-0002-6924-1641; Yepez, Santiago/0000-0002-7879-7094; 														2072-4292				JAN	2024	16	2							427	10.3390/rs16020427	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16020427													WOS:001151550100001
J	Hao, ZC; Hao, FH; Singh, VP				Hao, Zengchao; Hao, Fanghua; Singh, Vijay P.			A general framework for multivariate multi-index drought prediction based on Multivariate Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (MESP)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Drought is among the costliest natural hazards worldwide and extreme drought events in recent years have caused huge losses to various sectors. Drought prediction is therefore critically important for providing early warning information to aid decision making to cope with drought. Due to the complicated nature of drought, it has been recognized that the univariate drought indicator may not be sufficient for drought characterization and hence multivariate drought indices have been developed for drought monitoring. Alongside the substantial effort in drought monitoring with multivariate drought indices, it is of equal importance to develop a drought prediction method with multivariate drought indices to integrate drought information from various sources. This study proposes a general framework for multivariate multi-index drought prediction that is capable of integrating complementary prediction skills from multiple drought indices. The Multivariate Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (MESP) is employed to sample from historical records for obtaining statistical prediction of multiple variables, which is then used as inputs to achieve multivariate prediction. The framework is illustrated with a linearly combined drought index (LDI), which is a commonly used multivariate drought index, based on climate division data in California and New York in the United States with different seasonality of precipitation. The predictive skill of LDI (represented with persistence) is assessed by comparison with the univariate drought index and results show that the LDI prediction skill is less affected by seasonality than the meteorological drought prediction based on SPI. Prediction results from the case study show that the proposed multivariate drought prediction outperforms the persistence prediction, implying a satisfactory performance of multivariate drought prediction. The proposed method would be useful for drought prediction to integrate drought information from various sources for early drought warning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The early diverging fungal lineages are known to be prominent parasites of phytoplankton. However, due to missing fungal reference data, their identity and ecology remain mostly unknown. To overcome this problem, we combined single-spore-based DNA barcoding during one sampling season of the eutrophic Lake Inba (Japan), which is dominated by two diatoms. By linking microscopically picked single fungal spore on two diatoms to subsequent DNA barcoding of ribosomal maker genes, we identified 12 distinct lineages, affiliated not only to the known parasitic phylum Chytridiomycota (chytrids), but also to the enigmatic phyla Rozellomycota and Aphelidiomycota. The detected Rozellomycota could be a hyperparasite of parasitic chytrid infecting diatoms. Host specificity appeared to be different among clades. However, the barcoding of single-spore DNA could not clearly prove host specificity due to the limited number of samples and resolution in the targeted gene regions. The degree of host specificity was thus confirmed by the cross-infection experiments. Five chytrid strains were generalists infecting all four diatoms strains, while the remaining three strains of chytrids were specialists exhibiting host preferences. Additional growth experiments indicated a trade-off between host specificity and growth rate, so that generalists with more possible hosts grew slower than specialists with one host. Our results suggest that the combination of microscopy with single-spore-based barcoding is a promising approach to evaluate the complex host-parasite interactions, while infection experiments can verify the interactions and shed light on the underlying ecological principles.

Toxic cyanobacterial blooms present an ever-increasing serious threat to both the quality of drinking water and recreational uses and severely disrupt aquatic ecosystems, worldwide. In many cases, such blooms are dominated by toxic Microcystis sp. that produce a family of structurally similar hepatotoxins, known as microcystins (MCs). Here we present a retrospective analysis of Microcystis seasonal blooms from Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel) indicating that the population is composed of at least 25 different genotypes and two different chemo-types, whose relative abundance changes over decades. Based on a long-term record of biotic and abiotic parameters and laboratory experiments we propose that minor increase in water temperature, but not in salinity, may affect Microcystis community structure by changing the relative abundance of species/strains from toxic to less or non-toxic species.					; Ninio, Shira/HSD-7221-2023	Ninio, Shira/0000-0002-9433-2182; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				FEB	2020	92								101710	10.1016/j.hal.2019.101710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2019.101710								32113609					WOS:000519335700022

The lakes differed in terms of hydrology, among others in the degree/type of their connection with the river (permanent, temporary and no connection). The study was conducted during the growing seasons in the years 2006-2013 and involved the lower Vistula River and three floodplain lakes: isolated, transitional and connected. Water samples were collected biweekly from April to September. Zooplankton was the most diverse and abundant in the transitional lake (the highest Shannon alpha-diversity index H' and Pielou's evenness index J'). The gentle washing of the lakes might have stimulated the development of zooplankton in accordance with the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis. The diversity and density of zooplankton were higher in the connected lake compared to the isolated one. We confirmed the hypothesis that zooplankton should be more abundant and diverse in floodplain lakes connected with the river (or transitional) than in isolated ones. Zooplankton analyses indicated that hydrological conditions (flood-pulse regime) contributed most substantially to zooplankton diversity and density in the floodplain lakes of the lower Vistula valley.					; Napiórkowski, Paweł/G-6228-2014; Napiorkowski, Pawel/G-6228-2014	Szymanska - Walkiewicz, Monika/0000-0003-4319-4231; Mrozinska, Natalia/0000-0003-4842-4139; Bakowska, Martyna/0000-0001-5887-1456; Napiorkowski, Pawel/0000-0003-1987-9468; Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0001-9361-0286														2073-4441				SEP	2019	11	9							1924	10.3390/w11091924	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091924													WOS:000488834400187

To simulate the stream flow of the ungauged zone, we built a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model for the entire catchment area covering the upstream gauged area and ungauged zone, and then calibrated the SWAT model using the data in the gauged area. To verify the results, we built two hydrodynamic scenarios (the original and adjusted scenarios) for Poyang Lake using the Delft3D model. In the original scenario, the upstream boundary condition is the observed stream flow from the upstream gauged area, while, in the adjusted scenario, it is the sum of the observed stream flow from the gauged area and the simulated stream flow from the ungauged zone. The experimental results showed that there is a stronger correlation and lower bias (R-2 = 0.81, PBIAS = 10.00 %) between the observed and simulated stream flow in the adjusted scenario compared to that (R-2 = 0.77, PBIAS = 20.10 %) in the original scenario, suggesting the simulated stream flow of the ungauged zone is reasonable. Using this method, we estimated the stream flow of the Poyang Lake ungauged zone as 16.4 +/- 6.2 billion m(3) a(-1), representing similar to 11.24% of the annual total water yield of the entire watershed. Of the annual water yield, 70% (11.48 billion m(3) a(-1)) is concentrated in the wet season, while 30% (4.92 billion m(3) a(-1)) comes from the dry season. The ungauged stream flow significantly improves the water balance with the closing error decreased by 13.48 billion m(3) a(-1) (10.10% of the total annual water resource) from 30.20 +/- 9.1 billion m(3) a(-1) (20.10% of the total annual water resource) to 16.72 +/- 8.53 billion m(3) a(-1) (10.00% of the total annual water resource). The method can be extended to other lake, river, or ocean basins where observation data is unavailable.

Beginning in 1989, Wisconsin implemented more restrictive harvest regulations for LMB, including greater minimum length limits, reduced bag limits, and a catch-and-release-only season during the spawning period across much of northern Wisconsin. We tested for trends in LMB relative abundance, growth, and angler catch and harvest in relation to LMB management policies from 1990 to 2011. We also tested for potential sport fish community responses to changes in LMB abundances using Walleye (WAE) Sander vitreus as an example. Angler catch rates and electrofishing catch per unit effort of LMB greater than 8 and 14 in increased significantly statewide. Mean length of age-6 LMB decreased significantly statewide. Release rates of LMB increased from about 80% in 1991 and then plateaued at more than 96% from 2005 to 2011. Concurrent with increases in LMB, adult WAR densities declined in lakes containing LMB. Ongoing research is being conducted to test for interactions between LMB and WAR and to test for additional environmental drivers, such as climate warming, that may be associated with increased LMB abundances. Largemouth Bass abundances have increased in Wisconsin, possibly in response to changes in harvest regulations, angler behavior, and potentially other environmental drivers. These increases in LMB abundances have had negative intraspecific effects on growth and may be negatively affecting WAE stocks. We recommend that management goals for LMB consider intra- and interspecific consequences, particularly in water bodies where multispecies fisheries are desired.

Reduction in areal extent of high-latitude wetlands in response to permafrost thaw	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Wetlands are vegetated regions that are inundated with water on a permanent, seasonal or intermittent basis(1). These ecosystems play an important role in the carbon cycle: wetlands take up and store carbon, and release carbon dioxide and methane through the decomposition of organic matter(2). More than 50% of wetlands are located in the high northern latitudes(3), where permafrost also prevails and exerts a strong control on wetland hydrology(4). Permafrost degradation is linked to changes in Arctic lakes: between 1973 and 2004 the abundance of lakes increased in continuous permafrost zones, but decreased in other zones(5). Here, we use a global climate model to examine the influence of permafrost thaw on the prevalence of high-latitude northern wetlands, under four emissions scenarios. We show that as permafrost degrades, the areal extent of wetlands declines; we found a net loss in wetland extent in the three highest emissions scenarios. We also note an initial increase in the number of days of the year conducive to wetland formation, owing to an increase in unfrozen surface moisture resulting from a lengthening of the thaw season. This is followed by a dramatic decline in the number of wetland-conducive days, owing to a deepening of the permafrost surface, and drainage of near-surface moisture to deeper soil layers. We suggest that a reduction in the areal extent and duration of wetlands will influence high-latitude carbon emissions.

MOB communities in lakes are diverse and vertically structured, but their spatio-temporal dynamics along the water column as well as physico-chemical parameters and interactions with other bacterial species that drive the community assembly have so far not been explored in depth. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the MOB and bacterial community composition and a large set of physico-chemical parameters in a shallow, seasonally stratified, and sub-alpine lake. Four highly resolved vertical profiles were sampled in three different years and during various stages of development of the stratified water column. Non-randomly assembled MOB communities were detected in all compartments. We could identify methane and oxygen gradients and physico-chemical parameters like pH, light, available copper and iron, and total dissolved nitrogen as important drivers of the MOB community structure. In addition, MOB were well-integrated into a bacterial-environmental network. Partial redundancy analysis of the relevance network of physico-chemical variables and bacteria explained up to 84% of the MOB abundances. Spatio-temporal MOB community changes were 51% congruent with shifts in the total bacterial community and 22% of variance in MOB abundances could be explained exclusively by the bacterial community composition. Our results show that microbial interactions may play an important role in structuring the MOB community along the depth gradient of stratified lakes.					; Wehrli, Bernhard/A-4406-2013; Wehrli, Bernhard/M-3847-2019; Burgmann, Helmut/E-8804-2011	Burgmann, Helmut/0000-0002-5651-5906; Wehrli, Bernhard/0000-0001-7029-1972; Mayr, Magdalena/0000-0002-3182-1480; Freimann, Remo/0000-0002-8955-2842; 														1664-302X				OCT 15	2020	11								579427	10.3389/fmicb.2020.579427	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.579427								33178162					WOS:000586882900001

This work proposes a post-processing method for addressing both bias correction and total uncertainty quantification for daily forecasts of water quality parameters derived from dynamical lake models. The post-processing is implemented based on a Bayesian Joint Probability (BJP) modeling approach. The BJP model uses a log-sinh transformation to normalize the raw forecasts and corresponding observations, and uses a bivariate Gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship. The posterior distribution of the transformation parameters is inferenced through Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling; it generates unbiased probabilistic forecasts that account for uncertainties from all sources. The BJP is used to post-processing raw daily forecasts of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations of Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest lake in China with lead times from 0 to 5 days. Results suggest that an average 93.1% forecast bias has been removed by BJP. The root mean square error in probability skill scores range from 5.8% for NH to 68.2% for TP, and the nonparametric bootstrapping test suggests that 67.7% forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites, water quality parameters and lead times. The probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies, and have appropriate spread and thus correctly quantify forecast uncertainty. The BJP post-processing method used in this study can be a useful operational tool that help to better realize the potential of water quality forecasts derived from dynamical models.

J	Zimmerman, SRH; Wahl, DB				Zimmerman, Susan R. H.; Wahl, David B.			Holocene paleoclimate change in the western US: The importance of chronology in discerning patterns and drivers	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment in lakes and meadows forms a powerful archive that can be used to reconstruct environmental change through time. Reconstructions of lake level, of chemical, biological, and hydrological conditions, and of surrounding vegetation provide detailed information about past climate conditions, both locally and regionally. Indeed, most of our current knowledge of centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability in the arid western United States, where information about past hydroclimate is particularly important, comes from such sediment-based reconstructions. The pressing need for robust, precise predictions of future conditions is a significant motivation for paleoclimate science, and current research questions frequently require Holocene reconstructions to be resolved at sub-centennial timescales. Increasingly, regional syntheses seek to identify synoptic-scale patterns similar to those defined from modern observations (seasonal, interannual, multi-decadal, etc.) or to compare with the output of climate model simulations. However, the age control on existing records, especially those more than about 20 years old, is often sufficient only for millennial-scale interpretation. Here we assess the age control for 84 published and unpublished records from lakes and meadows in the Great Basin, California, and desert southwest, and use Bayesian modeling to evaluate the 95% uncertainty ranges for the 42 best-dated records. In the Late Holocene, about half of the 42 records have <400-year mean uncertainty ranges; however, high-precision age control is especially critical for young records, used to develop an accurate understanding of a proxy's response to known climate variations. In the Middle Holocene, records vary from 400 to >800-year mean uncertainty and records of the Early Holocene have 600- to >1400-year mean uncertainty ranges. We find that the largest control on modeled uncertainties is dating density, with at least 2 dates/kyr being optimal and suggest obtaining "range-finder" dates at the onset of a study to better predict the total number of dates needed for an adequate age model. Such a density avoids a commonly observed phenomenon of significant peaks in uncertainty arising in gaps between age control points. Analysis of the uncertainties associated with proxy shifts reveal that more than half are >400 years. Although such large uncertainties currently prevent sub-centennial interpretations in most cases, increased dating density, strategic use of limited funds (including budgeting for a 2 date/kyr minimum at the proposal stage), construction of age-depth models with Bayesian methods, and critical evaluation of chronological uncertainty will shed light on past climate variability at finer timescales, enhancing our understanding of global and regional drivers of western U.S. climate.

In this study, As distribution and speciation in multiphase media (induding surface water, interstitial water, and sediment) in Lake Yamdrok Basin in Tibet in wet and dry seasons were investigated to allow the biogeochemical behavior of As in the cold arid plateau lake to be understood. The total As (TAs) (mainly containing arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III))) concentrations were generally higher in surface and interstitial water in the lake zones than in billowing rivers. Among the four lake zones, significantly higher As concentrations were found in Chen Co, Yamdrok Tso, and Kongmo Co than in Bajiu Co, and surface sediments from the former three lake zones contained relatively high concentrations of the labile As. Redox potential (Eh) in sediments and HCO3- concentration in surface water primarily controlled labile As mobilization through reductive dissolution of As-bearing iron (hydr)oxides and oxyanion competition for As adsorption sites, and therefore affected the As distributions in aqueous phases. As(III) concentrations in interstitial water accounted for 41% +/- 33% of TAs, and positively correlated with the arsenate-reducing microbe population in sediments. In contrast, As(V) was predominant in surface water (accounting for 95% +/- 8% of TAs), and even trace amounts of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was found in wet season. Notably, lower Eh values in dry season triggered a marked increase in the As concentrations in interstitial water, and this probably increased the risk of As contamination of surface water.

In this paper, the abundance and composition of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton at 13 sites of Dianchi lake during the wet and dry seasons were monitored, and the relationship between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in this plateau lake was studied. Phytoplankton community structure analysis was carried out by ocular method, and bacterioplankton was investigated by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. The relationship between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton was observed using redundancy analysis. The results showed that 87 species of phytoplankton belonging to 5 phyla and 29 genera were identified in Dianchi lake. Phytoplankton diversity and richness were higher in the wet season than those in the dry season. In the wet season, Cyanophyta was the dominant phylum whose density was 2.01 x 10(8)cells/L, accounting for more than 90% of the total algae, then followed by Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta, and Cryptophyta. The spatial distribution of phytoplankton in the wet season and dry seasons showed significant differences. In the dry season, the north-central part of Dianchi lake was dominated byLimnothrix redekeiandMicrocystis minutissimaof Cyanophyta, whilePseudanabaena moniliformisandCoelosphaerium nagelianumof Cyanophyta mainly was dominated in the south of Dianchi lake. In the wet season,Microcystis minutissimaof Cyanophyta was the dominant species all the area, whileLimnothrix redekeiof Cyanophyta was second dominant. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla among bacterioplankton. The community structure of bacterioplankton was influenced by Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta.Cyanophyta had a major influence onPseudomonas,Acinetobacterof Proteobacteria, andFlavobacteriumof Bacteroidetes. Bacillariophyta showed a strong correlation withGemmobacter,Stenotrophomonas, andAeromonasof Proteobacteria. Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta produced the most significant impact on predicted functional genes of bacterioplankton, and the predicted functional genes of the samples were different in different seasons. Cell densities of Cyanophyta were positively related to metabolism-predicted functional genes of bacterioplankton. Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta had an impact on most of the cellular processes and signaling predicted functional genes. Bacterioplankton-predicted functional gene information storage and processing were significantly affected by cell densities of Chlorophyta. Therefore, the analysis of the phytoplankton community and the bacterioplankton-predicted functional gene in Dianchi lake exerts a great significance in revealing the ecosystem function of plateau lakes and harmful algal bloom control.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2020	27	32					40592	40603		10.1007/s11356-020-10033-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10033-6		JUL 2020						32671704					WOS:000548823300006
J	Wu, GP; Liu, YB				Wu, Guiping; Liu, Yuanbo			Capturing variations in inundation with satellite remote sensing in a morphologically complex, large lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, with high morphological complexity from south to north. In recent years, the lake has experienced expansion and shrinkage processes over both short- and long-term scales, resulting in significant hydrological, ecological and economic problems. Exactly how and how rapidly the processes of spatial change have occurred in the lake during the expansion and shrinkage periods is unknown. Such knowledge is of great importance for policymakers as it may help with flood/drought prevention, land use planning and lake ecological conservation. In this study, we investigated the spatial-temporal distribution and changing processes of inundation in Poyang Lake based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-1B data from 2000 to 2011. A defined water variation rate (WVR) and inundation frequency (IF) indicator revealed the water surface submersion and exposure processes of lake expansion and shrinkage in different zones which were divided according to the lake's hydrological and topographic features. Regional differences and significant seasonality variability were found in the annual and monthly mean IF. The monthly mean IF increased slowly from north to south during January-August but decreased quickly from south to north during September-December. During the lake expansion period, the lake-type water body zone (Zone II) had the fastest expansion rate, with a mean monthly WVR value of 34.47% in February-March, and was followed by the channel-type water body zone (Zone I) in March-May (22.47%). However, during the lake shrinkage period, rapid shrinkage first appeared around the alluvial delta zones in August-October. The sequence of lake surface shrinkage from August to December is exactly opposite to that of lake expansion from February to July. These complex inundation characteristics and changing process were driven by the high temporal variability of the river flows, the morphological diversity of the benthic landforms and the patterns of water movement. These results provide a foundation for basic hydrological and ecological studies and are valuable for the conservation and management of water resources in Poyang Lake. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Roy, K; Vrba, J; Kajgrova, L; Mraz, J				Roy, Koushik; Vrba, Jaroslav; Kajgrova, Lenka; Mraz, Jan			The concept of balanced fish nutrition in temperate European fishponds to tackle eutrophication	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The present work aimed to understand nutrient enrichment and resultant eutrophication caused by carp farming in semi-intensively managed, temperate shallow-lake ecosystems like central European fishponds - combining animal nutrition and plankton ecology group model principles. In the traditional yet predominant pond farming in central Europe, carp stocks start the vegetative season on a ketogenic diet (high in natural food), have a balanced diet shortly in mid-season (cereals introduced as supplementary feed), and end on a starchy diet (high in cereals). Under beginning-season diets, the fish (carp) stock exhibit high but non-bioeconomic N and P retentions. With a surplus of 'digestible' N (protein, amino acids) relative to insufficient carbohydrate energy, much of the digested N is pumped back to the environment in algae-reactive forms (NH4-N). A surplus of digestible P per unit of digestible N also triggers renal clearance of digested P; pumped back to environment as PO43- . By the end-of-season, N, P retentions deteriorate significantly due to high metabolic N losses caused by missing digestible amino acids (lysine, isoleucine) and decreased P digestibility, respectively. Little digested P is unutilized and even discarded in tandem with poor N deposition. End-of-season feeding in fishponds is perhaps most polluting and triggers de-novo lipogenesis, instead of protein (biomass) accretion. However, the ratio of reactive losses (to suspended losses) of N, P, which could instantly trigger algal assimilation, is equally high (bad) at the beginning-and end-of-season. We show aggravated N, P loading by carp may occur both under high and low zooplankton-zoobenthos availability, contradictory to prevailing notions. Environmental nutrient loading by carps is most suppressed, including lowest reactive N, P losses, when diet is balanced. Carp farming in regional fishponds could benefit by adopting scientifically sound 'pond feeds' and managing carps' satiety to graze (or spare) zooplankton-zoobenthos for prolonging clear-water phase.					; Kajgrová, Lenka/KDM-9665-2024; Roy, Koushik/D-6015-2018; Mraz, Jan/F-7915-2015; Vrba, Jaroslav/M-3780-2013; ROY, KOUSHIK/D-6015-2018	Kajgrova, Lenka/0000-0002-2692-7811; Mraz, Jan/0000-0003-3545-1269; Vrba, Jaroslav/0000-0003-2145-9024; ROY, KOUSHIK/0000-0001-7205-9034													0959-6526	1879-1786				SEP 1	2022	364								132584	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132584													WOS:000821948800010

We measured diel, seasonal and inter-annual variations of CO2 concentrations and related environmental variables in open water and flooded vegetation and estimated their habitat area using remote sensing in a representative Amazon floodplain lake, Lake Janauaca. Variability in CO2 concentrations in open water resulted from changes in the extent of inundation and exchange with vegetated habitats. Depth-averaged values of CO2 in the open water of the lake, 157 +/- 91 mu M (mean +/- SD), were less than those in an embayment near aquatic vegetation, 285 +/- 116 mu M, and were variable over 24-h periods at both sites. Within floating herbaceous plant mats, the mean concentration was 275 +/- 77 mu M, while in flooded forests it was 217 +/- 78 mu M. The best statistical model that included CO2 in aquatic plant mats, water clarity, rate of change in water level and chlorophyll-a concentrations explained around 90% of the variability in CO2 concentration. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling demonstrated that diel differences in water temperature between plant mats and open water as well as basin-scale motions caused lateral exchanges of CO2 between vegetated habitats and open water. Our findings extend understanding of CO2 in tropical lakes and floodplains with measurements and models that emphasize the importance of flooded forests and aquatic herbaceous plants fringing floodplain lakes as sources of CO2 to open waters.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Kasper, Daniele/K-7141-2013; Zhou, Wencai/ABB-4141-2022; Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022	Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247													1432-9840	1435-0629				JUN	2022	25	4					911	930		10.1007/s10021-021-00692-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-021-00692-y		AUG 2021											WOS:000686446900004
J	Wu, SF; Wu, Z; Liang, ZY; Liu, Y; Wang, YL				Wu, Sifeng; Wu, Zhen; Liang, Zhongyao; Liu, Yong; Wang, Yilin			Denitrification and the controlling factors in Yunnan Plateau Lakes (China): Exploring the role of enhanced internal nitrogen cycling by algal blooms	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Denitrification plays an important role in nitrogen (N) removal in freshwater ecosystems. This internal process regulates the fluctuations of N concentration, especially for lakes with high nutrients concentrations and long residence time. Lakes in Yunnan plateau (southwestern China) provide typical cases, while studies in this region have been rare. Therefore, we studied denitrification of two lakes (Lake Dianchi in hypereutrophic state and Lake Erhai in mesotrophic) in this region. We used acetylene inhibition technique to quantify potential denitrification rate (PDR) of these lakes in April and August, 2015 and 2016. PDR of the sediments ranged 0-1.21 mu mol/(N.m(2).hr), and that of overlying water ranged 0-0.24 mu mol/(N.L.hr). Then, we used Least Angle Regression to determine the controlling factors for denitrification. Nutrients controlled PDR from two aspects: providing essential nitrogen sources; and affecting the richness and metabolism of denitrifying bacteria. In April, both aspects limited PDR; while only nitrogen sources limited PDR in August, due to depleted nitrate and enhanced denitrifying bacteria activity. Ammonia was most significant to denitrification, indicating that nitrate from nitrification transported to the bottom of well-mixed lake provide major N source by denitrification. The high PDR and low nitrate concentrate in August were evidence of an enhanced internal N cycling by algal blooms.

It allows us to obtain more accurate information on water quality by applying a series of multivariate statistical techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA)/factor analysis (FA), hierarchical cluster analysis (CA), and multiple regression analysis (MRA). On 19 physicochemical parameters dataset over 5years and from 6 different sites located in and around the lake. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate the statistically considerable spatial and seasonal differences. The results of ANOVA suggest that there exist a statistically significant temporal variation in the water quality of the dam for all parameters. On the other hand, only organic matter has a statistically significant spatial variation. In the multiple linear models, an association between organic and inorganic parameters was found; their origin comes from the mechanical erosion process of agricultural lands in the watershed. The PCA/FA identifies five dominant factors as responsible of the data structure, explaining more than 94.96% of the total variance in the water quality dataset. This suggests that the variations in water compounds' concentration are mainly related to the multiple anthropogenic activities, as well as natural processes. The results of cluster analysis demonstrate that the sampling stations were divided in two similar groups, which indicates spatial homogeneity. While seasonal grouping has showed that the source of pollution was related to the level of runoff in the seasons.					; Hamil, Somia/AAF-4538-2020; amin, chaffai/AHD-3067-2022	CHAFFAI, Amin/0000-0002-2132-6507; Somia, HAMIL/0000-0002-3466-9437; 													1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2018	11	23							754	10.1007/s12517-018-4102-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-018-4102-5													WOS:000452262700004

The tropical Andes has a high density of glacial lakes that are situated in the high-altitude paramo (3500-4500 m). Ecological information about such lakes is scant despite the fact that these lakes are an important source of water for drinking, irrigation and electricity generation and feed several major tributaries of the Amazon. In this study, we provide data on a survey of 31 lakes in Cajas National Park (Ecuador). Two of the lakes were monitored monthly during one year. In situ nutrient addition experiments were carried out in three of the lakes. 2. Seasonal monitoring in two lakes revealed a thermal stratification of the water column between October and June, with a small temperature difference between epi-and hypolimnion (2-3 degrees C). Oxygen depletion of the hypolimnion towards the end of the stratification period indicated that no complete mixing of the water column occurred during stratification. There was no evidence of depletion of nutrients in the epilimnion or accumulation in the hypolimnion during stratification. There were also no clear seasonal changes in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration nor in phytoplankton community composition in the two lakes. 3. Inputs of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the vegetated catchment resulted in high DOC concentrations (median 2.9 mg L-1) compared to temperate mountain lakes. Water transparency was relatively low, with a median extinction coefficient for photosynthetic active radiation of 0.50 m(-1) and for UV-B radiation of 10.13 m(-1). Although the thermocline was deep and water transparency was low, estimates of the critical depth for photosynthesis were deeper than the mean water depth in all lakes, suggesting that phytoplankton was not light limited. 4. The phytoplankton community was dominated by chlorophytes (e.g. Oocystis), diatoms (small Cyclotella spp.) or small colonial cyanobacteria (Aphanocapsa, Merismopedia). The zooplankton community was either dominated by large cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods, or by the calanoid copepod Boeckella occidentalis. 5. Total concentrations of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) were comparable to those in temperate mountain lakes (4-35 mu g P L-1 and 162-758 mu g N L-1) while Chl-a concentrations were in the lower range (<1 mu g L-1). A large part of the total nutrient pool consists of dissolved organic N and P that appeared to have a low bioavailability to phytoplankton. The median seston N: P ratio of 44, a positive correlation between Chl-a and total P concentration, as well as nutrient addition assays carried out in three lakes all pointed to P limitation of phytoplankton.

Hydrological, socio-economic and reservoir alterations of Er Roseires Dam in Sudan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Er Roseires Dam plays a key role in controlling the Blue Nile flow in Sudan. This study explores the influence of the dam on the hydrological regimes, which in turn have implications for the ecosystem. The Range of Variability Approach (RVA) - based on a set of 32 indicators - was applied over the period 1965 to 2014 to establish a safe range of river flow. Moreover, remotely-sensed data of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to analyse the spatio-temporal variation of the dam's reservoir area over the period 2000-2014. Significant influence on the dry-season hydrological indicators is expressed by high negative hydrological alteration of the range from -47% to -100%, but the dam contributes positively through flow regulation during the flood season. Impounding water procedure and fluctuation of water flow caused by the dam are found to induce significant alterations. Releasing less water during the dry season and more gradual impounding process, which are not expected to affect the power generation or irrigation practices, are recommended for better ecological restoration. The total surface area of the reservoir has changed post the implementation of the dam heightening project. Since 2012, the lake surface area has expanded by 250%. Relationships between the lake size and the head have been developed to help in the monitoring of the hydrological conditions and, accordingly, in managing the dam operation. A field survey showed that the dam plays a positive social role as the reservoir supports local activities, such as fishery, farming, and collection of wood and fruits. But increased humidity and health problems have also been noted. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) would have a direct effect on Er Roseires Dam and the river flow downstream. High level of coordination among the riparian countries is recommended for better river water management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We aim to provide a new approach of deriving in-situ degradation coefficients of different N forms, and highlight factors that determine the spatial-temporal variability of degradation coefficients. Our results are based on a two-year field survey in 34 channels around the Taihu Lake Basin, eastern China. The derived degradation coefficients of different N forms based our newly-developed experimental device are: degradation coefficients of TN, NH4+ and NO3-N range from 0.006-0.449 d(-1), 0.022-1.175 d(-1) and -0.096-2.402 d(-1), respectively. The degradation coefficients of N show strong dependence on N concentration and water temperature. The seasonal difference of water temperature and N concentration leads to spatial-temporal variability of degradation coefficients. The derived degradation coefficients of N are further verified through one-dimensional water quality model simulations. The degradation coefficient obtained in this study and the influencing factors of its spatial-temporal variability provide invaluable reference for studies in aquatic environment.

As instrumental measurements are typically short, lake sediment proxies of aquatic primary productivity (PP) are often used to extend the observational record of eutrophication back in time. Sedimentary pigments provide specific information on PP and major algal communities, but the records are often limited in the temporal resolution. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data, in contrast, provide very high seasonal (sub-varve-scale) resolution, but the pigment speciation is limited. Here, we explore a combined approach on varved sediments from the Ponte Tresa basin, southern Switzerland, taking the advantages of both methods (HSI and high performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) with the goal to reconstruct the recent eutrophication history at seasonal to interannual resolution. We propose a modified scheme for the calibration of HSI data (here: Relative Absorption Band Depth between 590 and 730nm RABD(590-730)) and HPLC-inferred pigment concentrations (here: green pigments' {chlorophyll a and pheophytin a}) and present a calibration model (R-2=0.82; RMSEP similar to 12%). The calibration range covers >98% of the spectral index values of all individual pixels (68 mu mx68 mu m) in the sediment core. This allows us to identify and quantify extreme pigment concentrations related to individual major algal blooms, to identify multiple algal blooms within one season, and to assess interannual variability of PP. Prior to the 1930s, green pigment' concentrations and fluxes (similar to 50 mu gg(-1);similar to 2 mu gcm(-2)a(-1), chlorophyll a and pheophytin a) and interannual variability was very low. From the 1930s to 1964, chlorophyll a and pheophytin a increased by a factor of similar to 4, and -carotene appeared in substantial amounts (similar to 0.4 mu gcm(-2)a(-1)). Interannual variability increased markedly and a first strong algal bloom with green pigment' concentrations as high as 700 mu gg(-1) is observed in 1958. Peak eutrophication (similar to 12 mu gcm(-2)a(-1) chlorophyll a and pheophytin a) and very high interannual variability with extreme algal blooms (green pigment' concentrations up to 1400 mu gg(-1)) is observed until ca. 1990, when eutrophication decreases slightly. Maximum PP values after 2009 are likely the result of internal nutrient cycling related to repeated deep mixing of the lake.					; Schneider, Tobias/LRV-0133-2024	Schneider, Tobias/0000-0002-1593-0273; Rimer, Denise/0000-0001-7782-1286													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2018	60	3					381	398		10.1007/s10933-018-0028-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-018-0028-x													WOS:000444486100002

In the present study, the spatiotemporal distribution and potential risks of OPPs were investigated in overlying water and surficial sediments from urban waterways of Guangzhou. For all studied sites, in general, four target OPPs (i.e., malathion, chlorpyrifos, terbufos, and diazinon) were present in the overlying water, with malathion and chlorpyrifos as major components. Higher concentrations of the four OPPs were found for the water and sediments collected in the dry season compared to the wet season, possibly because of the dilution effect of heavy rains. The results of Pearson's analyses and principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) suggested similar sources for target OPPs in the water and sediments across the Guangzhou urban waterways. Potential ecological risks of the OPPs to three representative taxons (algae, aquatic invertebrates, and fish) were evaluated via toxic units (TUs) and risk quotients (RQs), while risk assessment on human health was performed using hazard index (HI). Although TU results showed no acute risks to the aquatic organisms in the overlying water and surface sediments, RQ results of the mixture showed high risks to the aquatic invertebrate and fish in all water samples. Individual HI values and cumulative HI values were on the order of 10(-6)-10(-3) for children and adults, suggesting no potential risks to either children or adults through drinking and bathing.

Although SGLs are expected to spread inland during the 21st century due to atmospheric warming, less is known about their future spatial distribution and volume. We use GrIS surface elevation model and regional climate model outputs to show that at the end of the 21st century (2070-2099) approximately 9.8 +/- 3.9 km(3) (+113% compared to 1980-2009) and 12.6 +/- 5 km(3) (+174%) of meltwater could be stored in SGLs under moderate and high representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), respectively. The largest increase is expected in the northeastern sector of the GrIS (191% in RCP 4.5 and 320% in RCP 8.5), whereas in west Greenland, where the most SGLs are currently observed, the future increase will be relatively moderate (55% in RCP 4.5 and 68% in RCP 8.5).					; Selmes, Nick/N-3634-2013; Leeson, Amber/JFA-1001-2023	Leeson, Amber/0000-0001-8720-9808; Selmes, Nick/0000-0002-6557-1379; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813; Livingstone, Stephen/0000-0002-7240-5037; Igneczi, Adam/0000-0003-1529-8383; Sole, Andrew/0000-0001-5290-8967													0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 28	2016	43	18					9729	9738		10.1002/2016GL070338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL070338													WOS:000385392900046

Sediment samples were collected along the Taizihe River, the concentration and ecological risks of Zn, Cu, Pb, Cr, As, and Cd were detected and evaluated, and the pollution sources was analyzed through principal components analyses. The results indicated that As, Pb, and Cd were the main heavy metal contaminants in the sediment from Taizihe River, and all the monitored sites in the wet and dry season exceed PEC value. In addition to Zn, the average concentrations of the rest of the heavy metals in the dry season were higher than that in the wet season, and most of the heavy metals showed a certain accumulation tendency from upstream to downstream. The level order of potential ecological risk was Cd > As > Pb > Zn > Cu > Cr, and the risk in dry season was higher than that in wet season. Among them, As, Cd, and Pb had the highest single potential ecological risk coefficient (E-r(i)), which occupied the dominate position of total risk. The potential ecological risk of most heavy metals in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season. The sources of heavy metal pollution in the sediments of the Taizihe River in different periods were the same, mainly from industrial pollution, especially from the petrochemical, electroplating industries, and mining. The heavy metal pollution in the Taizihe River was located in the middle and lower reaches of the cities, and has a certain relationship with the factories in the lower reaches of nearby city. During the dry season, the contribution rate of industrial pollution sources to heavy metals was more significant.					qi, wang/JUV-2984-2023														1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2018	77	16							569	10.1007/s12665-018-7750-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7750-6													WOS:000441836900002

Temporal dynamics of uncultured viruses: a new dimension in viral diversity	ISME JOURNAL												Recent work has vastly expanded the known viral genomic sequence space, but the seasonal dynamics of viral populations at the genome level remain unexplored. Here we followed the viral community in a freshwater lake for 1 year using genome-resolved viral metagenomics, combined with detailed analyses of the viral community structure, associated bacterial populations and environmental variables. We reconstructed 8950 complete and partial viral genomes, the majority of which were not persistent in the lake throughout the year, but instead continuously succeeded each other. Temporal analysis of 732 viral genus-level clusters demonstrated that one-fifth were undetectable at specific periods of the year. Based on host predictions for a subset of reconstructed viral genomes, we for the first time reveal three distinct patterns of host-pathogen dynamics, where the viruses may peak before, during or after the peak in their host's abundance, providing new possibilities for modelling of their interactions. Time series metagenomics opens up a new dimension in viral profiling, which is essential to understand the full scale of viral diversity and evolution, and the ecological roles of these important factors in the global ecosystem.

Trophic Ecology of Arapaima sp in a ria lake-river-floodplain transition zone of the Amazon	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Neotropical floodplains are usually productive systems that are maintained by the nutrient, detritus and sediment inputs provided by the main river channel flood pulse. Ria lakes represent a special feature and habitat in the Amazonian floodplains, being characterised by a dendritic morphology and dependence on terrestrial inputs provided by an intricate stream network. Our objective was to evaluate the trophic ecology of the arapaima (Arapaima sp.). We combined stomach content analysis with measurements of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values from dorsal muscle to infer the ontogenetic changes in trophic level and isotopic niche width in floodplain and ria lakes. Arapaima diet was dominated by fish from low trophic positions. While most of the stomachs sampled in the study ria lake were full, empty stomachs predominated in samples taken in the floodplain lakes. These differences indicate that ria lakes may provide better feeding grounds for arapaima during the dry season, presumably because ria lakes are interconnected with a large stream network and the main river channel year round. Nitrogen stable isotope results further indicated an ontogenetic dietary shift in arapaima, with piscivory increasing as a function of length in both environments. Carbon stable isotope analysis indicated that energy sources used by arapaima varied by environment, with arapaima using a greater diversity of food sources in ria lakes than in floodplain lakes. Information about the main carbon sources is useful for fishery management because stakeholders may choose to conserve key vegetal groups to ensure the productivity and diversity of aquatic ecosystems.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Freitas, Carlos/I-5386-2012; Freitas, Carlos/F-1752-2014; Castello, Leandro/K-4389-2012	Freitas, Carlos/0000-0001-5406-0998; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2018	27	1					237	246		10.1111/eff.12341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12341													WOS:000417191100022

Detection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in near-shore habitats of southern Lake Michigan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been documented throughout the United States fresh-waters but research has focused largely on lotic systems. Because PPCPs are designed to have a physiological effect, it is likely that they may also influence aquatic organisms. Thus, PPCPs may negatively impact aquatic ecosystems. The objectives of this research were to quantify PPCP abundance in near-shore habitats of southern Lake Michigan and identify factors related to PPCP abundance. Stratified sampling was conducted seasonally at four southern Lake Michigan sites. All sites and depths had measurable PPCP concentrations, with mean individual compound concentrations of acetaminophen (536 ng/L), caffeine (31.0 ng/L), carbamazepine (2.23 ng/L), cotinine (4.03 ng/L), gemfibrozil (7.03 ng/L), ibuprofen (7.88 ng/L), lincomycin (4.28 ng/L), naproxen (6.32 ng/L), paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine; 462 ng/L), sulfadimethoxine (0.94 ng/L), sulfamerazine (0.92 ng/L), sulfamethazine (0.92 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (26.0 ng/L), sulfathiazole (0.92 ng/L), tridocarban (5.72 ng/L), trimethoprim (5.15 ng/L), and tylosin (3.75 ng/L). Concentrations of PPCPs varied significantly among sampling times and locations (river mouth vs offshore), with statistical interactions between the main effects of site and time as well as time and location. Concentrations of PPCPs did not differ with site or depth. Temperature, total carbon, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and ammonium concentrations were related to total pharmaceutical concentrations. These data indicate that PPCPs are ubiquitous and persistent in southern Lake Michigan, potentially posing harmful effects to aquatic organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the pollution sources and their respective contribution is the prerequisite for environmental planning, management and restoration. In this study, the influence of complex pollution sources on the water quality of the Dengsha River watershed in Dalian, China, was investigated. The export coefficient method was coupled with the QUAL2K water quality model to estimate the loads of ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and total phosphorus (TP) from different sources, and to explore their respective contributions. Results indicated that animal feedlot and crop production were major sources for NH4-N load, and crop production, soil erosion and animal feedlot are the largest three sources of TP load with an annual total contribution of 98.4%. The pollutant load exhibited an intra-annual variation mainly due to the seasonality of rainfall and anthropogenic agricultural activities. The overall waste assimilation capacity (WAC) is overloaded and suggestions for water pollution control and treatment regarding each pollution source were proposed. This study addressed a new application of QUAL2K model coupled with the export coefficient model for watershed managers towards a sustainable water environmental management, and can therefore be a reference example for other small and medium-sized rural watersheds.																				2071-1050				NOV	2019	11	21							6022	10.3390/su11216022	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11216022													WOS:000501205200151
J	Wu, ZP; Wu, WD; Lin, C; Zhou, SL; Xiong, JF				Wu, Zhipeng; Wu, Weidong; Lin, Chen; Zhou, Shenglu; Xiong, Junfeng			Deciphering the origins, composition and microbial fate of dissolved organic matter in agro-urban headwater streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Landscape urbanization and intensive agriculture dramatically alter stream ecosystems, but it is little known how urban and agriculture land use change the quantity, quality and ultimate fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in stream ecosystems via nonpoint source pathways. Size-exclusion chromatography with fluorescence excitation-emission matrices, as well as absorbance and lignin biomarkers were applied to investigate the characteristics and microbial fate of DOM in 15 first-order agricultural, urban and forest headwater streams in Taihu Lake Watershed, a subtropical region of SE China. Results showed that both urban and agricultural land cover increased the amount of dissolved organic matter (DOC) with a lower C/N ratio, and that the majority of DOC was bound to terrestrial humic-like substances. Compared to forest-impacted headwater streams, the aromaticity and molecularity of OM were greatly decreased as the amounts of anthropogenic/aquagenic fulvic acid-like and protein-like DOM enriched in urban streams, and that of microbially soil-derived humic-like DOM and low molecular-weight substances (e.g., neutrals and acids) increased in agricultural streams, respectively. Human-influenced land use also influenced the seasonal variability of stream DOM biogeochemistry. Natural watersheds produced high DOC specific loads and concentrations only in the rainy season (high-flow period). Agricultural streams contributed a higher amount of terrestrial humic-like and protein-like fractions and urbanized watersheds had high values of autochthonous protein-like fractions only. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that DOM quality (explainable variables: molecular source, 43.29%; molecular-weight, 29.74%) were the most prominent factor impacting microbial carbon processing, followed by inorganic nutrients (17.29%). A higher proportion of DOM from urban streams was eventually mineralized to carbon dioxide mainly due to the inefficient utilization of humic and nonhumic (e.g., protein, polysaccharides and lignin) substances as well as higher levels of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, whereas a significant fraction of DOM from agricultural and forest streams tended to enter microbial production and the recalcitrant-DOM pool due to the presence of less labile substrates. Our findings indicate that differences in stream-DOM and environmental properties due to urbanization and farming practices may influence stream microbial carbon processing and cause bottom-up changes in the fate of organic carbon moving through freshwater ecosystems.

In Caohai Lake, an important karst wetland in southwestern China, karst surface water and groundwater are important recharge water sources, and nitrates flow into the wetland along with the surface water and groundwater, degrading the wetland water quality. Therefore, identifying the sources of nitrate in the surface water and groundwater in the Caohai catchment is of great significance to the protection of the wetland water environment. In this study, the nitrate concentrations, hydrochemistry and multiple stable isotope ratios (delta O-18-H2O, delta D-H2O, delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-) were used to identify the sources and fate of the NO3- in the groundwater and inflowing rivers around the Caohai wetland. The results showed that the NO3- concentrations in the groundwater samples from the southern side exceeded the WHO limit during the wet season, while other samples did not exceed the limit. The mean concentrations of NO3- in groundwater were higher than those in the inflowing river water, and NO3- concentrations decreased in the order of wet season>dry season>normal season in the groundwater and inflowing rivers. The hydrochemistry and multiple isotope ratios suggest that the nitrate transformation was dominated by nitrification processes, while denitrification had an influence on the transformation of NO3- (as evidenced by isotopes) in groundwater during the dry season. According to the analyses based on a stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR), sewage and manure were the main sources of NO3- in the groundwater, while sewage, manure and chemical fertilizer were the major sources of NO3- in the inflowing river water; therefore, the scientific use of farmland fertilizers and the treatment of domestic sewage should be strengthened to safeguard groundwater quality and control the NO3- concentrations in rivers.

Areas downstream of bloom locations provide critical habitat for an estuarine population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Since 2010, approximately 30 of these dolphins have stranded and died within this impaired watershed; the cause of death was inconclusive for a majority of these individuals. For the current study, environmental exposure to MCs/NODs was investigated as a potential cause of dolphin mortality. Stranded dolphins from 2013 to 2017 were categorized into estuarine (n = 17) and coastal (n = 10) populations. Because estuarine dolphins inhabit areas with frequent or recurring cyanoblooms, they were considered as a comparatively high-risk group for cyanotoxin exposure in relation to coastal animals. All available liver samples from estuarine dolphins were tested regardless of stranding date, and samples from coastal individuals that stranded outside of the known cyanotoxin bloom season were assessed as controls. The MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutiric acid) technique was used to determine total (bound and free) concentrations of MCs/NODS in liver tissues. Free MCs/NODs extractions were conducted and analyzed using ELISA and LC-MS/MS on MMPB-positive samples to compare test results. MMPB testing resulted in low-level total MCs/NODs detection in some specimens. The Adda ELISA produced high test values that were not supported by concurrent LC-MS/MS analyses, indicative of false positives.

The influence of inundation and lake morphometry on the dynamics of mercury in the water and plankton in an Amazon floodplain lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal flooding changes chemical and morphometric characteristics of the tropical floodplain lakes, affecting stratification which can influence mercury dynamics. We investigate the influence of flooding on the mercury dynamics in an Amazon floodplain lake. Three points on the lake, the Solimes River, and the connecting channel to the river were sampled along the annual flood pulse. During high-water, the lake was deep (12.7 m, on average) and the area farthest from the river was stratified with low oxygen and high methylmercury concentrations ([MeHg]) at depths below 7 m (0.37 ng l(-1), on average). The two sites closest to the river were destratified and the [MeHg] was lower (0.077 ng l(-1), on average along all depths). At low-water, the lake was shallower (3 m, on average) and destratified, with higher oxygen concentrations, and no difference in [MeHg] along the water column at all lake sites. Independent of season, the [MeHg] in the connecting channel was higher than those in the river. The [MeHg] in phytoplankton varied in response to changes in biomass, showing a biodilution effect. Variations in lake morphometry controlled the stratification and [MeHg] in the lake during the high-water. Floodplain lakes export hypolimnetic MeHg to their associated rivers during high-water.

At the spatial scale, the responses of soil bacterial diversity and composition to hydrological variations in wetlands have been extensively investigated. However, at the temporal scale, especially at the inter-annual scale, the corresponding bacterial responses are rarely reported. Therefore, we explored the effects of flooding variations on the diversity and composition of soil bacterial communities at a lakeshorewetland in two hydrological contrasting years. Three flooding variables, i.e. flooding duration (FD), total duration of the growing season (TGD), and exposure duration of the growing season (EGD), were used to characterize flooding regime. Soil bacterial communities were determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencingmethod. We found a very high soil bacterial diversity at the lakeshore wetland. The Shannon's indexes of soil bacterial communities varied from 5.61 to 7.11 in two years. Soil bacterial a-diversity followed a unimodal curve along the elevation gradient, andwas significantly lower in the flooding year than in the drought year. Principal coordinate analysis demonstrated that the compositions of soil bacterial communities were separated in order of elevation and year along the first and second axes, respectively. The apparent habitat preferences of soil bacterial families were closely connected with their respiratory traits, and this trendwas stronger at the inter-annual scale than at the spatial scale. Soil bacterial compositions were predominantly determined by the direct (by changing respiratory traits) and indirect (by changing soil pH) effects of TGD at the spatial scale, while they were simultaneously regulated by the direct effects of three flooding variables at the inter-annual scale. Our results enhance the understanding of soilmicrobial communities inwetlands and have large implications for developing general theories to predicting soilmicrobial functions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

'Dust in the wind' from source-to-sink: Analysis of the 14-15 April 2015 storm in Utah	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												On 14-15 April 2015, an intense intermountain cyclone in the western USA caused high winds and a dust storm that degraded air quality in the eastern Great Basin, and deposited dust-on-snow (DOS) in the Wasatch Range near Salt Lake City, Utah. We analyzed the storm and documented its "source-to-sink" development to relate the frontal passage with dust mobilization, air quality changes, and dust deposition on montane snowpack near Alta, Utah. This case study is first to track a dust storm and measure the elemental composition and radiative properties of the resulting DOS as a single specific event layer in Wasatch montane snowpack; prior studies have assessed seasonally aggregated DOS deposits. Dust plumes on MODIS imagery indicate mobilization from known regional "hotspots" for aeolian activity, including clay- and silt-rich alluvium, modern playas, and disturbed areas within the Pleistocene Paleolake Bonneville Basin. This 2015 single event dust layer was 1-3 cm thick with a median dust size of 10.81-12.55 mu m; its measured radiative properties are similar to aggregated dusts previously assessed in Wasatch snowpack. Dust from the 2015 DOS event is enriched in the elements As, Cd, Cu, and Mo by a 10 x factor relative to average elemental concentrations in the upper continental crust; its heavy metals (Cu, Pb, As, Cd, Mo, Zn) are probably derived from regional mine operations. Tracking elemental fluxes from source-to-sink is important for resolving environmental impacts, and informing future analysis of single storm dust loading, ecosystem impacts, and quantity and quality of meltwater-fed drinking water.																			1875-9637	2212-1684				OCT	2020	46								100532	10.1016/j.aeolia.2019.06.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2019.06.002													WOS:000564564400006

Gene expression pattern of microbes associated with large cyanobacterial colonies for a whole year in Lake Taihu	WATER RESEARCH												Large cyanobacterial colonies, which are unique niches for heterotrophic bacteria, are vital for blooming in eutrophic waters. However, the seasonal dynamics of molecular insights into microbes in these colonies remain unclear. Here, the community composition and metabolism pattern of microbes inhabiting large cyanobacterial colonies (> 120 mu m, collected from Lake Taihu in China) were investigated monthly. The community structure of total microbes was mostly influenced by chlorophyll a (Chl a), total phosphorus (TP) concentration, dissolved oxygen, and temperature, whereas the colony-associated bacteria (excluding Cyanobacteria) were mostly influenced by total organic carbon, NO3-, and PO(4)(3- )concentrations, indicating different response patterns of Cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria to water nutrient conditions. Metatranscriptomic data suggested that similar to that of Cyanobacteria, the gene expression patterns of the most active bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, were not strictly dependent on season but separated by Chl a concentrations. Samples in July and September (high-bloom period) and February and March (non-bloom period) formed two distinct clusters, whereas those of other months (low-bloom period) clustered together. The accumulation of transcripts for pathways, such as phycobilisome from Cyanobacteria and bacterial chemotaxis and flagellum, phosphate metabolism, and sulfur oxidation from Proteobacteria, was enriched in high-and low-bloom periods than in non-bloom period. Network analyses revealed that Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria exhibited coordinated transcriptional patterns in almost all divided modules. Modules had Cyanobacteria-dominated hub gene were positively correlated with temperature, Chl a, total dissolved phosphorus, and NH4+ and NO2- concentrations, whereas modules had Proteobacteria-dominated hub gene were positively correlated with TP and PO43- . These results indicated labor division might exist in the colonies. This study provided metabolic insights into microbes in large cyanobacterial colonies and would support the understanding and management of the year-round cyanobacterial blooms.

Analyses of data revealed significant seasonal variations (p <= 0.05) of ten water variables (temperature, transparency, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, total hardness, total alkalinity, PO4 - P, and SiO4 - Si) in both the wetlands; however, no significant variation was observed among the sampling stations. In total, 128 species of phytoplankton were recorded (118 species belonging to 94 genera in seasonally open; 103 species belonging to 86 genera in closed wetland). Four algal groups, viz. Cyanophyceae, Coscinodiscophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Chlorophyceae, were the dominant quantitative component, remarkably influencing the total phytoplankton population in both the wetlands, contributing similar to 87% of total phytoplankton. Species Aulacoseira granulata alone contributed 12 - 41% and 8 - 34% to the total phytoplankton in the seasonally open and closed wetland, respectively, and indicated high organic load in both the wetlands. Altogether thirty-six and thirty-one phytoplankton taxa appeared as major indicators across the seasons for seasonally open and closed wetland, respectively. The indicator taxa (Aulacoseira, Oscillatoria, Dolichospermum, Spirogyra, Synedra, Nitzschia, Navicula, Euglena, Phacus) in both the wetlands hinted that the wetlands are under pollution pressure. The assemblage structure of phytoplankton was related to transparency, NO3 - N, PO4 - P, SiO4 - Si, total dissolved solids, and temperature as evident from BIO - ENV. Furthermore, the marginal test also selected similar variables (depth, transparency, conductivity, PO4 - P, SiO4 - Si) for seasonally open and the variables such as depth, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total alkalinity, and NO3 - N for the closed wetland. The study showed that the seasonal riverine connectivity greatly influences the variations in phytoplankton community in the seasonally open wetland.

Evaluation of Spatio-temporal Changes in Surface Water Quality and Their Suitability for Designated Uses, Mettur Reservoir, India	NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH												Freshwater has a significant role in determining the ecological environment, public health and socio-economic development. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal variation in surface water quality of the tropical reservoir Mettur, India, to determine whether its water is suitable for human consumption and aquatic ecosystem. Thus, 21 water quality parameters were monitored seasonally (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon) at nine sampling sites covering riverine, transitional and lacustrine zones of the reservoir during 2018. The study revealed spatial variation, which was due to input from industrial and domestic wastewater in the lacustrine zone of the reservoir. However, temporal variability often exceeded spatial variability. The factor analysis indicates that basin geology, anthropogenic stress and agricultural applications simultaneously act vital roles in deciding the reservoir water quality. Based on similarity of water quality parameters, cluster analysis grouped all the nine sampling sites into three clusters of high, moderate and less polluted sites. Correlation analysis also indicated that multiple sources influence the reservoir water quality during all the seasons. Based on BIS and WHO values, the calculated water quality index (134-158) indicates that water of the reservoir is not fit for human consumption, while the trophic state of this reservoir is moderately-eutrophic to eutrophic. However, with precaution, this aquatic body seems to be suitable for aquatic life and fish growth. The overall water quality deterioration of this reservoir indicates a strong need for development of a regular monitoring system for implementation of an effective management system to safeguard human and environmental health.

The Trasimeno is the largest Italian peninsular lake located inUmbria (Central Italy), in a rural area with lowanthropogenic impact. All the sampleswere analyzed by an inhouse developed analytical procedure involving a single sample preparation with dual detection: Gas- and Liquid-Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS for PBDEs and LC-MS/MS for HBCDs). BFRs levels in crucian carp, tench and European perch were negligible and mostly below quantification limits (LOQs). In eel, the species with the higher fat content, PBDE sum (15 congeners) ranged from 0.269 to 0.916 ng/g w.w. BDE-47, -100 and -154 accounted for roughly 57%, 16% and 11% of the PBDE sum, respectively, while BDE-99 (usually one of the most abundant congeners in biota), only for 3%. HBCDs (sum of alpha-, beta-,gamma-isomers) were found between 0.157 and 1.14 ng/g w.w. with alpha- as predominant isomer (92% of the sum), followed by gamma- (5%) and beta- (2%). Peculiar was the contamination in red swamp crayfish characterized by negligible PBDEs and very high HBCDs levelswith a singular contamination pattern. In female pools (n= 9) themean HBCDs sumwas 0.150 ng/g w.w., while inmales higher concentrationsweremeasured (mean= 2.77 ng/gw.w.). Asignificant correlation seems to exist between the contamination level and the seasonal cycle only inmale crayfish. Interestingly, among the HBCDs, the.-isomer was the highest (67% of the total) while alpha- contributes only for 20%. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Environmental and behavioral controls on juvenile Chinook salmon migration pathways in the Columbia River estuary	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Juvenile Chinook salmon population dynamics in the Columbia River estuary are influenced by physical processes, hatchery practices, and behavioral decision-making. To better understand how environmental forcing and swimming behavior influence estuarine migration and travel times, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) that uses 3-D outputs from a hydrodynamic model to simulate Lagrangian transport as well as swimming and bioenergetics sub-models to simulate active swimming and growth. Simulations were run in 2010 during the migration seasons for yearling and subyearling Chinook salmon. For both life history types, alternative behaviors were simulated, from random walks to behaviors that optimized efficient system migration for yearling Chinook salmon and growth for subyearling Chinook salmon. Simulation results compared well against observed data on travel times and common migration pathways; the simulated travel times for both yearling and subyearling Chinook salmon were within several hours of the observed travel times. In general, residence times and pathways were largely driven by river discharge and the phase of the tide. During periods of greater river discharge, simulated estuarine residence times were reduced and variability across individuals was minimal. The timing of estuarine exit was closely tied to the phase of the tide, with most simulated individuals exiting the system during the ebb phase. While travel times were largely driven by flow velocities, swimming behavior was likewise important. Simulated yearling Chinook salmon behaviors that optimized movement with surrounding flows resulted in reduced estuarine residence times when compared to passive and random walk behaviors. Similarly, simulated subyearling Chinook salmon behaviors that optimized growth directed individuals to shallow peripheral habitats, resulting in longer residence times and higher growth rates. Even if potentially important factors such as predator avoidance were not included, this IBM provides an informative tool to model migration pathways, growth, and residence times of juvenile salmon in an estuarine environment and could be used to inform management decisions by evaluating various scenarios.

Lake Cajititlan is a shallow, subtropical, and endorheic lake in western Mexico. Nutrient pollution from agricultural activity and wastewater discharge have affected the lake's water quality, leading the reservoir to a hypereutrophic state, resulting in episodes of fish mortality during the rainy season. This study investigated the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities within Lake Cajititlan and their genes associated with the nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and carbon biogeochemical cycles during the rainy season, as well as the influences of physicochemical and environmental variables on such dynamics. Significant temporal variations were observed in the composition of bacterial communities, of which Flavobacterium and Pseudomonas were the dominant genera. The climatological parameters that were most correlated with the bacterial communities and their functional profiles were pH, DO, ORP, turbidity, TN, EC, NH4+, and NO3-. The bacterial communities displayed variations in their functional composition for nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur metabolisms during the sampling months. The bacterial communities within the lake are highly susceptible to nutrient loads and low DO levels during the rainy season. Bacterial communities had a higher relative abundance of genes associated with denitrification, nitrogen fixation, assimilatory sulfate reduction, cysteine, SOX system, and all phosphorus metabolic pathways. The results obtained here enrich our understanding of the bidirectional interactions between bacterial communities and major biogeochemical processes in eutrophic subtropical lakes.

Global development and human activity have led to an increase in aridity, resulting in ecosystem degradation and desertification around the world. The objective of the present work was to investigate and compare the microbial community structure and geochemical characteristics of two geographically distinct saline pan sediments in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa. Our data suggest that these microbial communities have been shaped by geochemical drivers, including water content, salinity, and the supply of organic matter. Using Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing, this study provides new insights into the diversity of bacteria and archaea in semi-arid, saline, and low-carbon environments. Many of the observed taxa are halophilic and adapted to water-limiting conditions. The analysis reveals a high relative abundance of halophilic archaea (primarily Halobacteria), and the bacterial diversity is marked by an abundance of Gemmatimonadetes and spore-forming Firmicutes. In the deeper, anoxic layers, candidate division MSBL1, and acetogenic bacteria (Acetothermia) are abundant. Together, the taxonomic information and geochemical data suggest that acetogenesis could be a prevalent form of metabolism in the deep layers of a saline pan.					; Wagner, Dirk/C-3932-2012	Genderjahn, Steffi/0000-0002-8912-184X; Wagner, Dirk/0000-0001-5064-497X; Horn, Fabian/0000-0002-4070-3400														1664-302X				SEP 20	2018	9								2082	10.3389/fmicb.2018.02082	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02082								30294305					WOS:000445091100001

To address these issues, projects have been implemented to form integrated urban water bodies via interconnecting artificial lake or ponds with rivers, but causing pollution accumulation downstream and eutrophication. Despite it is crucial to assess eutrophication, research on this topic in urban interconnected water bodies is limited, particularly regarding variability and feasible strategies for remediation. This study focused on the Loucun river in Shenzhen, comprising an pond, river and artificial lake, evaluating water quality changes pre-(post-)ecological remediation and establishing a new method for evaluating the water quality index (WQI). The underwater forest project, involving basement improvement, vegetation restoration, and aquatic augmentation, in the artificial lake significantly reduced total nitrogen (by 43.58%), total phosphorus (by 79.17%) and algae density (by 36.90%) compared to pre-remediation, effectively controlling algal bloom. Rainfall, acting as a variable factor, exacerbated downstream nutrient accumulation, increasing total phosphorus by 4.56 times and ammonia nitrogen by 1.30 times compared to the dry season, and leading to algal blooms in the non-restoration pond. The improved WQI method effectively assesses water quality status. The interconnected water body exhibits obvious nutrient accumulation in downstream regions. A combined strategy that reducing nutrient and augmenting flux was verified to alleviate accumulation of nutrients downstream.

The algorithm was based on atmospherically corrected surface reflectance at 645 nm, with 1240 nm data serving as a reference for aerosols and a nearest-neighbor method was used to avoid land adjacency effect. The algorithm showed an uncertainty of 30-40% for TSS ranging between 3 and 200 mg L-1. Long-term TSS distribution maps derived from MODIS data and the customized TSS algorithm showed significant variations in both space and time, with low TSS (<10 mg L-1) in wet seasons and much higher TSS (>15-20 mg L-1) in dry seasons for the south lake, and generally higher TSS in the north lake. The TSS difference between the north and the south increased significantly after 2002, with mean TSS often reaching >40 mg L-1 in the north. While the TSS seasonality was attributed to the seasonal changes of the lake's circulation, the inter-annual variations were primarily driven by sand dredging activities, regulated by management policies. The case study here provides baseline water quality information for future restoration efforts in Poyang Lake, and more generally, an approach to assess water quality changes in similar water bodies, which have resulted from either climate variability or human activities.

This study used 48-hr microcosm incubations of profundal sediment and bottom water from a sulfate-rich, hypereutrophic reservoir to assess seasonal patterns of MeHg cycling under various treatments. Treatments included addition of air, Hg(II), organic carbon, and microbial inhibitors. Both aeration and sodium molybdate, a sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) inhibitor, generally decreased MeHg concentration in microcosm water, likely by inhibiting SRB activity. The methanogenic inhibitor bromoethanesulfonate increased MeHg concentration 2- to 4- fold, suggesting that methanogens were potent demethylators. Pyruvate increased MeHg concentration under moderately reduced conditions, likely by stimulating SRB, but decreased it under highly reduced conditions, likely by stimulating methanogens. Acetate increased MeHg concentration, likely due to the stimulation of acetotrophic SRB. Results suggest that iron-reducing bacteria (IRB) were not especially prominent methylators and MeHg production at the sediment-water interface is elevated under moderately reduced conditions corresponding with SRB activity. In contrast, it is suppressed under oxic conditions due to low SRB activity, and under highly reduced conditions (<-100 mV) due to enhanced demethylation by methanogens. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Present state of the Aral Sea: diverging physical and biological characteristics of the residual basins	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Latest data on the hydrophysical and biological state of the residual basins of the Aral Sea are presented and compared. Direct, quasi-simultaneous observations were carried out in the central part of the Western Large Aral Sea, the northern extremity of the Large Aral known as Chernyshev Bay, Lake Tshchebas, and the Small Aral Sea in October 2014. The Large Aral Sea and Lake Tshchebas transformed into hyperhaline water bodies with highly special taxocene structure. The Small Aral Sea was a relatively diverse brackish ecosystem, which was rather similar to the pre-desiccation environment. The Small Aral Sea and Lake Tshchebas exhibited a fully-mixed vertical structure, whereas the Western Large Aral Sea was strongly stratified. Our data show that during desiccation, different parts of the Aral Sea experienced different environmental conditions, resulting in qualitative and quantitative differences in the physical and biological regimes among the different residual basins.

J	Kim, J; Ivanov, VY; Fatichi, S				Kim, Jongho; Ivanov, Valeriy Y.; Fatichi, Simone			Climate change and uncertainty assessment over a hydroclimatic transect of Michigan	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Predictions of a warmer climate over the Great Lakes region due to global change generally agree on the magnitude of temperature changes, but precipitation projections exhibit dependence on which General Circulation Models and emission scenarios are chosen. To minimize model- and scenario-specific biases, we combined information provided by the 3rd phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project database. Specifically, the results of 12 GCMs for three emission scenarios B1, A1B, and A2 were analyzed for mid- (2046-2065) and end-century (2081-2100) intervals, for six locations of a hydroclimatic transect of Michigan. As a result of Bayesian Weighted Averaging, total annual precipitation averaged over all locations and the three emission scenarios increases by 7 % (mid-)-10 % (end-century), as compared to the control period (1961-1990). The projected changes across seasons are non-uniform and precipitation decreases by 3 % (mid-)-5 % (end-) for the months of August and September are likely. Further, average temperature is very likely to increase by 2.02-2.85 A degrees C by the mid-century and 2.58-4.73 A degrees C by the end-century. Three types of non-additive uncertainty sources due to climate models, anthropogenic forcings, and climate internal variability are addressed. When compared to the emission uncertainty, the relative magnitudes of the uncertainty types for climate model ensemble and internal variability are 149 and 225 % for mean monthly precipitation, and they are respectively 127 and 123 % for mean monthly temperature. A decreasing trend of the frost days and an increasing trend of the growing season length are identified. Also, a significant increase in the magnitude and frequency of heavy rainfall events is projected, with relatively more pronounced changes for heavy hourly rainfall as compared to daily events. Quantifying the inherent natural uncertainty and projecting hourly-based extremes, the study results deliver useful information for water resource stakeholders interested in impacts of climate change on hydro-morphological processes.					; Ivanov, Valeriy/B-4510-2013	Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659; Ivanov, Valeriy/0000-0002-5208-2189													1436-3240	1436-3259				MAR	2016	30	3					923	944		10.1007/s00477-015-1097-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-015-1097-2													WOS:000371316900011

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is the world's largest permafrost region in the middle and low latitudes. Permafrost status monitoring in the QTP is of great significance to global change and local economic development. In this study, we used 66 scenes of ALOS data (2007-2009), 73 scenes of ALOS-2 data (2015-2020) and 284 scenes of Sentinel-1 data (2017-2021) to evaluate the spatial and temporal permafrost deformation over the 83,000 km(2) in the northern QTP, passing through the Tuotuohe, Beiluhe, Wudaoliang and Xidatan regions. We use the SBAS-InSAR method and present a coherence weighted least squares estimator without any hypothetical model to calculate long-term deformation velocity (LTDV) and maximum seasonal deformation (MSD) without any prior knowledge. Analysis of the ALOS results shows that the LTDV ranged from -20 to +20 mm/year during 2007-2009. For the ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 results, the LTDV ranged from -30 to 30 mm/year during 2015-2021. Further study shows that the expansion areas of permafrost subsidence are concentrated on braided stream plains and thermokarst lakes. In these areas, due to glacial erosion, surface runoff and river alluvium, the contents of water and ground ice are sufficient, which could accelerate permafrost subsidence. In addition, by analyzing LTDV and MSD for the different periods, we found that the L-band ALOS-2 is more sensitive to the thermal collapse of permafrost than the C-band sensor and the detected collapse areas (LTDV < -10 mm/year) are consistent with the GF-1/2 thermal collapse dataset. This research indicates that the InSAR technique could be crucial for monitoring the evolution of permafrost and freeze-thaw disasters.					; Wang, Chao/GSN-3524-2022; Tang, Yx/HMV-9782-2023	Tang, Yixian/0000-0002-9847-898X; Zou, Lichuan/0009-0008-4379-306X; Dong, LongKai/0000-0002-0123-6993; Wang, Chao/0000-0003-4887-923X; zhang, hong/0000-0002-0088-8148														2072-4292				APR	2022	14	8							1870	10.3390/rs14081870	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14081870													WOS:000787408100001

The dynamics of metals in six fish species (Hoplias malabaricus, Oligosarcus jenynsii, Rhamdia quelen, Bryconamericus iheringii, Astyanax fasciatus and Odontesthes bonariensis) from the reservoir were investigated to discover the possible differential influence of habitat and diet on metal accumulation in the fish. In the abiotic matrix, the highest heavy metal concentrations were observed in sediment. The concentrations of Al, Cu and Pb in water exceeded the limits considered as hazardous for aquatic life. Potential ecological risk analysis of metal concentrations in sediment indicated a low ecological risk in Rio Tercero Reservoir in all sampling periods. The enrichment factor indicated that Cu, Pb, Zn and Hg come from anthropogenic sources. Among five different organs, the highest metal levels were found in gills and intestine. Rhamdia quelen and Oligosarcus jenynsii were the species with the highest values of metal accumulation in the whole body. Our study showed that the accumulation pattern of these multi-elements in the different fish species did not respond to diet or habitat, but seemed to be related to the detoxification mechanisms and the metabolism of each organism.

Two year average annual FCH4 (49.7 g C-CH4 m-2yr-1) from the marsh was high and compatible with its net annual CO2 uptake (FCO2: -21.0 g C-CO2 m-2yr-1). In contrast, FCH4 was small (2.3 g C-CH4 m-2yr-1) and accounted for a minor portion of the atmospheric carbon budget (FCO2: -151.8 g C-CO2 m-2yr-1) at the cropland. At the seasonal scale, soil temperature associated with methane (CH4) production provided the dominant regulator of FCH4 at the marsh (R2=0.86). At the diurnal scale, plant-modulated gas flow was the major pathway for CH4 outgassing in the growing season at the marsh. Diffusion and ebullition became the major pathways in the nongrowing season and were regulated by friction velocity. Our findings highlight the importance of freshwater marshes for their efficiency in turning over and releasing newly fixed carbon as CH4. Despite marshes accounting for only similar to 4% of area in the agriculture-dominated landscape, their high FCH4 should be carefully addressed in the regional carbon budget.

Understanding the dispersal mechanisms of aquatic invaders is very important for protection and management of vulnerable water bodies. Here we ask how recreational boats that are transported overland could contribute to the dispersal of invasive zebra mussels among lakes in Switzerland. Using a questionnaire sent to registered boat owners, we surveyed properties of transported boats and collected information on self-reported mussel fouling and transport activities of boat owners. We also sampled boat hulls at launching ramps and harbors for biofouling invertebrates. Boats that were kept seasonally or year-round in water were found to have high vector potential with mussel fouling rates of more than 40 %. However, only about 6 % of boats belonging to these groups were transported overland to other water bodies. Considering that approximately 100,000 recreational boats are registered in Switzerland, we estimated that every year around 1400 boats fouled with mussels are transported overland. Such boats pose a high risk of distributing zebra mussels between water bodies. Our results suggest that there is a considerable risk that recreational boats may spread new fouling species to all navigable water bodies within the study area. We speculate that one such species could be the quagga mussel, which has not yet invaded lakes in Switzerland. On a more positive note, our study has identified the group of high-risk boats so that possible control measures would only affect a relatively small number of boat owners.					; Kopp, Kirstin/G-3513-2010; Tobias, Robert/AAQ-3002-2021	Jokela, Jukka/0000-0002-1731-727X; Tobias, Robert/0000-0001-7972-122X; Kopp, Kirstin/0000-0001-5485-5379													1387-3547	1573-1464				MAY	2016	18	5					1451	1466		10.1007/s10530-016-1094-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1094-5													WOS:000374411200018

Several factors, such as the urea nitrogen application amount, days after fertilization, NH4 (+)-N concentration and pH of surface water, and climate, that could affect ammonia volatilization were also studied. The results indicated that ammonia volatilization loss increased linearly with increasing amounts of applied urea. The ratios of the ammonia volatilization loss to the applied nitrogen ranged from 16.59 to 18.43 % with different nitrogen application amounts. The ammonia volatilization loss peaked within the first 3 days after fertilization, which accounted for 65-82 % of the total ammonia loss in each period. We observed the following degree of the effects of various factors on ammonia volatilization: NH4 (+)-N concentration of surface water > urea application amount > pH of surface water > days after fertilization > water temperature of surface water. The wind velocity and rainfall were the key factors affecting ammonia volatilization. The model of ammonia volatilization flux was established by using the measured dates from 2013 and was represented as Y = 0.008(x(1) + x(2) + x(3)) + e(0.056x4-0.068x5)-0.623 (R (2) = 0.81, P < 0.0001). The model was verified by using the measured dates from 2012. The calculated values fitted well with the field observations. However, the model parameters need to be amended using the model to predict the ammonia volatilization flux in the rice season from other regions.																			1385-1314	1573-0867				JAN	2015	101	1					139	152		10.1007/s10705-014-9660-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-014-9660-7													WOS:000347287800009

Coupling age-structured stock assessment and fish bioenergetics models: a system of time-varying models for quantifying piscivory patterns during the rapid trophic shift in the main basin of Lake Huron	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We quantified piscivory patterns in the main basin of Lake Huron during 1984-2010 and found that the biomass transfer from prey fish to piscivores remained consistently high despite the rapid major trophic shift in the food webs. We coupled age-structured stock assessment models and fish bioenergetics models for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), walleye (Sander vitreus), and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). The model system also included time-varying parameters or variables of growth, length-mass relations, maturity schedules, energy density, and diets. These time-varying models reflected the dynamic connections that a fish cohort responded to year-to-year ecosystem changes at different ages and body sizes. We found that the ratio of annual predation by lake trout, Chinook salmon, and walleye combined with the biomass indices of age-1 and older alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) increased more than tenfold during 1987-2010, and such increases in predation pressure were structured by relatively stable biomass of the three piscivores and stepwise declines in the biomass of alewives and rainbow smelt. The piscivore stability was supported by the use of alternative energy pathways and changes in relative composition of the three piscivores. In addition, lake whitefish became a new piscivore by feeding on round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Their total fish consumption rivaled that of the other piscivores combined, although fish were still a modest proportion of their diet. Overall, the use of alternative energy pathways by piscivores allowed the increases in predation pressure on dominant diet species.					; Bence, James/E-5057-2017	Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2015	72	1					7	23		10.1139/cjfas-2014-0161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0161													WOS:000347298300002

Bioaccumulation of microcystins (MCs) in four fish species from Lake Taihu, China: Assessment of risks to humans	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microcystins (MCs) are the toxic products of harmful algal blooms and they accumulate in fish. The accumulation of MCs in fish living in different trophic levels from different parts of Lake Taihu was determined. This information was then used to evaluate the risks posed by the MCs in fish to human health. The concentrations of three MCs, MC-LR, MC-YR and MC-RR, were quantified in the following four fish species: silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), crucian carp (Carassius auratus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio), using high performance liquid chromatography interfaced with tandem (triple quadrupole) mass spectrometry. The mean concentrations of MCs in the muscle, the kidney, the intestinal wall and the heart were significantly different among the four fishes except in the liver. C carpio contained the highest mean concentration of MCs in the muscle (31.7 +/- 12.1 ng/g, dry mass (dm)), whereas C. auratus had the highest mean concentrations of MCs in the liver (45.4 +/- 44.5 ng/g, dm), kidney (114 +/- 51.1 ng/g, dm), intestinal wall (2.04 x 10(3) +/- 4.43 x 103 ng/g, dm) and heart (59.5 +/- 26.7 ng/g, dm). The mean concentration of MCs in the intestinal walls of the fish species was significantly higher than in other organs (p < 0.01). The fish from Meiliang Bay had significantly higher concentrations of MCs than those from the centre, west or south banks of the lake (p < 0.01). The body lengths and masses of the fish were negatively correlated with the concentrations of MCs in the kidney (p < 0.05) and heart (p < 0.01). The average daily intake (ADI) of MCs in the muscle of all fishes exceeded the provisional tolerable daily intake (TDI) set by World Health Organization. The estimated daily intakes of MCs in 55.6% of the muscle samples exceeded the TDI.

The sensitivity of physical schemes in numerical weather prediction models for extreme precipitation is a significant challenge. To simulate a heavy precipitation process from 1 July 2020 to 10 July 2020 over the Poyang Lake Basin, where floods occur frequently, the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) was employed. The observation (OBS) from 92 meteorological stations was applied to evaluate WRF performance. To assess the optimal parameter, 27 combinations of multiphysics schemes based on three cumulus schemes (CUs), three microphysical schemes (MPs) and three land surface schemes (LSMs) were employed in WRF simulation. The Euclid distance (ED) was derived to evaluate the performance of the modelled total cumulative precipitation (TCP). The results showed that the simulation generally reproduced the spatial distribution of precipitation and captured the storm centre. In general, WRF underestimated the observation for most areas but overestimated the observation in the northeastern part of the basin. For total cumulative precipitation (TCP), the spatial correlation coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 0.8. M11 had the highest value of 0.796. The scores (TS, POD, FAR) of M15 were 0.66, 0.79, and 0.21, respectively. With the maximum similarity of 0.518, M7 (BMJ-WDM6-Noah) showed the best performance in ED based on six evaluation metrics. The mean values of OBS and M19 were 259.34 and 218.33 mm, respectively. M19 (NT-Thompson-Noah) was closest to the OBS for the range of the TCP. In terms of daily precipitation, the CC of M3 was maximum (0.96), and the RMSE of M24 was minimum (11.9 mm. day(-1)). The minimum error between the simulation and OBS was found for M3 (NT-Thompson-Noah). Therefore, with a comprehensive evaluation, five optimal combinations of physical schemes (M22, M19, M9, M3, M21) were found for the PLB, which is of great significance for extreme precipitation simulation and flood forecasting.

In this study, Four Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was utilized to detect, map, and analyze flood water inundations in the 2020 extreme wet season. Besides this, HEC-RAS 2D (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System) hydrodynamic model was utilized for result validation and comparison. Doing so, Sentinel-1A VV polarized SAR data sets were selected, and histogram-based thresholding method was applied to extract flood and non-flood inundated areas. The result showed that flood inundated area was about 32.02 km(2) on July 04, 2020, 79.96 km(2) on July 28, 2020, 127.48 km(2) on August 09, 2020, and 83.89 km(2) on August 21, 2020. Flood water expansion was linearly increased from 04 July up to 09 August, which was about 95.46 km(2 )and reached its peak stage on August 09, 2020. Afterward, from the period of 09-August 21, 2020, the flood was receded and decreased by 43.59 km(2). In contrast, the Hydrodynamic model was used to simulate flood inundations based on Ribe and the Gumara River time-series discharge data. The model simulation determines the flooding extent of the study area on August 09, 2020, and the result shows an inundation area of 135 km(2), which is similar to flood inundations extracted by SAR imagery. Generally, floodwater was expanded towards Ribe and Gumara river courses, on wetlands, depression areas, and along Lake Tana shoreline, where the elevation was extremely low. Therefore, a Time-based flood inundation map extracted from SAR images can give valuable information for the analysis of flood propagation and flood risk management.

J	Sugrue, D; Adriaens, P				Sugrue, Dennis; Adriaens, Peter			A data fusion approach to predict shipping efficiency for bulk carriers	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW												Maritime waterways are critical transportation systems that connect economies and manufacturing centers. Growing demand for freight movement, along with industry commitment to minimize its environmental impact, has increased emphasis on port and vessel efficiency. Yet, few objective performance measures exist to inform decision making for system improvements. There is an existing gap in quantifiable and objective metrics for maritime transport systems which motivated this work to investigate waterway performance efficiencies through big data analytics. Availability of big data affords practitioners and researchers the opportunity to develop new performance-based metrics to improve maritime logistics. This study focused on short sea shipping logistics of iron ore in the Great Lakes and makes three fundamental contributions. Principally, we propose a maritime transport efficiency (MTE) metric attained through fusion of data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and navigation lock data that integrates travel time and vessel payload. We present a linear model to predict vessel capacity based on water surface elevation which will enable practitioners to better adapt to seasonal changes and dredging needs specific to the Great Lakes. Additionally, we present travel time statistics for bulk carriers on the waterway observed through historical AIS data which extends the body of knowledge from earlier works and establishes a reference for system performance. Techniques presented here are effective in capturing travel time statistics in a non-linear interconnected system. This data-driven approach offers new insights for logistics planning and optimization with direct applications to short sea shipping and inland waterways systems. These insights to port and fleet performance allow for querying and simulation of cost impact from investment strategies aimed to improve efficiency or maximize value for operational expenses.

In this study, the vegetation dynamics during 20002015 were investigated in the downstream area of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in Northwest China where an ecological water diversion project (EWDP) commenced in 2000. The spatio-temporal relationships between vegetation cover and climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) and available water resources (river flow and groundwater) were determined. The results indicated that the mean growing season NDVI increased significantly during the period of 2000-2015, and the area of East Juyan Lake (EJL) enlarged to 36.4 km(2) in 2010. The scale effect of the relationships between NDVI and hydro-climatic factors was obvious. At the catchment scale, changes of NDVI were not significantly correlated with climatic factors, but significantly related with the antecedent 1year river flow. River flow played an important role in vegetation growth within approximately 2000m distance from the river bank. At the pixel scale, the changes of NDVI were significantly positive with temperature and river flow in 17.40% and 7.14% of the study area, respectively, whereas significant relationship between NDVI and precipitation occurred in only 0.65% of study area. The suitable water table depth for vegetation growth was between 1.8 and 3.5 m. The increased river flow and recovered groundwater due to the EWDP were critical for the improvement of vegetation cover, whereas the riparian vegetation degraded along some parts of the river bank. It is important to improve integrated watershed management with consideration of spatio-temporal lagged hydro-ecological connections in the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The overall concentrations of the target compounds ranged from 0.15 to 2.75 mu g/L in the surface water and from 0.43 to 377 mu g/L in the emission sources. Relatively high concentration levels were observed in August, during which the rainy season typically occurred in the study area, indicating seasonal emission sources. The spatial distribution revealed severe phenolic-compound contamination in the northeast part of the study area. According to the relationships between the surface water and emission sources, combined-sewer overflow and surface runoff from agricultural activities were identified as seasonal emission sources that were responsible for the increased concentration levels in wet seasons. Indirect discharge of industrial wastewater was proposed as a persistent emission source responsible for the severe contamination level in the northeast region over the entire sampling period, accounting for 16.5% of the phenolic-compound load in a demonstration river section. The findings of this study are useful for identifying the sources of phenolic compounds and controlling the contamination from the main sources in a typical industrial city. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple plant-wax compounds record differential sources and ecosystem structure in large river catchments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The concentrations, distributions, and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) of plant waxes carried by fluvial suspended sediments contain valuable information about terrestrial ecosystem characteristics. To properly interpret past changes recorded in sedimentary archives it is crucial to understand the sources and variability of exported plant waxes in modern systems on seasonal to inter-annual timescales. To determine such variability, we present concentrations and delta C-13 compositions of three compound classes (n-alkanes, n-alcohols, n-alkanoic acids) in a 34-month time series of suspended sediments from the outflow of the Congo River. We show that exported plant-dominated n-alkanes (C-25-C-35) represent a mixture of C-3 and C-4 end members, each with distinct molecular distributions, as evidenced by an 8.1 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand (+/- 1 sigma standard deviation) spread in delta C-13 values across chain-lengths, and weak correlations between individual homologue concentrations (r = 0.52-0.94). In contrast, plant-dominated n-alcohols (C-26-C-36) and n-alkanoic acids (C-26-C-36) exhibit stronger positive correlations (r = 0.70-0.99) between homologue concentrations and depleted delta C-13 values (individual homologues average <=-31.3% and -30.8 parts per thousand, respectively), with lower delta C-13 variability across chain-lengths (2.6 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand and 2.0 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, respectively). All individual plant-wax lipids show little temporal delta C-13 variability throughout the time-series (1 sigma <= 0.9 parts per thousand), indicating that their stable carbon isotopes are not a sensitive tracer for temporal changes in plant-wax source in the Congo basin on seasonal to inter-annual timescales. Carbon-normalized concentrations and relative abundances of n-alcohols (19-58% of total plant-wax lipids) and n-alkanoic acids (26-76%) respond rapidly to seasonal changes in runoff, indicating that they are mostly derived from a recently entrained local source. In contrast, a lack of correlation with discharge and low, stable relative abundances (5-16%) indicate that n-alkanes better represent a catchment-integrated signal with minimal response to discharge seasonality. Comparison to published data on other large watersheds indicates that this phenomenon is not limited to the Congo River, and that analysis of multiple plant-wax lipid classes and chain lengths can be used to better resolve local vs. distal ecosystem structure in river catchments.

Bacterial community composition in the water column of the deepest freshwater Lake Baikal as determined by next-generation sequencing	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The composition of bacterial communities in Lake Baikal in different hydrological periods and at different depths (down to 1515 m) has been analyzed using pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3 variable region. Most of the resulting 34 562 reads of the Bacteria domain have clustered into 1693 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified with the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria. It has been found that their composition at the family level and relative contributions to bacterial communities distributed over the water column vary depending on hydrological period. The number of OTUs and the parameters of taxonomic richness (ACE, Chao1 indices) and diversity (Shannon and inverse Simpson index) reach the highest values in water layers. The composition of bacterial communities in these layers remains relatively constant, whereas that in surface layers differs between hydrological seasons. The dynamics of physicochemical conditions over the water column and their relative constancy in deep layers are decisive factors in shaping the pattern of bacterial communities in Lake Baikal.					; Galachyants, Yuri/J-4633-2018; Likhoshway, Yelena/J-4496-2018; Domysheva, Valentina/HKO-1427-2023; Petrova, Darya/J-7615-2016	Petrova, Darya/0000-0003-3121-467X; Petrova, Darya/0000-0002-5594-504X; Likhoshway, Yelena/0000-0002-2432-9260; Likhoshway, Yelena/0000-0001-5745-6891; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				JUL	2016	92	7							fiw094	10.1093/femsec/fiw094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiw094								27162182					WOS:000379693700005

However, the features of microbiota assembly, abundance and diversity in plateau lakes remain unclear. The microbial communities in surface water from nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Plateau, southwestern China, in the dry and rainy seasons were explored using 16S rRNA gene and 18S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that the bacterial community compositions were homogeneous while those of micro-eukaryotes were hetero-geneous in plateau lakes. In both seasons, the bacterial phyla of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota predomi-nated in oligotrophic lakes. The mesotrophic lakes were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota and Cyanobacteria. The eutrophic lakes were mainly dominated by Proteobacteria, Actino-bacteriota and Cyanobacteria. The phylum SAR_k_norank had the major micro-eukaryotes in these plateau lakes. The alpha-diversity of bacteria declined in the rainy season, while that of micro-eukaryotes varied from lake to lake. The drivers of microbiotic community assembly in the dry season were identified as nutrient level-related factors. In the rainy season, however, the microbiota in oligotrophic lakes were related to nutrient levels. Mi-crobial communities were driven by precipitation in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes with large water volumes, while those in lakes with small water volumes were regulated by nutrient level-related factors. Our findings pose first and unique insights into the microbiota of the nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Plateau, providing important ecological knowledge for these lakes with different characteristics.

Amazonian rivers transport and process large fluxes of terrestrial DOM, but little is known about the link between DOM composition and heterotrophic bacteria in the Amazon basin. The aims of this study were to characterize DOM composition and investigate the coupling between DOM and bacterial community composition (BCC) during a complete hydrological cycle in an Amazon floodplain system (lake Janauaca). Our study revealed a clear seasonal pattern in DOM composition through the flood pulse, which affected the amounts of autochthonous and allochthonous inputs and consequently the extent of humification, molecular weight, and aromaticity of the DOM. BCC was tightly coupled to DOM fluorescence, which was also driven by differences over the hydrological cycle, with distinct components and operational taxonomic units being simultaneously more abundant and correlating with a specific season. This coupling was particularly well reflected for three of the four identified fluorescence components, two terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C3) and an autochthonous component (C4). Despite clear changes in DOM composition, dissolved organic carbon concentrations tended to be relatively stable throughout the year. Overall, our results suggest that BCC shifts were associated with DOM quality but not with its quantity (that remains relatively constant throughout the year), and that bacteria preferably use labile and freshly produced DOM in lake Janauaca.

J	Altunkaynak, A				Altunkaynak, Abdusselam			Predicting Water Level Fluctuations in Lake Van Using Hybrid Season-Neuro Approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Predicting water level fluctuations in a lake is crucial in terms of sustainable water supply planning, flood control, management of water resources, shoreline maintenance, sustainability of ecosystem, and economic development. This study developed a new predictive model based on the season algorithm (SA) and multilayer perceptron (MP) methods to improve prediction accuracy and extend water-level lead-time prediction. For the first time, the additive season algorithm (ASA) was used as an alternative data preprocessing technique for predicting water levels, and its performance was compared with that of wavelet transform (WT). The prediction accuracy and longer lead-time predictions were improved by the hybrid additive season algorithm-multilayer perceptron (ASA-MP) model. The results indicated that the hybrid additive season algorithm-multilayer perceptron model can be used to predict monthly water levels accurately with up to a 12-month lead time. The combined wavelet-multilayer perceptron (W-MP) model can be used to predict monthly water levels up to 6 months in advance with good agreement, whereas the standalone multilayer perceptron (MP) model can be used to predict the water levels up to 2 months in advance. The combined additive season algorithm-multilayer perceptron model outperformed the W-MP and standalone MP models based on the mean squared error (MSE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (CE) as performance evaluation criteria. As opposed to the ASA, the WT method has serious drawbacks and complicated mathematical processes. Furthermore, the prediction performance of the W-MP model was not satisfactory. The results of this study indicated that the ASA-MP model outperformed the W-MP model at all lead times. This implies that the season algorithm can effectively eliminate periodicity and trend cycles from original data better than the wavelet transform. In addition, the MP model should be combined with a preprocessing technique for more-accurate and longer lead-time predictions.

Hydrochemistry and water quality of Rewalsar Lake of Lesser Himalaya, Himachal Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The present research is to study hydrochemistry and water quality of Rewalsar Lake during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons. The Ca2+ and Na+ are observed as the dominant cations from pre- to post-monsoon season. On the other hand, HCO3- and Cl- are observed dominant anions during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, whereas HCO3- and SO42- during post-monsoon season. The comparison of alkaline earth metals with alkali metals and total cations (Tz(+)) has specified that the carbonate weathering is the dominant source of major ions in the water of lake. The HCO3- is noticed to be mainly originated from carbonate/calcareous minerals during monsoon and post-monsoon, but through silicate minerals during pre-monsoon. The SO42- in Rewalsar Lake is produced by the dissolution of calcite and dolomite etc. The alkali metals and Cl- in the lake can be attributed to the silicate weathering as well as halite dissolution and anthropogenic activities. Certain other parameters like NO3-, NH4+, F-, and Br- are mainly a result of anthropogenic activities. The alkaline earth metals are found to surpass over alkali metals, whereas weak acid (HCO3-) exceed to strong acid (SO42-). The Piper diagram has shown Ca2+-HCO3- type of water during all the seasons. The water quality index has indicated that the water quality of the lake is unsuitable for drinking from pre-to post-monsoon. Several parameters like salinity index, sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percent, residual sodium carbonate, magnesium hazard etc. have revealed the water of Rewalsar Lake as suitable for irrigation.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2018	190	2							84	10.1007/s10661-017-6451-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6451-z								29344735					WOS:000424113700030

To date, the water quality of deep lakes has not received as much attention as that of shallow lakes owing to logistical challenges. This study investigated the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of phosphorus and related environmental variables in a large deep lake in the Yunnan Plateau, China (Fuxian Lake). Generally, the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP, R2 = 0.862), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP, R2 = 0.922), and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP, R2 = 0.889) exhibited a linear increase with the greater water depth, whereas the pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) showed decreasing trends. The TP, TDP, and DIP values were 0.012, 0.006, and 0.004 mg/L, respectively, in surface waters (0.5 m depth), and increased to 0.074, 0.065, and 0.062 mg/L, respectively, at 140.0 m depth. The averaged over ordering method demonstrated that DO and air temperature accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of TP, TDP, and DIP in the shallow water layer (0.5-20.0 m). In contrast, DO and pH accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of TP, TDP, and DIP in deeper water layers (40.0-150.0 m). As a warm monomictic lake, the higher observed phosphorus concentrations in deeper water and sediment potentially pose a risk of future eutrophi-cation in the Fuxian Lake. Our findings demonstrate that more efficient technical and management measures should be taken to reduce the external phosphorus load to Fuxian Lake, so that the load to and from the sediment will decrease eventually.

Brownification in Lake Bolmen, Sweden, and its relationship to natural and human-induced changes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: This study focuses on the twelfth largest lake in Sweden, Lake Bolmen and its catchment. Study focus: During the last decades the process of brownification has resulted in water with browner color, affecting water quality and ecosystems. The occurrence of brownification and its governing factors, especially with regard to the interaction with the environment, is not yet fully understood. This study therefore performed different statistical analysis to detect spatial and temporal patterns in brown color and associated forcing factors. In addition, models were developed to describe the water flows in the lake and their influence on the water color. New hydrological insights for the region: Seasonal variations in color are dominated by meteorological parameters such as precipitation and temperature, whereas long-term (decadal) variations are functions of trends in these parameters as well as changes in land use, primarily related to forestry. Modeling the water flows yielded the residence time for different sub-basins in the lake, indicating the effects of travel time on the color. Calculated wind-generated surface waves and their effects on resuspension showed that such events may occur on a limited event and time scale.

J	Crochemore, L; Ramos, MH; Pappenberger, F; Perrin, C				Crochemore, Louise; Ramos, Maria-Helena; Pappenberger, Florian; Perrin, Charles			Seasonal streamflow forecasting by conditioning climatology with precipitation indices	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Many fields, such as drought-risk assessment or reservoir management, can benefit from long-range stream-flow forecasts. Climatology has long been used in long-range streamflow forecasting. Conditioning methods have been proposed to select or weight relevant historical time series from climatology. They are often based on general circulation model (GCM) outputs that are specific to the forecast date due to the initialisation of GCMs on current conditions. This study investigates the impact of conditioning methods on the performance of seasonal streamflow forecasts. Four conditioning statistics based on seasonal forecasts of cumulative precipitation and the standardised precipitation index were used to select relevant traces within historical streamflows and precipitation respectively. This resulted in eight conditioned streamflow forecast scenarios. These scenarios were compared to the climatology of historical streamflows, the ensemble streamflow prediction approach and the streamflow forecasts obtained from ECMWF System 4 precipitation forecasts. The impact of conditioning was assessed in terms of forecast sharpness (spread), reliability, overall performance and low-flow event detection. Results showed that conditioning past observations on seasonal precipitation indices generally improves forecast sharpness, but may reduce reliability, with respect to climatology. Conversely, conditioned ensembles were more reliable but less sharp than streamflow forecasts derived from System 4 precipitation. Forecast attributes from conditioned and unconditioned ensembles are illustrated for a case of drought-risk forecasting: the 2003 drought in France. In the case of low-flow forecasting, conditioning results in ensembles that can better assess weekly deficit volumes and durations over a wider range of lead times.					; Perrin, Charles/J-2486-2014; Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009	Ramos, Maria-Helena/0000-0003-1133-4164; Crochemore, Louise/0000-0001-5776-6275; Perrin, Charles/0000-0001-8552-1881; Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAR 14	2017	21	3					1573	1591		10.5194/hess-21-1573-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1573-2017													WOS:000396741100002

The present study describes the creation of four simple metrics to estimate: 1. the ratio of 'green' vegetated areas to the 'blue' water spread areas, defined as the 'Green-blue ratio' (GBA); 2. The ratio of 'blue' water spread areas to 'built-up' ratio around the lakes, defined as the 'Blue to Built-up ratio' (BBA), 3. the percentage of impervious surface area (ISA) and 4. the pace of urbanisation in the dynamic zones (DZ) of urban lake environments. These new metrics were evaluated using landcover areas mapped from satellite imageries. Visual interpretation-based method was adopted to delineate the green, blue and built-up areas from Google Earth, which is suitable for wide range of users. The use of these metrics has been illustrated using available datasets for four representative lakes in Bengaluru city, India: Sankey tank, Ulsoor lake, Nagavarakere and Puttenahallikere. Significant spatio-temporal variations in the ratios of GBA and BBA as well as %ISA were observed and satisfactorily reflected the ecological status of these lakes in concurrence with earlier studies. Detailed analyses constrained a permissible rate of annual increase in the built-up area within the DZs to similar to 3% for sustainable development of the lakes. The present set of metrics can be recommended as useful tools for urban planners and citizen scientists for seasonal monitoring of urban lake environments.

Past studies have well documented their effects on downstream aquatic ecosystems, which have included disrupting hydrological regimes as well as nutrient delivery, cycling and mediating processes that affect primary production. However, how these infrastructure operations affect lake ecosystems where the infrastructures are situated remains poorly understood. In the present study, we used a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical lake model to quantify the potential effects of large lake sluice operations under extreme high water levels on current structure and water quality parameters of Lake Chaohu in China. We designed and simulated multiple operation strategies based on actual operation curves during the 2016 extreme rainfall season. The model successfully captured the water quality dynamics of Lake Chaohu during both the calibration and validation phases. Our results indicate that higher lake water release rates led to overall accelerations of the current velocity: however, the deceleration of along-shore current velocity along the shorelines was also evident. Higher release rates also resulted in rapid rises ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (IP) concentrations in the eastern lake basin, as well as a lake-wide rise of chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration. When the lake sluice was operated at its full capacity, mean concentrations of these four parameters increased by 5.21%, 558%, 9.6% and 7.46%, respectively. Modeling results demonstrate that the effects of lake sluice operations were still quite pronounced for four months after the operations. Modeling results also revealed that higher release rate during the operation phase may help decease TN and TP concentrations during the subsequent period. This study provides a useful perspective on how to support the planning and operation of large infrastructures in the face of climate change induced extreme events. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Paleohydrology of Eberswalde crater, Mars	GEOMORPHOLOGY					45th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium	SEP 12-14, 2014	Knoxville, TN					Eberswalde crater, Mars, contains a well-preserved fluvial distributary network in a likely deltaic setting. The meandering inverted paleochannels and closed drainage basin of this deposit support relatively well constrained estimates of channel-forming discharge (over an individual event flood timescale), runoff production (event and annual timescales), and longevity of deposition (geologic timescale) during the Late Hesperian to Early Amazonian Epochs. The width and meander dimensions of two inverted paleochannels reflect the channel-forming discharge from event floods (similar to 200 to 400 m(3)/s), the deposit surface indicates the level (-1400 to -1350 m) and surface area (410 to 810 km(2)) of the likely paleolake, and the topography and mapped extent of tributaries constrain the watershed area (5000 to 17,000 km2). Based on these results and terrestrial empirical constraints on evaporation and sediment concentration, we evaluated three hypothetical water sources: meltwater liberated by the nearby Holden crater impact (continuous deposition over similar to 10(1)-10(2) years), intermittent rainfall or snowmelt during finite periods controlled by orbital evolution (deposition over similar to 10(4)-10(6) years), and highly infrequent runoff or melting of accumulated snowpacks following distant impacts or secular changes in orbital parameters. Local impact-generated runoff and highly infrequent rainfall or snowmelt require unreasonably high and low rates of evaporation, respectively, to maintain the paleolake level. The local impact hypothesis alternatively depends on one flooding episode with very high concentrations of fluvial sediment that are inconsistent with morphologic considerations. Multiple primary impact craters in the area postdate Holden ejecta but were later dissected, indicating fluvial erosion long after the Holden impact Intermittent rainfall of similar to 1 cm/day and seasonal snowmelt are both consistent with our results over a deposition timescale totaling similar to 10(4)-10(6) years.

However, our comprehension of the prolonged impacts of eutrophication on these types of wetlands continues to be significantly limited. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed monthly physical-chemical variables and seasonal phytoplankton and zooplankton communities at the Taipa-Coloane wetland in Macau, China, from 2013 to 2019. Through the generalized additive model (GAM) and principal component analysis (PCA), we found that the aquatic system mainly exhibited interannual variations instead of seasonal variations, with nutrient loads and river discharge (turbidity and salinity) being the most prominent features affected by anthropogenic activities and climate change. Over the years, the increasing turbidity and phytoplankton showed that bottom-up effects predominated the aquatic systems. Under the bottom-up effects of eutrophication and turbidity, the phytoplankton communities showed high adaptation that MP and S1 occupied more dominance after 2016, with higher abundance but lower diversity. Moreover, the bottom-up effects further affected the structure of zooplankton communities. The dominance of rotifers filter feeders (RF) decreased over the years while middle copepods and cladocerans filter feeders (MCF) increased, implying a trend of zooplankton toward large size over time. Overall, our result reveals the bottom-up control pattern in the aquatic systems of small urban wetlands. This research provides valuable insights into the dynamics and responses of plankton communities to environmental changes in small urban wetlands, providing valuable information for future conservation efforts.					刘, 之威/M-3876-2015; Liu, Jinhui/AAU-5457-2021	Xing, Chengguang/0000-0001-6432-6227; Liu, Zhiwei/0009-0009-6386-3106													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC 15	2023	157								111271	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111271		NOV 2023											WOS:001121096500001

We found that in the present period (1980-2005), the spatial distribution of rainfall is simulated with an annual spatial pattern correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.76 for REMO driven by EC-Earth and 0.74 for REMO driven by MPI-ESM respectively when compared to CRU data. In terms of temperature, the annual PCC is 0.93 for the two REMO outputs. According to the climatology of Central Africa, we subdivided the study area into five sub-regions, we also noticed that the annual and seasonal PCC depend on the considered sub-region. For the future period (2070-2095), temperature is projected to increase following all the three scenarios. The rainfall amount is projected to decrease by up to 5 mm/day towards the end of the twenty first century under RCP8.5 scenario, and by 1-2 mm/day under RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios over Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Congo, north-western Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Lake Victoria. Significant decrease is predicted to occur mostly in the northern part of the domain under RCP8.5 scenario. However, future rainfall over High Lands of Cameroon, Adamawa Plateau, north-eastern DRC and Atlantic Ocean is projected to increase.

Influence of land use and land cover on the spatial variability of dissolved organic matter in multiple aquatic environments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Water quality of lakes, estuaries, and coastal areas serves as an indicator of the overall health of aquatic ecosystems as well as the health of the terrestrial ecosystem that drains to the water body. Land use and land cover plays not only a significant role in controlling the quantity of the exported dissolved organic matter (DOM) but also influences the quality of DOM via various biogeochemical and biodegradation processes. We examined the characteristics and spatial distribution of DOM in five major lakes, in an estuary, and in the coastal waters of the Mississippi, USA, and investigated the influence of the land use and land cover of their watersheds on the DOM composition. We employed absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy including excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis modeling techniques to determine optical properties of DOM and its characteristics in this study. We developed a site-specific PARAFAC model to evaluate DOM characteristics resulting in five diverse DOM compositions that included two terrestrial humic-like (C1 and C3), two microbial humic-like (C2 and C5), and one protein-like (C4) DOM. Our results showed elevated fluorescence levels of microbial humic-like or protein-like DOM in the lakes and coastal waters, while the estuarine waters showed relatively high fluorescence levels of terrestrial humic-like DOM. The results also showed that percent forest and wetland coverage explained 68 and 82% variability, respectively, in terrestrial humic-like DOM exports, while 87% variability in microbially derived humiclike DOM was explained by percent agricultural lands. Strong correlations between microbial humic-like DOM and fluorescence-derived DOM indices such as biological index (BIX) and fluorescence index (FI) indicated autochthonous characteristics in the lakes, while the estuary showed largely allochthonous DOM of terrestrial origin. We also observed higher concentrations of total dissolved phosphorous (TDP) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) in coastal waters potentially due to photodegradation of refractory DOM derived from the sediment-bound organic matter in the coastal wetlands. This study highlights the relationships between the DOM compositions in the water and the land use and land cover in the watershed. The spatial variability of DOM in three different types of aquatic environments enhances the understanding of the role of land use and land cover in carbon cycling through export of organic matter to the aquatic ecosystems.					; Silwal, Shekhar/OML-7770-2025; Singh, Shatrughan/O-3385-2019	Silwal, Suraj/0009-0000-2769-9606; Singh, Shatrughan/0000-0003-3758-3214; DASH, PADMANAVA/0000-0003-3851-6830; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	16					14124	14141		10.1007/s11356-017-8917-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8917-5								28417327					WOS:000402748300021
J	Aydin, E; Talinli, I				Aydin, Egemen; Talinli, Ilhan			Analysis, occurrence and fate of commonly used pharmaceuticals and hormones in the Buyukcekmece Watershed, Turkey	CHEMOSPHERE												The occurrence of 14 mostly used pharmaceuticals from different classes (antibiotics, beta-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and stimulant) and hormones in surface water in Istanbul, Turkey was investigated in this study. An important drinking water source, Buyukcekmece Lake and main rivers flowing into the lake were selected for the monitoring of the compounds. Sampling was conducted five different times in a year in order to observe seasonal changes. A rapid, robust and sensitive method using solid phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer was established for quantification of both pharmaceuticals and hormones. Limit of quantifications were between 0.5 and 1.1 ng L-1. Recoveries were between 72-119% and 61-98% for ultra-pure water and for surface water, respectively. All selected compounds were detected at least once in the samples. Some pharmaceuticals were detected as high as a few of micrograms per liter levels in the rivers. Most frequently detected compounds were caffeine and antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole). Synthetic hormone (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) was detected only 4 times corresponding least detected compound in whole sampling period. Field data confirms that amoxicillin is more prone to degradation with respect to other antibiotics. Estrone and 17-beta estradiol are converted to estriol by natural processes in surface water.

In this study, the hydrogeological and dual isotopic approaches were integrated to evaluate the seasonal and spatial variations of nitrate (NO3-) in the West Lake watershed, and to characterize NO3- sources and transformations. The results revealed that the geochemical facies of the water samples were dominated by Ca2+ + Na+ -HCO3- + SO42- in the surface water and transfer water, Ca2+ + Na+ -HCO3- and Ca2+ + Na+ -SO42- in the groundwater, which most likely reflect natural reactions and anthropogenic inputs. About 13% of the groundwater samples containing NO3- exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 10 mg N L-1 center dot NO3- was the dominant form of total nitrogen (TN) and was the main surface water contaminant in the West Lake watershed. The delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3) values indicated that the dominant NO3- sources in surface water were soil nitrogen (soil N) and chemical fertilizers, while the main NO3- sources in groundwater were soil N from the forest, chemical fertilizers and manure in the tea garden, domestic sewage from the small, old residential area in the forest as well as urban areas. The distribution of NO3- in groundwater was strongly influenced by land use. Results also suggest that there was significant nitrification in surface water and groundwater in the West Lake watershed, and that there were also denitrification processes in groundwater. The annual net fluxes of TN, NO3-, and NH4+ into the West Lake were 2.0 x 10(4), 4.0 x 10(3,) and 131 x 10(4) kg as N, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Lakes as sensors in the landscape: Optical metrics as scalable sentinel responses to climate change	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												As the lowest point in the surrounding landscape, lakes act as sensors in the landscape to provide insights into the response of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to climate change. Here a novel suite of climate forcing optical indices (CFOI) from lakes across North America is found to respond to changes in air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation at timescales ranging from a single storm event to seasonal changes to longer-term interdecadal trends with regression r(2) values ranging from 0.73 to 0.89. These indices are based on two optical metrics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quality: DOC specific absorbance (a*(320)) and spectral slope (S275-295), where the ratio a*(320) to S275-295 gives a composite climate forcing index. These indices of DOC quality are more responsive to climate forcing than is DOC concentration. A similar relationship between the component indices a*(320) and S275-295 is observed across a wide range of lake types. A conceptual model is used to examine the similarities and differences in DOC-related mechanisms and ecological consequences due to increased temperature vs. precipitation. While both warmer and wetter conditions increase thermal stratification, these two types of climate forcing will have opposite effects on water transparency as well as many ecological consequences, including oxygen depletion, the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy, and depth distributions of phytoplankton and zooplankton.

In this study, taking the Tonle Sap Lake in the lower Mekong as an example, a series of water-land boundaries with height attributes based on water level data were extracted from multi-temporal Landsat images without cloud cover using the optimal water index and the lakeshore elevation model (LEM) of Tonle Sap Lake was constructed. On this basis, with the help of the limited land-water boundary provided by the Landsat image over a longer period, long-term monitoring of the changes in the water area of the entire lake area was realized. The results show that the Landsat image data in conjunction with the LEM can effectively remove the effect of cloud cover in monitoring the change of long time series water bodies. Reconstruction of historical data on changes in the waters of Tonle Sap Lake with the proposed method shows that in the past 30 years, there has been no significant change in the water areas of Tonle Sap Lake in either the dry or rainy seasons. Water area changes of the lake have a delayed response of 1-3 months to changes in the water level of the Mekong River, which is more affected by the mainstream recharge. The water area of the lake is unaffected in the dry season; however, it is weakly affected in the rainy season by the Xiaowan and Nuozhadu hydropower stations in China.

In this study, the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of P export coefficient (PEC) from all the 2539 polders in Lake Taihu Basin, China were estimated using a coupled P model for describing P dynamics in a polder system. The estimated amount of P export from polders in Lake Taihu Basin during 2013 was 1916.2 t/yr, with a spatially-averaged PEC of 1.8 kg/ha/yr. PEC had peak values (more than 4.0 kg/ha/yr) in the polders near/within the large cities, and was high during the rice cropping season. Sensitivity analysis based on the coupled P model revealed that the sensitive factors controlling the PEC varied spatially and changed through time. Precipitation and air temperature were the most sensitive factors controlling PEC. Culvert controlling and fertilization were sensitive factors controlling PEC during some periods. This study demonstrated an estimation of PEC from 2539 polders in Lake Taihu Basin, and an identification of sensitive environmental factors affecting PEC. The investigation of polder P export in a watershed scale is helpful for water managers to learn the distribution of P sources, to identify key P sources, and thus to achieve best management practice in controlling P export from lowland areas.

Here, water exchange (represented by water age) was investigated through integrated hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling of the Hongfeng Reservoir, a poorly gauged reservoir in southwest China. The performance of the hydrologic model and parameter replacement among sub basins with hydrological similarity was verified by historical data. Results showed that hydrological similarity based on the hierarchical cluster analysis and topographic index probability density distribution was reliable with satisfactory performance of parameter replacement. The hydrodynamic model was verified using daily water levels and water temperatures from 2009 and 2010. The water exchange processes in the Hongfeng Reservoir are very complex with temporal, vertical, and spatial variations. The temporal water age was primarily controlled by the variable inflow and outflow, and the maximum and minimum ages for the site near the dam were 406.10 d (15th June) and 90.74 d (3rd August), respectively, in 2010. Distinct vertical differences in water age showed that surface flow, interflow, and underflow appeared alternately, depending on the season and water depth. The worst water exchange situation was found in the central areas of the North Lake with the highest water ages in the bottom on both 15th June and 3rd August, in 2010. Comparison of the spatial water ages revealed that the more favorable hydraulic conditions on 3rd August mainly improved the water exchange in the dam areas and most areas of the South Lake, but had little effect on the bottom layers of the other deepest areas in the South and North Lakes. The presented framework can be applied in other data-scarce waterbodies worldwide to provide better understanding of water exchange processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These seeps flow across iron duricrusts (referred to as canga in Brazil) into hydraulically restricted lakes in northern Brazil. Canga caps all of the iron ore deposits in Brazil, protecting them from being destroyed by erosion in this active weathering environment. Biofilm samples collected from these seeps demonstrated heightened biogeochemical iron cycling, contributing to the relatively rapid, seasonal formation of iron-rich cements. The seeps support iron-oxidising lineages including Sideroxydans, Gallionella, and an Azoarcus species revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In contrast, a low relative abundance of putative iron reducers; for example, Geobacter species (<5% of total sequences in any sample), corresponds to carbon limitation in this canga-associated ecosystem. This carbon limitation is likely to restrict anoxic niches to within biofilms. Examination of a canga rock sample collected from the edge of Lake Violao revealed an array of well- to poorly-preserved microbial fossils in secondary iron cements. These heterogeneous cements preserved bacterial cell envelopes and possibly extracellular polymeric substances within the microfossil iron-rich cements (termed biocements). Bacterial iron reduction initiates the sequence, and intuitively is the rate-limiting step in this broadly aerobic environment. The organic framework of the active- and paleo-biofilms appears to provide a scaffold for the formation of some cements within canga and likely expedites cement formation. The accelerated development of these resilient iron-rich biocements in the lake edge environment compared with surroundings duricrust-associated environments may provide insights into new approaches to remediate mined land, aiding to stabilise slopes, reduce erosion, restore functional hydrogeology and provide a substrate akin to natural canga for revegetation using endemic canga plant species, which have adapted to grow on iron-rich substrates.

A HOLOCENE HISTORY OF DYNAMIC WATER COLUMN REDOX CONDITIONS IN THE LANDSORT DEEP, BALTIC SEA	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The modern Baltic Sea is the world's largest anthropogenically forced anoxic basin. Using integrated geochemical records collected during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 347 from the deepest and one of the most reducing sub-basins in the Baltic Sea, Landsort Deep, we explore the degree and frequency of natural anoxia through the Baltic Holocene. A marked decrease in carbon-to-sulfur ratios (C/S) from the cores indicate the transition from the Baltic Ice Lake to the current brackish sea, which occurred about 8.5 kyrs B.P. Following this, laminations throughout sediments recording brackish deposition suggest sustained anoxia or extreme low oxygen, while high molybdenum (Mo) concentrations of >100 ppm and iron (Fe) geochemistry suggest water column sulfide accumulation, or euxinia, that persisted beyond seasonal timescales during deposition of two distinct sapropel units. Sedimentary Mo isotope values range from +1.11 to -0.50 permil, which are distinctly fractionated from modern Baltic seawater (+2.26 to -2.67 parts per thousand) and thus indicate that each of the sapropels experienced only weak and/or oscillatory euxinia-in contrast to the more stable euxinic conditions of more restricted basins. A shift in delta Mo-98 starting above the lower sapropel to a distinctly more negative range suggests particularly weak and oscillatory euxinia, with an enhanced contribution of manganese (Mn) redox cycling to Mo deposition relative to the lower portion of the profile. This conclusion is supported by extreme sedimentary Mn enrichments of up to 15 weight percent. We interpret the combined data to indicate episodic but major Baltic inflow events of saline and oxygenated North Sea water into the anoxic Landsort Deep that limited the concentrations and residence time of water column sulfide and caused episodic oxide deposition. Considering the temporal overlap between the most reducing conditions and periods of redox instability, we hypothesize that major Baltic inflows, as is observed today, lead to short-term instability while simultaneously supporting longer-term Baltic anoxia by strengthening the halocline. Ultimately, our results indicate that periods more reducing than the modern Baltic Sea have occurred naturally over the Holocene, but the characteristic dynamic saline inputs have historically prevented the relatively more widespread and stable anoxia observed in other classic restricted basins and will likely continue to do so.

J	Paix, B; Ezzedine, JA; Jacquet, S				Paix, Benoit; Ezzedine, Jade A.; Jacquet, Stephan			Diversity, Dynamics, and Distribution of Bdellovibrio and Like Organisms in Perialpine Lakes	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microbes drive a variety of ecosystem processes and services, but many of them remain largely unexplored because of a lack of knowledge on both the diversity and functionality of some potentially crucial microbiological compartments. This is the case with and within the group of bacterial predators collectively known as Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs). Here, we report the abundance, distribution, and diversity of three families of these obligate predatory Gram-negative bacteria in three perialpine lakes (Lakes Annecy, Bourget, and Geneva). The study was conducted at different depths (near-surface versus 45 or 50 m) from August 2015 to January 2016. Using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and cloning-sequencing approaches, we show that the diversity of BALOs is relatively low and very specific to freshwaters or even the lakes themselves. While the Peredibacteraceae family was represented mainly by a single species (Peredibacter starrii), it could represent up to 7% of the total bacterial cell abundances. Comparatively, the abundances of the two other families (Bdellovibrionaceae and Bacteriovoracaceae) were significantly lower. In addition, the distributions in the water column were very different between the three groups, suggesting various life strategies/niches, as follows: Peredibacteraceae dominated near the surface, while Bdellovibrionaceae and Bacteriovoracaceae were more abundant at greater depths. Statistical analyses revealed that BALOs seem mainly to be driven by depth and temperature. Finally, this original study was also the opportunity to design new quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers for Peredibacteraceae quantification. IMPORTANCE This study highlights the abundance, distribution, and diversity of a poorly known microbial compartment in natural aquatic ecosystems, the Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs). These obligate bacterial predators of other bacteria may have an important functional role. This study shows the relative quantitative importance of the three main families of this group, with the design of a new primer pair, and their diversity. While both the diversity and the abundances of these BALOs were globally low, it is noteworthy that the abundance of the Peredibacteraceae could reach important values.					; Paix, Benoit/JDV-9527-2023; Jacquet, Stéphan/AAJ-7846-2021	JACQUET, Stephan/0000-0001-6017-3892; PAIX, Benoit/0000-0001-8159-8574; Ezzedine, Jade A/0000-0001-7884-8675													0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2019	85	6							e02494-18	10.1128/AEM.02494-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02494-18								30635378					WOS:000460468400009

These effects were analyzed based on the field investigation of temporal dynamics in species composition and abundance of phytoplankton and environmental factors from September 2015 to August 2016. We firstly found that six dominant diatom species (Fragilaria nanana, Achnanthidium catenatum, Aulacoseira ambigua, Ulnaria ulna, Cyclotella meneghiniana and Asterionella formosa (Class Bacillariophyceae)), which accounted for 98.7% of the total abundance of diatoms and 46.8% of the total abundance of phytoplankton, showed an obvious seasonal succession. Then significant driving factors for seasonal shift of the dominant diatom species were selected by Redundancy Analysis. The result showed that water temperature and silicate were the main environmental factors affecting the growth of diatoms on temporal scales. Next, the regressions of water temperature and silicate and dominant diatom abundance were fitted in Generalized Additive Model separately, and the smoothers of water temperature and diatom species suggested that the dominant diatom species adapted to different optimum temperature ranges, which corresponded with the growth of seasonal changes. A positive linear correlation between silicate and diatom abundance was generated by Generalized Additive Model. Finally, the ordinal controls of water temperature and silicate on the growth of diatoms were analyzed on temporal scales specifically. We suggested that water temperature and silicate controlling the growth of diatoms in order. Diatoms grow well only when the two controlling factors simultaneously satisfy the growth conditions; as limiting factors, the two factors played their respective limiting roles in turn on temporal scales.					; Li, Dunhai/F-8851-2012	Li, Dunhai/0000-0002-1915-4216; huang, shun/0000-0001-9549-7328													2096-5508	2523-3521				MAR	2019	37	2					568	579		10.1007/s00343-019-8040-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-8040-1													WOS:000464895600016

Temperature Dependence of Photodegradation of Dissolved Organic Matter to Dissolved Inorganic Carbon and Particulate Organic Carbon	PLOS ONE												Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been studied for more than two decades. Usually, laboratory or "in-situ" experiments are used to determine photodegradation variables. A common problem with these experiments is that the photodegradation experiments are done at higher than ambient temperature. Five laboratory experiments were done to determine the effect of temperature on photochemical degradation of DOM. Experimental results showed strong dependence of photodegradation on temperature. Mathematical modeling of processes revealed that two different pathways engaged in photochemical transformation of DOM to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) strongly depend on temperature. Direct oxidation of DOM to DIC dominated at low temperatures while conversion of DOM to intermediate particulate organic carbon (POC) prior to oxidation to DIC dominated at high temperatures. It is necessary to consider this strong dependence when the results of laboratory experiments are interpreted in regard to natural processes. Photodegradation experiments done at higher than ambient temperature will necessitate correction of rate constants.

The Mekong River inundates the Tonle Sap every year, shaping a mosaic of natural and agricultural habitats. Ongoing hydropower development, however, will dampen the flood pulse that maintains the Tonle Sap. This study established the current underlying relationship among hydrology, vegetation, and human use. We found that vegetation is strongly influenced by flood duration; however, this relationship was heavily distorted by fire, grazing, and rice cultivation. The expected flood pulse alteration will result in higher water levels during the dry season, permanently inundating existing forests. The reduction of the maximum flood extent will facilitate agricultural expansion into natural habitats. This study is the most comprehensive field survey of the Tonle Sap to date, and it provides fundamental knowledge needed to understand the underlying processes that maintain this important wetland.					; Cochrane, Tom/M-8588-2015; Arias, Mauricio/H-5667-2013	Cochrane, Thomas/0000-0001-9705-9807; Arias, Mauricio E./0000-0002-8805-6353; 													0044-7447	1654-7209				NOV	2013	42	7					864	876		10.1007/s13280-013-0424-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-013-0424-4								23877417					WOS:000325357000007
J	Mihai, FC				Mihai, Florin-Constantin			Rural plastic emissions into the largest mountain lake of the Eastern Carpathians	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												The lack of proper waste collection systems leads to plastic pollution in rivers in proximity to rural communities. This environmental threat is more widespread among mountain communities which are prone to frequent flash floods during the warm season. This paper estimates the amounts of plastic bottles dumped into the Izvoru Muntelui lake by upstream rural communities. The plastic pollution dimension between seasonal floods which affected the Bistrita catchment area during 2005-2012 is examined. The floods dumped over 290 tonnes of plastic bottles into the lake. Various scenarios are tested in order to explain each amount of plasticwaste collected by local authorities during sanitation activities. The results show that rural municipalities are responsible for 85.51% of total plastic bottles collected during 2005-2010. The source of plastic pollution is mainly local. The major floods of July 2008 and June 2010 collected most of the plastic bottles scattered across the Bistrita river catchment (56 villages) and dumped them into the lake. These comparisons validate the proposed method as a reliable tool in the assessment process of river plastic pollution, which may also be applied in other geographical areas. Tourism and leisure activities are also found to be responsible for plastic pollution in the study area. A new regional integrated waste management system should improve the waste collection services across rural municipalities at the county level when it is fully operational. This paper demonstrates that rural communities are significant contributors of plastics into water bodies.

B	Duguay, CR; Bernier, M; Gauthier, Y; Kouraev, A		Tedesco, M		Duguay, Claude R.; Bernier, Monique; Gauthier, Yves; Kouraev, Alexei			Remote sensing of lake and river ice	REMOTE SENSING OF THE CRYOSPHERE												Lake and river ice play an important role in the biological, chemical, and physical processes of cold region freshwater. The presence of freshwater ice also has many economic implications, ranging from hydroelectricity and transportation (e.g., duration of ice-road and open-water shipping seasons) to the occurrence and severity of ice-jam flooding that can cause serious damage to infrastructure and property. In addition to its significant influence on bio-physical and socio-economic systems, freshwater ice is also a sensitive indicator of climate variability and change. Documented trends and variability in freshwater ice conditions have largely been related to air temperature changes. Long-term trends observable from ground-based records reveal increasingly later freeze-up and earlier break-up dates, closely corresponding to increasing air temperature trends, but with greater sensitivity at the more temperate latitudes. Broad spatial patterns in these trends are also related to major atmospheric circulation patterns originating from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, such as the El Nino-La Nina/Southern Oscillation, the Pacific North American pattern, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation. Despite the wide-ranging influences of freshwater ice and its robustness an indicator of climate change, a dramatic reduction in ground-based observational recordings has occurred globally since the 1980s. Consequently, satellite remote sensing has assumed a greater role in observing lake ice and river ice. This chapter provides an overview of the recent progress on remote sensing of lake and river ice. For lake ice, topics reviewed comprise the determination of: 1 ice cover concentration, extent nd phenology, 2 ice types; 3 ice thickness and snow on ice; 4 snow/ice surthce temperature; and 5 grounded and floating ice covers on shallow Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes. Regarding remote sensing of river ice, topics covered include: 1 the determination of ice extent, ice phenology, ice types, ice jams, flooded areas, ice thickness, and surface flow velocities; and 2 the incorporation of SAR-derived ice information into a GIS-based system for river-flow modeling and flood forecasting. The chapter concludes with an outlook on anticipated developments, in light of recent and upcoming satellite missions.

Manjurul			Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton community and functional groups in a tropical river	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Functional classification of phytoplankton could be a valuable tool in water quality monitoring in the eutrophic riverine ecosystems. This study is novel from the Bangladeshi perspective. In this study, phytoplankton cell density and diversity were studied with particular reference to the functional groups (FGs) approach during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon at four sampling stations in Karatoya River, Bangladesh. A total of 54 phytoplankton species were recorded under four classes, viz. Chlorophyceae (21 species) Cyanophyceae (16 species), Bacillariophyceae (15 species), and Euglenophyceae (2 species). A significantly higher total cell density of phytoplankton was detected during the pre-monsoon season (24.20 x 10(3) cells/l), while the lowest in monsoon (9.43 x 10(3) cells/l). The Shannon-Wiener diversity index varied significantly (F = 16.109, P = 000), with the highest value recorded during the post-monsoon season. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) identified significant variations among the three seasons (P < 0.0001, R = 0.9518). The similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis pinpointed Ulothrix spp. (Melosira granulate and Cymbella spp.) as the most contributory species are causing such a noticeable difference. Fifty-four phytoplankton species recorded during the study period were classified into 20 functional groups, whereas D/J/M/MP/X1 was considered the most abundant FG in the Karatoya River. FGs of the Karatoya River were influenced mainly by the nutrients (PO4-P and NO3-N) enrichments. As a novel investigation on FGs of phytoplankton in Bangladesh, this study recommends additional surveys in other rivers and floodplains to improve our understanding of phytoplankton diversity and functional groups.

Hence, this study investigated the impact of irrigation practices on the Gilgel Abay, Ribb, and Gumara fisheries. Methods include fish sampling below and above the weirs, expert interviews, key informant interviews, secondary data, and impact significance matrix methods. The data collection time was from July 2019 to June 2020. The analysis of the data was qualitative and quantitative. The existing irrigation system affects fisheries by blocking upstream spawning migration routes (Gilgel Abay Weir and Ribb Dam, for sure catch below the Gilgel Abay Weir, significantly higher than above the weir, Shannon Index (H'), P < 0.001). Besides, according to local sources, after 2007, Gumara and Ribb Rivers became seasonal because of excessive water abstraction for irrigation, resulting in mass fish-killing and the failure of juvenile recruitment to the lake. In one instance, we recorded the deaths of over 930 adults and juveniles on the Gumara and the Ribb Rivers. Succeeding low water volume, even non-fishers collect fish from the pools; and during spawning time, fishers target spawning migratory species at the weirs where the catch is prime is also the other problem. Other threatening elements canalso aggravate the impact. Hence, these impacts need to be ameliorated by practicing efficacious water use, catchment treatment, fishery management, fish ladder development, and factor alleviation can be solutions.					; Getahun, Abebe/NTR-3079-2025; Mingist, Minwyelet/AGZ-9342-2022; Tesema, Dagnew/ABF-2827-2021	Mequanent Tesema, Dagnew/0000-0002-4985-8310; 														2405-8440				MAR	2021	7	3							e06523	10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06523		MAR 2021						33817380					WOS:000637860300036

Quantifying submarine groundwater discharge in the coastal zone via multiple methods	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is now recognized as an important pathway between land and sea. As such, this flow may contribute to the biogeochemical and other marine budgets of near-shore waters. These discharges typically display significant spatial and temporal variability making assessments difficult. Groundwater seepage is patchy, diffuse, temporally variable, and may involve multiple aquifers. Thus, the measurement of its magnitude and associated chemical fluxes is a challenging enterprise. A joint project of UNESCO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has examined several methods of SGD assessment and carried out a series of five intercomparison experiments in different hydrogeologic environments (coastal plain, karst, glacial till, fractured crystalline rock, and volcanic terrains). This report reviews the scientific and management significance of SGD, measurement approaches, and the results of the intercomparison experiments. We conclude that while the process is essentially ubiquitous in coastal areas, the assessment of its magnitude at any one location is subject to enough variability that measurements should be made by a variety of techniques and over large enough spatial and temporal scales to capture the majority of these changing conditions. We feel that all the measurement techniques described here are valid although they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended that multiple approaches be applied whenever possible. In addition, a continuing effort is required in order to capture long-period tidal fluctuations, storm effects, and seasonal variations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cai, Y; Duguay, CR; Ke, CQ				Cai, Yu; Duguay, Claude R.; Ke, Chang-Qing			A 41-year (1979-2019) passive-microwave-derived lake ice phenology data record of the Northern Hemisphere	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												Seasonal ice cover is one of the important attributes of lakes in middle- and high-latitude regions. The annual freeze-up and breakup dates as well as the duration of ice cover (i.e., lake ice phenology) are sensitive to the weather and climate; hence, they can be used as an indicator of climate variability and change. In addition to optical, active microwave, and raw passive microwave data that can provide daily observations, the Calibrated Enhanced-Resolution Brightness Temperature (CETB) dataset available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) provides an alternate source of passive microwave brightness temperature (TB) measurements for the determination of lake ice phenology on a 3.125 km grid. This study used Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) data from the CETB dataset to extract the ice phenology for 56 lakes across the Northern Hemisphere from 1979 to 2019. According to the differences in TB between lake ice and open water, a threshold algorithm based on the moving t test method was applied to determine the lake ice status for grids located at least 6.25 km away from the lake shore, and the ice phenology dates for each lake were then extracted. When ice phenology could be extracted from more than one satellite over overlapping periods, results from the satellite offering the largest number of observations were prioritized. The lake ice phenology results showed strong agreement with an existing product derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data (2002 to 2015), with mean absolute errors of ice dates ranging from 2 to 4 d. Compared with near-shore in situ observations, the lake ice results, while different in terms of spatial coverage, still showed overall consistency. The produced lake ice record also displayed significant consistency when compared to a historical record of annual maximum ice cover of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. From 1979 to 2019, the average complete freezing duration and ice cover duration for lakes forming a complete ice cover on an annual basis were 153 and 161 d, respectively. The lake ice phenology dataset - a new climate data record (CDR) - will provide valuable information to the user community about the changing ice cover of lakes over the last 4 decades. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.937904 (Cai et al., 2021).

The core objective of this study was to compare the feeding ecology of stickleback and young Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in this unique situation to identify reasons for this unexpected dominance, a possible food niche and feeding time overlap, and to discuss consequences for the reshaped pelagic fish community. The diel feeding patterns and prey compositions of pelagic sticklebacks and juvenile (0+) perch sampled in October 2018 and March 2019 were studied analyzing stomach contents. The diets of both species mostly comprised zooplankton, with copepods appearing in the greatest numbers. Benthic and airborne insects were consumed occasionally, mostly by sticklebacks. Both species exhibited peaks of feeding activity early in the morning, afternoon and dusk, and in both species, stomachs were fullest at dusk. Stickleback stomachs contained about 20% more prey at night than perch, and mean estimated nocturnal stomach fullness values were almost 50% greater. Night feeding in sticklebacks was confirmed by digestive states, pointing to a possible competitive advantage over perch. Dietary composition varied over a 24-h cycle and the pattern of consumption of different prey varied between the species. Perch consumed more comparatively small cladocerans (Bosmina spp.), while larger Daphnia appeared more often in stickleback stomachs. In both species, seasonal variation in diet mirrored food availability, indicating some degree of opportunism. A Morisita-Horn index value of 0.95 confirmed dietary niche overlap between species, suggesting the large population of sticklebacks may exert a competitive effect on juvenile perch when resources are limited. Both the longer feeding periods and greater intake of nutritive high quality prey like daphnids can contribute to the rapid success of stickleback in dominating the pelagic zone of Lake Constance.

Novel predictors related to hysteresis and baseflow improve predictions of watershed nutrient loads: An example from Ontario's lower Great Lakes basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Eutrophication has re-emerged in the lower Great Lakes basin resulting in critical water quality issues. Models that ac-curately predict nutrient loading from streams are needed to inform appropriate nutrient management decisions. Gen-eralized additive models (GAMs) that use surrogate data from sensors to predict nutrient loads offer an alternative to commonly applied linear regression and may better handle relationship non-linearities and skewed water quality data. Five years (2015-2020) of water quantity and quality data from 11 agricultural watersheds in southern Ontario were used to develop GAMs to predict total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate (NO3-) loads. This study aimed to 1) use GAMs to predict nutrient loads using both common and novel predictors and 2) quantify and examine the variability in seasonal and annual nutrient loads. Along with routine surrogate model predictors (i.e., flow, turbidity, and seasonality), the addition of the baseflow proportion and the hydrograph position of flow observations improved model performance. Conversely, including the antecedent precipitation index minimally affected model performance, regardless of constit-uent. Seasonal and annual patterns in TP and NO3- load predictions mirrored that of the hydrologic regime. This study showed that parsimonious GAMs featuring novel model predictors can be used to predict nutrient loads while account-ing for the partitioning of surface and subsurface flow paths and hysteresis between streamflow and water quality pa-rameters that are frequently observed in a wide range of environments.

J	Xu, XL; Zhang, Q; Tan, ZQ; Li, YL; Wang, XL				Xu Xiuli; Zhang Qi; Tan Zhiqiang; Li Yunliang; Wang Xiaolong			Effects of water-table depth and soil moisture on plant biomass, diversity, and distribution at a seasonally flooded wetland of Poyang Lake, China	CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE												Hydrological regime has been widely recognized as one of the major forces determining vegetation distribution in seasonally flooded wetland. Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, has been encountering dramatic changes in hydrological conditions in last decade, which greatly influenced the wetland vegetations. To explore the relationships between hydrology and vegetation distribution, water-table depth, soil moisture, species composition, diversity and biomass were measured at a seasonally flooded wetland section at Wucheng National Nature Reserve. Three plant communities, Artemisia capillaris, Phragmites australis and Carex cinerascens communities, were examined which are zonally distributed from upland to lakeshore with decreasing elevation. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), spearmen correlation and logistic regression were adopted to analyze the relationships between vegetation characteristics and hydrological variables of water-table depth and soil moisture. Results show that significant hydrological gradient exist along the wetland transect. Water-table demonstrates a seasonal variation and is consistently deepest in A. capillaris community (ranging from-0.5 m above ground to +10.3 m below ground), intermediate in P. australis community (-2.6 m to +7.8 m) and shallowest in C. cinerascens community (-4.5 m to +6.1 m). Soil moisture is lowest and most variable in A. capillaris community, highest and least variable in P. australis community, and intermediate and moderate variable in C. cinerascens community. The CCA ordination indicated that variables of water-table depth and soil moisture are strongly related to community distribution, which explained 81.7% of the vegetation variations. Species diversity indices are significantly positively correlated with soil moisture and negatively correlated with moisture variability, while above- and belowground biomass are positively correlated with moisture. Above- and belowground biomass present Gaussian models along the gradient of average water-table depth in growing season, while species diversity indices show bimodal patterns. The optimal average water-table depths for above- and belowground biomass are 0.8 m and 0.5 m, respectively, and are 2.2 m and 2.4 m for species richness and Shannon-Wiener indices, respectively. Outcomes of this work improved the understandings of the relationship between hydrology and vegetation.

More specifically, we focus on the temporal evolution from the climatological to the sub-diurnal scales on a high-altitude saline lake ecosystem. We analyze the evaporation trends over 70 years (1950-2020) at a high-spatial resolution. The method is based on the downscaling of 30 km ERA5 reanalysis data at hourly resolution to 0.1 km spatial resolution data, using artificial neural networks to analyze the main drivers of evaporation. To this end, we use the Penman open-water evaporation equation, modified to compensate for the energy balance non-closure and the ice cover formation on the lake during the night. Our estimation of the hourly climatology of evaporation shows a consistent agreement with eddy-covariance (EC) measurements and reveals that evaporation is controlled by different drivers depending on the time scale. At the sub-diurnal scale, mechanical turbulence is the primary driver of evaporation, and at this scale, it is not radiation-limited. At the seasonal scale, more than 70 % of the evaporation variability is explained by the radiative contribution term. At the same scale, and using a large-scale moisture tracking model, we identify the main sources of moisture to the Chilean Altiplano. In all cases, our regime of precipitation is controlled by large-scale weather patterns closely linked to climatological fluctuations. Moreover, seasonal evaporation significantly influences the saline lake surface spatial changes. From an interannual scale perspective, evaporation increased by 2 1 mm yr(-1) during the entire study period, according to global temperature increases. Finally, we find that yearly evaporation depends on the El Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO), where warm and cool ENSO phases are associated with higher evaporation and precipitation rates, respectively. Our results show that warm ENSO phases increase evaporation rates by 15 %, whereas cold phases decrease it by 2 %.
