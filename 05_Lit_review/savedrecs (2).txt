J	Yu, HX; Wu, JH; Ma, CX; Qin, XB				Yu, Hong-Xian; Wu, Jun-Hua; Ma, Cheng-Xue; Qin, Xue-Bo			Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups and its relationship with the environment in river: a case study in northeast China	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												In this study, the concept of functional groups was applied for the first time to the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community of Mudanjiang River (northeast China). The environmental variables as well as the phytoplankton communities were determined in 2007. The river showed strong seasonal fluctuations in water physical and chemical condition. A total of 11 phytoplankton functional groups (C, D, E, J, MP, P, T, TB, W1, X2 and Y) were identified that included 30 species. Groups C (Asterionella formosa and Cyclotella meneghiniana), MP (Cocconeis placentula, Cymatopleara solea, Diatoma vulgare, Ochromonas fragilis, Pinnularia major and Ulothrix variabilis), P (Fragilaria capucina, Fragilaris sp., Aulacoseira granulate and Aulacoseira granulate var. angustissima), TB (Aulacoseira varians and Navicula exigua, Navicula radiosa), X2 (Chlamydomonas sp.) and Y (Chroomonas acuta, Cryptomonas ovata, and Cryptomonas sp.) were the dominant groups during the study period. Mudanjiang River phytoplankton functional groups exhibited a noticeable seasonality in which group Y was predominant in the winter and spring associated with greater soluble reactive phosphorus availability, group MP in the summer associated with ammonium-nitrogen availability, and group P in autumn associated with greater transparency. This study underscores the usefulness of functional groups in studying phytoplankton dynamics in this river, in which phytoplankton dynamics can be significantly affected by tourism.

J	Kisand, V; Noges, T				Kisand, V; Noges, T			Abiotic and biotic factors regulating dynamics of bacterioplankton in a large shallow lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Lake Vortsjarv (270 km(2), mean depth 2.8 in, Estonia) is an eutrophic and turbid lake (Secchi depth 0.5-1 m) with a high nutrient load (total nitrogen 1-2 mgN l-1, total phosphorus similar to50 mug P l(-1)) leading to a highly productive phytoplankton population (average chlorophyll a concentration 24 mug l(-1)). Seasonal dynamics of the main members of pelagic microbial loop - phyto-, bacterio- and protozooplankton - has been studied for several years (1993-1998) in lake. The most prominent characteristic of this naturally eutrophic, turbid shallow lake is an inter-annual water level fluctuation (3.2 m) which is in the range of its average depth. Bacterioplankton growth was favored by high water level whereas phytoplankton growth was favored by low water level. In autumn and sometimes in winter bacterioplankton production (BP) was unbalanced with respect to primary production (PP) (gross BP 20-90% higher than PP) suggesting to additional sources of organic carbon. The main grazers of bacteria were probably various ciliates. In contrast to most eutrophic and stratified lakes, the relative prevalence of the microbial loop over the linear phagotrophic food chain was obvious in this eutrophic shallow lake. The bacterioplankton showed a pronounced seasonal succession with low diversity at high production periods in summer and with high diversity at low biomass and production periods in winter and spring.

Tracking bowfin with acoustic telemetry: Insight into the ecology of a living fossil	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Little is known about the spatial ecology and behaviour of bowfin (Amia calva), despite the fact that it is an important freshwater carnivore, the last living member of the Amiiformes and effectively a living fossil. In the summer of 2013, acoustic telemetry transmitters were surgically implanted in ten bowfin captured in Toronto Harbour on Lake Ontario. Using a stationary acoustic telemetry array that covered most of the 18-km(2) harbour, the residency and movement patterns of bowfin were tracked from their release until November 2014. Detected bowfin ranged in size from 562 to 725 mm total length and included six males and three females (one female was not detected). Bowfin showed high site fidelity with most fish detections concentrated in embayments and within the Toronto Islands, areas characterised by relatively high stable water temperatures and submerged vegetative cover. Statistical modelling revealed that bowfin residency was significantly affected by season, body size, site-specific estimates of vegetative cover and an interaction between body size and season. Bowfin residency increased with vegetative cover and was highest for large fish during the winter and fall months. Despite the overall high site fidelity exhibited by individuals, several bowfin were mobile over the spring and summer months and moved 5.2-12.9 km among telemetry receivers in the inner and outer harbours. The results of this study provide insight into the seasonal habitat preference, home range size and activity level of this unique fish.

This paper examines whether roach invasion is associated with temporal change in the diet of pike in colonised systems. The seasonal diet of pike in three Irish lakes was compared between a historical (pre-roach) data set collated on a monthly basis in the 1960s and 1970s, and recent samples collected monthly over 1year in 2016-2017. Statistical models indicated a significant increase between sampling periods in the probability of observing cyprinids in pike stomachs, and corresponding significant decreases in the probability of observing perch or brown trout. Small pike were significantly less likely than large pike to have salmonid prey in their stomach. There were seasonal effects on diet, with invertebrates and sticklebacks being consumed more in Winter-Spring compared to Autumn-Summer. In the recent period, prey selection indices indicated positive selection for roach and negative selection for perch; indices for trout tended towards neutrality. The dietary shift in pike following the establishment of roach may have alleviated predation pressure on native trout (and perch), with implications for food web structure in invaded lakes.					o'reilly, seamus/AAD-4539-2022	Kelly, Fiona/0000-0003-3627-3871													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2019	837	1					205	218		10.1007/s10750-019-03972-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-03972-w													WOS:000472486800015
J	Bourbonniere, RA; Miller, WL; Zepp, RG				Bourbonniere, RA; Miller, WL; Zepp, RG			Distribution, flux, and photochemical production of carbon monoxide in a boreal beaver impoundment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Photochemical transformations are important processes in the production and distribution of carbon monoxide (GO) in lakes and oceans. Initial studies of dissolved CO concentrations, CO fluxes, and in situ photochemical production were conducted at a boreal forest beaver pond near Thompson, Manitoba. Dissolved CO concentration profiles are characterized by stronger vertical gradients during the summer months. Midday integrated CO content of the upper water column ranges from 5-6 mu mol/m(2) in the summer to 3-4 mu mol/m(2) in the autumn. Surface concentrations of dissolved CO increase after sunrise in both summer and fall, attaining up to 120 nmol/L by late afternoon in the summer compared with 50 nmol/L for the same time in the autumn. The do supersaturation ratio for this pond ranges from 37 to 875, which is 4-7 times higher than other freshwater systems studied. CO flux across the air-water interface, measured in static floating quartz chambers, tracks well with UV-A, UV-B, and full spectrum solar irradiance in the summer. The maximum flux measured at solar noon of 1.6 nmol/m(2)/s on Julian day 168 in June 1994 was 5 times higher than that measured at the same time of day and location on Julian day 269 in September 1995. The depth to which photochemical production of CO occurs is limited in these dark waters because of the strong absorbance of solar radiation by dissolved organic matter. In situ exposure experiments, conducted over 24 daylight hours, under autumn light conditions, indicated that up to 20 nmol of CO can be produced photochemically at 5 cm depth from 1 mg of dissolved organic carbon, rapidly decreasing to less than one fourth that amount below 7 cm depth. In situ photoproduction rates compare favorably with those from a theoretical model (GCSOLAR). Measured static fluxes are similar to what would be expected from a simple laminar film diffusive flux model given the measured supersaturation ratios or the in situ photoproduction rates as input values.

J	Benjankar, R; Kafle, R; Satyal, S; Adhikari, N				Benjankar, Rohan; Kafle, Ravin; Satyal, Shanti; Adhikari, Nirajan			Analyses of Spatial and Temporal Variations of Salt Concentration in Waterbodies Based on High Resolution Measurements Using Sensors	HYDROLOGY												Studies have shown that salt concentrations are increasing in waterbodies such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams in areas where deicers are commonly applied for winter road maintenance, resulting in degraded water quality. As the salt concentration varies spatially and temporally based on environmental and hydrological characteristics, we monitored high resolution (15 min) salt concentrations for a relatively long period (winter and spring season) at different sites (i.e., stream, urban-stream, roadside drain, and parking-lot drain) using multiple electric conductivity-based sensors. The salt concentrations were significantly different from each other considering individual sensors and different sites in both winter and spring seasons, which support past research results that concentration varies spatially. Parking-lot (1136 +/- 674 ppm) and Roadside (701 +/- 263 ppm) drain measured significantly higher concentration than for Stream (260 +/- 60 ppm) and Urban-stream (562 +/- 266 ppm) in the winter season. Similar trends were observed for the spring season, however, the mean concentrations were lower in the spring. Furthermore, salt concentrations were significantly higher during the winter (242 +/- 47 ppm to 1695 +/- 629 ppm) than for the spring (140 +/- 23 ppm to 863 +/- 440 ppm) season considering different sites, which have been attributed to the winter snow maintenance practice using deicers in past studies. All sites exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) threshold (salt concentration higher than 230 mg/L) for chronic exposure level for 59% to 94% and 10% to 83% of days in winter and spring seasons, respectively. The study has highlighted the usefulness and advantages of high resolution (spatially and temporally) salt concentration measurement using sensor technology. Furthermore, the salt concentration in waterbodies can vary spatially and temporally within a small spatial scale, which may be important information for managing water quality locally. The high resolution measurements (i.e., 15 min) were helpful to capture the highest potential salt concentrations in the waterbody. Therefore, the sensor technology can help to measure high resolution salt concentrations, which can be used to quantify impacts of high salt concentrations, e.g., application of deicer for winter road maintenance on aquatic systems based on the criteria developed by USEPA.																				2306-5338				JUN	2021	8	2							64	10.3390/hydrology8020064	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology8020064													WOS:000665190500001

In this study, we integrated field measurements and long-term Landsat-5/8 images to assess the water quality of Nansi Lake, one of the important water transport trunks of the east route of the South-to-North Water Diversion project in China. Results showed that water temperature of the lake in spring has risen by about 4.7 degrees C from 2013 to 2020. The CODCr and TP both showed a downward trend while NH3N presented an upward trend in spring and autumn after 2014. The TN concentration showed a linear upward trend in autumn after 2014. Comprehensively, the WQI and TLI in both spring and autumn increased slightly from 2013 to 2015, decreased rapidly in 2016, and then presented a linear increase trend, indicating that the degree of water pollution in Nansi Lake has continued to increase since 2016, and the nutrient status has changed from mesotrophic to mild eutrophication. The concentration of CODMn is highly positively correlated with CODCr and both closely connect with the content of BOD5 and TP. The NH3N, TP and TN are covariant with each other. Remote sensing-based Chla exhibited a gradual increase from about 10 mg/L in 1990 to 18.3 mg/L in 2005 and then linearly dropped and kept at around 10 mg/L after 2010. The change of water quality in Nansi Lake is highly correlated with the growth of population and the expansion of local fishery size, meaning a prolonged impact of social-economic development.

Accurately estimating nutrient concentrations and understanding their relationships with environmental factors are vital to develop nutrient management strategies to mitigate eutrophication. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data is used to estimate nutrient concentrations and analyze their responses to hydrological and meteorological conditions. Two well-accepted empirical models are developed and validated to estimate the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (C-TN and C-TP) in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir using Landsat 8 OLI data from 2013 to 2016. Spatially, C-TN decreased from the transition zone to the riverine zone and the lacustrine zone. On the other hand, C-TP decreased from the riverine zone to the transition zone and the lacustrine zone. Temporally, C-TN displayed elevated values during the late fall and winter and had lower values during the summer and early fall, whereas C-TP was higher during the spring and lower during the winter. Among the environmental factors, the rainfall and the inflow rate have strong positive correlations with the nutrient concentrations. TN is more sensitive to meteorological factors (wind speed, temperature, sunshine duration), and the spatial driving forces vary among the different sections of the reservoir. However, TP is more easily influenced by human activities, such as fishery and agricultural activities. Current results would improve our understanding of the drivers of nutrients spatiotemporal variability and the approach in this study can be applicable to other similar reservoir to develop related strategies to mitigate eutrophication.

Its population shows strong oscillations during the wet season due to summer precipitation-induced immigration away from the lake into adjacent rice fields. The effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation-driven precipitation on population abundance and growth of the vole species is not fully understood. We undertook an analysis of the combined data of 4 time series covering 1981-2006 from 4 different sites and a separate analysis on a single time series (1981-2006) from one site. Our results demonstrate that a dual effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation-driven precipitation on the population abundance of voles is time-dependent: precipitation in the current year has a positive effect, whereas precipitation in the previous year has a negative effect. The dual effect of precipitation on vole population is well explained by the unique interactions among vole population, precipitation water level and the lake beach habitat around Dongting Lake. We found that drier than average weather of the previous year benefited voles because their breeding habitats, lake beaches, were exposed for long stretches of time. Wet weather was found to increase the number of voles inhabiting rice fields because as the water level of the lake rose they were forced from beaches into surrounding rice fields. Summer precipitation in the Dongting Lake region was found to be positively associated with the sea surface temperature (SST) of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean of the previous year and winter SST and spring SST of the current year. Annual rates of increase in the vole population of the reconstructed time series are negatively associated with the vole abundance and autumn precipitation of the previous year and winter precipitation of the current years. These results suggest that both extrinsic and density-dependent intrinsic factors may affect population dynamics of the Yangtze voles.

Seasonal Dynamics of Daphnia galeata in a Reservoir at the Edge of the Tropics Before and After Yearly Stocking with Bighead Carp	TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL RESERVOIR LIMNOLOGY IN CHINA: THEORY AND PRACTICE	Monographiae Biologicae											We studied the seasonal dynamics of Daphnia galeata from April 2001 to August 2009 in oligo-mesotrophic Liuxihe Reservoir (South China). Until 2004, fish (mainly bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) was released yearly and accounted for 85% of total fish catch. The commercial biehead carp catch, 21 kg ha(-1) year(-1), suggests a substantial predatory pressure on zooplankton. In 2004, most of the fish were removed and commercial introductions ceased. The abundance of D. galeata was low (from 0 to 1,500 individuals m(-3)) and with a clear-cut seasonal pattern: a decline in summer, absence in autumn, appearance in early winter, a peak in late winter (February), and a decline towards early summer. Edible nanophytoplankton biomass (<20 mu m) was low and was mostly composed of Cyclotella spp. and Peridinium pusillum. D. galeata peaked at low but non-zero abundances of edible nanophytoplankton, indicating that food limitation was not the direct cause of its absence in summer and autumn, when a relatively high edible nanophytoplankton biomass was present. In a first phase, from 2001 to 2004, D. galeata negatively correlated with water temperature. The high surface temperature (32 degrees C) during summer suggests that its development time and life span both shortened so strongly that its lifetime fecundity at that time sank below the threshold, at prevailing needed for maintaining an active population against the fish predation pressure. In 2005, a pelagic flatworm (Rhynchomesostoma sp.), supposedly suppressed by fish predation earlier, appeared. It fed on all zooplankton that it could catch and paralyze using a toxin that it also continuously lost to the environment and that remained active there for several months. Daphnia initially became more common, but its phenology became even more restrictive than before, and it now disappeared 1 month earlier, in July instead of August. Its negative correlation with temperature broke down, because by the time the higher temperatures in the reservoir were reached, it had already disappeared. Its place in the pelagic was taken by Ceriodaphnia quadrangula. Culture and enclosure work showed that the latter was less sensitive to flatworm toxin than Daphnia. Interestingly, the flatworms were susceptible to their own toxin, a possible auto-regulation mechanism.

C: N ratios decreased through our study indicating that OM largely originated from allochthonous sources in winter and autochthonous sources thereafter. delta C-13 were influenced by C-4 plant signatures and became increasingly light from winter through autumn. delta N-15 indirectly recorded the OM source shift through nitrate utilization degree with maximum values occurring in May as nitrate concentrations decreased. Unlike relationships from stratified systems, delta C-13 decreased with increasing algal biomass. This relationship suggests that minimal inorganic C fixation relative to supplies maintained photosynthetic isotopic discrimination during productive periods. Water column mixing likely maintained adequate inorganic C concentrations in the photic zone. Alternatively, OM isotopic composition may have been influenced by changing dissolved inorganic nutrient pools in this rapidly flushed system. delta N-15 also recorded increased N-2 fixation as nitrate concentrations declined through autumn. Secondary sediment transport mechanisms strongly influenced OM delivery. Particulate organic C and N deposition rates were 3X greater near the sediment-water interface. Isotopic ratio mixing models suggested that river plume sedimentation, sediment resuspension, and horizontal advection influenced excess sediment deposition with individual mechanisms being more important seasonally. Our findings suggest that allochthonous OM loading and secondarily-transported OM seasonally supplement phytoplankton production in productive reservoirs.					; Scott, Thad/AAF-7151-2020	Scott, Thad/0000-0002-9487-9698; Filstrup, Christopher/0000-0003-3812-2831													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2009	96	1-3					87	100		10.1007/s10533-009-9346-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9346-4													WOS:000270280500006
J	El-Shabrawy, GM; Dumont, HJ				El-Shabrawy, GM; Dumont, HJ			Spatial and seasonal variation of the zooplankton in the coastal zone and main khors of Lake Nasser (Egypt)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A prominent feature of Lake Nasser is the presence of khors ( dendritic side extensions). We studied the zooplankton of the larger khors and coastal zone of the main lake in 1996 and 1997, and found an assemblage of rotifers, cladocerans and copepods that was partly tropical, partly temperate, at relatively high biomasses. Spatial differences were weak, but the upstream khors ( Toushka and Korosko) were consistently richer than the downstream khors (El-Ramla and Kalabsha), with a rather sudden transition around km 150 at El Madiq. Summer standing crops were higher than those in winter by a factor 2 - 3. The zooplankton of the littoral of the main channel showed the same spatial pattern as that in the khors, being more abundant in spring (average 82 300 ind m(-3)) than in autumn (average 72 700 ind m(-3)). Zooplankton dry weight increased from 4 g m(-2) at khor El-Ramla to 7 g m(-2) at khor Toushka. These rather high values had low variation. The number of species, diversity and evenness all showed a high degree of similarity among the khors and in the littoral of the main lake. The lake fish fauna is poor, lacking a pelagic planktivore. The predominance of medium-sized Copepoda ( one calanoid, two cyclopoids) in the zooplankton suggests that fish predation is moderate. This is confirmed by the persistence of two Daphnia species at low abundance, although rather strong variations in time suggest that Cladocera suffer from summer predation by invertebrates ( copepods) as well as vertebrates ( mostly larval fish). Because the zooplankton is underutilised by higher trophic levels, we suggest to assess the benefits of introducing a pelagic zooplanktivorous fish.																			0018-8158					JAN	2003	491	1-3					119	132		10.1023/A:1024466216214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024466216214													WOS:000183771600011
J	SIEGFRIED, CA				SIEGFRIED, CA			THE BENTHOS OF A EUTROPHIC MOUNTAIN RESERVOIR - INFLUENCE OF RESERVOIR LEVEL ON COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, ABUNDANCE, AND PRODUCTION	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												The benthos of Big Bear Lake, California [USA], was studied from Dec. 1976-Nov. 1978. Oligochaetes and chironomid larvae dominated the benthic community, accounting for > 95% of the macrobenthic invertebrates collected at each study site. Procladius bellus and Chironomus plumosus were the dominant chironomid larvae of the lake. The general pattern of abundance was a spring population maximum followed by a decline to a late summer minimum and a recovery to a secondary peak in fall-early winter. Benthos abundance was significantly greater in 1977, a drought year, than in 1978, a high water year, at all sites except the deepest site, Station 1. The difference was related to O2 depletion at each site in 1978 but only at Station 1 in 1977. C. plumosus and P. bellus larvae occurred at nearly all of the 95 sites sampled in the study. P. bellus was generally more abundant but C. plumosus, being larger, dominated the standing crop. P. bellus had a bivoltine life cycle in Big Bear Lake, emerging in the spring and fall; C. plumosus had a univoltine life cycle with emergence in spring. O2 depletion differences significantly affected chironomid larvae abundance at each study site. Annual production of P. bellus was reduced from 2.94 g AFDW .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 in 1977 to 0.83 g AFDW .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 in 1978. C. plumosus production declined from 3.85 to 1.38 g AFDW .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1. The disappearance of chironomid larvae from the benthos during anoxic conditions appears to involve toxic effects as well as O2 depletion. Un-ionized NH3 concentrations exceed critical levels for fish and may be harmful to invertebrates. Hypolimnetic aeration appears to be beneficial to the benthos of Big Bear Lake. Treatment of a test plot with the herbicide dichlobenil to control macrophytes significantly reduced the normally diverse littoral fauna to one composed exclusively of oligochaetes.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1984	70	1					39	52																WOS:A1984SB19700004

"Overwintering" Microcystis colonies dominated the microbial community during all seasons, constituting 60-90% of the total microbial biomass. Expressed on an areal basis, the benthic biomass was, throughout the year, larger than or similar to the planktonic biomass during the peak of the summer bloom, indicating an ability of the colonies to survive in the sediments for extended periods. Abundance of "other", non-photosynthetic bacteria varied in the range 3.0-15.5 .cntdot.1010 cells g-1 d.w. over the year with minimum values in summer and maximum values in autumn in connection with the sedimentation of the Microcystis bloom. A substantial part of the non-photosynthetic bacteria, up to circa 40%, was associated with the mucilage of healthy Microcystis colonies. Bacterial production (3H-thymidine incorporation) appeared to be strongly temperature dependent and less influenced by the seasonal sedimentation pattern. Our data indicate an increasing proportion of non-growing cells in autumn and winter. Biomass-bound phosphorus constituted a significant portion, circa 10%, of the phosphorus content in Lake Vallentunasjon sediments. This pool has normally been overlooked in studies on phosphorus dynamics in lake sediments. Different mechanisms whereby organic phosphorus can be released from the sediments are discussed.

J	DUTIL, JD				DUTIL, JD			ENERGETIC CONSTRAINTS AND SPAWNING INTERVAL IN THE ANADROMOUS ARCTIC CHARR (SALVELINUS-ALPINUS)	COPEIA												Non-reproductive anadromous Arctic charr of Nauyuk Lake lost 30% of their fall reserves of energy by the following spring. They restored [Canada] their reserves of energy through a two month summer in the sea. Spawners became much more depleted. Production of gonads and starvation in the lake prior to spawning were such that postspawners migrating to sea in spring contained as much as 46% less energy than non-reproductive charrs. Postspawners required more than one summer to replenish their depleted reserves. These results provide an example of the phenotypic plasticity of the life history characteristics of Arctic charr and show that production of gonads and related changes in the migratory cycle prevent individual charrs from spawning 2 yr in succession. Length-related energy constraints possibly contribute to shaping the structure of the population and lead to senescence in charrs > 90 cm. The role of a threshold body condition as a release mechanism in the processes of maturation is discussed.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				DEC 23	1986		4					945	955		10.2307/1445291	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1445291													WOS:A1986F385500012
J	Straile, D				Straile, D			Meteorological forcing of plankton dynamics in a large and deep continental European lake	OECOLOGIA												The timing of various plankton successional events in Lake Constance was tightly coupled to a large-scale meteorological phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A causal chain of meteorological, hydrological, and ecological processes connected the NAO as well as winter and early spring meteorological conditions to planktonic events in summer leading to a remarkable memory of climatic effects lasting over almost half a year. The response of Daphnia to meteorological forcing was most probably a direct effect of altered water temperatures on daphnid growth and was not mediated by changes in phytoplankton concentrations. High spring water temperatures during "high-NAO years" enabled high population growth rates, resulting in a high daphnid biomass as early as May. Hence, a critical Daphnia biomass to suppress phytoplankton was reached earlier in high-NAG years yielding an early and longer-lasting clear-water phase. Finally, an earlier summer decline of Daphnia produced in a negative relationship between Daphnia biomass in July and the NAG. Meteorological forcing of the seasonal plankton dynamics in Lake Constance included simple temporal shifts of processes and successional events, but also complex changes in the relative importance of different mechanisms. Since Daphnia plays an important role in plankton succession, a thorough understanding of the regulation of its population dynamics provides the key for predictions of the response of freshwater planktonic food webs to global climate change.

J	GEDDES, MC				GEDDES, MC			THE ROLE OF TURBIDITY IN THE LIMNOLOGY OF LAKE ALEXANDRINA, RIVER MURRAY, SOUTH-AUSTRALIA - COMPARISONS BETWEEN CLEAR AND TURBID PHASES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												In the first months of 1981, the characteristically highly turbid Lake Alexandrina cleared somewhat so that turbidity dropped from a previous mean value (1975-1978) of 93 NTU to 9 NTU, the Secchi transparency and euphotic depth increased from previous means of 19 cm and 0.8 m to 72 cm and 3.1 m, and the light extinction coefficient fell from 6.54 to 1.2 ln units m-1. Low flows in the River Murray, especially low contributions from the Darling River, and high salinity appeared to be the major factors responsible for the clearing. During the clear phase, nutrient levels fell, the normal summer peak of the ulotrichous green alga Planctonema lauterbornei failed to occur, there was a late summer-autumn bloom of blue greens especially Nodularia and Anabaena, and densities of the large microcrustaceans Boeckella triarticulata and Daphnia carinata were low. After flushing, the lake turbidity rose to previous high levels and over the period Ocotber 1981-April 1982. P. lauterbornei again dominated the phytoplanktn, chlorophyll .alpha. biomass reached 67 mg m-3, and the zooplankton community returned to its normal pattern of seasonality and abundance.

The parameters constituting the main components of water mass were used in calculating the WQI. The results obtained showed that the water quality of pond ranged between high quality and very polluted water according to WHO and SWQR. Examining the water quality from the aspect of irrigation water, SAR, Na %, RSC, and KR did not pass beyond the limit values. MH value was found to be harmful for irrigation. According to the cluster analysis, the summer and autumn seasons and the winter and spring seasons were found to be more similar to each other. PCA was affected by four main factors explaining 86.41% of the total variance and it was determined that the main pollution sources of the pond were climatic factors, anions reaching the water and non-point pollutants. According to the annual mean values of parameters, WQI was found to be almost-good quality water. These spatial and temporal scale results will guide the future freshwater management practices.

Molecular Enumeration of an Ecologically Important Cyanophage in a Laurentian Great Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Considerable research has shown that cyanobacteria and the viruses that infect them (cyanophage) are pervasive and diverse in global lake populations. Few studies have seasonally analyzed freshwater systems, and little is known about the bacterial and viral communities that coexist during the harsh winters of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here, we employed quantitative PCR to estimate the abundance of cyanomyoviruses in this system, using the portal vertex g20 gene as a proxy for cyanophage abundance and to determine the potential ecological relevance of these viruses. Cyanomyoviruses were abundant in both the summer and the winter observations, with up to 3.1 x 10(6) copies of g20 genes ml(-1) found at several stations and depths in both seasons, representing up to 4.6% of the total virus community. Lake Erie was productive during both our observations, with high chlorophyll a concentrations in the summer (up to 10.3 mu g liter(-1)) and winter (up to 5.2 mu g liter(-1)). Both bacterial and viral abundances were significantly higher during the summer than during the winter (P < 0.05). Summer bacterial abundances ranged from 3.3 x 10(6) to 1.6 x 10(7) ml(-1) while winter abundances ranged between similar to 3.4 x 10(5) and 1.2 x 10(6) ml(-1). Total virus abundances were high during both months, with summer abundances significantly higher at most stations, ranging from 6.5 x 107 to 8.8 x 107 ml(-1), and with winter abundances ranging from 3.4 x 10(7) to 6.6 x 10(7) ml(-1). This work confirms that putative cyanomyoviruses are ubiquitous in both summer and winter months in this large freshwater lake system and that they are an abundant component of the virioplankton group.

However, there is a large terrestrial carbon sink is missing. The locations, magnitudes, variations, and mechanisms responsible for this terrestrial missing carbon sink are uncertain and the focus of much continuing debate. In order to provide a basis for the assessment of carbonate weathering-related carbon sink, this study investigated the spatial and temporal variations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), and used stable carbon isotopes and hydrochemical data to quantitatively estimate the proportion of DIC transformation to POC and analyze the potential influence of the transformation of DIC into OC on the carbon isotope composition in the Lijiang River (typical karst surface water), Southwest China. The results showed that DIC concentrations are high in winter and low in summer and increase from upstream to downstream. POC concentrations are high in summer and low in spring. delta C-13(POC) and delta C-13(DIC) are negatively correlated in the Lijiang River. The delta C-13(DIC) values are high in spring and low in summer, compared with the estimated delta C-13(DIC(cal.)); the observed delta C-13(DIC) values have a maximum positive shift in spring and similar in the summer; the delta C-13(POC) values decrease from upstream to downstream, and are high in summer and low in spring. These observations indicate that the isotopic compositions of both DIC and POC are significantly affected by aquatic photosynthesis that transforms DIC into OC. In-river primary production contribute 12-54% of POC, and the contributions of carbonate rock-sourced DIC to the riverine POC range from 7 to 30%, which suggests an important sink of atmospheric CO2 in river systems and should be taken into account in global carbon cycle.					; Zhang, Qinghua/G-3980-2019	Xiao, Qiong/0000-0003-4910-2895; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN 9	2020	79	12							295	10.1007/s12665-020-09039-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09039-7													WOS:000540960200004

The invasive North American channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque, 1818) is such a case, having been shown to not only have considerable impacts to native biodiversity, but also to expand its range. Several decades ago, I. punctatus was introduced to Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. This study investigates the seasonal dynamics of I. punctatus' trophic niche over three consecutive years. Stable isotopes analyses of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were utilized to assess isotopic niche variation and feeding habitat. Results demonstrate ontogenetic variations in I. punctatus' trophic position and feeding habitat, influenced by both season and year. Ictalurus punctatus exhibited a wider isotopic niche and greater interindividual dispersion during spring and summer compared to autumn and winter. While the occupied isotopic niche space remained stable across years, significant seasonal differences were observed in 2 out of 3 years. These seasonal differences underscore the high trophic plasticity of I. punctatus, facilitating its ability to exploit a diverse spectrum of resources. This research advances our understanding of this species' trophic traits and invasiveness, emphasizing the significance of considering seasonal variations in the ecological impacts of invasive fish species.

Results from the analysis of 2 years of event precipitation samples for Hg are reported here. The volume-weighted average Hg concentration in precipitation was 7.9, 10.8 and 10.2 ng/L for the Pellston South Haven and Dexter sites, respectively. Yearly wet deposition of Hg for 1992-93 and 1993-94 was 5.8 and 5.5 mu g/m(2) at Pellston, 9.5 and 12.7 mu g/m(2) at South Haven and 8.7 and 9.1 mu g/m(2) at Dexter. A. spatial gradient in both the Hg concentration and wet deposition was observed Northern Michigan received almost half the deposition of Hg recorded at the southern Michigan sites. The concentration of Hg in precipitation exhibited a strong seasonal behavior with low values of 1.0 to 2.0 ng/L in winter and maximum values greater than 40 ng/L in summer. The spring, summer and autumn precipitation accounted for 89 to 91% of the total yearly Hg deposition Mixed-layer back trajectories were calculated for each precipitation event to investigate the meteorological history and transport from potential Hg source regions. Elevated Hg concentrations were observed with air mass transport from the west southwest south, and southeast. At each of the sites precipitation events for which the Hg condentration was in the 90th and 10th percentile were analyzed for trace elements by ICP-MS to investigate source impacts.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					199	208		10.1007/BF01189668	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189668													WOS:A1995RM44200023

The measured denitrification rates (44 to 613 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1)) are among the lowest ever reported from lacustrine sediments. Denitrification rates varied both spatially and temporally, being highest in the profundal zone during midsummer and in the littoral zones during winter. Correlation analyses indicated that these variations were due to variations in the concentrations of nitrate and oxygen in the water overlying the sediment. The structure of the denitrifier community was temporally extremely stable and differed only slightly between the sites. Distance-based linear model (DISTLM) analysis indicated that the observed variation was probably due mainly to variations in the content of organic matter, and in the porosity, of the sediment. The structure of the denitrifier community and the denitrifying activities were uncoupled.

J	Davis, CA; Smith, LM				Davis, CA; Smith, LM			Ecology and management of migrant shorebirds in the Playa Lakes Region of Texas	WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS												During spring and fall migration, shorebirds rely on stopover areas to replenish energy reserves and fulfill nutrient requirements. Most studies of stopover areas have focused on wetlands in the Northern Great Plains; little attention has been given to wetlands in the Southern Great Plains, especially the Playa Lakes Region (PLR). Our objectives were to determine migrant-shorebird species compositions, abundances, migration chronologies, use of habitats, and feeding ecologies in the PLR during spring and fall migration. More than 130 playa wetlands were surveyed for shorebirds in a 34,000-km(2) area of western Texas. We selected American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), long-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus), least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), and western sandpiper (C. mauri) as a subset of all shorebirds present to examine feeding ecologies; these 4 species were common species during both migration periods and represent a wide range of body sizes and guilds. We also evaluated the influence of sex on the feeding ecologies of the 4 species. Thirty shorebird species used playa wetlands during spring and fall, 1993-94. The most abundant species during spring were American avocet, long-billed dowitcher, and Wilson's phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), whereas the most abundant species during fall were American avocet, long-billed dowitcher, long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus), stilt sandpiper (Calidris himantopus), and lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes). Migration chronologies of each species were distinct in spring with peak abundances occurring over 2-4 weeks and were protracted in fall with peak abundances occurring over 5-8 weeks. In general, most shorebird species selected playas that contained sparse vegetation (<25% vegetation cover), adequate amounts of mudflat (10-15%) and shallow (<4 cm depth) water (10-20%) habitats, and higher invertebrate populations. Invertebrates were the most important component in the diets of American avocets, long-billed dowitchers, least sandpipers, and western sandpipers, and diets varied little between males and females. In the spring, all 4 species consumed mostly chironomids, whereas in the fall, all 4 consumed a wider variety of invertebrates. Important invertebrate foods during the fall included chironomids, hydrophilids, leeches, planorbids, corixids, conchostracans, and hydracarinas. The 4 species also consumed more plant material (predominantly seeds) in the fall than in the spring. Differences in spring and fall diets of the 4 shorebird species were attributed to seasonal differences in invertebrate abundances and diversities; invertebrate abundances and diversities were higher in the fall than in the spring. Shorebird diets were compared with availabilities of foods within and across individual playas. For most foods, overall selection patterns (i.e., selection across playas) were different from selection patterns within individual playas. In general, all 4 species exhibited a nide range of selection patterns for invertebrates as availability of invertebrates changed, suggesting that the 4 species used an opportunistic foraging strategy. Shorebird foraging appeared to decrease invertebrate populations in spring, but not in fall. Management of playas in the PLR should focus on creating and maintaining sparse vegetation cover, and adequate mudflat (at least 10-15%) and shallow water (at least 10-20%) habitats. Because invertebrates are important foods of migrant shorebirds, management also should focus on enhancing invertebrate populations in playas. Gradual drawdowns of playas with deep water and flooding of dry playas should be used to provide available habitat for shorebirds throughout migration. Mowing and shallow disking can be used to create preferred habitat conditions and provide a detrital food base to enhance invertebrate populations. Managers that can manage only a few playas should consider managing playas during periods of maximum shorebird diversity in the PLR. During spring, maximum shorebird diversity occurred in late April and early May, whereas during fall, maximum shorebird diversity occurred in late August.																			0084-0173	1938-5455				OCT	1998		140					5	45																WOS:000076723100001

Analysis of the unique geothermal microbial ecosystem of the Blue Lagoon	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Cultivation and culture-independent techniques were used to describe the geothermal ecosystem of the Blue Lagoon in Iceland. The lagoon contains both seawater and freshwater of geothermal origin and is extremely high in silica content. Water samples were collected repeatedly in summer and autumn in 2003 and 2005 and in winter 2006 were analyzed for species composition. The study revealed the typical traits of an extreme ecosystem characterized by dominating species and other species represented in low numbers. A total of 35 taxa were identified. The calculated biodiversity index of the samples was 2.1-2.5. The majority (83%) of analyzed taxa were closely related to bacteria of marine and geothermal origin reflecting a marine character of the ecosystem and the origin of the Blue Lagoon hydrothermal fluid. A high ratio (63%) of analyzed taxa represented putative novel bacterial species. The majority (71%) of analyzed clones were Alphaproteobacteria, of which 80% belonged to the Roseobacter lineage within the family of Rhodobacteraceae. Of seven cultivated species, the two most abundant ones belonged to this lineage. Silicibacter lacuscaerulensis was confirmed as a dominating species in the Blue Lagoon. One group of isolates represented a recently identified species within the genus of Nitratireductor within Rhizobiales. This study implies an annually stable and seasonally dynamic ecosystem in the Blue Lagoon.

Distributions, seasonal variations, transformations and their influencing factors were discussed. Besides, burial fluxes of P in different seasons were also calculated. Five operationally defined forms of P, namely exchangeable or loosely sorbed P (Ads-P), iron-bound P (Fe-P), authigenic P (Au-P), detrital apatite plus other inorganic P (De-P) and organic P (OP), were obtained using a sequential extraction procedure. Generally, the concentrations of Ads-P, Fe-P, Au-P and OP decreased seaward and the concentrations of De-P increased seaward in both seasons. In spring, the average concentrations of Ads-P, Fe-P, Au-P, De-P and OP were 13.8 +/- 5.0, 21.9 +/- 7.6, 148.5 +/- 44.5, 153.1 +/- 55.8 and 91.7 +/- 21.5 mu g g(-1), respectively. The corresponding concentrations in autumn were 11.4 +/- 4.3, 20.0 +/- 10.9, 170.4 +/- 53.6, 225.6 +/- 101.7 and 77.1 +/- 319 mu g g(-1), respectively. The average percentages of P fractions in total P (TP) in spring and autumn were both in the order: De-P> Au-P> OP > Fe-P > Ads-P. The average concentrations of Bio-available P (Bio-P) were 127.4 +/- 31.4 mu g g(-1) in spring and 108.5 +/- 47.2 mu g g(-1) in autumn, accounting for 29.8% +/- 73% and 21.5% +/- 82% of corresponding TP, respectively. Seasonal variations of the primary production, hydrodynamic conditions, hypoxia and other environmental conditions were responsible for the seasonal variations of different phosphorus forms. The calculation of burial fluxes reflected that, in most parts of the studied area, TP had relative high burial fluxes in autumn, while Bio-P had relatively high burial fluxes in spring. The burial fluxes of other phosphorus forms also showed different seasonal variations in different parts of the studied area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In Southeastern South America, we characterized freshwater thermal regimes of 10 waterbodies located in the Queguay River Basin (Uruguay) over a period from 2019 to 2024. We characterized thermal regimes using 26 thermal metrics and applied Principal Component Analyses to evaluate the relative contribution of numeric metrics to variation among waterbody types (lakes, rivers, and streams), seasons, and ENSO phases. Mean daily water temperature, which represented a main component of variance, ranged from 6.4 degrees C to 30.2 degrees C, with summer water temperatures averaging 23.6 degrees C to 26.3 degrees C and winter temperatures averaging 11.1 degrees C to 13.5 degrees C among sites. Daily temperature range and standard deviation represented a secondary dimension of variance, such that streams and rivers displayed lower standard deviation in daily mean temperatures than lakes in Spring, Summer, and Fall. The El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation, associated with variation in flow regimes, influenced thermal regimes depending upon waterbody type and season. The El Ni & ntilde;o phase was associated with higher water temperatures in winter among all waterbody types, and the La Ni & ntilde;a phase was associated with higher daily temperature ranges in summer among rivers. Air temperature was a strong predictor of variation in water temperature, with model performance highest among streams. Variation in the flow of the Queguay River, ranging from 2 to 860 m3 s-1, influenced the sensitivity of water temperature to air temperature variability, whereby high-flow periods had lower sensitivity than low-flow periods. Overall, we characterize thermal regimes in an undammed system, showing how extreme climate and hydrological conditions influence thermal regimes. This study fills an important geographical gap in thermal regime data in freshwater ecosystems in South America and suggests that extreme hydroclimate events can have important implications for the thermal variability of freshwater systems.

J	Rolland, A; Bertrand, F; Maumy, M; Jacquet, S				Rolland, Anne; Bertrand, Frederic; Maumy, Myriam; Jacquet, Stephan			Assessing phytoplankton structure and spatio-temporal dynamics in a freshwater ecosystem using a powerful multiway statistical analysis	WATER RESEARCH												Phytoplankton dynamics and diversity are particularly difficult to analyze, especially when (i) the scale of the analysis is situated at the species level, (ii) such a diversity is high, (iii) the study covers several seasons, and (iv) sampling has been performed at many stations of the ecosystem. Fortunately, some powerful statistical methods have been developed with which each species identified can be considered in detailed spatio-temporal analyses. The Partial Triadic Analysis, a method issued from the STATIS family, was applied on a dataset corresponding to 6 stations of the largest French reservoir (Reservoir Marne) sampled 22 times over two years (2006-2007) between March and September. Three key sampling periods that were consistent with those exhibited with the Plankton Ecology Group model (i.e. early spring, late spring-early summer, late summer-early autumn) were unambiguously recognized, with some specific species associated with each of them. Furthermore, a potential reference sampling station was identified among all stations investigated, an information very relevant to both scientists and water managers. It remains that 3 other stations could also be monitored, regularly or from time to time, because of specific phytoplankton characteristics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that high P and N input deteriorated the water quality, and P primarily limited Chlorophyll a concentrations. Diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria were the dominant phyla, totaling 29 and 41 species in summer and winter, respectively. Total P negatively affected the phytoplankton diversity during summer and had a stronger positive relationship with richness than total N during winter. The P level restricted the biomass of dominant algae, and turbidity had a greater interaction with cyanobacteria. This study suggests that P drives the phytoplankton assemblages under N-rich environments in the inflow rivers during summer and winter, indicating the need for nutrient reduction and further monitoring of the rivers to improve the water ecology.

J	Mascitti, V; Bonaventura, SM				Mascitti, V; Bonaventura, SM			Patterns of abundance, distribution and habitat use of flamingos in the high Andes, South America	WATERBIRDS												Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), Andean Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and James' Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi) occur in the high Andes water bodies of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. The objectives of this study were to analyze seasonal variations in flamingo abundance and movements related to climatic conditions, and to identify the physical characteristics of water bodies determining the seasonal distribution and abundance. Flamingo numbers reached a peak in summer and diminished in winter. Within the high Andes region, the Andean Flamingo was mainly found in the Dry and Dry-cold climatic sub-regions during summer. This species moved into the Dry sub-region in winter. In summerjames' Flamingo primarily occurred in water bodies of the Dry-cold sub-region. During winter, some individuals remained in the Dry-cold sub-region, and others moved to the Wet, Dry and Desert sub-regions. In summer, Chilean Flamingo occurred principally in the Dry sub-region. In winter, few remained in the Dry sub-region, and most birds moved to the Wet sub-region. These seasonal changes in flamingo numbers within the high Andes show that in winter, these birds move from sub-regions with extreme climatic conditions (Desert and Dry-cold sub-regions) to those with more suitable conditions (Wet and Dry sub-regions). The seasonal fluctuation in abundance might be explained by intra- and inter-regional movements in response to adverse climatic conditions. The relationships between water body physical characteristics and flamingo species show that the Chilean Flamingo mainly used lakes, both in summer and winter. James' Flamingo usually used saline playa-lakes at high altitudes in summer and winter. Andean Flamingo selected salt-flats during summer and lakes in winter. It is suggested that Chilean and James' Flamingos are habitat-specialists and the Andean Flamingo is a habitat-generalist.																			1524-4695					SEP	2002	25	3					358	365		10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0358:POADAH]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0358:POADAH]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177616500011

Gloria; Maberly, Stephen C.			Effects of brownification and warming on algal blooms, metabolism and higher trophic levels in productive shallow lake mesocosms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												An increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland waters has been reported across the northern temperate region but the effects of this on whole lake ecosystems, often combined with other anthropogenic stressors like nutrient inputs and warming, are poorly known. The effects of these changes on different component of the ecosystem were assessed in an experiment using twenty-four large (30001) outdoor mesocosms simulating shallow lakes. Two different temperature regimes (ambient and ambient +4 degrees C) combined with three levels of organic matter (OM, added as filtered peaty water), simulating the DOC increase that is predicted to take place over the next 4 to 21 years were used. Neither temperature nor OM had significant effects on net ecosystem production, respiration or gross primary production. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration was not significantly affected by warming, however in summer, autumn and winter it was significantly higher in mesocosms receiving intermediate OM levels (July-Feb DOC concentrations 2-6 mg L-1). Summer cyanobacterial blooms were highest in intermediate, and lowest in the highest OM treatments. OM concentration also influenced total macroinvertebrate abundance which was greater in spring and summer in mesocosms with intermediate and high OM. Fish abundance was not significantly affected by OM concentration, but abundance was greater in ambient (55 fish subsample(-1)) compared to heated mesocosms (17 fish subsample(-1)) and maximum abundance occurred two weeks later compared to heated mesocosms. The results suggest that changes in OM may have a greater effect on shallow lakes than temperature and that phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria. benefit from intermediate OM concentrations, therefore, nuisance algal blooms might increase in relatively clear shallow eutrophic lakes where DOC concentrations increase.

J	Shuman, B; Donnelly, JP				Shuman, B; Donnelly, JP			The influence of seasonal precipitation and temperature regimes on lake levels in the northeastern United States during the Holocene	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												AMS-dated sediment cores combined with ground-penetrating radar profiles from two lakes in southeastern Massachusetts demonstrate that regional water levels rose and fell multiple times during the Holocene when the known climatic controls (i.e., ice extent and insolation) underwent unidirectional changes. The lakes were lowest between 10,000 and 9000 and between 5500 and 3000 cat yr B.P. Using a heuristic moisture-budget model, we explore the hypothesis that changes in seasonal precipitation regimes, driven by monotonic trends in ice extent and insolation, plausibly explain the multiple lake-level changes. Simulated lake levels resulting from low summer precipitation rates match observed low lake levels of 10,000-9000 cat yr B.P., whereas a model experiment that simply shifts the seasonality of the modem Massachusetts precipitation regime (i.e., moving the peak monthly precipitation from winter to summer) produces levels that are similar to 2 in lower than today as observed for 5500-3000 cat yr BY, The influence of the Laurentide ice sheet could explain dry summers before ca. 8000 cat yr B.P. A later shift from a summer-wet to a winter-wet moisture-balance regime could have resulted from insolation-driven changes in the influence of the Bermuda subtropical high. Temperature changes probably further modified lake levels by affecting snowmelt and transpiration. (c) 2005 Published by University of Washington.

J	Hochstädter, S				Hochstädter, S			Seasonal changes of C:P ratios of seston, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton in a deep, mesotrophic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The C:P ratios of seston, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton were measured twice a week in situ in mesotrophic, large and deep Lake Constance from April to December 1995. Except for zooplankton, a strong seasonality was exhibited with low C:P ratios during P-enriched early spring conditions and high values during P-depleted summer conditions. 2. Molar C:P ratios of seston varied between 180:1 and 460:1 demonstrating moderate phosphorus limitation in spring and during the clear-water phase, and strong limitation for the rest of the season. The sestonic C:P ratio increased significantly during two decades of re-oligotrophication of Lake Constance, reflecting an enhanced phosphorus limitation of the plankton community in summer. Molar C:P ratios of bacteria and phytoplankton varied seasonally between 50:1 and 130:1 and 180:1 and 500:1, respectively, and indicate carbon or light limitation in winter and phosphorus limitation in summer. Zooplankton had a molar C:P ratio of about 124:115 which was nearly constant throughout the seasons. 3. These differences in the C:P ratios of planktonic organisms have direct implications for phosphorus recycling within the food web as C:P ratios of excreta should be highly variable.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2000	44	3					453	463		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00597.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00597.x													WOS:000088556500008

John; Ji, Junfeng			Diatom seasonality and sedimentation in a subtropical alpine lake (Lugu Hu, Yunnan-Sichuan, Southwest China)	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The diatom succession and sedimentation during 2011 in a subtropical, deep alpine lake (Lugu Hu, Southwest China) were studied. The seasonal patterns in diatom assemblages were related to light, nutrient availability, and thermal regime. Peaks in the concentration of the planktonic diatoms (Asterionella formosa and Cyclotella ocellata) occurred in the metalimnion during autumn when light penetration was greater and silica concentrations were higher. The spring peak of Cyclostephanos dubius appeared to be a result of the combination of a well-mixed water column, higher nutrient concentration, and low light availability. Its sedimentation in late spring suggests that the sinking rates of C. dubius increased rapidly with the onset of stratification. However, the minimal catches of A. formosa and C. ocellata in sediment traps during autumn suggest they were still actively growing with very low sedimentation losses. The catch of benthic Fragilaria species in sediment traps during early spring and autumn reflected their resuspension from shallow water and transfer into pelagic zone as thermal stratification breaks down. The results provide important information for the interpretation of paleolimnological records from the lakes in Southwest China.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2015	47	3					461	472		10.1657/AAAR0014-039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/AAAR0014-039													WOS:000359679000004

An examination of the efficacy of the qualitative ranking systems (Functional Capacity Index) was performed for the maintenance of static and dynamic surface water storage in prairie pothole wetlands. Wetland PI in the Cottonwood Lake area in North Dakota, was selected for this analysis due to the wealth of hydrologic data available. A calibration procedure was performed to provide a general agreement between the observed and simulated wetland stage. The model was then used to assess the relative amounts of the surface versus groundwater flow to wetland pi. This analysis indicates that surface water flow provides short-duration, large-magnitude flows, typically associated with spring thaws. The groundwater flux is of smaller magnitude and longer duration, with typical patterns of inflow in the spring and late fall and early winter and outflow occurring in late winter, early spring, and in the summer months. The numerical assessment of the scoring algorithms for the maintenance of the static and dynamic surface water storage functional capacity indices indicates that some of the variables are being properly scored, while others are not. Specifically, an excellent agreement was found between the static and dynamic Functional Capacity Index (FCI) scores for the V-source variable and the static FCI for the V-subout variable. A poor agreement was found for the static and dynamic FCIs for the V-out, V-pore, and V-upuse, variables. The dynamic surface storage FCI did not include the V-subout variable, yet a strong dependence was found in this FCI. Based on the results of this study, it can be seen that there is a need to improve the scoring algorithms for determining the HGM indices relative to static and dynamic functioning of the wetlands.

In order to reveal the recharge mechanisms among different water bodies in arid areas, precipitation, surface water, and groundwater were sampled in the Ebinur Lake basin, Xinjiang, China, and the isotopic values for hydrogen and oxygen were measured. The stable isotope values of precipitation showed significant seasonal variation, with minimum values in the winter, medium values in the spring and autumn, and maximum values in the summer. The slope and intercept of local meteoric water line were both lower than that of global meteoric water line, indicating subcloud evaporation effect. The vapor source of precipitation was dominated by the westerlies, but the regional re-evaporation vapor accounted for some proportions as well. In the Bortala River and Jinghe River, the stable isotopic values varied spatially, tending to be enriched with the river flow. The stable isotopic values for lake water were significantly higher than those of river water, which reflected a stronger evaporation and concentration effect of the lake water. The stable isotopic values of groundwater featured similar spatial variation compared to the river, and phreatic water evaporated to some extent. In the Bortala River, owing to its specific hydrogeological structure, the exchange rates between the groundwater and the river water were higher upstream than in the middle and lower reaches. In the Jinghe River, the deep groundwater aquifer received recharge from the shallow groundwater layers and from the river. At the edge of the Ebinur Lake, the interaction of groundwater and surface water was low and springs became the important recharge source for the lake. The results of this study provide insights into the determination of river hydrological processes and the management of water resources.

Selenium Concentrations in Greater Scaup and Dreissenid Mussels During Winter on Western Lake Ontario	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												One hypothesis for the decline of the North American greater (Aythya marila) and lesser (A. affinis) scaup population is that contaminant burdens acquired on wintering or staging areas impair reproduction or cause lethal or sublethal health effects. Recent studies have found increased selenium (Se) concentrations in scaup but have focused on the fall and spring staging periods. From January to March 2006 and December to March 2006 and 2007, we analyzed liver tissues collected from greater scaup wintering in western Lake Ontario for 16 trace elements. We also measured Se concentrations in greater scaup blood and Dreissenid mussel tissue. Se was the only trace element that occurred at increased concentrations (> 10 mu g/g liver dry weight) in a substantial proportion (99%) of greater scaup livers. We also found that hepatic Se concentrations increased throughout winter and were increased in nearly all birds from January to March, suggesting that accumulation of this trace element occurred soon after their arrival in fall. Se concentrations were similar in male and female birds, but juvenile birds had higher concentrations than did adults. Blood Se concentrations were correlated to liver Se concentrations in 2006 only, suggesting that blood Se concentration is an unreliable predictor of liver concentration. Se in Dreissenid mussels generally decreased with mussel size and did not change throughout winter. Overall, our results suggest that greater scaup wintering on western Lake Ontario acquire sufficiently high Se concentrations to potentially impact their health. Thus, several indicators of health and survival should be examined in relation to Se concentrations in wintering scaup.

Then and now: Revisiting nutrient export in agricultural watersheds within southern Ontario's lower Great Lakes basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An enhanced understanding of nonpoint source (NPS) nutrient export to the lower Great Lakes is needed to inform land use and land management decisions within southern Ontario. However, this understanding is limited by a lack of long-term, temporally-intensive monitoring. To address this knowledge gap, we revisit six agriculturally-dominated subwatersheds in southern Ontario, which were intensively studied during the mid-1970s, to assess changes in hydrology and NPS nutrient contributions. We compared 1975-1977 to 2016-2018 stream runoff, nutrient export (kg/day center dot km2), and flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMCs) of total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrates (NO3-+NO2-) and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). Relative to the 1970s, runoff increased at three of six watersheds (by -20-35%) while TP and TDP export increased at five watersheds (by -50-125%). The increases in TP and TDP FWMCs were lower relative to phosphorus export changes at the three watersheds with increased runoff, suggesting that hydrology is an important driver of phosphorus export at these sites. Interestingly, export of TN and nitrates increased while TKN export decreased at most watersheds. We further note a shift in the timing of nutrient export at most sites, with -40-70% of export now occurring during the winter and fall seasons whereas -40-85% of past export occurred during spring and summer. These findings support an enhanced importance of non-growing season nutrient export from agricultural watersheds since the mid-1970s and stresses the need for targeted best management practices specific to the fall and winter seasons.

Decomposition was measured with litter bags using a factorial design. Our plant species were Decodon verticillatus (L.) ELL. (an emergent shrub) and Ceratophyllum demersum L. (a submerged macrophyte). Decomposition rate was expressed as change in carbon, calculated as percent of ash free dry weight remaining over time. Decay coefficients (k, where e-k = wt/Wo et) for year 1 (259 days) were 0.64 and 0.074, respectively for Decodon and Ceratophyllum, and for year 2 (205 days) 0.055 and 0.072 in fine mesh bags (1 mm mesh). For year 1 decay coefficients in coarse mesh bags (5 mm mesh) were 0.070 and 0.094 for Decodon and Ceratophyllum, respectively; and for year 2, 0.059 and 0.041 (based on a log-log model). Rapid initial decay of aquatic material suggests that detritivores may rely on in-lake sources in summer and autumn, and on riparian-allochthonous materials in winter and spring.																			0003-9136					JAN	1988	111	3					383	396																WOS:A1988M232500006
J	Karchesky, CM; Bennett, DH				Karchesky, CM; Bennett, DH			Winter habitat use by adult largemouth bass in the Pend Oreille River, Idaho	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the behavior and use of overwintering habitat of adult largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in the Pend Oreille River, Idaho, using radiotelemetry after increases in winter water levels. Largemouth bass tagged in late summer remained in backwaters until the initiation of the fall drawdown, when they moved to deeper shoreline areas. As water temperatures declined further, all but 1 of the 19 largemouth bass tagged throughout a 44.2-km-long section of river migrated to one of two overwintering areas. Once there, largemouth bass either showed no movement or migrated freely between the two overwintering areas. The overwintering areas were adjacent to the river, had an abundance of aquatic macrophytes, were more than 1 m deep, and had zero water velocity. Higher winter lake levels of 0.6 m did not attract wintering largemouth bass to backwaters. We hypothesized that habitat in overwintering areas was preferred because water temperatures there were several degrees warmer than in shallow backwaters.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2004	24	2					577	585		10.1577/M02-175.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M02-175.1													WOS:000222067500021

Previous studies on e-flow assessment for lake-marsh systems focused on lake-marsh systems with natural seasonal hydrological patterns (i.e., low water level in winter and high water level in summer). However, they have not considered lake-marsh systems with reverse seasonal hydrological patterns (i.e., high water level in winter and low water level in summer). The reverse seasonal hydrological patterns impose seriously negative impacts on waterbirds, because the hydrological patterns could lead to limited plant germination in spring and massive plant death in summer, leaving few plants available as food for waterbirds in winter, and could consequently reduce the sheltering and forageable areas for waterbirds. This study took Hongze Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve in China as the study area. Based on the habitat requirements of waterbirds, the sheltering and forageable areas for waterbirds under different water-depth and aquatic plant distribution scenarios were calculated. By exploring the impacts of reverse seasonal hydrological processes on waterbird habitats, we determined the necessary e-flows for lake-marsh systems with reverse seasonal hydrological patterns to meet the needs of waterbird habitat. The results showed that the water level of Hongze Lake should be controlled to 13.0-13.1 m in March, 12.5-12.6 m in July, and 12.9-13.0 m in October, which can meet the needs of waterbirds for both shelter and foraging.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				MAY	2021	35	5							e14224	10.1002/hyp.14224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14224													WOS:000655496700040
J	Mamun, M; An, KG				Mamun, Md; An, Kwang-Guk			Development of Reservoir Water Quality Index (WQI) Based on Long-term Physicochemical Parameters and Their Spatio-temporal Variations	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												The main objectives of this study were to develop a Water Quality Index (WQI) model based on the physicochemical parameters in Daecheong reservoirs by using datasets of 1995-2016. The parameters included total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), chlorophyll (CHL), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and hydrogen ion concentrations (pH). The results had showed that physicochemical parameters varied spatially and temporarily as well as were correlated. TP was the most important key regulating factor for chlorophyll growth in the reservoirs. Seasonal summer TP influenced the autumn algal growth. The concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) was highest during the summer season (36 +/- 2 mu gL(-1)) while it was lowest in the winter season (15 +/- 1 mu gL(-1)). Summer monsoon directly influences the concentrations of total phosphorus in the reservoirs. Overall, the calculated WQI value suggested that site 1 (129.44) was in poor condition whereas sites 2 (116.06), 3 (103.51), 4 (89.3), 5 (82.007) and 6 (90.22) were in fair condition.

J	Szabó, J				Szabo, J.			The relationship between landslide activity and weather: examples from Hungary	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The paper presents the impact of irregular rainfall events triggering landslides in the regional context of landslides in Hungary. The author's experience, gathered from decades of observations, confirms that landslide processes are strongly correlate with precipitation events in all three landscape types (hill regions of unconsolidated sediments; high bluffs along river banks and lake shores; mountains of Tertiary stratovolcanoes). Case studies for each landscape type underline that new landslides are triggered and old ones are reactivated by extreme winter precipitation events. This assertion is valid mainly for shallow and translational slides. Wet autumns favour landsliding, while the triggering influence of intense summer rainfalls is of a subordinate nature. A recent increasing problem lies in the fact that on previously unstable slopes, stabilised during longer dry intervals, an intensive cultivation starts, thus increasing the damage caused by movements during relatively infrequent wet winters.																			1561-8633						2003	3	1-2			SI		43	52		10.5194/nhess-3-43-2003	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-3-43-2003													WOS:000208897400004

Incorporating rain-on-snow into the SWAT model results in more accurate simulations of hydrologic extremes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In many cold climates, rain-on-snow (ROS) events are associated with severe snowmelt and flooding. ROS events also rapidly deplete snowpacks, reducing the potential for subsurface water storage later in the year. We incorporated a simple, easily transferable energy-balance ROS model into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to assess how ROS melt affects winter floods and summer hydrological drought over a large area such as the North American Great Lakes Basin, where ROS is associated with severe snowmelt events. Using 504 random parameter sets, the modification consistently improved simulations and led to higher winter flows and lower summer flows compared with the unmodified SWAT. The SWAT ROS model also had improved performance for simulating daily streamflow in 501 (99.4%) of the 504 random parameter sets and improved performance for simulating daily snowpack in 504 (100%) of the sets, compared to the unmodified SWAT. We then used streamflow and snow water equivalent as the objectives in a multivariable, multi-site calibration to compare SWAT ROS with the unmodified SWAT. The SWAT ROS model simulated 51% larger peak (0.95 quantile) daily flows during winter and spring and 58% lower daily summer low (0.05 quantile) flows across the Great Lakes Basin, compared to the unmodified SWAT. We also used observed snowpack data to demonstrate how the unmodified SWAT can miss daily ROS melt events, delaying snowmelt to later in the season. Thus, the unmodified SWAT model appears to be misrepresenting the streamflow distribution in areas where ROS events occur, which is particularly important for modeling extreme events. When simulating conditions in cold climates at diverse scales up to large basins or continents, hydrological models such as SWAT must incorporate ROS, as many other models already do. This has implications for water resources management confronted with hydrological extremes in ROS-prone areas around the world, especially where climate change is altering ROS melt events.					; Ficklin, Darren/C-3082-2013; Myers, Daniel/O-6516-2018; Robeson, Scott/A-9895-2008	Ficklin, Darren/0000-0003-3736-7407; Myers, Daniel/0000-0002-1932-5775; Robeson, Scott/0000-0002-1558-6951; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2021	603		B						126972	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126972		SEP 2021											WOS:000706318300047

Comparative population dynamics of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) populations in two similar closely adjacent warm-water Texas reservoirs	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha) ) population dynamics were recorded between 2 September 2019 and 26 September 2020 at marina sites in each of two adjacent central Texas water bodies, Belton (BL) and Stillhouse Hollow (SHL) Lakes infested in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Lake water temperatures were insignificantly different while dissolved oxygen, pH and Secchi Disk depths were slightly higher in SHL. Veliger densities in both populations peaked in late Fall 2019 with veligers becoming absent by January 2020. Veliger densities again peaked in May-August 2020. These fall and spring spawning periods resulted in the presence of fall and spring mussel settlement cohorts. Mussel densities on settlement plates were greater at SHL than BL. At both sites, Fall 2019 cohorts had a lifespan of approximately one year or less, experiencing mass mortality during peak water temperatures in late summer/early fall the year after initial cohort settlement. Shell growth rates of the Spring 2020 BL and SHL cohorts were 91.4 and 67.3 mu m/day, over a 126 day growing period, respectively, falling within the range reported for mussel populations in other southwestern US water bodies. Rapid shell growth and maturation allowed initiation of spawning earlier than zebra mussel populations in cooler, higher latitudes. Rapid growth and early maturity allows southwestern US zebra mussel populations to rapidly attain peak densities after infestation followed by population declines as recorded in BL. That southwestern mussel populations rapidly attain post invasion peak densities allows little time for water using facilities to develop effective, environmentally acceptable means of protecting infrastructure from mussel fouling. Thus, plans to prevent/minimize mussel fouling should be made in advance of invasion. Similarly, water body managers should develop and implement plans to minimize invasion likelihood and for rapid response before invasion occurs.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2024	19	3					309	328		10.3391/ai.2024.19.3.131793	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2024.19.3.131793													WOS:001324941300004

Lateral dimensions in riverine function substantially influence backwater ecology; however, backwater communities are highly dynamic and infrequently investigated due to logistical difficulties. We created seasonal food webs for an upper Missouri River backwater using a combined food habits and stable isotope analysis. Temporal transition of energy origins was apparent. In the spring, carbon primarily originated from sediments, detritus and periphyton. During mid-summer, carbon was derived from a variety of sources, but included large proportions of terrestrial plants and particulate organic matter. By early fall, the backwater was uncoupled from the river, and autochthonous phytoplankton appeared to be the dominant carbon source. During all sample periods, Chironomidae was an important trophic link conveying energy from the primary producers to the higher consumers. Additionally, zooplankton were an important energy transfer taxa to the abundant age-0 fish community in the fall, and Corixidae were important in the spring.

J	Kogovsek, J; Petric, M				Kogovsek, Janja; Petric, Metka			Water temperature as a natural tracer - a case study of the Malenscica karst spring (SW Slovenia)	GEOLOGIA CROATICA												For the adequate protection of karst springs it is important to understand the functioning of karst systems in their recharge areas. Besides tracer tests with artificial tracers, tracings with natural tracers, such as temperature, are a very useful research tool, especially in complex karst systems with various types and sources of recharge. Detailed monitoring of water levels and temperatures of the Malenscica karst spring, as well as of the intermittent Cerknica Lake and Kotlici spring in its recharge area, indicated that temperature is a good tracer in winter and summer periods, especially when the Cerknica karst polje is flooded. High or low air temperatures influence the temperature of water, which sinks at the Cerknica polje and flows rapidly through karst channels toward the springs. Detailed analysis of selected events enabled calculation of the velocity of groundwater flow toward the Malenscica spring under different hydrological conditions. The estimated values are in accordance with the velocities previously defined in this area, based on several tracer tests with artificial tracers. From the results, it is possible to assess the transport velocities of contaminants under different hydrological conditions. This is important information for the protection of the Malenscica spring, which is captured for the public water supply.

The aim of the study was to determine the seasonal variability of the concentrations of nitrogen mineral compounds (N-NO(2) N-NO(3) and N-NH(4)) in groundwater under extensively managed peat-muck soils, situated in Wrocikowo in the Olsztyn Lakeland and in the Dymerskie Meadows in the Mragowo Lakeland. Peat-muck soil, found at the study sites, had varied physical properties. The highest content of mineral particles (69.3%) in the muck layer was found in soil marked as MtI 120gy under turf-covered wasteland, and in the peat layer (51.5%) - in soil marked as MtII 60gy under extensively managed meadow. Groundwater taken from piezometers installed in hydrogenic soils was used as the study material. Water for chemical determinations was taken during four seasons: spring - in May, summer - in August, autumn - in November and winter - in January. The concentration of mineral forms of nitrogen in groundwater of peat-muck soil was found to depend on its type, the depth where the groundwater was found and the type of soil use. The highest concentration of mineral nitrogen was found in summer (1.62 mg dm(-3) on average), and the lowest (1.11 mg dm(-3) on average) was found in winter. The concentration of mineral nitrogen in groundwater of extensively managed peat-muck soil ranged from 0.81 to 2.27 mg dm(-3) and was found to be dependent on the type of soil rather than its use. Lowering the level of groundwater in peat-muck soil increases the concentration of mineral forms of nitrogen, especially N-NH(4). Ammonium nitrogen was the dominant form of nitrogen in the groundwater of peat-muck soil (MtII 60gy and MtI 120gy) of non-managed and extensively managed meadows, whereas nitrate nitrogen was the dominant form of the element in the MtIc 35gy soil under the meadow and the MtII bb under the pasture.

The parasite has an annual cycle in which worms overwinter as inactive adults. In spring, they lay eggs and many worms die. A short generation time (14 days at 20.degree. C) allows transmission throughout summer and well into fall. Perch acquire infections during the first few months of life and thereafter annually lose and reacquire infections. The intensity of U. adspectus peaks during July and generally increases with age of the host. Length-frequency distributions of parasites on 4 host age-classes (1,2 3-4, and 5 and older) indicate that they grow larger on larger hosts. Seasonal monitoring of length-frequency distributions revealed that spring growth of overwintering worms and onset of spring invasion commence earlier on mature perch than on immature perch. The results are discussed in relation to our understanding of fish parasite populations in small lakes.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	2					272	277		10.1139/z85-042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-042													WOS:A1985AES2700010
J	Ke, LH; Song, CQ				Ke Linghong; Song Chunqiao			Remotely sensed surface temperature variation of an inland saline lake over the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Research on surface water temperature (SWT) variations in large lakes over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has been limited by lack of in situ measurements. By taking advantage of the increased availability of remotely sensed observations, this study investigated SWT variation of Siling Co in central QTP by processing complete MODIS Land surface temperature (LST) images over the lake covering from 2001 to 2013. The temporal (diurnal, intra-annul and inter-annul) variations of Siling Co SWT as well as the spatial patterns were analyzed. The results show that on average from late December to mid-April the lake is in a mixing state of water and ice and drastic diurnal temperature differences occur, especially along the shallow shoreline areas. The extent of spatial variations in monthly SWT ranges from 1.25 degrees C to 3.5 degrees C, and particularly large at nighttime and in winter months. The spatial patterns of annual average SWT were likely impacted by the cooling effect of river inflow from the west and east side of the lake. The annual cycle of spatial pattern of SWT is characterized by seasonal reversions between the shallow littoral regions and deep parts due to different heat capacity. Compared to the deep regions, the littoral shallow shoreline areas warms up quickly in spring and summer, and cool down drastically in autumn and winter, showing large diurnal and seasonal variation amplitudes of SWT. Two cold belt zones in the western and eastern side of the lake and warm patches along the southwestern and northeastern shorelines are shaped by the combined effects of the lakebed topography and river runoff. Overall, the lake-averaged SVVT increased at a rate of 0.26 degrees C/decade during 2001-2013. Faster increase of temperature was found at nighttime (0.34 degrees C/decade) and in winter and spring, consistent with the asymmetric warming pattern over land areas reported in prior studies. The rate of temperature increase over Siling Co is remarkably lower than that over Bangoin station, which is probably attributable to the large heat capacity of water and partly reflects the sensitive of alpine saltwater lake to climate change.

J	Liboriussen, L; Jeppesen, E				Liboriussen, Lone; Jeppesen, Erik			Periphyton biomass, potential production and respiration in a shallow lake during winter and spring	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Abundance, depth distribution, potential productivity and respiration of periphyton on short-time (1 month) and long-time incubated strips were followed monthly during the winter-spring (January-May) transition in a shallow eutrophic lake. A taxonomic shift occurred from dominance of diatoms under ice to chlorophyte dominance in spring communities on the long-time incubated strips, while diatoms dominated until May on the short-time incubated strips. Periphyton biomass accrual was low during the ice-covered winter months (November-January: 4 mg chl a m(-2) month(-1)), but increased to a maximum of 112 mg chl a m(-2) month(-1) immediately after ice-out in February. During February-April, the biomass remained constant before declining in May. Periphyton on long-time incubated strips was equally distributed in the water column in winter (January-February), but was higher near the water surface in spring (March-May). Periphyton did not change with depth on the short-time incubated strips. The potential production to respiration ratio (P/R) was negatively correlated with periphyton biomass. Throughout the study, P/R was <1 for the short-time incubated periphyton, while this was only the case in March-April for the long-time incubations. This study showed a high productive capacity of winter periphyton, resulting in accumulation of a relatively high periphytic biomass early in the season. A massive periphyton density in eutrophic lakes already in winter-spring may potentially delay or prevent the establishment and re-occurrence of submerged macrophytes in the early oligotrophication phase following a reduction of the external nutrient loading.

However, the long-term trends in LSWT across China and their driving factors remain uncertain. Here, we used a calibrated lake model to simulate LSWT over 1979-2018 for 91 large lakes (>100 km(2)) across China. Simulations reveal an overall LSWT warming trend (0.040 degrees C yr(-1), p < 0.05), but with large spatial variations. The majority of these lakes show significant warming trends (84%, 0.053 degrees C yr(-1)), while a significant cooling trend is found in the seven lakes in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau (-0.064 degrees C yr(-1)). LSWT of approximately 42% of the lakes increases more rapidly than the corresponding ambient air temperature. Regionally, the warming trend is highest for lakes in the Eastern Plain (0.049 degrees C yr(-1)) and the lowest in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (0.016 degrees C yr(-1)). The increases in simulated LSWT also vary across seasons, with a higher rate in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. Changes in air temperature, downward longwave radiation, and wind speed are the most important climatic drivers for LSWT changes. Lake surface warming could be more rapid under future global warming, necessitating greater attention to lake-atmosphere interactions.

However, LCAs in saline lakes are often produced by multiple haptophyte species, which may confound data interpretations. Here we analyzed LCAs in a finely laminated, high sedimentation rate core from the hypersaline Lake Gahai in the northern Qinghai Tibetan Plateau and compared our results with regional instrumental records. We find that LCA unsaturation ratios display a stepwise jump during the instrumental period, most likely originating from a sudden shift in the dominant alkenone producers. In contrast, the percentage of the C-37:4 alkenone (% C-37:4) displays strong correlations with spring and combined winter-spring precipitation amount (R-2 = 0.83 and R-2 = 0.81, respectively). We hypothesize that high winter-spring precipitation leads to greater freshening of lake surface water immediately after spring melting, promoting greater production of LCAs with relatively high %C-37:4 values by the early blooming haptophyte species. Extending the instrumental calibration downcore allows us to quantitatively reconstruct regional spring and winter spring precipitation for the past millennium. We find a major increase in winter-spring precipitation during the Little Ice Age (LIA), especially during the phases of solar minima. Our finding provides novel quantitative support to the previous studies suggesting relatively wet conditions during the LIA in the westerly dominated regions of central Asia and northern Tibetan Plateau and infers a substantial increase in regional winter-spring precipitation should the predicted grand solar minimum in the forthcoming decades become a reality.

With stratification, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total filtered phosphorus, SRS, and nitrate-plus-nitrite were depleted in the epilimnion due to phytoplankton uptake. Total unfiltered phosphorus (TP) and ammonia (NH3) exhibited higher epilimnetic concentratons, the former being attributed to tributary inputs which were maintained throughout the stratified period, even though inputs from Niagara River served to dilute the epilimnion. Increased levels of TP, SRP, and SRS were also evident within the nepheloid layer. Horizontal distributions of TP and NH3 were governed by point-source inputs throughout the study period. Distributions of the soluble nutrients were governed by phytoplankton uptake in the spring, point/nonpoint inputs and upwelling in the summer, and differential breakdown of stratification in the fall. Spring distribution of particulate organic matter (POM) was strongly related to nutrient availability and water columns stability, while phytoplankton species composition determined fall POM distribution. Significantly higher (p < 0.05) POM levels, detrital content, and productivity were observed nearshore of the thermal bar.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1987	44	12					2192	2203		10.1139/f87-269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-269													WOS:A1987M856600017
J	Bégin, Y				Bégin, Y			Tree-ring dating of extreme lake levels at the subarctic-boreal interface	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The dates of extreme water levels of two large lakes in northern Quebec have been recorded over the last century by ice scars on shoreline trees and sequences of reaction wood in shore trees tilted by wave erosion. Ice-scar chronologies indicate high water levels in spring, whereas tree-tilting by waves is caused by summer high waters. A major increase in both the amplitude and frequency of ice floods occurred in the 1930s. No such change was indicated by the tree-tilting chronologies, but wave erosion occurred in exceptionally rainy years. According to the modern record, spring lake-level rise is due to increased snowfalls since the 1930s. However, the absence of erosional marks in a large number of years since 1930 suggests a high frequency of low-water-level years resulting from dry conditions. Intercalary years with very large numbers of marked trees (e.g., 1935) indicate that the interannual range of summer lake levels has increased since the 1930s. Increased lake-flood frequency is postulated to be related to a slower expansion of arctic anticyclones, favoring the passage of cyclonic air masses over the area and resulting in abundant snowfall in early winter. Conditions in summer are due to the rate of weakening of the anticyclones controlling the position of the arctic front in summer. This position influences the path of the cyclonic air masses, which control summer precipitation and, consequently, summer lake levels in the area.

A selection of long-term discharge records including both unregulated and regulated rivers and lake outlets were analysed up to the year 2004. In addition to individual time series, monthly and annual discharges from the territory of Finland were calculated for the period 1912-2004. The observed drought and flood periods are also discussed, as well as the connection between discharge regime and climate. Moreover, the periodicity of the time series is examined for a couple of sites. The Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to assess changes in annual, monthly and seasonal mean discharges, maximum and minimum flows and, in addition, the date of the annual peak flow. The trend analysis revealed no changes in mean annual flow in general, but the seasonal distribution of streamflow has changed. Winter and spring mean monthly discharges have increased at most of the observation sites. The spring peak has moved to an earlier date at over one-third of the sites. However, the magnitudes of spring high flow have not changed. Autumn flow did not show trends in general. Minimum flows have increased at about half of the unregulated sites.																			0029-1277	2224-7955					2010	41	3-4					253	268		10.2166/nh.2010.112	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2010.112													WOS:000279499700008

The results demonstrated that white-naped cranes migrated an average of 2556 km (& PLUSMN;187.9 SD) in autumn and 2673 km (& PLUSMN;342.3) in spring. We identified 86 critical stopover sites that supported individuals for more than 14 days, within a 100-800 km wide migratory corridor. This study also confirmed that Luan River catchment is the most important staging region, where white-naped cranes spent 18% of the annual cycle (in both spring and autumn) each year. Throughout the annual cycle, 69% of the tracking locations were from outside of the currently protected areas, while none of the critical staging areas enjoyed any form of site protection.

Systematic chemical measurements were performed at eleven cross-sections located along Czerniakowskie Lake, the largest lake in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. During the summer, the lake is used as a public bathing area, therefore, to better evaluate human impacts, field measurements were carried out in high-use seasons. It was found that the spatial distributions of aqueous lead and zinc differ during the summer and autumn. In summer several Pb and Zn hot-spots were observed, while during autumn spatial distributions of Pb and Zn were rather homogenous throughout the entire lake. Large seasonal differences in spatial distributions of Pb and Zn were found in bottom sediments. Autumn concentrations of both heavy metals were ten times higher in comparison with summer values. Clear cross-correlations of Pb and Zn concentrations in water, suspension and bottom sediments suggest that both Pb and Zn came to Czerniakowskie Lake from the same source.

J	GABOURY, MN; PATALAS, JW				GABOURY, MN; PATALAS, JW			INFLUENCE OF WATER LEVEL DRAWDOWN ON THE FISH POPULATIONS OF CROSS LAKE, MANITOBA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Regulated discharges into Cross Lake, Manitoba, resulted in average summer water volumes in 1980 and 1981 that were 49% lower than preregulated volumes. Water level drawdown in the summer reudces the amount of available habitat. Consequently, the standing crops of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum), northern pike (Esox lucius) and cisco (C. artedii) are lower now than in preregulation and early postregulation years. Unusually early and rapid drawdown in March 1981 resulted in a severe winterkill, causing a substantial decrease in catches per unit of effort (CPUE) for most species from 1980-1981. The most affected species were whitefish and cisco, which showed a 50% reduction in CPUE from 1980-1981. The amount of fall to late spring drawdown and the year-class strengths of coregonid fishes were inversely related. A marked overwinter drawdown reduces whitefish and cisco hatching success apparently by dewatering their spawning areas and desiccating the eggs. Low water levels in spring prevented pike and walleye access to spawning areas.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	1					118	125		10.1139/f84-011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-011													WOS:A1984SJ22100011
J	Sutton, TM; Ney, JJ				Sutton, TM; Ney, JJ			Size-dependent mechanisms influencing first-year growth and winter survival of stocked striped bass in a Virginia mainstream reservoir	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												To explain the limited stocking success of fingerling striped bass Morone saxatilis in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia, we examined the relationship between size-selective winter survival and length-dependent patterns in growth, food habits, prey fish availability, and lipid energy reserves during the first year of life in two successive years from 1994 to 1996. Length distributions of striped bass were unimodal at the time of stocking, and growth remained positive for all fish during both growing seasons. By the fall of both years, a bimodal length distribution had developed within the age-0 cohort, which then consisted of small-mode (< 150 mm) and large-mode (> 180 mm) fish. The differential growth was attributed to size-dependent differences in prey consumption and diet quality. Small-mode striped bass: maintained a mixed diet of invertebrates and small cyprinids, whereas fish in the larger mode were strictly piscivorous, consuming only age-0 alewives Alosa pseudoharengus. The disparity in food habits, which was probably influenced by the limited availability of alewife prey to smaller striped bass, resulted in size-dependent differences in physiological condition, as larger juveniles amassed twice the lipid index levels as smaller fish by winter. By spring of both years, the bimodal length distribution had become unimodal and comprised almost entirely large-mode striped bass. In addition, large-mode fish had retained approximately 80% of their fall lipid stores, whereas surviving small-mode individuals had retained only 40% of fall lipids. These results suggest that depletion of lipid energy, possibly coupled with other size-dependent stressors. may explain the greater winter mortality of small fish. Stocking fingerling striped bass in Smith Mountain Lake at a larger size and earlier in the growing season should result in a greater proportion of stocked fish successfully switching to age-0 alewife prey, thereby improving first-year growth, winter survival, and recruitment to age 1.

Pulsed resources at tundra breeding sites affect winter irruptions at temperate latitudes of a top predator, the snowy owl	OECOLOGIA												Irruptive migration is mostly observed in species specialized on pulsed resources and is thought to be a response to unpredictable changes in food supply. We assessed two alternative hypotheses to explain the periodic winter irruptions of snowy owls Bubo scandiacus every 3-5 years in temperate North America: (a) the lack-of-food hypothesis, which states that a crash in small mammal abundance on the Arctic breeding grounds forces owls to move out of the tundra massively to search for food in winter; (b) the breeding-success hypothesis, which states that high abundance of tundra small mammals during the summer allows for high production of young, thus increasing the pool of migrants moving south the following winter. We modeled winter irruptions of snowy owls in relation to summer food resources and geographic location. Winter abundance of owls was obtained from citizen-based surveys from 1994 to 2011 and summer abundance of small mammals was collected in summer at two distant sites in Canada: Bylot Island, NU (eastern High Arctic) and Daring Lake, NWT (central Low Arctic). Winter owl abundance was positively related to prey abundance during the previous summer at both sites and tended to decrease from western to eastern temperate North America. Irruptive migration of snowy owls was therefore best explained by the breeding success hypothesis and was apparently caused by large-scale summer variations in food. Our results, combined with previous findings, suggest that the main determinants of irruptive migration may be species specific even in a guild of apparently similar species.

J	Lechler, AR; Niemi, NA				Lechler, Alex R.; Niemi, Nathan A.			The influence of snow sublimation on the isotopic composition of spring and surface waters in the southwestern United States: Implications for stable isotope-based paleoaltimetry and hydrologic studies	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The preservation of the 'delta O-18 and delta D composition of rain and snow, and resulting isotope-elevation gradients, in terrestrial waters derived from precipitation, such as streams, lakes, snowmelt, and soil waters, is often an inherent assumption in paleoclimate, hydrologic, and paleoelevation studies utilizing paleo meteoric water proxy records. Modern spring and surface water samples from the southwestern United States along a latitudinal transect at similar to 36 degrees N from the southern Sierra Nevada, California, to the central Basin and Range reveal that spring and surface waters collected from the orographic slope on the western side of the Sierra Nevada preserve isotopic compositions and delta O-18-elevation gradients (-2 to -3 parts per thousand/km) that are consistent with published regional precipitation records and that are similar to values expected based on simple Rayleigh distillation processes. In contrast, high-elevation (>= 2000 m) spring waters from the Panamint and Spring Mountains in the orographic rain shadow on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada exhibit delta O-18 values (-14 parts per thousand to -13 parts per thousand relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water [VSMOW]) that are significantly higher than those of the winter season precipitation (-22 parts per thousand to -15 parts per thousand) from which the terrestrial waters are derived, yielding spring water delta O-18-elevation gradients (similar to-0.8 parts per thousand/km) that are 2-3 times lower than those derived from regional precipitation values (similar to-2.0 parts per thousand/km) and those predicted by Rayleigh distillation models. The observed discrepancy between precipitation and terrestrial water isotopic compositions and the reduced spring water delta O-18-elevation gradients in the Panamint and Spring Mountains suggest that elevation-dependent modification of the isotopic composition of precipitation following deposition plays a key role in the isotope hydrology of meteoric water systems in the continental interior southwestern United States. We demonstrate that altitude-dependent sublimation of the winter snowpack is a viable mechanism for the observed isotopic enrichment and reduced delta O-18-elevation gradients of Basin and Range spring waters. This finding suggests that atmospheric processes alone may be insufficient to explain globally observed variations in delta O-18-elevation gradients, and that the geologic record of the delta O-18 composition of paleo meteoric waters may not accurately reflect the delta O-18 compositions of paleoprecipitation, particularly in arid environments dominated by winter precipitation in the form of snow. If unaccounted for, sublimation effects can lead to significant underestimates of both paleoelevation (on the order of 2-3 km) as well as the contribution of winter season precipitation to annual groundwater recharge. As a result, consideration of potential sublimation influence on paleo meteoric water systems, particularly as can be constrained by paleoclimate reconstructions, is necessary in order to accurately derive quantitative estimates of paleoelevation and seasonal groundwater recharge.

Seasonal changes on total fatty acid composition of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), in Ivriz Dam Lake, Turkey	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												The effects of seasonal variation on the fatty acid composition of carps Cyprinus carpio were determined. A total of 38 different fatty acids were determined in the composition of carps. There were quantitative differences between fatty acids in muscle tissue investigated, depending on the season. Oleic acid C18:1 omega 9 was the major monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) in all seasons. Palmitic acid C16:0 was identified as the major saturated fatty acid (SFA) in four seasons. Palmitoleic acid C16:1 was the third highest fatty acid in total fatty acids. MUFAs were found to be higher than SFAs and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in all seasons. Docosahexaenoic acid C22:6 omega 3, linoleic acid C18:2 omega 6 and eicosapentaenoic acid C20:5 omega 3 were the highest levels among the PUFAs. The percentages of omega 3 fatty acid were higher than those of total omega 6 fatty acid in the fatty acid composition of carp. In the present study, omega 3/omega 6 ratios were found to be 1.08, 1.43, 1.64 and 1.60 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively.

The results of 600 anatomical examinations and 9500 sections (coupes) are summarized by the author as follows: There is an important egg laying in June, at the close of the Spring rise in the streams and lakes; the egg-laying periods recur throughout the summer, autumn, and winter until in Mar., when some [female][female] (Notopteridae) do not lay at all. At all times of the yr. there were always some [female][female] sexually mature. Individuals vary greatly, so that it is necessary to examine a considerable population in order to determine the avg. or usual behavior, in respect to egg-laying. The concept of sexual maturity thus has a meaning, under troplcal conditions, that it does not have in temp. regions.																			0001-4036						1940	210						415	416																WOS:000200929700160

We examined the hypothesis that M. aeruginosa dominated (> 80% by volume) the phytoplankton population up to 10 months of each year because it maintained itself within shallow diurnal mixed layers and was thus ensured access to light, the major limiting resource. Wind speeds over Hartbeespoort Dam were strong enough to mix the entire epilimnion through Langmuir circulations only 12% of the time. At other times solar heating led to the formation of diurnal mixed layers (Z1) that were shallower (< 2 m) than the euphotic zone (Zeu; mean = 3.5 m, range: 0.45.sbd.8.4 m) while the seasonal mixed layer (Zm) was always deeper than Zeu (range: 7.sbd.18 m). By means of its buoyancy mechanism M. aeruginosa maintained the bulk of its population within Z1, while non-buoyant species sank into dark layers. Adaptation to strong light intensity was implicated from low cellular chlorophyll .alpha. content (0.132 .mu.g/106 cells) and high Ik (up to 1230 .mu.E m-2 s-1). Ensured access to light, the post-maximum summer populations persisted throughout autumn and winter, despite suboptimal temperatures, by sustaining low losses. Increased sedimentation losses caused a sharp decline of the population at the end of winter each year, and a short (2.sbd.3 months) successional episode followed, but by late spring M. aeruginosa was again dominant. The data from Hartbeespoort Dam point out the importance of distinguishing between Zm and Z1, and show the profound effect that the daily pattern of Z1, as opposed to the seasonal pattern of Zm, can have on phytoplankton population species composition.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN	1989	11	1					25	48		10.1093/plankt/11.1.25	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.1.25													WOS:A1989R897800003

The natural shallow lake and swamps land cover were converted into agricultural development land use in two stages: (1) Drainage that was accomplished in 1957; (2) Implementation of the renovated hydrological system structure, including the newly created shallow Lake Agmon-Hula (LAH), was completed in 2007. The long-term data record of the restored diversity of the submerged and emerged aquatic plant community, and its relation to water quality in the newly created shallow Lake Agmon-Hula LAH, was statistically evaluated. Internal interactions within the LAH ecosystem between aquatic plants and water quality, including nitrification, de-nitrification, sedimentation, photosynthetic intensity, and plant biomass and nutrient composition, were statistically evaluated. The plant community in LAH maintains a seasonal growth cycle of onset during late spring-summer and dieback accompanied by decomposed degradation during fall-early winter. The summer peak of aquatic plant biomass and consequent enhancement of photosynthetic intensity induces a pH increase during daytime and carbonate precipitation. Nevertheless, the ecosystem is aerobic and sulfate reduction and H2S concentration are negligible. The Hula reclamation project (HP) is aimed at the improvement of eco-tourism's integration into management design. The vegetation research confirms habitat enrichment.

Water and sediment samples were collected from Hongfeng Lake, a seasonally stratified reservoir in southwest China, in winter and summer. Diffusion fluxes of NH4+, NO3-, and labile P in summer using diffusive gradients in thin films technology were 3.4, -37.2, and 0.9 mg m(-2) day(-1), respectively, based on Fick's first law. The diffusion flux of labile P was 2.05 mg m(-2) day(-1) in winter. The contributions fraction of the labile P diffusion flux from sediment to the overlying water were higher in winter than those in summer, because of the relatively lower external input, concentrations and higher diffusion fluxes in winter. After the external input decreased, all of the three diffusion fluxes were lower than the previous record. To understand the influence effect of hydrodynamics, environmental fluid dynamics code modeling was used to simulate the flow and temperature field in winter and summer. Modeling results showed that velocity in summer was higher than that in winter due to concentrated rainfall within the catchment. Moreover, the velocity and temperature in the euphotic zone were higher than that of the hypolimnion in summer. Less variation of velocity and temperature in vertical profile in winter than that in summer was observed, which may be attributable to the high specific heat capacity and the low heat conductivity of water. There was no significant correlation among velocity, hydrochemistry, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. Hydrodynamics, solar radiation, and water depth affect the position of the thermocline, which was consequently to water temperature, hydrochemistry, dissolved nitrogen, and phosphorus concentration. Correlation analysis suggested that the higher bottom velocity and total bed shear may accelerate labile P, NH4+, and NO3- diffusion fluxes. These results provide evidence and suggestions for preventing and controlling reservoir eutrophication and water safety management.					liang, YU/IYT-4334-2023; Sun, Qingqing/MCX-9945-2025; Yue, Fu-Jun/K-7305-2017; Bhat, Mohd Aadil/GXN-4358-2022; Wang, Jingfu/ABG-1486-2021; Li, Siliang/AFB-7205-2022	liang, YU/0009-0007-3922-3454; Bhat, Mohd Aadil/0000-0002-9807-5275; Liu, Jing/0000-0002-1826-9361; Yue, Fu-Jun/0000-0003-3733-7216; Wang, Jingfu/0000-0003-0666-6041; Sun, Qingqing/0000-0001-5445-4727; 														2073-4441				NOV	2021	13	22							3232	10.3390/w13223232	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13223232													WOS:000723456500001
J	Gophen, M				Gophen, M			Nutrient and plant dynamics in Lake Agmon Wetlands (Hula Valley, Israel):: a review with emphasis on Typha domingensis (1994-1999)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Shallow lake Agmon is a newly created subtropical wetland in north-eastern Israel. The lake is part of the Hula Project aimed at slowing down deterioration processes of the peat soils, to establish infrastructure for ecotourism as an income for the land owners, and nutrient removal from Lake Kinneret inputs. An onset of benthic filamentous macro-green algae during late winter-spring season, followed by submerged macrophytes vegetation during spring-summer was documented. The phosphorus summer loads are mostly plant-mediated internal fluxes and nitrogen intensively removed from lake waters by sedimentation and denitrification. The summer phytoplankton, mostly colonial cyanobacteria, are P limited. During 1995 and early 1996, dense Typha domingensis stands were developed in the southern half of the Lake (chalk-marl bottom sediments). The P-limited Typha vegetation collapsed within less than half a year and reappeared in the south-eastern part of the lake where sediments were exposed and oxidized. It is hypothesized that phosphorus cycle is a strong dependant of macrophyte mediation, and P deficiency in the sediments predominantly affected Typha decline and an increase of P availability later enabled the reappearance of the Typha stands.																			0018-8158					DEC	2000	441	1-3					25	36		10.1023/A:1017525804657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017525804657													WOS:000167859000003

Distribution of common carp in a Spanish reservoir in relation to thermal loading from a nuclear power plant	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Arrocampo Reservoir is used as a cooling basin for a nuclear power plant located in southern Europe. Its annual mean temperature is about 30 degrees C with maxims that achieved 41.53 degrees C near the hot water effluent. Common carp (Cyprinus corpio, Linnaeus 1758) is the dominant pelagic fish species in this reservoir. Hydroacoustic surveys were conducted bimonthly over 9 years to characterize common carp abundance and distribution in the reservoir on an annual and seasonal temporal scale. Mean fish density during the period was 0.029 fish m(-3), varying from a maximum of 0.038 in 2003 to a minimum of 0.012 in 1998. There were no significant differences in the mean fish density among years. Each year, fish distribution showed significant seasonal variation. Carp were homogeneously distributed during autumn and spring: in winter carp occupied warmer outfall areas, whereas in summer, fish were distributed in the coldest area of the reservoir (dam area) but avoided the warm outfall area. These seasonal tendencies of carp distribution was repeated every years. Behavioural reaction appears to be particularly important in explain carp distribution in this reservoir.

The impact process of seasonal fluctuation on P cycling in sediments has been scarcely investigated. P forms in sediments from a freshwater lake in China were analyzed using sequential extraction technique. The vertical distribution of soluble reactive P (SRP), Fe2+, and S2-in the interstitial water was measured using diffusion gradient technique (DGT). Fick's Law and DIFS model were used to obtain the diffusion fluxes of SRP and the kinetic parameters in the water-sediment system. The results showed that total P (TP) concentrations in the solid sediments varied from 207.5, 266.6 and 130.3 mg/kg to 614.7, 1053.1, and 687.6 mg/kg in winter, spring, and summer, respectively. The concentrations of individual P forms in spring were higher than those in other seasons, with Fe-bound P (Fe-P) concentration being the highest across all seasons. Notably, significant variations of SRP concentrations were found in the interstitial water between sedimentary depths of approximately 2 cm and 6 cm, particularly in the summer. Furthermore, higher diffusion fluxes of SRP through the interface were found in summer. A stable anaerobic environment failed to develop in spring with high water level, preventing the desorption of solid Fe-P and diffusion of Fe2+ into the water due to the afflux and deposition of P-containing particulate into deeper sediment layers along with organic material. Under extreme high-temperature in summer, decreased rainfall and rising temperatures boosted the activity of aquatic organisms in the water, thereby reducing P fixation by sediments and leading to P release. This process increased the risk of P excess and potential eutrophication in the water. Generally, clarifying the resupplying processes of endogenous P in sediment systems experiencing seasonal variations is critical for eutrophication management of lakes.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				DEC 1	2023	238		2						117247	10.1016/j.envres.2023.117247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.117247		SEP 2023						37769833					WOS:001086835400001

J	BAN, S				BAN, S			EFFECTS OF PHOTOPERIOD, TEMPERATURE, AND POPULATION-DENSITY ON INDUCTION OF DIAPAUSE EGG-PRODUCTION IN EURYTEMORA-AFFINIS (COPEPODA, CALANOIDA) IN LAKE OHNUMA, HOKKAIDO, JAPAN	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Two types of eggs (diapause or subitaneous) produced by females of the copepod Eurytemora affinis from both natural and laboratory populations collected from Lake Ohnuma, Hokkaido, Japan, were examined under various photoperiod and temperature conditions. In the lake, females produce subitaneous eggs from May to mid-October and switch to producing diapause eggs in late October. In the laboratory, females raised from nauplii collected in late autumn (November) under spring conditions (15-degrees-C, 12L:12D) produced exclusively subitaneous eggs, whereas those raised from nauplii collected in spring (May) under late autumn conditions (10-degrees-C, 10L:14D) produced exclusively diapause eggs. More than 79% of the females raised from nauplii under 10L:14D, at both 10 and 15-degrees-C, produced diapause eggs, but more diapause eggs were produced at 10-degrees-C. These results indicate that the type of eggs to be produced by females of E. affinis is determined in response to environmental conditions experienced during their naupliar stages, and that a short-day photoperiod (10L:14D) is the primary cue for inducing diapause egg production, and low temperature (10-degrees-C) promotes the effect. Even under spring or summer conditions (15-degrees-C, 12L: 12D or 14L:10D), females reared in crowded cultures (>80 females.l-1) partially produced diapause eggs, suggesting that a high population density also induces the diapause egg production.																			0278-0372					AUG	1992	12	3					361	367		10.2307/1549029	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1549029													WOS:A1992JG95200004

All the groundwater samples, irrespective of season, on delta O-18-delta H-2 scale plotted along the summer precipitation, suggesting summer precipitation largely modulates recharge. The deuterium excess values of groundwater (d-excess) show clear seasonal difference, higher in winter (> 18 parts per thousand) and lower in summer (< 10 parts per thousand). And its resemblance to the summer precipitation d-excess value further suggests dominant role of summer precipitation in groundwater recharge. Based on the mass balance equation, with end-member d-excess values of seasonal precipitation and groundwater as input variables, groundwater is composed of 66% summer and 34% winter precipitation. Despite the study area being heavily forested, summer rainfall contribution higher than winter suggests that evapotranspiration effect is minimal in the region; may be due to thin sand-gravel-based porous soil overlying highly weathered granitic rock system.

Carbon turnover processes were quantified regarding external and internal sources of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM), primary production, community respiration. redox potential as well as specific loads of soluble chemical compounds such as nitrogen, iron, manganese and DOC. Over the course of the year, infiltrating DOC decreased by about 13-20% within the upper 26 cm sediment of the infiltration stretch. Gradients of all observed soluble compounds that are highly cross-linked to biological activities were highest in the topmost centimetre. In this depth mass balances (output-input) were negative concerning NO3-N (-1 mg dm(-2) d(-1), summer mean) and DOC (-2 mg dm(-2) d(-1), winter mean), respectively, while specific loads of cations such as manganese reached up to 0.2 mg dm(-2) d(-1) during summer. Carbon mineralization ranged between 3 and 7 mg C dm(-2) d(-1) and was nearly twice as high in summer as in winter. The turnover of the infiltrating DOC contributed maximally 25% in summer to 50% in winter to the entire organic carbon mineralization. Gross and net primary production differed up to a factor of >10, indicating very fast turnover reactions and the predominance of community respiration and mineralization, respectively. The POC in the upper sediment layer (10 cm) temporally varied around 1% sediment d.w.; benthic algae, organic seston input and autumnal leaf fall contributed similar percentages to the POC pool.

In this study, the seasonal and spatial variations of sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and the influencing factors were explored using pore water chemistry for the weir-impounded rivers. Muddy and sandy sediment samples were taken from 24 different sites along the four major rivers in summer and autumn, 2016. The SOD was measured in a laboratory based on 10-hour incubation at in situ temperature. The measured pore water chemistry included the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), inorganic nitrogen (NH3-N, NO3-N, NO2-N), and phosphate phosphorous (PO4-P), and the optical properties from UV absorption spectra and fluorescence excitation-emission matrixes coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Significant differences in SOD values between muddy and sandy sediments were found only in summer (p = 0.047). The higher SOD in summer versus autumn (p = 0.015) was attributed to seasonal temperature differences. The higher NH3-N and the lower NO3-N of the pore water samples in summer versus autumn suggested that organic nitrogen decomposition via an ammonification and nitrification process could operate as an important factor for the SOD variations in summer and autumn, respectively. Principal component analysis revealed the mutual contributions of nitrogen-associated processes and the organic composition in pore water to increasing SOD levels. NH3-N in sediment pore water alone could be a good predictor for SOD. However, multiple regression analysis using NH3-N, fluorescence index and terrestrial humic-like components improved the estimation capability for SOD variations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were mostly responsible for a greater fraction of protozoan bacterivory during the spring period. From 10 to 23% of bacterial production was grazed daily with the only exception of the spring peak of ciliate abundance (up to 60%). Protozoans decreased significantly during the clearwater phase (ciliates disappeared), and thus their role in bacterivory was negligible. Through the summer-fall period ciliates, not HNF, were the most important bacterial micrograzers. Protozoan community grazing balanced or even exceeded the daily bacterial production in August and September. Alternate fates of bacterial production besides protozoan grazing during the spring period are discussed.

Larger zooplankton in Danish lakes after cold winters: are winter fish kills of importance?	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th Shallow Lakes Congress 2008	NOV 23-28, 2008	Punta del Este, URUGUAY					Winter fish kills can be intense under ice in shallow lakes, and have cascading effects on the food web and ultimately on lake water clarity. In maritime Western Europe, winters are usually mild, but occasional colder periods may also have strong effects on lake fish communities. Global warming may have disproportionate effects by delaying freezing and shortening the period of ice coverage. We studied differences in zooplankton (cladocerans, copepods, and rotifers): phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton community structure, and individual body size among 37 Danish lakes of various depths, chemical characteristics, and trophy, by comparing four winters of different severity (mean winter temperatures ranging from -1.19A degrees C in 1996 to +2.9A degrees C in 1995). We found that crustacean mean body sizes were significantly larger in the summer following a severely cold winter. The zooplankton communities in the summer after a cold winter had a significantly larger proportion of larger-bodied species and taxa. Phytoplankton biomass, expressed as chlorophyll-a (chl-a), was lower and zooplankton herbivory (chl-a:TP index), higher, in the summer after the severely cold winter of 1995/1996. All these effects were stronger in shallow lakes than in deep lakes. Changes in zooplankton during summer 1996, compared with other years, were likely caused by fish kills under ice during the preceding severe winter of 1995-1996. Fish kills due to under ice oxygen depletion would be expected to occur earlier and be more complete in the shorter water columns of shallow lakes. With climate change, severe winters are predicted to become less frequent and the winters to be milder and shorter. In general, this is likely to lead to higher winter survival of fish, lower zooplankton grazing of phytoplankton the following summer and more turbid waters, particularly in shallow eutrophic lakes.

J	Sheikh, Z; Nia, AM; Han, DW				Sheikh, Zahra; Nia, Alireza Moghaddam; Han, Dawei			Climate change impact assessment on low streamflows using cross-entropy methods	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Climate change impacts on low streamflows provide a comprehensive picture of the state of surface and groundwater resources, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The objective of this study was to assess climate change impacts on low streamflow variations by detecting long-term spatio-temporal changes in climatic variables of rainfall and temperature, and their associations with low streamflow fluctuations. Seasonal variations in low streamflows (summer and winter) were examined at 18 hydrometric stations located in the Namak Lake basin, Iran, over 1970-2015, using the modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator methods. Seasonal low streamflow demonstrated a significant diminishing trend (more than 55% of the stations), while summer low streamflow showed a more drastic decreasing trend. Long-term changes in seasonal and annual rainfall/temperature also revealed a dominant decreasing trend in winter and spring rainfall (82% and 58% of all stations, respectively) and a dominant increasing trend in all temperature time scales (90% of all stations). The effects of climate variations on low streamflow were quantified by the Spearman's rank correlation and Cross-SampEn methods. The results revealed that winter rainfall, and annual and summer temperatures have the strongest association with seasonal low streamflows, especially according to the entropy method. Although the relationships between low streamflows and temperature/rainfall are related to the different processes generating streamflows, particularly in heterogeneous locations, the results show that rainfall has a stronger influence on low streamflows in the study region than temperature does. The research findings indicate low streamflows are more nonlinearly related to climatic parameters, and Cross-SampEn robustness reflects degree of asynchrony for complex and non-stationary time series.

J	Höök, TO; Pothoven, SA				Hoeoek, Tomas O.; Pothoven, Steven A.			Energy Content of Young Alewives in Eastern Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake, a Connected Drowned River Mouth Lake	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Energy content is an important determinant of an individual fish's condition and a key input variable for bioenergetics applications. Energy content of young fish can change rapidly during ontogeny; given the numerical abundance and high mass-specific metabolic rates of young fish, it is particularly important to obtain detailed information on their energy content. To this end, we quantified the total body energy content and energy density of economically and ecologically important young (age-0-1) normative alewives Alosa pseudoharengus collected during 1998-2003 in eastern Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake, a connected drowned river mouth lake. Our analysis demonstrates that energy content of young alewives varies across years, seasons, lakes, and ontogeny. Consistent with previous observations of size-dependent overwinter mortality, young alewives deplete a large amount of body energy between late fall and late spring (i.e., declines in length-specific energy content and energy density occur overwinter). Interestingly, unlike several past studies of young fish in their native range, size-specific energy content of young alewives does not appear to increase over the summer and fall (there is no evidence of increased energy storage in preparation for the resource-scarce winter period). Finally, our measured values are similar to the few previously published energy density values for age-0 alewives. The high degree of variation in the energy content of young fish emphasizes the necessity of using appropriate energy measures for bioenergetics applications to inform fisheries management.

J	Lamb, HF; vanderKaars, S				Lamb, HF; vanderKaars, S			Vegetational response to holocene climatic change: Pollen and palaeolimnological data from the Middle Atlas, Morocco	HOLOCENE												Pollen data from a radiocarbon-dated lake-sediment core from the Middle Atlas of Morocco show that forests of evergreen and winter-deciduous oaks (Quercus rotundifolia, Q. canariensis), present from the start of the Holocene, were invaded at 6200 BP by Cedrus atlantica in low numbers. Two thousand years later, after a short period characterized by higher deciduous oak frequency, Cedrus increased to its present abundance. These changes may have been in response to increasing effective moisture as summer temperatures decreased with declining northern-hemisphere seasonality, under the influence of precessional forcing. Palaeolimnological data from the same core show that the lake level fell sharply in five 200-400 yr-long and intervals, but the pollen data show little or no evidence of a vegetational response. This suggests that summer (growing-season) rainfall remained adequate during the dry intervals, whereas depletion of the groundwater aquifer was the result of reduced winter precipitation. Anthropogenic exploitation since c. 1300 BP has had a greater effect on the forest ecosystem than any of the Holocene and intervals.					; van der Kaars, Sander/G-2268-2016	Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; van der Kaars, Sander/0000-0002-2511-0439													0959-6836						1995	5	4					400	408		10.1177/095968369500500402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968369500500402													WOS:A1995TL01500002

The total volume of drainage waters pumped into the lake in 1993 amounted 2.84 x 10(6) m(3) which is equivalent to 65% of the lake volume. In spring and autumn drainage waters were extremely rich in nitrogen (especially nitrates) and the N:P ratio reached 57 in spring. In summer, drainage waters contained relatively more phosphorus so the N:P ratio decreased to nearly 10. Nutrient concentrations in lake water followed the changes in inflowing waters. High concentrations of nitrates and ammonia were noted in lake water in spring but summer concentrations of these ions were close to zero. Soluble reactive phosphorus varied between 10 and 20 mu g P l(-1) throughout the season. A constant outflow of nitrogen to the lower Lake Sniardwy was assumed based on a permanent concentration gradient between waters of these two lakes. Lake Euknajno is a hard water lake. Co-precipitation of phosphorus with calcium carbonate is likely to occur though no significant P accumulation in bottom sediments was found. Sorption of phosphorus on sediments as measured under experimental conditions has minor effects on P cycling. Bottom sediments composed mainly of calcareous gyttja do not accumulate either organic matter or mineral forms of nutrients.

Under-ice respiration rates shift the annual carbon cycle in the mixed layer of an oligotrophic lake from autotrophy to heterotrophy	INLAND WATERS												Ecosystem metabolism is an integrative measure of the production and respiration of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. However, under-ice regions and mixing periods are infrequently sampled because of logistical challenges and assumptions of low biological activity, resulting in limited understanding of the contribution of winter epilimnetic metabolism to annual carbon cycling. Aquatic ecosystems can emit up to 76% of the carbon they receive from terrestrial landscapes as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, making them significant contributors to Earth's carbon cycle. Consequently, studying metabolism under ice is especially important given that warmer winters have already shortened ice cover and lengthened ice transitional periods, potentially resulting in greater carbon dioxide emissions. Using a continuous year of epilimnetic high-frequency dissolved oxygen data, we found that gross primary production was low but not absent under ice and increased during the end of the under-ice period. Despite cold water temperatures, under-ice respiration was 1.2 times higher than summer respiration, and ice-on and ice-off periods were important contributors to annual metabolism estimates. On average, under-ice net ecosystem production (NEP) was negative, in contrast to positive NEP for the spring and summer periods. Including winter metabolism estimates flipped annual NEP from autotrophy to heterotrophy, demonstrating that year-round sampling is essential for accurately assessing carbon cycling in lakes.					; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016	Ward, Nicole Kristine/0000-0001-7549-0153; Weathers, Kathleen/0000-0002-3575-6508; Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2021	11	1					114	123		10.1080/20442041.2020.1805261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1805261		NOV 2020											WOS:000596986800001

The samples for stable isotopes were collected during the spring and autumn seasons. Sander lucioperca, as expected, was determined as a top predator with a substantially higher trophic position during both seasons (3.96, spring, delta N-15 (mean +/- SE = 13.09 +/- 0.17) and delta C-13 (mean +/- SE = -17.23 +/- 0.19) (4.10, autumn, delta N-15 (mean +/- SE = 14.14 +/- 0.19) and delta C-13 (mean +/- SE = -18.15 +/- 0.02). Three different models (IsoSource, SIAR, and Bugalho et al. (2008)) were used to determine food sources that most contributed to the food of S. lucioperca. During spring, the fishes and invertebrates, Potamon potomios and Pontastacus leptodactylus, contributed most to the food of S. lucioperca, a result obtained by the 3 models. According to the IsoSource model, among the fishes, these included Vimba vimba, Capoeta pestai, Cyprinus carpio, and S. lucioperca (cannibalism); however, according to Bugalho et al. (2008) and SIAR, Vimba vimba, Cara ssius gibeleo, and Seminemacheilus ispartensis were assimilated by S. lucioperca in greater proportion during spring. During autumn, the contribution of fishes to the S. lucioperca food source increased substantially with percentages noted as 83% and 90%, a result obtained by the IsoSource and Bugalho et al. (2008) models, respectively. The SIAR model, on the other hand, identified fishes, fish eggs, and invertebrates with mean contributions of 35%, 30%, and 16%, respectively. Invertebrates were also an important food source for S. lucioperca during this season according to Bugalho et al. (2008). In conclusion, this study showed that S. lucioperca shifted its diet from invertebrates, including crayfish, during spring, to fishes during autumn, a result also supported by the increase in the trophic position of S. lucioperca from spring to the autumn. This study is the first to report results on the food content of S. lucioperca revealed using stable isotope methods in Turkey.

J	Lofgren, BM; Zhu, YC				Lofgren, BM; Zhu, YC			Surface energy fluxes on the Great Lakes based on satellite-observed surface temperatures 1992 to 1995	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Accurate estimates of surface energy exchange components are critical for understanding many physical processes of large lakes and their atmospheric environment. In this paper, the seasonal cycle of latent, sensible, and total heat flux from the surface of the Great Lakes is estimated. Lake surface temperatures derived from the NOAA/AVHRR satellite, along with meteorological data from surface station observations are incorporated in order to estimate spatial distributions of fluxes. Several well-known features are evident. Among these are the very high outgoing fluxes of latent and sensible heat during the late fall and early winter, which drive strong cooling of the lake surface and consequent convective mixing within the lake column. Another is greater seasonal variation of surface temperature and fluxes in shallower waters than in deeper waters. Due to strong static stability of the overlying atmospheric boundary layer during the spring, both the magnitude and the spatial variations of latent and sensible heat fluxes are small during the spring and to a lesser degree, during the summer. The annual cycles of latent and sensible heat flux over the Great Lakes are roughly opposite in phase to the same fluxes over land, indicating a large exchange of energy via atmospheric advection between the lake and land surfaces. A major weakness of the method used here is that heat fluxes are calculated on the basis of an ice-free surface, making the derived fluxes for January through March roughly estimated.

This electric barrier system serves to prevent the upstream migration of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) to Lake Michigan from the Illinois River. We found that fish were most abundant below the electric barrier during the summer and fall, were observed near areas of peak voltage, and sometimes persistently challenged the barrier. Fish were relatively scarce within the barrier system during the winter and spring. Fish that were able to penetrate the farthest into the barrier system were smaller and tended to aggregate at the water surface, near the canal walls. The accumulation of fish that we observed below the barrier, and the persistent challenging behavior, raises concerns about breaches any time the barrier is de-energized for maintenance or during intermittent power outages. Entrainment and breach caused by barges traversing the barrier are concerns as well because of the water movements they create and how they alter the electrical field.

Solms) on Lake Tana and associated water loss	HELIYON												The introduction of water hyacinth poses a serious threat to economic viability of Lake Tana and its environments. This study aimed to capture the spatial coverage of water hyacinth and its effect on water loss in Lake Tana using quantitative research methods. Four satellite images representing each season of 2019 were downloaded from USGS. In addition, pan evaporation data were taken from the National Meteorological Agency. ArcGis 10.4, Envi 5.3, Qgis 3.12.1 plug in CSP and Excel used to manage land use land cover classification and water loss estimation analysis. The seasonal coverage of water hyacinth was 15.35, 4.14, 11.82 and 13.59 km(2) in winter, autumn, summer and spring 2019 respectively representing 0.63 and 0.17 percent of the Lake as a maximum and minimum coverage. The mean daily evaporation of Lake Tana was 5.14 mm/day, but this increased to 18.85 mm/day due to the presence of water hyacinth. The mean net daily water loss due to water hyacinth at Lake Tana was 0.14 km(2) while 52,62 km(3) in 2019. The study concludes that water hyacinth caused enormous negative impact on the water volume reduction in Lake Tana. Management of the Lake Tana environment and control of the water hyacinth weed are recommended to sustain the Lake.					; Mengistu, Daniel/MBG-8025-2025	Mengistu, Daniel/0000-0002-8312-6957; 														2405-8440				OCT	2021	7	10							e08196	10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08196		OCT 2021						34729433					WOS:000715112800007

Water quality data collected from 4 sampling sites during 4 seasons was analysed for 13 parameters. Significant variation (p<0.05) in temperature, pH, EC, Ca, Mg, Na, K, DO, BOD5, COD, PO4-P, NH4-N and NO3-N of sampling sites during different seasons was observed. Cluster analysis grouped 4 sampling sites during 4 seasons into three clusters of similar water quality as relatively less polluted (LP), medium polluted (MP) and highly polluted (HP) sites. The principal component analysis/factor analysis applied to extract and recognize the factors responsible for water quality variations in four seasons of the year resulted in three principal components for each season accounting for 75.78%, 83.25%, 87.33% and 78.96% of total variance for winter, spring, summer and autumn seasons respectively. Parameters like NH4-N, NO3-N, BOD5 and COD have strong positive loading whereas temperature an(d) dissolved oxygen has strong negative loading. Thus, from the principal component/factor analysis it is clear that the domestic wastewaters, agricultural runoff and catchment geology play significant role in water quality variations in the Dal Lake for all the four seasons.																			1743-3541		978-1-84564-608-0				2012	164						123	134		10.2495/WP120111	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/WP120111													WOS:000345657500011

This study investigated the seasonal variation of major nutrients and probabilistic eutrophic state in surface water from Honghu Lake. Average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and transparency (SD) in summer and winter generally exceeded Grade III of the Chinese environmental quality standards for surface water (GB 3838-2002), with the exception of CODMn in winter. Mean concentrations of Chl-a and CODMn in summer were higher than that in winter, while mean concentrations of TN, TP and SD were slightly higher in winter. The improved probabilistic comprehensive trophic level index (PTLI) method based on stochastic-fuzzy theory was established to evaluate the eutrophic state in Honghu Lake. Compared with the Monte-Carlo sampling method, the Latin Hypercube sampling (LH-TFN) method was selected for the evaluation simulation due to its efficiency and stability. Evaluation results indicated that mean PTLI in summer (69.70) and winter (61.96) were both subordinated to Grade IV (Medium eutrophication). The corresponding reliability of eutrophication level subordinating to Grade IV in summer was of relatively low reliability (51.27%), which might mislead decision makers to some extent and suggest recheck. The probabilistic eutrophication level in summer developed with a trend from medium to severe eutrophication. Sensitivity analysis illustrated that CODMn and Chl-a were the priority pollutants in summer, with the contributions to PTLI of 43.3% and 22.5% respectively. Chl-a was the priority pollutant in winter, with the contribution to PTLI up to 51.3%.

Despite extensive research in microbial diversity and community composition, little is known about seasonal variations of microbial community structure (especially micro eukaryotes) in response to environmental conditions in AMD ecosystem. To this end, AMD samples were collected from Nanshan AMD lake, Anhui Province, China, over a full seasonal cycle from 2013 to 2014, and water chemistry and microbial composition were studied. pH of lake water was stable (similar to 3.0) across the sampling period, while the concentrations of ions varied dramatically. The highest metal concentrations in the lake were found for Mg and Al, not commonly found Fe. Unexpectedly, ultrahigh concentration of chlorophyll a was measured in the extremely acidic lake, reaching 226.43-280.95 mu g/L in winter, even higher than those in most eutrophic freshwater lakes. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities showed a strong seasonal variation. Among the prokaryotes, "Ferrovum", a chemolithotrophic iron-oxidizing bacterium was predominant in most sampling seasons, although it was a minor member prior to September, 2012. Fe2+ was the initial geochemical factor that drove the variation of the prokaryotic community. The eukaryotic community was simple but varied more drastically than the prokaryotic community. Photoautotrophic algae (primary producers) formed a food web with protozoa or flagellate (top consumers) across all four seasons, and temperature appeared to be responsible for the observed seasonal variation. Ochromonas and Chlamydomonas (responsible for high algal bloom in winter) occurred in autumn/summer and winter/spring seasons, respectively, because of their distinct growth temperatures. The closest phylogenetic relationship between Chlamydomonas species in the lake and those in Arctic and Alpine suggested that the native Chlamydomonas species may have been both acidophilic and psychrophilic after a long acclimation time in this extreme environment.

Influence of integrated watershed-scale agricultural conservation practices on lake water quality	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Watershed-scale management efforts to improve conservation of water resources in agricultural watersheds depend upon the effectiveness of integrated multiple agricultural best management practices (BMPs). To more comprehensively assess the effectiveness of combined BMPs on water quality requires large-scale, long-term (> 10 year) studies measuring key water quality parameters. One such suite of critical water quality parameters includes water clarity, total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS). To address this, Beasley Lake, a 25 ha (62 ac) oxbow lake located in a 915 ha (2,261 ac) watershed of intensive row crop agricultural activity, was studied. The lake was sediment impaired when monitoring was initiated in 1995 and was a candidate to assess the effectiveness of watershed-wide BMPs on lake water clarity (as Secchi depth), TSS concentrations, and TDS. A variety of BMPs within row crop fields, at field edges throughout the watershed, and enrollment of 112 ha (277 ac) into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) between 1997 to 2006 focused on reducing soil erosion and concomitant sediment runoff. Selected parameters were measured approximately biweekly from 1996 to 2009. During this 14-year period, changes in row crop management and BMP implementations and alterations were observed and recorded in conjunction with targeted water quality parameters. While annual improvement in water quality occurred, distinct seasonal effects were noticeable. Observed changes in water clarity and TSS concentrations were greatest during spring and least in winter in association with increased BMPs, vegetated buffer strips west of the lake, and CRP north of the lake. Observed decreases in TDS concentrations were greatest during summer and fall in association with implemented CRP north of the lake. Reductions in spring TSS by > 60% often directly increased spring water clarity by > 100%. Results of this study indicate clear improvement in lake water quality with watershed-wide implementation of integrated multiple agricultural BMPs, and these improvements, manifested most strongly during spring, will assist to promote a healthy, sustainable lake ecosystem.					; Knight, Scott/AAE-9063-2022	Locke, Martin/0000-0001-7145-530X; 													0022-4561	1941-3300				MAR-APR	2014	69	2					160	170		10.2489/jswc.69.2.160	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.69.2.160													WOS:000332787600014
J	De Jong, R; Kamenik, C				De Jong, Rixt; Kamenik, Christian			Validation of a chrysophyte stomatocyst-based cold-season climate reconstruction from high-Alpine Lake Silvaplana, Switzerland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												For the reliable assessment of past climate variability, quantitative reconstructions of seasonal temperatures are required. Currently, reconstructions of cold-season temperatures are scarce, because most biological proxies are biased towards the growing season. Here we test the potential of chrysophyte stomatocysts (or simply 'cysts'; siliceous resting stages of the golden-brown algae) as a proxy for cold-season temperature. Climate reconstructions based on biological proxies are commonly constructed using transfer functions derived from calibration in space. However, the performance of these reconstructions is rarely tested by direct comparison with meteorological data due to limitations of sample resolution or chronological control. We compare a cyst-based near-annual reconstruction of 'date of spring mixing' from the varved sediments of Lake Silvaplana (Swiss Alps) spanning AD 1870 2004 with climate variables from the same period measured at the lake shore. The high correlation between cyst-based 'date of spring mixing' and cold-season temperature demonstrates the ability of chrysophyte cysts to archive cold-season temperature variability. Lake eutrophication, which was extensive during the last 50 years, had no obvious effect on the cyst-based reconstruction. This study underlines the high potential of chrysophyte cysts as a quantitative proxy for cold-season climate reconstructions.

J	STODDARD, JL				STODDARD, JL			ALKALINITY DYNAMICS IN AN UNACIDIFIED ALPINE LAKE, SIERRA-NEVADA, CALIFORNIA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Gem Lake, a small, unacidified, high elevation lake in the Sierra Nevada, undergoes an annual cycle of low alkalinity (between 30 and 40 .mu.eq liter-1) during the ice-free season and high alkalinity (> 240 .mu.eq liter-1) in fall and winter. Both pH and alkalinity decrease drastically (up to one unit for pH and 200 .mu.eq liter-1 for alkalinity) during spring snowmelt, but chemistry of the snow, snowmelt, and runoff indicate that the declines in alkalinity are due to dilution rather than acidification. The hydraulic residence time in the lake increases from about 135 d in winter to < 7 d during snowmelt; high alkalinity water is simply flushed from the lake and replaced by water with an ionic composition very near that of the snowmelt runoff. Increases in alkalinity in fall and winter can be accounted for by the rates of weathering in the watershed. A mass balance approach is used to reconstruct weathering reactions in the basin; it suggests that the lake receives both surface runoff, with the weathering products of the hydrolysis of granodiorite minerals to kaolinite, and deep water from subterranean circulation, with the products of granodiorite weathering to both kaolinite and smectite.

We studied two planktonic freshwater lineages (LD28 and PRD01a001B) affiliated with Methylophilaceae (Betaproteobacteria) in Lake Zurich, Switzerland, by a combination of molecular and cultivation-based approaches. Their spatio-temporal distribution was monitored at high resolution (n=992 samples) for 4 consecutive years. LD28 methylotrophs constituted up to 11 x 10(7) cells l(-1) with pronounced peaks in spring and autumn-winter, concomitant with blooms of primary producers. They were rare in the warm water layers during summer but abundant in the cold hypolimnion, hinting at psychrophilic growth. Members of the PRD01a001B lineage were generally less abundant but also had maxima in spring. More than 120 axenic strains from these so far uncultivated lineages were isolated from the pelagic zone by dilution to extinction. Phylogenetic analysis separated isolates into two distinct genotypes. Isolates grew slowly (mu(max)=0.4 d(-1)), were of conspicuously small size, and were indeed psychrophilic, with higher growth yield at low temperatures. Growth was enhanced upon addition of methanol and methylamine to sterile lake water. Genomic analyses of two strains confirmed a methylotrophic lifestyle with a reduced set of genes involved in C1 metabolism. The very small and streamlined genomes (1.36 and 1.75 Mb) shared several pathways with the marine OM43 lineage. As the closest described taxa (Methylotenera sp.) are only distantly related to either set of isolates, we propose a new genus with two species, that is, 'Candidatus Methylopumilus planktonicus' (LD28) and ` Candidatus Methylopumilus turicensis' (PRD01a001B).					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008; Salcher, Michaela/A-1141-2013	Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523													1751-7362	1751-7370				NOV	2015	9	11					2442	2453		10.1038/ismej.2015.55	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2015.55								25942006					WOS:000365091700011

J	Halvorsen, G				Halvorsen, G			Some physical and chemical characteristics of Lake Atnsjoen	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The physical and chemical characteristics of the dimictic, ultraoligotrophic, and subalpine Lake Atnsjoen are described based on data from the period 1985-2001. The temperature stratification of the lake is weakly developed, with the thermocline at about 10 m depth. The surface temperature during summer is usually lower than 14-15degreesC. The Secchi disk transparency is normally higher than 8-10 m in summer and autumn, but can be as low as 4.3 m during spring. The pH is about 6.0, and the specific conductivity about 1.0 mS m(-1). The dominating cation and anion are Ca (approximate to0.8 mg l(-1) or 42 mueq l(-1)), and SO4 (approximate to1.5 mg l(-1) or 33 mueq l(-1)), respectively. The concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3, mueq l(-1)) is sometimes lower, sometimes higher than that of SO4.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2004	521	1-3					129	140		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026355.60067.6b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026355.60067.6b													WOS:000221177900011

A comparison of 7 sampling options in Lake Pearson, Canterbury, New Zealand, shows that spot samples and line transects are inadequate but that an augmented line transect is almost as good as stratified random sampling. Winter/early spring and summer samples are needed to account for seasonal variations in species richness and community biomass. Much less effort is required for an augmented line transect, therefore it is recommended for lake survey and management studies.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1985	19	1					71	77		10.1080/00288330.1985.9516076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1985.9516076													WOS:A1985ARL8800007

During the heavy rainfall period, phosphate and silicate concentrations sharply increased while dissolved oxygen, pH and chl a decreased. Nitrate concentration was relatively stable over the period. Chl a concentration showed an inverse relationship with phosphate and silicate concentrations. A high DIN/DIP ratio ranging from 25 to 1,813 led chlorophytes to be predominant over the whole period. During autumn, silicate concentration considerably decreased and played an important role as a limiting factor for diatoms. The physical disturbance of the water column due to rainfall seemed to be the major factor determining phytoplankton biomass in the water. Additionally, phytoplankton groups displayed the seasonal succession: domination of bacillariophytes, cryptophytes and chlorophytes during spring, chlorophytes in summer, and cyanobacteria in autumn. The composition and succession of phytoplankton species were typical of these of very eutrophic lakes.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2002	17	4					507	520																WOS:000180470900003

Of these, 56 banded as nestlings at Basnard Lake during 1973-75 were also wing-marked. Sightings [103] of wing-marked individuals and 13 band recoveries, all subsequent to departure of the birds from their breeding grounds, show a fall movement through southern Saskatchewan to wintering rounds across a broad region extending from Montana to Missouri, Texas, and southern California [USA]. One individual was seen in Nov. 1974, 1975 and 1976 at the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge in Missouri. Summer sightings showed that some of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th yr individuals returned to the lake where they were raised, while 1 bird was seen in summer about 480 km NW of its lake of origin. One bird was found dead in its 4th fall in Alaska [USA], indicating intermixing between interior and coastal eagle populations. Observations of known-age birds suggest some differences from previous descriptions of plumage development at various ages.																			0008-3550						1978	92	4					375	382																WOS:A1978GF70500008

Lake Woodruff and Lake Apopka are 36 miles apart, but differ in several environmental parameters. Compared with Lake Woodruff, Lake Apopka is warmer, more shallow in sampling areas (particularly during drought conditions; approximately 15-90 cm in Lake Apopka versus 60-120 cm in Lake Woodruff), more turbid, and more heavily contaminated with nutrients and industrial and agricultural chemicals. Here, we present detailed information on seasonal reproduction patterns in mosquitofish in their native range and compare patterns between fish from the two lakes. Male mosquitofish were reproductively active from spring through fall. Spermatogenesis, which is regulated in part by 11-ketotestosterone, ceased in October, and fish stored spermatozoa through the winter for immediate fertilization of offspring in the spring. Compared with Lake Woodruff, fish from Lake Apopka tended to be larger and have longer gonopodia and greater gonado- and hepato-somatic indices (GSI and HSI). High GSI in Apopka fish correlated with greater spermatid production, but fewer mature spermatozoa and either the same or lower sperm counts and sperm viability. Taken together, these observations suggest that differentiation of spermatids to spermatozoa is disrupted in Apopka fish, leading to reductions in fertility in some months. Delivery of sperm to females could also be affected in Apopka fish, which exhibit lower prevalence of efferent duct tissue in the testes during the summer.

The aim of this research was to assess, for the first time in these lakes, the relationships among PCC, bacteria, and archaea, and the effects of environmental drivers. We observed a clear difference of PCC compositions in spring and summer. All the lakes showed Bacillariophyta dominating in spring, whereas in summer, there were remarkable differences of PCC. Prokaryoplankton composition showed more pronounced differences in the vertical profile than those between spring and summer. The oligomictic lakes showed a uniform vertical gradient of prokaryotes in spring, while in the meromictic lakes, their abundances were incremented with depth. In summer, the prokaryotic community changed, and niche differentiation occurred in almost all lakes. In conclusion, our study showed a general pattern, common to all the lakes, of a first appearance of the large-sized opportunistic bacteria in spring, followed by ultramicrobacteria, less vulnerable to predation in summer. Significant correlations between a few PCC and bacterial groups were found, thus elucidating that functional interactions can be the key to understand plankton successions.					; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012; Morabito, Giuseppe/AAY-1223-2020; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015	LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2018	824	1			SI		71	92		10.1007/s10750-018-3586-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3586-z													WOS:000448578500004

Yellow perch genetic structure and habitat use among connected habitats in eastern Lake Michigan	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Maintenance of genetic and phenotypic diversity is widely recognized as an important conservation priority, yet managers often lack basic information about spatial patterns of population structure and its relationship with habitat heterogeneity and species movement within it. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on the economically and ecologically prominent yellow perch (Perca flavescens). In the Lake Michigan basin, yellow perch reside in nearshore Lake Michigan, including drowned river mouths (DRMs)-protected, lake-like habitats that link tributaries to Lake Michigan. The goal of this study was to examine the extent that population structure is associated with Great Lakes connected habitats (i.e., DRMs) in a mobile fish species using yellow perch as a model. Specifically, we tested whether DRMs and eastern Lake Michigan constitute distinct genetic stocks of yellow perch, and if so, whether those stocks migrate between the two connected habitats throughout the year. To do so, we genotyped yellow perch at 14 microsatellite loci collected from 10 DRMs in both deep and littoral habitats during spring, summer, and autumn and two nearshore sites in Lake Michigan (spring and autumn) during 2015-2016 and supplemented our sampling with fish collected in 2013. We found that yellow perch from littoral-DRM habitats were genetically distinct from fish captured in nearshore Lake Michigan. Our data also suggested that Lake Michigan yellow perch likely use deep-DRM habitats during autumn. Further, we found genetic structuring among DRMs. These patterns support hypotheses of fishery managers that yellow perch seasonally migrate to and from Lake Michigan, yet, interestingly, these fish do not appear to interbreed with littoral fish despite occupying the same DRM. We recommend that fisheries managers account for this complex population structure and movement when setting fishing regulations and assessing the effects of harvest in Lake Michigan.

INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WATER CHEMISTRY, PHYTOPLANKTON POPULATIONS AND PERIPHYTON POPULATIONS IN A SHALLOW LAKE AND ASSOCIATED EXPERIMENTAL RESERVOIRS (LUND TUBES)	BRITISH PHYCOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Water chemistry, phytoplankton populations and periphyton populations on Potamogeton pectinatus, were compared in a shallow, brackish lake, Hickling Broad Norfolk, England, UK, and in two enclosed, 20 m diameter butyl rubber reservoirs, placed in it. The seasonal changes of periphyton on Hippuris vulgaris and Myriophyllum spicatum in the lake were also examined. The lake was made more eutrophic by agricultural land drainage and roosting gull populations, the tubes to a greater extent by gulls perching on their rims. The water in the tubes became persistently dominated by colonial blue-green algae, a spring diatom pulse was absent and severe fiber N limitation was found. Periphyton on P. pectinatus in the tubes was scanty. In the lake, though phytoplankton chlorophyll a levels were lower, an alternation of spring diatom and summer colonial blue-green algae was recorded. N limitation was less severe in the lake and abundant periphyton crops, mainly of diatoms, developed on P. pectinatus and to an even greater extent on the other macrophytes. The differential development of the periphyton in the tubes and lake was related to differential N availability in these P-enriched waters and the muted seasonality of the phytoplankton in the tubes to the absence of flushing of the water body in autumn and winter. The periphyton diatom populations were of 2 species groups, one apparently confined to the periphyton, the other of species shared with the plankton. These latter, Diatoma elongatum and Synedra sp. underwent cell division in both the periphyton and in the plankton and appeared not to be casual introductions into either community.																			0007-1617						1981	16	1					59	76		10.1080/00071618100650061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071618100650061													WOS:A1981LF09600004

Muscle samples for analyses were taken from the large side muscle of the fish body above the lateral line. The study involved 56 individuals caught in fall and spring. Analyses were carried out on 14 females and 14 males caught in each season. The percentage content of fat in the fish meat was determined with the modified method of FOLCH et al. (1957). The cholesterol content was determined with the modified Liebermann-Burchardt colorimetric method using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV-VIS-NIR-3100). The fatty acid profile was determined with the gas chromatograph with a flame-ionization detector. Analyses indicated that the percentage content of fat was higher in the meat of roach caught in autumn (0.96% in females and 0.91% in males) than in the tissues of individuals from spring, which was 0.67% and 0.86%, respectively. The content of the total cholesterol was higher in autumn (64.17 mg 100g(-1)) than in spring (56.25 mg 100g(-1)), and these values significantly differed (p<0.05). Statistical analyses indicated that there were no significant differences in the content of fat and cholesterol between females and males caught in both seasons. The total amounts of SFA, MUFA and PUFA ranged from 30.05% to 33.57%, from 39.53% to 47.64% and from 19.96% to 27.42%, respectively. Analyses of correlations between fatty acids from the n-3 and n-6 group indicated a positive and statistically significant relationship between C20:4 n-6 and C22:4 n-6 (p= 0.000, R=0.9065) and C20:5 n-3 and C22:6 n-3 (p=0.000, r=0.8555). The ratio of n-3/n-6 was highest in the meat of roach caught in spring (0.50-0.81) than in autumn (0.50-0.77).

Naranbagh (alt. 1587 m) is a polymictic, shallow marl lake in the flood-plain valley of Kashmir, India. Macrofloral affinities resemble ''Potamogeton Type'' of Forsberg (1965) with alkaline waters, not rich in phosphorus, CaCO3 precipitation coupled with decline in Ca2+ and alkalinity values are characteristic of the lake. Fluctuations in Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Cl- were relatively conservative. The levels of .**GRAPHIC**. and .**GRAPHIC**. indicate moderate fertility of the lake water. Persistence of a summer-autumn planktonic algal pulse is related to favourable irradiance, high water temperatures, and increased photosynthetic efficiency values. The most striking seasonality in photosynthetic rates (m-2 h-1) between winter minimum (.SIGMA.3 mg Cassim) and summer maximum (.SIGMA.75.4 mg Cassim) is determined by mainly climatic changes. Energy flow gave annual phytoplankton production of 51.95 .times. 102 KJ m-2 for the ecosystem. The nutrient levels and productivity rates suggest mesotrophic status of L.

Microcrustacean zooplankton were the dominant prey of alewife during April-October in 1972 and 1988. Although Bythotrephes was not found in 1988 net samples, it replaced other zooplankters in the alewife's diet. Typically, tailspines were the only part of Bythotrephes in alewife stomachs; their frequency was high in April-May, diminished rapidly in summer, and was very low by fall. In spring 1988, alewife greater-than-or-equal-to 165 mm were in better condition than in spring 1972, and this may have been due to larger fish feeding more heavily on Bythotrephes. Variation in diet among widely separated sampling sites was due to differences in alewife abundance, stability of thermal structure, progress of zooplankton community development, and distance to the mouth of the Niagara River (through which Bythotrephes probably enter the lake in summer and fall). In the Great Lakes, inter- and intralake differences in diet clearly exist, and these must be incorporated into models of alewife planktivory to gain an accurate understanding of energy flow between trophic levels.																			0706-652X					OCT	1992	49	10					2009	2019		10.1139/f92-224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-224													WOS:A1992JY88100006
J	Hampton, SE; Sharma, S; Brousil, MR; Filazzola, A				Hampton, Stephanie E.; Sharma, Sapna; Brousil, Matthew R.; Filazzola, Alessandro			Winter and summer storms modify chlorophyll relationships with nutrients in seasonally ice-covered lakes	ECOSPHERE												At broad spatial scales, primary productivity in lakes is known to increase in concert with nutrients, and variables that may disrupt or modify the tight coupling of nutrients and algae are of increasing interest, particularly for those shifting with climate change. Storms may disrupt algae-nutrient relationships, but the expected effects differ between winter and summer seasons, particularly for seasonally ice-covered lakes. In winter, storms can dramatically change the under-ice light environment, creating light limitation that disrupts algae-nutrient relationships. Further, storms can bring both snow that blocks light and also wind that blows snow off of ice. In open water conditions, storms may promote turbulence and external nutrient loading. Here, we test the hypotheses that winter and summer storms differentially affect algae-nutrient relationships across 84 seasonally ice-covered lakes included in the Ecology Under Lake Ice dataset. While nutrients explained most of the variation in chlorophyll across these lakes, we found that secondary drivers differed between seasons. Under-ice chlorophyll was higher under a variety of precipitation and wind conditions that tend to promote snow-free clear ice, highlighting the importance of light as a limiting factor for algal growth during winter. In summer, higher water temperatures and storms corresponded with higher chlorophyll. Our study suggests that examining ice-covered lakes in a gradient from the perennial ice cover of the poles to the intermittent ice cover of lower latitudes would yield key information on the shifts in light and nutrient limitation that control algal biomass.

Various factors have been hypothesized as the dominant Asian monsoon forcings, however, the forcings can change from interannual to millennial timescales. The linkages between monsoon forcings at different timescales remain unclear. To better understand the connection of the variabilities and mechanisms of the East Asian monsoon at various timescales, we present a modern analog. Various climatic data, monsoon indices, and circulation factor calculations were used to identify the variabilities and controlling factors of the modern East Asian summer and winter monsoons. Paleo-climatic proxies from a region sensitive to both summer and winter monsoons were used in concert with monsoon simulation data to reconstruct and analyze paleo-monsoon variations and mechanisms. Results showed that the weakening of the Holocene Asian summer and winter monsoons is closely linked to low-latitude summer insolation and mid-latitude winter insolation, while modern summer and winter monsoons are related to global circulation, sea surface temperature, and sea ice change. We confirm that the driving mechanism of the monsoon was dependent on timescale.

Here, we present one of the first in-lake experiments to postpone ice-cover onset (by <= 21 d), thereby extending light availability (by <= 40 d) in early winter, and explicitly demonstrate cascading effects on pelagic food web processes and phenologies. Delaying ice-on elicited a sequence of events from winter to spring: 1) relatively greater densities of algal resources and primary consumers in early winter; 2) an enhanced prevalence of winteractive (overwintering) consumers throughout the ice-covered period, associated with augmented storage of high-quality fats likely due to a longer access to algal resources in early winter; and 3) an altered trophic structure after ice-off, with greater initial springtime densities of overwintering consumers driving stronger, earlier top-down regulation, effectively reducing the spring algal bloom. Increasingly later ice onset may thus promote consumer overwintering, which can confer a competitive advantage on taxa capable of surviving winters upon ice-off; a process that may diminish spring food availability for other consumers, potentially disrupting trophic linkages and energy flow pathways over the subsequent open-water season. In considering a future with warmer winters, these results provide empirical evidence that may help anticipate phenological responses to freshwater ice loss and, more broadly, constitute a case of climate-induced cross-seasonal cascade on realized food web processes.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020; Hébert, Marie-Pier/AAJ-6769-2020	Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Hebert, Marie-Pier/0000-0003-4733-0974; Fussmann, Gregor/0000-0001-9576-0122													0027-8424	1091-6490				NOV 30	2021	118	48							e2114840118	10.1073/pnas.2114840118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2114840118								34810251					WOS:000723881800052

Microbial community composition and diversity were measured by napA gene sequencing. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Mantel analysis were used to study the environmental factors that drive subcommunities with different rarity in summer and winter. Based on network analysis, the symbiotic relationship of subcommunities with different rarity in summer and winter was discussed. The assembly mechanism of subcommunities with different rarity in summer and winter was investigated by null model analysis. The influence factor of different rarity subcommunity diversity in summer and winter was studied based on structural equation modeling (SEM).Results and discussionWe found that the & alpha;-diversity of winter was higher than that of summer, and the & alpha;-diversity of rare taxa (RT) was higher than that of abundant taxa (AT). Nitrate (NO3--N) was the most critical factor affecting AT in two seasons; temperature (T) and CODMn were the most critical environmental factors affecting RT in summer and winter, respectively. All taxa were significantly affected by dissolved oxygen (DO) in winter. The network analysis showed that symbiotic relationships were dominant among species, and the interrelationship between groups was closer in winter. RT was more crucial for preserving the stability of the bacterial community's overall composition and structure, but AT had stronger environmental adaptability. The null model revealed that dispersal limitation predominated in the community assembly of AT and RT. With the increase of rarity, the contribution of undominated and homogeneous dispersal to microbial subcommunity aggregation increases. The SEM revealed a significant detrimental impact of NO3--N and NO2--N on & beta;-diversity of AT and RT in summer (P = 0.009, n = 16 and P = 0.002, n = 16) but promoted & beta;-diversity of AT and RT in winter. CODMn, Mn, pH, and DO had the greatest influence on & beta;-diversity of AT and RT in winter.ConclusionIn conclusion, our study enhances the understanding of aerobic denitrifying bacterial community diversity, assemblage patterns, and environmental driving mechanisms, and provides important implications for microbial ecology. Moreover, these results provide strategies for the subsequent screening of aerobic denitrifying bacteria in natural water, which is of great significance for the realization of in situ nitrogen removal in natural water.

Its sediments have a fine granulometry and are evenly distributed. The bathymetry and hydrodynamic behaviour of the basin create two zones with restricted exchanges between them. The western part (60% of the total surface area) is rich in dissolved phosphate (> 1 mg l(-1) in summer) and receives the majority of the phosphate (P) inputs from the watershed. The heavy macroalgal population consists of Gracilaria throughout the year and Ulva in summer and autumn. Phytoplankton levels sometimes reach 100 mu g l(-1) of chlorophyll a. The sediment-water phosphate exchange varies with environmental conditions and macroalgal growth. P mobility was studied on the basis of these characteristics. Algal biomass and water characteristics were measured at 15-day intervals throughout 1993. A seasonal study was conducted in 1994 to investigate which P fractions in the sediment were involved in the exchanges. The springtime rise in temperature reactivated decomposition of the macroalgal biomass that had accumulated in autumn. The redox potential (EH) fell as a result of this biological activity, leading to a decrease in the inorganic P fractions. This P release accounts for the higher P water concentrations observed in the lagoon in summer. The mobility of P fractions shows that the P stored in the sediments plays an active role in the dynamics of the overlying water. Seasonal variations in these fractions explain the patterns of P storage and mobilization.

However, how trophic interactions (i.e., biotic factors) regulate the diversity and composition of bacterial community in lake ecosystems remains unknown. Here, we employed DNA meta-barcoding of water samples to explore the impact of bacterivorous protozoans on the bacterial community. The results showed significant seasonal variations in the diversity and composition of both bacterial and protist communities. The composition of bacterivorous protozoans was identified as the primary predictor for the bacterial community alpha diversity in spring and summer, and for beta diversity in spring and autumn, indicating that biotic interactions play a greater role in driving the diversity of bacterial community across different seasons. Biological factors were more important than environmental factors for explaining the variations in the relative abundance of several bacterial genera (i.e., Pseudoxanthomonas, hgcI_clade, and Pseudorhodobacter). Network analyses showed that bacterial networks differed among seasons, and the autumn network exhibited the highest stability. Our findings indicated that the bacterial community stability was significantly affected by environmental factors, specifically SO42-and PO43-, rather than bacterivorous protozoans. Overall, our findings provide new perspectives on the role of trophic interactions in maintaining the structure of bacterial community in different seasons, and enhance our understanding of the bacterial community assembly in lake ecosystems.																			2096-6490	2662-1746				FEB	2025	7	1					176	186		10.1007/s42995-024-00256-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42995-024-00256-8		OCT 2024						40027328					WOS:001347524700001

Therefore, this species is generally believed to be irruptive, moving in response to external environmental stimuli such as food limitation or overpopulation in the breeding area. We studied the locomotory activity of 24 young captive long-tailed tits from August up to early May of the following year. All hand raised birds from the local population of Lake Ladoga region (NW Russia) exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern in their locomotory activity similar to birds trapped on migration. They showed a rise in activity both in autumn and spring period. Fat reserves did not peak in autumn but increased along with spring activity. The timing of increase in the locomotory activity and fat reserves, as well as daily pattern and maximum level of activity in autumn depended on photoperiod. Long-tailed tits kept on the photoperiod, simulating late hatching, started to migrate at an earlier age and showed a significantly higher level of activity in autumn compared to their siblings kept on the photoperiod simulating early hatching. The present findings suggested that in the studied species there is an annual cycle of migratory restlessness that is exhibited in captivity and is influenced by photoperiod.

Large decreases occur in TDP [total dissolved P] and SRS [soluble reactive silica] in particular but also in TDN [total dissolved N] from spring to summer. The distribution of individual species of algae with depth in the epilimnion was seldom uniform but more commonly conformed to a definite pattern. The simultaneous existence of different patterns in different species provides evidence of spatial heterogeneity (niche diversification) in the epilimnion, which could lessen any interspecific competition. Diatom stratigraphy in a 70-cm core revealed that the lake was eutrophic throughout but may have gone through 3 periods; the most recent one was the most eutrophic and was preceeded by a period of unusually low water levels.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	79	3					245	253		10.1007/BF00006320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006320													WOS:A1981LP99100006

Surface water of the Lake Coatetelco shifted from mostly Ca-Mg-HCO3 facies in wet summer-autumn to Na-HCO3-Cl facies in the dry spring due to elevated Na, Cl and HCO3. Greater evaporation in spring led to a maximum delta O-18 enrichment of ca.7 parts per thousand compared to the other seasons, and much depleted deuterium excess (-40.92 parts per thousand to -39.20 parts per thousand). Interaction of the lake water with subsurface carbonate lithologies, and comparable isotopic compositions reflected the enhanced interaction between the surface water body and aquifers in the wet autumn. Effect of seasonality, however, was unclear on the groundwater facies, and its heterogenous composition (Ca-Mg-HCO3, Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-HCO3) reflected the interactions with different lithologies. Fractionations in isotope compositions of the groundwater were caused from recharge at different elevations, seasonality of moisture sources and moisture recycling. The water-mineral saturation index was an efficient proxy of seasonality as the lake water and groundwater (avg SIcalcite > 0.5) of the dry autumn were saturated with calcite. This vital information about carbonate precipitation, pCO(2) and chemical facies would be useful for the better interpretation of paleoclimate archives in this region.

DEMOGRAPHY OF FOOD-SUPPLEMENTED POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN YUKON, 1976-84	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) We studied the population dynamics of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in the Kluane Lake region of the Yukon by live-trapping nine areas year-round. We provided rabbit chow as winter food to three of these populations from September to May, 1977 to 1984. (2) Peak densities were reached in 1980 and 1981 on all areas except Jacquot Island. Two areas with extra winter food maintained densities three times of their controls, while one food-supplemented area on Jacquot Island showed little effect of improved feeding on hare density. (3) Supplementary food did not prevent the cyclic decline and all areas reachedlow densities by 1984. The beginning of the decline was delayed 6 months on one food area but not delayed on the other. (4) The amplitude of the cycle was 141-fold based on spring numbers and 268-fold based on August numbers. This is considerably higher than the amplitudes measured in Minnesota and Alberta. (5) The hare cycle was caused by changes in recruitment (probably determined by losses during the first 8 weeks of life), juvenile survival in autumn, and adult survival in autumn. Survival rates gradually decreased during the cycle, and were lowest in its decline phase. (6) Extra winter food did not prevent the drop in survival that occurs during the decline phase of the hare cycle, nor did it prevent the low recruitment rate that occurs during the decline.

Rainbow trout were 1.3 mm in size or larger. Trout predation upon D. pulex occurred mainly during winter and early spring when their numbers were relatively low but their clutch size high, suggesting that trout selected Daphnia on the basis of brood pigmentation. By far the greatest proportion of Daphnia mortality was due to nonpredatory sources, since generally less than 6% could be attributed to trout predation. The D. pulex population exhibited a bimodal seasonal abundance curve which was attributed to ephippial egg production and trout predation during the winter and poor food quality/quantity during the summer.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	71	3					277	287		10.1007/BF00686135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00686135													WOS:A1980KB14800010

Aquatic habitat response to climate-driven hydrologic regimes and water operations in a montane reservoir in the Pacific Northwest, USA	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Freshwater systems are progressively becoming more stressed with increased human demands combined with expected trends in climate, which can threaten native biota and potentially destabilize the ecosystem. Numerical models allow water managers to evaluate the combined effects of climate and water management on the biogeochemical processes thereby identifying opportunities to optimize water management to protect ecosystem function, biodiversity and associated services. We used a 3D hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with an aquatic ecosystem dynamic model (CAEDYM) to compare two scenarios across three climatic and hydrologic conditions (extreme wet, extreme dry and average) for Deadwood Reservoir (USA). Additionally, we collected water temperature, water chemistry and biological data from the reservoir and inflowing tributaries to validate the model, as well as migration and growth data from Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) the top predator of the food web. Modeled scenarios identified that reducing minimum outflows from 1.4 to 0.06 m(3) s(-1) during the fall and winter months resulted in higher reservoir elevations and cooler water temperatures the following year, which extended reservoir rearing during the summer and fall seasons. The scenarios with reduced stream flow during the fall and winter seasons indicate benefits to the reservoir ecosystem, particularly during dry years, and could reduce the effects of climatic warming.

In this study, roadside swales were constructed and studied as a trap for pollutants leached from an experimental road. Soil from the slopes and bottoms of the swales was sampled twice yearly (in spring and autumn) and analysed for metal content. Common plant species in Northern Sweden were planted and a grass mixture was sowed in the swales. The aerial plant parts were sampled in the autumn and analysed for Cu, Cr, Ph, and Zn. One season of observations did not reveal any significant effect of the road on the soil and plants. The metal concentrations in the soil of the swales varied insignificantly between the samples collected in the spring and autumn. Metal concentration in the soil did not exceed the generic guideline values for Swedish contaminated soils. ne dry summer of 2002 could have hindered the formation of ash leachate from the road. As the soil proper-ties (pH, metal content) of all studied swale sections remained unaltered, a lack of humidity might be the reason for the observed poor plant establishment in the experimental and reference swales. The impact of the road material on the soil quality started to show up during the second season (2003). Slopes of the experimental swale became contaminated with Cu. Yet the metal translocation from grassed swales through the trophic chain is unlikely; in soil containing higher concentrations of metals grew vegetation with lower metal uptake.																					0-387-25865-5				2006							87	+		10.1007/0-387-32177-2_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/0-387-32177-2_9													WOS:000235259800009

To improve the understanding of regional differences in water availability throughout the region and to refine the existing information on precipitation variability, this study investigated the spatial pattern of precipitation for the Lake Urmia basin. Daily rainfall time series from 122 precipitation stations with different record lengths were used to extract 15 statistical descriptors comprising 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and coefficient of variation for annual and seasonal total precipitation. Principal component analysis in association with cluster analysis identified three main homogeneous precipitation groups in the lake basin. The first sub-region (group 1) includes stations located in the center and southeast; the second sub-region (group 2) covers mostly northern and northeastern part of the basin, and the third sub-region (group 3) covers the western and southern edges of the basin. Results of principal component (PC) and clustering analyses showed that seasonal precipitation variation is the most important feature controlling the spatial pattern of precipitation in the lake basin. The 25th and 75th percentiles of winter and autumn are the most important variables controlling the spatial pattern of the first rotated principal component explaining about 32% of the total variance. Summer and spring precipitation variations are the most important variables in the second and third rotated principal components, respectively. Seasonal variation in precipitation amount and seasonality are explained by topography and influenced by the lake and westerly winds that are related to the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.

Adult non-biting midges emerge from waterbodies and swarm in high numbers, occasionally disrupting people's outdoor activities. In order to understand the seasonal dynamics of species composition, a continuous observation of non-biting midge diversity was performed. Adult non-biting midges were collected using light traps from the autumn of 2022 to the summer of 2023 in an urban wetland park. Species were identified based on morphological characteristics and DNA barcodes. Alpha diversity was evaluated using Margalef, Pielou, and Shannon-Wiener indexes. Beta diversity was evaluated using unconstrained NMDS analysis and constrained CCA. The impacts of environmental factors, including barometric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, on the variation in species composition were estimated in the constrained analyses. A total of 42 species were identified, with 29 species belonging to Chironominae, 9 species belonging to Orthocladiinae, and 4 species belonging to Tanypodinae. The species composition varied across different seasons. Summer sites and autumn sites shared the highest similarity in diversity, and spring sites presented the lowest diversity. The variation was significantly correlated with environmental conditions. The results showed that seasonality is a factor influencing the diversity of adult non-biting midges.					; Chen, Yuqiu/ISS-3603-2023; Lei, Teng/JEZ-8228-2023	Lei, Teng/0000-0003-0201-8119; Song, Chao/0000-0002-8981-2296; 														2075-4450				DEC	2024	15	12							921	10.3390/insects15120921	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects15120921								39769523					WOS:001384966300001

Results indicate strong influence of the seawater exchange and circulation, on the organic matter accumulation inside the lagoon, visible through a significant correlation between TOC and salinity in both seasons. Two times higher concentration of TOC (up to 5.5 mg/l) was recorded in autumn, when high salinity water (46 ps mu) was present in the lagoon. POC made a relatively small percentage of TOC in autumn samples when high accumulation of TOC, especially its DOC fraction can be related to remineralization processes and zooplankton-mediated release of DOC. Indeed, PCA analysis identified DOC as the most significant factor influencing the observed variability in autumn samples, and correlated to NH4+ thorn (p < 0.05) in surface waters, while POC was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to chlorophyll a. During spring, organic matter in the lagoon was depth-dependent and under the high influence of salinity and temperature, and in the surface correlated to NO3-. Satellite data on lagoon water optical properties appear to support changes in measured organic matter concentrations indicating different optical properties of the water inside the lagoon during spring and autumn seasons. The ocean color remote sensing, with properly validated and tested robust algorithms, accommodating optically shallow waters, can provide valuable tools for monitoring and timely detection of possibly detrimental changes inside the lagoon.

Length of larval life cycle was about 18 months in the lake outlet and 27 months in the forested stream. Small larvae appeared in late autumn and early winter (April-June) in both streams, and the main period of emergence began in late winter (August-September) and spring (October-November) in the forested and lake outlet streams, respectively. Production estimated by the size-frequency method was 3.62 g DW m-2 yr-1 in the lake outlet and 2.42 g DW m-2 yr-1 in the forested stream. Mean annual biomass was slightly higher in the forested stream (1.43 cf. 1.0 g DW m-2 yr-1). The higher production in the lake outlet was primarily a consequence of the faster growth rate of individuals. This in turn reflected the higher water temperature of the lake outlet (approximately 3050 cf. 2610 degree days above 0-degrees-C), particularly in spring.																			0028-8330						1993	27	4					445	451		10.1080/00288330.1993.9516586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1993.9516586													WOS:A1993MY93500007

The Jaccard co-efficient was used to investigate inter-waterbody similarities, and correspondence analysis (CA) was used to determine variation between waterbodies by month and by year. The same pairings of waterbodies were most similar, and dissimilar, during summer and winter, according to both methods. CA characterized waterbody usage according to trophic category, seasonality and foraging method guilds. Spring-summer was the most dynamic period for the waterbird community. Major environmental events that occurred during the study did not cause significant changes at community level.

Chlorophyll-a concentration is one of the most important indices of water eutrophication. This paper builds seasonal chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval models using a semi-analytical model. Quarterly distributions of chlorophyll-a concentration from 2009 to 2012 are explored using multi-spectra data from a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The correlation coefficient of the retrieval models primarily ranged from 0.6 to 0.9. The results show that the chlorophyll-a concentration in Poyang Lake has significant seasonality characteristics that present low values in the winter and spring, and present relatively high values in the summer and autumn; this report also presents an obvious, increasing trend of inter-annual variability from 2009 to 2012. The spatial distribution of the chlorophyll-a concentration has regional differences that give relatively high values adjacent to the shore in the north area of Poyang Lake, in the flow in river entries, and in the main channel area in the central and south areas of Poyang Lake. The natural hydrology features have a close relationship with the variation in the chlorophyll-a concentration. Intensive human activities are the main driving forces for the increasing chlorophyll-a concentration.

The amount of snowfall in snowy areas is anticipated to decline because of global climate change. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of changes in the inflow of snowmelt on the nutrient concentrations of a downstream brackish lake. In Lake Ogawara, a brackish lake in a snow-covered agricultural area of Japan, we examined the relationships between inflowing river discharge (D/C) during spring and total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the mixolimnion of the lake ([TNmix] and [TPmix], respectively) using 29 yr of monitoring data. In addition, we assessed the causal relationship between the D/C and the lake nutrient concentrations. There was large year-to-year variation in D/C during April (D/C-Apr), which accounted for 7-31% of the mixolimnion volume. Significant positive correlations were observed between D/C-Apr and [TNmix] from the ensuing April to September. On an annual basis, 49% of the interannual variation of the mean [TNmix] during the ensuing April to September was explained by the interannual variation of D/C-Apr. Therefore, D/C-Apr could be useful as a simple index to [TNmix] in the ensuing spring to summer. It is notable that the relationships between D/C Apr and [TNmix] from April to September was indicated to be acausal by statistical causal inference. Common climate conditions that increase D/C-Apr (i.e., a cold winter with a high level of precipitation) were found to drive other biogeochemical processes that increased [TNmix] during the ensuing spring to summer.					; Maie, Nagamitsu/AAC-2487-2019	Maie, Nagamitsu/0000-0001-9450-061X; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2020	49	1					119	127		10.1002/jeq2.20033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.20033								33016350					WOS:000526516900011

Proteocephalus singularis was also recovered from a bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus (a new host record). One thousand eight hundred twelve fishes from 32 species from both lakes and 1,543 fishes from 27 species from connected waters were examined. Many larval forms of Proteocephalus, including P. ambloplitis (Leidy, 1887), are also reported from 10 species of fish. Proteocephalus percae appears to represent a new geographic record in North America. The most common species was P. pinguis. This tapeworm was considerably larger than previous descriptions indicate and was equally abundant in both lakes surveyed. It was more common in males than females and in older than younger Esox. Recruitment occurred in late summer and autumn, development in winter, and sexual maturity and reproduction in the spring. The infectious cycle in the definitive host was from August-September to April-May and in the intermediate host was during the summer. No seasonal migration was observed. For the most part, worms established, developed, matured, and reproduced in the anterior part of the small intestine. The helminth fauna of E. lucius in southeastern Wisconsin is considered poor compared to that of the same host in more northern latitudes. The ony other helminth parasites recovered were Leptorhynchoides thecatus (rare), Camallanus oxycephalus (rare), and Neoechinorhynchus cylindratus (more common). This is the first report of the seasonal ecology of P. pinguis in North America.																			1049-233X					JUL	1990	57	2					132	139																WOS:A1990DT06200006

Dissolved and particulate phosphorus concentration and export patterns in headwater streams draining Boreal Plain watersheds one year after experimental forest harvest and post-harvest silvicultural activities	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE												This study examined total dissolved (TDP) and particulate phosphorus (PP) concentration and export in nine headwater streams draining Boreal Plain forests in Alberta, Canada, during the growing season and autumn before and in the first year after winter harvest in four of the watersheds. Mechanical and chemical site preparation was also conducted before and during the post-harvest sampling period. During the growing season, TDP and PP concentrations in streams draining harvested watersheds were higher than in the reference streams at storm peaks (P <= 0.08) and along the falling limbs of storm flows (P <= 0.03). We postulate that forestry activities enhanced TDP leaching from watershed soils after they became saturated. This promoted the growth of periphyton in streams, which subsequently sloughed off during high flows. In autumn, TDP concentrations were higher in streams draining harvested watersheds along the rising limb, at the storm peaks, and along the falling limbs (P <= 0.05). However, PP concentrations in autumn were similar in harvested and reference streams along the rising limb (P = 0.19) and were lower in harvested streams at the storm peaks and along the falling limbs (P <= 0.08). No differences in TDP or PP concentration were detected between harvested and reference streams during baseflow-dominated periods. Mean TDP and PP export coefficients tended to be higher in the post-harvest than pre-harvest year in both reference and harvested watersheds. After normalization to precipitation inputs, this change ("impact ratio") was 153% and 130% higher in harvested than reference watersheds for TDP and PP, respectively (P <= 0.08). The TDP impact ratio and percent of the watershed area cut were positively related (r(2) = 0.95, P = 0.02). A 30 m riparian buffer strip in two harvested watersheds did not appear to reduce the harvest response.																			1496-2551	1496-256X					2008	7			1			S63	S77		10.1139/S08-030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/S08-030													WOS:000207536400007

No evidence of infectious disease was diagnosed during necropsies of geese. Brain ChE activities were depressed up to 77% below normal. Parathion residues in GI tract contents of geese ranged from 4 to 34 ppm. Based on this evidence, parathion was responsible for the goose mortalities. Parathion applications to winter wheat will undoubtedly increase if parathion is applied for control of both Russian wheat aphids and greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum). Geese may potentially be exposed to widespread applications of parathion from fall to spring, essentially their entire wintering period.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				APR	1991	27	2					265	268		10.7589/0090-3558-27.2.265	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-27.2.265								2067047					WOS:A1991FJ64400011
J	TIPPETT, R				TIPPETT, R			AN INVESTIGATION INTO NATURE OF LAYERING OF DEEP-WATER SEDIMENTS IN TWO EASTERN ONTARIO LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The sediments deposited beneath the thermocline in certain lakes are finely banded with alternating dark and light bands. Most workers have assumed this banding to be an annual phenomenon, with the light bands representing summer deposits and the dark bands representing winter deposits. The microfossils contained in each layer, particularly pollen and diatoms, should represent the flora of the time of year at which the sediment was deposited. If this banding is annual, different species will be consistently associated with particular parts of a pair of layers. Pollen and diatom contents of individually separated dark and light layers from different depths of a core were analyzed. Pollen produced in late spring and early summer, and summer forms of diatoms, are associated with light layers whereas pollen produced early in the year, and winter diatoms, are associated with dark layers. The junction between layer types and the position of fossils in each layer were studied by observing sections cut from wax impregnated sediment blocks. The light layers contain much more calcareous material than the dark layers. From all evidence accumulated it is concluded that the layering is annual.																									1964	42	12					1693	+		10.1139/b64-168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b64-168													WOS:A19646017300010
J	GERVAIS, F				GERVAIS, F			WHICH FACTORS CONTROLLED SEASONAL AND SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON SPECIES IN SCHLACHTENSEE (BERLIN, FRG) 1987	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Proceeding from the assumption introduced by REYNOLDS (1984 b) that phytoplankton periodicity is the result of "morphologically-, physiologically- and behaviourally-mediated responses of algal populations" to autogenic and allogenic growth and loss factors, the present paper attempts to explain phytoplankton dynamics in Schlachtensee 1987. For this purpose, causal connections between the seasonality of algal populations and of important environmental factors in Schlachtensee are shown, and seasonality is compared with the observations, experiments and hypotheses of other investigations. The spring maximum of algal biomass was dominated by cryptophytes and large diatoms, the first profiting by their winter inoculum, the latter by their high photosynthetic efficiency and capacity. Crustacean grazing, as well as Si-limitation of biomass and sedimentation probably led to the decline of the spring populations. These were followed by two populations of large colonial chrysophytes that profited by mobility, independence of higher Si-concentrations, efficient phosphate uptake and the ability to grow mixotrophically. Grazing and a temporary increase in pH-values might have caused the decline of these chrysophyte populations. In summer, large populations of inedible Ceratium spp., that, by diel vertical migration, might have derived benefit from the exploitation of nutrients concentrated in the hypolimnion, dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. Increasing mixing depth prevented vertical migration and decreased the effective light climate, thus leading to the breakdown of the Ceratium populations. With the replenishment of silicon as a result of full overturn in autumn, a large diatom, Fragilaria crotonensis, prevailed in Schlachtensee until the decline in global radiation led to the winter minimum of phytoplankton biomass. In Schlachtensee, considerable vertical inequality of phytoplankton biomass and assemblage composition was observed as a result of slow sedimentation of diatoms, of vertical migration of flagellates and of hypolimnetic growth of Cryptomonas spp. The comparison of two lake basins showed no fundamental horizontal differences in periodicity of phytoplankton biovolume and species composition in 1987. Significant changes in phytoplankton biomass, species composition and periodicity have occurred with increasing success of restoration in Schlachtensee.																			0003-9136					MAR	1991	121	1					43	65																WOS:A1991FJ50900003
J	STEMBERGER, RS; EVANS, MS				STEMBERGER, RS; EVANS, MS			ROTIFER SEASONAL SUCCESSION AND COPEPOD PREDATION IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phytoplankton and zooplankton population dynamics in southeastern Lake Michigan provide indirect evidence that selective Cyclops predation and food resource levels are important determinants of rotifer species succession. The spring rotifer community, dominated by the soft-bodied Synchaeta, declined in abundance by late spring and was succeeded by a summer assemblage dominated by spiny (Kellicottia, Keratella) and colonial (Conochilus) rotifers, and then by an autumn assemblage of spiny rotifers and the soft-bodied, evasive-swimming Polyarthra vulgaris. In contrast to Synchaeta, these latter forms are resistant to predation by Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, the major invertebrate predator in the study area. The density of Synchaeta was negatively correlated with the population density of late instar C. bicuspidatus thomasi and positively correlated with standing stocks of flagellates and small, non-flagellate (< 30 .mu.m on one dimension) phytoplankton. Cyclops predation and food resource levels probably were important factors affecting the abundance of this genus. Conservative estimates of predation mortality of Synchaeta by Cyclops can account for most of the estimated population death rates during spring and early summer when Synchaeta abundances declined markedly. The population dynamics of rotifers resistant to Cyclops predation, especially Keratella cochlearis and Kellicottia longispina, were positively correlated with Cyclops populations, suggesting that abundances of these populations were not predation-limited. A high correlation between egg ratios of these resistant species and phytoplankton standing stocks was found. No significant correlation was observed between estimated death rates of resistant species and Cyclops abundance, suggesting that population dynamics of these predation-resistant species were more affected by food resources than by cyclopoid predation.

A first step toward a full appreciation of Lake Michigan's carbon cycle is to quantify the dominant mechanisms of its internal carbon cycle. To achieve this, we use the MIT general circulation model configured to the bathymetry of Lake Michigan and coupled to an ecosystem model to simulate the seasonal cycle of productivity, temperature, circulation, and the partial pressure of CO2 in water (pCO(2)). This biogeochemistry is designed to be appropriate for the prequagga mussel state of the lake. The primary mechanism behind the seasonal cycle of primary productivity is lake physics. The offshore spring phytoplankton bloom begins following a reduction in deep vertical mixing and ends with the depletion of nutrients via thermal stratification. The exception is the western shoreline, where summer winds drive coastal upwelling, providing hypolimnetic nutrients and generating significant productivity. Surface pCO(2) is controlled by the net effect from temperature on solubility, and is modulated by biological uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and isothermal mixing of DIC-rich water in winter. Temperature tends to have the greatest seasonal impact in nearshore regions, while local DIC has the greatest impact in offshore regions. Lakewide, the model suggests that carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere during the spring bloom and released to the atmosphere during winter mixing and when summer surface temperatures are at their maximum.

Some investigators have suggested that some individuals overwinter in shallow waters, but the ecology and life history of such nonmigratory populations are poorly understood. We developed a species-specific environmental DNA (eDNA) marker to detect P. paucidens in water samples and used it to examine the distribution and relative abundance of overwintering individuals in the shallow waters of Lake Biwa. Water samples were collected from 21 shore sites and 32 surrounding freshwater lagoons of Lake Biwa in November 2015 and February 2016. In November, 4 shore and 12 freshwater lagoon sites were positive for P. paucidens eDNA, and in February, 4 shore and 9 freshwater lagoon sites were positive. The relative abundance of eDNA copies was estimated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Simultaneous sampling of P. paucidens and its eDNA, conducted at the inlet and outlet of 5 freshwater lagoons in December 2016, validated our method as a quantitative measure of the relative abundance of P. paucidens local populations. The eDNA approach used here confirmed that some P. paucidens individuals overwinter in the shallow waters, suggesting life-history diversity in Lake Biwa populations.					; Wu, Qianqian/AIE-3397-2022; Minamoto, Toshifumi/C-6453-2009	Wu, Qianqian/0000-0002-8402-4055; Minamoto, Toshifumi/0000-0002-5379-1622													2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2018	37	2					307	314		10.1086/697542	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/697542													WOS:000432253900010
J	Shatwell, T; Adrian, R; Kirillin, G				Shatwell, Tom; Adrian, Rita; Kirillin, Georgiy			Planktonic events may cause polymictic-dimictic regime shifts in temperate lakes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Water transparency affects the thermal structure of lakes, and within certain lake depth ranges, it can determine whether a lake mixes regularly (polymictic regime) or stratifies continuously (dimictic regime) from spring through summer. Phytoplankton biomass can influence transparency but the effect of its seasonal pattern on stratification is unknown. Therefore we analysed long term field data from two lakes of similar depth, transparency and climate but one polymictic and one dimictic, and simulated a conceptual lake with a hydrodynamic model. Transparency in the study lakes was typically low during spring and summer blooms and high in between during the clear water phase (CWP), caused when zooplankton graze the spring bloom. The effect of variability of transparency on thermal structure was stronger at intermediate transparency and stronger during a critical window in spring when the rate of lake warming is highest. Whereas the spring bloom strengthened stratification in spring, the CWP weakened it in summer. The presence or absence of the CWP influenced stratification duration and under some conditions determined the mixing regime. Therefore seasonal plankton dynamics, including biotic interactions that suppress the CWP, can influence lake temperatures, stratification duration, and potentially also the mixing regime.

Within 14 days of treatment, chlorophyll a concentrations [Chla] decreased to less than half the values measured just prior to treatment; there was no short-term trend in total phosphorus concentrations, [P]T. Chla returned to pretreatment concentrations within 35 days of treatment. Although dissolved oxygen concentrations were very low in the autumn and first winter following lime treatments, under-ice [P]T were less than half pretreatment values. During the summer following the first lime treatments, [P]T, [Chla], and water clarity improved relative to the other five summers on record; average [P]T decreased to 30% and [Chla] decreased to 12% of the previous summer''s values. The following winter, dissolved oxygen depletion rates were 59% of pretreatment rates. The short-term reduction in [Chla] was likely related to precipitation of growth-limiting nutrients other than phosphorus, such as iron, with the calcite. In contrast, improvements in [Chla] the year following the first lime treatments could be related to lower [P]T in the water column, as a consequence of increased P-binding capacity of bottom sediments. Lime treatments can enhance water quality in eutrophic hard-water lakes by suppression of growth-limiting nutrients for phytoplankton.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG	1990	24	8					1252	1258		10.1021/es00078a014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00078a014													WOS:A1990DQ69900023

We have studied water survival of seven C. jejuni and eight C. coli isolates originally isolated from Swedish waters, together with selected reference strains, over eight days at 4 degrees C in the dark in untreated water collected from a local lake and a private well. To study seasonality, lake water samples were collected during spring and autumn. Samples for culturable bacterial counts were taken on days 2,4,6, and 8 and compared to the start inoculum. For C. jejuni, a significantly better survival was observed in autumn than in spring lake water. Furthermore, C. jejuni had a significantly better survival than C. coli in autumn lake and well water samples; the rate of culturability loss was almost double for C. coli in autumn lake water. These findings contribute to a better understanding on the seasonality of waterborne Campylobacter infections and the general predominance of C. jejuni.

On the one hand, this is a rather well-known phenomenon; on the other hand, it is not sufficiently studied, although it has a significant impact on the thermal regime in winter and water dynamics during the periods of formation and breakdown of inverse temperature stratification. Our work presents the results of analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of the main MTML parameters and their dependence on hydrometeorological factors. For this purpose, CTD soundings and mooring data obtained in the western part of the southern basin of Lake Baikal in 2000-2022 were analyzed in comparison to ERA5-Land reanalysis. The MTML parameters have noticeable within-season and interannual spatial and temporal variability. This is obviously related to the influence of the processes of vertical turbulent mixing, internal wave action, and current patterns. The analysis of interannual differences revealed four types of behavior of the maximum MTML temperature during the ice season. The influence of wind conditions on the main MTML parameters (maximum MTML temperature, depth of its occurrence, and depth of the upper MTML boundary) was shown not only in the fall, but also in the summer period, when heat accumulation in the Baikal water column takes place. With the increased wind activity in the late fall, the MTML is formed deeper and has lower maximum temperature values. At lower wind activity in the fall, the MTML is closer to the surface and the values of the maximum MTML temperature are higher. A change in wind activity in the summer leads to the opposite effect. In spite of the essential trends over the study period in the dates of the occurrence of hydrological events, no noticeable trends were registered for the maximum MTML temperature, its depth, and the depth of the upper boundary of the MTML.

Snow-dominated mountain lakes are abundant and highly susceptible to climate warming, yet we lack an understanding of how climate variation and local attributes influence winter processes. We investigated climatic and intrinsic controls on ice phenology, water temperature, and bottom-water dissolved oxygen (DO) in 15 morphologically diverse lakes in the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains of California, USA, using high-frequency measurements from multiple (2-5) winters. We found that ice phenology was determined by winter climate variables (snowfall and air temperature) that influence ice-off timing, whereas ice-on timing was relatively invariant among years. Lake size and morphology mediated the effect of climate on lake temperature and DO dynamics in early and late winter. Rates of hypolimnetic DO decline were highest in small, shallow lakes, and were unrelated to water temperature. Temperature and oxygen dynamics were more variable in small lakes because heavy snowfall caused ice submergence, mixing, and DO replenishment that affected the entire water column. As the persistence of snow declines in temperate mountain regions, autumn, and spring climatic conditions are expected to gain importance in regulating lake ice phenology. Water temperature and DO will likely increase in most lakes during winter as snowpack declines, but morphological attributes such as lake size will determine the sensitivity of ice phenology and under-ice processes to climate change.

J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Ye, R; Yao, J; Tan, ZQ				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Ye, Rui; Yao, Jing; Tan, Zhiqiang			3D hydrodynamic investigation of thermal regime in a large river-lake-floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Thermal regime and its response to meteorological and hydrological forcings play an important role in controlling water quality and ecosystem of lakes. Many large floodplain lakes are subjected to significant river-lake interactions and could benefit greatly from hydrodynamic modeling. The current work presents a first attempt to use a 3D hydrodynamic model and statistical methods to explore spatiotemporal variations and primary causal factors of thermal stability within a large river-lake-floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China). The hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics through a comparative analysis of field measurements. Simulation results revealed that the thermal stability of Poyang Lake exhibits similar spatial patterns between seasons; however, the lake is generally stratified during summer and early autumn. It is classified as partial mixed and full mixed during winter and spring. The thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay area of the lake, while the full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels. Statistics and simulations indicate that the air temperature, solar radiation and evaporation trigger a positive effect on the thermal stability of Poyang Lake, whereas a negative relationship is recognized due to the catchment river temperature. The responses of thermal stability to the meteorological and hydrological changes are much stronger in summer than other seasons, producing a significant seasonal thermal regime in the floodplain lake. Additionally, the dynamics in the lake water depth and associated hydrological regime are a major factor in maintaining the seasonal thermal stability of Poyang Lake. The findings of this study can support management of Poyang Lake as well as other similar floodplain lakes, by providing information on both water quality and ecosystem succession.

Particular macrophyte species may differ in shape, length and width of stems, in the surface structure, which is particularly important for the attached epiphytic algae, and also in spatial orientation of stems or the way of rooting and biomass. Periphyton samples were collected from two ecological types of water vegetation represented by emerged macrophytes reeds Typha angustifolia/Phragmites australis, and submerged macrophytes - stoneworts Chara tomentosa. Three lakes Wielkowiejskie, Budzyliskie, Debiniec of similar morphometry - small and shallow were chosen for this examination. These typically macrophyte-dominated lakes were characterised by classically developed pattern of water and rush vegetation. The samples were collected three times in 2003, including the spring, summer and autumn seasons. As a result of the investigation 283 taxa of epiphytic algae and cyanoprokaxyotes were identified in the three lakes. Most species belonged to Bacillariophyceae, which were followed by Chlorophyta and Cyanoprokaryota. Two trends in the total densities of periphytic communities different for the Chara and Typha habitats were distinguished. In the Chara bed the continuous increase in the numbers was observed from spring to autumn, while in the rush zone the abundance peak was observed in the summer. Additionally, it was found that Chlorophyta had significantly higher densities as well as biomass among Chara tomentosa. The differences in the community composition and algal number of cells on various plant hosts may be a result of differences in macrophyte architecture and a combination of physico-chemical and biological factors, e.g., the texture of particular water plants, the effect of allelopathy or grazing activity of invertebrates.					; Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022; Celewicz, Sofia/Q-9399-2018	Messyasz, Beata/0000-0002-4371-3591; Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia/0000-0002-0513-9461; Celewicz, Sofia/0000-0003-2033-2777													0006-3088	1336-9563				JUL	2005	60	4					349	355																WOS:000232053000004

Due to its geographic position, SW Central Asia is a key locality for identifying fluctuations of westerlies, Siberian High and SW monsoon. Yet, there is only limited information on the Pleistocene climate history in SW Central Asia. Here we use plant-wax biomarkers and their hydrogen isotope (delta D) composition from a loess section in Darai Kalon, southern Tajikistan, to reconstruct environmental conditions of the past 250 thousand years (ka). We focus on the hydrogen isotope composition of long-chain n-alkanes (delta D-Alk) and long-chain n-carboxylic acids (delta D-carb) to reconstruct changes in the hydrological system. Moreover, we infer information about past vegetation changes from proxies based on the relative abundance of these compounds. Results show that during glacials, grasses dominated whereas during interglacials arboreal species prevailed. These changes in vegetation follow the dominant glacial-interglacial variability visible in the loess stratigraphy. Our results are in line with decreased precipitation during glacials as a result of a more extensive Siberian High. Isotope measurements reveal a close relation of delta D-Alk and delta D-carb with insolation, controlled by 20 ka cycles of orbital precession that is distinct from the glacial-interglacial variability of the loess stratigraphy. Depleted (enriched) delta D-Alk and delta D-carb values coincide with low (high) winter-spring insolation. The precessional mode of our isotope records is likely influenced by variations in the precipitation seasonality between winter and spring precipitation caused by insolation-induced temperature changes. In comparison with speleothem records along the westerly path, our results further indicate that the winter westerly storm tracks did not extend to the east of the Tian Shan during the last two glacial cycles.

During winter (October-December), the average temperature was 8.76 degrees C +/- 11.43 degrees C, with 7.01 mm rainfall, while summer (May-September) averaged 23.24 degrees C +/- 6.2 degrees C with 5.2 mm rainfall. Despite seasonal variations, the pH levels remained consistent. Phosphorus removal by the WWTP was efficient, with the winter influent averaging 4.16 +/- 5.53 mg/L, the winter effluent averaging 0.33 +/- 1.06 mg/L, the summer influent averaging 3.53 +/- 2.9 mg/L, and the summer effluent averaging 0.31 +/- 0.75 mg/L. The COD and BOD5 levels showed seasonal trends, with a higher winter-influent COD (450.43 +/- 560.56 mg/L) than in summer (410.96 +/- 302 mg/L). These higher winter values of effluent may be due to lower biological activity at cooler temperatures, affecting the efficiency of organic matter breakdown and treatment. The winter influent BOD averaged 249.57 +/- 220.42 mg/L, with the winter effluent being 2.95 +/- 2.04 mg/L, while the summer influent BOD was 214.44 +/- 345.5 mg/L and the summer effluent was 3.01 +/- 7.5 mg/L. The TSSs and Total-N showed similar seasonal patterns, with there being slight decreases in the TSSs removal efficiency during warmer months. Although microplastic pollution was not directly analyzed in this study, wastewater treatment plants play a crucial role in mitigating microplastic contamination. Despite rainfall influencing the phosphorus and organic load concentrations, the studied plant maintained over 90% pollutant removal efficiency, demonstrating resilience and compliance with regulatory standards.

Migrants employ mixed strategies to route across the Great Lakes basin	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Millions of migrants encounter the Great Lakes during spring and autumn migratory movements. How migrants behave when encountering these lakes is relatively unknown at the local and basin scales. Using seven years of radar data from 33 sites along the Great Lakes coastline, we investigated three hypotheses on migrant behavior during crepuscular and nocturnal movements. First, we hypothesized migrants' direction is driven by local geography and its relation to the destination of migration. Second, we hypothesized migrants would move toward shore at dawn. Finally, we hypothesized that the Great Lakes would have different directional movements at lakes on the outside of the basin versus the interior. We found partial support for our first hypothesis, as well as evidence of decision making when migrants first encounter the Great Lakes. We found partial support for our second hypothesis. We found that migrants moved toward land at elevated levels at dawn compared to night during fall migration, but no effect was found during spring. We found support for our final hypothesis during spring migration, but not during fall. This pattern may be because of a combination of geographical, biological, and data bias, and will require additional work to disentangle. Taken together, we found that migrants perceive and react to the Great Lakes, and attempt to decrease risk, perceived or real, as they make their way to their migratory destination. Better understanding of directional movement has conservation implications, including mitigating anthropogenic obstacle collision risk and prioritizing stopover habitat restoration.

Study focus: Bridging the gap between atmospheric influences and aquatic environments, this study embarked on a comprehensive reconstruction of daily surface water temperatures across lakes and rivers within the Pannonian Ecoregion over an extensive period of 150 years (1870-2021). New hydrological insights for the region: The analysis revealed a clear warming trend in waters over the past 150 years, and majority of this warming occurred in recent three to four decades (average warming rate: 0.317 degrees C/decade). Seasonal patterns indicated that winter and spring exhibited faster warming rates, followed by autumn and summer. There has been a significant increase in the number, duration, and intensity of heatwaves in both lakes and rivers, particularly pronounced in the last 30-40 years, and with the rise of air temperatures, river and lake heatwaves tend to intensity. These findings underscore the escalating impact of climate change on freshwater systems in the Pannonian Ecoregion, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation measures. As the first study on river and lake heatwaves in Hungary and one of the few studies on river heatwaves worldwide, this study will provide reference for analysing extreme thermal events in aquatic systems.

Atmospheric deposition as a source of carbon and nutrients to an alpine catchment of the Colorado Rocky Mountains	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Many alpine areas are experiencing deglaciation, biogeochemical changes driven by temperature rise, and changes in atmospheric deposition. There is mounting evidence that the water quality of alpine streams may be related to these changes, including rising atmospheric deposition of carbon (C) and nutrients. Given that barren alpine soils can be severely C limited, atmospheric deposition sources may be an important source of C and nutrients for these environments. We evaluated the magnitude of atmospheric deposition of C and nutrients to an alpine site, the Green Lake 4 catchment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Using a long-term dataset (2002-2010) of weekly atmospheric wet deposition and snowpack chemistry, we found that volume weighted mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were 1.12 +/- 0.19 mg l(-1), and weekly concentrations reached peaks as high at 6-10 mg l(-1) every summer. Total dissolved nitrogen concentration also peaked in the summer, whereas total dissolved phosphorus and calcium concentrations were highest in the spring. To investigate potential sources of C in atmospheric deposition, we evaluated the chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and relationships between DOM and other solutes in wet deposition. Relationships between DOC concentration, fluorescence, and nitrate and sulfate concentrations suggest that pollutants from nearby urban and agricultural sources and organic aerosols derived from sub-alpine vegetation may influence high summer DOC wet deposition concentrations. Interestingly, high DOC concentrations were also recorded during 'dust-in-snow' events in the spring, which may reflect an association of DOM with dust. Detailed chemical and spectroscopic analyses conducted for samples collected in 2010 revealed that the DOM in many late spring and summer samples was less aromatic and polydisperse and of lower molecular weight than that of winter and fall samples. Our C budget estimates for the Green Lake 4 catchment illustrated that wet deposition (9.9 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and dry deposition (6.9 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) were a combined input of approximately 17 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), which could be as high as 24 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in high dust years. This atmospheric C input approached the C input from microbial autotrophic production in barren soils. Atmospheric wet and dry deposition also contributed 4.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 0.15 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), and 2.7 kg Ca2+ ha(-1) yr(-1) to this alpine catchment.

Marbled Godwit migration characterized with satellite telemetry	CONDOR												Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa) breed in 3 disparate areas: The majority breed in the prairies of midcontinental North America, but there are also 2 small and widely separated tundra-breeding populations, 1 in eastern Canada and 1 on the Alaska Peninsula, USA. The major winter ranges include the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts of the USA and Mexico. Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge at Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA, is a major stopover site, hosting large godwit populations in the spring and fall. Although the distributions of Marbled Godwit populations and their habitats across the landscape are generally known, the linkages between them are not. We tracked 23 Marbled Godwits equipped with satellite transmitters from sites in Utah, Mexico, Canada, and coastal Georgia during 2006-2010. Our goals were to characterize the migration strategy of Marbled Godwit populations and to determine migratory connectivity of major breeding, staging, and wintering areas. We found that: 1) godwits breeding in the western USA and Canada followed an overland route to winter sites in Mexico after departing their Utah stopover site; 2) godwits tagged in eastern Canada migrated across the continental USA and wintered at sites along the Gulf of California, Mexico; and 3) godwits wintering in coastal Georgia bred in North and South Dakota. We believe this to be the first demonstration of a continental "crisscross" migration pattern in a shorebird. We identified differences in migration elements such as distances traveled, timing of migration, duration, residency, and stopover strategy between the subpopulations, but not between males and females.

Effects of groundwater fluctuations on the distribution and population structure of two cyprinid fishes in a desert spring complex	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Relationships between groundwater levels, surface water levels, and the distribution and habitat use of two cyprinid fishes, Least Chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis) and Utah Chub (Gila atraria), were examined at a spring complex in the Snake Valley of the Great Basin, USA to test the hypothesis that the distribution and structure of fish populations in the spring complex is regulated by the influence of shallow groundwater levels on the depth and distribution of surface water and the availability of suitable spawning and juvenile habitat. Groundwater levels explained 97% of the temporal variation in surface water levels measured at 47 monitoring points and exhibited annual cycles linked to evapotranspiration rates. Least Chub and Utah Chub migrated from springs to ponds, which were used as spawning and juvenile habitat, when groundwater and surface water levels were high during the early spring, but became concentrated in deep springs as ponds receded during the late summer and early fall. Populations of both species became increasingly fragmented as groundwater and surface water levels declined. Specific differences in the relative abundances and body sizes of juvenile Least Chub inhabiting different seasonally isolated regions of the spring complex persisted over multiple years, suggesting that juvenile growth rates and survival were influenced by connectivity of core spring habitats to seasonally deep ponds. The nature of the relationship between groundwater and surface water levels indicated that long-term declines in shallow groundwater levels of >= 40 cm would eliminate most of the spawning and juvenile habitat in the spring complex.

J	van Eerden, MR; van Rijn, S				van Eerden, Mennobart R.; van Rijn, Stef			Time shift in the exploitation of fish stocks by Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo at Lake IJsselmeer: how wintering birds began competing for fish with breeding conspecifics	ARDEA												Monthly aerial bird counts showed a strong increase in the number of wintering Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis since the late 1990s at Lake IJsselmeer but not at Lake Markermeer-IJmeer. Compared to the 1980-1990s, breeding numbers also increased in this part of the system. The resulting increased exploitation of fish stocks was thought to have been possible because of a long-term increase in the stock of Ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus, despite a clear overall decline of total estimated fish biomass in the lake during the same period. The most likely cause of these shifts was thought to be the intensive commercial fishing regime, removing the large predatory fish first, followed by a strong reduction of stocks of large Bream Abramis brama, in turn paving the way for increases in the stocks of Ruffe. Increased predation by Cormorants on the enhanced stocks of small fishes was possible because of ameliorated underwater visibility in Lake IJsselmeer. Starting in 2000, there was a strong shift in both temporal habitat use and associated fish consumption by Cormorants towards the winter period. The local breeding birds, exploiting the same age-and size-structured community of fishes in the spring, thus face an already-depleted food resource. Compared to the 1980-1990s, fish consumption by Cormorants in winter increased by a factor of ten, whereas that by breeders did so by a factor of 1.6. Our calculations showed that the actual harvest of available fish stock by wintering and breeding Cormorants together was c. 5% in 1985-2000 and c. 15% in 2001-2015. The disproportionate division of the overall consumption ('harvest') of the fish stock towards the wintering birds is a strong argument for direct competition with their conspecifics breeding locally. In conclusion, we calculate that because of the increased winter exploitation initiated by the activities of an intensive commercial fishery, the fish consumption in summer and early autumn by breeding Cormorants and their offspring was suppressed by a factor of six.																			0373-2266	2213-1175				DEC	2021	109	3					457	470		10.5253/arde.v109i2.a16	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/arde.v109i2.a16													WOS:000825150800016

D19102	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Littoral zones at the interface of the lake and the catchment are intensive sites for mineralization of organic matter, but the contribution of vegetated littoral zone to winter fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from lake ecosystems into the atmosphere is poorly known. We studied littoral carbon gas fluxes and their spatial controls at five boreal lakes of varying trophic state during three consequent winters with contrasting snow conditions and flooding regimes. Lake-wide estimates including littoral winter release and potential pelagic spring pulse of gases were calculated for three lakes. Large interannual and spatial differences in carbon gas fluxes were controlled by the interaction of climatic factors, ice and snow cover, on-site hydrology, and apparently substrate supply from biomass production of the previous growing season. Littoral CO2 fluxes ranged from 0.9 to 7.5 mol m(-2) winter(-1), and the CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.04 to 0.38 mol m(-2) winter(-1), the latter being highest in eutrophic lakes. The vegetated littoral contributed the most (66-78%) to winter CH4 emissions from two lakes; in the smallest and most productive lake, pelagic accumulation exceeded littoral release. The large variation in littoral CO2 release could contribute to between-winter differences of 82% in lake-wide carbon gas emissions. The water level of the preceding summer and precipitation during early winter were found to be useful predictors for littoral carbon gas fluxes in winter. This suggests that the carbon gas exchange of a shallow boreal lake can be highly sensitive to changes in snowfall and subsequent flooding.

J	Bhagat, Y; Ruetz, CR				Bhagat, Yakuta; Ruetz, Carl R., III			Temporal and Fine-Scale Spatial Variation in Fish Assemblage Structure in a Drowned River Mouth System of Lake Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined patterns of fish community composition and the relation to environmental variation in a drowned river mouth system of Lake Michigan. Direct hydrological connections to the Muskegon River and Lake Michigan contribute to a unique ecosystem with large-lake and riverine influences, thus making Muskegon Lake of particular interest for assessing fish community structure across spatiotemporal scales. Using overnight fyke-net sets, we sampled the fish community at four littoral sites in Muskegon Lake during spring, summer, and fall of 2003-2009; we also measured a suite of physicochemical variables at each sampling location and event. Among the most abundant species captured were the yellow perch Perca flavescens, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, and bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus. Results from nonmetric multidimensional scaling showed that fish assemblages varied strongly across seasons and across sites but that annual variation was weak. Canonical correspondence analysis by season showed that temperature was the most important variable in spring, whereas turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and depth were more influential in structuring fish communities during summer. Macrophyte cover played a significant role in explaining community composition in the fall. We observed patterns of seasonal temporal variation in species-environment relationships, similar to patterns observed in purely lacustrine systems. We also observed patterns of fine-scale spatial variation, which are typically noted in purely riverine systems. As such, our results have implications for predicting and determining patterns in other drowned river mouth lakes and reservoirs that are heavily influenced by both riverine and large-lake dynamics.

Forty-four fish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and monitored over 12 mo (November 2005 to October 2006). Fish moved throughout the Gippsland Lakes at average rates of 8.7 km d(-1) over 12 mo, with some fish moving distances of up to 2600 km. Fish frequently moved among the major estuarine rivers (Tambo, Mitchell and Nicholson rivers), sometimes moving up to 30 km in a day. Fish use of the rivers, river entrances and lakes varied strongly with the time of year. Fish spent more time in the lakes than rivers in late summer and early autumn, but began to use the rivers more than the lakes at the end of autumn. River use was greatest in early to mid-winter, then gradually decreased through spring. Fish also spent more time in some rivers than others, with use of their respective entrances peaking during transition phases when fish were moving from the rivers to the lakes and vice versa. Time of day was a weak predictor of regional patterns of fish use, but during the transitional phases (March through May) fish use of lakes was greater at night, while use of rivers was greater during the day. Monthly variation in time spent by fish in particular rivers varied positively with the discharge of freshwater (with a concomitant negative relationship between lake use and overall river discharge).					; Jenkins, Gregory/AAE-9856-2020	Jenkins, Gregory/0000-0001-5793-6844; 													0171-8630	1616-1599					2008	366						219	229		10.3354/meps07519	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps07519													WOS:000259768800020
J	Egbert, ME; Rulifson, RA				Egbert, Mary E.; Rulifson, Roger A.			Age and growth, reproductive biology, and histology in Atlantic needlefish (Strongylura marina) in a coastal freshwater lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The Atlantic needlefish (Strongylura marina) is a coastal epipelagic species inhabiting shallow coastal waters along the western Atlantic coast from Maine to Brazil. Little has been published about the species due to lack of commercial or sport value. A population exists in Lake Mattamuskeet, a coastal lake connected to Pamlico Sound (NC, USA) via four man-made canals, and fish access is controlled by water-control structures. Herein we describe the life history and age and growth dynamics of the species in the lake. Based on anecdotal and state reports, we believe this species may exhibit anadromy. Sampling was from March to May 1997 and 1998, and from March to October 2001. We also collected from another coastal watershed to complete the length distribution. Spring adults had a high gonadosomatic index compared with autumn (fall) adults, which had atresia. No eggs or age-0 fish were captured in the lake during summer. The four length cohorts matched growth and back-calculated length at age. Otoliths were linearly related to fish length and were used for ageing and growth calculations. Although we found no direct evidence of spawning, data compilation suggests that Atlantic needlefish could be using this lake for reproduction.

J	HORN, H; HORN, H; PAUL, L				HORN, H; HORN, H; PAUL, L			LONG-TERM TRENDS IN THE NUTRIENT INPUT AND IN-LAKE CONCENTRATIONS OF A DRINKING-WATER RESERVOIR IN A DENSE POPULATED CATCHMENT-AREA (ERZGEBIRGE, GERMANY)	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The concentrations of soluble reactive and total phosphate, silicate, and nitrate in the tributaries and in the watercolumn of the meso/eutrophic reservoir Saidenbach were investigated at weekly or fortnightly intervals. The results are presented as annual averages over 16 years (from 1975 till 1990) and show a gradual increase of the N- and P-concentration in the inlets caused by an intensification of the agriculture in the drainage basin and high domestic sewage releases from the settlements having no waste water treatment. The silicate concentration of the inlets remained constant. Consequently, also a rise of the in-lake concentrations of the two P-fractions was observed. The nitrate concentration of the reservoir Saidenbach increased till 1978, but showed no significant trend over the whole investigation period. The drop of the in-lake silicate concentration during the eighties has to be explained by diminished discharges and, most of all, a higher biological activity as a consequence of the increased P-loading. Intra-annual concentrations calculated as winter, spring, summer (epi- and hypolimnion) and autumn means show the distinct seasonal periodicity of the phosphorus and silicon cycles. Therefore, annual average in-lake concentrations of these nutrients are not quite good measures reflecting changes of the trophic conditions, but rather the winter and early spring values are. No correlations were detected between the annual mean concentrations and the loads. On the other hand, no remarkable seasonal cycling of the nitrate concentrations could be observed and, in this case, a clear dependence exists between annual mean concentrations and loads. The results found for the tributaries of the meso/eutrophic reservoir Saidenbach were compared with those observed in the inlets of the neighbouring oligotrophic reservoir Neunzehnhain. Here the phosphorus concentrations remained almost constant during the time of investigation, but the nitrate concentrations increased too. This must be attributed to agriculture, air pollution and forest management.																			0020-9309						1994	79	2					213	227																WOS:A1994NW40300004
J	Rosen, MR; Coshell, L; Turner, JV; Woodbury, RJ				Rosen, MR; Coshell, L; Turner, JV; Woodbury, RJ			Hydrochemistry and nutrient cycling in Yalgorup National Park, western Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lakes Clifton, Hayward, and Preston, Western Australia, are part of an east-west chain of 11 ground-water-fed lakes that make up the Clifton-Preston Lakeland system. Their hydrochemistries exhibit a large range in salinities (14-207 kg m(-3) total dissolved solids (TDS)) both seasonally within each lake and among lakes. The chemistry of all the lake waters in the system is an Na-Cl-SO4 brine, similar to seawater composition. However, all three lakes have less SO4, Br, Sr, Mn, and probably Fe than seawater; the concentrations of Ca and HCO3 vary seasonally. The variation of Ca and HCO3 in all three lakes suggests that calcium carbonate is precipitated during the late summer and early autumn when evaporation is most intense. In the upper and lower water layers of Lake Hayward the concentrations of conservative ions such as Na, Cl, and K decrease in winter and increase in summer, indicating dilution by winter rain and concentration via evaporation in the summer. Concentrations of total Fe and Mn in the lower layer increase in winter, suggesting release from the sediments and/or decay of the benthic microbial mat on the lake floor. TIN (total inorganic nitrogen)/PO4-P ratios and TN (total nitrogen)/PO4-P ratios are high in all lakes, suggesting that P is the limiting nutrient in the system. Observed increases of the macroalgae Cladophora in Lake Clifton suggest that any potential increase in the PO4 load to the lake will be taken up by the invigorated growth of these algae and may not be detected by measuring lake water PO4 concentrations. The increased growth of Cladophora is detrimental to the health of the well-established microbialite community on the eastern shore of Lake Clifton.

J	Liu, DY; Morrison, RJ; West, RJ				Liu, Dongyan; Morrison, R. John; West, Ronald J.			Phytoplankton assemblages of two intermittently open and closed coastal lakes in SE Australia	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Species composition and biomass of phytoplankton assemblages of a heavily impacted lake (Lake Illawarra) and a less impacted lake (Burrill Lake) in the South-Eastern region of Australia were compared based on bimonthly samples from three sites in each lake collected between April 2005 and April 2007. Lake Illawarra was generally characterized by higher nutrient concentrations and lower salinity than Burrill Lake. Phytoplankton assemblages displayed significant differences between the two lakes in terms of the dominant species composition and patterns of seasonal change rather than biomass. Diatoms were the dominant species in Lake Illawarra on most sampling occasions. In contrast, dinoflagellates (including toxic species) dominated in Burrill Lake during most seasons. Seasonal succession of phytoplankton in the two lakes did not follow the strict spring maximum that is generally observed in temperate waters. In Burrill Lake, maximum phytoplankton biomass often occurred in winter, while the maximum biomasses in Lake Illawarra occurred in autumn, winter and spring. The significant difference of nutrient structure between two lakes and warm temperate regime was regarded as important factors to affect these results. The results suggested care should be taken when relying on estuary health "indicators", such as chlorophyll a, rather than more detailed investigations of phytoplankton species compositions.

This lake, according to its glacial origin, is type 28b, using HUTCHINSON'S classification (1957). The bathymetric map shows a maximum depth of 274 m and an average of 163 m, differing from that published by DONOSO & PHINNEY (1988). According to its physical and chemical characteristics, this lake is oligotrophic, monomictic temperate, with winter circulation at 10-degrees-C and summer stratification, with high transparency (20 m maximum depth, Secchi disk). The theoretical renewal time of the water volume was calculated to be 12 years. The lake is poor in nutrients, with a high N:P ratio, and phosphorus as limiting factor for the phytoplankton. The cycle of these nutrients is related with maximum winter primary productivity and high efficiency of small chlorophyll a levels. The phytoplankton exhibited a summer maximum with predominance of Cyanophyceae (Microcystis) and Chrysophyceae (Paulscbulzia) and a spring maximum at the end of the circulation with predominance of diatoms (Melosira). The zooplankton was dominated by calanoid copepodes with the species Boeckella gracilipes, followed by the cladocera Eubosmina bagmanni and the copepod Mesocyclops longisetus. In the rotifera Callotheca pelagica was dominant. The zooplankton exhibited a maximum of abundance in spring.

Three stations were selected along a horizontal transect in Warm Creek Bay to determine the physical, chemical and biological differences based on depth and proximity to terrestrial influence. The bay is a warm monomictic system that initiates overturn in mid-Oct. to early Nov., depending upon the depth of the sampling station. Restratification starts about the end of April. Summer thermal stratification leads to a zone of O2 depletion below 15 m at the 2 deepest stations. The shallowest station (5 m) did not stratify in this manner resulting in different physico-chemical and biological conditions. The 20 dominant algal species consistently made up 85% or more of the total number of cells at any given sampling date and maximal algal populations were typically subsurface. The pattern of seasonal algal succession was typical of that found in many moderate-sized temperate lakes, a spring diatom pulse (Fragilaria crotonensis and Asterionella formosa), a diverse phytoplankton summer community (Dinobryon sertularia and chloroccocalean), a late autumn diatom (Synedra delicatissima var. angustissima) increase and a pronounced winter phytoplankton paucity. Correlation coefficients were calculated between total algal density, certain dominant species and various environmental parameters which implicated water temperature as an extremely important regulator of phytoplankton density in Warm Creek Bay. Concentrations of N compounds often correlated significantly with both total number of phytoplankton cells and individual species. Evidence is presented to support the belief that diatoms may be less valid indicator organisms than other phytoplankton groups. Avoidance of competition by spatiotemporal segregation of populations of Scenedesmus dimorphus, S. bijuga and S. quadricauda is discussed.					stewart, arthur/D-8471-2012														0003-9136						1976	78	2					139	164																WOS:A1976CF26100001

The sources of nitrogen and its uptake by growing phytoplankton were therefore studied. Experiments were carried out on samples collected from the middle of the Eastern (Siofok) and Western (Keszthely) basins between February and October 2001. Ammonium, urea and nitrate uptake and ammonium regeneration were measured in the upper 5-cm layer of sediment using the N-15-technique. Ammonium was determined by an improved microdiffusion assay. N-2 fixation rates were measured by the acetylene-reduction method. Ammonium regeneration rates in the sediment were similar in the two basins. They were relatively low in winter (0.13 and 0.16 mu g N cm(-3) day(-1) in the Eastern and Western basin, respectively), increased slowly in the spring (0.38 and 0.45 mu g N cm(-3) day(-1)) and peaked in late summer (0.82 and 1.29 mu g N cm(-3) day(-1), respectively). Ammonium uptake was predominant in spring in the Eastern basin and in summer in the Western basin, coincident with the cyanobacterial bloom. The amount of N-2 fixed was less than one third of the internal load during summer when external N loading was insignificant. Potentially, the phytoplankton N demand could be supported entirely by the internal N load via ammonium regeneration in the water column and sediment. However, the quantity of N from ammonium regeneration in the upper layer of sediment combined with that from the water column would limit the standing phytoplankton crop in spring in both basins and in late summer in the Western basin, especially when the algal biomass increases suddenly.

During the day, mysids in shallow Muriel Lake (less-than-or-equal-to 45 m) were on or near the bottom; in Kennedy Lake (> 100 m), mysids remained deeper than 50 m. In both lakes, mysids spent summer nights at 0-15 m depths despite > 20-degrees-C temperatures. Mysid density was not strongly correlated with lake depth. Mysids generally displayed spring to early summer minima and late summer to fall maxima in numbers and biomass. Single peaks in gravid females and juvenile mysid abundance, and the absence of pronounced seasonal size changes of gravid females suggest that N. mercedis produced a single generation each year. Fecundities of study lake mysids are the lowest on record, and although size-dependent, exhibited unusually high variability. Annual productivity of mysids averaged 485 mg m-2 y-1 (range 205-690). Calculations indicate mysids consume several times more zooplankton per annum than limnetic fish do. N. mercedis is likely an important competitor of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) since: (i) sockeye exhibit food limited growth and survival patterns in coastal lakes, (ii) mysids and sockeye consume similar zooplankton plankton prey and (iii) mysids do not contribute greatly to sockeye diet (i.e. < 26% of summer and fall diets by numbers or weight).																			0018-8158					FEB 28	1992	230	1					9	30		10.1007/BF00015111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015111													WOS:A1992HN79800002

Six sites in Sweden (Krycklan), Canada (Wolf Creek; Baker Creek; Dorset), Scotland (Girnock) and theUSA (Dry Creek) span moisture and energy gradients found at high latitudes. A meta-analysis was carried out using the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model to estimate the main storage changes characterizing annual water balances. Annual snowpack storage importance was ranked as Wolf Creek > Krycklan > Dorset > Baker Creek > Dry Creek > Girnock. The subsequent rate and longevity of melt were reflected in calibrated parameters that determine partitioning of waters between more rapid and slower flowpaths and associated variations in soil and groundwater storage. Variability of stream water isotopic composition depends on the following: (i) rate and duration of spring snowmelt; (ii) significance of summer/autumn rainfall; and (iii) relative importance of near-surface and deeper flowpaths in routing water to the stream. Flowpath partitioning also regulates influences of summer evaporation on drainage waters. Deviations of isotope data from the Global Meteoric Water Line showed subtle effects of internal catchment processes on isotopic fractionation most likely through evaporation. Such effects are highly variable among sites and with seasonal differences at some sites. After accounting for climate, evaporative fractionation is strongest at sites where lakes and near-surface runoff processes in wet riparian soils can mobilize isotopically enriched water during summer and autumn. Given close soil-vegetation coupling, this may result in spatial variability in soil water isotope pools available for plant uptake. We argue that stable isotope studies are crucial in addressing the many open questions on hydrological functioning of northern environments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The annual cycles of phytoplankton biomass	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Terrestrial plants are powerful climate sentinels because their annual cycles of growth, reproduction and senescence are finely tuned to the annual climate cycle having a period of one year. Consistency in the seasonal phasing of terrestrial plant activity provides a relatively low-noise background from which phenological shifts can be detected and attributed to climate change. Here, we ask whether phytoplankton biomass also fluctuates over a consistent annual cycle in lake, estuarine-coastal and ocean ecosystems and whether there is a characteristic phenology of phytoplankton as a consistent phase and amplitude of variability. We compiled 125 time series of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a concentration) from temperate and subtropical zones and used wavelet analysis to extract their dominant periods of variability and the recurrence strength at those periods. Fewer than half (48%) of the series had a dominant 12-month period of variability, commonly expressed as the canonical spring-bloom pattern. About 20 per cent had a dominant six-month period of variability, commonly expressed as the spring and autumn or winter and summer blooms of temperate lakes and oceans. These annual patterns varied in recurrence strength across sites, and did not persist over the full series duration at some sites. About a third of the series had no component of variability at either the six-or 12-month period, reflecting a series of irregular pulses of biomass. These findings show that there is high variability of annual phytoplankton cycles across ecosystems, and that climate-driven annual cycles can be obscured by other drivers of population variability, including human disturbance, aperiodic weather events and strong trophic coupling between phytoplankton and their consumers. Regulation of phytoplankton biomass by multiple processes operating at multiple time scales adds complexity to the challenge of detecting climate-driven trends in aquatic ecosystems where the noise to signal ratio is high.

Spatial ecology of translocated American Eel (Anguilla rostrata) in a large freshwater lake	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												American Eel (Anguilla rostrata) undertake extensive migrations from their rearing grounds to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, and historically the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario provided an important source for large, fecund female eel. Following declines in the Lake Ontario population, glass eel were translocated from eastern Canada from 2006 to 2010. From 2016 to 2018, large, presumably translocated yellow eel (N = 230) with the potential to begin maturing and out-migrating within their year of capture were collected in spring and fall and tagged with acoustic transmitters. Eel were released into eastern Lake Ontario and tracked to better understand their movement patterns prior to and during migration, and the timing of migration. Most eels successfully migrated out of Lake Ontario (64%). Timing of migration was consistent regardless of year or tagging season and primarily occurred in late summer or fall, with cooling water temperatures and decreasing sky illumination associated with initiation for fall tagged eel. Eels were mostly detected in eastern Lake Ontario and those in western Lake Ontario were mostly detected in shallow waters (< 20 m) close to shore. Eels were detected on fewer receivers in the winter, suggesting reduced movements during this season. Finally, larger individuals spent less time in the system, particularly when tagged in the fall. These findings confirm that translocated eels can migrate out of Lake Ontario; however, the weeks when migration occurred were more aligned with timing in their natal range (i.e., eastern Canada) than with naturally recruited eels from Lake Ontario. This temporal mismatch requires further consideration, since it may influence arrival times of translocated eel to the spawning grounds and their recruitment potential. These results can be used to inform future assessments of eel translocation efficacy and can also aid in the design of future tracking studies to more completely explore the downstream migration success of eel translocated into the highly productive waters of Lake Ontario.					; Pratt, Thomas/LTC-9063-2024	Pratt, Thomas/0009-0003-3648-2144; Stahl, Alienor/0000-0002-2297-7379														2050-3385				JAN 12	2023	11	1							2	10.1186/s40317-022-00308-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-022-00308-9													WOS:000913328400001

River Slupia is 138.6 km long and flowing into the Baltic Sea. The average water discharge of the river is 15.5 m(3) s(-1) and its slope is about 1.3% which gives it a mountainous character. The numbers of culturable heterotrophic bacteria was determined on iron-peptone agar (IPA) medium and the numbers of culturable proteolytic bacteria was assayed in IPA medium enriched with gelatin. Potential leucine aminopeptidase activity was carried out with the use of fluorescently labelled model substrate MCA-leucine. The numbers of heterotrophic bacteria ranged between 0.33 to 183.0 x 10(3) cells cm(-3) (maximum in spring, minimum in winter); the abundance of culturable proteolytic bacteria ranged 0.50 to 31.8 x 10(3) cells cm(-3) and the maximum was noted in spring, the lowest in summer. The activity of extracellular leucine aminopeptidase ranged from 2.34 to 6.87 mu M MCA dm(-3) h(-1) and the highest value was noted in spring while the lowest were noted in winter and summer. The values of bacteriological parameters and of leucine aminopepidase activity tended to be higher below the sewage treatment plant. The bacteriological parameters for River Slupia were compared with the relevant data for other river ecosystems.																			1505-2249						2009	57	3					561	565																WOS:000270012200014

Advanced diagnosis of vibriosis among some marine fishes in lake Temsah, Egypt	JOURNAL OF THE HELLENIC VETERINARY MEDICAL SOCIETY												Vibriosis is a serious disease affecting marine water fishes. The present study was applied on 320 marine fishes of four equal different species (Sparus auratus, Mugil cephalus, Mugil seheli and Tilapia zillii) each 80. Fishes were collected seasonally and randomly from Lake Temsah in Ismailia governorate from September 2015 to August 2016. The signs and lesions of severe septicemia, hemorrhages and ulcerations were observed among the examined fishes. Isolated bacteria were observed as yellow and green pigmented colonies on TCBS media, and as creamy colored colonies on TSA media with 2.5% NaCl concentration. The causative agent was identified as vibrio sp. Concerning gene expression, most isolates were molecularly identified using the pvsA gene primers giving a product size of 338-bp size and 348-bp for V. alginolyticus and V. parahemolyticus respectively. The highest prevalence of vibriosis was recorded in T. zillii (63.75%), M. seheli (37.5%) then M. cephalus and Sparus auratus (28.75%) while the total prevalence was (39.69%). The highest seasonal prevalence was recorded in summer (81.25%) followed by spring (35%) then autumn (23.75%) and winter (18.75%). The highest prevalence of organ specifity was in liver, kidneys then spleen and gills.

Twenty adult female Columbian black-tailed deer (O. hemionus columbianus) were radiocollared near these reservoirs and monitored and during Feb. 1981-June 1982 to determine present migration routes, chronology of movements, and selection of seasonal ranges and habitats. Five deer migrated to high elevations (2070-2160 m), 11 migrated to elevations of 900-1520 m, and 4 deer maintained year-round home ranges at elevations of 800-980 m. Reservoir construction apparently altered migration routes by direct displacement and probably forced some of the herd to travel routes traditionally used by other deer. Some radio-collared deer swam 1.0-1.5 km across Trinity Lake, traveled as far as 35 km and utilized up to 3 delay areas en route to summer ranges. Five does summered at elevations that were 30-150 m lower than their winter ranges. Radio-collared does selected riparian areas both day and night, especially as fawning cover, but generally used the more open clearcut and south slope areas only at night. Dense forest was selected more often during the day than at night in the summer. Does that inhabited the most diverse areas maintained smaller summer home ranges. Winter storms forced deer to temporarily leave their normal winter home ranges and inhabit limited lower elevation key winter ranges. Between winter stores deer moved back to higher elevation winter ranges, which were preferred over the key areas.

J	Tripe, JA; Guy, CS				Tripe, JA; Guy, CS			Spatial and temporal variation in habitat and fish community characteristics in a Kansas Flint Hills stream	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Four locations (i.e., mouth, lower midreach, upper midreach, and headwater) were sampled bimonthly for two years in a Kansas, Flint Hills stream. Principal components 1 (PC1; depth, width, substrate) and 2 (PC2; velocity, water temperature, conductivity) accounted for 70% of the variation in habitat variables. Principal component 1 varied more spatially than temporally, and PC2 exhibited the opposite pattern. Species diversity varied spatially with the highest values at the upper midreach and mouth and lowest in the headwaters. Species diversity also varied temporally with highest values in summer months and lowest in late fall and early spring. Catch per unit effort (C/f) varied temporally and spatially by trophic guilds and species. In general, C/f values were highest in late fall and early spring and were lowest in early and mid summer. Fixed spatial variation (i.e., spatial difference independent of temporal factors) was higher than ephemeral spatial variation (i.e., spatial variation that varies temporally) for species with specialized feeding habits. Conversely, ephemeral spatial variation was highest for fish species with generalized feeding habits. These data indicate that standardizing reaches and dates are important if habitat, species diversity, and C/f data will be used in managing stream ecosystems.																			0906-6691					DEC	1999	8	4					216	226		10.1111/j.1600-0633.1999.tb00073.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.1999.tb00073.x													WOS:000084076000003

The daily average concentration of BC was 145 +/- 85 ng m(-3), increasing by 50% since 2006. The seasonal variation of BC shows higher concentrations in spring and summer and lower concentrations in autumn and winter, dominated by the adjacent sources and meteorological conditions. The diurnal variation of BC showed that its concentrations peaked at 9:00-16:00 (UTC + 8), significantly related to local human activities (e.g., animal-manure burning and nearby traffic due to the tourism industry). The concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis showed that the long-distance transport of BC from South Asia could also be a potential contributor to BC at the NCL, as well as the biomass burning by the surrounding residents. The analyses of the absorption coefficient and absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent show the consistency of sourcing the BC at the NCL. We suggest here that urgent measures should be taken to protect the atmospheric environment at the NCL, considering the fast-increasing concentrations of BC as an indicator of fuel combustion.

It has become established in many regions of Europe, and has spread with increasing rapidity in recent decades. Its reproductive behaviour allows this species to proliferate rapidly. The selected grasslands are located in the Carpathian Basin in Hungary, in the area of Kiskuns & aacute;g National Park, near Lake Kolon. In the framework of the research, in two consecutive years (2021 and 2022), and in two different seasons (spring and autumn), we examined the percentage cover of vascular plant species in the stands degraded by A. syriaca and the natural control (without A. syriaca), and their seasonal and interannual dynamics. Between the A. syriaca-degraded and natural control stands, there was no significant difference in the number of species in the spring and autumn of any of the examined years. Surprisingly, in the spring, the degraded stands were somewhat richer in vascular plant species. In autumn, the control stands had more vascular plant species, but to a lesser extent. The Shannon diversity was higher in the A. syriaca-dominated stands than in the control in all recording periods. Simpson diversity showed a similar pattern to Shannon diversity, with one exception in spring 2022. In the case of the social behaviour type, it can be clearly seen that the alien competitor (AC) species dominated in spring and autumn in both years in the stand dominated by A. syriaca. In the natural control stand, specialists (S) and competitors (C) dominated in both years and in both seasons. The negative effect of the invasive species on the number and diversity of species was presumably significantly reduced by the significant drying of the study area experienced in recent years.

J	Dugan, HA				Dugan, Hilary A.			A Comparison of Ecological Memory of Lake Ice-Off in Eight North-Temperate Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ice-off dates on lakes are some of the longest phenological records in the field of ecology, and some of the best evidence of long-term climatic change. However, there has been little investigation as to whether the date of ice-off on a lake impacts spring and summer ecosystem dynamics. Here, I analyzed 274 years of long-term data from eight north temperate lakes in two climate zones to address whether lakes have ecological memory of ice-off in the subsequent summer. Five metrics were investigated: epilimnion temperatures, hypolimnion temperatures, hypolimnetic oxygen drawdown, water clarity, and spring primary productivity. The response of the metrics to ice-off date were variable across latitude and lake type. The northern set of lakes stratified quickly following ice-off, and early ice-off years resulted in significantly warmer hypolimnetic temperatures. Oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion was not impacted by ice-off date, likely because in late ice-off years the lakes did not fully mix. In the southern lakes, ice-off date was not correlated to the onset of stratification, with the latter being a more dominant control on hypolimnetic temperature and oxygen. The implications of these findings is that as ice-off date trends earlier in many parts of the world, the lakes that will likely experience the largest changes in spring and summer ecosystem properties are the lakes that currently have the longest duration of lake ice. In considering a future with warmer winters, these results provide a starting point for predicting how lake ecosystem properties will change with earlier ice-off.

A major shift in Daphnia genetic structure after the first ice-free winter in a German reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Climate warming may cause disruption of trophic linkages in aquatic ecosystems and lead to changes in abundance and genetic structure of zooplankton populations. We monitored the community of the Daphnia galeata-hyalina hybrid complex in the Saidenbach Reservoir (Saxony, Germany) using allozyme electrophoresis for three consecutive years (2005-07), including one (2007) following an unusually warm winter that prevented the formation of ice cover for the first time in the history of the reservoir. 2. Genetic composition during the 2007 season differed substantially from the two preceding years that experienced the usual 3-month ice period. Three abundance peaks in June, July and October 2007 were dominated by hybrids of Daphnia galeata x hyalina, whereas in the 2005 and 2006 seasons two peaks in June and September were dominated by Daphnia hyalina genotypes. 3. The genetic composition of the pool of diapausing eggs produced in autumn and the rate of change of genotype abundance during the following spring indicate recruitment of the D. hyalina subpopulation from ex-ephippial animals during the spring population increase. 4. The differing potential to contribute to the overwintering animal pool or to the inoculum from diapausing eggs was confirmed by results from laboratory life-table experiments. Daphnia galeata clones survived longer and produced parthenogenetic offspring under winter conditions, whereas D. hyalina clones showed a shorter lifespan and produced resting eggs. 5. Our results indicate a profound role of recruitment strategy in the observed shift in genetic composition. Increasing winter temperatures predicted in the context of climate change may thus favour overwintering animals, leading to an increase in the contribution of these genotypes to the population. Such microevolutionary processes may dampen possible seasonal mismatches between daphnid populations and their food or predator populations.

Since the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) began operations, the lake's hydrological regime has been changed, which may influence the growth of submerged plants and increase the risk of food shortages for wintering waterbirds. We explored the effect of hydrological regime change in Poyang Lake on food abundance for herbivorous waterbirds using a 19-year (1999-2017) monitoring dataset of densities of Vallisneria and their tubers. Overall, food abundance decreased significantly and fluctuated considerably after the TGD started full operations in 2009. The change was significantly correlated with the autumn drought and summer flood. Densities of plants and their tubers in early winter significantly increased with higher water levels in the previous October, and significantly decreased with higher June water levels. Autumn drought magnified the negative effect of average June water levels, and the combined effect explained 86.9% of the deviance in Vallisneria density. The optimal generalized additive model (GAM) for tuber abundance (explaining 86.2% of the deviance) contained the average June water levels, tuber density two years before and the average water level of the previous October. Average water levels in June and the previous October were important predictors of food abundance. However, TGD operations have made droughts in October a norm since 2006 and resulted in more frequent June floods. It is concluded that the risk of food shortages probably has become a new norm in Poyang Lake. The results offer new information for waterbird conservation and hydrological regime management for Poyang Lake, as well as for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River as a whole.

Seasonal distribution of omul (Coregonus autumnalis migratorius (Georgi)) in Lake Baikal: implications for acoustics assessment	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2005	Advances in Limnology				9th International Symposium on Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	JUL 21-AUG 27, 2005	Olsztyn, POLAND					We describe the seasonal distribution of omul (Coregonus autumnalis migratorius) in Lake Baikal using data from gill net, bottom trawl and acoustic surveys carried out between 1966 and 1998 with special attention to the best timing for future acoustic surveys. Omul distribution varies with season and among eco-morphotypes (coastal, pelagic, and deep-water). The winter distribution is characterized by concentrations of all three morphotypes in the slope zone in 100-350 m deep water, scattered fish in the lower layers of the epi-pelagic zone, and a complete absence of omul from the surface to 50 m depth in both the nearshore and offshore regions. In the summer and autumn, pelagic omul occupy the top 50 m of both offshore and nearshore regions including bays. At this time, the deep-water omul is found close to the bottom in depths of 125-175 m. During the early spring transition period, pelagic omul reside in 50-150 m depth and deep-water omul in 250-350 m depth. At this time, the omul morphotypes are separated spatially and pelagic omul do not overlap with other species present in the upper 50 m. This transition period (typically from end of May to the beginning of June) is therefore the best time for acoustic surveys of omul in Lake Baikal.

Phytoplankton are an important assessor of the health of aquatic ecosystems, particularly in lakes. As such, the characterisation of phytoplankton communities over time enables a detailed assessment of a water body's ecological condition. This study examined the characteristics of cyanobacteria in Lough Arrow, a lake in Ireland's northwest, over the course of a year to ascertain their community dynamics as well as potential for cyanotoxin production. DGGE analysis of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons for spherical cyanobacteria revealed seasonal shifts in Lough Arrow, with greater diversity in the summer and autumn. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that seasonal changes in the cyanobacterial community were largely driven by changes in environmental factors such as temperature and conductivity. The presence of the toxigenic species Microcystis sp. was confirmed from DGGE profiles. Analysis for the potential production of microcystin toxins in the lake was undertaken via qPCR analysis of the mcyE gene. No significant difference between the summer and autumn seasons was observed. Microcystin concentrations, estimated via the application of an ELISA assay, showed very low concentrations in the lake (max conc. 0.027 mu g/l), which were not significantly different between the summer and autumn. The species richness and abundance of cyanobacteria in Lough Arrow was seasonal; responding dynamically to changes in environmental factors. The presence of Microcystis sp. and potential for microcystin production detected in the summer and autumn seasons indicating that the establishment of a tailored monitoring plan could be of benefit for better ascertaining and managing water quality parameters and potential risks to human and animal health.

Dry body wt increases were best described by 2nd and 3rd order polynomial equations, with maximum values occurring in late autumn. Data on body caloric and lipid contents indicated a period of rapid storage in late summer and early autumn. Declines in average dry body weight, body calories and body lipids occurred during the winter months. The intensity of the fattening process was greater in age I fish than in ages 0 and II fish. The highest values of body lipids (30% of dry weight) and calories (6909 cal/g ash-free dry weight) were observed in age-I fish on 16 Nov. and 20 Nov. 1973, respectively. Lipid reserves were mobilized during overwintering and, in age II fish, during the reproductive cycle. Energy reserves may also be utilized for body maintenance and growth when reductions occur in the availability or quality of the food supply.

J	Schleuter, D; Eckmann, R				Schleuter, D.; Eckmann, R.			Generalist versus specialist: the performances of perch and ruffe in a lake of low productivity	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												To elucidate the performances of perch and ruffe in oligotrophic lakes, we carried out a field study in reoligotrophic Upper Lake Constance. Both these percids used the same habitat, albeit with different activity patterns. Interspecific competition for food was relevant only in summer when both species fed on zoobenthos. Even then, niche overlap was low, while intraspecific diet overlap was moderate to high throughout the season. Perch did not perform fixed, ontogenetic diet shifts, but used a wide range of prey. During spring and early summer, all size classes were planktivorous, then switched to benthivory and cannibalism in summer, and part of the population reverted to planktivory in autumn. Ruffe, by contrast, fed mainly on chironomid larvae and pupae throughout the year. It is suggested that in lakes of low productivity the euryphagous characteristics of perch, including cannibalism, provide a clear advantage over the benthivorous specialist ruffe in two ways: (i) it allows perch to switch to alternative prey types if one prey type becomes scarce; and (ii) reduces both intra- and interspecific competition for food.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				MAR	2008	17	1					86	99		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00262.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00262.x													WOS:000252711800011

Nearly five years of catchment acidification did not induce significant changes in TOC. TOC concentrations was not related clearly to precipitation or runoff. In both basins, there was a regular, seasonal pattern with a gradual increase in TOC concentrations from spring to late autumn. Minima in concentrations occurred during periods with frozen ground in winter, irrespective of discharge patterns. The decrease from similar to 10 mg C l(-1) in autumn to 1-2 mg Cl-1 in late winter, was only seen in surface layers. Runoff was the major loss route for surface TOC in the lake. Photo-oxidation, bacterial oxidation, and sedimentation combined yielded maximum loss rates of 3% of surface TOC d(-1). Below a depth of 1 m 0.5% d(-1) was lost to these same processes. The surface microlayer had 5-10 times more TOC than the bulk water on average, and could have effects , on gas exchange and sub-surface light. Despite the oxidation of TOC, the short residence time of the lake and rapid replacement of TOC from the catchment was the major determinant of lake water TOC.

However, it is often difficult to quantitatively compare or estimate the health of aquatic ecosystems for different watersheds. In this study, we developed a Freshwater Ecosystem Health Index (FEHI) based on a modified Zooplankton-based Index of Biotic Integrity (ZIBI) to address this difficulty. The ZIBI was developed based on the top six principal components (cumulative % = 88.6%) of 32 zooplankton community indicators. Then the ZIBI was transformed into the FEHI by using the arc-tangent function (to make FEHI fall into (0,1)). FEHI rating scales that were defined as (0,0.2), [0.2,0.4), [0.4,0.6), [0.6,0.8), [0.8,1) fall within bad, poor, fair, good, and excellent freshwater ecosystem health condition, respectively. Moreover, we established six estimation models of FEHI, respectively, directing at six situations that the available indicators are limited. The FEHI calculation and estimation models were then applied to evaluate three lakes and four river basins in eastern China. The results showed that the aquatic ecosystem health was good in areas that included rivers in Tongxiang plain, Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake, rural area of Qinhuai River basin, Shahu Lake during Summer/Autumn. However, the aquatic ecosystem health was bad or fair in Xuanwu Lake (an urban shallow lake), the urban area of Qinhuai River basin, Huaihe basin, Yinghe basin, and Shahu Lake in winter. The FEHI will be a new and effective approach for quantitative evaluation/estimation of freshwater aquatic ecosystem health in eastern China.					zeng, zhuo/KHX-1685-2024; Li-Ting, Sheng/KHE-3638-2024; Yang, MZ/JAD-1963-2023	cai, wang wei/0000-0001-7779-5380; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUL	2020	114								106333	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106333													WOS:000559756900002

Although these species have similar feeding habits and overlapping breeding distributions, their winter ranges differ markedly. Most blue-winged teal winter in the Neotropics, whereas most mallards remain in the temperate regions of North America. A seasonal comparison of OC exposure in these species may help determine the geographic origins of contamination. All examined OCs were found to be below concentrations known to affect reproduction in waterfowl. DDE was most often detected in blue-winged teal and PCBs, in mallards. DDE exposure may have predominantly occurred outside of Wisconsin. The DDE concentration in blue-winged teal samples collected in Wisconsin in the spring (GM = 0.406 mu g/g) were greater (P < 0.001) than in the fall (GM = 0.033 mu g/g) and greater than the concentrations in mallard samples from the spring (GM = 0.058 mu g/g; P(0.001). Cienaga Grande, however, was not a source of DDE contamination. The DDE concentrations in blue-winged teal samples from Cienaga Grande did not differ between the spring (GM = 0.037 mu g/g) and the fall (CM = 0.039 mu g/g) and were lower (P < 0.001) than the concentration in blue-winged teal samples from Wisconsin in the spring. In contrast, PCB contamination seemed to have occurred in Wisconsin and affected mostly mallards. PCBs were not detected in the samples from Colombia and were detected in only five (8.3%) of the blue-winged teal samples from Wisconsin (GM = 0.025 mu g/g), however, those compounds were detected in 47% of the mallard samples collected in Wisconsin (GM = 0.272 mu g/g). DDE and PCB concentrations were greater (P = 0.0) in mallard samples collected from wetlands adjacent to Lake Michigan than in samples from inland wetlands.																			0090-4341					AUG	1996	31	2					225	231											8781073					WOS:A1996VE11200011

Vertical and horizontal movement were studied in the freshwater bivalve Elliptio complanata at a sandy site in an oligotrophic lake over 3 years. Mussel movement did not vary significantly between day and night. On average, between 2 and 8% of 527 mussels moved each month during the ice-free season and the distance travelled by moving mussels averaged 0.6 cm day(-1). 2. Mussels were endobenthic during the winter, emerged from the sandy substrate in mid-May peaked in sediment surface abundance in July, and descended into the sediments for the winter in September-October. Vertical displacement of mussels was closely correlated with water temperature although daylength may play a role. Mussels apparently move very little beneath the sediment during the winter. 3. The number of mussels moving horizontally at any given time was linearly correlated with daylength, but the distance travelled during a sampling period was related to daylength in a non-linear fashion. Greatest horizontal displacement of epibenthic mussels was found during spring and early summer, coincident with spawning in E. complanata.

Collections at 2 stations were made at monthly intervals from Nov. 1948 to July 1950. Ext. and int. characters and obs. on behavior and movement of fish are descr. Fish is nocturnal, lying dormant under stones in daytime. Field obs. suggest that fish is tolerant of organic pollution. Age was detn. from otoliths and supported by length-frequency data. Fish which have attained 2 years grow faster in beck than in lake, a difference probably associated with eating more food. Mean length, in cm, attained at end of each yr. of life is as follows 4.7 (0), 8.0 (I), 9.9 (II), 10.8 (III), 11.4 (IV), 11.5 (V). For first 2 yrs. of life fish in Esthwaite Water and Black Beck grow similarly, but in third yr. of life, fish in Black Beck grow significantly faster than fish in ''Esthwaite Water. Male and female grow at a similar rate throughout life. Food, which consists chiefly of chironomid larvae, varies with size of fish, season of yr., and place of capture. Amt. of food eaten seasonally showed a winter minimum at both stations, but whereas in Black Beck there was a summer maximum, in Esthwaite Water there were maxima in spring and autumn. Spawning takes place in May in Lake District. Some fish attain 5.0 cm by winter of their first yr. of life and spawn when 1 yr. old; others less than 5.0 cm do not spawn until next season.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1955	24	1					167	186		10.2307/1884	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1884													WOS:A1955WV74300008

This study is designed to investigate the thermal neutral temperature of the outdoor space of Hangzhou West Lake. Both the median method and the thermal sensation vote (TSV) = 0 methods are adopted to discuss the seasonal thermal neutral temperature, thermal neutral temperature range, and thermal acceptable temperature range of the youth group with college students in Hangzhou as representatives. Via the analysis of the relationship between TSV and thermal evaluation index PET, the median method, which proved more suitable for the study site, is selected to obtain the thermal evaluation results. It's found from the study that, throughout the year, the thermal neutral temperature of Hangzhou West Lake scenic area is 21.0 degrees C; the thermal neutral temperature range is 12.0-23.9 degrees C, and the acceptable thermal temperature is 13.0-25.7 degrees C. The youth group visiting Hangzhou West Lake has the highest acceptance of the thermal environment in spring and autumn and the lowest in winter. Furthermore, the empirical models show that air temperature and average wind speed are the key factors impacting the thermal evaluation of the youth group. This study can serve as a reference for thermal evaluation in similar climate regions.

Distribution and movements of the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd 1990-2005: Prior to oil and gas development	ARCTIC												Four caribou (Rangifer tarandus grantii) herds calve on the North Slope of Alaska, three of which have been exposed to little or no resource development. We present 15 years of baseline data on the distribution and movements of 72 satellite-collared and 10 GPS-collared caribou from the Teshekpuk caribou herd (TCH) that have had little to no exposure to oil and gas activities. Fixed-kernel home range analyses of collared caribou revealed that calving grounds were concentrated (i.e., 50% kernel utilization distribution) along the northeastern, eastern, and southeastern shores of Teshekpuk Lake. During the post-calving period, 51% and 35% of caribou moved through two constricted zones to the east and west of Teshekpuk Lake, respectively, and accessed insect-relief habitat along the Beaufort Sea coast. During late summer and early fall, TCH caribou were concentrated to the southeast and southwest of Teshekpuk Lake. Although 65% of the Teshekpuk caribou wintered in two areas on the central coastal plain around the village of Atqasuk and south of Teshekpuk Lake, other TCH animals wintered in a great variety of places, including the Seward Peninsula, the eastern and southern Brooks Range, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We detected an apparent emigration rate of 6.9%. One male and five female TCH caribou joined the breeding populations of the Western Arctic and Central Arctic herds. TCH caribou traveled an average distance of 2348 190 km annually. Movement rates were at a maximum in midsummer, lowest in winter, and intermediate during spring and fall migrations. Restrictions on oil and gas leasing and surface occupancy have been in place to protect calving, migratory corridors, and insect-relief habitat for the TCH, but these protections are likely to be removed. These data will provide a good baseline that can be used to compare predevelopment distribution and movement patterns of TCH caribou to distribution and movement patterns during and after petroleum development.

J	SMITH, D; SMITH, RR				SMITH, D; SMITH, RR			RESPONSES OF RED-CLOVER TO INCREASING RATES OF TOPDRESSED POTASSIUM FERTILIZER	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												''Lakeland'' red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) was established on low K Typic Argiudoll (Plano silt loam) soil and topdressed during spring of the 2nd yr with 0-896 kg/ha of K as KCl. The three highest K rates also were applied in split applications with half topdressed in fall and half in spring. There was no advantage to splitting K rates between fall and spring. No significant differences in herbage yield were observed in response to the application rates of K. However, yields tended to decrease with the 672 and 896 kg K/ha spring applications. Analysis of the 2nd yr total herbage showed that concentrations of K and Cl increased with K topdressing rate, but concentrations of total nonstructural carbohydrates, N, P, Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, Zn, B, Sr, and Mn decreased. There was no effect of K fertilizer on concentrations of S, Fe, Al and percentage of IVDDM [in vitro digestible dry matter]. Residual herbage yields and stands in the 3rd yr, following a severe winter, increased steadily up to 336 (stand) or 448 kg/ha (herbage yield) of spring applied K. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. ''Vernal'') with similar spring K applications on adjacent plots yielded less than red clover at all K rates. Red clover yields were not increased as much as those of alfalfa by the topdressed K. Possibly red clover needs less K for maximum growth than alfalfa, or that at low soil K levels, red clover is better able to absorb K from the soil because of its profuse surface rooting.																			0002-1962	1435-0645					1977	69	1					45	48		10.2134/agronj1977.00021962006900010012x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1977.00021962006900010012x													WOS:A1977CY45300012

Hydrosoil residues and submersed aquatic plant biomass were monitored within the lake. Fluridone did not affect the submersed vegetation during the 4-month fall-winter treatment period. As water temperatures increased during spring, Hydrilla biomass declined at an average of 0.178 kg m-1 per month. By summer (192 days after last treatment), the target species could not be found within the lake. Fluoridone residues were detected in the hydrosoil immediately following treatments and generally peaked coinciding with the decline in aquatic plant biomass. The maximum fluoride detected in the hydrosoil was only 5% of the 2.25 kg ha-1 applied, and this amount was obtained from outside of a treatment area. Residue concentrations were highly variable between sampling sites and sampling periods and unexpectedly increased 14 months after treatment. Winter-killed marginal vegetation is a possible source of this increase. Detectable concentrations of fluoridone, and vegetation control, persisted for a total of 86 weeks from the date of the last treatment and non-detectable residues may have persisted after 86 weeks. This study indicates that a lower application rate might have provided adequate control of Hydrilla and possibly decreased residue concentrations in non-targeted areas.																			0031-613X						1987	21	1					73	82		10.1002/ps.2780210108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2780210108													WOS:A1987K612500007
J	Pilla, RM; Williamson, CE				Pilla, Rachel M.; Williamson, Craig E.			Earlier ice breakup induces changepoint responses in duration and variability of spring mixing and summer stratification in dimictic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Reductions in ice cover duration and earlier ice breakup are two of the most prevalent responses to climate warming in lakes in recent decades. In dimictic lakes, the subsequent periods of spring mixing and summer stratification are both likely to change in response to these phenological changes in ice cover. Here, we used a modeling approach to simulate the effect of changes in latitude on long-term trends in duration of ice cover, spring mixing, and summer stratification by "moving" a well-studied lake across a range of latitudes in North America (35.2 degrees N to 65.7 degrees N). We found a changepoint relationship between the timing of ice breakup vs. spring mixing duration on 09 May. When ice breakup occurred before 09 May, which routinely occurred at latitudes < 47 degrees N, spring mixing was longer and more variable; when ice breakup occurred after 09 May at latitudes > 47 degrees N, spring mixing averaged 1 day with low variability. In contrast, the duration of summer stratification showed a relatively slower rate of increase when ice breakup occurred before 09 May (< 47 degrees N) compared to a 109% faster rate of increase when ice breakup was after 09 May (> 47 degrees N). Projected earlier ice breakup can result in important nonlinear changes in the relative duration of spring mixing and summer stratification, which can lead to mixing regime shifts that influence the severity of oxygen depletion differentially across latitudes.

Comparatively little is known regarding the effects of such seasonal variation on the diet and resource use of fish species inhabiting these systems. Variation in the diet of European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) during periods of ice cover in this region is often regarded as common knowledge'; however, this aspect of the species' ecology has not been examined empirically. Here, we outline the differences in invertebrate community structure, fish activity, and resource use of monomorphic whitefish populations between summer (AugustSeptember) and winter (FebruaryMarch) in three subarctic lakes in Finnish Lapland. Benthic macroinvertebrate densities did not exhibit measurable differences between summer and winter. Zooplankton diversity and abundance, and activity levels of all fish species (measured as catch per unit effort) were lower in winter. The summer diet of C.lavaretus was typical of a generalist utilising a variety of prey sources. In winter, its dietary niche was significantly reduced, and the diet was dominated by chironomid larvae in all study sites. Pelagic productivity decreases during winter, and fish species inhabiting these systems are therefore restricted to feeding on benthic prey. Sampling time has strong effect on our understanding of resource utilisation by whitefish in subarctic lakes and should be taken into account in future studies of these systems.

J	Perga, ME; Gerdeaux, D				Perga, ME; Gerdeaux, D			'Are fish what they eat' all year round?	OECOLOGIA												Isotope turnover in muscle of ectotherms depends primarily on growth rather than on metabolic replacement. Ectotherms, such as fish, have a discontinuous pattern of growth over the year, so the isotopic Signature of muscle (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) may only reflect food consumed during periods of growth. In contrast, the liver is a regulatory tissue, with a continuous protein turnover. Therefore, the isotopic composition of liver should respond year round to changes in the isotopic signature of food sources. Therefore, we predicted that (1) Whitefish in Lake Geneva would have larger seasonal variation in the isotopic variation of the liver compared to that of the muscle tissue, and (2) the isotope composition of fish muscle would reflect a long-term image of the isotope composition of the food consumed only throughout the growth period. To test these expectations, we compared the isotope compositions of Whitefish muscle, liver and food in a 20-month study. We found that the seasonal amplitude of isotope variation was two to three times higher in liver compared to muscle tissue. During the autumn and winter, when growth was limited, only the isotopic signature of liver responded to changes in the isotope composition of the food sources. The delta(13)C and delta(15)N of muscle tissue only reflected the food consumed during the spring and summer growth period.

SUMMER AND WINTER OF PROKARYOTIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN XIANGXI RIVER AND SHENNONG CREEK IN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Few studies have reported about the summer and winter seasonal changes of prokaryotic community structure and their relationship with environmental factors in Xiangxi River and Shennong Creek in China. In this study, the 16S ribosome RNA (rRNA) gene cloning library was used to test the diversity of the aquatic prokaryotes along the Three Gorges Reservoir of the Yangtze River in China over two seasons in 2013. We analyzed the effects of summer and winter seasonal variation of the prokaryotic community composition and environmental factors. Diversity index analysis revealed that Shannon index, Chao1 index, Observed species index, and PD whole tree index of Xiangxi River were the highest in winter, and the four indices of Shennong Creek were the lowest in summer. Spatial analysis reported that the species diversity of Xiangxi River was significantly higher than that of Shennong Creek. Temporal analysis reported that the species diversity of Shennong Creek and Xiangxi River were higher in winter than in summer. The community classification analysis indicated that: at the phylum level, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria, and their relative abundance accounted for 65.05% of the total community. At the class level, Acidimicrobua had the highest relative abundance, accounting for 13.72% of all sequences, followed by Betaproteobacteria (13.12%) and Alphaproteobacteria (11.28%). The change of temperature was the main factor causing the summer and winter seasonal differences of prokaryotic biodiversity and community structure.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2022	20	2					1285	1300		10.15666/aeer/2002_12851300	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2002_12851300		DEC 2021											WOS:000779423100001

Temperature is a major driver of ecological processes in stream ecosystems, yet the dynamics of thermal regimes remain poorly described. Most work has focused on relatively simple descriptors that fail to capture the full range of conditions that characterise thermal regimes of streams across seasons or throughout the year. 2. To more completely describe thermal regimes, we developed several descriptors of magnitude, variability, frequency, duration and timing of thermal events throughout a year. We evaluated how these descriptors change over time using long-term (19792009), continuous temperature data from five relatively undisturbed cold-water streams in western Oregon, U.S.A. In addition to trends for each descriptor, we evaluated similarities among them, as well as patterns of spatial coherence, and temporal synchrony. 3. Using different groups of descriptors, we were able to more fully capture distinct aspects of the full range of variability in thermal regimes across space and time. A subset of descriptors showed both higher coherence and synchrony and, thus, an appropriate level of responsiveness to examine evidence of regional climatic influences on thermal regimes. Most notably, daily minimum values during winterspring were the most responsive descriptors to potential climatic influences. 4. Overall, thermal regimes in streams we studied showed high frequency and low variability of cold temperatures during the cold-water period in winter and spring, and high frequency and high variability of warm temperatures during the warm-water period in summer and autumn. The cold and warm periods differed in the distribution of events with a higher frequency and longer duration of warm events in summer than cold events in winter. The cold period exhibited lower variability in the duration of events, but showed more variability in timing. 5. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of a year-round perspective in identifying the most responsive characteristics or descriptors of thermal regimes in streams. The descriptors we provide herein can be applied across hydro-ecological regions to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in thermal regimes. Evaluation of coherence and synchrony of different components of thermal regimes can facilitate identification of impacts of regional climate variability or local human or natural influences.

The abundances of the representative species in the pond increased during high-temperature seasons, whereas only C. raciborskii became dominant in the pond from summer to autumn in both 2009 and 2010. The high shade tolerance of C. raciborskii was likely one of the factors that enabled the cyanobacterium to grow during the summer when the transparency was low. Moreover, the heterocyst production of C. raciborskii was enhanced during summer when the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was low, implying that nitrogen fixation also played an important role in supporting the growth of C. raciborskii. Autumnal rainfall was a critical factor in the collapse of C. raciborskii blooms. C. raciborskii formed blooms with relatively small trichomes, whereas larger trichomes dominated during winter. The dependence of the trade-off between growth rate and trichome size on temperature was assumed to be an adaptation strategy of C. raciborskii.

Stortrasket and a smaller Lilltrasket are lakes on the island Algo, and are part of the Tammisaari Archipelago Nature Reserve, SW Finland (web pages of the Finnish Board of the Environment; www.ymparisto.fi). Lake Stortrasket is small, shallow (max depth 4 m) water body with a high concentration of humic compounds. The lake is rather pristine; it has no river inflow and recreational activities such as fishing are forbidden. Water temperature in surface and 2 metres depth, and concentrations of nutrients (NO3-, NH4+, PO4+, and total-Si) were measured. A total number of 66 phytoplankton taxa (including 16 chrysophytes) were encountered in the water samples during the period of study. A clear succession of chrysophytes was detected: Uroglena sp. (Uroglenopsis americana?) and Synura spp. were particularly abundant in spring, while Dinobryon spp. and Chrysidiastrum catenatum increased in summer and in fall. Other abundant algae in Stortrasket (in summer and fall) were Merismopedia warmingiana (Cyanophyta), Monoraphidium spp. and Koliella spp. (Chlorophyta), and Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae).																			0029-5035						2005				128			189	196																WOS:000235193900012
J	Burian, ZV; Trokhymets, VM				Burian, Z. V.; Trokhymets, V. M.			The temporal dynamics of zooplankton communities of different types of water bodies within Ichniansky National Park	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												In recent decades, the influence of anthropogenic impact on aquatic ecosystems has increased. This has led to a restructuring of aquatic ecosystems and affected the structural and functional organization of groups of aquatic organisms, causing qualitative and quantitative changes. Particular attention is drawn to the different types of water bodies of protected areas like Ichnyansky National Park, which is located in Ichnyansky district of Chernihiv region. This park is a newly created one, so the reduction in intensity of anthropogenic pressure can be traced within its waters. Zooplankton plays an important role in the functioning of trophic networks because it transfers energy from producers and primary consumers to young fish and planktonophagous fish. Therefore, three main groups of zooplankton were chosen as the object of study: rotifers (class Eurotatoria), cladocerans (class Branchiopoda, order Cladocera), different age stages of copepods (class Copepoda), and also ostracods (Class Ostracoda). The zooplankton used as research material was collected in the daytime in spring (April), summer (late July - early August) and autumn (late September early October) in the years 2015-2016 from ten experimental stations. During this period 81 species of zooplankton were recorded within heterogeneous reservoirs of Ichniansky National Park. Monogonont rotifers (subclass Monogononta) included 35 species (43% of all species) and bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea), cladocerns, comprised 28 species (35%), and copepods included 18 species (22%). The faunal range of zooplankton over different years and seasons was characterized by the predominance of the rotator complex in spring, rotator-cladocerans and cladocerans in summer, and of the cladocerans complex in autumn. This was due to the formation during spring and summer of favourable conditions in the waters for filter feeders, which consist generally of rotifers and cladocerans. In autumn the water released large amounts of organic matter that caused a reduction in the species diversity of rotifers. Zooplankton also is characterized by the considerable ecological diversity. The range of environmental groups of zooplankton over two years was characterized by a predominance of the pelagic and benthic group of phytophiles. Pelagic representatives included 35 (43%) of 81 species, the bottom group - 20 (25%), phytophiles - 26 (32%). Rotifers dominated in the pelagic group - 18 (51%) species out of 35, and cladocerans - among the bottom group - 10 (50%) species out of 20. Zooplankton species also are distinguished by their feeding type. They represented three trophic groups: peaceful - 64 (79%) out of 81 species, omnivorous - 6 (7%) and predators - 11 (14%). Quantitative indicators of zooplankton at most stations in different seasons were defined as "very low" (less than 5,000 ind./m(3) and less than 0.3 g/m(3)), "low" (5,000-50,000 ind./m(3) and 0.3-1.0 g/m(3)), "below average" (5,000-50,000 ind./m(3) and 0.3-1.0 g/m(3)) rates, occasionally - "average" (51-250,000 ind./m(3) and 1.1-5.0 g/m(3)), "medium high" (501,000-1,000,000 ind./m(3) and 1.1-5.0 g/m3). High densities of zooplankton densities were recorded in spring for a temporary reservoir and amounted to 3,016,000 ind./m3.

J	Zhang, Q; Liu, XQ; Feng, SN				Zhang, Qi; Liu, Xingqi; Feng, Shengnan			Factors Influencing the Seasonal Flux of the Varved Sediments of Kusai Lake on the Northern Tibetan Plateau During the Last ∼2280 years	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The varved sediments of Kusai Lake on the northern Tibetan Plateau are rhythmically laminated with the interaction of dark and light layers formed during winter and summer within a year. This provides opportunities to explore the seasonal fluxes of varves and, thus, assess the potential for annual-resolution climate reconstruction. Here, we define a season index (SI) based on the difference in thickness between the light and dark layers, to evaluate the factors influencing the seasonal flux of varved Kusai Lake sediments. A positive SI represents more summer flux, and a negative SI indicates more winter flux. The results showed that the summer flux was higher than the winter flux in most of the last 2280 years. The summer flux had periodicities of approximately 2.3-2.9, 27, and 99 years at the 99% confidence level and approximately 15-16, 36 and 285 years at the 95% confidence level, indicating that summer flux is affected mainly by solar activity (Gleissberg and 350 unnamed cycle) at centennial scales, by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Pacific Decadal Oscillation with a period of 15-25 years) at decadal scales, and by the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (Quasi-biennial Oscillation with a period of 2-3 years) at interannual scales. Noticeable increasing spikes of high winter flux corresponded well to lower solar activity and stronger Siberian high pressure (SH). The periods of high and low winter flux are generally related to the negative and positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation respectively, during the last 1000 years.																				2296-6463				JAN 24	2022	9								823258	10.3389/feart.2021.823258	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.823258													WOS:000751864800001
J	Luoto, TP; Helama, S				Luoto, Tomi P.; Helama, Samuli			Palaeoclimatological and palaeolimnological records from fossil midges and tree-rings: the role of the North Atlantic Oscillation in eastern Finland through the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Hydrological changes and air temperature variability are reconstructed from the sediments of Lake Pieni-Kauro, eastern Finland during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA) using transfer functions derived from midge (Insecta: Nematocera)-based calibration models. The reconstructions are compared with a regional tree-ring chronology and sediment physical properties are determined to track depositional changes. An objective of the study is to examine the long-term relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and climate (temperature, precipitation). Our results show that the MCA was characterized by warm and dry summer conditions, which were accompanied by changes in the sediment magnetic susceptibility values most likely representing major forest fires during the tree-ring indicated MCA megadrought. However, the midge-based stream flow reconstruction shows increased values during the MCA, thus implying enhanced spring floods after snowy winters. During the LIA, the tree-ring data indicate that a generally wetter climate prevailed during summers, but the stream flow reconstruction indicates less snowy winters. In the terms of long-term climatology, the present results show support to the concept that the NAO has a positive correlation between winter precipitation and annual temperature and a negative correlation between summer precipitation in eastern Finland. Thus, the results may serve as important background data for global change assessments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Temperature cycles of leaves and air had mean diurnal amplitudes of 8.degree. C in summer and 17.degree. C in winter; cycles in water lagged behind and had amplitudes which decreased with depth. Most parts of S. molesta were warmer than the air at a nearby weather station most of the time and there was temperature stratification in the water during the warm part of each day. Standard meteorological variables were selected, using stepwise regression, to predict daily maximum and minimum temperature of S. molesta. Thermal inertia of water in the lake seemed to elevate S. molesta temperatures in autumn and depress them in spring compared with temperatures at the weather station. Better predictors were obtained by adding to meteorological variables a function based on the annual cycle of temperatures 10 cm below water level. Hourly temperatures experienced by S. molesta were predicted using curves fitted to diurnal cycles. The reliability of predictions was tested for each season of the year with independent data for a total of 78 days. Predicted temperatures were close to observed temperatures both in absolute terms and in terms of temperature-dependent growth rates of S. molesta.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1983	16	1					91	103		10.1016/0304-3770(83)90054-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(83)90054-2													WOS:A1983QV53400008

Marked blue discoloration of late winter ice and water due to autumn blooms of cyanobacteria	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Haig HA, Chegoonian AM, Davies J-M, Bateson D, Leavitt PR. 2021. Marked blue discoloration of late winter ice and water due to autumn blooms of cyanobacteria. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Continued eutrophication of inland waters by nutrient pollution can combine with unprecedented atmospheric and lake warming to create emergent environmental surprises. Here we report the first known occurrence of marked blue discoloration of ice and water in highly eutrophic prairie lakes during late winter 2021. Intense blue staining was reported first to governmental agencies by ice fishers in early March 2021, then communicated widely through social media, resulting in First Nations and public concern over potential septic field release, toxic spills, urban pollution, and agricultural mismanagement. Analysis of water from stained and reference sites using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that the blue color arose from high concentrations (similar to 14 mg/L) of the cyanobacterial pigment C-phycocyanin that was released after an unexpected bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in late October 2020 was frozen into littoral ice. Remote sensing using the Sentinel 3 A/B OLCI and Sentinel 2 A/B MSI satellite platforms suggested that blue staining encompassed 0.68 +/- 0.24 km(2) (4.25 +/- 1.5% of lake surface area), persisted over 4 weeks, and was located within 50 m of the lakeshore in regions where fall blooms of cyanobacteria had been particularly dense. Although toxin levels were low (similar to 0.2 mu g microcystin/L), high concentrations of C-phycocyanin raised public concern over eutrophication, pollution, and climate change, and resulted in rapid governmental and academic response. Given that climate change and nutrient pollution are increasing the magnitude and duration of cyanobacterial blooms, blue staining of lake ice may become widespread in eutrophic lakes subject to ice cover.					; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Chegoonian, Amir Masoud/HNT-0012-2023; Davies, John-Mark/ABK-5960-2022	Chegoonian, Amir Masoud/0000-0003-0862-2763; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Sauer, Heather/0000-0002-0208-8179; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2022	38	1					1	15		10.1080/10402381.2021.1992544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2021.1992544		OCT 2021											WOS:000719648000001

Seasonal habitat selection by lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a small Canadian shield lake: constraints imposed by winter conditions	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					1st International Winter Limnology Symposium	MAY 24-28, 2008	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLAND	Univ Jyvaskyla, Univ Joensuu, Univ Helsinki	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn			The need for cold, well-oxygenated waters significantly reduces the habitat available for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) during stratification of small temperate lakes. We examined the spatial and pelagic distribution of lake trout over two consecutive summers and winters and tested whether winter increased habitat availability and access to littoral regions in a boreal shield lake in which pelagic prey fish are absent. In winter, lake trout had a narrowly defined pelagic distribution that was skewed to the upper 3 m of the water column and spatially situated in the central region of the lake. Individual core areas of use (50% Kernel utilization distributions) in winter were much reduced (75%) and spatially non-overlapping compared to summer areas, but activity levels were similar between seasons. Winter habitat selection is in contrast to observations from the stratified season, when lake trout were consistently located in much deeper waters (> 6 m) and widely distributed throughout the lake. Winter distribution of lake trout appeared to be strongly influenced by ambient light levels; snow depth and day length accounted for up to 69% of the variation in daily median fish depth. More restricted habitat use during winter than summer was in contrast to our original prediction and illustrates that a different suite of factors influence lake trout distribution between these seasons.

The assessment of phytoplankton functional groups may help water resource management, considering the multiple uses of this resource type. This research investigated the seasonal variation of these groups in the Itupararanga Reservoir (SP, Brazil). Four arms of the reservoir were sampled to determine the water temperature, pH, underwater Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), turbidity, total phosphorus, nitrate and total suspended solids (TSS), besides qualitative and quantitative aspects of the phytoplankton community and meteorological data. The study was carried out in August and October 2009, and in February 2010, and suggested there is seasonal variation of phytoplankton groups (P-star<0.05), with the predominance of organisms Sn, XI, M and F (winter), XI, Y, F and K (spring) and XI, J, K and W2 (summer). The main variables that influenced the abundance of groups in the winter and in the spring were TSS (7.4 to 48.1 mg L-1) and turbidity (7 to 96 UT). Temperature (27.8 to 29.1 degrees C), pH (from 7.7 to 9.8) and PAR (>1000 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) were relevant in the summer. Considering the environmental variability of the arms of the reservoir (derived from the influence of tributaries), and the dominance of phytoplankton groups typical of eutrophic environments, we recommend continuous monitoring of this area so that different water uses can continue, particularly for supply and recreation.

J	Harrison, SSC; Bradley, DC; Harris, IT				Harrison, SSC; Bradley, DC; Harris, IT			Uncoupling strong predator-prey interactions in streams: the role of marginal macrophytes	OIKOS												Predation refugia can facilitate the coexistence of predators and prey within an ecosystem by weakening trophic links between the two. The marginal macrophytes of shallow lakes are used facultatively by zooplankton to escape fish predation, leading to the stabilisation of lentic food webs. Little is known about such a role for the marginal macrophytes of lotic systems. In this paper, we examine whether the marginal macrophytes of chalk streams help buffer the interaction between the freshwater shrimp, Gammarus pulex and a benthic fish predator, Cottus gobio, both characteristically abundant in such systems. Quantitative surveys were taken of Gammarus and bullheads in winter and summer in a southern English chalk stream. These indicated that Gammarus seasonally switched their habitat preference, from marginal macrophytes in summer, to midchannel habitats in winter. Bullheads exhibited an opposite trend, preferring midchannel habitats in summer and all habitats, particularly marginal macrophytes, in winter. Large Gammarus and precopula pairs were found almost exclusively in the margins in summer. This spatial separation between Gammarus and bullheads in summer, though not in winter, was reflected in bullhead diets, as determined by gut analysis. In field manipulation experiments, bullhead presence was the strongest factor explaining the between-habitat distribution of Gammarus in both summer and winter, indicating that the habitat shift of Gammarus was driven by the distribution of fish. Other abundant invertebrate taxa, including Asellus, mayflies and chironomids, exhibited little avoidance of habitat patches of high bullhead density. We conclude that marginal macrophytes in chalk streams can potentially facilitate the coexistence of high densities of both Gammarus and bullheads by spatially separating predator and prey in summer. They may further allow large populations of Gammarus to persist in the presence of high bullhead density at stretch-wide spatial scales, by reducing the predation by bullheads of large breeding and newly born individuals of Gammarus in summer.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				MAR	2005	108	3					433	448		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.12189.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.12189.x													WOS:000226898200001

However, large model uncertainties, limited long-term observations, and high spatiotemporal variability limit our understanding of these mechanisms, emphasizing the need for paleoclimate records of precipitation changes. Here we use lipid biomarkers in lake sediments to reconstruct precipitation seasonality in northern Spitsbergen, Svalbard. We measured the hydrogen isotopic ratios (delta H-2) of n-alkanoic acids (C-20-C-30) from sedimentary leaf waxes in lake Austre Nevlingen, Spitsbergen. We interpret delta H-2 values of mid-chain (C-22) and long-chain (C-28) n-alkanoic acids to represent delta H-2 of lake and soil water, respectively. Austre Nevlingen lake water delta H-2 reflects amount-weighted mean annual precipitation delta H-2. In contrast, soil water is mostly recharged by summer rainfall, and therefore reflects delta H-2 values of summer precipitation. Austre Nevlingen leaf wax delta H-2 values are 2H-depleted in the Early Holocene, suggesting high winter precipitation amounts. This coincides with high summer insolation, strong Atlantic water advection and reduced spring sea-ice cover in surrounding waters. Winter precipitation continued to dominate until c. 6 cal. kyr BP. After 6 cal. kyr BP, the trend in the biomarker record is not as clear. This could be related to colder conditions causing longer duration of seasonal lake-ice cover, thereby influencing the precipitation seasonality registered by the lake water. The Austre Nevlingen record suggests a close relationship between precipitation seasonality and regional ocean surface conditions, consistent with simulations suggesting that Arctic winter sea-ice loss will lead to increased local evaporation.

Pallasea quadrispinosa now populates at least ten lakes in the River Umealven and Gammaracanthus lacustris has established sparse populations in two lakes in the River Indalsalven. The distribution of P. quadrispinosa in reservoirs was similar to that in the donor lake, with adults moving to deeper, cooler water in summer. The amphipods had an omnivorous diet, with a preference for zooplankton. They were in turn consumed by the major fish species. They were most important as prey in autumn and winter. Brown trout and Arctic char have become more numerous in the reservoirs, but the mean size of these fish has decreased. Introductions of P. quadrispinosa have spread the fish parasite Cystidicola sp. G. lacustris was found in small numbers on deep bottoms in the Hackren reservoir. This species seems to have a two-year life cycle, with the reproductive period starting in summer and ending in winter when the young are released. The adults of this species preyed on zooplankton, chironomid larvae and P. quadrispinosa. The only fish species to prey regularly on G. lacustris was burbot.																			0003-455X						1990	27	3					241	244																WOS:A1990ER36200010
J	Mulchandani, A; Westerhoff, P				Mulchandani, Anjali; Westerhoff, Paul			Geospatial Climatic Factors Influence Water Production of Solar Desiccant Driven Atmospheric Water Capture Devices	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Atmospheric water capture (AWC) can provide clean drinking water in locations not connected to the centralized water grid for disaster relief, rural, military, and other applications. The atmosphere contains 14% of the equivalent freshwater volume stored in lakes and rivers and is universally accessible without pipelines or dams. A growing number of solar-based materials and devices to capture water vapor off the electrical grid have been reported, all of which assume varying relative humidity, solar irradiance, and desiccant materials (e.g., silica gel, zeolite, metal organic frameworks). This work uses Monte Carlo simulations and geospatial mapping to integrate material and system parameters from literature with United States spatial and temporal climate data to pinpoint key driving parameters for solar desiccant driven AWC and forecast atmospheric water harvesting potential (L/m(2)/day). Solar irradiance provides energy to desorb water vapor adsorbed to desiccants and determines maximum AWC capacity with respect to location and season; 4-8 L/m(2) system footprint/day can be captured across the United States in spring and summer, while capacity lowers to 0-5 L/m(2)/day in fall and winter. Desiccants can be designed with Langmuir specific surface area >1500 m(2)/g and Langmuir constant (k(L)) > 0.1 to adsorb water vapor and meet these maximum potentials.					; Westerhoff, Paul/AAF-1850-2019; Mulchandani, Ashok/B-9692-2016	Mulchandani, Anjali/0000-0001-6529-8336; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 7	2020	54	13					8310	8322		10.1021/acs.est.0c00534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c00534								32433870					WOS:000548584900060
J	SANDJENSEN, K; BORUM, J				SANDJENSEN, K; BORUM, J			EPIPHYTE SHADING AND ITS EFFECT ON PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND DIEL METABOLISM OF LOBELIA-DORTMANNA L DURING THE SPRING BLOOM IN A DANISH LAKE	AQUATIC BOTANY												A dense epiphyte community develops on L. dortmanna L. during spring in the mesotrophic waters of Lake Almind, Denmark. This community has attenuated the incident light at 0.5 m depth by 67.4-81.7% within 2 yr. The attenuation is spectrally selective, the proportion of red light transmitted increasing the epiphyte density. Epiphyte attenuation reduces the photosynthesis of Lobelia by increasing the light-compensation point and the saturation light intensity at the surface. These effects are predictable from epiphyte attenuations measured in suspensions scraped from the leaves of Lobelia and on the basis of photosynthesis-light relationships. Epiphyte attenuation and reduction of Lobellia photosynthesis are proportional in low light intensities (i.e., low surface light and/or high epiphyte attenuation) and independent in saturation light. The estimated light-compensation point for diel metabolism of Lobelia during spring was 3.33-3.66 E m-2 day-1 at 0.5 m depth, close to the natural level in the lake. Apparently Lobelia grows only slowly during spring and resumes growth subsequently during summer and autumn, when epiphyte density decreases due to N and P limitation. The depth limit of Lobelia was 1.0 m. Without epiphyte attenuation, the daily light-compensation point during spring would occur at 3.5 m. Epiphyte attenuation may be important as concerns the seasonal growth and depth penetration of host macrophytes.

Louise			Increases in lake phytoplankton biomass caused by future climate-driven changes to seasonal river flow	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												For the many lakes world-wide with short residence times, changes to the rate of water throughput may have important effects on lake ecology. We studied relationships between current and predicted residence times and phytoplankton biomass using a eutrophic lake in the north-west of England with an annual residence time averaging about 20 days, as a test case. Using 32 years of recent hydrological flow data for Bassenthwaite Lake, multiple sets of scaled flow for each year, and the process-based phytoplankton response model, PROTECH, we modelled the effects of changing river flow on phytoplankton biomass in the lake. The impact on biomass was shown to depend on seasonal changes in flow rather than annual changes. Furthermore, there was a qualitative difference in impact depending on whether the nutrient loading to the lake came principally from flow-independent sources, or from flow-dependent ones. Predictions for changes in river flow under future climate scenarios in the north-west of England have suggested that, despite little change in the annual flow magnitude, there will be a shift to greater flow in the winter and lesser flow in the summer. Applying these flow predictions to our modelling of Bassenthwaite Lake revealed that, with flow-independent nutrient loading, and no overall increase in nutrient load, phytoplankton abundance in the summer could increase by up to 70%, including an increased proportion of Cyanobacteria. Conversely, were the loading completely dependent on the flow, the biomass would fall. In many parts of the world, river flow is expected to decrease in the summer even more than in England, suggesting these areas may expect substantial changes to seasonal phytoplankton biomass as a result of climate-driven changes to seasonal river flow. Such changes would be in addition to any other changes owing to warming effects or eutrophication.

J	Zhang, M; Chen, FZ; Shi, XL; Yang, Z; Kong, FX				Zhang, Min; Chen, Feizhou; Shi, Xiaoli; Yang, Zhen; Kong, Fanxiang			Association between temporal and spatial beta diversity in phytoplankton	ECOGRAPHY												The rates of temporal and spatial species turnover have been compared in different organisms and scales, revealing that both are not independent but, rather, associated. However, the knowledge is limited for the association between spatial turnover and temporal turnover. Here, we performed two investigations of the phytoplankton composition in the lakes of the Yangtze River catchment in China in the spring and summer of 2012, which covered regional spatial scale and two-season temporal scale. We analysed the association between temporal and spatial species turnover in phytoplankton. The results showed that 1) the two-season temporal turnover of phytoplankton varied based on the mean values and the coefficient of variance of environmental variables, and pH was the most important variable negatively affecting the temporal turnover; 2) the spatial beta diversity of phytoplankton in summer was higher than that in spring, and the distance decay pattern was significant in summer, but not in spring; 3) the variation in spatial turnover in spring and summer was attributed to the primary environmental variables (nitrogen, phosphorus and underwater available light) and broader-scale spatial variables; 4) the proportion of jointly explained variation of spatial Bray-Curtis dissimilarity by the environment and space increased from similar to 38% (spring) to similar to 55% (summer), which was mainly due to the variation in spatially structured environmental variables during the two-season temporal turnover, such as pH and ion concentrations; 5) the community compositions in summer were more similar between the lakes with similar two-season temporal turnover. These results indicate that the spatial turnover of phytoplankton composition in summer was partially predetermined by the variation in environmental variables and phytoplankton composition during the process of two-season temporal turnover, and highlight the understanding of temporal variations in spatial beta diversity as well as the underlying assembly mechanisms in phytoplankton.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023														0906-7590	1600-0587				AUG	2018	41	8					1345	1356		10.1111/ecog.03340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.03340													WOS:000440287200010
J	GAUDY, R; PAGANO, M				GAUDY, R; PAGANO, M			BIOLOGY OF A COPEPOD OF THE TEMPORARY LAKES OF THE FRENCH MEDITERRANEAN LITTORAL - EURYTEMORA-VELOX .3. REPRODUCTION	MARINE BIOLOGY												The reproduction of Eurytemora velox, a brackish copepod from temporary lakes of the south of France, was studied in winter and spring 1978, under various temperature and salinity conditions, using Chlorella sp. and Amphidinium sp. as food. Maximum numbers of successive eggs sacs (9), eggs per sac (39.3) and total egg production per female (311) were recorded for the winter generation, only 4.8, 34.8 and 109, respectively, for the spring generation. In contrast, the number of eggs per female per day was highest (11.3) in the spring generation, which displayed a more rapid reproductive cycle. Despite strong individual variations in the rhythm of egg sac production and in abundance of eggs per sac, egg production was generally higher during the first third of adult life, attaining a maximum after production of the second or the third egg sac. The continuous presence of the males was necessary to assure complete fertilization of eggs throughout the whole life of adults females. Hatching rate displayed high individual variability, in particular for the spring generation, which had lower average hatching rates (between 0 and 26%, depending on salinity or temperature) than the winter generation (14 to 64%). These differences may be related to the ability of E. velox to produce resting eggs during spring, allowing the species to maintain itself in a temporary water milieu. Temperature significantly affected longevity and daily egg production of females; presence or absence of males did not affect these parameters. An increase in salinity from 20 to 30.permill. reduced longevity, number of egg sacs, and daily egg production in the winter generation, but not in the spring generation. The specific daily production of females during their adult life was calculated from the egg production:biomass ratio of females, in carbon units. In the winter generation, this ratio increased between 10.degree. and 15.degree.C compared to ratios between 15.degree. and 20.degree.C; the opposite was observed for the spring generation. The seasonal differences in the effects of temperature and salinity on reproduction could indicate an adaptation mechanism to the strongly thermal and haline seasonal fluctuations which characterize the habitat of E. velox (brackish waters, drying-up in summer). Larval mortality was high, except at 20.permill. S for the spring generation. The sex-ratio of the offspring was unaffected by variations in breeding conditions. Hatching time and development time of larvae could be described by two Belehradek equations displaying close b and (.alpha.) coefficients. We calculated the energy balance of adult females from data obtained in a previous study on feeding and respiration in E. velox, and this is discussed in context with the egg production results. Net growth efficiency varied with algal concentration according to an asymptotic curve, reaching a maximum of 0.43 with Tetraselmis maculata as food or 0.53 with Amphidinium sp. Actual egg production rate obtained in the present study was in good agreement with that calculated by the difference between assimilated food and respiration expenses.																			0025-3162	1432-1793					1987	94	3					335	345		10.1007/BF00428239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00428239													WOS:A1987G973000003

Effects of lunar cycles on the activity patterns and depth use of a temperate sport fish, the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY					7th Conference on Fish Telemetry	JUN 17-21, 2007	Silkeborg, DENMARK					The behaviour of free-swimming, telemetered, adult largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides (L.), was monitored using a whole lake, three-dimensional acoustic telemetry array to test the hypothesis that fish activity and depth distribution are influenced by lunar phase. The percent of lunar face shining and whether the moon was waxing or waning were significant determinants of swimming activity and depth distribution during most of the lunar cycles evaluated, although these patterns were not consistent across the year. In spring and summer, daily depth distribution followed a pattern in which the fish inhabited greater depths on the 26-50% and 51-75% waxing moon. Fish daily movement distances were five times greater during spring and summer than in winter, but no repeatable patterns were noted in relation to lunar periodicity. This research suggests that solunar tables frequently consulted by recreational anglers may have little predictive value for identifying peak fishing time.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Hasler, Caleb/H-6066-2019	Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0969-997X	1365-2400				OCT-DEC	2008	15	5-6					357	364		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2008.00634.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2008.00634.x													WOS:000260306900005

Water quality monitoring of Al-Habbaniyah Lake using remote sensing and in situ measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The use of remote sensing and GIS in water monitoring and management has been long recognized. This paper, however discusses the application of remote sensing and GIS specifically in monitoring water quality parameters in Al-Habbaniyah Lake, and the results were compared with in situ measurements. Variations of different parameters under investigation were as follows: temperature (15-33 degrees C), pH (7-9), dissolved oxygen (6-11mg/L), BOD5 (0.5-1.8), electrical conductivity (200-2280 mu S/cm), TDS (1471520 mg/L), TSS (68-3200), turbidity (5-51), nitrate (0.7-20 mg/l), phosphate (77-220 mu g/l), and chlorophyll-a (0.9-130 mu g/l). Remote sensing results revealed that the band 5 was most likely significantly correlated with turbidity in the winter. Band 2 and 3 was most likely significantly correlated with TDS in autumn and summer, while band 2 was most likely significantly correlated with TSS in autumn, band 2 is most likely significantly correlated with chlorophyll-a in autumn. The current study results demonstrated convergence between in situ and remote sensing readings. The models were used to explore the values of each of chlorophyll-a, TSS, TDS, and turbidity did not deviate much from the values actually measured in the three seasons. Nevertheless, they were very useful in anticipating all seasons of the study due to the insignificant deviation between the remotely sensed values and actual measured values.

J	Scharf, W				Scharf, Wilfried			The use of nutrient reduction and food-web management to improve water quality in the deep stratifying Wupper Reservoir, Germany	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Only a combination of nutrient load abatement and food-web management proved efficient for the management of water quality in the deep stratifying Wupper Reservoir. Reduction of nutrient loading, was completed in winter 1992/1993, but resulted only in reduced winter/spring mixing of phosphorus concentrations. Since the capacity of the diatom spring bloom to remove nutrients from the trophogenic layer of this slightly eutrophic water-body was never exhausted, the surplus of total phosphorus available to support summer algal growth remained unchanged. Thus, nutrient reduction alone did not improve the water quality, as expected. Subsequent replacement of the smaller Daphnia cucullata by the larger Daphnia galeata-hyalina complex that was attributable to successful food-web management did, however, result in a shift from a turbid to a clear water regime in 1999. Clearly, the zooplankton community, and therefore food-web structure, played an integral role in nutrient recycling and in the repartitioning of the phosphorus pool. As diatom settling and grazing became much more tightly linked with the appearance of the larger-bodied Daphnia galeata-hyalina complex, which exploits lower-level food resources as early as May, daphnids increasingly acted as a sink for phosphorus. This increased export fluxes out of the pelagic zone and leaves a smaller surplus of total phosphorus to support the accumulation of summer algae. Consequently, water transparency and total chlorophyll concentrations in summer improved with food-web restructuring, indicating real oligotrophication of Wupper Reservoir driven by internal feedbacks.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2008	603						105	115		10.1007/s10750-007-9250-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9250-7													WOS:000254088900007

Solid phase extraction was applied for the isolation and pre-concentration of target compounds in water samples. Surface waters of the lakes located in Northern Greece (Volvi, Doirani, and Kerkini), were collected in two time periods (fall/winter 2010 and spring/summer 2011) and analyzed, applying the developed analytical methods. Spatial distribution of detected pesticides was visualized using interpolation methods and geographical information systems (GIS). Pesticides with maximum concentrations were amitrole, propoxur, simazine, chlorpyrifos, carbendazim, triazophos, disulfoton-sulfone, pyridaben, sebuthylazine, terbuthylazine, atrazine, atrazine-desethyl, bensulfuron-methyl, metobromuron, metribuzin, rotenone, pyriproxyfen, and rimsulfuron. In Lake Kerkini, mainly carbamates and triazines were determined at elevated concentrations, near the coastal point of the NW side of the lake. Seasonal variations were strong among the applied pesticide classes and determined concentrations, indicating the contribution of pesticide application patterns and rainfall. Lake Doirani exhibited organophosphate pesticides at higher concentrations mainly at coastal points, while triazines emerged as the main pollutant during spring sampling. Lake Volvi exhibited the highest pesticide concentrations, mostly triazines and ureas at the central part of the lake. The occurrence of extreme values and nonconstant seasonal variations indicated that the concentrations were increased disproportionately during the second sampling, as a result of the varying contribution of pollution sources right after the application period. In all cases, the total concentration of pesticides increased during the second sampling period.

Size fractionated algal primary production and exudation were measured as well as bacterial production in order to calculate the amount of carbon covering the bacterial carbon demand by primary production. The impact of bacterivorous protozoans and metazoans was estimated by comparison of the calculated feeding rate and the bacterial production. Our results show a shift within the metabolic interactions of the microbial food web from winter/spring to summer, indicating a high significance of the protozooplankton as a regulator on bacteria during the colder season, whereas from early summer the influence of metazooplankton dominated by cladocerans was evident in this eutrophic lake.

Today, the Rideau Canal is managed by Parks Canada and remains an engineered ecosystem, particularly in the urban Ottawa reach (7 km long) where it is largely channelized and is partially drained during the winter to protect canal infrastructure (i.e., locks) and provide recreational opportunities (i.e., skating). Interestingly, the Ottawa reach of the Rideau Canal supports one of the few wild urban muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) fisheries in North America supported by natural reproduction. However, little is known about the spatial ecology, residency patterns or survival of this apex freshwater predator in urban environments or canal systems. Radio-telemetry was used to study adult (N = 10; total size range of 64 to 122 cm) muskellunge in the Ottawa reach of the Rideau Canal over a multiple year period. The seasonal movements and home range of muskellunge were greatest during spring corresponding with the period when water levels in the canal were raised and muskellunge were presumably seeking out suitable spawning habitats following ice-off. During the summer fish ranged throughout the entire 7 km urban reach of the canal and by early fall muskellunge moved to the deeper parts of the reach and became largely restricted to an embayment known as Dow's Lake prior to the lowering of the canal where they stayed for the entire winter. The same pattern of seasonal movements persisted across several years. None of the tagged muskellunge were stranded from the fall canal drainage. One fish emigrated from the urban reach of the canal during the study period, moving upstream through a lock to an exurban reach. In addition, a single tagged fish died from a winterkill event. Environmental influences such as seasonality and water depth (associated with canal operations) are believed to be the primary mechanisms contributing to habitat selection and movement patterns of muskellunge in this reach of the Rideau Canal. Data on the spatial ecology of muskellunge in the urban reaches of the Rideau Canal will inform management of this unique population of fish to ensure that the historic and ecological values are balanced to preserve this iconic Canadian natural heritage site and its biota.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Hasler, Caleb/H-6066-2019	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0990-7440					APR-JUN	2010	23	2					225	230		10.1051/alr/2010019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr/2010019													WOS:000280167100009

The goal of this study was to determine the summer and winter phytoplankton community structure, cyanotoxin presence, and toxigenicity in a eutrophic lake susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms throughout the year, using classical microscopy, an analysis of toxic cyanometabolites, and an analysis of genes involved in biosynthesis of cyanotoxins. We also assessed whether cyanobacterial diversity in the studied lake has changed compared to what was reported in previous reports conducted several years ago. Moreover, the bloom-forming cyanobacterial strains were isolated from the lake and screened for cyanotoxin presence and toxigenicity. Cyanobacteria were the main component of the phytoplankton community in both sampling times, and, in particular, Oscillatoriales were predominant in both summer (Planktothrix/Limnothrix) and winter (Limnothrix) sampling. Compared to the winter community, the summer community was denser; richer in species; and contained alien and invasive Nostocales, including Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides, Raphidiopsis raciborskii, and Raphidiopsis mediterranea. In both sampling times, the blooms contained toxigenic species with genetic determinants for the production of cylindrospermopsin and microcystins. Toxicological screening revealed the presence of microcystins in the lake in summer but no cyanotoxins in the winter period of sampling. However, several cyanobacterial strains isolated from the lake during winter and summer produced anabaenopeptins and microcystins. This study indicates that summer and winter blooms of cyanobacteria in the temperate zone can differ in biomass, structure, and toxicity, and that the toxic hazards associated with cyanobacterial blooms may potentially exist during winter.					; Wejnerowski, Łukasz/K-1886-2019; Rybak, Michał/AAC-1750-2022; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Meriluoto, Jussi/A-5309-2008	Dulic, Tamara/0000-0001-8296-1638; Jurczak, Tomasz/0000-0002-1576-6741; Rybak, Michal/0000-0001-7957-184X; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Meriluoto, Jussi/0000-0002-6300-301X														2072-6651				AUG	2024	16	8							357	10.3390/toxins16080357	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins16080357								39195767					WOS:001304826500001

CH4 and CO2 Fluxes from the Surface of Boreal Lakes in the Arkhangelsk Region in Spring and Summer	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY												The paper presents the estimates of spatial and seasonal variability of the greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2) fluxes into the atmosphere from the boreal lake surface and the volume of these emissions in the spring and summer of 2022. The lakes of the Arkhangelsk region with different morphometric, hydrological, and hydrochemical characteristics were chosen as the objects of the study. The results showed that the CH4 fluxes from the lake surface varied in the ranges of 0.39-3.7 mg/m(2) per day (spring) and 2.7-12.4 mg/m(2) per day (summer), while the CO2 fluxes varied within 0.48-16.8 g/m(2) per day (spring) and -0.47...14.1 g/m(2) per day (summer). Specific CH4 fluxes were smaller in the spring, while CO2 fluxes were smaller in the summer, when several humic lakes became a sink for CO2. Depending on a season, the spatial variability of CH4 and CO2 fluxes reached 72 and 188%, respectively. It has been shown that spatial variability can introduce significant uncertainty into the estimated values of emissions: by 2.7 times for CH4 and by 3-6 times for CO2.					; Zabelina, Svetlana/A-8851-2014; Klimov, Sergey/B-2191-2014; Chupakov, Artem/A-9191-2014; Prasolov, Sergey/LTN-0119-2024	Zabelina, Svetlana/0000-0001-7160-0618; Prasolov, Sergey/0009-0007-6826-9048; 													1068-3739	1934-8096				OCT	2024	49	10					914	922		10.3103/S1068373924100091	http://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S1068373924100091													WOS:001385871200006

TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THE CLONAL STRUCTURE OF A NATURAL-POPULATION	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) Temporal changes in the frequencies of different clones (distinguished electrophoretically) of a natural shallow-lake population of Daphnia magna are described in relation to seasonal environmental changes monitored at six sites from July 1981 to July 1983. (2) Extensive, and sometimes rapid, changes occurred in the number of clones present and in clone size. Changes in clonal structure were remarkably uniform throughout the lake suggesting frequency changes in response to temporal environmental changes. There were no persistent aggregations of particular clones within spatially distinctive areas of the lake. Principal component analysis indicated that the abundance of certain clones was strongly influenced by seasonal variables, notably temperature and population density. (3) The population contained a few dominant, and many rare clonal groups. Three dominant clonal groups exhibited seasonal succession over two years, predominating respectively in summer, autumn and winter. Other genotypes either persisted throughout each year at variable densities, or were rare and apparently short-lived. (4) Clonal diversity, expressed as the Shannon-Wiener index and the number of clones recognized, was higher in summer and lower in winter, as was the total population density. (5) This study demonstrates rapid genetic changes, and suggests that ecological generalists, opportunists, and seasonal specialists may coexist within a single, primarily parthenogenetic Daphnia population. The manner in which such varied types of clone arise and fluctuate is discussed.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				JUN	1987	56	2					453	468		10.2307/5060	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5060													WOS:A1987H552300007

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is home to thousands of lakes and is highly sensitive to climate change. Therefore, the response of these lakes to a warming climate is crucial for the water security and ecological stability of the "Asian Water Tower". However, the long-term trend of LST and its driving factors on the TP over the past two decades remain unclear. Here, we employ an all-weather land surface temperature dataset and a representative lake method to investigate the interannual trend of LST on the TP from 2000 to 2022. The analysis uses temperature data from 519 to 581 lakes with interannual dynamic changes in surface area. The results show that lakes on the TP exhibit an overall warming trend, with an average rate of 0.10 +/- 0.27 degrees C (10 a)(-1). Among the representative lakes, 61% show a warming trend. The most significant warming occurs in autumn, with 91% of the representative lakes showing an increase in LST (0.47 +/- 0.30 degrees C (10 a)(-1)). The warming rate in spring is about half of that in autumn. In winter, the LST trend exhibits a polarized pattern: although some lakes experience significant warming, more than half show intense cooling. In summer, the trend of LST change is more moderate than that in other seasons. The positive feedback from the reduction in lake ice duration drives the LST trend on the TP. The lake ice duration reduces every 10-day, the annual LST increases 0.4 degrees C. Additionally, altitude and lake expansion can also influence LST changes. Lakes at lower altitudes generally experience higher warming trends. Lake expansion can exacerbate lake warming in autumn by enhancing thermal inertia and delaying lake freeze-up.

J	SHEFLER, D; REICH, K				SHEFLER, D; REICH, K			GROWTH OF SILVER CARP (HYPOPHTALMICHTHYS-MOLITRIX) IN LAKE KINNERET IN 1969 - 1975	BAMIDGEH												Silver carp grown in Kinneret from 1969-1975 had a growth rate not different from that of other fish ponds. The silver carp grew better during 1969-1971 than during the period of intensive stocking in 1972-1974. This may be an error originating in an inaccurate sampling. Therefore, it might be advisable during the next few years to check whether increased silver carp stocking of Kinneret affects it growth rate. There is a striking difference in weight of fish of identical age. Some of this variance may be explained by a difference in stocking date and fingerling weight. However, there may be genetic variances among the fish which by selection and breeding stock improvement would enable better and uniform growth. It is possible to estimate the growth of silver carp in future years. Silver carp introduced into the Kinneret during July-Aug. would reach a weight of about 400 g during the following spring. During the 1st summer, there would be an increment of about 2 kg, the fish reaching an average weight of 2.5 kg by winter. Due to the varied growth rate of the individual carp, some would weigh only 1.5 kg while others would prematurely attain a weight of 4 kg. During winter when the temperature drops to 15-16.degree. C, the fish would only barely grow, during the 2nd summer the growth rate would accelerate and by winter most of the fish would reach a weight of 5-6 kg. During the 3rd summer, rapid growth would continue so that by winter an additional increase in weight of 3 kg/fish could be expected. Due to non-uniform growth, the individual differences among the fish would also increase so that by the beginning of winter (the fish being 40-41 mo. old) they would weigh between 6.5-10.5 kg. They would undoubtedly continue to grow when at 4 or 5 yr old it could be assumed that the maximum weight would reach about 20 kg. The percentage of viability in the stocking experiments was relatively low. Means of increasing it should be sought, especially nursing of fingerlings in ponds to a weight of 1 or more grams, and by stocking as early as possible. In winter and spring, newly stocked silver carp fingerlings are caught in various gill nets. Concerted efforts must be made to avoid the destruction of these young silver carp.																			0005-4577						1977	29	1					3	16																WOS:A1977DM28700001
J	Allen, RC; Gellasch, CA				Allen, Rose C.; Gellasch, Christopher A.			Identifying Relative Groundwater Contributions to Michigan Glacial Wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Wetlands are complex ecosystems that are dependent on hydrologic processes and affected by water chemistry. The Fish Lake Environmental Education Center near Lapeer, MI, is glacially influenced and contains a large bog and multiple kettles that contain ephemeral wetlands in the spring. Previous studies indicated that groundwater flow direction at the southern end of the site is towards Fish Lake, but the extent to which groundwater and surface water are interacting with the wetlands north of the lake is unclear. The goal of this project was to understand the relative contributions of precipitation and groundwater in the bog and kettle wetlands north of Fish Lake. Groundwater and surface water samples were collected monthly in the fall and winter and biweekly in the spring and summer between May 2022 and September 2023. Values of pH, electrical conductivity, water levels, nitrate, nitrite, phosphorus, and iron were analyzed and used to determine water source. Sites with low pH and low electrical conductivity were determined to be precipitation influenced. Conceptual site models based on project data suggest that the wetlands to the north are more precipitation sourced and become more heavily groundwater influenced to the south towards the lake. Glaciated regions of the Upper Midwest with similar topography can apply these methods to determine relative sources of water in different wetlands.																			1078-7275	1558-9161				AUG	2025	31	3					223	234		10.21663/EEG-D-24-00056	http://dx.doi.org/10.21663/EEG-D-24-00056													WOS:001529668800004

It is increasingly important to regulate water quality in urban development. The Forel-Ule Index (FUI) can be obtained by optical data and is an important indicator. Therefore, we used Sentinel-2 to calculate the FUI of 41 lakes and reservoirs in Guangzhou and Shenzhen from January to December in 2016-2021, and analyzed their spatio-temporal variations, including spatial distributions, seasonal variations, and inter-annual variations. We also performed a correlation analysis of driving factors. In Guangzhou, the FUI was low in the north and west, and high in the south and east. In Shenzhen, the FUI was high in the west and low in the east. Moreover, 68% of the lakes and reservoirs in Guangzhou exhibited seasonal variations, with a low FUI in summer and autumn, and high levels in spring and winter. Shenzhen had the lowest FUI in autumn. Furthermore, 36% of the lakes and reservoirs in Guangzhou exhibited increasing inter-annual variations, whereas Shenzhen exhibited stable and decreasing inter-annual variations. Among the 41 lakes and reservoirs analyzed herein, the FUI of 10 water areas were positively correlated with precipitation, while the FUI of 31 water areas were negatively correlated with precipitation. Increased precipitation leads to an increase in external pollutants and sediment, as well as the resuspension of substances in the water, resulting in more turbid water. Therefore, an increase in precipitation is positively correlated with the FUI, whereas a decrease in precipitation is negatively correlated with the FUI. These findings can be used to design suitable management policies to maintain and control the local water quality.					; Zhao, Yelong/HCH-5075-2022; Chen, Jinsong/AIE-7696-2022	, lixiaoli/0009-0007-3598-941X; Zhao, Yelong/0000-0003-0648-351X														2076-3417				AUG	2023	13	15							9039	10.3390/app13159039	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app13159039													WOS:001046186000001

Previous studies on cyanobacteria in Lake Taihu often collected samples from one site (like Meiliang Bay or Zhushan Bay) and focused on the variation in patterns or abundance of Microcystis during the blooming season. However, the distribution of cyanobacteria in Lake Taihu shows differing pattern in various seasons. In this study, water samples were collected monthly for one year at five sites in Lake Taihu with different trophic status and a physicochemical analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were conducted. DGGE fingerprint analysis showed that Microcystis (7/35 bands) and Synechococcus (12/35 bands) were the two most dominant genera present during the study period at all five sites. Cyanobium (3/35 bands) was the third most common genus which has seldom been previously reported in Lake Taihu. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the cyanobacterial community structure was significantly correlated with NO3--N, CODMn, and NH4+-N in the winter and spring, whereas it was correlated with water temperature in the summer and autumn. Limiting the nutrient input (especially of N and C loading) in Lake Taihu would be a key factor in controlling the growth of different genera of cyanobacteria.

Nonetheless, the infiltration of hazardous materials from poorly managed dumping sites remains a significant environmental issue in most developing countries such as India. Leachate serves as a prominent point source of contamination in many environmental media like soil, groundwater, and surface water around the world. So the prime issues humans are experiencing are associated with water quality. Thus, the investigation was undertaken to assess the impact of leachate from the Achan landfill on surface water quality in the Temperate Himalayas. Monitoring was done during in all four seasons, viz., spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Among the sites, the leachate outflow site was found to have the highest mean value of pH (7.95), EC (2.16 dS/m), total nitrogen (2.64 mg/l), P (4.75 mg/l), K (1.41 mg/l), Ca (107.45 mg/l), Mg (54.93 mg/l), Zn (0.8 mg/l), Fe (1.78 mg/l), Cu (0.66 mg/l), Mn (0.81 mg/l), BOD (21.47 mg/l), COD (66.24 mg/l), temperature (14.22 degrees C), turbidity (14.29 NTU), while lowest mean values of all parameters were recorded at control site. Among the seasons, summer season was found to have maximum value of pH (7.9), EC (2.36 dS/m), total nitrogen (2.54 mg/l), P (4.0 mg/l), K (0.89 mg/l), Ca (85.94 mg/l), Mg (43.91 mg/l), Fe (1.4 mg/l), Cu (0.52 mg/l), Mn (0.64 mg/l), BOD (22.82 mg/l), COD (65.87 mg/l), temperature (18.99 degrees C), and turbidity (8.49 NTU). The maximum mean value of Zn (0.66 mg/l) was recorded during winter season, while other parameters were found to be minimum during winter season. From this study, we concluded that a decreasing trend was observed during all the seasons in the concentration of all physico-chemical parameters with an increase in distance from the landfill. So it is recommended that the leachate should be treated at the source before disposing into the water body and the landfill should be lined properly to prevent the entry of leachate into water sources.

J	Walker, KF				Walker, K. F.			Reproductive phenology of river and lake populations of freshwater mussels (Unionida: Hyriidae) in the River Murray	MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH												Gonadal cycles are described for Alathyria jacksoni and Velesunio ambiguus from the River Murray at Overland Corner (near Lock 3) and for V. ambiguus at Point Sturt, Lake Alexandrina. The study included periods of low flow (1982), minor flooding (1983) and intermediate flow (1986). In males, gametogenesis continued year-round with fertilisation in late winter. Female A. jacksoni brooded embryos in spring and released glochidia during spring and summer, whereas in female V. ambiguus, glochidia were present most of the year, with peak releases in spring and summer. In both species, the proportions of actively reproducing individuals varied. In the Murray, populations were influenced by variations in discharge. At Point Sturt, gonadal cycles in V. ambiguus were irregular, influenced by variable lake levels. Although both species are essentially gonochoristic, there were hermaphrodites in river and lake populations, and a female bias in the population at Point Sturt. Infections by parasitic trematodes at Point Sturt were rare, but occurred in 10% of A. jacksoni and 35% of V. ambiguus at Overland Corner. The river populations were also affected by gill damage due to unionicolid mites. The disparities in infections between river and lake mussels are unexplained, but did affect their reproductive activity.																			1323-5818	1448-6067					2017	37	1					31	44		10.1080/13235818.2016.1206166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13235818.2016.1206166													WOS:000390416400005

Morphological and histological analysis of samples taken monthly over a period of two years (February 1993 - February 1995) allowed us to follow the annual changes in the gonad tissues, and to ascertain that the species is fertile for most of the year with two peak periods, which occur in July and November, when there is massive gamete release. A short period of non-fertilization takes place in January and February when few spermatozoa occur and no ova are produced. Through the monitoring of the ontogenetic stages of P henslowanum in Lake Piediluco, it was possible to determine the average life span of two distinct generations per year to be 12-14 months for the main one (winter generation) and 14-16 months for the subsidiary one (summer generation). The population is semelparous and bivoltine, with hatchings in late spring and late autumn. Self-fertilization was documented in many specimens, since a large number of free spermatozoa and ova were observed within the female follicles.

To comprehensively evaluate the eco-health status of city river in the mesothermal zone, we used the Yitong River, which is one of the major representative rivers of the cities in northern China, as an example; the monitoring and analysis of water environmental factors, plankton, and heavy metal elements within its watershed were conducted in the autumn and winter of 2022. Based on a single-factor assessment of the health status of the Yitong River, a TOPSIS model was constructed to assess the eco-health status of the river by objectively allocating weights to each indicator. The research showed that most of the sampling sites were rated as "moderate" based on the Water Quality Index (WQI) method. The results of the evaluation on the basis of the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) method showed that the proportion of stations with a rating greater than "moderate," in autumn and winter seasons of the Yitong River, was 50% and 30%, respectively. The Absolute Principal Component Score-Multiple Linear Regression (APCS-MLR) model was used to analyze the physical origins of metals in the river. The results showed that the sources of pollution in the Yitong River in autumn could be divided into natural, industrial, and agricultural sources, while in winter, they were attributed to agriculture, transportation, industry, and atmospheric deposition sources. The assessment of potential risks from heavy metals showed that the results were similar for the evaluation sites in autumn, while the potential risk was more severe in the urban reaches than in the rural reaches in winter. The results of the comprehensive ecological risk health assessment of the Yitong River on the basis of the improved TOPSIS model showed that the health position of the Yitong River was "Low" in autumn and winter, with a decreasing trend from the upstream to the downstream in autumn, and that the urban section of the river was more polluted than the rural section in winter. The results of related analyses proved that heavy metals are the main factor limiting the comprehensive eco-health of the Yitong River. Therefore, controlling the sinking of heavy metals into the Yitong River basin may be an effective way to maintain its eco-health.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL 7	2025	197	8							871	10.1007/s10661-025-14300-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14300-2								40624178					WOS:001524043200001
J	Huntington, TG; Aiken, GR				Huntington, Thomas G.; Aiken, George R.			Export of dissolved organic carbon from the Penobscot River basin in north-central Maine	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux from the Penobscot River and its major tributaries in Maine was determined using continuous discharge measurements, discrete water sampling, and the LOADEST regression software. The average daily flux during 2004-2007 was 71 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (392 Mt C d(-1)), an amount larger than measured in most northern temperate and boreal rivers. Distinct seasonal variation was observed in the relation between concentration and discharge (C-Q). During June through December (summer/fall), there was a relatively steep positive C-Q relation where concentration increased by a factor of 2-3 over the approximately 20-fold range of observed stream discharge for the Penobscot River near Eddington, Maine. In contrast, during January through May (winter/spring), DOC concentration did not increase with increasing discharge. In addition, we observed a major shift in the C-Q between 2004-2005 and 2006-2007, apparently resulting from unprecedented rainfall, runoff, and soil flushing beginning in late fall 2005. The relative contribution to the total Penobscot River basin DOC flux from each tributary varied dramatically by season, reflecting the role of large regulated reservoirs in certain basins. DOC concentration and flux per unit watershed area were highest in tributaries containing the largest areas in palustrine wetlands. Tributary DOC concentration and flux was positively correlated to percentage wetland area. Climatic or environmental changes that influence the magnitude or timing of river discharge or the abundance of wetlands will likely affect the export of DOC to the near-coastal ocean.

Previous laboratory studies indicated that bioturbation by chironomids can reduce CH4 production and increase CH4 oxidation by enhancing oxygen transport into sediment. Thus, reduction in chironomid density by application of biocides for mosquito control, such as Bacillus thuringinesis var. israelensis (Bti), have the potential to affect CH4 emissions. We evaluated the effect of a 41% reduction in chironomid larvae abundance due to Bti applications on CH4 dynamics in the aquatic and aquatic-terrestrial transition zones of 12 floodplain pond mesocosms (FPMs) (half treated, half control). We evaluated short-term (2 months) and seasonal effects by measuring CH4 emissions, dissolved concentrations, and oxidation rates in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. On average, CH4 emissions from the aquatic-terrestrial transition zone of the treated FPMs were 137 % higher than those of the control FPMs. The lack of differences in mean oxidation rates between the treated and control mesocosms suggests that a reduction in bioturbation and the associated decreased oxygen transport into the sediment promoted CH4 production in the treated FPMs. Our findings point to potential effects of Bti on CH4 biogeochemistry through alterations of the chironomid abundance, and highlight the underestimated role of invertebrates in biogeochemical cycling in these ecosystems.					; Lorke, Andreas/B-9195-2008	Ganglo, Caroline/0000-0002-7678-8442; Manfrin, Alessandro/0000-0001-5259-980X; Lorke, Andreas/0000-0001-5533-1817														2624-9375				SEP 12	2022	4								996898	10.3389/frwa.2022.996898	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.996898													WOS:000860462400001
J	Scheffer, M; Rinaldi, S; Kuznetsov, YA; vanNes, EH				Scheffer, M; Rinaldi, S; Kuznetsov, YA; vanNes, EH			Seasonal dynamics of Daphnia and algae explained as a periodically forced predator-prey system	OIKOS												The classical seasonal sequence of events in lake plankton is an early spring bloom of algae followed by a peak of zooplankton, typically of the genus Daphnia, grazing down algal biomass resulting in the spring clear-water phase around early June. Subsequently, Daphnia numbers usually remain low and algal biomass increases until autumn when a second small Daphnia peak can cause another drop in algal biomass. In this paper we show that this entire scenario with the right timing of events comes out naturally from a minimal model of the Daphnia-algae interaction if we simply vary the parameters of the model sinusoidally over the year to mimic the effect of seasonal variation in temperature, light and predation pressure from planktivorous fish. The model also reproduces the observation that in lakes where fish biomass is low, Daphnia peaks can continue to occur regularly throughout the summer, while in lakes with very high fish biomass Daphnia can be virtually absent throughout the season.					van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012; Kuznetsov, Yuri/A-9620-2014	Kuznetsov, Yuri/0000-0003-2289-0801; van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X													0030-1299	1600-0706				DEC	1997	80	3					519	532		10.2307/3546625	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546625													WOS:A1997YL29100012

Wastewater samples were collected from influent after having gone through the fine grille, anaerobic tank, anoxic tank, and aerobics tank, respectively. The final stage yielded effluent. Results confirmed the presence of phosphite in the MWTP ranging from 4.62 +/- 1.00 mu g P L-1 to 34.30 +/- 3.49 mu g P L-1 in influent and from 1.15 +/- 0.5 mu g P L-1 to 4.42 +/- 0.9 mu g P L-1 in effluent. Phosphite accounted for approximately 0.15% to 2.27% of total soluble phosphorus (TSP). During the A2/O-MBR process, the average removal of phosphite was 82.41 +/- 7.45%. The anaerobic biological treatment removed the most phosphite from wastewater in this study. Spatially, phosphite concentrations decreased gradually as the wastewater treatment process progressed. Seasonally, the phosphite concentrations in spring and winter were higher than those in summer and autumn. The phosphite concentration in effluent was of the same order of magnitude as that in nearby natural water, which suggested MWTP effluent may be an important phosphite contributor to the natural water.					; chao, han/JDD-4292-2023; hq, ren/AGA-1128-2022	Ren, Hong-qiang/0000-0001-6136-800X; 													2050-7887	2050-7895					2015	17	2					441	447		10.1039/c4em00543k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4em00543k								25564363					WOS:000349698500018

Numbers of rhizome and stem internodes increased in spring-summer and in late summer-autumn, revealing two successive periods of both horizontal and vertical expansion; leaf density increased continuously until October (78,210 leaves m(-2)). An annual population in a temporary lagoon grew and reproduced from May to August, and died afterwards leaving seeds as the habitat temporarily dried. Numbers of rhizome internodes sharply increased only in August, while numbers of stem internodes increased in June, indicating that a slow horizontal expansion was followed by a fast and brief vertical expansion; subsequently a second intense horizontal expansion occurred; leaf density peaked in August (58,080 leaves m(-2)). Several characteristics increased after mid-spring, attaining similar maximum values in annual and perennial populations. However, the perennial population had larger leaves and higher root biomass, but lower reproductive organ biomass. Rhizome, stem and leaf biomass increased sharply in August (113.2 g dw m(-2)) in the annual population and progressively up to October (167.8 g dw m(-2)) in the perennial population. Using principal component analysis, growth and reproduction were found to be mainly affected by temperature.																			0006-8055	1437-4323					2004	47	5					357	366		10.1515/BOT.2004.052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/BOT.2004.052													WOS:000225468300001
J	FISHER, TR; PEELE, ER; AMMERMAN, JW; HARDING, LW				FISHER, TR; PEELE, ER; AMMERMAN, JW; HARDING, LW			NUTRIENT LIMITATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN CHESAPEAKE BAY	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												This paper presents evidence of a seasonal shift from P to N as the nutrient limiting the accumulation of algal biomass in Chesapeake Bay. Following the winter/spring maximum in freshwater runoff, (1) the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus (DIN/PO4) was greater than the N/P of algal biomass; (2) alkaline phosphatase activity was high; (3) phosphate turnover times were short; (4) ammonium turnover times were long; and (5) growth rates of phytoplankton were stimulated by additions of phosphate but not by additions of ammonium or silicate. During the period of low runoff in summer, all indicators reversed, and N limited algal growth rates. Silicate concentrations also showed evidence of biological depletion in spring, which may have limited diatom abundance. Due to the concordance of all indicators at large and small scales, we argue that phytoplankton growth rates exert primary control over biomass accumulation. We conclude that P and Si limit the accumulation of algal biomass along the major axis of Chesapeake Bay in spring, whereas N limits algal accumulation in summer, similar to the conclusions of D'Elia et al. (1986; Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 43: 397-406) for the Patuxent subestuary. Controlling eutrophication of the Bay and its subestuaries will require basin-specific management practices for both N and P reductions in influent waters. Such management efforts will provide ecosystem tests of nutrient limitation on a scale similar to those successfully conducted in lakes.

Increased effective precipitation supported large pluvial lakes and long-lived spring ecosystems in valleys and basins throughout the western and southwestern U.S., but the source and seasonality of the increased precipitation are debated. Increases in the proportions of C4/(C4+ C3) grasses in the diets of large grazers have been ascribed both to increases in summer precipitation and lower atmospheric CO2 levels. Here we present stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from tooth enamel of late Pleistocene herbivores recovered from paleowetland deposits at Tule Spring Fossil Beds National Monument in the Las Vegas Valley of southern Nevada, as well as modern herbivores from the surrounding area. We use these data to investigate whether winter or summer precipitation was responsible for driving the relatively wet hydroclimate conditions that prevailed in the region during the late Pleistocene. We also evaluate whether late Pleistocene grass C4/(C4+ C3) was higher than today, and potential drivers of any changes.Tooth enamel 818O values for Pleistocene Equus, Bison, and Mammuthus are generally low (average 22.0 +/- 0.7%0, 2 s.e., VSMOW) compared to modern equids (27.8 +/- 1.5%0), and imply lower water 818O values (-16.1 +/- 0.8%0) than modern precipitation (-10.5%0) or in waters present in active springs and wells in the Las Vegas Valley (-12.9%0), an area dominated by winter precipitation. In contrast, tooth enamel of Camelops (a browser) generally yielded higher 818O values (23.9 +/- 1.1%0), possibly suggesting drought tolerance. Mean 813C values for the Pleistocene grazers (-6.6 +/- 0.7%0, 2 s.e., VPDB) are considerably higher than for modern equids (-9.6 +/- 0.4%0) and indicate more consumption of C4 grass (17 +/- 5%) than today (4 +/- 4%). However, calculated C4 grass consumption in the late Pleistocene is strikingly lower than the proportion of C4 grass taxa currently present in the valley (55e60%). 813C values in Camelops tooth enamel (-7.7 +/- 1.0%0) are interpreted as reflecting moderate consumption (14 +/- 8%) of Atriplex (saltbush), a C4 shrub that flourishes in regions with hot, dry summers.Lower water 818O values, lower abundance of C4 grasses, and the inferred presence of Atriplex are all consistent with general circulation models for the late Pleistocene that show enhanced delivery of winter precipitation, sourced from the north Pacific, into the interior western U.S. but do not support alternative models that infer enhanced delivery of summer precipitation, sourced from the tropics. In addition, we hypothesize that dietary competition among the diverse and abundant Pleistocene fauna may have driven the grazers analyzed here to feed preferentially on C4 grasses. Dietary partitioning, especially when combined with decreased pCO2 levels during the late Pleistocene, can explain the relatively high 813C values observed in late Pleistocene grazers in the Las Vegas Valley and elsewhere in the southwestern U.S. without requiring additional summer precipitation.

To investigate factors associated with variation in the prevalence and intensity of this monogenean, fish were sampled periodically over 2 yr in Lake Gutierrez. Prevalence and mean intensity are higher in smaller fishes than in larger ones. A seasonal pattern was observed, with peak recruitment and peak mean intensity occurring in early spring (September), followed by lows in late summer (January-February). Galaxias maculatus length classes are spatially segregated due to seasonal migrations, so the annual infection cycle is characterized by higher prevalence and intensity from late winter to early summer in the smaller fish from the deep zone of the lake.

To investigate these effects on phytoplankton communities in freshwater lakes, phytoplankton and zooplankton were sampled, and physical-chemical variables were measured during spring and summer in two important freshwater lakes in northern China: Nansi Lake and Dongping Lake. The redundancy analysis results showed that phytoplankton density and biomass were regulated by physical-chemical variables (bottom-up effects) and predation (top-down effects) together, and the former was more prominent in both lakes. However, the correlation analysis indicated that the top-down effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton were not significant in spring and summer in both lakes, while the bottom-up regulation of physical-chemical variables on phytoplankton had different patterns in the two lakes. In Nansi Lake, the bottom-up effects of physical-chemical variables on phytoplankton were weaker in summer than that in spring due to the abundant nutrients in summer. In Dongping Lake, the bottom-up effects of physical-chemical on phytoplankton were significant both in spring and summer, and the dominant bottom-up control factor shifted from total nitrogen in spring to total phosphorus in summer, with an increased ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus due to changes in limiting factors. In the two studied lakes, with fish culture, the bottom-up effects of phytoplankton on zooplankton were more important than the top-down effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton. These results demonstrate the interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton and highlight the importance of phytoplankton regulation in freshwater lakes, which has implications for the effective management of freshwater lake ecosystems.

Mustard Cover Crops for Biomass Production and Weed Suppression in the Great Lakes Region	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Short-season cover cropping can be an important weed management tool. To optimize the use of mustard [Sinapis alba L. and Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.] in the Great Lakes region, we assessed planting time effects, mustard biomass production, and weed suppression during mustard growth and aft er incorporation. The study was conducted in Illinois, Michigan, and New York for spring and fall from 2010 to 2012. Mustard was sown every similar to 10 d from mid-March to early June for spring plantings and from early August to mid-September for fall plantings. Spring mustard biomass, weed density, community composition, and dry biomass were collected at mustard flowering. Fall mustard biomass, weed density, and dry biomass were collected at season end. Spring mustard biomass ranged from <0.5 to 4 t ha(-1). Early fall biomass ranged from 3 to 5.5 t ha(-1), and was related to growing degree days (GDD) according to a logistic function. Weed biomass during mustard growth was reduced by at least 50% in 9 of 10 site-years (90%) for fall-planted mustard but only 15 of 31 site-years (48%) in spring plantings. Weed suppression was independent of mustard biomass. The total number of weed seedlings emerging aft er mustard incorporation was not significantly reduced, but there was a species-specific response, with a decrease in common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and grass emergence. The results permit a location-specific recommendation to plant mustard cover crops 13 to 23 August in the southern Great Lakes Region, and no later than 1 to 10 September for adequate biomass production.

Phosphorus and nitrogen deposition within a large transboundary watershed: Implications for nutrient stoichiometry and lake vs watershed budgets	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Atmospheric deposition is an important source of both phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) to lakes and their watersheds, but the two nutrients are rarely reported together. For the first time, we measured total P (TP) and N (total, ammonium, NH4-N and nitrate, NO3-N) bulk deposition to the Lake of the Woods (LoW) watershed, a large international lake that experiences frequent, lake-wide cyanobacterial blooms. Phosphorus deposition was highly variable both spatially and seasonally, with on average >75 % of annual deposition occurring in the spring and summer months, associated with local biogenic input. In contrast, winter TP deposition was relatively low and spatially invariant, and not affected by local sources. Importantly, these results suggest that P deposition may be a much larger source of input to the LoW as a result of its tortuous shoreline and abundance of forested islands (>5000), which are concentrated in the northern, Canadian waters and greatly extend the 'shoreline influence' within this lake. We suggest that a single annual TP load estimate is not appropriate for the LoW because winter deposition is likely much lower than past estimates whereas spring/summer deposition is substantially higher and could be an important, but previously unrecognized source, of bioavailable P to the nearshore waters. Further research is needed on the spatial and temporal patterns of P vs N deposition to the lake surface and their influence on primary productivity and algal species composition.& COPY; 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Our purpose was to: (i) investigate the transport dynamics of inorganic N in Sierra Nevada soils by applying unspiked source water as a control, and a 1 mmol(c) L-1 NH4NO3 spiked solution to two soil types (granitic and andesitic) under forest and meadow conditions via artificial rainfall during moist (spring) and dry (late summer-early fall) seasons; and (ii) evaluate the presence of macropore or preferential matrix flow from characteristic profile distributions of the two N forms. Peak concentrations in surface flow discharge (runoff) of both N forms from control treatments occurred early for both soil types and were highest from the meadow areas (1.6-0.4 mg NO3--N L-1 meadow to forest for granitic soil and 0.3-0.1 mg L-1 meadow to forest for andesitic soil; 0.75-0.37 mg NH4+-N L-1 meadow to forest for granitic soil and 0.25-0.18 mg L-1 meadow to forest for andesitic soil). Both soils exhibited NH4+-N adsorption, but only the soil of andesitic origin appeared to sorb NO3--N. Andesitic soils of the Sierra Nevada may thus serve as a temporary sink for NO3--N deposition, whereas meadow areas of both soil types appear to serve as a source. Higher initial soil moisture for the spiked treatments generally resulted in the transport of MH4+-N to greater depths in both soils of forested cover (approximate to 40 compared with 20 cm from spring to late summer-early fall), and for NO3--N (approximate to 50 compared with 40 cm) as well. Wet-season (spring) mobility must therefore be considered an important groundwater nutrient transport mechanism in Sierra Nevada watershed soils.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				NOV-DEC	1997	61	6					1774	1780		10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100060032x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100060032x													WOS:A1997YK30100032

The first generation develops during spring when food levels are high and temperatures are low and warming slowly. The second generation develops during summer at low food levels and higher initial temperatures which continue to warm. In three experimental treatments, the development, growth and survival of first- and second-generation Artemia were determined under laboratory conditions which tracked the natural temperature and food regimes in the lake. Two food treatments were administered concurrently at low temperatures to first-generation shrimp,representing the high levels usually found during the spring (spring-high-food) and reduced food levels observed during a recent 6 year period of meromixis (spring-low-food). The third treatment of low food and higher temperatures was administered to second-generation shrimp in summer (summer-low-food). The development to adulthood and onset of reproduction occurred 5 days sooner in the high-food treatment than in the low-food treatment of the spring experiment, while development was 2-3 times faster in the warmer, summer-low-food treatment. Under spring-high-food conditions, shrimp had a higher survival to adulthood (46%) and lower daily mortality rate (0.012 day(-1)) than in the spring-low food treatment (30% survival and a 0.015 day(-1) mortality rate). Survival to adulthood of summer-low food animals (49%) was similar to that in spring-high-food; however, the daily mortality rate was twice as high (0.029 day(-1)). While instar-specific length did not vary among treatments, instar-specific weights of juveniles and adults were lower in the summer-low-food treatment than in the other two treatments. Since food in the summer-low food treatment was lower and temperatures higher than in the spring-low-food treatment, the lower weights in summer may be explained by food rather than temperature, or by both. The cumulative secondary production of single cohorts was lowest in the summer(0.32 mg dry weight individual(-1)) due to low individual weights and highest under spring-high-food conditions (1.1 mg dry weight individual(-1)).

The monthly, seasonal, and spatial changes in physicochemical parameters and heavy metals were determined using water quality index (WQI), hierarchical cluster analysis, principal components analysis (PCA), and other statistical methods revealing the water quality characteristics and pollutants. WQI was calculated using parameters constituting the main components of water. It was determined that, according to WHO and SWQR, the water quality of this river varied between high quality and very polluted. The sodium absorption rate, % Na, residual sodium carbonate, and Kelly Ratio results did not exceed the threshold but the water was found to be dangerous in terms of magnesium hazard. In cluster analysis, winter and spring were found to be similar to each other more than autumn and summer. Moreover, with this analysis, the basin was spatially divided into an upper basin and a lower basin. Five main factors were found to be significantly affected by parameters explaining 84.65% of the total variance in PCA. It was found that temperature, anions originating from pesticides and fertilizers, and non-point pollutants originating from heavy metals were the pollution sources of this river. Monitoring is recommended in freshwater management of basins for the future of wildlife.

The pollen sequences shows that tree vegetation was minor around 18,000 yr B.P. The landscape was dominated by chenopod low shrublands and ephemeral (Tubuliflorae) vegetation. By approximately 17,000 yr B.P., Callitris moved in and rose to 25% of the pollen sum. Values of Casuarina, myrtaceous shrubs, Acacia, Dodonaea and Cyperaceae also rose at about the same time. Between approximately 17,000 and approximately 14,500 yr B.P., Callitris and Eucalyptus dominated the tree vegetation with Callitris reaching its maximum values. Eucalypt woodlands were associated with under-shrubs belonging to Myrtaceae, Acacia, Dodonaea and Gyrostemonaceae, whereas Callitris woodlands had probably supported only a sparse understorey. Chenopodiaceae, today distributed mainly in the winter rainfall zone, continued to show high values (> 25%). Gramineae, today associated with high summer rainfall, generally remained below 20%. The sporadic presence of a number of taxa, which now grow in temperature areas further south, suggest that average annual temperatures were a little lower than at present. From approximately 14,500 to approximately 13,000 yr B.P. there was a sudden decline in the values of Callitris and a more gradual decline in Chenopodiaceae and Dodonaea. The rise of ephemeral vegetation together with a fall in Chenopodiaceae would indicate that winter precipitation had started to decline. Between approximately 13,000 and approximately 4500 yr B.P., Chenopodiaceae and Tubuliflorae (ephemerals) declined, and Gramineae rose to its highest values. Tribulus pollen, a subtropical/tropical taxon, first appeared approximately 13,000 yr B.P. Overall, plants from the summer rainfall zone became more prominent, and taxa from the temperate south declined. Summer monsoon incursions apparently strengthened, and temperature increased during this phase. Since approximately 4500 yr B.P. both Chenopodiaceae and Tubuliflorae returned to high values whereas Gramineae declined. Values of Acacia and myrtaceous shrubs rose but those of Casuarina declined and Callitris remained extremely low. These changes were accompanied by the onset of playa environments, which have since persisted. Vegetation during this phase suggests that summer precipitation declined and summer monsoon incursions became rare during the late Holocene.

The cladocerans, Bosmina meridionalis and Ceriodaphnia dubia, had unimodal patterns of abundance with peak densities in summer; cyclopoids had a single peak of maximum abundance in autumn and Daphnia carinata showed a bimodal pattern with peak densities in early summer and early winter. The strong seasonality in abundance of zooplankton in Lake Mahinerangi distinguishes this lake from other temperate lakes in New Zealand and may reflect its cool winter temperatures (< 5-degrees-C for 2 months). A calanoid, Boeckella hamata, bred throughout the year and was the dominant species numerically. Instar analysis indicated that there were at least three, and possibly four, generations per year. Instantaneous birth and death rates were low with annual mean values (0.036 and 0.057, respectively) that were 2-3.5 times less than those recorded in a population of the same species in Lake Pounui, but within the range of those recorded in calanoid populations elsewhere in New Zealand. The Boeckella population in Lake Mahinerangi appears to be controlled largely by temperature, parasitism and food, with predation having no, or a negligible, effect.																			0020-9309						1992	77	4					553	577		10.1002/iroh.19920770403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19920770403													WOS:A1992KF31500002

In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, Indigenous communities have experienced harvest declines of wild rice (Ojibwemowin: Manoomin; Dakodiapi: Psin; Latin: Zizania palustris), a sacred aquatic plant central to their culture. Here we analyzed 1985-2020 wild rice density and harvest data in relation to key climate variables. Our results indicate that wild rice stem density in the fall is higher in years that have (1) lower early-summer water levels due to decreased precipitation, and (2) longer lake-ice duration due to colder winter temperatures. Overall, wild rice available for tribal harvest off-reservation has declined regionally by similar to 5-7% annually-declines that are likely to continue due to anthropogenic climate change, specifically increased early-summer precipitation and warmer winters. This decline has infringed on Indigenous lifeways by reducing off-reservation tribal harvest, a right guaranteed by treaties with the U.S. government.

Site chronologies were built with 37 trees for ring width and four trees for carbon isotope composition, respectively. Correlation analysis with monthly climatic data revealed that radial growth of the trees is related to temperature in early spring, precipitation (or number of precipitation days) in early summer and precipitation in previous-year summer to autumn. Tree-ring cellulose carbon isotopic composition is correlated most significantly with the number of precipitation days in early summer months. Consequently, a chronology of the number of precipitation days in May was reconstructed by multiple regression analysis with ring-width and carbon-isotope predictors and was validated by comparison with the recent observed record.

Microbial Engineering of Floc Fe and Trace Element Geochemistry in a Circumneutral, Remote Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Evaluation of lacustrine floc Fe, Pb, and Cd biogeochemistry over seasonal (summer, winter) and water column depth (metalimnetic, hypolimnetic) scales reveals depth-independent seasonally significant differences in floc Fe biominerals and trace element (TE: Pb, Cd) sequestration, driven by floc microbial community shifts. Winter floc [TE] were significantly lower than summer [TE], driven by declining abundance and reactivity of floc amorphous Fe-(III)-(oxy)hydroxide (FeOOH) phases under ice ([FeOOH](summer) = 37-77 mgg(-1) vs [FeOOH](winter) = 0.3-7 mgg(-1)). Further, while high summer floc [FeOOH] was observed at both water column depths, winter floc was dominated by Fe-(II) phases. However, the observed seasonal change in the nature and concentrations of floc Fe-phases was independent of water column [Fe], O-2, and pH and, instead, significantly correlated to floc bacterial community membership. Bioinformatic modeling (Unifrac, PCA analyses) of in situ and experimental microcosm results identified a temperature-driven seasonal turnover of floc microbial communities, shifting from dominantly putative Fe metabolisms within summer floc to wintertime ancillary Fe reducing and S metabolizing bacteria. This seasonal shift of floc microbial community functioning, significantly the wintertime loss of microbial Fe-(II)-oxidizing capability and concomitant increases of sulfur-reducing bacteria, alters dominant floc Fe minerals from Fe-(III) to Fe-(II) phases. This resulted in decreased winter floc [TE], not predicted by water column geochemistry.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 17	2014	48	12					6578	6587		10.1021/es403754t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es403754t								24810706					WOS:000337646000008

The seasonal-scale varved data indicate that the winter severity and duration of summer growing season has changed considerably during the Holocene in southern central Finland. Periods of increased catchment erosion occurred at 7590-7530 BC, 7450-7400 BC, 7220-7110 BC, 7000-6000 BC, 5400-5200 BC, 4400-4000 BC, 2700-2400 BC, ca. 1500 BC to AD 500, and 1400 AD onwards. The observed changes are likely related to severe winters conditions with high net accumulation of snow between ca. 7500 BC and AD 300, whereas AD 300 onwards an increasing agricultural input is seen in the varve and pollen data. Periods that can be interpreted as indicating attenuated spring floods caused by milder and wetter winters appeared around 7000 BC and AD 1000-AD 1200, the latter corresponding with the last historically recorded warm interval in Europe, known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly.

Seasonal variations on total fatty acid composition of fillets of zander (Sander lucioperca) in Beysehir Lake (Turkey)	FOOD CHEMISTRY												Seasonal variations on total fatty acid compositions of zander, Sander lucioperca in Beysehir Lake, were determined by using GC. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were found to be higher than saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in all seasons. Palmitic acid was the major SFA (57.0-64.0% of total SFA) in all seasons. Oleic acid was identified as the major MUFA (45.0-58.0% of total MUFAs). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), linoleic acid (LA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and arachidonic acid (AA) were the most abundant PUFA. Relating to the total fatty acid composition of zander, the percentages of DHA, LA, AA, and EPA ranged between 17.1-23.3%, 5.40-15.4%, 6.72-9.94% and 4.22-5.93% of total lipid, respectively. The percentages of total omega 3 fatty acid were higher than those of total omega 6 fatty acid in the fatty acid composition of zander with omega 3/omega 6 ratios of 1.49, 1.45, 1.22, 0.72 in spring, autumn, winter, and summer, respectively. It was shown that the fatty acid composition and omega 3/omega 6 fatty acids ratio in the muscle of zander were significantly influenced by spawning and season. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, H; Somogyi, B; Tóth, V				Li, Huan; Somogyi, Boglarka; Toth, Viktor			Exploring spatiotemporal features of surface water temperature for Lake Balaton in the 21st century based on Google Earth Engine	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water temperature is a key parameter that needs to be closely monitored since it has a great impact on the physical, chemical, and biological effects on water bodies. As the largest lake in Central Europe, Lake Balaton provides important recreational and ecological values that the water temperature of which could be affected by global warming and anthropogenic activities, which lacks comprehensive investigation. Our study leverages multisource data on Google Earth Engine (GEE) to conduct a temperature variation analysis over two decades and detailed spatial variations across different parts of the lake, with in-situ data serving as both auxiliary and validation source. With an accuracy of 1.6 degrees C and a seasonal quantile difference within 1 degrees C, the satellite-based observations are in good agreement with the in-situ measurements. In the inter-annual analysis, water temperature increases at 0.7 degrees C/decade with more notable warming in annual minimum and winter temperatures, particularly in the shallowest basin. For intra-annual temperature analysis, examining monthly cumulative temperature anomalies indicates that during warming months, the western and shallower regions demonstrate relatively higher temperatures, with a 0.62 degrees C and 0.35 degrees C increase per 1 m decrease in water depth for spring and summer, respectively. Conversely, in cooling months, the deeper, eastern areas exhibit elevated temperatures, with an increase of 0.05 degrees C and 0.11 degrees C per 1 m increase in water depth for autumn and winter, respectively. Surface water temperatures near the coast are predominantly influenced by factors such as wind speed and water depth, inducing cooling effects, while artificial surfaces contribute to warming effects. These discoveries deepened our understanding of the detailed temporal variations and spatial heterogeneity of water temperature in aquatic ecological environment of Lake Balaton, providing valuable insights for effective monitoring and management strategies amid climate change and human activities.

J	Persoiu, A; Ionita, M; Weiss, H				Persoiu, Aurel; Ionita, Monica; Weiss, Harvey			Atmospheric blocking induced by the strengthened Siberian High led to drying in west Asia during the 4.2 kaBP event - a hypothesis	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Causal explanations for the 4.2 ka BP event are based on the amalgamation of seasonal and annual records of climate variability that was manifest across global regions dominated by different climatic regimes. However, instrumental and paleoclimate data indicate that seasonal climate variability is not always sequential in some regions. The present study investigates the spatial manifestation of the 4.2 ka BP event during the boreal winter season in Eurasia, where climate variability is a function of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the westerly winds. We present a multi-proxy reconstruction of winter climate conditions in Europe, west Asia, and northern Africa between 4.3 and 3.8 ka. Our results show that, while winter temperatures were cold throughout the region, precipitation amounts had a heterogeneous distribution, with regionally significant low values in W Asia, SE Europe, and N Europe and local high values in the N Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathian Mountains, and E and NE Europe. Further, strong northerly winds were dominating in the Middle East and E and NE Europe. Analyzing the relationships between these climatic conditions, we hypothesize that in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere, the 4.2 ka BP event was caused by the strengthening and expansion of the Siberian High, which effectively blocked the moisture-carrying westerlies from reaching W Asia and enhanced outbreaks of cold and dry winds in that region. The behavior of the winter and summer monsoons suggests that when parts of Asia and Europe were experiencing winter droughts, SE Asia was experiencing similar summer droughts, resulting from failed and/or reduced monsoons. Thus, while in the extratropical regions of Eurasia the 4.2 ka BP event was a century-scale winter phenomenon, in the monsoon-dominated regions it may have been a feature of summer climate conditions.					; Persoiu, Aurel/F-2029-2010; Ionita, Monica/AAX-3171-2020	Ionita, Monica/0000-0001-8240-4380; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				APR 11	2019	15	2					781	793		10.5194/cp-15-781-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-781-2019													WOS:000464163900001

During this time, climatic conditions at the site ranged from near the driest to near the wettest of he century. Water levels in wetlands and in water-table wells throughout the study area responded to these changing climate conditions in a variety of ways. The topographically highest wetlands recharged ground water whenever they received water from precipitation. The wetland of principal interest, Wetland P1, which is at an intermediate altitude, received ground-water discharge much of the time, but it also had transpiration-induced seepage from it along parts of its perimeter during all bur the wettest year. The large;fluctuations of the water table in response to recharge and transpiration reflect the ease with which water moves vertically through the fractured till. Lateral movement of ground water is much slower; pore-water velocities are generally less than 3 m yr(-1). The water supply to the wetlands is largely from precipitation during fall, winter, and spring. During these periods, precipitation either falls directly on the wetland, or precipitation that falls on the upland runs over frozen soils or saturated soils into the wetland. The average ratio of stage rise to total overwinter precipitation was 2.59 for the 12-year study period. After plants leaf out, precipitation generally results in much lower rises of the wetland water level. The average ratio of stage rise to over-summer precipitation was less than 1.0.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; 													0277-5212					SEP	1995	15	3					193	211		10.1007/BF03160700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160700													WOS:A1995RX93800001

The Great Lakes dampen the variability in near-surface air temperature across the surrounding region while reducing the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and annual cycle of air temperature. The impacts of the Great Lakes on the regional surface energy budget include an increase (decrease) in turbulent fluxes during the cold (warm) season and an increase in surface downward shortwave radiation flux during summer due to diminished atmospheric moisture and convective cloud amount. Changes in the hydrologic budget due to the presence of the Great Lakes include increases in evaporation and precipitation during October-March and decreases during May-August, along with springtime reductions in snowmelt-related runoff. Circulation responses consist of a regionwide decrease in sea level pressure in autumn-winter and an increase in summer, with enhanced ascent and descent in the two seasons, respectively. The most pronounced simulated impact of the Great Lakes on synoptic systems traversing the basin is a weakening of cold-season anticyclones.

J	Li, LL; Xue, B				Li, Lingling; Xue, Bin			Spatial-temporal variability of methane fluxes in lakes varying in latitude, area, and depth	HELIYON												Many previous studies have found spatial and seasonal variabilities in CH4 fluxes, which could significantly affect lake-wide CH4 budgets. However, the ways in which the spatial and seasonal patterns of CH4 fluxes vary among lakes on a global scale is largely unknown. We compiled literature on CH4 flux data from global lakes and analyzed the spatial and seasonal variabilities for lakes varying in latitude, maximum depth, and area. Spatially, we found a significant linear relationship between the ratio of littoral to profundal fluxes and lake morphology (more related to area than depth), while globally, half of the lakes would have within 5% error of CH4 emission estimation under single-zone sampling. Seasonally, mid-latitude lakes showed higher CH4 fluxes in the summer and autumn, indicating the influence of temperature and autumn overturn, and the latter being largely related to maximum depth. Globally, due to abundant shallow lakes in the mid-latitude zone, approximately 99% of lakes had higher fluxes in the summer, while 75% of lakes showed errors in CH4 emission estimation within 20% when only the summer flux was investigated. In the high-latitude lakes, CH4 evasion during the spring ice-off period was signif-icantly correlated with lake maximum depth, while lake area was also important when analyzing the CH4 diffusive flux. Our study yields preliminary conclusions about spatial and seasonal pat-terns of CH4 flux in different lake types, which are fundamental to building an effective sampling strategy and to determining an accurate CH4 budget from global lakes.																				2405-8440				AUG	2023	9	8							e18411	10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e18411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e18411		JUL 2023						37554827					WOS:001055717400001

Therefore consumption rates and prey selectivity of C. flavicans were determined in mesotrophic Lake Grosser Vatersee, where cladocerans were the dominant zooplankton prey and the predatory impact of fish towards C. flavicans and cladocerans was low. Two generations of the main predatory instar IV of C. flavicans appeared in the pelagial, the first in autumn and the second in spring after having over wintered in the sediment. In discrepancy to the abundances, only the autumn generation showed high peaks of consumption. C. flavicans fed preferentially on medium-sized cladocerans, but mostly disregarded daphniids and rotifers. Copepods were only selected when cladocerans were not present. The highest losses due to Chaoborus predation were found in Bosmina longirostris, Bosmina coregoni and Chydorus sphaericus.

When applied to volcanic ashes, it may also provide information on the season and ecological effects of ashfall. Application of the method to volcanic ashes from Lost Trail Pass, Bitterroot Mountains, Montana USA has illustrated that 2 falls of Glacier Peak ash, which occurred about 11,250 14C years ago, were separated by 10 to 25 yr. Volcanic ash from a major eruption of Mount Mazama (about 6700 14C years ago) 1st fell in the autumn and 4.6 cm of ash was deposited before the following spring. There is a reasonable probabilty that about 1 cm of ash fell during the following year and about 1.7 cm fell the year after. In all, the sporadic primary Mazama ashfall lasted for nearly 3 yr. Mazama ash resulted in low lake productivity, as measured by the occurrence of Botryococcus and Pediastrum. Mazama ash, perhaps through a mulching effect, may have produced increased vigor and pollen production in some sagebrush steppe genera. As measured by the records of fossil pollen and acid-resistant algae, effects on the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems were short-lived. With refinement of the methods and broader geographic application, pollen influx studies may prove valuable for separating the regional and chronological details of tephra attributed to Mazama, Glacier Peak and other Cascade Range volcanoes.																			0036-8075	1095-9203					1977	198	4314					257	261		10.1126/science.198.4314.257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.198.4314.257								17770486					WOS:A1977DX12100007

The purpose of the study was to gain detailed information about phytoplankton changes including those of picophytoplankton, to relate these changes to stratification patterns and nutrient chemistry of the lake and to compare them to results from other lakes of similar character. During 1994-1995, a total of 142 phytoplankton taxa was encountered in quantitative samples, most being common in deep, oligotrophic lakes. Seasonal development of phytoplankton is characterized by a definite spring peak followed by a moderate summer peak. Autotrophic picophytoplankton made the largest contribution to the annual total biomass. This is probably true for other, temperate, non-acidic, oligotrophic lakes. Development of the spring assemblage (autotrophic picophytoplankton and centric diatoms) starts in February-March and is terminated by the onset of stratification when diatoms sink to the hypolimnion. Picophytoplankton, especially Synechococcus sp., assembles in a narrow deep-layer maximum in the upper hypolimnion. Our data show that neither deep circulations nor decreased incident radiation under winter ice and snow cover prevent the development of some specially adapted low-light - high-nutrient species. Our views about the length of vegetation period for phytoplankton need to be revised with respect to winter and isothermal conditions.

The study was conducted during at a two-year period, including both summer and autumn cutting seasons in 2016 and 2017. The investigation revealed a significant increase in yields during the summer harvest season. Carvone emerged as the predominant compound, with the exception of the Pinedo cultivar. Carvone contents of the genotypic variations were from 28.0% to 51.0%, exhibiting heightened concentrations during the initial harvest, followed by a subsequent reduction during the autumn harvest season. The major components of the Pinedo was piperitenone oxide, accounting for 67.0% of the oil, and underwent a decline during the autumn harvest.					; DEVRIM, Selma/OBO-2792-2025; TELCİ, İsa/AAI-6920-2021	Telci, Isa/0000-0002-3651-1641; 													1301-1111						2023	28	2					323	332		10.17557/tjfc.1371206	http://dx.doi.org/10.17557/tjfc.1371206													WOS:001130431600001

The maximum in May was preceded by rapid growth as indicated by increased values of primary productivity and pigment concentration. As the spring bloom progressed, decreasing nutrient levels apparently slowed diatom growth. The diatom-biomass accumulation rate declined, assimilation quotients were minimal and soluble reactive Si was reduced from 13 to 6.8 .mu.mol/l. In summer, after the bloom, diatom biomass and Si reached seasonal minima of < 250 mg C/m2 and .apprx. 1.0 .mu.mol/l, respectively. Diatom biomass increased again in October when Si supplies were replenished and the concentration exceeded 6.6 .mu.mol/l. A critical Si concentration of .apprx. 6.5 .mu.mol/l may control the development and timing of offshore diatom populations in Lake Michigan.																									1977	34	4					552	558		10.1139/f77-087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-087													WOS:A1977DA61200012

We studied the distribution of arsenic (As) species in the water column of Mono Lake between February and November, 2002. This period captured the seasonal progression from winter mixing, through summer thermal stratification, to autumn overturn. Arsenic speciation was determined by ion chromatography-inductively coupled-plasma-mass spectrometry of samples preserved in the field by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. We found that arsenic speciation was dominated (> 90%) by arsenate when oxygen was detectable. Once levels fell below 6 mu mol/L O-2, arsenic speciation shifted to dominance by reduced species. Arsenate and arsenite co-occurred in a transition zone immediately below the base of the oxycline and low but significant concentrations of arsenate were occasionally detected in sulfidic hypolimnion samples. Thio-arsenic species were the dominant form of As found in sulfidic waters. Maxima of thio-arsenic species with stoichiometries consistent with mono-, di- and trithio-arsenic occurred in succession as sulfide concentration increased. A compound with a stoichiometry consistent with trithio-arsenic was the dominant As species (similar to 50% of total As) in high sulfide (2 mmol/L) bottom water. Lower concentrations of total As in bottom water relative to surface water suggest precipitation of As/S mineral phases in response to sulfide accumulation during prolonged anoxia.

However, this understanding partly relies on the compilation of existing proxy records, the majority of which carry a warm season bias such that there is an underrepresentation of cold-season temperatures. Here we report a unique cold-season temperature record based on the alkenone paleothermometer from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau that spans the last two millennia. In contrast to the regional- and hemisphere-scale summer cooling, our reconstruction shows a long-term warming through the Medieval Climate Anomaly into Little Ice Age. We attribute these opposing temperature trends to combined effects of seasonally divergent insolation and North Atlantic subpolar gyre circulation. Our study indicates that the cold season during the Little Ice Age was not the coldest period of the last two millennia at least on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Cold seasons became warmer on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the Little Ice Age while summer temperatures cooled, according to an alkenone-based winter-spring temperature reconstruction from freshwater Lake Ngoring.					; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; Li, Xiang-zhong/B-1576-2009; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017; Li, Han/MEO-0927-2025; Cai, Yanjun/A-9462-2010	Yao, Yuan/0000-0002-9833-5639; Zhao, Jingyao/0000-0002-4252-6540; li, xiang zhong/0000-0003-3491-8824; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; 														2662-4435				MAY 26	2023	4	1							182	10.1038/s43247-023-00855-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00855-w													WOS:000995933100002

DO was measured above and below shallow subtidal rocks, in the Rapids connection to the Celtic Sea, in seagrass meadows (Zostera marina), and at various water depths (1-15 m) in the South Basin. DO values above rocks were normoxic to hyperoxic in daytime (7.8-17.3 mg l(-1)); below rocks were often hypoxic (0.24-2 mg l(-1)). South Basin sites experienced hypoxia less often than the North Basin, except for the Goleen, presumably due to differential current flow. DO fluctuations occurred in spring (before ephemeral macroalgae proliferate), summer (when algal mats smother the benthos), and autumn (when macroalgae decay). While the Rapids were normoxic, the seagrass meadows below them exhibited periodic DO stress. Labhra Cliff (9-14.5 m) was normoxic to hyperoxic in autumn but experienced suboxic and hypoxic events in summer. Many organisms in Lough Hyne are experiencing periods of hypoxia below their published sublethal limits, the effects of which could be exacerbated by periodic hyperoxia.

Two spawning periods occurred during 1975, late April until late July resulting in a spring generation; and late Aug. through early Dec. leading to a fall generation. Mean reproductive output was 387.0 veligers/clam per day (S.D. = .+-. 129.0) for the spring spawning period and 319.8 veligers/clam per day (S.D. = .+-. 222.3) for the fall spawning period for a total spring release of 388,495 veligers m-2 and fall release of 752,325 veligers m-2. Spawning was initiated at 19.degree. C and inhibited at summer temperatures above 32.degree. C. Maximum veliger release occurred at 25.7.degree. C. C. manilensis reached sexual maturity at a shell length of 10 mm. The life span was approximately 14-17 mo., while some individuals survived for up to 24 mo. Annual average shell length was approximately 35 mm. A peak density of 94.6 clams m-2 occurred in Dec. 1975, and a low density of 17.7 clams m-2 during June, 1975. Annual accumulation of shell calcium carbonate was approximately 317 g CaCO3 m-2 year-1, the equivalent of 10 g CaCO3/clam per year. Average standing crop organic C biomass values over the life span of the spring and fall generations were 1.1 g C m-2 and 0.9 g C m-2, respectively, and that of the entire population, 2.6 g C m-2. Total annual assimilation of the C. manilensis population was 14.6 g C m-2 year-1 of which 29% was utilized in respiration leaving the remaining 71% as annual net productivity (nonrespired assimilation) (10.4 g C m-2 year-1). Reproduction accounted for 15.3% of the annual net productivity leaving 84.7% for growth. Turnover ratios (net productivity to average standing crop in C/m ratios) were 4.8 (spring generation) and 5.5 (fall generation), equivalent to turnover times of 91 and 95 days, respectively. Annual turnover ratio for the whole population was 4.1 or a turnover time of 91 days.																			0260-1230	1464-3766					1978	44	APR					49	70																WOS:A1978FB99800002

The main routes of P transfer between the lake water and the sediment are settlement of abiotic particles and planktonic diatoms, summer sediment release and re-sedimentation in the last months of the year. The annual river loading to the lake varied between 0.7 and 1.8 g P m(-2), and sediment release can be as much as 1.4 g P m(-2). A simple model evaluated the effect of sediment-water exchanges on the phosphorus available for spring phytoplankton growth. It showed that re-sedimentation of released P and washout over the winter greatly mitigated its effect. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the very large summer releases of sediment P were not related directly to the spring inputs from diatom settlement. No long-term trends in P release were seen.

Perspectives in winter limnology: closing the annual cycle of freezing lakes	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					1st International Winter Limnology Symposium	MAY 24-28, 2008	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLAND	Univ Jyvaskyla, Univ Joensuu, Univ Helsinki	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn			Winter has traditionally been considered as an ecologically insignificant season and, together with technical difficulties, this has led winter limnology to lag behind summer limnology. Recently, rapidly expanding interest in climate warming has increased water research in winter. It has also become clear that neither winter conditions of lakes nor under-ice communities are as static as often supposed. Although interannual differences in water temperature are small, close to the maximum density temperature, they may have profound effect on under-ice hydrodynamics. Thus, stochastic variations in weather, particularly those preceding the time of freezing and ice melting, may have important consequences for hydrodynamics which then affect the distributions and conditions of microorganisms and probably further to higher trophic levels. Even fish distributions can be dictated by under-ice conditions and their activities as well as behavior can sometimes approach those in summer. Life in freshwater ice is one of the least studied aspects of winter limnology and recent studies suggest that a thorough evaluation is needed. Altogether there are strengthening signs that winter should be considered as an integral part in the functioning and dynamics of lakes affecting quantitative and qualitative characteristics of aquatic communities in summer. There are great prospects that more thorough understanding of the prevailing limnological conditions in winter will improve our understanding of lake ecosystems in their entirety, and there is no doubt that such an approach requires multidisciplinary and long- term studies at different spatial scales.

Influence of Local and Landscape Characteristics on Avian Richness and Density in Wet Playas of the Southern Great Plains, USA	WETLANDS												Playa wetlands (shallow, circular, depressional wetlands) in the Southern Great Plains are essential to the maintenance of regional biodiversity. However, the relative importance of habitat characteristics for maintaining avian species richness and density in playas is unknown. We examined influences of local- and landscape-scale characteristics on avian communities in wet playas. We conducted biweekly avian surveys on 80 playas (40 playas/year) from summer 2003 through spring 2005. Avian species richness was positively related to playa area and hydroperiod. More avian species and greater densities of birds were found at wetlands when water depths were intermediate (30-80 cm) during fall, winter and spring. Increased cultivation in playa watersheds increased total-, native-, and exotic-avian species richness. However, unsustainable sediment accumulation caused by cultivation can fill the playa basin and result in the loss of playa function, which will not benefit future bird populations. Landscape variables generally were less consistent with avian communities among seasons compared to local variables. Playas with greater numbers of other playas within 1 and 10 km had lower bird densities than those with fewer surrounding playas, likely due to the increase of habitat availability. Larger playas within predominantly uncultivated watersheds, that have an intermediate water depth, longer hydroperiod (within a season), and 26-50% vegetation cover are likely to maximize seasonal native avian richness. However, manipulating static water depths and maintaining long hydroperiods over extended periods will not meet avian objectives over the long term because playas must go through natural wet/dry fluctuations between years to maintain the desired plant community and productivity that supports diverse avian populations.

J	Jabbar, FK; Grote, K				Jabbar, Fadhil K.; Grote, Katherine			Statistical assessment of nonpoint source pollution in agricultural watersheds in the Lower Grand River watershed, MO, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The water quality in many Midwestern streams and lakes is negatively impacted by agricultural activities. Although the agricultural inputs that degrade water quality are well known, the impact of these inputs varies as a function of geologic and topographic parameters. To better understand how a range of land use, geologic, and topographic factors affect water quality in Midwestern watersheds, we sampled surface water quality parameters, including nitrate, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, bacteria, pH, specific conductance, temperature, and biotic index (BI) in 35 independent sub-watersheds within the Lower Grand River Watershed in northern Missouri. For each sub-watershed, the land use/land cover, soil texture, depth to bedrock, depth to the water table, recent precipitation area, total stream length, watershed shape/relief ratio, topographic complexity, mean elevation, and slope were determined. Water quality sampling was conducted twice: in the spring and in the late summer/early fall. A pairwise comparison of water quality parameters acquired in the fall and spring showed that each of these factors varies considerably with season, suggesting that the timing is critical when comparing water quality indicators. Correlation analysis between water quality indicators and watershed characteristics revealed that both geologic and land use characteristics correlated significantly with water quality parameters. The water quality index had the highest correlation with the biotic index during the spring, implying that the lower water quality conditions observed in the spring might be more representative of the longer-term water quality conditions in these watersheds than the higher quality conditions observed in the fall. An assessment of macroinvertebrates indicated that the biotic index was primarily influenced by nutrient loading due to excessive amounts of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) discharge from agricultural land uses. The PCA analysis found a correlation between turbidity, E. coli, and BI, suggesting that livestock grazing may adversely affect the water quality in this watershed. Moreover, this analysis found that N, P, and SC contribute greatly to the observed water quality variability. The results of this study can be used to improve decision-making strategies to improve water quality for the entire river basin.

Results showed a significant increase of all biomarker levels compared with controls. Moreover, the responses of four biomarkers fluctuated over time. BPH and GST activities showed a progressive increase from winter to autumn. CAT activity reached a maximum value in spring; while MDA concentration recorded a maximum value in summer. Seasonal variation of biomarkers arises from a complex interaction between exogenous and endogenous factors.

Changing River Ice Seasonality and Impacts on Interior Alaskan Communities	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												Subsistence harvesters in high latitudes rely on frozen rivers for winter access to local resources. During recent decades, interior Alaskan residents have observed changes in river ice regimes that are significant hindrances to travel and subsistence practices. We used remote sensing in combination with local observations to examine changes in seasonality of river breakup and freeze-up and to assess the implications on travel for subsistence harvesters. Spring and autumn air temperatures, respectively, were found to impact timing of breakup (-2.0 days degrees C-1) and freeze-up (+2.0 days degrees C-1). Spring air temperatures have increased by 0.2 degrees-0.6 degrees C decade(-1) over the last 62-93 years, depending on study area and time period. Local observations indicate that the breakup season has advanced by about 6 days over the last century. Autumn air temperatures have not changed over the long term, but have been generally warmer over the last 15 years. Over various time periods throughout the last century, we found no change in freeze-up timing for some communities, whereas other communities showed delays of 1.0-2.1 days decade(-1). The length of time the river was unsafe for travel during the freeze-up season was 2 to 3 times greater than during breakup. The duration of river ice cover for safe travel has declined over the last century and is expected to decline further as the climate continues to warm, thereby presenting new challenges to accessing subsistence resources and necessitating community adaptation.					; Brinkman, Todd/B-3578-2013	Brown, Dana/0000-0002-1195-7161; 													1948-8327	1948-8335				OCT	2018	10	4					625	640		10.1175/WCAS-D-17-0101.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-17-0101.1													WOS:000439920700002

Seasonal and annual trends in forage fish mercury concentrations, San Francisco Bay	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												San Francisco Bay is contaminated by mercury (Hg) due to historic and ongoing sources, and has elevated Hg concentrations throughout the aquatic food web. We monitored Hg in forage fish to indicate seasonal and interannual variations and trends. Interannual variation and long-term trends were determined by monitoring Hg bioaccumulation during September-November, for topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) and Mississippi silverside (Menidia audens) at six sites, over six years (2005 to 2010). Seasonal variation was characterized for arrow goby (Clevelandia ios) at one site, topsmelt at six sites, and Mississippi silverside at nine sites. Arrow goby exhibited a consistent seasonal pattern from 2008 to 2010, with lowest concentrations observed in late spring, and highest concentrations in late summer or early fall. In contrast, topsmelt concentrations tended to peak in late winter or early spring and silverside seasonal fluctuations varied among sites. The seasonal patterns may relate to seasonal shifts in net MeHg production in the contrasting habitats of the species. Topsmelt exhibited an increase in Alviso Slough from 2005 to 2010, possibly related to recent hypoxia in that site. Otherwise, directional trends for Hg in forage fish were not observed. For topsmelt and silverside, the variability explained by year was relatively low compared to sampling station, suggesting that interannual variation is not a strong influence on Hg concentrations. Although fish Hg has shown long-term declines in some ecosystems around the world, San Francisco Bay forage fish did not decline over the six-year monitoring period examined. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In Waigani Lake phytoplankton biomass varied seasonally with lower levels (100-200 mg chlorophyll a m-3) during the wet season increasing to over 400 mg chlorophyll a m-3 at the end of the dry season. Secchi disc depths varied between 0.11 and 0.34 m. Phytoplankton productivity in Waigani Lake was very high throughout the year (range: A(max) 4,370-21,000 mg O2 m-3 h-1) but production was lower during the wet season (range: A(max) 4,370-12,700 mg O2 m-3 h-1). High surface productivity was recorded from August to December except on sampling days when the weather was overcast. Productivity throughout the year declined rapidly with depth. Algal biomass in Barton Broad varied from 3-10 mg chlorophyll a m-3 in winter but increased in spring and was very high in summer (200-500 mg chlorophyll a m-3). Secchi disc depth varied from 0.21 in August 1976 to 1.76 m in December. Phytoplankton production in Barton Broad was low in winter (range: A(max) 247-1,250 mg O2 m-3 h-1) but increased markedly in spring and summer with the highest rate (A(max) 6,850 mg O2 m-3 h-1) being recorded in August. Surface inhibition was observed during summer except when the weather was overcast. Seasonality in nutrients and phytoplankton in Waigani Lake appear to be related to rainfall. Nutrient concentrations in Barton Broad are more closely related to phytoplankton activity which, in turn, correlates with seasonality in solar radiation.																			0020-9309						1991	76	1					105	120		10.1002/iroh.19910760111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760111													WOS:A1991GB67400010

We determined in situ hyperspectral data and TSM concentration data for Changdang Lake, China, to establish a TSM concentration inversion model. The model was applied using 60 Sentinel-2 images acquired from 2016 to 2021 to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of TSM concentration. Remote sensing images were also utilized to monitor the effect of ecological dredging in Changdang Lake. The following results were obtained: (1) Compared with four existing models, the TSM concentration inversion model established in this study exhibited higher accuracy and was suitable for Changdang Lake. (2) TSM concentrations obtained for the period 2016-2021 were higher in spring and summer, and lower in autumn and winter. (3) The dredging process influenced a small area of the surrounding water body, resulting in higher TSM concentrations. However, a subsequent reduction in TSM concentrations indicated that the ecological dredging project might improve the water quality of Changdang Lake to a considerable extent. Therefore, it was inferred that the use of Sentinel-2 images was effective for the long-term monitoring of water quality changes in small and medium-sized lakes.					; Yue, Yao/KIC-2405-2024; jiarui, shi/JAC-4211-2023	mingxiu, wang/0009-0008-2150-9929; Yao, Yue/0000-0001-5671-6399; shi, jiarui/0000-0003-3929-9655														2072-4292				NOV	2021	13	21							4230	10.3390/rs13214230	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13214230													WOS:000721056300001

Behavior of migrant shorebirds in saline lakes of the Southern Great Plains	WATERBIRDS												We recorded and compared diurnal and nocturnal time-activity budgets of American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana), Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes), Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), and Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor) on 21 saline lakes in the Southern Great Plains, USA, during spring and summer/fall 2002 and 2003 to examine importance of saline lakes as migratory stopover sites. All four species spent most of their time feeding (47-70%) and resting (7-37%) by day and at night during spring and fall migrations. Little time was spent in other behaviors. Time budgets differed among species and between seasons, likely due to different energy needs. Time spent foraging varied seasonally between saline lakes and freshwater playas for American Avocets and Least Sandpipers, likely due to differences in vegetation cover and availability of prey between these wetland types. For most species, time spent foraging and resting differed between day and night. Therefore, extrapolating diurnal activity budgets to the entire 24-hour period and from one type of habitat to another within the same region is not recommended. Saline lakes are used by migrant shorebirds as stopover sites where they replenish lipid stores. Conservation efforts should focus on preserving these unique wetlands and the freshwater springs that discharge in them.																			1524-4695					SEP	2007	30	3					326	334		10.1675/1524-4695(2007)030[0326:BOMSIS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2007)030[0326:BOMSIS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000250549900002

Deposition pins were used to study the amount and pattern of aeolian sand deposition on the lee slopes of GMB dune over 20 months. In the late fall and winter, sand supported by ice between the grains accumulated on the upper- to mid-slopes, and became over-steepened (38 degrees). During measurement periods containing two major storms with wind gusts up to 25 m/s, a total of 44% of the deposition on the lee slope occurred, compared to an average of 9% for comparable time periods between storms. Sand was delivered by mass movement to the lower slopes during the spring thaw. Very little sand was deposited on fee slopes during the summer. Maximum sand deposition occurred near the dune axis, oriented southwest-northeast, and then decreased rapidly along the limbs. Maximum sand transport and dune migration were oriented towards the northeast despite the dominant regional winds during the fall and winter being from the west and northwest. Arrays of anemometers and wind vanes were used to study airflow patterns within GMB dune on five different days. These studies indicate that steering of winds in the deflation area of the dune may be responsible for the northeasterly sediment transport. They also suggest, however, that the ability of the dune to steer winds, and thus, control the direction of sand transport and deposition, decreases when the angle between the oncoming winds and the dune axis is too great.

Such behavioural changes are commonly manifested in the movements and the energetic balance of individuals in relation to their species-specific physiological characteristics, habitat attributes and the environmental properties of their distribution ranges. We used GPS and acceleration data collected using transmitters on free-ranging birds to quantify annual movement patterns and estimate energy expenditure of the Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus, a large, soaring avian species which performs short-distance migration and spends its entire annual cycle in mid-latitudes. To assess the representativeness of our results, the transmitter effect was also tested. We found that daily trends in the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA; a proxy for energy expenditure) differed among seasons, with the highest values occurring during spring and the lowest during winter. Long inter-lake flights were very rare in winter, and the number of flights and ODBA during spring was higher than during summer, suggesting greater motivation to move in spring. Although transmitters may have affected the birds, as none of the tagged birds bred, we found seasonal differences in behaviour and activity level. The observed patterns in differences in activity levels, long-distance flights and flight characteristics between seasons suggest an annual rhythm of energy expenditure. These findings allow a better understanding of bird phenology, specifically regarding adaptations to wintering in a cold climate by reducing movement-driven energy expenditure. Finally, the identification of periods with high and low energy expenditure may guide future conservation efforts by adjusting conservation plans in accordance with changing needs during the annual cycle.

The atmospheric transport of pollutants from lowlands may add further stress to organisms inhabiting these environments. We investigated the environmental stress pressure on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from a high-mountain lake in the Cottian Alps (Piedmont, northwest Italy). To do this, males and females of brook trout were sampled from Balma Lake in summer (August) and autumn (October) 2017 in order to assess the influence of trace elements accumulation and environmental parameters (physicochemical parameters and nutrient characteristics of water) on oxidative stress biomarkers. Bioaccumulation of Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Pb, Ni, Se, and Zn and metallothionein levels were measured in muscle tissue of males and females. Liver, gills, kidney, and spleen tissue samples were analyzed for superoxide dismutase, catalase, total glutathione peroxidase, selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione Stransferase activity. Analysis of environmental parameters showed changes in biomarker levels with seasonal variations. Water temperature was significantly higher in summer than autumn (Wilcoxon test; p .0078), while pH was significantly higher in autumn than in summer (Wilcoxon test; p = .0078). Sex-related differences in oxidative stress biomarkers in tissues were unremarkable, whereas seasonal variability of oxidative stress biomarkers was observed, with major differences occurred for liver in summer and for gills, kidney, spleen and muscle in autumn. Positive coirelations between environmental parameters and biomarkers were noted. Major fluctuations in water temperature, pH, Cu, Pb and Hg produced changes in biomarker levels; however, increased food intake during the ice-free season was probably the main factor that influenced changes in oxidative stress biomarker levels in brook trout in this extreme ecosystem.

J	FULLER, A; COWELL, BC				FULLER, A; COWELL, BC			SEASONAL-VARIATION IN BENTHIC INVERTEBRATE RECOLONIZATION OF SMALL-SCALE DISTURBANCES IN A SUB-TROPICAL FLORIDA LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Approximately 11.5% of the littoral zone of a hypereutrophic Florida lake is disturbed by the construction of spawning beds by the cichlid fish, Sarotherodon aurea, during a single spawning season. Simulations of these beds were created during 3 seasons of the year to test for variation in recolonization rates and patterns in the benthic macroinvertebrate community. The seasonal variation in densities of benthic invertebrate populations suggested a direct relationship between reproductive activity and recolonization rate. Recolonization rates of the numerically dominant species, Polypedilum halterale (Diptera: Chironomidae), were much more rapid in the spring and summer than in the winter. Hyalella azteca and Glyptotendipes paripes attained peak population densities during the winter season when Polypedilum was present in low densities. These organisms invaded the disturbed area in unusually high abundances and later declined to background levels. The final result was a winter population with densities comparable to the control (undisturbed) area, but the species composition was different. Similarity between disturbed and control communities during the winter season only reached 67% a month after disturbance, while communities during the warmer months atained nearly 90% similarity in < 15 days. This lack of similarity during the winter indicates that disturbance, at the appropriate time, may play a role in community organizations.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	124	3					211	221		10.1007/BF00015237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015237													WOS:A1985ALL7100003
J	Hongve, D				Hongve, D			Seasonal mixing and genesis of endogenic meromixis in small lakes in Southeast Norway	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												The inland region of Southeast Norway contains many lakes with endogenic meromixis. A synoptic study of seasonal mixing was conducted in 27 oligo- and mesotrophic lakes with surface area 0.0013 - 7.4 km(2) and water colour 2-146 Hazen units. The scope was to identify properties of morphometric, optical and chemical nature that lead to development of endogenic meromixis. The summer mixing depths were found to depend on lake area and water colour. Small lakes (<0.3 km(2)) were incompletely aerated during the spring circulation and had hypolimnetic temperatures near the temperature of maximum density throughout the summer stagnation. Insubstantial autumn mixing is considered the primary reason lakes in this area develop meromixis. Iron and manganese concentrations in anoxic deep waters depend on concentrations in the sediments and on accumulation of dissolved inorganic carbon in the deep waters. Development of endogenic meromixis is favoured by iron concentration in the sediment more than 5% of dry weight and manganese more than 0.5% of dry weight.																			0029-1277						2002	33	2-3					189	206																WOS:000176668400005

The drought domain is characterized with anomalous warming and drying in the mid-lower troposphere as well as an evident anomalous subsidence. The favorable circulation anomalies for this drought are associated with the following two factors. One is the strongest negative-phase Arctic Oscillation during 2009/2010 winter that accompanies with a weakened Middle East Jet Stream (MEJS), the cyclonic anomaly over Arabian Sea (AS), the anticyclonic anomaly over Tibet and the cyclonic anomaly over Lake Baikal. The weakened MEJS, the AS cyclonic anomaly and the Tibet anticyclonic anomaly weaken the Southern Branch Trough (SBT) that directly decreases the moisture transport toward the southwestern China; the cyclonic anomaly over the Lake Baikal causes a deepened and westward shifted East Asian Major Trough (EAT) so that dry cold air behind the EAT easily invades down to southwestern China. The AS cyclonic anomaly favors the westward extension of Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH). The westward extension of WPSH is also associated with the second factor that is the El Nino Modoki event during 2009/2010 autumn-winter. The intensification and westward extension of WPSH enhance the local subsidence, weaken the SBT and exacerbate this drought.

J	Schwefel, R; Müller, B; Boisgontier, H; Wüest, A				Schwefel, Robert; Mueller, Beat; Boisgontier, Helene; Wuest, Alfred			Global warming affects nutrient upwelling in deep lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Measures to reduce lake phosphorus concentrations have been encouragingly successful in many parts of the world. After significant eutrophication in the twentieth century, nutrient concentrations have declined in many natural settings. In addition to these direct anthropogenic impacts, however, climate change is also altering various processes in lakes. Its effects on lacustrine nutrient budgets remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the epilimnion of the meromictic Lake Zug under present and future climatic conditions. Results are compared with those of other deep lakes. Data showed that TP transported from the hypolimnion by convective winter mixing was the most important source of TP for the epilimnion, reaching values more than ten times higher than the external input from the catchment. We found a logarithmic relationship between winter mixing depth (WMD) and epilimnetic TP content in spring. Warming climate affects WMD mainly due to its dependence on autumn stratification. Model simulations predict a reduction of average WMD from 78 (current) to 65m in 2085 assuming IPCC scenario A2. Other scenarios show similar but smaller changes in the future. In scenario A2, climate change is predicted to reduce epilimnetic TP concentrations by up to 24% during warm winters and may consequently introduce significant year-to-year variability in primary productivity.

Methodology: Water samples from three sampling sites, the open surface, deposit and inlet, were tested for physical, chemical, and biological parameters following the standard methods of APHA. This comprehensive assessment, conducted between June 2022 and July 2023, spanned the monsoon,autumn, winter, spring, and summer seasons. Developmental stages of D. rerio embryos were observed, and their heart rates were counted and compared between the sampling sites. Results: The study revealed significant limnological changes influenced by seasons at all sampling stations. The open surface water station showed superior results to deposit and inlet sites. Notably, the study found that the water quality in the three stations moderately influence the aquatic life. Interpretation: Herohalli Lake plays a crucial role in the region's microclimate.

J	TILZER, MM				TILZER, MM			ESTIMATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON LOSS RATES FROM DAILY PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATES AND OBSERVED BIOMASS CHANGES IN LAKE CONSTANCE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Potential growth rates of phytoplankton biomass were estimated year-round from production rates and biomass and were compared with observed changes in euphotic phytoplankton biomass. Potential growth was always greater than observed growth. The discrepancy between both is attributed to losses. Relative loss rates showed wide seasonal fluctuations with highest values during the spring bloom and autumnal phytoplankton maximum, respectively. Loss rates of photoassimilated C showed one peak in late May which lead to a clear-water phase. Relative loss rates were highly correlated with potential growth rates; observed growth rates were not. Most losses occur immediately after the production process and do not lead to increases in biomass. During the spring bloom grazing by zooplankton is the single most important factor leading to losses from the phytoplankton community. During that time, 80-98% of overall losses can be accounted for by grazing, sedimentation and wash-out combined. During brief periods in summer and autumn, sedimentation rates comprised > 50% of overall losses. In autumn only 30-40% of overall losses were due to the above-mentioned processes. Residual losses can be attributed to respiration, lysis and bacterial remineralization. Grazing, respiration and lysis lead to recycling of C and nutrients. Sedimentation rate measurements suggest an average euphotic C regeneration rate of 85%. For the transfer efficiency of C along the food chain the relative significance of respiratory losses in overall losses is of fundamental importance.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1984	6	2					309	324		10.1093/plankt/6.2.309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/6.2.309													WOS:A1984SH59200008

This study presents a Great Lakes climate change projection that has employed the two-way coupling of a regional climate model with a 3-D lake model (GLARM) to resolve 3-D hydrodynamics essential for large lakes. Using the three carefully selected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs), we show that the GLARM ensemble average substantially reduces surface air temperature and precipitation biases of the driving GCM ensemble average in present-day climate simulations. The improvements are not only displayed from an atmospheric perspective but are also evident in the accurate simulations of lake temperature and ice coverage. We further present the GLARM projected climate change for the mid-21st century (2030-2049) and the late 21st century (2080-2099) in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Under RCP 8.5, the Great Lakes basin is projected to warm by 1.3-2.1 degrees C by the mid-21st century and 4.1-5.0 degrees C by the end of the century relative to the early century (2000-2019). Moderate mitigation (RCP 4.5) reduces the mid-century warming to 0.8-1.8 degrees C and late-century warming to 1.8-2.7 degrees C. Annual precipitation in GLARM is projected to increase for the entire basin, varying from 0 % to 13 % during the mid-century and from 9 % to 32 % during the late century in different scenarios and simulations. The most significant increases are projected in spring and fall when current precipitation is highest and a minimal increase in winter when it is lowest. Lake surface temperatures (LSTs) are also projected to increase across the five lakes in all of the simulations, but with strong seasonal and spatial variability. The most significant LST increases occur in Lakes Superior and Ontario. The strongest warming is projected in spring that persists into the summer, resulting from earlier and more intense stratification in the future. In addition, diminishing winter stratification in the future suggests the transition from dimictic lakes to monomictic lakes by the end of the century. In contrast, a relatively smaller increase in LSTs during fall and winter is projected with heat transfer to the deep water due to the strong mixing and energy required for ice melting. Correspondingly, the highest monthly mean ice cover is projected to reduce to 3 %-15 % and 10 %-40 % across the lakes by the end of the century in RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, respectively. In the coastal regions, ice duration is projected to decrease by up to 60 d.					; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Huang, Chenfu/G-9662-2014	Kayastha, Miraj B/0000-0002-9956-8362; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X; 													1991-959X	1991-9603				JUN 9	2022	15	11								10.5194/gmd-15-4425-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4425-2022													WOS:000808126900001
J	Nausch, M; Nausch, G; Wasmund, N; Nagel, K				Nausch, Monika; Nausch, Guenther; Wasmund, Norbert; Nagel, Klaus			Phosphorus pool variations and their relation to cyanobacteria development in the Baltic Sea: A three-year study	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Diazotrophic cyanobacteria are the dominant organisms in the phytoplankton community in summer in the Baltic Sea, and can form huge surface blooms. The excess of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) after the spring phytoplankton bloom in May and its decline until summer has been used in calculations and modelling of nitrogen fixation rates. However, this method was based mainly on data obtained in May and July or August. The period of cyanobacteria development was not covered. In 2001, 2004 and 2005, from May until August, phosphorus and other pool concentrations were investigated at a higher resolution, and related to cyanobacteria development to restore this temporal inconsistency. This study addresses the importance for cyanobacteria development of (a) winter convection, (b) the DIP excess in May, and (c) organic phosphorus pools. Our results did not show a relationship between DIP concentrations in May, as a result of convection processes in winter and assimilation by phytoplankton in the spring bloom, and the occurrence or intensity of cyanobacteria blooms in summer. The DIP excess in May was not additively stored as particulate organic phosphorus (POP) during its disappearance. It did, however, equate the current POP in the same order of magnitude as POP was exported. Thus, the POP pool remained constant until June. The DIP excess supported only between 46.8% and 84.6% of the new phytoplankton production in June, requiring an additional phosphorus source for summer autotrophy. Cyanobacteria seem to develop in July on the basis of POP measured in June. In 2001, this source was enough to explain cyanobacteria biomass increase, which was accompanied by an increase in particulate CT ratio. In 2005, this process was unable to explain the biomass production in July supporting the requirement for additional phosphorus. In summary, the use of DIP excess in May is insufficient for modelling cyanobacteria blooms and the calculation of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria in summer: using May excess DIP results in an underestimation of the possible summer fixation rate. Additional phosphorus sources, which are not included in the calculations, seem to be necessary. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are no data available on the simultaneity or the rate of onset of the seasonal changes in Europe. Based on the microfacies and geochemical analyses of seasonally laminated varved sediments from Holzmaar, we present evidence of differences in duration and onset time of changes in summer temperature and winter rainfall during the 8.2 ka event. Since both summer and winter climate signals are co-registered within a single varve, there can be no ambiguity about the phasing and duration of the signals. Our data show that the onset and withdrawal of the 8.2 ka summer cooling occurred within a year, and that summer rains were reduced or absent during the investigated period. The onset of cooler summers preceded the onset of winter dryness by ca. 28 years. In view of the differences in nature and duration of the impact of the 8.2 ka event we suggest that a clearer definition of the 8.2 ka event (summer cooling or winter cooling/dryness) needs to be developed. Based on regional comparison and available modelling studies we also discuss the roles of solar variability, changes in North Atlantic Thermohaline circulation, and North Atlantic Circulation (NAO) during the period under consideration. Wavelet analyses of seasonal laminae indicates that the longer NAO cycles, linked to changes in the N. Atlantic temperatures, were more frequent during the drier periods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nichols, DS; Verry, ES				Nichols, DS; Verry, ES			Stream flow and ground water recharge from small forested watersheds in north central Minnesota	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In hydrologic studies of forested watersheds, the component of the water balance most likely to be poorly defined or neglected is deep seepage. In the complex glaciated terrain of the northern Lake States, subsurface water movement can be substantial. On the Marcell experimental forest (MEF) in north-central Minnesota, ground water table elevations measured in observation wells in recharge areas were used to calculate rates of ground water recharge. In northern Minnesota winters, precipitation is stored on the surface as snow and ground water recharge ceases. Water table elevations in recharge areas decline over winter at calculable rates. Deviations from these rates during other times of the year are due to ground water recharge. On 10-50 ha watersheds on the MEF, ground water recharge varies among watersheds but constitutes about 40% of the total water yield. Annual ground water recharge amounts were found to vary linearly with precipitation. Even in high precipitation years, the infiltration capacity of the watersheds was not exceeded. Regression equations were developed relating yearly ground water recharge, stream flow, and total water yield, to seasonal precipitation amounts, summer and autumn precipitation during the previous year, and non-winter air temperature.

Fluctuation of water level is an important factor of hydrological process which is a guarantee of ecosystem health and biodiversity conservation. To measure its spatial-temporal variation, classical statistical methods and permutation entropy were employed: 1) Variation of water level downstream of Poyang Lake during one year follows a periodical pattern, while it is random in upper reaches. That is, the range of water level in upper reaches is much less than that in downstream. 2) Fluctuation of water level in winter and spring is more complicated, more irregular and more random than that in other seasons. This is because in winter and spring, precipitation directly causes rising in water level rather than generating surface runoff, while it is reversed in summer. 3) The ranges, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and fluctuation of water level decrease with rising in elevation. 4) In sub-basin scale, fluctuation of water level in upper reaches is more complicated than that in downstream, especially along one river. Mechanically, catchment size and confluence process may be the main factors influencing fluctuation of water level over Poyang Lake basin.

Both remote sensing data and botanical reference data were gathered for mentioned habitats in the Lower (LB) and Upper Biebrza (UB) River Valley and the Janowskie Forest (JF) in different seasonal stages. Several different classification scenarios were tested, and the ones that gave the best results for analyzed habitats were indicated in each campaign. In the final stage, a recommended term of data acquisition, as well as a list of remote sensing products, which allowed us to achieve the highest accuracy mapping for these two types of wetland habitats, were presented. Designed classification scenarios integrated different hyperspectral products such as Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) bands, spectral indices and products derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data representing topography (developed in SAGA), or statistical products (developed in OPALS-Orientation and Processing of Airborne Laser Scanning). The image classifications were performed using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm and a multi-classification approach. As part of the research, the correlation analysis of the developed remote sensing products was carried out, and the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFE-CV) analysis was performed to select the most important RS sub-products and thus increase the efficiency and accuracy of developing the final habitat distribution maps. The classification results showed that alkaline fens are better identified in summer (mean F1-SCORE equals 0.950 in the UB area, and 0.935 in the LB area), transition mires and quaking bogs that evolved on/or in the vicinity of alkaline fens in summer and autumn (mean F1-SCORE equals 0.931 in summer, and 0.923 in autumn in the UB area), and transition mires and quaking bogs that evolved on dystrophic lakes in spring and summer (mean F1-SCORE equals 0.953 in spring, and 0.948 in summer in the JF area). The study also points out that the classification accuracy of both wetland habitats is highly improved when combining selected hyperspectral products (MNF bands, spectral indices) with ALS topographical and statistical products. This article demonstrates that information provided by the synergetic use of data from different sensors can be used in mapping and monitoring both Natura 2000 wetland habitats for its future functional assessment and/or protection activities planning with high accuracy.

Better understanding of the spatial distribution of biotic communities in wetlands is not only an important question in ecology, but also critical for biodiversity conservation. From March 2022 to February 2023, 12 monthly surveys were conducted on 10 provincially significant wetlands in the Huaibei Plain using transect and point-count methods. In this study, a two-way ANOVA was used to compare the differences in species, taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds across the four seasons and the six habitats. A total of 129,916 individuals, 218 bird species belonging to 54 families and 18 orders were identified during the survey. During spring, species richness was significantly higher in rivers (55.67 +/- 4.93), shelterbelts (47.67 +/- 6.51) and gardens (44.67 +/- 5.29) compared to farmlands, lakes and ponds. In contrast, farmland in summer exhibited greater species richness (SR) (46.67 +/- 7.00), Shannon-Wiener (3.13 +/- 0.10), Pielou index (0.82 +/- 0.02) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) (1431.31 +/- 129.92) than shelterbelts, gardens and lakes. River, lake and pond habitats showed notably higher taxonomic diversity (TD), functional diversity (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) during autumn, while the highest functional diversity (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) levels were observed in rivers, lakes and ponds in winter.

There were no significant differences in bird diversity within habitats across different seasons, but the species richness (SR) and abundance of ecotypes were significantly different amongst the four seasons, indicating notable seasonal fluctuations in the species composition of the community in this area. Aquatic habitats such as the lakes, rivers and ponds are the most abundant areas of bird diversity in the wetland complex in the Huaibei Plain, providing stop-overs and wintering places for migrants on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Meanwhile, the autumn and winter are the key periods for waterbird protection in this area. Our study provides important baseline data on the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of bird communities in the Huaibei Plain and may help in developing scientifically effective management and conservation plans.

Exceptional summer warming leads to contrasting outcomes for methane cycling in small Arctic lakes of Greenland	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In thermally stratified lakes, the greatest annual methane emissions typically occur during thermal overturn events. In July of 2012, Greenland experienced significant warming that resulted in substantial melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and enhanced runoff events. This unusual climate phenomenon provided an opportunity to examine the effects of short-term natural heating on lake thermal structure and methane dynamics and compare these observations with those from the following year, when temperatures were normal. Here, we focus on methane concentrations within the water column of five adjacent small lakes on the ice-free margin of southwestern Greenland under open-water and ice-covered conditions from 2012-2014. Enhanced warming of the epilimnion in the lakes under open-water conditions in 2012 led to strong thermal stability and the development of anoxic hypolimnia in each of the lakes. As a result, during open-water conditions, mean dissolved methane concentrations in the water column were significantly (p < 0.0001) greater in 2012 than in 2013. In all of the lakes, mean methane concentrations under ice-covered conditions were significantly (p < 0.0001) greater than under open-water conditions, suggesting spring overturn is currently the largest annual methane flux to the atmosphere. As the climate continues to warm, shorter ice cover durations are expected, which may reduce the winter inventory of methane and lead to a decrease in total methane flux during ice melt. Under open-water conditions, greater heat income and warming of lake surface waters will lead to increased thermal stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia, which will consequently result in increased water column inventories of methane. This stored methane will be susceptible to emissions during fall over-turn, which may result in a shift in greatest annual efflux of methane from spring melt to fall overturn. The results of this study suggest that interannual variation in ground-level air temperatures may be the primary driver of changes in methane dynamics because it controls both the duration of ice cover and the strength of thermal stratification.

There is a paucity of baseline data documenting the geochemical dynamics of nutrients and oxygen beneath ice cover of high Arctic lakes, a gap that presents a challenge when attempting to understand the impacts of a rapidly changing Arctic on lake ecosystems. We present an annual cycle of temperature, oxygen, and silicate data from Immerk Lake on Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, Canada. Water column oxygen concentrations decreased while silicate concentrations increased during the ice-covered season. Ice cover melting during spring-summer is associated with rapid net decreases of the silicate standing stock at almost 3 times the rate of its net increase over winter. These data show the importance of the extended winter season for regeneration of silicate, an essential nutrient for diatom populations, which are important members of the phytoplankton community and carbon cycle of Arctic lakes. These data collected 60 years ago serve as a benchmark and document the water column oxygen and silicate dynamics in an Arctic lake during ice formation, winter darkness, and ice-cover melting periods.

Turbidity and Estimated Phosphorus Retention in a Reconnected Lake Erie Coastal Wetland	WATER												Nearly all of the wetlands in the coastal zone of Lake Erie have been degraded or destroyed since the 1860s, and most of those that remain are separated from their watersheds by earthen dikes. Hydrologic isolation of these wetlands disrupts ecosystem benefits typical to Great Lakes coastal wetlands, particularly the ability to trap sediments and retain nutrients when inundated by runoff and lake water. High-frequency measurements of turbidity and discharge were taken in 2013 and 2014 to observe turbidity and water flow dynamics to estimate total phosphorus flux of a hydrologically reconnected diked wetland pool in the Crane Creek-Lake Erie wetland complex. Modeled estimates suggest the reconnected pool retained 8% of the total phosphorus loading in 2013 and 10% in 2014, which included short periods of phosphorus export to Lake Erie. Water flowing out of the wetland generally had lower turbidity than inflowing water, but flux in and out of the pool varied seasonally and was linked to changes in lake-levels, seiche dynamics, and weather conditions. More frequent storms, higher winds, and stronger seiches in the spring and fall created turbidity patterns that suggest more phosphorus retention than in summer or winter. Estimates suggest that phosphorus was released during the summer when higher lake levels and the absence of frequent storms, larger short-term seiche oscillations, and potentially soil oxygen availability were driving flux dynamics. This study demonstrated that reestablishing lake hydrology through reconnection of wetland pools can reduce loading and alter timing of delivery of total phosphorus to Lake Erie.					; Carter, Glenn/P-4744-2016; Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022	Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; Carter, Glenn/0000-0001-6630-7513; 														2073-4441				JUN	2022	14	12							1853	10.3390/w14121853	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14121853													WOS:000816016900001

Strong dependence between phytoplankton and water chemistry in a large temperate lake: spatial and temporal perspective	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd European Large Lakes Symposium	SEP, 2012	Lake Constance, GERMANY					In lakes, spatial and temporal variability of water chemistry and phytoplankton are characteristic phenomena although often difficult to link together. This motivated us to study their interplay in Lake Vanajanselka, a eutrophic lake in Finland. We hypothesized that in summer spatial and temporal differences in phytoplankton and water chemistry can be extended in comparison to spring and autumn. Therefore, chlorophyll a and water chemistry was examined by six sampling campaigns with 15 sampling sites over the lake in May-October 2009-2010. In summer, chlorophyll, pH, and oxygen were horizontally and vertically unevenly distributed in the lake, and in the epilimnion pH and oxygen showed a distinct diurnal variability suggesting high photosynthesis during the day. Daily > 1 pH unit difference between the sites and 2.5 pH unit difference between the epi- and hypolimnion were found. In agreement with pH and oxygen, NO3-N and NH4-N could be unevenly distributed in the epilimnion. In autumn no spatial differences were found, however. The results emphasized that algae and cyanobacteria were responsible, at least partly, for the variability in water chemistry in the surface layer, and short- and long-term gradients in space and time need to be considered when productive lakes are studied.					; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Tossavainen, Marika/0000-0003-3334-1496; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2014	731	1					139	150		10.1007/s10750-013-1777-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1777-1													WOS:000334493700011

The lakes, Llydaw, Cwellyn, Padarn, Maelog and Coron ranged from very oligotrophic to nutrient-rich. Attention was focused on chlamydomonad flagellates, diatoms, blue-green algae and euglenoids and the different proportions of these in algae in the epipelon of lakes of contrasting water quality. A total of 75 algal taxa was found in the 5 lakes, 25 were species of volvocalean flagellates. Mean annual population density of these flagellates differed by an order of magnitude between the lakes. The greatest population density was recorded for Chlamydomonas anticontata Schiller in nutrient-rich Llyn Maelog. Twenty species of pennate diatoms were recorded frequently in the epipelon. In the nutrient-rich lakes, Maelog and Coron, pennate diatoms were dominant on the sediments, where they exhibited population maxima in spring and autumn. Increase in numbers of epipelic diatoms was recorded when silica concentrations were minimum in the overlying lake waters. Navicula hungarica Grun. achieved the maximum population density, 260,000 cells .cntdot. cm-2. Euglenoids formed large epipelic populations during late-summer and autumn in these nutrient-rich lakes. Blue-green algae were more important, proportionally, in the nutrient-poor mountain lakes, which had sediments of higher organic content. Chlamydomonads were the major algal component of the epipelon in the mountain lakes, Llydaw and Cwellyn, where the sediments were characterized by larger particle size, and higher organic content. In the nutrient-rich lakes, where the sediments had higher Ca content, chlamydomonads formed significant populations only during spring and summer, when nutrient levels were minimal in the overlying lakewaters.																				1529-8817					1984	20	1					109	124		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1984.00109.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1984.00109.x													WOS:A1984SJ68200015

Biomass (wet weight mu g.l(-1) and chlorophyll a) and cell density have been monitored from March to November over two years. The annual maximum for phytoplankton (biomass and cell density) occurs in spring; it is dominated by diatoms and their decline starts with a lack of silica in the environment and also with minimum cellular concentration of chlorophyll a. A clear phase results from the sedimentation of the diatoms and lasts through the summer. In autumn, there is a marked increase in primary production but a low biomass, the latter being regulated by predation. With the autumn mixing, small species experience a rapid growth which is detected only in terms of cell density; the poor increase in biomass values compared with those of the summer is due chiefly to the presence of Gonyostomum semen and the slight revival of diatoms. The different phases of phytoplankton development are analysed and compared with the P.E.G. model proposed by Sommer et al. (1986). The establishment of thermal stratification is the dominant element in the functioning of the Pareloup reservoir, each year, it determines the start of a cyclic phytoplankton succession.																			0003-4088					JAN	1991	27	3					197	214		10.1051/limn/1991015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1991015													WOS:000208073100001

Spatial variation in White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) refueling rate near a migratory barrier	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Stopover sites are essential to bird migration between wintering and breeding grounds, but annual variation in use and habitat conditions make it difficult to determine which sites are most critical for conservation. By studying physiological factors that may influence a bird's behavior when choosing and using a stopover site, researchers can target certain species or locations and more efficiently invest in conservation efforts. in spring 2013 and 2014, we studied stopover refueling performance in a common northeastern spring migrant, the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), at 2 locations near the south shore of Lake Ontario. We used morphological measurements and physiological techniques that assessed the concentration of the blood metabolite plasma triglyceride as a measure of fat deposition and feeding efficiency. We found that birds captured at an inland location had a significantly higher body condition score than birds captured at a coastal stopover site within 0.5 km of the shore; a trend toward higher triglyceride concentrations was also noted at the inland location. We found no significant differences in triglyceride concentrations between White-throated Sparrow color morphs, in contrast to previous studies performed during fall migration. Our results suggest that spring migrants arriving in the area in good energetic condition may begin their cross-lake journey directly from the inland site, while birds in poorer condition may "pile up" at the lakeshore and then compete with other migrants for available resources, slowing their fat deposition rate. Our results also reinforce the importance of protecting high-quality stopover habitat where birds congregate near geographic barriers but suggest that inland habitat patches are important stopover sites that may allow some migrants to bypass nearshore areas of intense competition.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				DEC	2018	130	4					891	901		10.1676/1559-4491.130.4.891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/1559-4491.130.4.891													WOS:000458461700007

In laboratory cultures, we present evidence that the seasonal appearance of the sexual Artemia tunisiana (the dominant winter-spring population), and of two parthenogenetic populations of Artemia (the dominant spring-summer populations) in certain Spanish saltworks is controlled by temperature through its effect on reproductive and survival traits. Minimum and maximum reproductive output and survival for the sexual and parthenogenetic populations, respectively, occurred at a typical temperature (24 degrees C) of the late-spring season when the sexual population is replaced by parthenogenetic forms. Furthermore, the high production and hatchability of cysts from the sexual population at low temperatures (15 degrees C), and of the parthenogenetic populations at middle temperature (24 degrees C), indicate the role of dormancy as an adaptation regulating seasonal occurrence.

This study investigated the seasonal and spatial dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in Juam Lake, a significant reservoir in South Korea, across multiple sampling periods (spring and autumn 2021-2022). Physicochemical parameters, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations, exhibited distinct seasonal patterns, ranging from 13-15 degrees C in spring to 26-27 degrees C in autumn. Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) analysis revealed clear seasonal succession in dominant plankton groups. Phytoplankton communities shifted from Chlorophyta dominance in spring 2021 to Cryptophyceae prominence in spring 2022, while Bacillariophyceae and Chrysophyceae increased in autumn 2022. Zooplankton communities displayed alternating dominance patterns, with rotifers prevalent in spring seasons and Copepoda dominating autumn samples. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that water temperature (p < 0.0001) and dissolved oxygen (p = 0.001) strongly influenced community structure, while water depth was not a significant factor (p = 0.73). Alpha diversity indices revealed higher diversity metrics in middle and outflow sites, with benthic zones consistently exhibiting the highest Shannon diversity for both plankton groups. Correlation analysis identified key indicator taxa with distinct environmental preferences, such as Stephanodiscus showing strong negative relationships with water temperature (-0.66) and total organic carbon (-0.70), while Trichocerca displayed positive correlations with water temperature (0.55). The sampling investigation of the plankton community in Juam Lake using eDNA provides valuable insights into the complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and highlights that seasonality is more important than spatial factors (flow point and water depth) in structuring these aquatic communities in a controlled Juam Lake. In particular, the absence of spatial differences following water depth in shallow lakes may be reflected in establishing more efficient lake sampling plans in the future.

To investigate the status of new settlement, postlarvae and juveniles of the prawn were collected using rake sledge nets on the tidal flats in Ise Bay, Mikawa Bay, and Lake Hamana on the Pacific coast of central Japan. During the study period from summer to winter in 2018, 2019, and 2020, settlement of natural postlarvae was observed despite extremely low stock levels of the adults. The peak of the settlement occurred from late summer to autumn although it used to generally occur in early summer in years with a high stock level. The body size of the prawn captured by fisheries is known to be smaller in years with a low stock level than in years with a high stock level. A possible reason for the delayed settlement is thought to be related to the decrease in the number of larger individuals which are known to spawn earlier than smaller ones.																			0021-5392	1349-998X					2022	88	2					40	48		10.2331/suisan.21-00025	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.21-00025													WOS:000772737900001

The annual concentration of total atmospheric PBDEs was 220 pg m(-3); BDE-209 was most abundant (average 41% of total PBDEs), followed by BDE-47 (17%) and BDE-28 (15%). The relative abundance of tetra- and tri-BDE congeners (including BDE-47, -28, -49, -66, and -17) instead of BDE-99 indicated that a specific penta-BDE formulation might be produced and/or consumed in this region. The source was confirmed by the analysis of air-water gas exchange, which was nearly at equilibrium in spring and summer but displayed strong volatilization flux in autumn and winter, especially for BDE-28, indicating the potential wastewater discharge of PBDEs into the lake. In addition to PBDEs, hexabromobenzene, 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane, decabromodiphenylethane, and Dechlorane Plus were detected in air samples, with an annual mean concentration of 23 pg m-3 for decabromodiphenylethane, and <4 pg m(-3) for the others.

However in the Hammam Debagh reservoir (Algeria), P. rubescens and Microcystis sp. co-occur and sometimes proliferate. With the aim of identifying the main factors and processes involved in this unusual cohabitation, water samples were collected monthly from February 2013 to June 2015 at the subsurface at four sampling stations and along the entire water column at one sampling station. In addition, the composition of the cyanobacterial communities was estimated by Illumina sequencing of a 16S rRNA gene fragment from samples collected over one year (October 2013-November 2014). This molecular approach showed that the Hammam Debagh reservoir displays high species richness (89 species) but very low diversity due to the high dominance of Microcystis in this community. Furthermore, it appears that Planktothrix rubescens and Microcystis sp. coexisted (from September to January) but proliferated alternately (Spring 2015 for P. rubescens and Spring 2014 and Autumn 2014/2015 for Microcystis). The main factors and processes explaining these changes in bloom-forming species seem to be related to the variation in the depth of the lake during the mixing period and to the water temperatures during the winter prior to the bloom season in spring.

Yet the magnitude of their methane emissions during an entire cold season is uncertain due to scarce measurements. While wetlands are known to be the highest natural emitters of methane, emissions from northern lakes are an uncertain component of terrestrial carbon budgets. To evaluate the importance of methane emissions from a subarctic lake during winter and spring, surface methane fluxes were recorded with the eddy covariance method in a subarctic fen-type wetland and in an adjacent shallow lake, from freezeup to complete ice out. The fen was a steady emitter of methane throughout winter. While no detectable flux was observed from the ice-covered lake surface during winter, it was the largest methane source of the landscape in spring, with a cumulative release 1.7-fold higher than at the fen, accounting for 53% of annual lake emissions. The high temporal resolution of the measurements allowed making a direct link between breakdown of the temperature stratification after ice breakup and the highest release of methane from the lake surface. A sediment upwelling at the end of the thaw season likely contributed to these emissions. We suggest that, unlike wetlands, shallow seasonally ice-covered lakes can have their highest methane emission potential in the cold season, likely dominating the spring methane release of subarctic landscapes with high lake coverage.					; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021; Friborg, Thomas/E-5433-2015; Dengel, Sigrid/F-7488-2016	Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059; Friborg, Thomas/0000-0001-5633-6097; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV	2015	120	11					2289	2305		10.1002/2015JG003137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JG003137													WOS:000368908700013

Production of dissolved organic matter from lily pads (Nymphaea odorata) in a mesotrophic freshwater lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Macrophytes are potentially an important dissolved organic matter (DOM) source in lakes. To assess the effect of lily pads (Nymphaea odorata) on DOM, optical properties and dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC) were measured over a year in Lake Louise, Pacific Northwest, USA. Lily pads were widespread around the shoreline during summer, dying back in the fall. Some optical indices (slope ratio, index of recent autochthonous contribution, fluorescence index) indicated the lake was dominated by DOM from terrestrial sources for most of the year. Indicators of autochthonous production in a few winter samples were attributed to phytoplankton. DOC concentrations and precipitation were not correlated, but DOC was positively correlated with absorption coefficient at 350 nm (alpha 350). DOC and alpha 350 were highest in summer and decreased in the winter wet season, which would be consistent with an in situ lake source being diluted by rainfall as a possible explanation for this. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra of lake waters and lily pad leachates indicated humic and protein material components. The plant leachates had slope ratio, fluorescence index, and index of recent autochthonous contribution values consistent with terrestrially derived DOM and lake waters. Higher DOC and alpha 350 in the summer were associated with some lower optical indices (specific ultra-violet absorbance, spectral slope, humification index, fluorescence/absorbance ratio ratios), consistent with material derived from lily pads. Estimates indicated lily pads contributed as much to the lake DOM pool in the summer dry season as watershed terrestrial inputs in the winter wet season, suggesting that DOM production by lily pads may account for a significant portion of the carbon pool in smaller lakes.

Stable isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen both showed temporal variation with heaviest values in summer accompanying the progression of cyanobacterial bloom, and tended to be low in winter and early spring. During four seasons, the delta N-15 values of plankton (>50 mu m) were generally enriched more than those of small size classes (<20 mu m), which indicated size-dependent consumption. But the regressions between delta N-15 and the logarithmic organism size were only significant at 3 of 7 occasions, reflecting more numerous trophic interactions per size-class. The results indicated that a size-structured approach was partially successful in the depiction of the microbial food web structure in Taihu Lake. Zooplankton was largely depleted in C-13 relative to the size-fractionated SPOM. There existed a continuum in the delta C-13 differences between SPOM and zooplankton from highly productive summer to poorly productive winter. These differences probably reflected the high contribution of nonalgal allochthonous sources of organic carbon in winter and the less detritus assimilation efficiency by zooplankton.

The lake's inundation area is heavily influenced by basin rainfall and also by the Yangtze River's water flows. Exploring the lake's inundation variation in response to drought conditions is of great importance for developing effective management planning for local water resources and for mitigating future drought. Here we demonstrate how satellites can reflect the lake's inundation changes and processes under typical hydro-climatic droughts. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) medium-resolution data collected between 2000 and 2011, we documented the tempo-spatial variation characteristics of water inundation areas and two typical droughts in 2006 and 2011. 2006 was a hydrologic drought year, which occurred due to an abnormal change in the Yangtze River's water flows. A dramatic shrinkage of the inundation area mainly occurred in autumn and winter. In contrast, 2011 was a hydro-climatic drought year, which resulted from the complicated influence of both the Poyang Lake basin and Yangtze River. The lake shrinkage appeared more severe during spring-summer, when about 70% of the inundation area disappeared before July. The results should be valuable for ecological conservation and water resource management in the Poyang Lake region.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Taiyuan, China, are one class of the most hazardous air pollutants due to the high emission intensity from coal consumption. To better understand the PAHs removing from the atmosphere, 16 USEPA priority PAHs (except for naphthalene) in the particle dry deposition samples were detected from August 2013 to November 2014 at an urban site in Taiyuan. Dry deposition fluxes of particles were estimated as 157.44-358.17 mg/(m(2).d), with the highest value in spring and lowest in autumn. Particle dry deposition fluxes of P15-PAHs ranged from 2436.20 to 14,967.36 ng/(m(2).d), and was the highest in winter and lowest in summer. Higher PAHs particle dry deposition fluxes were related to higher PAHs emission, lower air temperature, less precipitation as well as wind speed. Overall dry deposition velocities of Sigma 15-PAHs were 0.056 +/- 0.027 cm/s in winter and 0.42 +/- 0.050 cm/s in summer, respectively, and high molecular weight PAHs showed low dry deposition velocities. Positive matrix factorization model's results indicated that coking, vehicle exhaust, coal combustion were the primary PAHs sources in particle dry deposition samples, accounting for 18.64%, 26.54% and 54.82% of total PAHs, respectively. The toxic equivalent concentrations (BaPeq) of Sigma 15-PAHs in particle dry deposition samples was in the range of 0.69-2.94 mg/g, which might be a good explanation to high soil PAHs concentrations reported in Shanxi province, China. Furthermore, this work could prove the significance of coal combustion, and related pollution control works are needed to conduct to alleviate the PAHs pollution situation.

J	Biber, MV; Gulacar, FO; Buffle, J				Biber, MV; Gulacar, FO; Buffle, J			Seasonal variations in principal groups of organic matter in a eutrophic lake using pyrolysis/GC/MS	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM), which affect its interactions with and therefore the transport of colloids and particles, depend on the evolution of its individual components. Information on the temporal variations of the components of the organic matter of a well-studied eutrophic lake (Bret, VD, Switzerland) was extracted using pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The influence of aquagenic organic matter was found to be at a maximum in summer. The soil-derived organic matter, on the other hand, was found in larger proportions in winter and spring. The appearance of hydroxypropanone in the pyrolysis fragments in the summer months indicates that this portion of the organic matter is aquagenic and very fresh. The dominance of furaldehyde in pyrolysates during the rest of the year indicates the presence of polysaccharides may be of either aquagenic or pedogenic origin. The absence of lignin fragments found in the NOM in this lake suggests that lignin-containing components of terrestrial organic matter are not leached out from the soil in significant quantities. A correlation was found between 3-day cumulative rainfall and the proportion of terrestrial components in the identified organic matter in the spring. This correlation disappeared in the summer, probably because of a higher vegetal cover and the masking effect of the high aquagenic productivity. These factors are also likely to be of importance in more complicated lacustrine systems.

In particular, the emissions of methane from lakes and reservoirs are suspected of almost offsetting the terrestrial carbon sink. However, the estimates found in the literature are subject to large uncertainties due to both missing data and methodological limitations. In particular, there is a gap of observations in the temperate climate zone, and data are especially scarce from eutrophic waters despite the fact that the emissions increase with the degree of eutrophication. We present data from a eutrophic reservoir in the temperate climate zone, measured continuously with a floating eddy-covariance system. Data from two seasons are analyzed, both starting and ending with spring and autumn mixing, respectively, and including the complete period of summer stratification. During the spring and summer months, clear diurnal patterns for the carbon dioxide fluxes were detected in the eddy covariance data reflecting the interplay between photosynthesis and respiration. However, this daylight driven oscillation weakened with the onset of autumn and disappeared at the end. In contrast to the carbon dioxide fluxes, the methane fluxes did not show any daytime dynamics. Notwithstanding, distinct seasonal patterns with increasing CH4 emissions over summer appeared. The carbon dioxide balance was about -9.8 and -71.0 g C m-2, in the first and second season, respectively. Thus, based on the eddy covariance measurements, the reservoir was a carbon dioxide sink in both study periods. However, the difference between the two seasons indicates a distinct inter-annual variability. The seasonal methane emissions were 24.0 g C m-2 and 23.2 g C m-2, respectively. Accordingly, the seasonal carbon budget resulted in 15.1 g C m-2 and -47.8 g C m-2, respectively, meaning the reservoir was a carbon source in the first and a sink in the second study period. However, considering the significant higher warming potential of methane and transposing these emissions into carbon dioxide equivalents, the reservoir contributed to the greenhouse potential of the atmosphere in both study periods.

Timing of Infections in the Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) by Schistocephalus solidus in Alaska	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												This study provides direct evidence for the timing of infections by Schistocephalus solidus in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) of south-central Alaska. Young-of-the-year fish in Cheney Lake were infected during their first summer within a few months after hatching in May-June. Infections appear to continue under ice cover on the lake during the subsequent fall and winter. Few, if any, 1-yr-old fish seemed to be infected for the first time, although 1-yr-old hosts with established parasites apparently acquired additional infections.

The effects of Oncorhynchus mykiss culture on the limnological conditions of Hanna Reservoir, Isfahan, Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												This study was conducted at the Hanna Reservoir located in the southwest of Isfahan Province. According to this study, chemical analyses were conducted to evaluate the magnitude and variations of COD, BOD5, O-2, NH3+ and NO2- concentrations in the Hanna Reservoir. In the headwaters the magnitude values of BOD5, COD and early morning oxygen minima were quite identical to the recommended optimum levels. However the concentrations of unionized ammonia in winter and spring and the concentration of nitrite in summer and autumn exceeded the allowable levels cited in different literature and might have exerted some growth retarding or lethal effects on the fish population. Water quality, zooplankton, benthos and sediments were monitored at sites of 20 m depths to determine the effects of rainbow trout cage culture on the lake environment. Oxygen depletion occurred in the vicinity of the farms due to respiration of the farmed fish. Zooplankton had stronger nutritional value in all six ecosystems of the Hanna Reservoir, and in seasons during which fish feed on these nutritional sources, breeding occurs with higher efficiency. Benthic invertebrates were rare at all six sites of the lake. The sediments below the cages had a pH and organic matter comparable to areas of the lake receiving the natural input of allochthonous material.																			1562-2916						2017	16	3					1085	1097																WOS:000408236700017

Our study sites are located in the High Arctic, on Svalbard, Norway in the Low Arctic at Abisko, Sweden, and at Toolik Lake, Alaska, USA and our temperate alpine site is at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, USA. These sites represent a range of tundra temperature and precipitation regimes, being generally cold and dry in the High Arctic and warmer and wetter at Toolik Lake and Niwot Ridge. Results from our studies indicate organismic attributes such as flowering shoot length varies by 30% between low and high arctic populations and that experimental warming results in significant increases in shoot height at three of four sites. We find that phenological development of Dryas is accelerated under experimentally warmed conditions which corresponds with a lengthening of the growing season in autumn, greater degrees of seed set and a higher likelihood of colonization of bare ground. We also observe that Dryas dominated ecosystems which are exposed to experimental manipulations are capable of exhibiting net carbon sequestration in late autumn, and that Dryas photosynthesis and green leaf biomass is significantly greater under warmer as opposed to ambient temperature conditions. Dryas leaf nitrogen is also significantly lowered under warmer conditions resulting in senescent leaves having a higher C:N ratio than those under ambient conditions. Together these findings indicate that Dryas phenology and carbon flux may be altered to the greatest degree in spring and again in autumn by higher summer temperatures and that simultaneously both positive and negative feedback effects may result from changes in plant and ecosystem performance.					; Wookey, Philip/AAA-6271-2020; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013	Wookey, Philip/0000-0001-5957-6424; 													1354-1013					DEC	1997	3			1			61	73		10.1111/j.1365-2486.1997.gcb143.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.1997.gcb143.x													WOS:000071285300007

Persistence of Daphnia in the epilimnion of Lake Mead, Arizona-Nevada, during extreme drought and expansion of invasive quagga mussels (2000-2009)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake Mead has experienced drought conditions since 2000 and the introduction of invasive quagga mussels since about 2004. Empirical evidence from the Great Lakes region suggests a potential for energy transfer to the benthos and away from planktivorous fish through competition between quagga mussels and filter-feeding, herbivorous zooplankton. We describe Daphnia dynamics from 2043 analyses performed on the 3 basins of subtropical Lake Mead during 2000-2009. Daphnia were generally most numerous in shallower areas strongly influenced by nutrient inputs and with decreased clarity and higher chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentrations. Daphnia populations increased in mid-to late winter and early spring prior to the spawning of gamefish populations and rapidly decreased with increasing predation pressure, water temperature and cyanobacteria populations. Concurrent with the reduction in Daphnia populations in late spring, quagga veliger abundance rapidly increased, declined in summer, and peaked again in the fall. Quagga veligers in Lake Mead were generally most numerous in open water areas with maximum depth, greater clarity and low chl-a. Although mean Daphnia abundance since the beginning of drought conditions and the establishment of quagga mussels is lower in Boulder Basin, the temporal and spatial dynamics of the zooplankton community remain comparable to previously described historic patterns in all 3 basins of Lake Mead.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2010	26	4					273	282		10.1080/07438141.2010.519858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2010.519858													WOS:000288117800006

To investigate the characteristics of DOM in Huangpu River (the last tributary of the Yangtze River), surface water samples were collected along the river from December 2011 to June, 2013. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the absorbance and fluorescence spectrum of DOM in water samples were measured. Fluorescent DOM in the Huangpu River was decomposed into four components by the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), including one humic-like substance and three protein-like substances. It showed that high spatial variability of DOC concentration was observed in the upstream water compared to the downstream water, and so did the absorbance coefficients of chromophoric dissolved organic matter and the total fluorescence intensities of different PARAFAC components of DOM. Furthermore, there was a large difference between the polarity and bioavailability of DOM in the Huangpu River. Polar compounds dominated tyrosine-like component of fluorescent DOM in all seasons. Tryptophan-like and humic-like substances had more polar fraction in summer and autumn than those in winter, while aromatic protein-like materials had the highest polar fraction in winter. Almost all of fluorescent DOM components were refractory in spring, while less than 20% of fluorescent DOM in average were biodegradable within 4 weeks in other seasons. We concluded that the spatial variation in the abundance of DOM in the Huangpu River is mainly affected by the water discharges from the Hangjiahu Plain and the seasonal difference in polarity and bioavailability of DOM is largely determined by its origins.

In Spain, these water bodies are particularly important and sensitive, so studying the impact of climate change critical for their long-term management and maintenance. This study aims to identify warming trends in these water bodies and determine whether they vary by season or geographical location by processing time series data of surface temperatures from Landsat 5 images to identify changes in the surface temperature of lakes and reservoirs between 1994 and 2011. This analysis revealed that 87% of water bodies exhibit a warming trend, with an average increase in water surface temperature of +0.037 degrees C per year. The Ebro and Guadalquivir depressions exhibited the highest temperature increases. However, temperature changes vary across the peninsula, generally associated with air surface temperatures, and are influenced by altitude in the mountain areas and Atlantic winds in the west depressions. The trends indicate a seasonal pattern: in summer, the number of water bodies with high temperatures increases, while in autumn there are more lakes and reservoirs with intermediate temperatures. In winter and spring, the number of water bodies with low temperatures decreases and they are located further north. The influence of factors such as climate and local conditions should be investigated to better understand the warming of these water bodies.

Diatoms abound in ice-covered Lake Erie: An investigation of offshore winter limnology in Lake Erie over the period 2007 to 2010	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The limnology of offshore Lake Erie during periods of extensive (>70%) ice cover was examined from ship borne sampling efforts in 2007 to 2010, inclusive. Dense and discrete accumulations of the centric filamentous diatom Aulacoseria islandica (>10 mu g Chl-a/L) were located in the isothermal (<1 degrees C) water column directly below the ice and only detectable in the ship wake; viable phytoplankton were also observed within ice. Evidence from these surveys supports the notions that winter blooms of diatoms occur annually prior to the onset of ice cover and that the phytoplankton from these blooms are maintained in the surface waters of Lake Erie and reduce silicate concentrations in the lake prior to spring. The mechanisms by which high phytoplankton biomass rise at this time of year requires further investigation, but these winter blooms probably have consequences for summer hypoxia and how the lake responds to climate change.

Distinct diel and seasonal behaviours in rainbow trout detected by fine-scale acoustic telemetry in a lake environment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The fine-scale behavioural activities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in nature are not well understood, but are of importance for identifying interactions with the ecosystem and of interest to conservationists and recreational anglers. We have undertaken a high-resolution acoustic telemetry study to identify the distinct movement patterns of 30 rainbow trout in a freshwater lake, specifically examining swim speed, area of movement, and site preference in both summer and winter. Activity levels were reduced in winter compared with summer across all fish, but ranking of individuals was consistent. In summer, 16/30 fish displayed diel movement, in which they travelled to a different area of the lake at dawn and returned at dusk, while other fish maintained their site preference regardless of the time of day or swam more randomly throughout the lake. These patterns were minimized in winter, where there was a reduction in cross-lake movement under ice and only 4/30 fish displayed diel movement. Winter conditions may limit the capability (physiological limitations) and (or) motivation (prey availability) for diel behaviours observed in summer.					; Biagi, Carlo/AAN-2030-2020	Blanchfield, Paul/0000-0003-0886-5642; Biagi, Carlo/0000-0002-6345-9674													0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	2019	76	8					1432	1445		10.1139/cjfas-2018-0293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0293													WOS:000477599400017
J	Hieber, M; Robinson, CT; Uehlinger, U				Hieber, M; Robinson, CT; Uehlinger, U			Seasonal and diel patterns of invertebrate drift in different alpine stream types	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined the seasonal and diel patterns of invertebrate drift in relation to seston and various habitat characteristics in two each of four different kinds of alpine streams [rhithral (snow-fed) lake outlets, rhithral streams, kryal (glacial-fed) lake outlets and kryal streams]. Samples were collected at four times of the day (dawn, midday, dusk and midnight) during three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). 2. Habitat characteristics differed mainly between rhithral and kryal sites, with the latter having higher discharge and turbidity, lower water temperature, and higher concentrations of ammonium, and particulate and soluble reactive phosphorus. Seasonality in habitat characteristics was most pronounced for kryal streams with autumn samples being more similar to rhithral sites. 3. The concentration of seston was lowest in the glacial-influenced lake outlets and slightly higher in the stream sites; no seasonal or diel patterns were evident. 4. The density of drifting invertebrates averaged less than 100 m(-3) and was lowest (<10 m(-3) ) at three of the four kryal sites. Taxon richness and diversity were lowest at rhithral lake outlets. Chironomidae dominated the drift as well as benthic communities and <30% of benthic taxa identified were found in the drift. 5. Drifting invertebrates showed no consistent seasonal pattern. However, density tended to be highest in spring at rhithral sites and in autumn at kryal sites. No diel periodicity in drift density was found at any site and the lack of diel pattern may be a general feature of high altitude streams. 6. Glacially influenced habitat parameters were a major factor affecting drift in these alpine streams, whereas no clear differences were observed between streams and lake outlets. Our findings indicate that invertebrate drift in alpine streams is primarily influenced by abiotic factors, and therefore, substantially differs from patterns observed at lower altitude.

Although the role of seasonality was emphasized previously, this aspect is rarely considered yet, and it remains elusive how this impacted hydroclimate during winters and summers across Central Europe. Here, we coupled biomarker-based delta 18O and delta 2H from Bergsee in southern Germany to reconstruct deuterium excess as a proxy for evaporation history from the B & oslash;lling-Aller & oslash;d to the Preboreal. We compared this dataset with other biomarker isotope records in Central Europe. They are all lacking a strong isotopic depletion during the Younger Dryas, which is best explained by the summer sensitivity of the biomarker proxies: As Younger Dryas summers were relatively warm, there is an absence of the strong winter cooling signals recorded in annual water isotope records like Greenland or Lake Stei ss lingen. Lake evaporation at Bergsee together with other paleohydrological reconstructions draw a coherent picture of the Late Glacial hydroclimate, with strong evidence for warm and dry Younger Dryas summers. Rather than a southward shift of the Westerlies during winter, we suggest that a recently proposed feedback mechanism between North Atlantic sea ice extend, strong winter cooling and summer atmospheric blocking serves as a suitable explanation for summer dryness. Additional confidence to the robustness of these biomarker records is provided by the overall agreement of paleohydrological fluctuations during the Preboreal.

Such potential carriers of leptospirosis as house mice (Mus musculus) and tamarisk gerbils (Meriones tamariscinus) are widely spread in this area, and the size of their population can amount to great numbers. The sharpest fluctuations in the population size are characteristic of house mice inhabiting the shores of water collecting ponds and lakes in the regions of minimally used pastures. A moderate number of house mice was registered in spring and autumn at the area of irrigated agriculture. Only here and only in autumn a faint epizootic manifestation of the natural focus of L. grippotyphosa infection in house mice was registered for the first time in Turkmenistan. The titers in mouse blood sera, determined in the microagglutination test and the Leptospira lysis test, were 1:20 to 1:200. According to the data on the humidity and pH of the soil in the vicinity of irrigated fields, spring and summer months may be regarded as the most favorable period for the survival of leptospires in the environment. The probability of the aggravation of the epizootic. situation seems to increase when irrigated fields adjoin pastures of are temporarily used as grazing ground for cattle.																			0372-9311	2686-7613				JUL	1991		7					42	45											1835231					WOS:A1991GJ56700014

The chemical species of PM(2.5)samples mainly focused on Organic carbon (OC), Elemental carbon (EC) and Water-Soluble Inorganic Ions (WSIIs). The annual average of PM(2.5)concentration was 59.8 +/- 31.7 mu g center dot m(-3), 1.7 times higher than the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standards (CNAAQS) (35 mu g center dot m(-3)). SNA (SO42-, NO(3)(-)and NH4+) was the most dominated species of PM(2.5)total WSIIs, accounting for 51% of PM2.5. PM(2.5)and all of its chemical species shared the same seasonal variations with higher concentration in winter and spring, lower in autumn and summer. The higher NO3-/EC and NOR occurred in winter suggested that intensive secondary formation of nitrate contributed to the higher levels of PM2.5. Cluster analysis based on 72-h backward air trajectory showed that the air mass cluster from nearby inland cities, including Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces contributed mostly to the total trajectories. Furtherly, potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis revealed that local sources, namely the emissions in the Yangtze River, were the primary sources. During haze pollution, NO(3)(-)was the most important fraction of PM(2.5)and the heterogeneous formation of nitrate became conspicuous. All the results suggested that the anthropogenic emissions (such as traffic exhaust) was responsible for the relatively high level of PM(2.5)at this monitoring station.																				2073-4433				AUG	2020	11	8							789	10.3390/atmos11080789	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11080789													WOS:000566423800001

This species exhibits an ontogenetic diet shift from zooplanktivory to piscivory as juveniles. An early switch to piscivory allows 0+ bass to increase their growth rate prior to winter, resulting in reduced mortality. However, little is known about the dietary switch at the population level during the first year. We used carbon stable isotope analyses to examine the diets of age 0+ individuals in Lake Izunuma, Japan. The onset of the shift to piscivory occurred at a smaller size than in native or other non-native areas [> 40 mm total length (TL)]. We found a positive correlation between TL and delta C-13 throughout summer and autumn. Small individuals had delta C-13 values that were similar to those of zooplankton, whereas large individuals had delta C-13 values that were similar to those of cyprinid prey species. This suggests that the smaller 0+ individuals remain zooplanktivorous until late autumn, whereas the larger individuals shift to piscivory as early as June, soon after the breeding season ends. Our results also suggest that a significant number of 0+ bass failed to switch to piscivory until the winter of their first year, despite the smaller size threshold for the onset of piscivory.

Relationship between standard metabolic rate and parasite-induced cataract of juveniles in three Atlantic salmon stocks	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The connection between standard metabolic rate (R-S) and parasite-induced cataract was investigated in this study. Oxygen consumption rate and cataract of 1 year-old fish in three Atlantic salmon Salmo salar stocks: Lake Saimaa, River Neva and River Teno reared at the same fish farm were examined. The measurements were carried out in winter, in spring before transporting the fish to the outside raceways and in autumn after the raceway period. Fish were exposed to natural Diplostomum spp. infection especially during the raceway period. The prevalence of cataract-bearing fish and cataract intensities (I-C) differed between the populations. Most cataract-bearing individuals were found in the Saimaa stock and, in addition, the Saimaa stock had higher I-C than Neva and Teno stocks. These findings support the theory of a parasite being most infective to local population. The R-S, however, differed also between the stocks, the Teno stock had higher values compared to the Neva stock in winter.

However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the relative importance of these factors on the effect of community composition and biomass of phytoplankton. The relative importance of the water quality physicochemical parameters (water temperature [WT], total nitrogen [TN], total phos-phorus [TP], pH, dissolved oxygen [DO], electrical conductivity [EC], turbidity and Secchi depth [SD]), land use (built-up land, farmland, waters, forest, grassland, and unused land) in the watershed, and lake mor-phology (area and depth) on the composition and biomass of phytoplankton communities were assessed in 29 subtropical shallow lakes in Wuhan, China, during different seasons from December 2017 to Novem-ber 2018. The results showed that phytoplankton in all 29 lakes was mainly composed of Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta. Phytoplankton abundance was highest in summer and lowest in winter. We analyzed the relative importance of the three groups of variables to the community composition of the phytoplankton by variance decomposition. The results showed that the three groups of environmental variables had the highest explanation rate (> 80%) for the composition of the phytoplankton community in summer and autumn, and the explanation rates in spring and winter were 42.1% and 39.8%, respec-tively. The water quality physicochemical parameters were the most important variables affecting the composition of phytoplankton communities, followed by land use in the watershed. Through generalized additive model and structural equation model analysis, we found that the land use and lake morphology had minimal direct impact on the Chl-a and cell density of phytoplankton, mainly by altering the TN, TP, turbidity, SD, DO, and EC, which indirectly affected phytoplankton. WT and nutrients were still the main predictors of phytoplankton abundance. Built-up land was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes. Correlation analysis found that forest and grassland had positive impacts on reducing lake nitro-gen and phosphorus contents. This showed that increasing grassland and forest in the watershed could reduce the pollutants entering the lake. Our findings will contribute to water quality management and pollution control for subtropical shallow lakes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The seasonal relationship between microbial diversity of bacteria and fungi and environmental factors was investigated in a large drinking-water reservoir using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Forty-one bacterial phyla and nine fungal phyla were analyzed in the Qingcaosha Reservoir, Shanghai, China. The predominant bacterial phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria, with the maximum relative abundance of 46%, 36.6%,16.1%, and 14.9%, respectively. Actinobacteria were observed to be the predominant bacterial phylum during spring and summer. The maximum relative abundance of unclassified fungi appeared in summer (98.8%), which was higher than that of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (11.7% and 8.2%, respectively). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) results showed that the structural similarity in the bacterial community was greater during summer and winter; however, the fungal community exhibited a greater similarity during spring and summer. 2-Methylisoborneol (2-MIB), an olfactory compound produced by microorganisms, was detected at a concentration of 8.97 ng/L during summer, which was slightly lower than the olfactory threshold (10 ng/L). The positive correlation between Actinobacteria and unclassified fungi and 2-MIB (p < 0.05) confirmed that Actinobacteria and unclassified fungi produced 2-MIB. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 1.48-1.94 mg/L, and the maximum concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were 2.1 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. Chloroflexi were negatively correlated with COD (p < 0.05) but positively correlated with TP (p < 0.01). Nitrospirae were negatively conflated with COD (p < 0.05), but positively correlated with TN (p < 0.05). Among the classified fungi, Rozellomycota, Basidiomycota (p < 0.05), and Chytridiomycota (p < 0.01) were positively correlated with TP. Therefore, the relative abundance of predominant bacteria was affected by various environmental factors; however, fungi were mainly influenced by TP. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

B	Zhang, JF	Zhang, J			Zhang, Jianfeng	Zhang, J		N and P Absorption by Hydrophytes and Wetland Sustainable Management	FORESTRY MEASURES FOR ECOLOGICALLY CONTROLLING NON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTION IN TAIHU LAKE WATERSHED, CHINA												The function of wetlands on non-point source pollution is clear; thus to conduct wetland sustainable management is significant. As typical wetland plants, the removal effect and height distribution of N and P of reed, cattail, and giant reed were determined in Yixing. Results showed that all these plants could reduce N and P concentrations in wetlands, and a "backflow" rule of nitrogen and phosphorus was observed in the plants. In spring and summer, the nitrogen and phosphorus contents were high, but these nitrogen and phosphorus returned to the lower part of the plants during autumn and winter. Therefore, this rule is important in wetland management, specifically for determining plant harvesting time. This study presents the wetland restoration and sustainable management mode, which not only can protect farmers' interests but also help promote wetland restoration work steady and orderly forward. Hence, the principle of "positive publicity, financial compensation, community participation, technology support, market leading, model advancing, and common management" can be used as guidelines of wetland restoration work for large-scale wetland restoration and construction in the overall Taihu Lake watershed.																					978-981-10-1850-3; 978-981-10-1849-7				2016							235	253		10.1007/978-981-10-1850-3_15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-1850-3_15	10.1007/978-981-10-1850-3												WOS:000717139200016

Poyang Lake is a seasonally dynamic lake with frequent low levels in spring and autumn, which may be triggered by the local catchment and Yangtze River. Based on two typical years, a hydrodynamic model combined with long term hydrological observations was applied to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of the local catchment and Yangtze River on spring and autumn low water levels in Poyang Lake. As a first attempt, this study explored the spatial differences of the two influences. Simulation results showed that the contributions of the catchment and the Yangtze River were approximately 70% and 30% in spring 1963, and 5% and 95% in autumn 2006, respectively. The area of catchment influence was mainly distributed in channels and southern floodplains, with relatively uniform water levels. The area impacted by the Yangtze River mainly spanned from the northern portion of the waterway to the central lake, with strong spatial variability. This study focused on two typical years; however, the results can be extended to explain common hydrological phenomena and improve future strategies of water resource management in this riverlake system.

Seasonal trends were modeled using least-squares linear and polynomial regressions, and interannual trends were investigated with a linear mixed-effects model and an augmented serially alternating design. Four of the six species exhibited significant seasonal trends. Walleye CPUE increased linearly, whereas walleye and cisco mean weight and northern pike CPUE decreased linearly from spring through fall. Cisco CPUE and yellow perch mean weight exhibited curvilinear relationships, decreasing from spring through summer and then increasing from summer through fall. Two species exhibited significant 15-year trends across Minnesota from 1983 to 1997: Walleyes experienced significant positive trends in both CPUE and mean weight, probably benefiting from more efficient stocking or warmer June temperatures, and black crappies experienced a significant decreasing trend in CPUE, possibly due to replacement by walleyes, loss of spawning habitat, or increased harvest by recreational anglers. Catches of ciscoes, northern pike, white suckers, and yellow perch in gill nets were unchanged across Minnesota between 1983 and 1997, indicating population stability. The results of this study suggest that lakes should be sampled with gill nets at the same time of year or that catches should be corrected to a common date to allow direct comparisons among lakes. The monitoring of trends in fish populations and habitat variables using standardized sampling on broad spatial scales should be more widely used to detect changes, generate hypotheses regarding these changes, and focus research and management efforts.					; Weisberg, Stephen/B-2477-2008	Weisberg, Sanford/0000-0002-1141-6699; 													0275-5947					MAY	2004	24	2					417	428		10.1577/M03-009.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-009.1													WOS:000222067500008

In this study, we present data on two waterbodies, one large (Nahuel Huapi), and one shallow (Verde). The phytoplankton community structure and dynamics or either lake were monitored for a year, in relation to the physical and chemical fluctuation, as well as the morphometry of the respective basins. In the large lake, the phytoplankton biomass was strongly dominated by diatoms (Aulacoseira granulata, Rhizosolenia eriensis and Cyclotella stelligera) and by dinoflagellates (Gymnodinium and Peridinium spp.). In the small lake, Verde, the dominant algae were Trachelomonas spp. and Cosmarium punctulatum, during the summer biomass maximum, and Rhodomonas lacustris, Chrysochromulina parva and Navicula spp. during autumn. The maximum biomass value was 634 mg m(-3) in Lake Nahuel Huapi in spring and 7800 mg m(-3) in Lake Verde in summer. According to their phytoplankton and physical and chemical features, Lakes Nahuel Huapi and Verde are readily classifiable, as ultra-oligotrophic and mesotrophic, respectively.																			0018-8158						1998	370						45	57		10.1023/A:1017046302728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017046302728													WOS:000076259900005

Contributions of different organic carbon sources to Daphnia in the pelagic foodweb of a small polyhumic lake:: Results from mesocosm DI13C-additions	ECOSYSTEMS												Freshwater ecosystems derive organic carbon from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources. We studied the relative contributions of different carbon sources to zooplankton in a small, polyhumic, steeply stratified lake, using six replicate surface-to-sediment enclosures established during summer and autumn 2004. We added C-13-enriched bicarbonate to the epilimnion of half the enclosures for three weeks during each season and monitored carbon stable isotope ratios of DIC, DOC, POC and Daphnia, along with physical, chemical and biological variables. During summer, C-13-enriched DIC (delta C-13 up to 44 +/- 7.2 parts per thousand) was soon taken up by phytoplankton (delta C-13 up to -5.1 +/- 13.6 parts per thousand) and was transmitted to Daphnia (delta C-13 up to -1.7 +/- 7.2 parts per thousand), demonstrating consumption of phytoplankton. In contrast, during autumn, C-13-enriched DIC (delta C-13 up to 56.3 +/- 9.8 parts per thousand) was not transmitted to Daphnia, whose delta C-13 became progressively lower (delta C-13 down to -45.6 +/- 3.3 parts per thousand) concomitant with decreasing methane concentration. Outputs from a model suggested phytoplankton contributed 64-84% of Daphnia diet during summer, whereas a calculated pelagic carbon mass balance indicated only 30-40% could have come from phytoplankton. Although autumn primary production was negligible, zooplankton biomass persisted at the summer level. The model suggested methanotrophic bacteria contributed 64-87% of Daphnia diet during autumn, although the calculated carbon mass balance indicated a contribution of 37-112%. Thus methanotrophic bacteria could supply virtually all the carbon requirement of Daphnia during autumn in this lake. The strongly C-13-depleted Daphnia values, together with the outputs from the models and the calculated carbon mass balance showed that methanotrophic bacteria can be a greater carbon source for Daphnia in lakes than previously suspected.

In this study, we examine the seasonal pattern of sex hormone concentration in juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) and make a limited comparison of these seasonal patterns on two different lakes in Florida. Male juvenile alligators from a reference lake, Lake Woodruff, displayed temporal patterns in plasma testosterone (T) concentrations that appear to be seasonal. A similar pattern in plasma estradiol-17beta (E-2) was observed in juvenile females from Lake Woodruff. Males had significantly elevated T concentrations during the spring and late summer, whereas females had elevated E-2 in the spring and late summer and significantly depressed E-2 concentrations during the winter. A limited 4-month survey of animals from contaminated Lake Apopka found a lack of such seasonality. These results suggest that: (1) healthy wild populations of juvenile alligators have a prolonged peripubescent period that is marked by seasonal hormonal cycles, (2) juvenile alligators exposed to environmental contaminants can lack such seasonal cyclicity, and (3) future studies of juvenile alligators should incorporate such seasonality into the experimental design.

Infestation levels are low (< 5%) in the early summer, when the new adult generation appears in the plankton, and increase through the autumn and winter, reaching 100% by March or April. Immature L. macrurus copepodites and the copepodites of more abundant co-occurring species do not appear to be infested by the suctorian. T. quadripartita was previously described from European and North American ponds and marshes in association with peritrichs on snails, beetle larvae and turtles.

Indoor and outdoor air concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and novel flame retardants (NFRs) were determined at 17-20 homes in Czech Republic in winter and summer. Indoor concentrations were consistently higher than outdoor concentrations for all compounds; indoor/outdoor ratios ranged from 2-20, with larger differences for the current use NFRs than for legacy PCBs. Seasonal trends differed according to the use status of the compounds: the PCBs had higher summer concentrations both indoors and outdoors, suggesting volatilization as a source of PCBs to air. PBDEs had no seasonal trends indoors, but higher summer concentrations outdoors. Several NFRs (TBX, PBT, PBEB) had higher indoor concentrations in winter relative to summer. The seasonal trends in the flame retardants suggest differences in air exchange rates due to lower building ventilation in winter could be driving the concentration differences. Weak relationships were found with building age for PCBs, with higher concentrations indoors in buildings built before 1984, and with the number of electronics for PBDEs, with higher concentrations in rooms with three or more electronic items. Indoor environments are the primary contributor to human inhalation exposure to these SVOCs, due to the high percentage of time spent indoors (>90%) combined with the higher indoors levels for all the studied compounds. Exposure via the indoor environment contributed similar to 96% of the total chronic daily intake via inhalation in summer and similar to 98% in winter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The phytoplankton biomass presented a marked seasonality, accompanied by similar seasonal patterns in temperature and zooplankton dynamics. Community variations were reflected in the diversity, dominance and equitability values. The greatest change was associated during a short flooding period produced in late spring. The wind exposure was irregular during the whole study period, and was assumed to be a factor of stress for the phytoplankton growth. During spring and early summer, the phytoplankton community was dominated by nanoplanktonic forms like Rhodomonas lacustris, and the large sized Asterionella formosa presented an exponential increment at late summer. This Asterionella growth permitted to affirm that the community evolved towards plagioclimatic stages, attending the highly disturbed conditions of the shallow and wind exposed environment.																			0020-9309						1997	82	2					147	160		10.1002/iroh.19970820203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19970820203													WOS:A1997XK40000002

Phytoplankton communities, as well as the seasonal changes in the Ashi River Basin (ASRB) of Heilongjiang Province were investigated from April 2018 to January 2019. A survey in April (spring), July (summer), October (autumn), and January (winter) at 16 sampling sites was conducted. The composition, abundance, and biodiversity indices of phytoplankton were studied and 127 taxa of phytoplankton were identified. Among them, Bacillariophyta dominated the phytoplankton communities in the whole year. There were significant spatio-temporal changes in the structures of the phytoplankton communities during the study period. Trophic state index (TSI) show that the nutritional status of the ASRB was at mesotrophic-middle eutrophic levels. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that total nitrogen (TN), water temperature (WT), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the critical factors in the dynamic phytoplankton community structure. The multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis showed that Chlamydomonas microsphaerella Pascher et Jahoda, Melosira granulata (Ehrenberg) Ralfs, Merismopedia tenuissima Lemmermann, and Asterionella formosa Hassall were valuable indicators in the determination of water quality in ASRB.

Application of telemetry-based fish habitat models to predict spatial habitat availability and inform ecological restoration	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Conservation decisions surrounding which fish habitats managers choose to protect and restore are informed by fish habitat models. As acoustic telemetry has allowed for improvements in our ability to directly measure fish positions year-round, so too have there been opportunities to refine and apply fish habitat models. In an area with considerable anthropogenic disturbance, Hamilton Harbour in the Laurentian Great Lakes, we used telemetry-based fish habitat models to identify key habitat variables, compare habitat associations among seasons, and spatially identify the presence distribution of six fish species. Using environmental data and telemetry-based presence-absence from 2016 to 2022, random forest models were developed for each species across seasons. Habitat variables with the highest relative importance across species included fetch, water depth, and percentage cover of submerged aquatic vegetation. The presence probability of each species was spatially predicted for each season within Hamilton Harbour. Generally, species showed a spatial range expansion with greater presence probability in the fall and winter to include parts of the harbor further offshore, and a range contraction in the spring and summer toward the nearshore, sheltered areas, with summer having the most limited habitat availability. Greater habitat suitability was predicted in western Hamilton Harbour for the majority of species, whereas the east end was less suitable and may benefit from habitat restoration.

Oomycete communities derived from internal transcribed spacer clone libraries were clearly differentiated according to substrate and seasonal influences. In fresh leaves, diverse communities consisting of P. phragmitis and other reed-associated pathogens were generally dominant. Pythium phragmitis populations peaked in spring with the emergence of young reed shoots, and in autumn after extreme flooding events. In summer it decreased with falling water levels, changing water chemistry and rising temperatures. Another Pythium species was also highly abundant in fresh leaves throughout the year and might represent a new, as-yet uncultured reed pathogen. In dried leaves, reed pathogens were rarely detected, whereas saprophytic species occurred abundantly during all seasons. Saprophyte communities were less diverse, less temperature sensitive and independent of reed development. In general, our results provide evidence for the occurrence of highly specialized sets of reed-associated oomycetes in a natural reed ecosystem. Quantitative analyses (clone abundances and quantitative real-time PCR) revealed that the reed pathogen P. phragmitis is particularly affected by changing water levels, water chemistry and the stage of reed development.

Long-term and recent changes in southern Lake Michigan water quality with implications for present trophic status	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Southern Lake Michigan has changed in response to alterations in nutrients and invasive species. NOAA and EPA monitoring results are used to examine those changes. NOAA provides detailed seasonal resolution, but limited spatial coverage, whereas the EPA provides more spatial coverage, but limited seasonal resolution. We compare changes in total phosphorus (TP), silica, nitrate plus nitrite, and chlorophyll concentrations from before and after the invasion by the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). Although TP at NOAA stations was consistently higher than at EPA stations, both confirm declines in spring and summer surface mixed layer (SML) conditions. Chlorophyll differed at EPA and NOAA stations before quagga mussel invasion, but not after the invasion. Spring chlorophyll decreased at NOAA stations after the invasion, but summer conditions did not change at either set of stations. Pre-invasion silica at NOAA stations was slightly higher than at EPA stations, and the lake's Si reservoir increased over the study period. Basin-scale spring Si increased gradually, whereas summer SML Si increased dramatically after 2003, likely reflecting reduced diatom production. Basin-scale nitrate increased significantly from pre- to post-invasion in both spring and summer. Summer nitrate utilization declined drastically in recent years, likely reflecting reduced phytoplankton production. TP loads decreased; however, the timing of changes in chlorophyll and Si and nitrate utilization suggest the recent increase in dreissenid filtering dramatically reduced spring phytoplankton abundance and production across the entire southern basin. The offshore pelagic zone of the historically mesotrophic southern Lake Michigan is now similar to oligotrophic lake Superior. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal Patterns of Phytoplankton Taxon Richness in Lakes: Effects of Temperature, Turnover and Abundance	PROTIST												Species richness is a key ecological characteristic that influences numerous ecosystem functions. Here we analyse the patterns and possible causes of phytoplankton taxon richness in sea-sonal datasets from twenty contrasting lakes in the English Lake District over six years and near-weekly datasets over 33 years from Windermere. Taxon richness was lowest in winter and highest in summer or autumn in all of the lakes. Observed richness was very similar to richness estimated from coverage and sampling effort, implying that it closely reflected true seasonal patterns. Summer populations were dominated by Chlorophyta and functional groups X1, F, N and P (sensu Reynolds). In Windermere, weekly taxon richness was strongly positively correlated with surface water tempera -ture, as was the number of functional groups and the number of taxa per functional group. Turnover in richness of taxa and functional groups were positively correlated and both were related to surface temperature. This suggests that high taxon richness in summer is linked to higher water temperature, promoting a turnover in richness of taxa and functional groups in these lakes. However, since the number of taxa per unit concentration of chlorophyll a decreased with increasing concentration of chlorophyll a, competition might occur when abundance is high.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Temporal patterns of greenhouse gas emissions from two small thermokarst lakes in Nunavik, Canada	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Small thermokarst lakes, formed by the thawing of ice-rich permafrost, are significant sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Most estimates of emissions rely solely on daily measurements, which may bias annual flux calculations. In this study, we combined GHG flux measurements from two intensive summer campaigns with nearly 2 years of continuous temperature, oxygen and conductivity profiling in two small (< 200 m(2)) thermokarst lakes in Nunavik (56 degrees 33(')28.8('') N, 76 degrees 28(')46.5('') W), Canada. One campaign occurred during a colder period (8.8 degrees C average temperature) and the other during a warmer one (14.6 degrees C average temperature), with one lake being humic and sheltered and the other more transparent and wind-exposed. Average diffusive fluxes of CO2 (22.1 +/- 20.5 mmol m(-2)d(-1); mean +/- standard deviation) and CH4 (14.3 +/- 14.2 mmol CO2-eq m(-2)d(-1)) were consistent with values reported for similar thermokarst lakes, while N2O fluxes were negligible (-0.8 +/- 1.3 mmol CO2-eq m(-2)d(-1)). Emissions increased fourfold during the warmer summer, alongside the emergence of a diel trend, where daytime (09:00-17:00 EST) CO2 fluxes increased by 47 %, CH4 by 95 %, and negative N2O fluxes by 75 % relative to nighttime fluxes. Moreover, ebullitive CH4 fluxes were six times higher than diffusive fluxes in the humic, sheltered lake, reaching 117.0 +/- 44.7 mmol CO2-eq m(-2)d(-1). Seasonal flux estimates indicate that emissions could peak in autumn and spring, as the lakes accumulated large concentrations of GHG at the bottom. Our findings highlight the importance of including both daytime and nighttime measurements, as well as storage fluxes (emitted in spring and autumn), to improve the accuracy of GHG emission estimates from thermokarst lakes.																			1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 10	2025	22	19					5413	5433		10.5194/bg-22-5413-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-22-5413-2025													WOS:001590561600001

WATER												The aim of this study was to describe liver alterations observed in a bullhead (Cottus gobio) population from a high-mountain lake (Dimon Lake; 1857 m a.s.l.) located in Carnic Alps (Northeast Italy). Two fish sampling campaigns (summer and autumn) were performed in 2017 to explore the possible causes of this phenomenon. In addition, to investigate the typical liver features of C. gobio, control specimens were captured from Degano Creek in the same seasons. Total length, weight, and liver weight were recorded in fish from both sampling sites. In addition, Fulton's condition factor (K) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) were calculated. Stomach contents were also analyzed. Liver from each specimen was sampled, and histological examination was carried out. Liver steatosis (L) (nuclear displacement and cytoplasm vacuolization) were histologically evaluated by assigning a semiquantitative severity score. A significant difference in L was found between Dimon Lake and Degano Creek in both summer (Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.0001) and autumn (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.0001). Regarding HSI, a significant difference was also recorded between Dimon Lake and Degano Creek in summer (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.0001) and also in autumn (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.0001), but no seasonal change in K values was recorded between the two sites in both summer (Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.8589) and autumn (Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.6415). A significant positive correlation between HSI and L was found (rho S 0.573). The causes of this abnormality might be related to adaptation by the fish to the high-altitude environment, accumulating lipids in the liver to tackle the adverse season, which lasts for 6 months of the year. Nonetheless, our study does not preclude steatosis induced by a nearly exclusive chironomids diet in bullhead from Dimon Lake.					francese, danila/O-7222-2019; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019; menconi, Vasco/ABH-1632-2020; Mugetti, Davide/AAM-2277-2021	Varello, Katia/0000-0002-0486-2121; Prearo, Marino/0000-0002-2847-6006; Mugetti, Davide/0000-0002-4666-6823; Bertoli, Marco/0000-0001-8345-6107; menconi, Vasco/0000-0003-1176-6995; PIZZUL, ELISABETTA/0000-0001-9916-5005; Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168														2073-4441				DEC	2019	11	12							2570	10.3390/w11122570	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11122570													WOS:000507378600143

Small mammal dynamics in snow-covered forests	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												In seasonal environments, the winter months can drive the structure and dynamics of vertebrate communities. Most ecological studies have focused on species above the snow, overlooking those within the subnivium (below-snow environment). The Great Lakes region of North America is characterized by seasonal snow cover and a diverse assemblage of small mammals, both of which are changing rapidly in response to a changing climate. To study the seasonal dynamics of small mammals, we sampled communities in three forest types (hardwood, hemlock-cedar, and spruce bog) in summer and winter over 2 years. We hypothesized that seasonal differences in communities would be moderated by forest structure in summer and snow in winter. We assessed community dominance via species diversity and the abundances of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), white-footed mice (P. leucopus), and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We estimated a Community Temperature Index (CTI; a metric of the balance between warm- and cold-adapted species in a community) and tested seasonal drivers of CTI. Species diversity was highest in spruce bogs in winter due to increased species evenness, but diversity was consistent year-round in hardwood and hemlock-cedar forests due to unchanging species dominance. Spruce bogs supported the coldest CTI in summer, but CTIs converged across forest types in winter. In summer, forest structure drove CTI; in winter, colder CTIs were associated with deeper snow and a warmer subnivium. Our work reveals that snow is a critical habitat and filter for cold-adapted species that ultimately structures small mammal communities. Given rapid changes in snow conditions due to climate change, we predict continued range contractions for subnivium-adapted species.

This study examined the phytoplankton community structure and environmental factors of saline a lake during spring, summer, and autumn in 2019. A total of 95 phytoplankton species (belonging to 47 genera and 7 phyla) were identified in Ebinur Lake, reflecting a species richness lower than those of freshwater lakes while being greater than the levels observed in other saltwater lakes. Bacillariophyta dominated the phytoplankton assemblage, followed by Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, with lesser diversity in other algal species, suggesting that the species composition was similar to that observed in other saltwater lakes. There was considerable spatiotemporal variation in the structure of the phytoplankton community, with the biomass of phytoplankton displaying notable seasonal variation. In spring, the biomass of Bacillariophyta was dominant; in summer, as the climate warmed, the biomass of phytoplankton reached its peak and the biomass of Chlorophyta was dominant; in autumn, the biomass was the lowest, and Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta shared dominance. The spatial distribution was relatively consistent, as reflected in the distribution of phytoplankton in the three seasons, with the southeastern area of the lake generally exhibiting higher biomass than other lake areas. Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta were significantly correlated with water transparency (SD); Cyanophyta was significantly correlated with water temperature (WT), and Cryptophyta was significantly correlated with pH. The interaction effects of various environmental factors, including pH, SD, Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and salinity (S), jointly affect the dynamics of the phytoplankton community structure in Ebinur Lake. This study investigated the effects of physicochemical factors on the structure of the phytoplankton community in a high salinity lake, thereby providing a basis for ecological protection and environmental management of aquatic ecosystems in extreme environments.																			2045-7758					JUN	2025	15	6							e71516	10.1002/ece3.71516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71516								40519891					WOS:001507849100001

Five of the specimens had empty stomachs. A total of 29 prey taxa belonging to eight major groups comprising aquatic insects, Copepoda, Cladocera, Rotifera, Bacillariopyhta, Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria and fish eggs were identified in 150 full stomachs. Diet composition showed slight seasonal variation. Cladocera was the most important prey item in all seasons, with peak abndance in spring. Feeding intensity exhibited seasonal change and was maximum in summer. Summer and autumn diets of this species showed the highest similarity. The study indicated that the Prussian carp in Lake Ladik showed both omnivorous and opportunistic feeding habits, exhibiting specialised feeding strategy on Cladocera, while they showed generalised feeding strategy on most prey items. The wide dietary plasticity of invasive Prussian carp can help their population to expand rapidly in different aquatic ecosystems.

J	TONN, WM; MAGNUSON, JJ				TONN, WM; MAGNUSON, JJ			PATTERNS IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION AND RICHNESS OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN NORTHERN WISCONSIN LAKES	ECOLOGY												Fish assemblage structure, factors and mechanisms appearing important in the ecological maintenance of these structures, were examined for 18 small lakes in northern Wisconsin during summer and winter. The study was focused around the following questions. Are there discrete, repeatable groups of fish assemblages? If so, are they temporally stable? What are the relations between fish assemblage structure and habitat complexity, physical disturbance, biotic interactions and the insular nature of small lakes? A comparative approach was used to generate hypotheses and propose explanations concerning the roles of these factors in structuring the assemblages. Multivariate classification, ordination and discriminant analyses helped discern 2 assemblage types: Umbra-cyprinid and centrarchid-Esox. Each had a distinctive species composition and seasonal change in composition. Environmental characteristics of the lakes occupied by each assemblage type also differed consistently. The type of assemblage present in a lake appeared related to O2 concentration in winter, interacting with the availability of refuges from either a severe physical environment (low O2 during winter) or from large piscivores. Centrarchid-Esox assemblages occurred in lakes with high winter O2 levels and also in lakes with low O2 levels if a stream or connecting lake could provide a refuge from these conditions in winter. When no refuge was present, low winter O2 lakes lacked piscivorous fishes but contained Umbra-cyprinid assemblages. The relationships between species richness in summer and environmental factors were generally similar for the 2 assemblage types, but the relative importance of individual factors differed. In winter, richness relationships in centrarchid-Esox assemblages for most environmental factors were reversed from those of summer. No significant seasonal change occurred in the Umbra-cyprinid assemblages. Habitat complexity factors, particularly vegetation diversity, were significantly related to summer species richness in both assemblage types. Lake area was also related to summer richness for both types, but the slope of the species-area regression was much steeper for Umbra-cyprinid assemblages than for those in centrarchid-Esox lakes. Species richness relationships with winter O2 concentration were negative in both seasons in Umbra-cyprinid lakes, but the relationship was positive for centrarchid-Esox assemblages in winter. A measure of lake connectedness was related to summer richness in centrarchid-Esox lakes. Centrarchid-Esox assemblages are in ecological equilibrium but that a disturbance-induced disequilibrium occurs in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.

A system of two large lakes, their drainage basins, and tributaries is seen to be a major factor responsible for these conditions. Measurements made at Burwash Bay, where the Amadjuak River enters Nettilling Lake, provide the basis for heat budget estimates in the summer period. An average daily heat input of 22 MJ m-2 d-1 to the surface of the bay results in a late-season average temperature of the water column that is close to the average daily air temperature for July, which was 11.degree. C in 1985 and 9.degree. C in 1986. It is concluded that this heat reservoir acts to maintain locally moderate temperatures during times of cold air intrusion in summer and to retard the seasonal cooling in fall and early winter.																			0004-0851					MAY	1988	20	2					212	219		10.2307/1551499	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551499													WOS:A1988N832000006

However, the mechanisms by which different nutrient levels affect seasonal nitrogen variations in the water columns are not clear, especially for long-term and large- scale studies. In this study, we used 206 independent spatial samples from a total of 108 subtropical shallow lakes from four surveys in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as timecase study data from Lake Taihu and Lake Donghu of up to 23 and 14 years, respectively, to analyze the changes in summer TN compared to spring (delta TN). Delta TN was significantly negatively correlated with initial spring TN concentrations, with similar trends observed in both space and time. Furthermore, the slopes of spring TN vs. delta TN varied little across lakes in both time and space, suggesting a consistent relationship between initial spring TN and summer TN changes. When initial TN or TN: TP ratio was low, N fixation by algae played a significant role in compensating for summer N removal, thus mitigating summer N reductions; when TN was high or TN: TP ratio was high, ammonia stress reduced the compensatory effect of algae and denitrification played a significant role in summer N removal, thus increasing summer N reductions. Our study suggested that no matter what the initial conditions are, lakes tend to evolve towards a common nutrient status through biological regulation.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023	Li, Yun/0000-0003-3655-2475													0043-1354	1879-2448				NOV 15	2024	266								122321	10.1016/j.watres.2024.122321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.122321		AUG 2024						39217645					WOS:001312219200001

Recent records of the GLOF events in the 1990s has indicated that the lake volume and peak discharge are becoming larger and larger corresponding to a warming and wetting of the inner Asian continent. Two extraordinary events of GLOF in summer 1994 and winter 1996 are investigated and described. There is evidence of a change in the magnitude and frequency of floods and in the extension of the glacier and the lake systems. A possible change of the GLOF for next 50 years is predicted by reviewing the history of GLOF events combined with water and heat indices of the current climate. The maximum peak discharge and the flood volume will be enlarged by 50% and 20% respectively, and the date of GLOF occurrence will be shifted to early summer and/or winter. The spring flow will be enlarged due to base flow originating from meltwater.																			0144-7815		1-901502-85-6				1999		255					99	107																WOS:000085484300012

Our assessment of summer movements was comprehensive, as locations were obtained during prenesting, nesting, and molt for over 90% of geese with active radios captured during winter or the previous summer in Alaska. Geese arrived to coastal and interior marshes in the Cook Inlet Basin (CIB) from mid April to early May, after which they moved to nesting areas in the upper CIB. Nesting birds used coastal staging areas in close proximity to eventual nest site location. Molting sites included a sub-glacial lake system in the upper CIB, although up to 50% of geese underwent a molt migration to wetlands across the Alaska Range, 400-600 km west of the CIB. Geese that melted at distant sites returned to the CIB before autumn migration. Length of stay in the CIB varied among years from 108-119 days, and averaged 116 days. Summer home-range sizes, exclusive of molting areas, averaged >273,000 ha, and were substantially larger than reported for other northern-nesting waterfowl. No radio-marked geese were found nesting in the vicinity of Redoubt Bay oil the west side of Cook Inlet, and few nested near the Susitna Flats, the only other previously known nesting areas. The absence of nesting geese from Redoubt Bay corroborates aerial survey data showing a precipitous decline in the use of the west side of Cook Inlet between the early 1980s and early 1990s. The change in distribution of geese is likely related to a major eruption of Redoubt Volcano in 1989 that significantly altered landscapes used by nesting, brood rearing, and molting geese in the vicinity of Redoubt Bay. High inter-site movements of Greater White-fronted Geese throughout, summer in South central Alaska likely increases exposure to predation, but also promotes social interactions and facilitates pioneering of distant, and diverse habitats in a vast, patchy, and often unpredictable landscape.

Overwintering Locations, Migrations, and Fidelity of Radio-Tagged Dolly Varden in the Hulahula River, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 2007-09	ARCTIC												Essential overwintering habitats for anadromous Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma on Alaska's North Slope appear to tie limited to a small number of perennial springs, primarily in eastern Brooks Range drainages. Because future petrochemical development in the region continues to be a possibility, and development would require large quantities of freshwater, we sought to identify and document the overwintering areas used by Dolly Varden in the Hulahula River, eastern Brooks Range. In August 2007, we implanted 52 Dolly Varden with multi-year radio transmitters at a known overwintering area in the lower Hulahula River. Other wintering areas were located during 11 aerial surveys conducted over the next 2.5 years. A stationary receiver located in the lower Hulahula River provided migration timing information. Radio-tagged Dolly Varden used four discrete areas with perennial springs for overwintering in the Hulahula River drainage. The springs, totaling approximately 12 km in stream length, were located between river km 40 and 105. Radio-tagged Dolly Varden migrated downstream on their way to the Beaufort Sea in early June. Most tagged fish known to have survived the summer at sea returned to the Hulahula River during late July and August, but seven fish overwintered in other North Slope drainages. Within the Hulahula River drainage, 15 fish overwintered in more than one area during the three winters of the project, but only the four identified perennial spring areas were used. These data clearly indicate that the perennial springs in the Hulahula River are essential overwintering habitats for Dolly Varden.

J	Mendes, MP; Cupe-Flores, B; Liber, K				Mendes, Maira P.; Cupe-Flores, Beatriz; Liber, Karsten			Sampling method and season influence selenium dynamics at the base of a boreal lake food chain	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Few studies have investigated the potential influence of sampling method and season on Se bioaccumulation at the base of the aquatic food chain. In particular, the effects of low water temperature associated with prolonged ice-cover periods on Se uptake by periphyton and further transfer to benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI) have been overlooked. Such information is crucial to help improve Se modelling and risk assessment at sites receiving continuous Se inputs. To date, this seems to be the first study to address these research questions. Here, we examined potential differences related to sampling methods (artificial substrates vs. grab samples) and seasons (summer vs. winter) on Se dynamics in the benthic food chain of a boreal lake (McClean Lake) receiving continuous low-level Se input from a Saskatchewan uranium milling operation. During summer 2019, water, sediment grab samples and artificial substrates were sampled from 8 sites with varying mill-treated effluent exposure. In winter 2021, water and sediment grab samples were sampled at 4 locations in McClean Lake. Water, sediment, and biological samples were subsequently analyzed for total Se concentrations. Enrichment functions (EF) in periphyton and trophic transfer factors (TTF) in BMI were calculated for both sampling methods and seasons. Periphyton collected with artificial substrates (Hester-Dendy samplers and glass plates) exhibited significantly higher mean Se concentrations (2.4 & PLUSMN; 1.5 & mu;g/g d.w) than periphyton collected from the surface of sediment grab samples (1.1 & PLUSMN; 1.3 & mu;g/g d.w). Selenium concentrations in periphyton sampled in winter (3.5 & PLUSMN; 1.0 & mu;g/g d.w) were significantly greater than summer (1.1 & PLUSMN; 1.3 & mu;g/g d.w). Nevertheless, Se bioaccumulation in BMI was similar between seasons, possibly suggesting that invertebrates are not actively feeding in winter. Further investigations are necessary to verify if peak Se bioaccumulation in BMI takes place in spring, coinciding with the reproductive and developmental windows of some fish species.

J	Buric, M; Kozák, P; Kouba, A				Buric, Milos; Kozak, Pavel; Kouba, Antonin			Movement patterns and ranging behavior of the invasive spiny-cheek crayfish in a small reservoir tributary	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Nineteen adult O. limosus (carapace length 26.3-35.7 mm) were radio-tagged and tracked in a small tributary to a reservoir during two time periods, from May to June and from October to November 2007. High nocturnal activity (33.3 %) and relatively high diurnal activity (18.2 %) were observed, with a positive effect of cloudy weather on nocturnal movements. Tracked crayfish showed a high ability for rapid upstream (62 m) and downstream (69 m) movements during short (3 h) time periods. The average movement distances per day were one order of magnitude lower (7.2 and 6.7 m in spring, autumn, respectively). The maximum daily movement was 139 m. A significant trend to downstream migration to the reservoir was observed in autumn. Fifteen specimens displayed homing behavior, with the use of a system of shelters. A preference for soft bottomed, deeper areas of the brook. and for slow flow areas, such as pools, with the presence of organic matter was observed. Fluctuations in crayfish density, together with downstream migration in autumn, suggested that crayfish inhabit the brook only during the growing season, over-wintering in the reservoir. This study provides information on the spatial and temporal behavior of invasive species in small tributaries suitable for indigenous crayfish and illustrates their serious threat for it.

Between 1998 and 2001, wing clipped sentinel birds (wild American coots and game farm mallards [Anas platyrhynchos]) were released at Lake Surf, North Carolina, a lake with recurrent outbreaks of AVM, in order to gain a better understanding of the epizootiology of the disease. As early as 5-7 days post-release, sentinel coots and mallards showed neurologic signs of disease and were confirmed with AVM upon histologic examination of their brains. Serial releases of sentinel mallards during the summer, fall, and winter of 2000-01 demonstrated that exposure to the causative agent at a threshold sufficient to manifest disease was seasonal and occurred over about a 2 mo period, during November and December. Our findings that disease onset can be very rapid (5-7 days) and that exposure to the causative agent of AVM is site-specific, seasonal (late fall to early winter), and occurs over a relatively short duration (several months) supports the hypothesis that the disease is caused by a chemical substance, most likely of natural origin.

The lack of consensus about the role of climate in controlling the DOC trends highlights the need for understanding the regulation of surface water DOC. We found that longer and colder winters result in higher [DOC] in a boreal headwater stream during the subsequent snowmelt. In addition, prolonged soil frost increases the spring and summer [DOC] in the riparian soil water, which is a major contributor of stream water DOC in the studied area. We conclude that winter climatic conditions can play a substantial role in controlling stream [DOC] in ways not previously understood. These findings are especially important for northern latitude regions expected to be most affected by climate change. Citation: Haei, M., M. G. Oquist, I. Buffam, A. angstrom gren, P. Blomkvist, K.

J	Poshtegal, MK; Mirbagheri, SA				Poshtegal, Maryam Khalilzadeh; Mirbagheri, Seyed Ahmad			The Heavy Metals Pollution Index and Water Quality Monitoring of the Zarrineh River, Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Water pollution is the most important reason to monitor and assess water quality. The chemical, physical, and biological quality of natural waters may be affected by anthropogenic activities such as industrial, urban, and agricultural activities. In the present study, the water quality of the Zarrineh River, one of the main rivers supplying water in the northwest of Iran, was investigated. A total of 21 sites were selected for surface water sampling during spring and winter (dry and wet) seasons. The concentrations of the metals aluminum, iron, barium, chromium, arsenic, copper, manganese, nickel, selenium, lead, and zinc were determined for source partition and heavy metal pollution index (HMPI) assessment during both the spring and winter seasons. Four important dominant factors in the principal component analysis depicted, in toto, 76.22 percent of the variance, with an initial eigenvalue greater than 1. The calculated HMPI for all the seasons and sampling stations was 66, fluctuating between 30 and 170 in single water sampling sites. The results showed that almost all locations fall into the high classes of the HMPI, but below the critical pollution index limit of 100. Apart from the gold mining establishments and industrial factories, the reasons for the increased concentrations of metals in the Zarrineh River may be attributed in particular to anthropogenic and mining activities.																			1078-7275	1558-9161				MAY	2019	25	2					179	188		10.2113/EEG-1996	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/EEG-1996													WOS:000465997700007

Density of Artemia was highest over 238.5 ha of the 1782 ha in 13 ponds, averaging 0.55 m deep, which form the final stages in salt concentration. Artemia and hydrological samples were taken twice a month on 23 occasions from April 1981 to April 1982 inclusive, and on each occasion, 86 sample stations over four ponds were sampled in triplicate. An unbiased estimate of biomass using the arithmetic mean was developed, together with confidence interval estimates based on the bootstrap method giving 95% confidence bound estimates within 25% of the estimated total Artemia biomass in each sampled pond. Artemia biomass concentrations within 50 m of the pond edges were, on average, 2.5 times those at the pond centre, and the biomass estimation procedure was thus accordingly stratified. Generally, Artemia were contagiously distributed with the edge stratum biomass having a long-normal distribution at each sampling time. Biomass was highest during late spring and summer, and lowest in late autumn through winter. Maximum estimated total biomass over 238.5 ha was 12,000 kg dry weight during January 1982.

These stacked sieves were used in concert with standard zooplankton tows to examine the MeHg distribution, with respect to particle size, zooplankton species and season, in eutrophic Green Bay (Lake Michigan) and oligotrophic Whitefish Bay (Lake Superior). The two sites, sampled during spring (May), summer (July), and fall (October) of 1998 differed in both the size distribution of methylmercury and in the seasonal pattern of concentrations and size distributions. In Green Bay, where suspended particulate mass is 5 to 15 times higher than Whitefish Bay, significant mass of methylmercury was found in size fractions greater than 35 mum, particularly in the summer, when larger phytoplankton were present. In Whitefish Bay, on the other hand, suspended particulate mass is low, and particulate methylmercury was found almost exclusively in the < 35 mum size fraction with the seasonal peak in the spring.

To evaluate the phytoplankton characteristics and eutrophication status in Shihoudian Lake, we investigated the community structure of phytoplankton, including the species composition, density, biomass dominance, biodiversity and water quality parameters, in autumn 2018 and spring and summer 2019. The relationships between the community structure and the main environmental factors were analysed using a multivariate statistical method. A total of 143 species of phytoplankton were identified, belonging to 53 genera and eight phyla, andCyanophytaandProchlorophytawere the most dominant phyla. Both the density and the biomass were the highest in the summer. A redundancy analysis showed that total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand were the primary influencing factors of the community distribution ofCyanophyta. Evaluation of the comprehensive diversity index and water quality index revealed that the water of Shihoudian Lake was lightly to moderately polluted, providing scientific evidence for eco-environmental protection and remediation.						zhu, hao/0000-0002-3848-5969													1735-1472	1735-2630				JUN	2021	18	6					1529	1536		10.1007/s13762-020-02907-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02907-6		SEP 2020											WOS:000565821800001

Given their potential, it is important that weather generators be evaluated, particularly with respect to their ability to capture extreme events. This study was aimed at evaluating weather generator representation of climate extremes with a focus on LARS-WG applied to three stations in the Western Lake Erie Basin, U.S. Generally, LARS-WG captured the number of days with precipitation greater than 50.8 mm (2 in. and 101.6 mm (4 in), 7-day wet sequences, and wet and dry sequences relatively well. The distribution of 1-day maximum precipitation was also generally captured well based on Q-Q plots, although large deviations were seen at the upper tail at one of the stations. The generator greatly underestimated the number of days per year with maximum temperatures greater than 32.2 A degrees C (90 A degrees F) and overestimated the number of days with temperatures less than 0 A degrees C (32 A degrees F). It also underestimated spring and summer values of one-day maximum temperatures across all stations. Fall and winter values were, however, captured fairly well as were seasonal values of one-day minimum temperatures. Overall, the generator performed relatively well in representing extremes within the basin.					; GUO, TIAN/Y-9437-2018; Mehan, Sushant/Q-9862-2016; GUO, TIAN/U-7180-2019	Gitau, Margaret/0000-0002-4931-7047; GUO, TIAN/0000-0002-7166-3376; Mehan, Sushant/0000-0002-1565-9591; 													2198-7491	2198-7505				NOV	2018	5			1	SI		S153	S165		10.1007/s40710-018-0291-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40710-018-0291-x													WOS:000452594000011

In the present work, we studied the monthly and annual occurrence of dust storms at selected weather stations around Urmia Lake in northwestern (NW) Iran. Furthermore, we investigated the variations in the daily aerosol optical depth (AOD at 550 nm) and the angstrom ngstrom exponent (at 412/470 nm), as well as the vertical profile of the total aerosol extinction coefficient and AOD at 532 nm, using space-borne MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aqua and CALIPSO Satellite LiDAR data over the Urmia Lake region (36-39 degrees N, 44-47 degrees E). The monthly variations of AOD(550) and AOD(532) for the regions 37-39 degrees N and 46-59 degrees E were compared, and it was found that the CALIPSO AOD(532) and MODIS AOD(532) (reconstructed using the angstrom ngstrom exponent) were in good agreement. In general, the dust storms during 2000-2021 increased the AOD(550) above average around the Urmia Lake. The vertical profile of aerosols showed that the largest contribution to total aerosol loading over the Urmia Lake was from 1.5-3 km, 1.5-4 km, 1.5-5 km, and 1.5-3 km during winter, spring, summer, and autumn seasons, respectively.					; Saadatabadi, abbas/W-6914-2019; Shukurov, Karim/C-5652-2016; Dumka, Umesh/D-3520-2015	Hossein Hamzeh, Nasim/0000-0003-2089-311X; Dumka, Dr Umesh Chandra/0000-0001-7113-6480; Opp, Christian/0000-0001-7034-6945; Shukurov, Karim/0000-0002-0269-6633; 														2072-4292				AUG	2022	14	15							3827	10.3390/rs14153827	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14153827													WOS:000839754100001

The study involved 30 individual fish caught in spring, summer, and autumn. The muscle samples for analyses were taken from the large side muscle of the fish body above the lateral line. Metals concentrations were determined by atomic a Solar 969 absorption spectrophotometer (Unicam). As analysis shows, concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Fe detected in perch decreased in the following order: liver > gills > meat. The accumulation of metals decreased in the following order: Fe > Zn > Cu (in all tissues), and we observed statistically significant differences in Zn, Fe, and Cu concentrations in the same tissue collected from different reservoirs and during different seasons. Considering the analyses in terms of season, the average Cu and Zn contents were highest in the tissues taken in the spring. The highest concentrations of Fe were determined in samples collected during summer. The analyses indicated that concentrations of metals in tissues of fish caught from different reservoirs also showed great variation. Analysis of PCA allowed for a very good separation of the three reservoirs and three tissues investigated.

J	VANDIJK, GM; VANZANTEN, B				VANDIJK, GM; VANZANTEN, B			SEASONAL-CHANGES IN ZOOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE IN THE LOWER RHINE DURING 1987-1991	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Zooplankton in the River Rhine was surveyed for five years at the Dutch sampling stations, Lobith (German/Dutch border) and Maassluis (at the paint of discharge of the river into the North Sea). The zooplankton abundance showed an apparent seasonal pattern at both stations, characterized by low densities during the winter period, and higher densities during the summer period, with a spring peak. Zooplankton was dominated by rotifers at both stations, although during the winter periods the contribution of copepods was considerable. The rotifers were dominated by Brachionus angularis, B. calyciflorus, Keratella cochlearis and K. quadrata; the copepods by cyclopoid nauplii; the cladocerans by small-sized species mainly belonging to Bosmina. At Maassluis the relative contribution of copepods was higher than at Lobith. Furthermore, the zooplankton at Maassluis included the species Eurytemora affinis, characteristic for estuarine conditions. In spring, the rotifer density and water temperature and rotifer density and chlorophyll a concentration were positively correlated. Furthermore, both rotifer density and chlorophyll a were inversely correlated with discharge. The possible role of environmental factors (water temperature, chlorophyll content, discharge and biotic factors) controlling the river zooplankton dynamics is indicated.																			0018-8158					MAY 5	1995	304	1					29	38		10.1007/BF02530701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02530701													WOS:A1995RD41500004
J	FOWLER, DB; HAMM, JW				FOWLER, DB; HAMM, JW			CROP RESPONSE TO SALINE SOIL-CONDITIONS IN THE PARKLAND AREA OF SASKATCHEWAN	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												The salinity tolerance of 6 annual crop species, wheat, oats, barley, rye, flax and rapeseed, were determined on saline soils that occur north of the Quill Lakes in the northeastern corner of the agricultural area of Saskatechewan. The relative merits of a salt-tolerant grass-legume mixture were also given consideration. The effects of salt stress on spring-sown cultivars became most apparent following exposure to hot, dry summer weather. In contrast, maximum salt tolerance for both winter wheat and winter rye was a function of winterkill. The winterhardiness of both winter annuals was reduced by saline conditions, but winter rye was more adversely affected than winter wheat. Large decreases in seed yield, plant dry weight and height occurred before the effects of increased soil conductivity were expressed for hectoliter weight, 1000-kernel weight, date of maturity, protein content and oil content. Among the spring and winter annual cultivars considered, ''Bonanza'' barley and ''Garry'' oats demonstrated the greatest salt tolerance. However, where severely saline conditions occurred, mixtures of salt-tolerant perennial grasses and alfalfa proved to be more productive than either barley or oats. The salinity tolerance of all cultivars was greater for years with more favorable growing conditions. It was apparent that stress factors, such as soil salinity, cold, heat, drought, etc., have a cumulative effect in reducing crop performance. This observation emphasizes the importance of minimizing all stress factors when attempting to crop saline soils. Where salts were a problem, the level of salinity was extremely variable, often changing dramatically over short distances. This extreme variability made it difficult to assess the magnitude of the salinity problem. In this regard, crop performance, especially plant height, provided a good indicator for identifying saline areas for purposes of soil testing.

In late autumn, a compensatory growth was observed in fish which could have suffer from unfavorable dietary conditions in summer. The seasonal determination of phytoplankton and zooplankton biochemical composition indicated a maximal nutritional value in summer. Conversely, a decreasing of available quantity was observed in autumn what implies an extension of dietary spectrum in the two species. In summer, the interannual variability of population structure and available plankton biomass should explain the use of energy reserves in fishes during that season.																			0003-4088						1996	32	1					63	76		10.1051/limn/1996006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1996006													WOS:A1996UW78100006
J	Mortimer, CH				Mortimer, CH			Physical and chemical aspects of organic production in lakes	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												The potential production of algae in a lake is limited by temp., light, and the rate of supply of certain nutrient substances, notably nitrates and phosphates, to the water from the mud and the drainage basin. Thermal stratification of lake water in summer and mixing in winter impose a seasonal rhythm on production. Methods of measuring production and the value of chemical data in forecasting production in large bodies of water are discussed. Although the fish production in measured carp ponds is about the same (190 lbs. per acre) as meat production on good pasture, fish production in natural waters falls far below this figure.																			0003-4746	1744-7348				FEB	1939	26	1					167	172																WOS:000188234000013

The respective numbers of the sites recorded were 137 and 257. The increase in the number of sites was due to their higher density in the earlier occupied areas and to the expansion of beavers westwards and southwards. The most preferred habitats of beavers were lakes and rivers (19786-77: lakes 43%, rivers 47%; 1984-85: lakes 49%, rivers 38%). Females produced 1.7 young per litter, and 68% of pairs reproduced. In 1977-85, 217 beavers were captured in the Suwalki Lakeland. It has been found that a high proportion (56%) of beavers had black hair, females slightly outnumbered males (54:46), and the proportion of adults was high in the population. Adult females were heavier than adult males. Young beavers gained weight during their first winter, whereas the weight of adults decreased during winter. The beaver population of the Suwalki Lakeland enters a stable phase, and soon an annual reduction of animal numbers will be needed.																			0001-7051	2190-3743				OCT	1986	31	15-26					311	325																WOS:A1986F938200010

Planktonic diatoms and selected environmental parameter were examined monthly over 3 years. The diatom assemblages exhibited obvious seasonal succession in this lake. Cyclostephanos dubius and Stephanodiscus hantzschii were the dominant species in winter, representing a coolwater, cutrophic diatom assemblage. The dominant diatom species changed to Cyclotella atomus and Cyclotella meneghiniana in summer and autumn, which represent warmwater, eutrophic taxa.

A Comparison of Seasonal Movement Patterns of Yellow Perch in Simple and Complex Lake Basins	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Determining the seasonal movement patterns of fish can provide insight into their spawning behaviors, predator-prey interactions, and habitat preferences. To investigate the seasonal movement patterns of adult yellow perch and how they are affected by lake habitat characteristics, we attached ultrasonic transmitters to two length-groups (210-235 and 250-280 mm total length) of yellow perch from populations inhabiting two temperate lakes differing in habitat diversity and basin morphology. In the simple lake, yellow perch distributions differed between seasons, mean depth and distance from shore being greatest during the summer. The observed seasonal differences were similar between the two length-groups. In the complex lake, yellow perch depth varied seasonally, the fish occupying deeper waters during the fall and shallower ones during the summer; however, the distance from shore was consistent among seasons. During the spring, males inhabited areas closer to shore than females in the complex lake, whereas the spatial distributions did not differ between sexes in the simple basin. Yellow perch from both lakes displayed similar seasonal variation in activity, movement rates being highest during the fall and lowest during the summer. Movement rates in the simple lake, however, were higher than those in the complex lake during all three seasons, which suggests that the effectiveness of passive sampling gears may vary in response to habitat complexity. These results reveal several seasonal differences in yellow perch habitat use, distribution, and activity in relation to basin complexity that may provide insight for managers considering sampling plans for individual lake types.																			0275-5947					FEB	2010	30	1					179	190		10.1577/M08-243.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-243.1													WOS:000277113900016
J	Moras, S; Ayala, AI; Pierson, DC				Moras, Simone; Ayala, Ana, I; Pierson, Don C.			Historical modelling of changes in Lake Erken thermal conditions	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Historical lake water temperature records are a valuable source of information to assess the influence of climate change on lake thermal structure. However, in most cases such records span a short period of time and/or are incomplete, providing a less credible assessment of change. In this study, the hydrodynamic GOTM (General Ocean Turbulence Model, a hydrodynamic model configured in lake mode) was used to reconstruct daily profiles of water temperature in Lake Erken (Sweden) over the period 1961-2017 using seven climatic parameters as forcing data: wind speed (WS), air temperature (Air T), atmospheric pressure (Air P), relative humidity (RH), cloud cover (CC), precipitation (DP), and shortwave radiation (SWR). The model was calibrated against observed water temperature data collected during the study interval, and the calibrated model revealed a good match between modelled and observed temperature (RMSE = 1.089 degrees C). From the long-term simulations of water temperature, this study focused on detecting possible trends in water temperature over the entire study interval 1961-2017 and in the sub-intervals 1961-1988 and 1989-2017, since an abrupt change in air temperature was detected in 1988. The analysis of the simulated temperature showed that epilimnetic temperature increased on average by 0.444 and 0.792 degrees C per decade in spring and autumn in the sub-interval 1989-2017 Summer epilimnetic temperature increased by 0.351 degrees C per decade over the entire interval 1961-2017. Hypolimnetic temperature increased significantly in spring over the entire interval 1961-2017, by 0.148 and by 0.816 degrees C per decade in autumn in the subinterval 1989-2016. Whole-lake temperature showed a significant increasing trend in the sub-interval 1989-2017 during spring (0.404 degrees C per decade) and autumn (0.789 degrees C per decade, interval 1989-2016), while a significant trend was detected in summer over the entire study interval 1961-2017 (0.239 degrees C per decade). Moreover, this study showed that that changes in the phenology of thermal stratification have occurred over the 57-year period of study. Since 1961, the stability of stratification (Schmidt stability) has increased by 5.365 J M-2 per decade. The duration of thermal stratification has increased by 7.297 d per decade, corresponding to an earlier onset of stratification of similar to 16 d and to a delay of stratification termination of similar to 26 d. The average thermocline depth during stratification became shallower by similar to 1.345 m, and surface-bottom temperature difference increased over time by 0.249 degrees C per decade. The creation of a daily time step water temperature dataset not only provided evidence of changes in Erken thermal structure over the last decades, but is also a valuable resource of information that can help in future research on the ecology of Lake Erken. The use of readily available meteorological data to reconstruct Lake Erken's past water temperature is shown to be a useful method to evaluate long-term changes in lake thermal structure, and it is a method that can be extended to other lakes.					; Ayala, Ana I./KNL-0648-2024	Ayala Zamora, Ana Isabel/0000-0003-3986-5100; Pierson, Donald/0000-0001-6230-0146; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				DEC 13	2019	23	12					5001	5016		10.5194/hess-23-5001-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-5001-2019													WOS:000502998000001
J	Haberyan, KA				Haberyan, Kurt A.			Mozingo Studies I. Ice phenology and limnological legacies in a mid-continental reservoir	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Long-term, integrated records of limnology are rare in the central United States. Mozingo Lake is a reservoir in northwestern Missouri that was sampled regularly since its creation in 1994. Physical data were collected during 121 visits and compared to meteorological observations. July hypolimnetic temperatures have risen rapidly (2.4 degrees C / decade: P=0.037), suggesting weakened summer stratification in the future. Winter conditions were rarely correlated with lake conditions in the following July; the exception is July epilimnion temperature, which correlated with ice-over date, January hypolimnion temperature, and ice duration (P=0.006, 0.010, and 0.024). In contrast, winter ice-over date was best correlated with air temperature in the preceding July (P=0.006); other factors were not significantly correlated, including fall air temperatures, July epilimnion temperatures, and October water column temperatures. Analysis of air temperatures preceding ice-over revealed that the strongest correlation was with a 68-day average air temperature of 4.8 degrees C. July air temperatures, along with ice-over date, correlated with January ice thickness and ice duration (P=0.014 and 0.001, respectively). This suggests that a warm July is associated with a mild winter, a relationship confirmed by a significant correlation (P=0.011). Ice thickness, ice duration, and ice-out date also correlated with winter air temperature (P <= 0.003 for each). It therefore appears that summer conditions influence winter conditions which, in turn, influence certain lake conditions in the following summer; this observation indicates that winter conditions may not reset physical parameters in lakes. Legacies thus may span various intervals, ranging from a week to a year or more. Although the Mozingo Lake record is brief (20 years), it suggests directions for longer-term studies. Multi-year legacy effects have rarely been documented, but in Mozingo Lake they suggest that a single strong climatic anomaly may affect the lake for several years.

The results show that: (1) Climatic comfort in winter and summer shows a trend from low latitude to high latitude, while in summer it is opposite. (2) Climatic comfort in winter shows a significant trend from low altitude to high altitude, while in summer it is opposite. (3) The ocean has a good regulating effect on apparent temperature in winter and summer, but it is not obvious in the level of climate comfort.

Stopover Duration of Mallards During Autumn in the Illinois River Valley	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Estimates of time spent at migratory stopovers are often used to develop habitat conservation objectives for a variety of avian species, namely waterfowl. Because of limited previous research and a need for accurate conservation planning objectives, we estimated stopover duration and factors influencing stay of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in Illinois using radio telemetry during autumns 2009 and 2010. Total stopover duration of migrating mallards was approximately 68 days and was approximately twice that of previous studies which could have significant implications on habitat needs used for conservation planning purposes. Duration of stay post-capture did not vary by sex, body condition, year, or age but was inversely related to capture date. Our results suggest that wetland conservation objectives could increase 16.2% if our contemporary estimates were included in current planning models of the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture.

Primary production was measured during a 7-yr period from 1974 to 1982. The lake is fed mostly by groundwater. The lake is 83 km2 in area with an average depth of 34 m and a volume of 2855 x 10(6) m3 . Retention time is 330 d and average ice-cover 95 d yr-1. Mean global radiation is 74.5 kcal (311.7 kJ) cm-2 yr-1. Secchi disc transparency ranges from 6 to 15 m, and the photic layer extends from 20 to 40 m during summer (1% of subsurface light penetration). Consequently, primary production was measured down to 25 m, in a few cases to 30 m depth. The temperature ranges from 0 to 13-degrees-C. The nutrients N, P and Si enter the lake at fluxes of 1.4, 0.8 and 240 g M-2 yr-1, or in the ratios of 1.7:1:300. The NO3-N as well as the NH4-N concentrations generally vary from ca. 6-8-mu-g l-1 to 0, but may reach 18 and 33-mu-g l-1, respectively, after autumn overturn. Phytoplankton production is nitrogen-limited. PO4-P amounts to ca. 10, but may occasionally reach 14 L-mu-g l-1. Large diatom species, as Melosira islandica and M. italica, dominate except in summer. Smaller species, as Stephanodiscus astraea, Asterionella formosa and Nitzschia holsatica, take over in spring and sometimes throughout the summer. The midsummer phytoplankton is mostly Chrysophyceae and Pyrrophyta. Large diatoms return in autumn. Phytoplankton production is bimodal with a spring (max. 1.53 g C M 2 d-1) and an early autumn peak (max. 0.66 g C m-2 d-1) of diatoms; and a summer minimum (0.1 g C m-2 d-1) of mainly Chrysophyceae. Biomass follows the same trend and, measured as Chl a, it ranges from 0.5 to 4.0 mg m-3. In years with unstable thermocline, production stabilizes at 0.3 to 0.4 g C M-2 d-1. Mean annual production is 95 g C m-2. Light-saturated photosynthesis occurs at 1-10 m depth and maximum daily production is 200 mg C m-3. Activity coefficients based on production, Chl a. biomass and P/B ratios were calculated. Data show that the production of North Atlantic Rift lakes considerably exceeds that of natural lakes on the Northern American and European continental plates at similar latitudes.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					162	187		10.2307/3545051	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545051													WOS:A1992JG50900014
J	Stadmark, J; Leonardson, L				Stadmark, Johanna; Leonardson, Lars			Greenhouse gas production in a pond sediment: Effects of temperature, itrate, acetate and season	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this paper we investigate the impact of nitrate (NO(3)(-)) concentration and temperature on the production of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O). We studied sediment collected during spring, summer and autumn from a constructed pond in South Sweden. Homogenised sediment samples were dark incubated in vitro under N(2) atmosphere at 13 degrees C and 20 degrees C after addition of five NO(3)(-) concentrations, between 0 and 16 mg NO(3)(-) -N per litre. We found higher net production of N(2)O and CO, at the higher temperature. Moreover, increased NO(3)(-) concentrations had strong positive impact on the N(2)O(3) concentration, but no effect on CH(4) and CO(2) production. The lack of response in CO(2) is suggested to be due to the use of alternative oxidants as electron acceptors. Interaction between NO(3)(-) and temperature suggests a further increase of N(2O), net production when both NO(3) and temperature are high. Our interpretation of the CH(4) data is that at high concentrations of NO(3) temperature is of less importance for CH(4) production. We also found that at 13 degrees C CH(4) production was substrate limited and that the addition of acetate increased CH(4) as well as CO(2) production. There was a seasonal effect on gas production potential, with more CH(4) and NO produced in spring than in summer. Re-calculation of the gas concentrations into global warming potential (GWP) units (i.e. CO(2), CH4, and N(2)O transferred to CO(2) equivalents) shows that GWP increases with temperature. However, under environmental conditions generally occurring in South Swedish ponds, i.e. low temperature and high NO(3) concentration during spring and high temperature and low NO(3) concentration during summer, NO(3)(-) concentration is of minor importance.

INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												After an absence of 40 years, mayfly nymphs of the genus Hexagenia were found in sediments of western Lake Erie of the Laurentian Great Lakes in 1993 and, by 1997, were abundant enough to meet a mayfly-density management goal (ca. 350 nymphs m(-2)) based on pollution-abatement programs. We sampled nymphs in western Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair, located upstream of western Lake Erie, to determine the importance of seasonal abundance and life-history characteristics of nymphs (e.g., emergence and recruitment) on density estimates relative to the mayfly-density management peal. Two types of density patterns were observed: (1) densities were relatively high in spring and gradually decreased through late summer (observed in Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair in 1997 and Lake St. Clair in 1999) and (2) densities were relatively high in spring, gradually decreased to mid summer, abruptly decreased in mid summer, and then increased between summer and late fall (Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair in 1998 and Lake Erie in 1999). Length-frequency distributions of nymphs and observations of adults indicate that the primary cause for the two density patterns was attributed to failed (first pattern) and successful (second pattern) reproduction and emergence of nymphs into adults in mid summer. Gradual declines in densities were attributed to mortality of nymphs. Our results indicate that caution should be used when evaluating progress of pollution-abatement programs based on mayfly densities because recruitment success is variable both between and within years. Additionally, the interpretation of progress toward management goals, relative to the restoration of Hexagenia populations in the Great Lakes and possibly other water bodies throughout the world, is influenced by the number of years in which consequtive collections are made.																			1434-2944						2001	86	1					87	103		10.1002/1522-2632(200101)86:1<87::AID-IROH87>3.3.CO;2-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1522-2632(200101)86:1<87::AID-IROH87>3.3.CO;2-X													WOS:000166917400005

Major shift in the phenology of crustacean biomass in western Lake Superior associated with temperature anomaly	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Variable weather patterns during the early months of 2014 and 2015 resulted in differences between years in spring and summer surface water temperatures in the offshore areas of western Lake Superior. Zooplankton were collected in western Lake Superior during several cruises from late spring to early fall in 2014 and 2015 to test the hypotheses that colder summer water temperatures in 2014 were correlated with reduced zooplankton biomass, later peaks in zooplankton biomass, and a smaller contribution of warm-water taxa to the zooplankton assemblage. The total amount of zooplankton biomass from early June through early October did not differ greatly between years. Of the taxonomic subcategories (large-bodied calanoids, small-bodied calanoids, cyclopoids, nauplii, and herbivorous cladocerans) however, cyclopoid and cladoceran biomass was somewhat smaller in 2014 compared to 2015, providing some support for the hypothesis that warm-water taxa contribute less to offshore zooplankton biomass in colder years. The timing of peak biomass for cladocerans, small-bodied calanoids, and cyclopoids did not differ between years, but peaks in the biomass of copepod nauplii and large bodied calanoids (primarily Limnocalanus macrurus) occurred several weeks later in 2014 than 2015 which was evidence for phenological delay during a year with unusually cold spring and summer surface water temperatures. Though this study only evaluates the role of temperature in driving zooplankton biomass and phenology in Lake Superior, it does provide insight into the potential effects of climate variability on the Lake Superior food web.

In this paper, we studied LCAs in the surface sediments (0-10 cm) of nine sulfate lakes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province, China. LCAs are detected in eight of the nine lakes, except a dry salt lake - Lake Lop. The result shows that LCAs might be universal in the sulfate lakes. In most of the surface samples, the sequence of the abundance of the long-chain alkenones is C-37>C-38>C-39>C-40. And C-37:4 methyl ketone is a predominant compound in the C-37 alkenone homologue. Based on regression analysis of U-37(K')-ratios and the average annual, seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, winter) temperatures, the linear relativity of U-37(K')-ratios and mean annual temperatures is superior to the others, and the correlation coefficient is 0.88 2 (r(2) = 0.88). The linear relationship of U-37(K') and the average annual temperature in different water chemistry environments suggests that the mechanisms controlling U-37(K') index in the saline lakes might be the same as those in the ocean environment. The alkenone unsaturation could become an important paleotemperature proxy in the lacustrine environment.																			1001-6538					OCT	2004	49	19					2082	2086		10.1360/03wd0298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/03wd0298													WOS:000225725000014

Coupling remote sensing bio-optical and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling to study the phytoplankton dynamics in a tropical hydroelectric reservoir	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which mixing and stratification processes influence the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution in a tropical hydroelectric reservoir in Brazil. We used a synergistic approach that combines remote sensing bio-optical empirical and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling to represent phytoplankton dynamics. Seasonal differences were evaluated by simulating the bio-optical and the three-dimensional hydrodynamic models for two periods: the austral summer and winter of 2009. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model simulations showed that the water column was completely mixed during winter; the water column remained stratified during summer. We also noticed a permanent thermocline during the summer between 15 and 25 m in the reservoir. In both seasons, the surface current was wind driven and preferentially directed eastward. The bio-optical model showed that the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution, as indicated by chlorophyll-a concentration, was heterogeneous during winter and homogenous during summer. Moreover, higher concentrations were observed by the empirical bio-optical model during winter (the highest mean areal concentration was 24 mu g L-1) than in summer (2.1 mu g L-1). This difference was explained by short timescale events, such as cold front passages, which contributed to the proliferation of phytoplankton in winter by enhancing vertical mixing in the water column. Lake number analysis showed that upwelling events were the most common mechanisms driving the mixing process during winter (L-N < 1 82% of the time). Combining remote sensing and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling makes it possible to more fully analyze the dynamics of the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution under different meteorological conditions. The two modeling techniques can be used in a complementary manner and serve as an essential tool for the environmental monitoring of aquatic systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Site fidelity and seasonal changes in activity centre size of female pike Esox lucius in a small lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The object of this study was to test site fidelity of female pike Esox lucius and to contrast the activity centre size in summer and winter in a 25 ha lake in north-eastern Germany using radio telemetry. Weekly 24 h tracking and two 96 h tracking exercises were conducted by boat from June to December 2005 and by walking on surface ice from January to February 2006. Positions of 12 E. lucius [total length (L-T) = 450-733 mm] were recorded every 3 h within a 24 h tracking cycle. Site fidelity to individual summer activity centres was tested by translocating eight E. lucius away from their activity centre. All translocated E. lucius returned to their summer activity centre within 6 days, which provided evidence of site fidelity of E. lucius. There was no relation between E. lucius (L-T) or the translocation distance and return time to the activity centre after translocation. In winter, the activity centre size of E. lucius was significantly larger than in summer, but there was considerable overlap between the sites chosen in winter and those in summer. The seasonal variation in activity centre size possibly reflected changes in habitat structure (e.g. collapse of structured vegetated habitats in winter) or prey fish distribution.

However, little is known about its chemical composition, optical characterization, potential sources, and controlling mechanisms in peri-urban atmospheric rainwater. One-year rainfall samples were collected between September 2018 and August 2019 in a Nanjing suburb. Stoichiometric, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption, and three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) analyses were utilized to characterize DOM. Several proxies for DOM concentration, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and absorption coefficient (a254), exhibited power-function relationships with the rainfall amount (r(2) = 0.33-0.55, p < 0.001). Particularly, the DOC and a254 value showed significant seasonal variability, with lower value in two wet seasons (winter and summer) than in the dry seasons (autumn and spring). The annual wet depositional (WD) flux of DOC in the Xianlin (XL) site was calculated as 1.68 g C m(-2) yr(-1), agreeing with the range of global WD flux values. Two terrestrial humic-like components (C1-C2), one microbial humic-like component (C3), and one tryptophan-like component (C4) were identified by EEM-PARAFAC in rainwater DOM. The results of the specific absorption indices (SUVA(254), S-R) and PARAFAC component analyses revealed that summer DOM samples had lower fluorescence intensities, aromatic contents, and molecular sizes. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on DOM indices showed that rainwater DOM had predominantly terrestrial humic origins, while this characteristic became slightly weaker in summer. The quantity and quality of rainwater DOM were closely related to meteorological variables (i.e., air mass, rainfall amount, and solar radiation) as well as anthropogenic activities. This study could improve the understanding of the quantity and quality of rainwater DOM on carbon budgets and biogeochemical cycling from some new insights of optical proxies about different fates of rainwater DOM under complex controlling mechanisms.

J	Liu, ZH; Li, Y; Wang, XG				Liu, Zhenhai; Li, Yun; Wang, Xiaogang			Seasonal variations in cadmium mobility in sediment-water systems of algae- and macrophyte-dominated zones in Lake Taihu	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Variations in trophic status affect water quality and sediment geochemistry, thereby influencing cadmium (Cd) mobility and its release into the water column. This study conducted seasonal sampling in algae-and macrophyte-dominated zones of Lake Taihu, China, using high-resolution dialysis and multispectral techniques to simultaneously monitor Cd, manganese (Mn), ferrous iron (Fe(II)), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediment pore water. A sudden Cd release was observed in April in eutrophic, algae-dominated sediments, attributed to Cd complexation with tyrosine. Redundancy analysis (RDA) confirmed tyrosine as a key factor driving this Cd release. Multispectral analysis further showed that Cd was stably bound to functional groups in tyrosine-like substances, including aromatic C-H (630 cm-1), alcoholic C-O (1150 cm-1), phenolic O-H (1350 cm-1), alkene C=C (1630 cm-1), and aliphatic-COOH (3320 cm-1). In summer and autumn, Cd mobility in algae-dominated areas was mainly regulated by cyanobacterial uptake and redox reactions involving iron--manganese oxides. In macrophyte zones, DOM influenced soluble Cd in winter, while lower Cd levels in summer and autumn likely resulted from adsorption onto iron-manganese oxide-rich sediments, enhanced by photochemical processes and rhizosphere oxidation. Overall, Cd contamination in algae-dominated systems warrants greater attention.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				NOV 15	2025	385								127139	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.127139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.127139		SEP 2025						40975261					WOS:001577639000001

The downscaled projections showed that the basin would be wetter at the annual scale during the next 80 years. Precipitation in spring would be increase over the entire basin under all future scenarios except SSP1-2.6. Parts of the PL basin exhibit drier trends under the four scenarios in summer, with the largest drying area occurring in the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Except in the SSP2-4.5 scenario, precipitation in autumn has increasing trends in all scenarios across the PL basin. Precipitation in winter shows a drying trend in some areas except in the SSP1-2.6 scenario, with the largest area occurring in SSP5-8.5. The results provide improved precipitation information for policy-making in water resource management and adaptation planning to mitigate Yangtze River floods in the future.																				2214-5818				AUG	2022	42								101138	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101138		JUN 2022											WOS:000822695600001

Daphnia hyalina is dominant in spring and D. cucullata in summer and autumn. Size frequency distributions were converted into instar frequency distributions by using experimental growth curves and field measurements on newborn size and the size at first reproduction. A discrete event computer model was used to calculate the instar mortality rates. Relative importances of instar mortality rates for the population mortality rate were calculated and discussed. The mortality of the juvenile stages was found to be more importnat than adult mortality during most of the sampling season, despite egg mortality when egg-bearing females are killed. Only in September and October was the mortality of adult instars more important. Correlation coefficients between differences in the rates of increase and differences in mean brood size and instar mortalities show that the former are caused mainly by differences in juvenile mortality, the main factor determining the replacement of D. hyalina by D. cucullata during early summer.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY	1989	11	3					487	502		10.1093/plankt/11.3.487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.3.487													WOS:A1989U540800005

Three hypotheses for this migration were: (1) to reduce insect harassment, (2) to seek more abundant or nutritious forage, or (3) to reduce predation risk. The food and insect relief hypotheses were neither necessary nor sufficient explanations for the spring migration of the animals. Caribou used the shoreline of the two largest occupied islands even in the absence of insects. There was less green forage on the islands than on the winter range and the smaller islands were overgrazed. The dispersed nature of the population, the use of shorelines useful for escape, and the avoidance of islands travelled by wolves, Canis lupus, suggest that the migration of this herd was a spacing tactic to reduce predation risk. In other woodland caribou herds in North America, animals are also widely spaced in relatively safe habitats after spring migration, which suggests that migration and dispersion may be a common tactic to reduce predation risk especially for females and neonates.																			0003-3472	1095-8282				FEB	1990	39		2				360	368		10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80882-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80882-6													WOS:A1990CM68100019

Phosphorus partitioning in a shallow lake: implications for water quality management	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												This paper describes the seasonal partitioning of phosphorus (P) across the sediment-water interface in Loch Leven, Scotland, and discusses the implications for future lake management strategy with respect to recovery from eutrophication. In a 10-month survey, surface water total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were highest in late summer and lowest in early spring. In contrast, sediment TP concentrations were highest in mid-winter and lowest in late summer. Water discharge at the main outflow of the loch was highest when water-column TP was low and sediment TP high, and vice versa. Monthly sediment P uptake/release values showed significant cycling between the water-column and the sediment and showed seasonal variation in four release-sensitive P pools. Regulating the water level to increase flushing during sediment release periods and decrease flushing during uptake periods has the potential to significantly enhance the recovery of shallow lakes and reservoirs following historic nutrient loading.

The variations in the surface heat source and its influence on the plateau summer monsoon have become attractive and important. The Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), driven by the forcing data from CRUNCEP, was used to simulate the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of the SH and LH from 1980 to 2010 over the SRYR. The simulated SH and LH are compared to the situ measurements of the Maduo climatic monitoring station from the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources. In addition, the relationships between the SH, LH and plateau summer monsoon have also been analysed. The results show that the seasonal mean SH reaches its maximum in spring and its minimum in winter. For the annual SH, there is an increasing trend in the early period and then a decreasing trend, while the variation trends of the LH are opposite to those of the SH flux. In addition, the LH transfer in summer reaches a maximum; the SH flux in the northern SRYR was higher in spring and summer. The SH of the two lakes, Lake Gyaringand Lake Ngoring, are significantly smaller than those of the surrounding areas. For the spatial distributions of the annual mean flux, the SH flux presented larger values over the central SRYR, while it presented smaller values in the southern areas. The LH shows an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast of the SRYR. Meanwhile, the LH transport over the two lakes is notably higher than those of the surrounding areas. The time series of SH amplitude shows that it changes every 6-10 a. The SH amplitude is a mostly positive anomaly in the spatial distribution of the first pattern. EOF2 shows a high west of 101 degrees E and a low centre east of 101 degrees E; the relationship between the SH in spring and the different plateau summer monsoon indices are negatively correlated over SRYR. The negative correlations between the SH flux and ZPMI, DPMI, and QPMI are more remarkable in the northeast of the region.

Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) could provide one possible option, but its management could cause conflict with the busy fall and early spring activities for spring-seeded crops. A study was conducted at five sites (Swift Current, 4 yr; Melfort, 4 yr; and Scott, Lashburn, and Loon Lake, 1 yr each) in four soil zones (Brown, Dark Brown, and Black Chernozems and Gray Luvisol). The effect of time of application of N (seeding to early spring), source of N (ammonium nitrate vs. urea), and method of application (broadcast, midrow band, and seed-placed) on yield and grain protein concentration were investigated. The results varied with site and year (weather). Time of N application only influenced yields at Swift Current (Brown soil) where application on cool unfrozen soil in mid-October was as good as application in early spring and better than at other times, and application onto frozen, snow-covered soil in December was least effective. At Swift Current and Melfort, grain protein concentration did not respond to time of application; however, at Scott, Lashburn and Loon Lake, protein was highest for spring-applied N, followed by mid-October, and lowest when N was applied on frozen snow-covered soil. The effect of N source rarely affected grain yield or protein and was dependent on site and method of placement. The dangers of seed-placing N, especially urea, on overwinter survival and yields were evident in 2 yr at Swift Current. There was rarely any difference in yield or grain protein concentration when N was banded or broadcast at seeding time. Taking into account convenience of operation, the most opportune time for Saskatchewan producers involved in growing both spring and winter wheat to apply N would be mid-October in the Brown soil zone. In the other soil zones, early spring would be best. Broadcasting the N was the most appropriate method of application at all sites. Urea would be chosen over ammonium nitrate because there was little advantage of one source over the other and urea is generally cheaper.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				MAY	1991	71	2					177	187		10.4141/cjss91-017	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjss91-017													WOS:A1991FU49700005

Spring samples, diatom-dominated displayed a much more shade-adapted photosynthetic-light response than did the summer samples, which were flagellate- and picoplankton-dominated. The kinetics of photoinhibition in both spring and summer obeyed a cumulative exposure-dependent model. The sensitivity of UVR and, especially, PAR was far greater in spring than summer. The modeled impact of UVR and PAR on column-investigated production varied between spring and summer and with differing assumptions about vertical mixing rates. The most consistent biochemical response to UVR stress was decreased allocation to polysaccharide, consistent with a diminished carbon and energy income. Allocation to protein was commonly diminished by UVR stress in longer incubations but was more conserved than polysaccharide. Allocation to total lipids and among major lipid classes was relatively insensitive to UVR.

S	Mitchell, JL; Lora, JM		Jeanloz, R; Freeman, KH		Mitchell, Jonathan L.; Lora, Juan M.			The Climate of Titan	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, VOL 44	Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences											Over the past decade, the Cassini-Huygens mission to the Saturn system has revolutionized our understanding of Titan and its climate. Veiled in a thick organic haze, Titan's visible appearance belies an active, seasonal weather cycle operating in the lower atmosphere. Here we review the climate of Titan, as gleaned from observations and models. Titan's cold surface temperatures (similar to 90 K) allow methane to form clouds and precipitation analogously to Earth's hydrologic cycle. Because of Titan's slow rotation and small size, its atmospheric circulation falls into a regime resembling Earth's tropics, with weak horizontal temperature gradients. A general overview of how Titan's atmosphere responds to seasonal forcing is provided by estimating a number of climate-related timescales. Titan lacks a global ocean, but methane is cold-trapped at the poles in large seas, and models indicate that weak baroclinic storms form at the boundary of Titan's wet and dry regions. Titan's saturated troposphere is a substantial reservoir of methane, supplied by deep convection from the summer poles. A significant seasonal cycle, first revealed by observations of clouds, causes Titan's convergence zone to migrate deep into the summer hemispheres, but its connection to polar convection remains undetermined. Models suggest that downwelling of air at the winter pole communicates upper-level radiative cooling, reducing the stability of the middle troposphere and priming the atmosphere for spring and summer storms when sunlight returns to Titan's lakes. Despite great gains in our understanding of Titan, many challenges remain. The greatest mystery is how Titan is able to retain an abundance of atmospheric methane with only limited surface liquids, while methane is being irreversibly destroyed by photochemistry. A related mystery is how Titan is able to hide all the ethane that is produced in this process. Future studies will need to consider the interactions between Titan's atmosphere, surface, and subsurface in order to make further progress in understanding Titan's complex climate system.

The Lysuholl hot-spring deposits, located in western Iceland, are formed primarily of siliceous sinters that were precipitated around numerous springs that are now inactive. Calcite travertine formed around the vent and on the discharge apron of one of the springs at the northern edge of the area. The travertine is formed largely of two types (I and II) of complex calcite dendrite crystals, up to 1 cm high, that grew through the gradual addition of trilete sub-crystals. The morphology of the dendrite crystals was controlled by flow direction and the competition for growth space with neighbouring crystals. Densely crowded dendrites with limited branching characterize the rimstone dams whereas widely spaced dendrites with open branching are found in the pools. Many dendrite bushes in the pools nucleated around plant stems. Growth of the dendrite crystals was seasonal and incremental. Calcite precipitation was driven by rapid CO2 degassing of CO2-rich spring waters during the spring and summer. During winter, when snow covered the ground and temperatures were low, opal-A precipitated on the exposed surfaces of the dendrites. Segmentation of dendrite branches by discontinuities coated with opal-A and overgrowth development around sub-crystals resulted from this seasonal growth cycle. The calcite dendrite crystals in the Lysuholl travertine differ in morphology from those at other hot springs, such as those at Lake Bogoria, Kenya, and Waikite in New Zealand. Comparison with the calcite dendrite crystals found at those sites shows that dendrite morphology is site-specific and probably controlled by carbonate saturation levels that, in turn, are controlled by the rate of CO2 degassing and location in the spring outflow system.

A total of 44 zooplankton species were identified in Ulungur Lake, which were sorted into seven functional groups: protozoan filter feeders (PF), rotifer filter feeders (RF), rotifer carnivores (RC), small copepod and cladoceran filter feeders (SCF), mid-sized copepod and cladoceran filter feeders (MCF), mid-sized copepod and cladoceran carnivores (MCC), and large copepod and cladoceran filter feeders (LCF). The dominant zooplankton functional group varied according to seasonal change. The RF group was dominant in the spring, comprising 87.77% of the total biomass. In the summer, the dominant group was SCF, comprising 90.72% of the total biomass, while the RF group accounted for only 7.24%. In the autumn, the biomass was mainly distributed between the RC (36.38%), SCF (30.62%), and RF (30.06%) groups. This seasonal difference in zooplankton community structure is related to fish production in Ulungur Lake, as well as to the competition and predation relationship among zooplankton species. This study showed a significant positive correlation between the PF and LCF groups, and between the RC, MCC, and MCF groups. This positive correlation was found to be related to the competition and predatory relationships between these functional groups. The predation pressure within the zooplankton functional groups in Ulungur Lake was not as significant as the pressure of food competition. The zooplankton biomass showed no significant difference between spring (0.0615 mg/L) and summer (0.0621 mg/L), but the biomass in autumn (0.3051 mg/L) was significantly increased. Nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) and Secchi Depth (SD) had significant correlations between species and functional groups, and were the major driving factors affecting the community structure of Ulungur Lake. In this study, the seasonal variations in the biomass of zooplankton were strongly influenced by environmental factors, which played an important driving role in structuring the ecological communities of zooplankton.

The Native residents of Kanataq, an historic Pacific coastal village, made broad use of, not only the diverse terrestrial and marine resources of the coastal region, but also other interior terrestrial resources. Historic Kanataq residents wintered amidst plentiful firewood, utilizing stored supplies portaged from the interior supplemented by coastal and maritime resources. They spent their spring and summer inland on Becharof Lake and in the Egegik River drainage, harvesting and preserving large quantities of salmon, gathering, and hunting large mammals for their winter stores.

J	Yang, LY; Wei, J				Yang, Liyan; Wei, Jia			How Severe Was the 2022 Flash Drought in the Yangtze River Basin?	REMOTE SENSING												Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset and severe impacts, have critical implications for the ecological environment and water resource security. However, inconsistent definitions of flash droughts have hindered scientific assessments of drought severity, limiting efforts in disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, we propose a new method for explicitly characterizing flash drought events, with particular emphasis on the process of soil moisture recovery. The temporal and spatial evolution of flash droughts over the Yangtze River Basin was analyzed, and the severity of the extreme flash drought in 2022 was assessed by comparing its characteristics and impacts with those of three typical dry years. Additionally, the driving factors of the 2022 flash drought were evaluated from multiple perspectives. Results indicate that the new identification method for flash droughts is reasonable and reliable. In recent years, the frequency and duration of flash droughts have significantly increased, with the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake basins being particularly affected. Spring and summer were identified as peak seasons for flash droughts, with the middle reaches most affected in spring, while summer droughts tend to impact the entire basin. Compared to 2006, 2011, and 2013, the flash drought in 2022 affected the largest area, with the highest number of grids experiencing two flash drought events and a development rate exceeding 15%. Moreover, the summer heat in 2022 was more extreme than in the other three years, extending from spring to fall, especially during July-August. Its evolution was driven by the Western Pacific Subtropical High, which suppressed precipitation and elevated temperatures. The divergence of water vapor flux intensified water shortages, while anomalies in latent and sensible heat fluxes increased surface evaporation and heat transfer, further disturbing the regional water cycle. This study provides valuable insights for flash drought monitoring and early warning in the context of a changing climate.

J	Fitzgerald, SA; Steuer, JJ				Fitzgerald, SA; Steuer, JJ			Association of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with live algae and total lipids in rivers - a field-based approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The association of PCBs and live algal cells in rivers was studied at four locations during four seasons in two Wisconsin rivers. Positive relations between particle-associated PCBs and both chlorophyll-a and algal carbon concentrations indicated that live algal cells were a significant sorption phase for dissolved PCBs. Large Pennate diatoms (Navicula, Synedra, Pinnularia, Diatoma, and Cocconeis), or more rarely, Euglenoids (Trachelomonas sp.), dominated most sample assemblages on an algal carbon basis. These assemblages made up the highest percentage of total SOC during spring (average=50%) and lowest during summer (average=15%). At the three impounded sites, most individual PCB congeners were relatively enriched in samples characterized by: (1) high concentrations of algal carbon (as a percent of SOC), (2) algal assemblages dominated (or co-dominated) by Euglenoids, and (3) high concentrations of total lipids. Despite relatively higher masses of sorbed PCBs in the most lipid-rich samples, there was no robust correlation between total lipid content and particle-associated PCBs when aggregating all samples from the study. A possible explanation is that PCBs are associated with other structural components in live algae and (or) departure from chemical equilibrium in the river due to algal growth kinetics. A kinetic uptake model was used to calculate the mass of PCBs associated with the total organic carbon content of live algae. Based on this model, PCBs were enriched in algal cells during bloom seasons (spring and fall) compared to non-bloom seasons (summer and winter). Further, although individual PCB congener partition coefficients (log) to live algal cells (range=5.3-6.4) overlapped to those for detritus (range=3.6-7.4), PCBs tended to be enriched in detrital carbon pools during non-bloom conditions. The larger range of estimated PCB partition coefficients for detritus likely reflects the more heterogeneous nature of this material compared to live algal cells.

Grazing rates were measured using the fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) technique. Several factors may potentially influence flagellate grazing, viz. temperature, sediment grain size, bacterial abundance and production, flagellate abundance and biovolume. Flagellate grazing rates were related to these variables. Total grazing of the benthic flagellate population was estimated by multiplying flagellate abundance by maximum/minimum grazing rates. A comparison with the total amount of bacterial cells produced provided an estimate of the impact of flagellate bacterivory on benthic bacterial production. Individual grazing rates ranged from 0 to 112 bacteria per flagellate per hour. Grazing rates showed no significant differences between summer and winter and did not correlate significantly with any of the above-mentioned variables. Maximum average grazing rates ranged from 15 to 39 bacteria per flagellate per hour. Minimum average values varied between 1 and 5 bacteria per flagellate per hour. The percentages of benthic bacterial production accounted for by flagellate consumption differ greatly depending on the grazing rate used. Using maximum grazing rates, 2 to 23% of the bacterial production during summer was consumed, while in winter this ranged from 23 to 528%. Minimum estimates were 10 to 20 times lower: 0.2 to 3% in summer and 1 to 50% in winter. In winter, higher percentages of the bacterial production were consumed, which was probably due to the relatively lower bacterial production in winter compared to summer.					van Duyl, Fleur/P-9711-2016														0077-7579					DEC	1995	34	4					275	287		10.1016/0077-7579(95)90038-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(95)90038-1													WOS:A1995UB69100004

The goal of our study was to assess the nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in channel-bed processes of temporary streams between floods. Results show that, during winter, temperatures ranged between 9.5 and 11.2 degrees C and oxygen concentration ranged from 8.0 to 9.5mg L-1, whereas, during summer, temperatures varied between 21.2 and 26.8 degrees C and oxygen between 1.2 and 5.3 mg L-1, with oxygen depletion in the pools during the night. The nitrate concentrations were far more abundant during winter (February), while ammonium concentration increased after stream fragmentation into pools (especially in July when oxygen depletion conditions favoured ammonification). Results on sediment profiles showed that the most active sediment layers for NH4-N are the top 2-3 cm, corresponding to the sediment depositional sites of the stream. Phosphate concentrations had larger variability, yet concentrations decreased from winter to spring and increased again in summer, when the shallow water pools were formed. Sediment profiles at the sediment depositional sites showed that P0O(4)-P was more dynamic in the first 6 cm. In Mediterranean temporary streams, nutrient dynamics vary seasonally, as the system transits from lotic conditions to shallow lentic conditions, evidencing the regeneration of nutrients from organic and inorganic matter during the flow cessation period.

However, continuous lake temperature monitoring across the Tibetan Plateau is sparse, limiting our understanding of lake thermal and mixing dynamics and hindering the verification of modeling results in this region. Based on in-situ water temperature and meteorological observations, this study revealed a special summer destratification phenomenon of a deep alpine lake, Langa Co. The results indicate that Langa Co is a discontinuous cold polymictic lake, which becomes completely mixed and reaches a homogeneous water temperature frequently during spring and autumn. Further, the intermittent periods of stratification in summer only last a few days, which is rare for such a deep lake. As an example of a discontinuous cold polymictic lake that contrasts with the typical dimictic pattern of alpine lakes, studies of Langa Co help to gain insights into lake thermal processes and thermoregulation mechanisms and establish a reference for lake model evaluation and parameterization on the Tibetan Plateau.

The lake is at an elevation of 322 m with a surface area of 275 ha and a maximum depth of 19.8 m. Many of the inlet streams and springs are influenced by hydrothermal fluids. In the vicinity of inlet streams and springs influenced by hydrothermal fluids, the near lake surface increased in temperature, conductivity, trace elements, and periphyton biomass, and decreased in pH and dissolved oxygen. For the whole lake, water quality and trace element concentrations were influenced to a lesser degree by the hydrothermal inputs. Bright orange precipitates deposited in the lake at the mouths of hydrothermal springs during winter were periodically suspended by easterly winds greater than 25 km/hr between ice-out and late july, changing the lake color to olive green. The precipitates settled slowly during calm periods. The supply of precipitates for suspension diminished by the end of July. By mid-August, Secchi disk clarity increased to a summer maximum, and the color of the lake turned blue-green. The phytoplankton community included 22 taxa dominated numerically by cyanobacteria-Chlorophyll was low in concentration. The maximum concentration of chlorophyll was associated with a decrease of Secchi disk clarity in late August. The zooplankton community included three crustacean species and nine rotifer species. Polyarthra and Bosmina were the most abundant zooplankters, reaching their peak densities in mid-summer when Secchi disk clarity and chlorophyll concentrations were increasing. All other zooplankton taxa were at their highest densities in either early or late summer. The bottom fauna was dominated by oligochaetes near the mouths of the hydrothermally influenced streams and springs, while Stictochironomus and oligochaetes dominated littoral areas near cold springs. A mid-depth group was dominated by Sphaeriids and oligochaetes. Sphaeriids and chironomid pupae dominated the deep lake.																			0003-9136					AUG	1993	128	1					13	38																WOS:A1993LX70100002
J	Haidary, A; Nakane, K				Haidary, A.; Nakane, K.			Comparative Study of Nitrogen Dynamics of Three Wetlands in the Higashi-Hiroshima Area, Western Japan	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												In a watershed, wetlands may function either as a nutrient sink or as a source and net transformer of nutrients. One of the most widely recognized functions of wetlands is the ability to reduce or remove nutrients from surface water passing through the wetland. In order to compare nitrogen retention capacity, we investigated the ability of three wetlands to reduce or remove dissolved nitrogen from the surface water that passed through them. Although the three wetlands were located within one watershed, their Surrounding land uses were significantly different. In this study, the surface water of each of the three wetlands was sampled from five points (the main inlet, outlet and three points inside the wetland) during the second week of every month, from December 2005 to December 2006, in order to measure dissolved nitrogen concentrations and their components (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen). During the growing season (June-July), a vegetation census was conducted in each wetland that included an estimation of the percent of coverage and a survey of the diversity of vegetation. Investigation into the seasonality of the source or sink function indicated that wetland A had a source-role in three seasons (winter, spring, and summer) and a sink role during the autumn season. Wetland B had a sink-role during two seasons (winter and summer), a source-role in the spring, and a neutral role in autumn. Wetland C had a sink-role for dissolved nitrogen in surface water during all seasons of the study period. Results from the vegetation census indicated that Typha latifolia was the dominant species for wetland A, Potamogeton cristatus was dominant for wetland B, and Ischene globosa was dominant for wetland C. The percentage of vegetation cover was estimated as 83%, 35%, and 53% in wetlands A, B, and C, respectively. The results of this study indicated that the surrounding land use and human alterations to the environment had played a significant role in determining the function of each wetland as a sink, source or transformer for dissolved nitrogen in surface water passing through the wetlands. It emerges from this study that the seasonal changes in the function of the wetland for dissolved nitrogen as well as variations in vegetation cover (%) and dominant plant species, were affected by the composition of the surrounding lands. This study revealed not only that the role (as Source, sink or transformer) that the wetland plays for dissolved nitrogen might change because of the above-mentioned factors, but also that this role could either be stable, or that it could change seasonally. Finally, an investigation of the components of total dissolved nitrogen in these three wetlands showed that under the influence of the surrounding land use, NH4+ was the dominant form in wetland A (with a high percentage of urban area), and (NO3-+NO2-) were sub-dominant in wetland B (with a high percentage of agricultural area). Dissolved organic nitrogen was the dominant form in wetland C (with 0% of urban area and a high percentage of forest area). According to the results, dissolved organic nitrogen was not always the dominant component of the dissolved nitrogen, so that with an increase in the percentage of urban area, DIN was the dominant form and vice versa. Based on the results, the retention capacity of the wetlands for dissolved nitrogen in surface water increased in conjunction with a decrease in the level of urban land use.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2009	18	4					617	626																WOS:000269173500013

Three-dimensional simulation of lake and ice dynamics during winter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An ice-formation algorithm is implemented in the three-dimensional Estuary and Lake Computer Model, to allow simulation of hydrodynamics and the thermal structure beneath the ice during winter. The one-dimensional governing equation of heat conduction among the three layers of white ice, blue ice, and snow is solved for the formation of ice cover considering the heat flux through air and water. This algorithm is applied independently in each grid cell within the simulation domain, allowing for spatially variable ice formation. The model was validated against observed data from both a large and a small Canadian mid-latitude lake (Lake Ontario and Harmon Lake, respectively). The lake surface temperature and the distribution and thickness of ice cover on Lake Ontario were predicted successfully during the 2006-2007 winter period. The model also accurately simulated spring 2007 temperature profiles, as typically used for the initial conditions for a summer simulation. The variation of ice and snow thickness, and vertical temperature profiles, were well-simulated for Harmon Lake during winter 1990-1991. These comparisons demonstrate the applicability of the model for year-round simulation of mid-latitude lakes of varying size.																			0024-3590					JAN	2012	57	1					43	57		10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0043	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0043													WOS:000298321300004

The study area is part of an orogenically active region along the northwestern collision zone of Indian-Eurasian plates. During spring and summer suspended sediment load is highest, but least in winter. Sediment load of all rivers studied is directly proportional to the melting of glaciers and/or high rainfall during spring and summer. Glacier melt, rainfall, lithology of rocks (shale, slate, phyllite, mudstone, and siltstone), discharge, and other anthropogenic factors caused the high suspended load in rivers. Mostly the fine sediments settle during winter due to flow velocity of rivers reducing appreciably and residence time of water increasing in reservoirs. The high sediment influx deposition in major reservoirs like the Terbella and Warsak, etc. reduces their storage capacity as well as power generation capacity. So it is proposed that life span of these reservoirs can be lengthened by the construction of small check dams (silt control dams) on upstream, dam cleaning tactics, effective watershed management, extensive afforestation on the steep mountain slopes upstream of the lake, and the use of runoff rivers for electricity generation using steep gradient and fast flow velocity.

The environmental reconstruction was used to evaluate hypotheses that address spatial variations in the Holocene climate of mountainous regions. Loon Lake lies within the summer-dry/winter-wet climate regime. An increase in xerophytic pollen taxa suggests drier-than-present conditions between ca. 9500 and 5500 C-14 yr B.P. This response is consistent with the hypothesis that increased summer radiation and the expansion of the east Pacific subtropical high-pressure system in the early Holocene intensified summer drought at locations within the summer-dry/winter-wet regime. This climate history contrasts with that of nearby sites in the summer-wet/winter-dry region, which were under the influence of stronger summer monsoonal circulation in the early Holocene. The Loon Lake record implies that the location of contrasting climate regimes did not change in the Yellowstone region during the Holocene. The amplitude of the regimes, however, was determined by the intensity of circulation features and these varied with temporal changes in the seasonal distribution of solar radiation.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface waters of Rackevei-Soroksari Danube Branch, Hungary	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the surface waters of Rdckevei-Soroks ri Danube (RSD) branch, Hungary were determined at ten sites during eight sampling events from October 2002-April 2004. Low and medium molecular weight PAHs (2-4 rings) varied from a few ng/L to hundreds of ng/L while high molecular weight PAHs (5-6 rings) were present at much lower concentrations (< 0.5-31 ng/L). Generally, concentrations of most of the individual PAHs were not significantly different (p > 0.05) during the different seasons. Concentrations of anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were significantly lower (P < 0.005) in the winter month whereas concentrations of benzo(a) anthracene, chrysne, and benzo(b)fluoranthene were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the fall season. Possible causes of such distribution in the surface waters of RSD include nature of the inputs of organic matter and different systems of winds or rains of the seasons. Of the total PAHs, the 2-3-ring PAHs contributed to about 78% while 4-6-ring PAHs accounted for 22%. This suggests that the incomplete combustion of fossil hydrocarbons may be the predornainate source of PAHs in surface water of RSD. Seasonally, petroleum and heavy fuel combustion were main sources of PAHs in summer and winter seasons, respectively. However, both sources contribute to PAHs in the spring season.

J	Kitlasten, W; Fogg, GE				Kitlasten, Wes; Fogg, Graham E.			Hydrogeology of a groundwater sustained montane peatland: Grass Lake, California	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Persistently wet conditions are essential to prevent the decomposition of organic material that forms peatlands. Wetlands in areas with a snow-melt dominated precipitation regime and little or no summer precipitation often rely on groundwater to meet late-season water requirements. Past and predicted changes in climate for the Sierra Nevada show a trend towards more winter precipitation falling as rain rather than snow. This is expected to result in reduced late-season water availability and the subsequent degradation of peatlands. Measurements of groundwater levels, stream flow, specific conductance, and peat water retention characteristics are used to quantify aspects of the hydrologic system that supports Grass Lake, south of Lake Tahoe California, the largest peatland in the Sierra Nevada. Water budget calculations using periodic measurements collected throughout the growing season show that groundwater discharge is a significant component of the water balance in the late-summer and fall. Late-season evapotranspiration needs were approximately balanced by groundwater inflow for 2010 (average water year). Groundwater discharge to the peatland dominated the late-season water budget in 2011 (above average water year) and persisted into October. Water retention experiments and field data suggest desaturation of the peatland accounts for approximately 0.5 mm day(-1), or roughly 10 % of the estimated evapotranspiration rate.					; Fogg, Graham/AAG-9504-2021	Kitlasten, Wes/0000-0002-2049-9107; 													0923-4861	1572-9834				OCT	2015	23	5					827	843		10.1007/s11273-015-9422-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-015-9422-6													WOS:000361630800005
J	Juhász, A; Majoros, G				Juhasz, Alexandra; Majoros, Gabor			A proposed ectochory of Galba truncatula snails between wallow sites enhances transmission of Fascioloides magna at gemenc, in Hungary	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE												Each year temporary puddles are formed on compacted earth roads as a consequence of heavy rains and subsequent flooding in the large floodplain forests of the Danube River, Hungary, Central Europe, Hungary. After the receding of floodwaters, the muddy puddles persist from spring to mid-fall, where they are densely populated by Galba truncatula snails on an annual basis. These snails are the sole intermediate host of Fascioloides magna liver fluke of deer in the forest. According to field observations, G. truncatula is a very rare species on banks of river branches and lakes within the forest but always appears in large aggregations in these semi-natural potholes. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) leave their droppings in puddles while they wallow in the mud, therefore the snails encounter the miracidia of F. magna frequently. Snails are not able to dig themselves into the tamp soil of roads therefore they are destroyed by the wheels of vehicles which drive down the roads from autumn to the end of winter. Therefore, snails colonize these puddles regularly every spring. Since there is no connection between the distant puddles, it is supposed that deer and wild boars repeatedly introduce the snails into the puddles each year carrying snails with the help of mud, which is stuck on their fur while they wallow. This method of transport is supported by the fact that shell remnants of snails can be found on the bark of rubbing trunks situated nearby wallows. It seems that the sequential creation of wallow sites and the repeated introduction of G. truncatula enhance the likelihood for the trematode to infect both hosts.

J	Johnson, JH				Johnson, James H.			Seasonal habitat use of brook trout and juvenile Atlantic Salmon in a tributary of Lake Ontario	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The seasonal habitat use of Salvelinus fontinalis (Brook Trout) and sub-yearling Salmo salar (Atlantic Salmon) was examined in Hart Brook, a tributary of Lake Ontario. Fish habitat use and available habitat were examined during summer and autumn. Interspecific differences in habitat use occurred as well as intraspecific seasonal differences. Overyearling Brook Trout were more selective in their habitat preferences than subyearling Brook Trout or Juvenile Atlantic Salmon. Depth and the amount of cover were significantly different among the three fish groups. Salmon occupied faster and shallower water than either age group of trout. Atlantic Salmon were also associated with larger-sized substrate materials than either trout age group, and salmon occurred in habitats with less cover than trout. Overyearling Brook Trout occupied deeper water with more cover than subyearling trout. All three salmonid groups occupied areas with more cover in autumn compared to summer. In autumn, subyearling Brook Trout used deeper areas than they had in the summer. In Hart Brook, the habitat of subyearling Atlantic Salmon can be generally characterized as riffles, the habitat of overyearling Brook Trout was deep pools with extensive cover (35%), and that of subyearling trout was any area with moderate flow and at least 20% cover. As efforts proceed to reintroduce Atlantic Salmon in Lake Ontario, further research is needed to ensure the conservation of Brook Trout populations.																			1092-6194						2008	15	3					363	374		10.1656/1092-6194-15.3.363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194-15.3.363													WOS:000259848400004
J	Simon, J				Simon, Janek			Do glass eels restocked in winter have a lower survival rate than glass eels restocked in spring?	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The critical status of the catadromous European eel is addressed with European wide conservation efforts. One option is conservation-oriented restocking where juvenile glass eels are caught upon their arrival at the European continent and transferred to waters with no or limited natural recruitment caused in part by fragmented migration routes. In light of the critical stock status, conservation oriented restocking activities needs to be conducted in a careful and informed manner. Due to warmer winters and better glass eel availability, glass eels have increasingly been restocked in Germany during winter in recent years, and not as usual in spring. However, it is not known if restocking in winter reduces glass eel survival due to colder temperatures and limited food availability compared to the traditional restocking approach. In this study, growth and survival rates for glass eels restocked in winter were estimated in five isolated lakes. The generated data were compared to values of a previous study where glass eels were restocked in the same lakes during spring. This comparison indicates that glass eels restocked in winter had similar survival rates (19-45%) and growth performance to those released in spring. Accordingly, restocking glass eels in the winter is a suitable alternative compared to traditional release in spring.

J	MCLELLAN, BN; HOVEY, FW				MCLELLAN, BN; HOVEY, FW			THE DIET OF GRIZZLY HEARS IN THE FLATHEAD RIVER DRAINAGE OF SOUTHEASTERN BRITISH-COLUMBIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Based on the analysis of 1100 feces or seats, the seasonal diet of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Flathead drainage between 1979 and 1991 was estimated. In the early spring, major foods included ungulates and hedysarum roots (Hedysarum sulphurescens). Later in the spring and early summer, green vegetation that mainly included horsetails (Equisetum arvense), graminoids, and cow parsnip (Heracleum lanatum) dominated the diet. Later in the summer, berries, particularly huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) and soopolallie (Shepherdia canadensis), were most common. In the autumn, berries, ungulates, and hedysarum roots were major foods. Seasonal changes in nutrients were measured for major foods. The volume of a food consumed within a season was inversely related to food quality, suggesting that food availability and handling time may have been more important factors influencing diet selection. The proportions of food items in the seats, and species of fruit in particular, varied among years. The Flathead and contiguous Waterton Lakes National Park are so far the only study areas in North America that contain all major bear foods found across the interior of the continent, and in particular, both major berry species, huckleberries and soopolallie. This observation supports the hypothesis that a favourable food base in the Flathead is partially responsible for the high density of bears found there. It is important for managers to realize the possible uniqueness of the Flathead area and not extrapolate information without due caution.																			0008-4301					APR	1995	73	4					704	712		10.1139/z95-082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z95-082													WOS:A1995RJ47600011

Therefore, a seasonal survey of planktonic bacterial and archaeal community compositions and related environmental factors was conducted in 16 cascade reservoirs and corresponding river waters on the Wujiang River and the Pearl River in southwest China to understand the above mechanisms.ResultsDeterministic processes dominated bacterial and archaeal community assembly. The structural equation models showed that water temperature can directly or indirectly affect the microbial diversity. Interestingly, planktonic bacterial diversity increased with increasing water temperature, while archaea showed the opposite trend; the overall diversity of bacteria and archaea was no significant changes with changeable water temperature. Abundant microbes had a stronger distance-decay relationship than middle and rare ones, and the relationship was stronger in winter and spring than in summer and autumn.ConclusionsPlanktonic bacteria and archaea in dammed rivers had different biogeographic distributions, and water temperature was a key controlling factor. The different responses of planktonic bacterial and archaeal diversity to water temperature could be due to their different phylogenetic diversity. This ultimately maintained the stability of total microbial community diversity. This study reveals the different responses of planktonic bacteria and archaea to water temperature and perfects the theoretical framework for planktonic microbial biogeography in dammed rivers.

Spring, summer, and fall CPUEs were modeled separately. In all seasons combined, CPUEs were over 2.5 times greater for lake trout than for burbot, and lake trout CPUEs were greater than burbot CPUEs in five of six regions of the lake. The hypothesized sources of variability in log(e)(CPUE) included lake region, depth (either as a linear [depth only] or a quadratic [depth and depth(2) included] relationship), number of nights out that the nets fished (also as either a linear or quadratic relationship), and the possibility that the effects of depth could vary among regions. The models predicted 57-68% of the variation in lake trout CPUE and 29-37% of the variation in burbot CPUE (log scales). Lake region was highly significant for both species in all seasons. In all seasons, the relationship between lake trout log(e)(CPUE) and depth was quadratic and varied among regions. For lake trout we did not find any effects of number of nights out. Burbot log(e)(CPUE) varied linearly with depth and with nights out in the spring. In the summer, log(e)(CPUE) for burbot varied linearly with nights out, and its relationship with depth was quadratic and varied among regions. In the fall, quadratic relationships between burbot log(e)(CPUE) and depth again differed among regions, but there was no relationship with nights out.

In this study, an inflow river system of the Baiyangdian???Fuhe river system (FRS) was investigated to display timely pollution patterns of eutrophication and heavy metals after the establishment of Xiongan New Area, aiming to reveal the weak parts in current pollution treatments and guide the further water quality management. The results showed that the pollution of eutrophication was worse than the heavy metals in FRS, with serious eutrophic parameters of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). There were greatly spatiotemporal variations of the pollution in FRS. (1) Concentrations of NH4+-N and total phosphorus were all higher in summer and autumn, whereas, COD contents were higher in spring; the water quality index (WQI) of eutrophication linearly increased along FRS in summer and autumn, with pollution hotspots around the estuary area. (2) The pollution levels of plumbum exceeded cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) but without strongly spatiotemporal changes; however, Cd and Cr in the town area and Cd in spring showed higher concentrations; the WQI of heavy metals showed single peak curves along FRS, with significantly higher values around the town area. Additionally, the four potential pollution sources: domestic sewage, traffic pollution, agricultural wastewater and polluted sediments were identified based on the pollution patterns and pollutant associations. These findings demonstrated current treatments failed to eliminate the pollution in some hotspots and periods, and the in-depth understanding of the pollution spatiotemporal patterns in this study, especially the pollution hotspots, serious periods and potential sources, are crucial to furtherly develop spatiotemporally flexible pollution treatment strategies.

Controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms in a hyper-eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China): The need for a dual nutrient (N & P) management strategy	WATER RESEARCH												Harmful cyanobacterial blooms, reflecting advanced eutrophication, are spreading globally and threaten the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems. Increasingly, non-nitrogen (N-2)-fixing cyanobacteria (e.g., Microcystis) dominate such blooms, indicating that both excessive nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads may be responsible for their proliferation. Traditionally, watershed nutrient management efforts to control these blooms have focused on reducing P inputs. However, N loading has increased dramatically in many watersheds, promoting blooms of non-N-2 fixers, and altering lake nutrient budgets and cycling characteristics. We examined this proliferating water quality problem in Lake Taihu, China's 3rd largest freshwater lake. This shallow, hyper-eutrophic lake has changed from bloom-free to bloom-plagued conditions over the past 3 decades. Toxic Microcystis spp. blooms threaten the use of the lake for drinking water, fisheries and recreational purposes. Nutrient addition bioassays indicated that the lake shifts from P limitation in winter-spring to N limitation in cyanobacteria-dominated summer and fall months. Combined N and P additions led to maximum stimulation of growth. Despite summer N limitation and P availability, non-N-2 fixing blooms prevailed. Nitrogen cycling studies, combined with N input estimates, indicate that Microcystis thrives on both newly supplied and previously-loaded N sources to maintain its dominance. Denitrification did not relieve the lake of excessive N inputs. Results point to the need to reduce both N and P inputs for long-term eutrophication and cyanobacterial bloom control in this hyper-eutrophic system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Climate effects on population fluctuations of the white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												P>1. Climate change may have profound consequences for many organisms. We have studied fluctuations in a population of the white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus during 31 years (1978-2008) in a river system in southern Norway in relation to both large-scale and local weather conditions occurring during the non-breeding season. 2. Multiple regression and partial least squares regression were used to model the growth rate of the population, accounting for population size in the previous year. 3. Population growth was influenced by North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), mean winter temperature, precipitation and timing of ice formation on the main lake in the river system in autumn. These variables explained 84% of the variation in population growth over the 31 -year study period. 4. Local winter conditions played a prominent role in explaining the population fluctuations, which is plausible because the dipper depends on open water for foraging. In the study area, winters can be harsh and rivers and lakes may freeze and severely affect the subsequent population size of the dipper in spring. 5. The breeding population of the dipper does not seem yet to have reached a level where all possible territories in the area have been occupied, even after mild winters, and the estimated carrying capacity is also decidedly lower (66 breeding pairs) than the number of available territories. If the trend of milder winters continues, the population might increase in the future. However, strong climate variation is expected to continue in the future, and hence periods of rapid growth of the dipper population will probably be followed by severe declines.					; Stenseth, Nils Christian/G-5212-2016; Stenseth, Nils/G-5212-2016	Nilsson, Anna/0000-0002-5609-4988; Stenseth, Nils Christian/0000-0002-1591-5399; 													0021-8790	1365-2656				JAN	2011	80	1					235	243		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01755.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01755.x								20880020					WOS:000285110600023

Intercomparison of Dynamically and Statistically Downscaled Climate Change Projections over the Midwest and Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Downscaling of global climate model (GCMs) simulations is a key element of regional-to-local-scale climate change projections that can inform impact assessments, long-term planning, and resource management in different sectors. We conduct an intercomparison between statistically and dynamically downscaled GCMs simulations using the hybrid delta (HD) and the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) Model, respectively, over the Midwest and Great Lakes region to 1) validate their performance in reproducing extreme daily precipitation (P) and daily maximum temperature (T-max) for summer and winter and 2) evaluate projections of extremes in the future. Our results show the HD statistical downscaling approach, which includes large-scale bias correction of GCM inputs, can reproduce observed extreme P and T-max reasonably well for both summer and winter. However, raw historical WRF simulations show significant bias in both extreme P and T-max for both seasons. Interestingly, the convection-permitting WRF simulation at 4-km grid spacing does not produce better results for seasonal extremes than the WRF simulation at 12 km using a parameterized convection scheme. Despite a broad similarity for winter extreme P projections, the projected changes in the future summer storms are quite different between downscaling methods; WRF simulations show substantial increases in summer extreme precipitation, while the changes projected by the HD approach exhibit moderate decreases overall. The WRF simulations at 4 km also show a pronounced decoupling effect between seasonal totals and extreme daily P for summer, which suggests that there could be more intense summer extremes at two different time scales, with more severe individual convective storms combined with longer summer droughts at the end of the twenty-first century.

J	Vrede, K				Vrede, K			Nutrient and temperature limitation of bacterioplankton growth in temperate lakes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Limitation of bacterioplankton production by nutrients and temperature was investigated in eight temperate lakes in summer. Six of the lakes were resampled in autumn. The lakes differ in nutrient content, water color, and concentration of dissolved organic carbon. Nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, and organic carbon) were added alone and in all possible combinations to filtered lake water inoculated with bacteria from the lake. After incubation for 36-40 h at in situ temperatures (ranging from 7 to 20 degrees C), the response in bacterioplankton production was determined. The effect of increased temperature on bacterioplankton growth was also tested. Bacterioplankton production was often limited by phosphorus alone, organic carbon alone, or the two in combination. Phosphorus limitation of bacterioplankton production was more common in the summer, whereas limitation by organic carbon was more frequently observed in the autumn. There was a close balance between limitation by phosphorus and organic carbon in the epilimnion in the summer. In the hypolimnion in the summer, bacterioplankton growth was primarily phosphorus-limited. The effect of phosphorus additions decreased with increasing phosphorus concentrations in the lakes. However, there were no correlations between the effect of added organic carbon and water color, dissolved organic carbon concentration, or phosphorus concentration. When temperature was low (in the hypolimnion in the summer, and throughout the water column in the autumn) temperature also limited bacterioplankton production. Thus, temperature and inorganic nutrients or organic compounds can limit bacterioplankton growth both alone and simultaneously. However, at low temperatures, temperature is the most important factor influencing bacterioplankton growth.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2005	49	2					245	256		10.1007/s00248-004-0259-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-004-0259-4								15965720					WOS:000230310200007

Viability of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens in the cold and dark, related to over-winter survival and summer recruitment in Lake Zurich	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Over the winter many phytoplankton in deep lakes encounter prolonged periods of dark and cold. Survival times of the planktonic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens were assessed by isolating single filaments of six strains in separate tubes that were stored at 4-5 degrees C in the dark for 2-16 weeks and then incubating them at 20 degrees C in the light. Viable filaments grew to produce cultures, usually within 3-5 weeks. Filaments survived for longer in isolation than they did in samples of cultures containing many filaments. After 8 weeks in the cold and dark, five of the Planktothrix strains had viable filaments, with 14-67% of filaments sampled surviving. In the most long-lived of these, Planktothrix strain 9736, 50% of the isolated filaments survived for 10 weeks and the maximum survival time exceeded 11 weeks. Combining this information with information on filament floating velocities, it is calculated that filaments would float up 25 m before half of them lost viability. Such calculations can be used in estimating the proportion of the lake population that can be recruited to the spring and summer populations in the metalimnion.

Using the same data on the predation effect of cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo on the grayling Thymallus thymallus population located in the river Rhine below Lake Constance, Staub et al. (1992) and Suter (1995) reached contradictory conclusions (additional and compensatory mortality, respectively). This comment clarifies the reasons for the differences. 2. The biomass of older fish (age classes 4 and 5-7) was not judged to be decreasing by Suter because of the use of inappropriate (parametric) inferential statistics and no use of power analysis. More powerful (non-parametric) inferential tests show a significant decrease in biomass, 3. Staub cr nl. compared fish numbers per length class in the angling catch (autumn) and in the spawning catch (spring). Differences were thought to be the effect of cormorant predation during winter. Suter converted fish numbers per length class into biomass per age class for the same comparisons. However, this conversion considered neither the length increase of grayling during winter (c. 1 cm) nor the dominance of faster growing males (> 1.5 cm longer than females of the same age) in the spawning catch. Thus, changes of the age pyramid during winter have been masked.

The results demonstrated that the DOC concentration in Poyang Lake had a range of 1.34-5.56 mg/L with an average of 2.12 +/- 0.54 mg/L. The absorption coefficient of CDOM at 355 nm had a range of 1.24-5.70 m(-1) with an average of 2.71 +/- 0.83 m(-1). In terms of the spatial distribution, the concentrations of DOC and CDOM in the south of Poyang Lake were higher than those in the north of the lake. In terms of seasonal variations, the concentrations of DOC and CDOM were higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. The absorption coefficients of CDOM and DOC concentrations in Poyang Lake exhibited a significant linear correlation. The correlation between DOC and CDOM in some sections of Poyang Lake varied spatially and seasonally. The highest correlation was observed in wetland waters of the southern Poyang Lake in spring, while there was no significant correlation in northern section of the lake in most of the periods. The results revealed that water level, precipitation and the vegetation cover pattern had determining effects on the spatial heterogeneity of DOC and CDOM. The spectral characteristic parameters demonstrated that the main source of the CDOM in Poyang Lake was from terrestrial input.					; Xu, Jian/NWG-9780-2025	Xu, Jian/0000-0002-9419-9502; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2023	82	1							44	10.1007/s12665-022-10736-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10736-8													WOS:000906732000002
J	PHILLIPS, PJ; SHEDLOCK, RJ				PHILLIPS, PJ; SHEDLOCK, RJ			HYDROLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF GROUNDWATER AND SEASONAL PONDS IN THE ATLANTIC COASTAL-PLAIN IN DELAWARE, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The hydrochemistry of small seasonal ponds was investigated by studying relations between groundwater and surface water in a forested Coastal Plain drainage basin. Observation of changes in the water table in a series of wells equipped with automatic water-level recorders showed that the relation between water-table configuration and basin topography changes seasonally, and particularly in response to spring recharge. Furthermore, in this study area the water table is not a subdued expression of the land surface topography, as is commonly assumed. During the summer and fall months, a water-table trough underlies sandy ridges separating the seasonal ponds. and maximum water-table altitudes prevail in the sediments beneath the dry pond bottoms. As the ponds fill with water during the winter, maximum water-table altitudes shift to the upland-margin zone adjacent to the seasonal ponds. Increases in pond stage are associated with the development of transient water-table mounds at the upland-margin wells during the spring. The importance of small local-flow systems adjacent to the seasonal ponds also is shown by the similarities in the chemistry of the shallow groundwater in the upland margin and water in the seasonal ponds. The upland-margin and surface-water samples have low pH (generally less than 5.0), and contain large concentrations of dissolved aluminum (generally more than 100 mug l-1), and low bicarbonate concentrations (2 mg l-1 or less). In contrast, the parts of the surficial aquifer that do not experience transient mounding have higher pH and larger concentrations of bicarbonate. These results suggest that an understanding of the hydrochemistry of seasonally ponded wetlands requires intensive study of the adjacent shallow groundwater-flow system.																			0022-1694					JAN	1993	141	1-4					157	178		10.1016/0022-1694(93)90048-E	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(93)90048-E													WOS:A1993KK97000007
J	DESLOGES, JR				DESLOGES, JR			VARVE DEPOSITION AND THE SEDIMENT YIELD RECORD AT 3 SMALL LAKES OF THE SOUTHERN CANADIAN CORDILLERA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Lacustrine sediments deposited in three small glacier-fed lakes of the southern Canadian Cordillera are derived primarily from subglacial erosion and delivered via short proglacial streams or by direct melting and calving of cirque glaciers. Sediment transport and deposition during early summer is controlled by runoff-generated bottom currents and in the late summer through winter by settling from suspension. This forms distinct rhythmic laminations of silt and clay in distal lake areas. Cesium-137 content in all three lakes indicates that these are varve sediments. Time series of varve thickness covering the interval 1863 to present show distinct declines in sediment yield from 310 to less than 150 t km-2 a-1. The decline is related to sediment exhaustion following glacier retreat from Little Ice Age maxima and the opening of intervening sediment storage sites. Annual varve thickness is significantly related to fluctuations in summer or late summer temperature highlighting the importance of ice ablation, melt-water runoff, and sub-glacial sediment sources in controlling deposition rates. Singular climate events, such as autumn storms provide distinctive sedimentary signatures in the varve record. Reconstructed sediment yield for the Little Ice Age is as much as 100% greater than the average Holocene rate.																			0004-0851					MAY	1994	26	2					130	140		10.2307/1551776	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551776													WOS:A1994NN01500004

As one of the most important Ramsar Wetlands globally, the Poyang Lake floodplain wetland ecosystem is facing severe drought challenges due to the combined impacts of climate change and human activities. This study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP) and its responses to drought in the Poyang Lake wetland from 1986 to 2020, using a process-based ecological model integrated with refined wetland vegetation classification datasets. The results indicated that the intra-annual NPP for most vegetation types exhibited two peaks, and the annual NPP ranged from 222.7 to 736.3 gC/m2/yr. Spatially, the high annual NPP values occurred in the southern and western regions of the wetland, while low values were found in the northern and eastern regions. Over the past 35 years, annual NPP decreased with the slope - 10.4 gC/m2/yr2 across the entire wetland, with the most significant decline observed in the eastern region. Drought significantly altered NPP variability in the Poyang Lake wetland. Seasonal NPP slightly increased in spring and winter but decreased in summer and autumn during dry years. Specifically, the NPP declined by 57.2 % in the summer of dry years compared to that of normal years, causing annual NPP to decrease from 467.4 gC/m2/yr in normal years to 389.6 gC/m2/yr in dry years. Notably, the seasonal NPP of dominant communities, i.e., Phragmites australis-Triarrhena lutarioriparia, and Carex cinerascens, decreased by 77.8 and 114.5 gC/m2/yr in the summer of extreme drought and mild drought years, respectively, compared to normal years. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the response mechanisms of floodplain wetland vegetation to intensified droughts and accurately assessing regional carbon budgets.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2025	90								103268	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103268													WOS:001511474600001
J	TALLING, JF				TALLING, JF			COMPARATIVE SEASONAL-CHANGES, AND INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY AND STABILITY, IN A 26-YEAR RECORD OF TOTAL PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS IN 4 ENGLISH LAKE BASINS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Long-term sequences of total phytoplankton biomass are described and analysed in relation to environmental conditions and species composition. They are based on largely weekly sampling of mean concentrations of chlorophyll a ([Chl]) in the euphotic zones of four English lake basins over 26 years. More restricted sampling is used to illustrate the regulation of vertical distribution, and a comparison with several chemical indices of seston abundance. The seasonal variation of [Chl] is predominantly constructed from two peaks in spring and summer-autumn. These are separated by a universal and light-limited winter minimum that is accentuated in the deeper basins and a more variable early summer minimum to which diatom sedimentation, species replacement and grazing by Cladocera contribute. In some years or year-sequences additional peaks of varied origin may be interpolated ('frequency modulation'), especially in the shallower basins. Some variability of maxima with nutrient enrichment and particular species-crop failure or success (e.g. Ceratium spp.), and of minima with growth limitation, loss modes and species replacement, exists within and between basins ('amplitude modulation'). Depth-colonization is primarily controlled by restrictions on vertical mixing associated with the seasonal temperature/density stratification. Relative timings can be important for areal biomass development. Though [Chl] is mainly epilimnetic in summer, metalimnetic and hypolimnetic accumulations can also arise by growth in situ, flagellate migration, or sedimentation. Variations in the content of Chl below unit area, for entire lake column or euphotic zone, are less sensitive to trophic state than are mean euphotic concentrations because of compensating influences of morphometry and light penetration. Correspondences exist between temporal sequences of [Chl] and some chemical components of seston (C, N, reducing capacity), but ratios to P show much variation. Comparison is made with other observations of seasonal phytoplankton biomass, with reference to latitudinal influence and to proposed generalisations regarding seasonal pattern.																			0018-8158					SEP 24	1993	268	2					65	98		10.1007/BF00006879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006879													WOS:A1993MC25600001

Shifteh			Investigation of groundwater level fluctuations in the north of Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater is the main source of water supply for drinking and agriculture uses in Mazandaran province. In recent years, the rapid growth of population and the increased need for water and food has put its land and water resources under severe stress. The main objective of this study was to investigate the temporal trends in annual, seasonal and monthly groundwater level using the Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope estimator in the area during 1985-2007. The results indicated a mix of negative and positive trends in the groundwater level series. However, the positive trends were much more than negative ones. The statistical tests detected a significant increasing trend in more than 28% of the wells. The stronger increasing trends were identified in the series in summer and spring compared with those in autumn and winter. Moreover, the highest numbers of wells with significant positive trends occurred in August and July, respectively. The results of spatial analysis showed that the significant positive trends were concentrated in the central parts of Mazandaran province where paddy fields are the major water demanders. Analysis of climatic parameters revealed that decreasing trend of relative humidity and increasing trends of minimum and maximum air temperature can be attributed to groundwater level fluctuations in the study region. The research will be helpful for planners and policy makers to allocate groundwater resources in different sectors including agriculture, drinking and industry.

Here, their temporal distributions and their relationships with biogeochemical parameters are studied. Samples were collected at approximately 2-week intervals from two sites (A and B) during the period September 2012 to December 2013. The abundance of MMPs was high in summer and autumn, but low in winter and spring. Furthermore, the peaks in the numbers of the two types of MMPs were sequential, with the highest concentration of the spherical MMPs occurring prior to that of the ellipsoidal MMPs. This may be related to different optimal growth temperatures for the two types. Although the two types of MMP coexisted at both sites, their numbers were different; at most times, spherical MMPs dominated at site A, whereas ellipsoidal MMPs dominated at site B. Geochemical analysis revealed that the environmental conditions at site A varied more than at site B. Compared with the widely distributed spherical MMPs, ellipsoidal MMPs seemed to prefer more stable habitats. This is the first report of the temporal distribution of ellipsoidal MMPs in sediments, suggesting that their environmental adaptations differ from those of spherical MMPs.

Therefore Shanghai shifted the preferred freshwater source to the Yangtze Estuary and constructed the Qingcaosha Reservoir, which is subject to less eutrophic water from the Yangtze River. To assess the population of phytoplankton for the first time in the newly built reservoir, this study improved an integrated method to assess the phytoplankton pattern in large-water-area reservoirs and lakes, using partial triadic analysis and Geographic Information Systems. Monthly sampling and monitoring from 10 stations in the reservoir from July 2010 to December 2011 were conducted. The study examined the common pattern of the phytoplankton population structure and determined the differences in the specific composition of the phytoplankton community during the transition period of the reservoir. The results suggest that in all but three sampling stations in the upper parts of Qingcaosha Reservoir, there was a strong common compromise in 2011. The two most important periods occurred from late summer to autumn and from winter to early spring. The former was characterized by the dominance of cyanobacteria, whereas the latter was characterized by the dominance of both chlorophyta and diatoms. Cyanobacteria (Microcystis spp. as the main genus) were the monopolistic dominant species in the summer after reservoir operation. The statistical analysis also indicated the necessity for regular monitoring to focus on the stations in the lower parts of the reservoir and on several limited species.					; Zhou, Lili/J-5687-2016; Che, Yue/AGH-1786-2022; Yang, Kai/N-2550-2019	Ren, Xiangyu/0009-0003-6760-7202; Chen, Liqiao/0000-0003-0138-7828													2095-0195	2095-0209				SEP	2016	10	3					546	559		10.1007/s11707-015-0543-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-015-0543-2													WOS:000379077000012
J	Durner, GM; Amstrup, SC; Fischbach, AS				Durner, GM; Amstrup, SC; Fischbach, AS			Habitat characteristics of polar bear terrestrial maternal den sites in northern Alaska	ARCTIC												Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) give birth to and nurture their young in dens of ice and snow. During 19992001, we measured the structure of 22 dens on the coastal plain of northern Alaska after polar bear families had evacuated their dens in the spring. During the summers of 2001 and 2002, we revisited the sites of 42 maternal and autumn exploratory dens and recorded characteristics of the under-snow habitat. The structure of polar bear snow dens was highly variable. Most were simple chambers with a single entrance/egress tunnel. Others had multiple chambers and additional tunnels. Thickness of snow above and below dens was highly variable, but most dens were overlain by less than I in of snow. Dens were located on, or associated with, pronounced landscape features (primarily coastal and river banks, but also a lake shore and an abandoned oil field gravel pad) that are readily distinguished from the surrounding terrain in summer and catch snow in early winter. Although easily identified, den landforms in northern Alaska were more subtle than den habitats in many other parts of the Arctic. The structure of polar bear dens in Alaska was strikingly similar to that of dens elsewhere and has remained largely unchanged in northern Alaska for more than 25 years. Knowledge of den structure and site characteristics will allow resource managers to identify habitats with the greatest probability of holding dens. This information may assist resource, managers in preventing negative impacts of mineral exploration and extraction on polar bears.

Here we examine patterns of temporal foraging niche shifts of a generalist predator (yellow catfish, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) and the abundance of prey communities in a subtropical lake. We predicted that the nature of these interactions would have implications for patterns in diet shifts and growth of the predator. Our results show significant decreases in planktivory and benthivory from late spring to summer and autumn, whereas piscivory increased significantly from mid-summer until late autumn and also increased steadily with predator body length. The temporal dynamics in predator/prey ratios indicate that the predation pressure on zooplankton and zoobenthos decreased when the predation pressure on the prey fish and shrimps was high. Yellow catfish adjusted their foraging strategies to temporal changes in food availability, which is in agreement with optimal foraging theory. Meanwhile the decrease in planktivory and benthivory of yellow catfish enabled primary consumers, such as zooplankton and benthic invertebrates, to develop under low grazing pressure via trophic cascading effects in the local food web. Thus, yellow catfish shifts its foraging niche to intermediate consumers in the food web to benefit the energetic demand on growth and reproduction during summer, which in turn indirectly facilitate the primary consumers. In complex food webs, trophic interactions are usually expected to reduce the strength and penetrance of trophic cascades. However, our study demonstrates strong associations between foraging niche of piscivorous fish and abundance of prey. This relationship appeared to be an important factor in producing top-down effects on both benthic and planktonic food webs. Citation: Xu J, Wen Z, Gong Z, Zhang M, Xie P, et al.

This lake is the main source of drinking water in Iraq, providing water to Mosul, Baghdad, and other cities. The surface area of the lake is 385 km(2) at the maximum operation level with a total storage volume of 11.13 x 10(9) m(3). The climate of the study area is arid to semi arid, with rainfall not exceeding 300 mm/year. The highest temperature in summer reaches more than 55 degrees C. The lake is monomictic with overturn occurring in the autumn. The difference between the lake surface and bottom temperatures during the summer is more than 17 degrees C (31-14 degrees C) and 2 degrees C during winter (12-10 degrees C). Secchi disk measurements show that Mosul Dam Lake is mesotrophic; only the outlet of Dohuk River is eutrophic. In the current study, the standard plate count agar procedure was used for analyzing 45 samples for heterotrophic bacteria. These samples have been collected from different depths and locations in the study area during two sampling campaigns in February 2011 and July 2011. Water quality parameters (pH, EC, NO3, NO2, PO4, TIC, and DOC) for the same locations and depths of the sampled bacteria were measured. Results of heterotrophic bacteria analysis show that Mosul Dam Lake is contaminated with bacteria. The river Dohuk is the major source of this pollution. Occurrence of heterotrophic bacteria during the summer exceeds the winter values by 57%. In a layer located 12-15 m below the surface of the lake with a temperature of 10.9 degrees C, a linear correlation between heterotrophic bacteria and water quality parameters (R-2 >0.7) in winter could be observed. However, with respect to phosphorous, a logarithmic relationship with heterotrophic bacteria can be seen. In the summer season, the heterotrophic bacteria had a clear relation with most water quality parameters (R-2 >0.7) at depths of between 40 and 60 m within the hypolimnion zone (20-14 degrees C). Spatial analysis shows that the heterotrophic bacteria for bottom samples correlate (p < 0.05) with most water quality parameters for samples which have been taken from deep regions of the lake.					; Merkel, Broder/O-3237-2019; Khattab, Mohammed/V-1301-2019	Khattab, Mohammed/0000-0002-9138-2424; Merkel, Broder/0000-0002-6995-1176													1743-3541		978-1-84564-608-0				2012	164						195	207		10.2495/WP120171	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/WP120171													WOS:000345657500017

Weather conditions also play role on the body condition such as body mass and the deposited fat. In this study we selected four warbler species to examine the impact of different weather variables on their spring and autumn migration timing and their body condition in one of the most extreme weather areas of the Earth, at Lake Baikal in Siberia. We also studied the changes in body mass and fat reserves during the spring and autumn migration periods of these species. For the analyses, we used ringing data of 2471 birds from five spring and five autumn seasons during 2015-2019. According to our results, it can be stated that the weather did not have a significant association with the migration timing of the studied warblers, perhaps due to the geographical location of the study site. However, the body mass and the fat reserves of the birds increased during unsuitable weather conditions because of the increased energy requirements. Birds generally migrate with low fat reserves, which is due to the fact that this area is not an important stopover site for these species.																			0030-5685						2021	98	4					162	174																WOS:000738072200003

Stream rearing capacity and the potential for interspecific competition between resident 0+ brown and rainbow trout were assessed. The 0+ trout populations were dominated by rainbow trout with maximum density of rainbow fry being 7.7 fry m-2; whereas that of brown fry usually was less than 0.16 fry m-2. Observed loss of 0+ rainbow trout over much of the summer was constant whereas mortality increased. Loss for the first six months of life was c. 96%. Mean length at the end of the summer growing season (April) was c. 114 mm and 69 mm for 0+ brown and rainbow trout, respectively. Size-selective emigration for large fish affected observed growth of 0+ rainbow trout in the autumn and early winter. Maximum biomass of 0+ fish ranged between 19.2 .+-. 3.5 g m-2 and 26.0 .+-. 4.5 g m-2 over the three summers. Brown trout obtained a size advantage over rainbow trout through earlier emergence, but they were too few in number to exert a competitive influence over rainbow trout.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1988	22	2					169	179		10.1080/00288330.1988.9516289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1988.9516289													WOS:A1988R112900003

In 2011-2013, Daphnia population showed 1-2 density peaks from mid spring to early summer, it declined in July-August and did not recover, from ephippia, until the following spring. The seasonal dynamics was probably related to the species thermal tolerance. Males and ephippial females appeared at the beginning of growth season according to a typical feature of Daphnia populations from temporary habitats. The presence of the Chaoborus larvae resulted in juvenile adaptive predator-avoidance cyclomorphosis. In 2014, in the study area, mean winter air temperature was much warmer than average recorded during the past three years while it was much colder than average in July and August. This reflected the relatively rainy and cloudy summer months: the winter and summer precipitations total was above the previous three years average. In 2014, Daphnia was found all over the year and showed a maximum peak of density in November. The general increase of Daphnia was related to a shift in D. pulex population phenology, seasonal growth started earlier and lasted longer, and to the occurrence of D. longispina. Both species were identified by genetic markers and phylogenetic analyses of ND5 sequences placed isolates from the Bodrio del pastore III into the European D. pulex group. Both populations reproduced by cyclical parthenogenesis and showed cyclomorphosis. However, D. pulex produced more males and ephippial females than D. longispina. Their seasonal dynamics were quite different: D. longispina dominated in late summer while D. pulex showed the highest density in November. The presence of D. pulex in the Bodrio is important in the framework of conservation ecology especially because we have showed that it is native European strain instead of the invasive North American clone that replaced native D. pulex throughout Africa and was already recorded in Italy.

Indexing Age-0 Walleye Abundance in Northern Wisconsin Lakes before Fall	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Recruitment of age-0 WalleyeSander vitreusis often indexed using fall electrofishing surveys. However, collecting fish before fall may provide timely information regarding stocking decisions and factors influencing recruitment. We evaluated sampling methods for age-0 Walleye in northern Wisconsin lakes that could be used to assess recruitment in spring and summer. Initial assessments on two lakes indicated surface tows of ichthyoplankton nets at night during May to early June and 0.64-cm-micromesh gill nets set in July provided the highest catches of age-0 Walleye among the methods we evaluated. Additional sampling on 13 lakes over 2 years indicated catch per effort (CPE) of age-0 Walleye using these two methods did not correlate with age-0 CPE in fall electrofishing. However, presence or absence of age-0 Walleye in micromesh gill nets was 92% accurate in predicting whether age-0 CPE in fall electrofishing was >= 15 fish/h, the threshold above which eventual recruitment to the fishery is expected to occur. Micromesh gill netting may provide a useful tool for allocating fingerling Walleye that are stocked in fall, a resource that is often limited due to space and forage constraints associated with propagation. Additionally, our sampling protocol may help to identify timing of potential recruitment bottlenecks occurring in some lakes.					; Hansen, Gretchen/ABE-3860-2022	Boehm, Hadley/0000-0001-6738-5564; Hansen, Gretchen/0000-0003-0241-7048; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2020	40	4					910	921		10.1002/nafm.10452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10452		JUL 2020											WOS:000545348800001
J	RYAN, PM				RYAN, PM			LAKE USE BY WILD ANADROMOUS ATLANTIC SALMON, SALMO-SALAR, AS AN INDEX OF SUBSEQUENT ADULT ABUNDANCE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, were censused each spring and fall for 5 or 6 yr in two lakes at the headwaters of the Gander River, Newfoundland. Density, biomass, and age varied seasonally and annually, anging from 5.2 to 78.7 fish .cntdot. ha-1, 0.2 to 3.4 kg .cntdot. ha-1, and 1 to 7 yr, respectively. Seasonal changes in age composition were used to calculate net numbers and ages of fish moving into and out of the lakes. Population sizes typically increased from fall to spring as young fish moved into the lakes from downstream spawning areas and decreased from spring to fall as older fish moved downstream. The calculated net number of spring to fall emigrants over 6 yr was positively correlated (r = 0.835) with adult abundance (catch per unit effort) in the recreational fishery 1 yr later. The varying modal age of these emigrants was identical to the modal freshwater age of returning adults in each of four comparable years. Censusing of young Atlantic salmon in standing waters can be used to monitor smolt production and assist in prediction of the subsequent abundance of sea-run adults.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1986	43	1					2	11		10.1139/f86-001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-001													WOS:A1986AYV4700001

SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIFE CYCLE IN SPONGILLIDAE FROM OPEN LAKE BAIKAL	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The histological analysis of the tissue structure in different species of various Baikal sponges was performed. The material was collected at a depth of 3-4 m in Berezovyi test site (southern Lake Baikal) in different seasons of 2001-2003. During the whole year, representatives of the family Lubomirskiidae had a well-developed irrigation system with a large number of choanocyte chambers. In Trochospongilla sp. (Spongillidae) from open Baikal, such tissue pattern was observed only during summer time. Annually, these sponges undergo tissue regression that means a reduction of the irrigation system accompanied by changes in the cell composition in autumn with subsequent recovery in spring. The onset and termination of the tissue regression are adapted to the Baikal environment.

Biomarkers in European perch (Perca fluviatilis) liver from a metal-contaminated dam lake	BIOLOGIA												The present study was carried out in three seasons - spring, summer and autumn in Topolnitsa Dam Lake (Bulgaria) which has been subjected to continuous contamination with trace metals due to copper extraction in the area. We investigated the trace metal levels in surface water and liver samples of European perch (Perca fluviatilis L.). We also linked the metal levels we determined with the various histological and biochemical changes which we observed. Lesions in the liver parenchyma were found to be degenerative and necrotic, as well as, they were presented as hyperemia which consequently leads to disturbances in the hepatic blood circulation. Activities of the hepatic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) were found to be significantly elevated, particularly in summer. Therefore, based on our results we could recommend that the investigated tissue and cell alterations may be successfully applied as reliable biomarkers for monitoring polluted with a mixture of trace metals freshwater ecosystems.

Investigating potential fish habitats and periods of habitat stress is crucial for fisheries and the conservation of rare species, offering both economic and ecological benefits. This study employed a hydrodynamic model coupled with heat flux exchange to simulate the seasonal variations of water temperature in Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake. Using optimal water temperature ranges of dominant fish species in this large lake, we identified periods of fish habitat stress and mapped the spatial distribution in the number of optimal days. Our results reveal distinct spatial patterns in the seasonal distribution of water temperatures in Poyang Lake, such as significant temperature differences in spring and winter compared to smaller differences in summer and autumn, accompanied by a temperature gradient from southeast to northwest. Additionally, our simulations suggest that fish are more prone to habitat stress from December to March, with thermal stress occurring more frequently during this period. This research establishes a correlation between fish habitats and water temperatures in China's largest lake, which could provide essential information for fisheries management and the conservation of ecologically and economically important fish species.					孟, 定华/HKF-2844-2023; Tian, Mingming/KYO-8587-2024; Wang, Kang/GQZ-1120-2022; Chen, Yanhong/AAB-4452-2022														1936-0584	1936-0592				APR	2025	18	3							e70045	10.1002/eco.70045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.70045													WOS:001496228100008

Local spring warming drives earlier river- ice breakup in a large Arctic delta	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Pan-Arctic rivers strongly affect the Arctic Ocean and their vast lake-rich deltas. Their discharges may be increasing because of an intensifying hydrological cycle driven by warming climate. We show that a previously unexplained trend toward earlier ice breakup in the Mackenzie River Delta is little affected by winter warming during the period of river-ice growth and is unaffected by river discharge, but unexpectedly is strongly related to local spring warming during the period of river-ice melt. These results are statistically linked to declining winter snowfall that was not expected because of an intensifying Arctic hydrological cycle. Earlier ice breakup is expected to cause declining water level peaks that will reduce off-channel flows through the lake-rich delta before river waters enter the ocean. Thus, local spring warming with unexpected snowfall declines, rather than warmer winters, can drive earlier ice breakup in large Arctic rivers and biogeochemical changes in their river-ocean interface.

Male and female gametes were produced in cells below 55% of the maximum diameter during a 3-4-week period in late summer, following the return of nitrate concentrations above 10 muM NO3-N. The frequency of sexual reproduction was linked to the cycle of diameter size reduction and regeneration. The times of largest decreases in cell diameter were during nutrient stress in summer and low light conditions in late autumn, rather than during the main spring growth period. So, environmental conditions (combined with the limited life-spans of individual cells) affected the rate of diameter reduction and, therefore, the length of the life cycle (3-4 years).																			0022-3646					DEC	1992	28	6					856	866		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1992.00856.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1992.00856.x													WOS:A1992KH06800020

This is a naidid species that is not usually abundant in oligochaete communities. Its ecology and biology is poorly known and thus the aim of this study was to characterise the environmental conditions influencing the occurrence of R. parasita and to assess its population dynamics and life history pattern. R. parasita occurred in a pond with soft water and a low level of mineralisation, a pH ranging from 6.1 to 7.0, and a high content of nitrogen and phosphorus. During our investigation, considerable seasonal changes in the occurrence and population density were detected. Specimens of this species inhabited alder leaf deposits in winter and early spring while in summer and autumn they occupied in large number floating Nuphar lutea leaves. A stepwise regression analysis showed a relationship between the temperature and dissolved oxygen content in the water and the density of R. parasita. The R. parasita reproduced asexually by paratomy (between May and November). The mean doubling time (days) for the population was 22.4. Only a few individuals (less than 1% of the population) matured in September and October.

During MIS 6, 4, and 2, pinaceous conifer forests were present in both inland and Japan Sea coastal areas around Lake Biwa, influenced by cold and dry conditions in both summer and winter. In contrast, deciduous broadleaved forests and evergreen forests grew during interglacial periods in MIS 5e and 1 under relatively warm and humid conditions in summer, as well as in winter. Fagus crenata, a tree endemic to the Japanese archipelago, was especially widely distributed during MIS 5e due in part to winter snowfall caused by warm current inflows in the Sea ofJapan. During MIS 5 and 3, temperate conifer trees were dominant. During periods of low summer insolation in MIS 5, the endemic tree Cryptomeria japonica became dominant in both inland and coastal areas of the region, likely as a result of high precipitation in early summer related to southward shifts of the summer monsoon front and moderate winter climate conditions. In contrast, Sciadopitys verticillata, which is also an endemic tree, had own habitat around inland areas of western Japan during the periods of high summer insolation in MIS 5. Climate fluctuations during the glacial-interglacial cycles created several ecological niches in time and space for each endemic tree in the Japanese archipelago. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used in conjunction with the Mann-Kendall (MK) test in this study. This study also investigated the relationships between original precipitation and different periodic components of SPI series with datasets spanning 55 years (1960-2014). The results showed that with the exception of the annual and summer SPI in the Inner Mongolia Inland Rivers Basin (IMIRB), spring SPI in the Qinghai Lake Rivers Basin (QLRB), and spring SPI in the Central Asia Rivers Basin (CARB), it had an increasing trend in other regions for other time series. In the spring, summer, and autumn series, though the MK trends test in most areas was at the insignificant level, they showed an increasing trend in precipitation. Meanwhile, the SPI series in most subbasins of NWC displayed a turning point in 1980-1990, with the significant increasing levels after 2000. Additionally, there was a significant difference between the trend of the original SPI series and the largest approximations. The annual and seasonal SPI series were composed of the short periodicities, which were less than a decade. The MK value would increase by adding the multiple D components (and approximations), and the MK value of the combined series was in harmony with that of the original series. Additionally, the major trend of the annual SPI in NWC was based on the four kinds of climate indices (e.g., Atlantic Oscillation [AO], North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO], Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO], and El Nino-Southern Oscillation index [ENSO/NINO]), especially the ENSO.

The results lead to the conclusion that the nitrate concentrations in Taihu Lake are lower in summer than that in winter due to the dilution effect of wet deposition. In winter, sewage and manure were the primary nitrate sources in major inflow rivers and North Taihu Lake (NTL), while nitrate sources in East Taihu Lake (ETL) probably derived from soil organic N. In summer, atmospheric deposition and sewage/manure inputs appear to play an important role in controlling the distribution of nitrates in the whole lake. The delta O-18-NO3- values suggest that the nitrate produced from microbial nitrification is another major nitrate source during both winter and summer months. The variations in isotopic values in nitrate suggest denitrification enriched the heavier isotopes of nitrate in NTL in winter and in ETL in summer.

Although temperature fluctuations at different time scales have been extensively discussed, the research on week-scale STFs is lacking. In this study, we developed a method, that can quantify the amplitude and frequency of STFs by the thresholds from all years. We used this method to quantify the amplitude and frequency of the 7-d STFs from 1951 to 2019 across China. Our results indicate that the amplitude of the STF was much higher in the eastern part of China than in the western part, while the frequency of the STF was higher in the middle part than in the southern and northern parts; furthermore, the STF was highly dependent on internal factors such as topography. The long-term STF mainly showed a decreasing trend before 1990, which implies that temperature became increasingly stable from the 1950s to the 1990s. The main influencing factors were related to topography since the trends were relatively consistent in space. A case study in Taihu Lake showed that an unstable STF in winter and summer resulted in a smaller bloom area in the following spring and autumn. Our method could eliminate seasonal effects and is capable of analyzing STFs at scales ranging from days to years. Quantifications of the amplitude and frequency also make the STF indicators more comprehensive. Furthermore, the STF increased significantly across most of China after 1990, which implies that temperature is becoming increasingly unstable. The drivers of these STFs are related to human impacts since the trends are different in space.

Here, MODIS-Aqua level 3 chlorophyll-a data (2018-2021) were used to monitor trophic state in our planet's largest lake, that is, the Caspian Sea that accounts for approximately 40% of the total lacustrine waters on Earth. We also used the in situ measurements of chlorophyll-a data (2009-2019) to further verify the accuracy of the data derived from the MODIS-Aqua and to explore the deep chlorophyll-a maxima (DCMs) in the south Caspian Sea. Our findings show an acceptable agreement between the chlorophyll-a data derived from the MODIS-Aqua and those measured in situ in the coast of Iran (coefficient of determination = 0.71). The oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic states cover 66%, 20%, and 13% of the sea surface area, respectively. The DCMs are dominantly regulated by water transparency and they generally observe at depths of less than 20 and 30 m during the cold (autumn and winter) and warm (spring and summer) seasons, respectively. Our results suggest an ever-increasing chlorophyll-a in the shallow zones (i.e., coasts) and even in deep regions of the sea, mainly due to nutrient inputs from the Volga river delta. Alarming increase of chlorophyll-a in this transboundary lake can amplify eutrophication under the lens of global warming and further threaten the lake ecosystem's health, where almost all legal agreements have not yet been implemented to protect the lake environment and its rich resources.

As a whole, significant declines in TN, NO3--N, DON (dissolved organic nitrogen) and TP concentration in soil solution have occurred with increase of the depth, and reached their minima at 60 cm depth, except for NH4+-N, which increased with depth. The concentration of TP increased gradually from spring to winter in the topsoil, the maximum 0.08 mg/L presented in the winter while the minimum 0.03 mg/L in spring. In the deeper layer, the concentration value of TP fluctuated little. As for the NO3--N, its seasonal variation was significant at 20 cm depth, its concentration increased gradually from spring to autumn, and decreased markedly in winter. Vertical and temporal distribution of DON is contrary to that of NO3--N. The results also show that the variation of N and P in the percolate between adjacent layers is obviously different. The vertical variation of TN, TP, NO3--N, NH4+-N and DON is significant, of which the variation coefficient of NO3--N along the depth reaches 100.23%, the highest; while the variation coefficient of DON is 41.14%, the smallest. The results of correlation analysis show that the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus correlate significantly with TOC, ORP, root biomass and counts of nitrifying bacteria. Most nutrients altered much from 20 to 40 cm along the depth. However, DON changed more between 60 and 80 cm. Results show that soil of 0-60 cm depth is active rhizoplane, with strong capability to remove the nitrogen and phosphorus in ATE. It may suggest that there exists the optimum ecological efficiency in the depth of above 60 cm in reed wetland. This will be very significant for ecological restoration and reestablishment.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2007	19	6					689	695		10.1016/S1001-0742(07)60115-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(07)60115-6								17969641					WOS:000247251700010
J	Novaes, JLC; Carvalho, ED				Costa Novaes, Jose Luis; Carvalho, Edmir Daniel			FISHIN G RESOURCES ORIGINATED FROM OF THE ARTISANAL FISHING IN THE JURUMIRIM RESERVOIR, PARANAPANEMA RIVER, UPPER PARANA, BRAZIL	BOLETIM DO INSTITUTO DE PESCA												The aim of this paper was to evaluate the artisanal fisheries in the village of fishermen of Bairro da Ponte, Jurumirim reservoir. Data were collected using production forms which were filled daily by a data collector, in 2005 and 2006. The fishery yield was estimated at 15.7 kg ha(-1) year(-1), the average yield was 12.5 t year(-1) and catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 10.5 kg fisherman(-1) day(-1). We recorded 26 species of landed fish in this activity, being the "traira" (Hoplias malabaricus) the most landed fish in terms of biomass with 6,158.5 kg, representing 24.5%, of the total landed. Seasonally, the CPUE ranged from 14.5 kg fisherman(-1) day(-1) in summer/2005 to 9.0 kg fisherman(-1) day(-1) in spring/2006. The average CPUE by type of fish also showed a marked seasonality. In summer of 2005 and 2006, "curimbata" was the most landed fish, with CPUE kg fisherman(-1) day(-1) of 6.9 and 6.2, respectively. The "piavas" were the most landed fish in autumn with CPUE of 2.4 (year 2005) and 2.3 (year 2006) kg fisherman(-1) day(-1), and "traira" in winter with CPUE ranging from 3.0 to 4.0 kg fishrman(-1) day(-1), in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The mathematical modeling of simple linear regression indicated positive relationships between the monthly fish production and the number of boats in activity and of fishing trips. The study concluded that fishing is sustained only by native species; with marked seasonality for catching fish and that the area of fishing examined of the Jurumirim reservoir is among the most productive areas of the Upper Parana basin.

Here, we quantify the magnitude and controls of diffusive CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes from 20 agricultural reservoirs on seasonal and diel timescales. All gases exhibited consistent seasonal trends, with CO2 concentrations highest in spring and fall and lowest in mid-summer, CH4 highest in mid-summer, and N2O elevated in spring following ice-off. No discernible diel trends were observed for GHG content. Analyses of GHG covariance with potential regulatory factors were conducted using generalized additive models (GAMs) that revealed CO2 concentrations were affected primarily by factors related to benthic respiration, including dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), stratification strength, and water source (as delta O-18(water)). In contrast, variation in CH4 content was correlated positively with factors that favoured methanogenesis, and so varied inversely with DO, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and conductivity (a proxy for sulfate content), and positively with DIN, DOC, and temperature. Finally, N2O concentrations were driven mainly by variation in reservoir mixing (as buoyancy frequency), and were correlated positively with DO, SRP, and DIN levels and negatively with pH and stratification strength. Estimates of mean CO2-eq flux during the open-water period ranged from 5,520 mmol m(-2) year(1) (using GAM-predictions) to 10,445 mmol m(-2) year(-1) (using interpolations of seasonal data) reflecting how extreme values were extrapolated, with true annual flux rates likely falling between these two estimates.

The drought has been investigated through change detection using Multispectral (MSI) PlanetScope remote sensing data between 2017 and 2022. Changes in wetlands, moist regions, swamps, agricultural areas, and drought over the summer and winter were observed using the normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) indices applied to mosaic data. The findings of the temporal variation over the summer and winter seasons are displayed as pixel -based spatial variations. The analysis used surface temperature, monthly temperature change tables, and precipitation maps for the years operated in the study. According to the research, the wetlands, which comprised 5% of the total surface area in the summer of 2020, were prevented from drying out entirely by the usual wet winters of 2021 and 2022.

We simulated food falls using freshly killed fish during two different seasons (spring and summer) in the littoral zone of a large, pre-alpine meso-oligotrophic lake in central Europe (Lake Constance, Germany). This study provides evidence that input in the form of fish carcasses may play an important role in nutrient dynamics within this ecosystem The benthic communities in the vicitinity and underneath the food fall were strongly influenced by the food fall. The results show that this supply of organic matter has a significant influence on the relationships within the communities, which are clearly dominated by bacteria, followed by copepod naupln, cyclopoid copepods, chironomids, and ostracods. Total decomposition was obtained between days 80 and 68 of the experiments The food fall had a positively but not significant effect on mciofaunal assemblages in these experiments Furthermore, the results showed a negative relationship between bacteria and meiofauna abundance, indicating grazing by the meiobenthos on the bacterial community. These findings support other studies that found that the meiofauna exerted a grazing pressure on the microbial community, where this process was important in the decomposition of carcasses. Moreover, this study shows the potential importance of fish carcasses in Lake Constance, where food falls may generate high abundances and diversity of the benthic fauna and support high bacterial activities in this littoral ecosystem.					; Fischer, Philipp/V-7948-2019; Fischer, Philipp/R-9804-2016	Premke, Katrin/0000-0001-6216-5386; Fischer, Philipp/0000-0002-3357-5420													0003-4088	2100-000X					2010	46	3					157	168		10.1051/limn/2010017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2010017													WOS:000281698300002

Environmental DNA as a tool to help inform zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, management in inland lakes	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species that plague much of North America and are difficult to impossible to eradicate once they become established. Therefore, prevention and monitoring are key elements in the control of these organisms. Traditional microscopy is commonly used in monitoring but requires the presence of larval veligers. This limits the times when resource managers can monitor for the presence in northern lakes. A new monitoring tool, environmental DNA (eDNA), may allow for a more efficient and cost-effective monitoring program for zebra mussels. We developed and tested an environmental DNA assay in the fall and spring for zebra mussels in two Minnesota lakes, one heavily infested and another newly infested. We found that DNA copy numbers tended to be higher near the lake bottom and DNA was more concentrated in softer substrates. We also found that the amount of zebra mussel DNA sampling in winter resulted in similar results to when sampled in fall. This suggests that one could collect and analyze eDNA for zebra mussels during winter months to help inform future efforts in monitoring and control.

The aim of this study was to follow the dynamics of abiotic (organic carbon, total phosphorus, total nitrogen) and biotic (chlorophyll a, cyanobacteria, algae, nano -flagellates, ciliates, rotifers, crustaceans) parameters during two consecutive winters in three eutrophic lakes of different mixing regime (northeastern Poland). Our results showed that dissolved organic carbon was highly stable during both winters and practically did not differ among the studied lakes. Total phosphorus and chlo-rophyll a concentrations differed significantly between the dimictic and meromictic lakes. The concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll a and the biomass of phytoplankton, protists, rotifers and crustaceans reached higher values in late winter than in early winter, depending on the lake type (morphometry, mixing regime) and the year of the study. The composition of phytoplankton and ciliates was more or less similar throughout the study in all lakes during both years, but the share of individual groups in the total biomass differed between early and late winter. A high cyanobacterial biomass in January under the ice in the meromictic lake was probably a legacy of the summer/autumn community. Small prostomatid ciliates were the most important group in late winter in the shallow lake. Cladocerans (Bosmina coregoni and B. longispina) were an important component of winter crusta-cean community on some occasions, especially in the shallow lake. Phosphorus was the major factor determining phytoplankton biomass. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates and rotifers were negatively related to ice cover, while ciliates were positively related to the water temperature. Our study demonstrated that the dynamics, abundance, and structure of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in eutrophic lakes changed from one winter to the next despite similar environmental conditions.

J	Clarke, LR; Letizia, PS; Bennett, DH				Clarke, LR; Letizia, PS; Bennett, DH			Autumn-to-spring energetic and diet changes among kokanee from North Idaho Lakes with and without Mysis relicta	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Changes in the Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho, zooplankton community during spring and autumn have been attributed to planktivory by the opossum shrimp Mysis relicta. To examine how the altered zooplankton community affects kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka, we compared seasonal body lipids and feeding patterns of age-0 and age-1 individuals from Pend Oreille Lake with those of kokanee from Coeur d'Alene and Spirit lakes, Idaho, which did not contain M. relicta. We also contrasted our feeding pattern analysis with results of a similar study conducted in Pend Oreille Lake before M. relicta introduction. Age-0 Pend Oreille Lake kokanee showed no evidence of malnourishment. as body lipids and feeding patterns were generally similar among the three lakes. Age-1 Pend Oreille Lake kokanee had lower body lipids and stomach fullness than age-1 kokanee in the other lakes, suggesting that zooplankton community changes might affect older kokanee. We saw no evidence of direct starvation mortality in either Pend Oreille Lake year-class, since body lipids were higher than prior studies have reported for starving individuals. Seasonal kokanee feeding patterns were similar between age-classes but differed among lakes, Pend Oreille Lake individuals consuming a lower proportion of Daphnia during autumn compared with Coeur d'Alene Lake and Spirit Lake fish. Kokanee fed upon small copepod species during spring in all three lakes. Before M. relicta establishment in Pend Oreille Lake, kokanee in autumn ate a higher proportion of cladocerans, consumed a greater total prey biomass, and had fewer empty stomachs, but spring feeding patterns were more similar to those we observed. Our results show that seasonal changes in zooplankton availability in Pend Oreille Lake have probably changed age-1 kokanee foraging and energy accumulation patterns, particularly in autumn, although we cannot exclude the possibility that recent changes in predation intensity may also explain our results.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2004	24	2					597	608		10.1577/M03-99.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-99.1													WOS:000222067500023

During the spring and summer period, total rotifer density differed markedly. In spring rotifer populations remained at low density and an inverse relationship with cladoceran biomass was found. In contrast, in summer, the rotifer densities increased greatly and a positive relationship with cladoceran biomass was observed. Food resources decreased during mid January and this seemed to give rotifers a competitive advantage over cladocerans. Bosmina longirostris and Ceriodaphnia dubia were both present during the spring, but only Bosmina prevailed in summer. The composition of cladoceran assemblages together with food resources seem to be an important factor in rotifer dynamics.

Two different categories of zooplankton indices (1/ biocoenotic indices, including dominating species; 2/ trait-based approaches, including ecological groups: littoral vs. pelagic com-munity and functional feeding groups) were compared in small water bodies of two regions of Europe (1/ Northern water bodies (N-WB): Poland, and 2/ Southern water bodies (S-WB): Croatia). We hypothesized that latitudinal variation between these regions will result in distinguishing specific environmental factors that in turn affect the structure of zooplankton communities. In order to avoid weather extremes in both countries, we focused our research on less frequently investigated periods of the year; during the unvegetated and mild -temperature seasons (spring and autumn). Despite well pronounced differences in some abiotic characteristics of water between both regions (higher chlorophyll a and phosphorus contents in N-WB compared to better oxy-genated waters and higher water transparency in S-WB) we observed rather uniform pattern with respect to zooplankton trait-based indices in N-WB and S-WB. This may have been caused by poor habitat heterogeneity due to macrophyte absence (spring) or decaying state (autumn) and poor food supply during the spring/autumn seasons. Planktonic and detrivorous rotifers (e.g. from genera Keratella and Brachionus) predominated in both countries. Ecological and trophic functional traits were mostly determined by the morphometric and trophic properties. Irrespective of latitudinal variation, water transparency emerged as a significant factor, negatively affecting zooplankton abundance, especially the dominating detrivorous rotifers, and positively littoral zoo -plankton. Moreover, an increase in water area, related to higher contents of nutrients and food resources, supported a higher abundance of the majority of zooplankton feeding guilds. Our results suggested that only at the level of taxa the distinctiveness between the two European regions, northern and southern, was clear. Apart from taxa dominating in both countries (Keratella cochlearis, Bosmina longirostris), Polyarthra spp. and Eudiaptomus gracilis dominated exclusively in Croatia and Cyclops sp. in Poland during the unvegetated and temperature-transitional seasons. This indicates that only the taxonomic approach, referring to certain dom-inating species, was a sensitive tool. Functional trait-based approaches, despite providing relevant information on the quality of aquatic ecosystems, are not sufficiently sensitive in identification of latitudinal variation of zooplankton in the spring/autumn season.

J	Scherwass, A; Arndt, H				Scherwass, A; Arndt, H			Structure, dynamics and control of the ciliate fauna in the potamoplankton of the River Rhine	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Planktonic ciliate abundance and taxonomic composition were investigated from November 1998 to January 2000 in the River Rhine at Cologne, Germany. The composition of the ciliate fauna revealed the occurrence of both typical benthic (drifting peritrichs) as well as pelagic ciliates (oligotrichs) in the potamoplankton. Oligotrich ciliates prevailed in the potamoplankton community. Peritrichs, represented almost exclusively by sessile species, appeared to be washed out from the substrate at increased water discharge during flood events. Highest abundances of ciliates were registered during the phytoplankton spring bloom, indicating a bottom-up control of ciliates during this time, an observation which was supported by laboratory experiments. In summary, the ciliate potarnoplankton community of the River Rhine is controlled by a seasonally varying set of factors: 1) Flood events in early spring and autumn cause a short-term succession from drifting peritrichs to pelagic oligotrichs, 2) the phytoplankton spring bloom supports oligotrich population growth, and 3) the low water level and subsequently high grazing pressure by benthic predators (mainly the mussel Corbicula) reduce the abundance of ciliates. The latter was probably the major reason for the extremely low ciliate abundances observed during summer.

Hidden biofilms in a far northern lake and implications for the changing Arctic	NPJ BIOFILMS AND MICROBIOMES												Shallow lakes are common across the Arctic landscape and their ecosystem productivity is often dominated by benthic, cyanobacterial biofilms. Many of these water bodies freeze to the bottom and are biologically inactive during winter, but full freeze-up is becoming less common with Arctic warming. Here we analyzed the microbiome structure of newly discovered biofilms at the deepest site of a perennially ice-covered High Arctic lake as a model of polar microbial communities that remain unfrozen throughout the year. Biofilms were also sampled from the lake's shallow moat region that melts out and refreezes to the bottom annually. Using high throughput small subunit ribosomal RNA sequencing, we found more taxonomic richness in Bacteria, Archaea and microbial eukaryotes in the perennially unfrozen biofilms compared to moat communities. The deep communities contained both aerobic and anaerobic taxa including denitrifiers, sulfate reducers, and methanogenic Archaea. The water overlying the deep biofilms was well oxygenated in mid-summer but almost devoid of oxygen in spring, indicating anoxia during winter. Seasonally alternating oxic-anoxic regimes may become increasingly widespread in polar biofilms as fewer lakes and ponds freeze to the bottom, favoring prolonged anaerobic metabolism and greenhouse gas production during winter darkness.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Lovejoy, Connie/A-3756-2008	Bouchard, Frederic/0000-0001-9687-3356; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Lovejoy, Connie/0000-0001-8027-2281														2055-5008				JUL 6	2017	3								17	10.1038/s41522-017-0024-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41522-017-0024-3								28702216					WOS:000412923000001

A particularly vulnerable life-cycle stage is the migration of mature adult eels downstream from freshwater habitats through estuaries into the sea to spawn. This study investigated the factors associated with downstream migration of the short-finned eel Anguilla australis (Richardson 1841) from a coastal wetland (Lake Condah) in south-east Australia, using acoustic telemetry. Migration was associated with time of the year, higher water level and river flows, decreasing water temperature, and darker moon phases. Larger individuals and those in better condition were more likely to migrate from the wetland. Downstream migration peaked in spring, in contrast to the typical autumn migration period for other temperate anguillids. Variable responses, in comparison to other studies, highlight how migration cues may not be universal. In south-east Australia, short-finned eels may have evolved to migrate in multiple phases by first migrating to the estuary during typical seasonal spring flow pulses (e.g., to avoid being stranded in upland reaches during dry summer periods) and then migrating into the ocean in autumn.

However, NRM acquisition depends on conditions inherent to the depositional environment. In addition to recording a precise annual chronology, varved sediments reflect marked annual sedimentary changes. The Earth's magnetic field does not vary significantly over such a short period, so magnetic changes recorded by varves are expected to reflect the influence of depositional parameters on the recording process. We focus here on a sequence of 27 +/- 1 varves from the former proglacial Lake Ojibway (similar to 8.5 ka cal BP) from which individual cm-thick summer and winter beds were sampled. Paleomagnetic, granulometric and geochemical analyses were conducted on each bed. A mean inclination shallowing of 24.3 degrees is observed in winter beds, along with an 11.3 degrees shallowing in summer beds. Magnetic declinations follow, on average, the expected field direction, but differences of up to 20 degrees occur between successive beds. Summer beds are thicker than winter beds and have stronger magnetic susceptibility, higher Ca/Fe ratios and coarser sedimentary and magnetic grains. This grain size pattern reflects the input of coarser detrital particles during summer, while the finer fraction remained in suspension until it was deposited in winter. A combination of differential compaction between the winter and summer beds, seasonally varying physical and magnetic properties of sediments, and delayed NRM acquisition explains the variable and coercivity-dependent inclination shallowing.

J	Kohler, J; Bosse, S				Kohler, J; Bosse, S			Growth and losses of phytoplankton studied with a new dialysis chamber technique along the river Spree	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The development of the main phytoplankton taxa was studied in a water parcel flowing along a 28-km stretch of the lower Spree as well as in simultaneously incubated dialysis chambers. The chambers were continuously moved through the water column in order to provide the enclosed algae with light of the same mean intensity and of comparable frequency of fluctuations as experienced by the phytoplankton transported downstream. The difference between the rate of population increase along the river and the growth rate in dialysis chambers equals the sum of all losses prevented inside the chamber but occurring in the river. Centric diatoms dominated phytoplankton biomass for the growing season. They grew in their water parcel during downstream flow in spring (+0.13 +/- 0.25 d(-1)) but declined during summer (-0.79 +/- 0.44 d(-1), each average +/- standard deviation). Green algae showed the highest rates of decline in spring but maintained their abundance most successfully along the river in summer. The other algal groups declined throughout the season with a tendency to stronger reductions in summer. The growth rate (= rate of cell replication of caged phytoplankton minus losses inside the chambers) of centric diatoms was higher in spring (0.57 +/- 0.14 d(-1)) than during summer (0.25 +/- 0.13 d(-1)). All the other algal groups grew faster in dialysis chambers in summer than in spring. The mean calculated loss rate of total phytoplankton increased from 0.44 +/- 0.25 d(-1) in spring to 1.05 +/- 0.32 d(-1) during summer. Only the chlorophytes maintained losses at a low level (0.41 +/- 0.24 d(-1)) even in summer. Different intensity of sedimentation and grazing of benthic filter-feeders may explain longitudinal development of phytoplankton as well as seasonal shifts between diatoms and chlorophytes.

SEASONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND CHEMICAL IMPACT ON THECAMOEBIAN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN AN OIL SANDS RECLAMATION WETLAND IN NORTHERN ALBERTA	PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA												Thecamoebian (testate amoeba) communities appear to respond to a variety of chemical parameters in aquatic ecosystems impacted by oil sands operations. A seasonal study, conducted over four seasons from May 2008 to March 2009 (spring, summer, fall and winter) in a constructed aquatic environment at the Mildred Lake site of Syncrude Canada Ltd. in northeastern Alberta, identified species and strain-level variation among living (i.e., Rose Bengal-stained) thecamoebians. The changes in this epibenthic community appeared to reflect seasonal and micro-environmental changes, as little change in the porewater chemistry, composition of sediments or bottom waters was observed over the study interval. The total (living + dead) thecamoebian test assemblage remained relatively constant over the course of the study, suggesting that the fossil assemblage reflects time-averaged conditions. Some variability was, however, observed among the species composing the difflugiid population. In addition, the speed at which they respond to environmental changes emphasizes their potential usefulness as environmental indicators. This has important implications for the use of thecamoebians as paleoenvironmental indicators. The difference between living and total assemblages reflects taphonomic skewing presumably resulting from variations in preservation potential and/or selective predation of species and strains.																			1935-3952	1094-8074					2010	13	2							13A															WOS:000280526300007

Read			Assessing Nearshore Nekton Abundance, Substrate, and Environmental Conditions in the Northern Gulf of Mexico: Are There Differences Among Three Adjacent Coastal Areas and Have There Been Changes over Three Decades (1986-2015)?	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Fishery-independent data on fishes and crustaceans collected in spring and fall over three decades (1986-2015) from coastal areas of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama were analyzed to determine if these areas differed in species composition and environmental conditions over this period. Multivariate community analyses revealed significant differences in species composition among the three areas in trawl collections for both spring (ANOSIM, R = 0.543, p < 0.001) and fall (R = 0.722, p < 0.001), while seine collections were not significantly different among the areas for either season (spring, R < - 0.06, p = 0.61; fall, R < 0.167, p = 0.14). The most important factor contributing to these differences was the presence of more shell substrate at the Louisiana sites (LINKTREE analysis, B% = 86, p < 0.05). Abundance data for common species were used to test for changes over the three decades. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and least puffers (Sphoeroides parvus) experienced decreases in four of eight area-season-gear scenarios. Four species of flatfishes also experienced multiple declines. Salinity increased at the Louisiana trawl sites over the period in both spring (+ 2.92; ANOVA, p < 0.001) and fall (+ 5.97; ANOVA, p = 0.001-0.002), while spring trawl sites became warmer in Mississippi (+ 2.15 degrees C; ANOVA, p = 0.001-0.002). Alabama trawl sites became warmer in both spring (+ 3.36 degrees C; ANOVA, p < 0.001) and fall (+ 1.91 degrees C; ANOVA, p < 0.001). With declines in species and changes in environmental conditions, this region faces multiple challenges in maintaining its estuarine fisheries.					; Peterson, Mark/HTP-1480-2023	Powers, Sean/0000-0002-4770-9944; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				DEC	2019	42	8					2139	2169		10.1007/s12237-019-00632-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-019-00632-z													WOS:000497274900011

In the ice-covered lake (0.30 mg PO4-P L-1, 1.35 mg NH4-N L-1; TSISD = 64; TSIchl = 93), the algal bloom, responsible for high concentration of dissolved oxygen in water, consisted mainly of the centric diatom Stephanodiscus minutulus (3.9 x 10(7) ind. L-1) accompanied by Limnothrix redekei (Cyanobacteria), Koliella longiseta (Chlorophyceae), > 1.1 x 10(6) ind. L-1 each, as well as Mallomonas sp. (Chrysophyceae) and Monoraphidium komarkovae (Chlorophyceae), >5.0 x 10(5) ind. L-1 each. The toxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii of extremely long trichomes (up to 0.93 mm) and potentially toxic dinoflagellate Peridinium aciculiferum f. inerme occurred also in high numbers (1.9 x 10(5) ind. L-1 and 7.7 x 10(4) ind. L-1, respectively). In summer (0.05 ing PO4-P L-1; 0.42 mg NH4-N L-1; TSISD = 78; TSIchl = 102), the phytoplankton bloom consisted of P agardhii (average total abundance 49.4 x 10(6) ind. L-1) and ten other taxa of Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Cryptophyceae (average total abundance 17.9 x 10(6) ind. L-1). The total phytoplankton abundance was 1.5 times higher in summer than in winter and the total biomass of the most abundant species was approximately 4 times higher in warm (139.8 mg L-1) than in cold season (32.5 ing L-1). The values of the Shannon-Weaver diversity index were very low, however, over 2 times higher in summer (0.60) than in winter (0.31). The obtained results revealed that in the hypertrophic lake the very high nutrient concentrations (especially NH4-N and PO4-P), found both in winter and summer, were responsible for year-long mass development of phytoplankton. The winter phytoplankton was composed mainly of very small centric diatoms, whereas summer blooms were created by filamentous cyanobacteria (mainly Oscillatoriales; 98%).

Zooplankton diversity was higher in autumn than in spring and it was positively correlated with lake size (area and depth) in spring, but not in early autumn. This effect is partially explained by the sharp zooplankton stratification in deep lakes, in early autumn. Some morphometric characteristics of lake basins were also correlated with the structure of zooplankton communities. Principal component analyses (PCA) and Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) performed on zooplankton data and a posterior correlation analysis with the extracted factors and main limnological parameters showed that trophic state in the first place, and mineralization in the second place, were the main sources of variance to explain our data. However, the results of these analyses also show that important sources explaining the variance of zooplankton data include some factors not quantified in the standard limnological analysis, but evidently related to lake typology, such as shallowness and type of water feeding and flux.

However, little is known about how seasonal and lake-specific aTEA fluxes form anaerobic oxidation capacity (AOC) to oxidize organic carbon in boreal systems. We compiled 26 years of data from two interconnected semi-pristine boreal lakes and defined mean daily imports, pools, and exports of aTEAs. In both lakes, the export of NO3 formed 2 %-3 % of the total AOC in summer and autumn, and up to 11 % in winter and spring. In a predominantly monomictic humic lake surrounded by peatlands, Fe was responsible for 15 %-31 % of the seasonal export of AOC, with a large proportion of Fe originating from the lake bottom. A dimictic clear-water lake downstream retained Fe and exported 87 %-95 % of AOC as SO4. In the humic lake, the annual SO4:Fe:NO3 export ratio for AOC was 10:3:1 and in the clear-water lake 15:0.4:1. In the monomictic lake, exports were specifically regulated by stratification; in the dimictic lake, exports were more regulated by spring flooding and the ascending and descending side of the peak flood. These events modified lake dynamics and caused lake-specific NO3, Fe, and SO4 exports which continued for months. We conclude that a catchment and lake network can cause spatial and temporal variation in exports of NO3, Fe, and SO4 affecting AOC export. Such natural variations in exports have significant potential to modify the system's capacity to oxidize C and resist changes in oxidation-reduction reactions coupled to nutrient cycling and the formation of greenhouse gases in downstream water bodies.

The samples were collected on the Campus of Uludag University, which is in a semirural region. The samples were collected using a high-volume air sampler. The gas and particle phase concentrations of 87 PCB congeners (I 87PCB) pound were measured in these samples. The average gas and particle phase concentrations of the I 87PCB pound were calculated to be 293 +/- 257 and 52 +/- 56 ng/m(3), respectively. However, the results of short-term measurements showed that the variation among the measurements in the gas phase was up to 39-fold and up to 84-fold in the particle phase. These results demonstrated that the ambient air PCB concentrations were not stable and changed dramatically on a daily basis. Therefore, it was clear that a small number of samples could not be representative of the entire region. Furthermore, the obtained concentrations showed differences that depended on the meteorological conditions and long distance transportation. The sampling indicated that PCB homologues with 3 or 4 chlorines were dominant.

The obtained results showed that the average values of Fe (9.816 +/- 0.390 mu g/g) and Cu (1.343 +/- 0.0.589 mu g/g) in B. grypus were at the highest level in summer and autumn. However, Fe and Cu levels which are under detection limit in S. triostegus were not determined throughout the seasons. The highest Cd and Zn levels were measured in the summer for S. triostegus as 0.060 +/- 0.000 and 9.696 +/- 0.339 mu g/g and for B. grypus as 0.039 +/- 0.007 and 11.347 +/- 1.13 mu g/g, respectively. The highest Pb levels were recorded in winter as 0.063 +/- 0.002 and 0.301 +/- 0.321 mu g/g for S. triostegus and B. Grypus, respectively. The highest Hg levels were determined in Autumn for the two fish species (for S. triostegus as 0.093 +/- 0.005 mu g/g; for B. grypus as 0.057 +/- 0.010 mu g/g).

Recruitment synchrony of yellow perch (Perca flavescens, Percidae) in the Great Lakes region, 1966-2008	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Population-level reproductive success (recruitment) of many fish populations is characterized by high inter-annual variation and related to annual variation in key environmental factors (e.g., climate). When such environmental factors are annually correlated across broad spatial scales, spatially separated populations may display recruitment synchrony (i.e., the Moran effect). We investigated inter-annual (1966-2008) variation in yellow perch (Perca flavescens, Percidae) recruitment using 16 datasets describing populations located in four of the five Laurentian Great Lakes (Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Ontario) and Lake St. Clair. We indexed relative year class strength using catch-curve residuals for each year-class across 2-4 years and compared relative year-class strength among sampling locations. Results indicate that perch recruitment is positively synchronized across the region. In addition, the spatial scale of this synchrony appears to be broader than previous estimates for both yellow perch and freshwater fish in general. To investigate potential factors influencing relative year-class strength, we related year class strength to regional indices of annual climatic conditions (spring-summer air temperature, winter air temperature, and spring precipitation) using data from 14 weather stations across the Great Lakes region. We found that mean spring-summer temperature is significantly positively related to recruitment success among Great Lakes yellow perch populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneously, their resting cysts were collected in sediment traps. Concentrations of active strombidiids at 0 to 20 m depth ranged from 50 cells l(-1) (February) to 2100 cells l(-1) (May). The genera Pelagostrombidium and Limnostrombidium coexisted during all seasons, with Pelagostrombidium being the dominating taxon, contributing 70 and 83% to total strombidiids in September 1999 and May 2001, respectively. Throughout the study period, only 1 cyst type was observed, which in size and shape matched a previous description of Pelagostrombidium cysts. Maxima of cyst production (up to 2 x 10(5) cells m(-2) d(-1)) occurred in October/November, while virtually no cysts were detected in winter, spring and early summer. The absence of a spring maximum of cyst formation contrasts with earlier observations from pre-alpine Lake Constance. We explain this finding by a different timing of strombidiid development, relative to the phytoplankton spring bloom in both lakes.					; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023	Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				SEP	2002	29	2					181	188		10.3354/ame029181	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame029181													WOS:000178397900007

The distinct relationship between the food spectrum of fish with the composition of zooplankton and zoobenthos is revealed. It is shown that fish prefer to feed on mass objects (mainly zoobenthos), but both the seasonal variability of their contribution to the diet and their relative importance in fish of different lengths are significant. Amphipods (Gammarus lacustris and Monoporeia affinis) accounted for >90% in summer and >40% in autumn in the total weight of perch stomach content. Vendace consumed amphipods in the summer (>50%) and mollusks (up to 50%) in the autumn. Cladocerans are important food items in the autumn diet of fish (18-25%). In the diet of larger (18-25 cm) perch, the contributions of sticklebacks and vendace increased, but amphipods still prevailed (>40%).

As such, spring freshet flooding and summer rainfall flooding due to wet precipitation (e.g. snow and rainfall) may sharply increase the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous, and carbon compounds in barrier lakes. Too much nutrients will lead to lake eutrophication. In this study, we used Lake Jingpo, the world's second largest alpine barrier lake, to examine the impact of spring freshet flooding and summer rainfall flooding on its water quality by building a hydrodynamic water quality model with MIKE 21. Results The MIKE 21 HD hydrodynamic model and MIKE 21 AD convection and diffusion module were calibrated using meteorological data, hydrological data, and water quality data collected in 2018. All errors were in the acceptable range. According to model simulation results, the flow velocity in Lake Jingpo is generally weak (mostly lower than 0.015 m/s), but it increases to 0.045 m/s and above during spring freshet flooding (April-May) and summer rainfall flooding (August-September), which is much higher than in other months. The flow volume of its largest inflowing river reaches 4.81 x 10(8) m(3), 29.77 x 10(8) m(3), and 58.4 x 10(8) m(3) during spring freshet flooding, summer rainfall flooding, and 30-year frequency rainfall flooding period, respectively. The longest diffusion distances from the lake mouth to the downstream way are 16.3 km, 33.1 km, and 43.6 km during the spring freshet flooding, summer rainfall flooding, and 30-year frequency rainfall flooding period, respectively. A larger amount of precipitation leads to longer diffusion distances and increased concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), and ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N) in the lake. Conclusions The sudden increase in water volume during spring flooding and summer rainfall flooding led to the rapid spread of nutrients and pollutants carried by the water into the barrier lake, resulting in a deterioration of lake water quality. In addition to pollution source control measures, ecological restoration, and the construction of a buffer system in the catchment are very important measures to effectively improve the buffer capacity of barrier lakes in light of spring freshet flooding and summer rainfall flooding.																			2190-4707	2190-4715				APR 7	2020	32	1							57	10.1186/s12302-020-00319-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00319-4													WOS:000525235800001

A water-budget approach, presented here, circumvents the need for transfer functions in wetlands, using the Garden Basin cattail fen (GBC; Fish Lake Plateau, Utah, USA) as a model system. Prior studies of the GBC fen revealed both high and low-frequency oscillations between fen and pond states over the last 12.5 ka. Pollen indicated that pond-like conditions were accompanied by both greater monsoon and annual precipitation rates. However, the magnitude of these changes was not estimated. By synthesizing multiple approaches, including water-level monitoring, remote sensing (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), and terrain analysis, limits were placed on precipitation changes required for pond versus fen ecosystems in Garden Basin. NDVI data show that water levels may be controlled by evapotranspiration (ET) instead of spring snowmelt. Water levels increase in mid-winter in response to the decline of photosynthesis of surrounding pi pinon-juniper (PJ) forest. In late summer through fall, ET drives the fen system into a moisture deficit and water declines below the ground surface. Quantitative limits on both annual and seasonal precipitation changes can be obtained through water budgets. For the GBC model, mean annual precipitation (similar to 350 mm/yr) must double (similar to 700 mm/yr) to sustain perennial standing water for 95% of years. Increases in late summer (monsoon) through fall (cyclonic) precipitation requires lesser rates (100-200 mm/yr) to satisfy PJ ET demands to maintain standing water. Thus, the habitats of many wetlands globally may be particularly sensitive to late-season precipitation where ET is the primary control on water levels. In summary, the GBC fen and its water budget are a template for quantifying the magnitude, rather than just the direction, of precipitation change in wetland systems through time.

J	BOWLING, L				BOWLING, L			OCCURRENCE AND POSSIBLE CAUSES OF A SEVERE CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOM IN LAKE CARGELLIGO, NEW-SOUTH-WALES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Although smaller cyanobacterial blooms had occurred in Lake Cargelligo in previous summers, a severe bloom of Anabaema circinalis occurred in the lake in November 1990. Cell numbers exceeded 100 000 cells mL(-1), and toxicity tests revealed the bloom to be highly hepatotoxic. This resulted in the first known closure of a town water supply due to cyanobacteria in New South Wales, Blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi, Oscillatoria mougeotii and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii also occurred in the lake at similar very high eel] numbers during the summer and autumn of 1990-91. All five species persisted until May 1991, although there was no detectable toxicity from January onwards. Severe flooding in the Lachlan River valley upstream of Lake Cargelligo during the winter of 1990 led to nutrient enriched inflows to the lake. These elevated nutrient concentrations would have been a major factor contributing to the bloom. However, other physico-chemical factors were also suitable for cyanobacterial growth.																			0067-1940						1994	45	5					737	745																WOS:A1994PW75600002
J	George, DG; Talling, JF; Rigg, E				George, DG; Talling, JF; Rigg, E			Factors influencing the temporal coherence of five lakes in the English Lake District	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The lakes in the Windermere catchment are all deep, glacial lakes but they differ in size, shape and general productivity. Here, we examine the extent to which year-to-year variations in the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of these lakes varied synchronously over a 30-40-year period. 2. Coherence was estimated by correlating time-series of the spring, summer, autumn and winter characteristics of five lakes: Esthwaite Water, Blelham Tarn, Grasmere and the North and South Basins of Windermere. Three physical, four chemical and two biological time-series were analysed and related to year-to-year variations in a number of key driving variables. 3. The highest levels of coherence were recorded for the physical and chemical variables where the average coherence was 0.81. The average coherence for the biological variables was 0.11 and there were a number of significant negative relationships. The average coherence between all possible lake pairs was 0.59 and average values ranged from 0.50 to 0.74. A graphical analysis of these results demonstrated that the coherence between individual lake pairs was influenced by the relative size of the basins as well as their trophic status. 4. A series of examples is presented to demonstrate how a small number of driving variables influenced the observed levels of coherence. These range from a simple example where the winter temperature of the lakes was correlated with the climatic index known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, to a more complex example where the summer abundance of zooplankton was correlated with wind-mixing. 5. The implications of these findings are discussed and a conceptual model developed to illustrate the principal factors influencing temporal coherence in lake systems. The model suggests that our ability to detect temporal coherence depends on the relative magnitude of three factors: (a) the amplitude of the year-to-year variations; (b) the spatial heterogeneity of the driving variables and (c) the error terms associated with any particular measurement.																			0046-5070					MAR	2000	43	3					449	461		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00566.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00566.x													WOS:000086272000012

A period of rapid linear growth occurred from August to November, but there was little or no growth from November to March when the fish were released. Both fall and winter growth rates were inversely related to rearing density. Final weight and length were also inversely related to rearing density. No significant relationship between load and any growth variable was observed. Fish reared at lower densities in conventional raceways tended to develop bimodal length distributions in winter and early spring. Fish reared in conventional raceways showed significantly larger growth rates and final lengths and weights than those reared in baffled raceways. Food conversions and average delivery times for feed were significantly greater in baffled than in conventional raceways. No significant relationships were observed between either rearing density or load and condition factor, food conversion, or mortality. Mortality was not significantly different between the two raceway types. When fish were transported to seawater for further rearing, there were no significant relationships between mortality in seawater and rearing density or load, but fish reared in baffled raceways had significantly higher mortality than those reared in conventional raceways.																			0033-0779					JUL	1998	60	3					167	178		10.1577/1548-8640(1998)060<0167:EORDAR>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1998)060<0167:EORDAR>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000074896200002

The isotope technique and HYSPLIT 4.9 model were used to study the variation characteristics of the stable isotopes of precipitation and the source of water vapor in this area. The results show that the slope and intercept of the meteoric water line in the Binggou River Basin are significantly lower than those of the global meteoric water line and slightly lower than those of the meteoric water line in northwest China, and the slope and intercept of the meteoric water line in summer and autumn are obviously smaller than they are in winter and spring. The delta O-18 of precipitation is enriched in the warm season, and this obvious temperature effect (greater than 0 degrees C) masked the embodiment of the precipitation effect to some extent. There are great differences in the circulation systems that control the water vapor sources of precipitation in different seasons, and the westerly circulation that carries the water vapor has the greatest impact on Binggou River Basin precipitation, with an average proportion of 53%. The southwestern monsoon and southeastern monsoon also influence the summer precipitation. When the water vapor from the surrounding oceans and lakes reaches the monsoon marginal area in different seasons, the properties of the air mass change significantly, showing a significant seasonal effect on the precipitation value of delta O-18 and the delta D. The seasonal fluctuation characteristics of the stable isotopes of precipitation and their relationship with the temperature, as well as the complex water vapor recharge sources in the Binggou River Basin, show the characteristics of a transition from the eastern monsoon region to the northwestern arid region.

Here, we report results of an integrative study on the successional trajectories of bacterial communities in a seasonally stratified lake with an anoxic hypolimnion. The bacterial community composition of epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion diverged during summer stratification and converged when the lake was mixed. In contrast, bacterial communities in the sediment remained relatively stable over the year. Phototrophic Cyanobacteria and heterotrophic Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Planktomycetes were abundant in the aerobic epilimnion, Gammaproteobacteria (mainly Chromatiaceae) dominated in the metalimnion, and Chlorobi, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes were abundant in the anoxic sulfidic hypolimnion. Anoxic but nonsulfidic conditions expanded to the surface layer during fall turnover, when the epilimnion, metalimnion and upper hypolimnion mixed. During this period, phototrophic sulfur bacteria (Chromatiaceae and Chlorobi) disappeared, Polynucleobacter (Betaproteobacteria) and Methylobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) spread out from the former meta-and hypolimnion to the surface layer, and Epsilonproteobacteria dominated in the bottom water layer. Cyanobacteria and Planktomycetes regained dominance in early spring, after the oxygen concentration was restored by winter mixing. In total, these results show large spatio-temporal changes in bacterial community composition, especially during transitions from oxic to anoxic and from sulfidic to nonsulfidic conditions.

J	Liu, X; Li, Y; Shen, RJ; Zhang, M; Chen, FZ				Liu, Xia; Li, Yun; Shen, Ruijie; Zhang, Min; Chen, Feizhou			Reducing nutrient increases diatom biomass in a subtropical eutrophic lake, China-Do the ammonium concentration and nitrate to ammonium ratio play a role?	WATER RESEARCH												Response of aquatic organisms to eutrophication have been well reported, while less studies are available for the recovery of eutrophic lakes following a reduction in the external loading, especially for systems where nitrogen is reduced but the phosphorus concentration is maintained high due to internal loading. Diatoms are nitrate (NO3-N) opportunists but can also use ammonium (NH4-N). They may, therefore, be more sensitive to nitrogen reduction than other algae that typically prefer NH4-N. We document the variations of nutrients and diatoms in subtropical, eutrophic Lake Taihu over 28 yr during which a reduction of the external loading resulted from lake management. According to the results of change point analysis, data on environmental variables were divided into two periods (P1: 1992-2006; P2: 2007-2019) with two different seasons (WS: Winter-Spring; SA: Summer Autumn), respectively. Compared with P1-WS, the concentration of NH4-N decreased significantly whereas NO3- N showed no significant change in P2-WS. In contrast, NH4-N concentrations were low and showed no significant changes in P1-SA and P2-SA and NO3-N decreased significantly in the latter period. Accordingly, NO3-N: NH4-N mass ratios in P1-SA and P2-WS were all significantly higher than those in P2-SA and P1-WS, respectively. The biomass of WS diatom increased significantly and the timing of the peak biomass shifted from P1-SA to P2-WS since 2007. The SEM analysis showed that NO3-N was retained as a statistically significant predictor for diatom biomass in P1-SA and significant effects of windspeed, zooplankton and NH4-N on diatom biomass in P2-WS. Windspeed and zooplankton have further changed the biomass of diatoms in the case of declining inorganic nitrogen. We conclude that the magnitude of vernal suppression or stimulation of diatom assemblages has increased, concomitant with the variations of NH4-N and NO3-N: NH4-N mass ratios. Diatoms response to NH4-N or NO3-N is apparently changing in response to water temperature in this eutrophic shallow lake. Thus, parallel reductions in external nitrogen loading, along with variations in dominant inorganic nitrogen, will stimulate the growth of diatom and therefore increase the total biomass of phytoplankton in still high internal phosphorus loading, which is should be regarded as a good sign of restoration measures.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023	Li, Yun/0000-0003-3655-2475; Liu, Xia/0000-0002-6225-9179													0043-1354	1879-2448				JUN 30	2022	218								118493	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118493		APR 2022						35489153					WOS:000798543600005

Around a chott in the wetland complex in the high plains near Constantine (eastern Algeria), more than half of the species of plants are annuals that dry out in summer, a situation that prompted us to sample the vegetation in spring over a period of two years. Three zones were identified based on an analysis of the vegetation and measurements of the salt content of the soils. Surveys carried out at monthly intervals over the course of a year revealed temporal and spatial variations in biodiversity and abundance of grasshoppers. The inner zone is colonized by halophilic plants and only one grasshopper species (Dericorys millierei) occurs there throughout the year. Two polyphagous species of Calliptamus, which can feed on halophilic plants migrate from adjacent areas into the inner zone in August to feed on the plants growing there. The other species of grasshoppers remain in outer zones as they are unable to feed on halophilic plants. The greatest abundance of grasshoppers from August to winter was recorded in the inner zone and in spring and early summer in the outer zones. The dependence of D. millierei on bushes of Amaranthaceae and its moderate flight ability, features of the family Dericorytidae, limit this species ability to colonize neighbouring chotts.																				1802-8829					2016	113						158	172		10.14411/eje.2016.020	http://dx.doi.org/10.14411/eje.2016.020													WOS:000380706700019

Congested and unsustainable planning, reduction in green covers and increased emissions from industries and vehicles have given birth to many climatic issues. One such issue is land surface temperature (LST) variations giving rise to Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. This study evaluates and provides direct evidence with the help of remote sensing technique about how stream water features affect the temperature variation in urban areas where the land use condition is very distinct. Surface water bodies present in an area are responsible for prospective cooling through evaporation thereby reducing the heating effect. Landsat images of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011of 30-meter resolution has been processed to produce the LST of the study areas. Water bodies, i.e., Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh and Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad are the research points to find the variation in microclimate developed near these water bodies. An appreciable average temperature dip of 7.51 degrees C and 3.12 degrees C is observed during summer and winter, respectively for three years near the Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh city. An average dip of about 1.57 degrees C and 1.71 degrees C is observed during summer and winter, respectively on the right bank of Sabarmati river up to an influence distance of about 200 to 300 m. The average fall of temperature near the left bank is about 0.69 degrees C and 0.65 degrees C during summer and winter, respectively.

However, the assembly mechanisms and diversity of microbial communities shaped by such environments are poorly understood yet. In this study, we explored aquatic bacterial community diversity and ecological assembly processes in subsidence lakes during winter and summer using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed that clear bacterial community structure was driven by seasonality more than by habitat, and the alpha-diversity and functional diversity of the bacterial community in summer were significantly higher than in winter (p < 0.001). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that temperature and chlorophyll-a were the most crucial contributing factors influencing the community season variations in subsidence lakes. Specifically, temperature and chlorophyll-a explained 18.26 and 14.69% of the community season variation, respectively. The bacterial community variation was driven by deterministic processes in winter but dominated by stochastic processes in summer. Compared to winter, the network of bacterial communities in summer exhibited a higher average degree, modularity, and keystone taxa (hubs and connectors in a network), thereby forming a highly complex and stable community structure. These results illustrate the clear season heterogeneity of bacterial communities in subsidence lakes and provide new insights into revealing the effects of seasonal succession on microbial assembly processes in coal mining subsidence lake ecosystems.

Sample Population-Water samples obtained from 7 feedyard playas and 3 nonfeedyard control playas. Procedure-Surface water samples were collected from each playa and at various depths from 3 feedyard playas. Endotoxin concentrations, 22 water quality variables, and fecal coliform counts were determined in samples collected in summer and winter from various combinations of playas. Results-Cattle numbers per feedyard ranged from 40,000 to 175,000 head/y. Mean endotoxin concentrations were significantly lower in control playas than in feedyard playas in winter and summer. Endotoxin concentration appeared to be homogenous at various water depths. Values for 20 of 22 water quality variables were higher in the feedyard playas than in control playas in winter and summer. In winter only, mean total fecal coliform concentration in feedyard playas was significantly greater than in control playas. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that feedyards have the potential to impact water quality in playas, and cattle should not be allowed access to them. Feedyard playa water should not be used under high pressure to settle dust in pens with cattle or to cool cattle, because aerosols containing pathogens and high concentrations of endotoxin are a health hazard for humans and cattle.																			0002-9645					SEP	2001	62	9					1402	1407		10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1402	http://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1402								11560268					WOS:000170755400013

Esker ridges stretches in the direction of past ice melt. In coastal regions eskers are covered by marine deposits. Inland systems have unconfined recharge areas and sometimes confined discharge areas. Eskers are often connected to important ecosystems such as lakes, rivers, springs and peatlands. Kettle lakes are located within the esker and are usually groundwater-dependent. In Finland, groundwater in eskers is threatened by peatland drainage, roads and other land-uses. In this paper we review previous results on climate change in Finland, present results from our previous studies on eskers and discuss the impacts of climate change and land-use in eskers. Climate models predict an increase in precipitation but this is uncertain. Analysis of past annual climate variability based on 100-year data show a clear cyclical variation in climate, without any clear trend in precipitation or temperature in Central Finland. Periods of dry and wet years seem to occur at regular intervals. Assuming current predictions on changes of climate in Finland, the period of permanent snow cover will decrease. In central Finland, recharge will with assumed warmer climate occur in areas with permanent winter snow cover. Consequently, the minimum groundwater level in winter will increase in winter as recharge occurs all year. Modelling also show a risk of reduced summer groundwater levels as the snow melt recharge occur earlier in spring. As changes in winter climate seems to be the main impact of climate warming, groundwater models should include winter processes such as snow accumulation, melt and impact of frost on soil permeability.

J	Mogensen, S; Post, JR				Mogensen, Stephanie; Post, John R.			Energy allocation strategy modifies growth-survival trade-offs in juvenile fish across ecological and environmental gradients	OECOLOGIA												In young temperate zone fishes, conflicting energy demands lead to variability in growing season and winter survival. Growing season survival is driven by size-dependent predation risk whereas winter survival is constrained by autumn body size, energy storage and winter duration. We developed a model of the seasonality of energetics coupled to empirical measures of resource availability, size-dependent predation and temperature seasonality for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in two sets of lakes in British Columbia, Canada, representing endpoints of a gradient of temperature, growing season duration and winter duration. This model was used to determine the energy allocation strategy which maximized first-year survival across these gradients. Survival was sensitive to the timing of the switch from somatic to storage strategies in cold, short growing season, low resource environments. A broader range of energy allocation strategies were viable in warmer, longer growing season and higher resource lakes. We used empirical observations of autumn energy storage and our modeled values for size-dependent minimal lipid levels needed to survive winter in each system to estimate winter survival for juvenile rainbow trout. Winter survival estimates were 6% in cold lakes with low resources, 82% in warm, lakes with low resources and 100% in warm lakes with high resources. Fish in warm lakes with ample resources allocated substantially more to storage than the minimum required to survive winter generated from our model, suggesting additional selection pressures for increased storage when there was ample surplus energy. We concluded that growth-survival trade-offs, modified by seasonality of the environment, influenced the growing season energy allocation strategies for young-of-the-year fish, and suggested this may be important for understanding population viability across environmental gradients.																			0029-8549					APR	2012	168	4					923	933		10.1007/s00442-011-2164-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2164-0								22020818					WOS:000301604200004

This turtle population is at the northern limit of its range and considered threatened. Of the 30 individuals captured and marked, 15 females and eight males were equipped with radio-transmitters and monitored from two weeks to 29 months. Mean annual home range size for females (32.06 km(2) =, N = 11) was significantly larger than for males (2.75 km(2) = N = 4). Home ranges generally consisted of a spring-summer concentration area (0.90 km(2)) and a fall-winter concentration area (1.80 km(2)) plus the area traversed between these concentration areas. In general, movements did not vary significantly from May to September, but turtles were less active after mid-September. Three hibernacula and three nesting sites were identified. Seventy five percent of the radio-tracked individuals were concentrated in a small area surrounding one hibernaculum from September to April. We hypothesize that habitat fragmentation, both natural and resulting from human activities, was in part responsible for the large home range and long movements observed. Results indicate that, to conserve this spiny softshell turtle population, the seasonal concentration areas need strict protection, although a lakewide approach promoting the preservation of natural habitats is also necessary.

Water Origin of the Kokkino Stefani Spring (W Greece) Based on Hydrogeochemical Data	ADVANCES IN RESEARCH IN KARST MEDIA	Environmental Earth Sciences-Series				4th International Symposium on Karst	APR 27-30, 2010	Malaga, SPAIN	Univ Malaga, Ctr Hydrogeol, Spanish Geolog Survey, UNESCO, Int Hydrolog Programme, Inst Geologico Minero Espana				The Kokkino Stefani spring is located in western Greece on the NE shore of Trichonis Lake, which is the largest lake of the country. The climate is semi -arid with water excess and deficiency during winter and summer, respectively. The area belongs to the Olonos-Pindos isopic zone consisting of a pre-orogenic sequence of deep-sea sediments successed by syn-orogenic flysch deposits. The contact of karstified Upper Cretaceous limestones with cherts gives rise to most of the springs in Trichonis catchment area with Myrtia spring as a typical example. According to the geological setting, a similar mechanism could also be applied for Kokkino Stefani. However, the discharge values are not consistent with this scenario. Hydrochemical analyses performed on samples collected on a 20 -day basis showed that the Kokkino Stefani spring is classified to the Na-Ca-HCO3 type, displays higher temperature, negative Eh values and is enriched in H2S, F, Na, B and Li; thus being totally different from the Myrtia spring and Trichonis Lake. H2S is of biogenic origin, whereas high F concentrations are due to Ca precipitation. High B and Li values enabled the suggestion of an alternative function mechanism, which involves the existence of a deep aquifer with restricted size and the development of the spring at its current site due to isostatic pressure.

Many taxa showed preferences for one or two of the substrates, as expressed by differences in densities, but few taxa presented an exclusivity for one substrate. Zoobenthos densities (per m(2) of pond bottom) were largely dominated on all substrates and seasons by Chironomidae and Oligochaeta. Other dense macroinvertebrates included Ostracoda (on Chara and Typha stems), Gastropoda (on Typha stems), Ephemeroptera (all substrates), and Ceratopogonidae (on Typha stems). The magnitude of temporal differences in densities was expressed by the ratio of maximal to minimal monthly densities and reached values between 2.8 to 11.8. On all substrates the highest monthly densities were observed in summer or beginning of autumn. The temporal changes in densities were strongly influenced by the life cycles of the invertebrates: presence of numerous young individuals in summer (for example Cypridopsis vidua, Cloeon dipterum, Caenis horaria, Ferrissia wautieri), and emergence (for example Chironomidae in April). Fluctuations in densities, especially on Chara and leaves, were also attributed to modification of substrate condition (surface availability, stage in the decomposition or senescence process). Temporal fluctuations of densities were compared with other lentic water bodies: highest densities showed a common trend, occurring between end of spring and beginning of autumn.					; Oertli, Beat/GXV-4967-2022	Oertli, Beat/0000-0002-8372-9045; 													0018-8158					MAR 24	1995	300						195	204		10.1007/BF00024461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024461													WOS:A1995RB62500019
J	Walsby, AE; Schanz, F				Walsby, AE; Schanz, F			Light-dependent growth rate determines changes in the population of Planktothrix rubescens over the annual cycle in Lake Zurich, Switzerland	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Analyses were made to determine which changes in a Lake Zurich population of Planktothrix rubescens were dependent on light- and temperature-dependent growth rates, and when growth was limited by the mixing depth. Changes in vertical distribution of the cyanobacterium, determined weekly from August 1998 to September 1999, were related to growth increments calculated at 1-h time and 1-m depth intervals from values of irradiance, attenuance, temperature and biomass in the lake, using algorithms based on growth rates in culture. Population biovolume varied annually from 1.2 to 120 cm(3) m(-2). During summer, modelled growth in the metalimnion matched the 50-fold population increase. Modelled growth exceeded the observed increase when Planktothrix was mixed into the nutrient-depleted epilimnion, suggesting nutrient limitation. The measured increase ceased when the mixed depth exceeded the critical depth for growth in autumn (Sverdrup's principle). Light limitation explained the gradual decrease of the population in winter. The steep decline in spring had other causes. Population changes were largely determined by interactions of light and depth distribution; decreases in nutrient loading have had little impact on Planktothrix growth in Lake Zurich.

The St. Marys River connects Lake Superior to the lower Great Lakes making it an important route for ship traffic. Recent pressure by commercial carriers to extend the shipping season by breaking ice earlier in spring, has raised concerns over the possible adverse effects on lake herring reproduction in the river caused by increased turbidity associated with vessel passage. Lake herring spawn in fall and their eggs overwinter under ice cover on the bottom of the St. Marys River. Hatching occurs in the spring after ice-out when water temperatures rise. Specialized incubators were used to hold fertilized lake herring eggs at four experimental sites, chosen to represent the range of various bottom substrate types of the St. Marys River from boulder rock reefs to soft sediments. In winter, incubators were placed under the ice on the bottom of the river at three sires each year. After ice-out, sites were relocated, and the incubators were retrieved and opened to determine the number of live and dead lake herring eggs and larvae. Survival was consistent from year to year at each site with the lowest survival percentage found at the site with the softest sediments, directly adjacent to the St. Marys River channel and downstream of the mouth of the Charlotte River. River bottom type and geographic location were the most important factors in determining egg survival. Sampling for indigenous larval lake herring was done throughout the spring hatching season in the areas adjacent to the incubator sites using nets and a diver-operated suction sampler. Results indicate that a small population (< 10 per 1,000 m(3)) of larval lake herring was present throughout the sampling areas during the springs of 1994, 1995, and 1996 in the St. Marys River.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						15	24																WOS:000078180200002

M.			Driving factors of the phytoplankton functional groups in a deep Mediterranean reservoir	WATER RESEARCH												The control of phytoplankton growth is mainly related to the availability of light and nutrients. Both may select phytoplankton species, but only if they occur in limiting amounts. During the last decade, the functional groups approach, based on the physiological, morphological and ecological attributes of the species, has proved to be a more efficient way to analyze seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass. We analysed the dynamics of the phytoplankton functional groups sensu Reynolds, recognising the driving forces (light, mixing regime, and nutrients) in the Sau Reservoir, based on a one year cycle (monthly surface-water sampling). The Sau Reservoir is a Mediterranean water-supply reservoir with a canyon-shaped basin and a clear and mixed epilimnion layer. The long stratification period and high light availability led to high phytoplankton biomass (110.8 fresh-weight mg L-1) in the epilimnion during summer. The reservoir showed P-limitation for phytoplankton growth in this period. All functional groups included one or more species (X2-Rhodomonas spp.; Y-Cryptomonas spp.; F-Oocystis lacustris; K-Aphanocapsa spp.) selected by resources, especially phosphorus. Species of Cryptomonas (group Y) dominated during the mixing period (winter season) in conditions of low light and relatively high availability of dissolved nutrients. Increases in water-column stability during spring stratification led to phytoplankton biomass increases due to the dominance of small flagellate functional groups (X2 and X3, chrysophyceans). The colonial chlorophycean O. lacustris (group F) peaked during the mid-summer stratification, when the mixed epilimnion was clearly depleted in nutrients, especially SRP. High temperature and increases in nutrient concentration during the end-summer and mid-autumn resulted in a decrease of green algae (group F) and increase of Aphanocapsa spp. (cyanobacteria, group K) and dinoflagellates (group L-o). The study also revealed the important role of physical processes in the seasonal gradient, in selecting phytoplankton functional groups, and consequently in the assessment of ecological status. The Q index (assemblage index) based on functional groups indicated the overall good ecological status of the Sau Reservoir, which varied as a function of the mixing regime. This is the first application of the Assemblage Index to a European water-supply reservoir. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ullman, D; Brown, J; Cornillon, P; Mavor, T				Ullman, D; Brown, J; Cornillon, P; Mavor, T			Surface temperature fronts in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The distribution and variability of surface temperature fronts in the Great Lakes is studied using an II year time series (1985 to 1995) of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images. After the removal of cloud contaminated pixels as well as those potentially ice covered, an edge detection algorithm identifies surface temperature fronts in each image. The probability of detecting a front in the Great Lakes is highly variable from lake to lake as well as seasonally. Fronts during the winter months generally have cold water on their shallow side and appear in progressively deeper water as winter progresses. The properties of the winter fronts are consistent with a formation mechanism involving strong surface cooling over a sloping bottom. A spring transition occurs, whereby these fronts disappear and are replaced by nearshore thermal bar fronts with warm water found on their shallow side. The time of this transition depends upon the lake, occurring first in Lake Erie, next in Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan, and finally in Lake Superior. These fronts are also observed to progress slowly into deeper water as nearshore waters warm. The classical thermal bar front (4 degrees C) is seen in all of the lakes but most of the fronts during the spring peak in frontal activity have temperatures greater than 4 degrees C, suggesting that the thermal bar marks the offshore edge of a more extensive frontal zone. Frontal activity declines during summer in all lakes except Superior.																			0380-1330						1998	24	4					753	775		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70860-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70860-3													WOS:000078691900001

The nutrients diluted from the ice may contribute to accumulated concentrations in sediment during winter and an increased risk of algae blooms during the following spring and summer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ice cover on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the water and sediment of a shallow lake, through an examination of Ulansuhai Lake, northern China, from the period of open water to ice season in 2011-2013. The N and P concentrations were between two and five times higher, and between two and eight times higher, than in unfrozen lakes, respectively. As the ice thickness grew, contents of total N and total P showed C-shaped profiles in the ice, and were lower in the middle layer and higher in the bottom and surface layers. Most of the nutrients were released from the ice to liquid water. The results confirm that ice can cause the nutrient concentrations in water and sediment during winter to increase dramatically, thereby significantly impacting on processes in the water environment of shallow lakes.																			0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2016	74	12					2773	2783		10.2166/wst.2016.433	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2016.433								27997388					WOS:000391265600004
J	Liu, B; Jin, HL; Sun, LY; Sun, Z; Su, ZZ				Liu, Bing; Jin, Heling; Sun, Liangying; Sun, Zhong; Su, Zhizhu			Winter and summer monsoonal evolution in northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene period	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY												Climate change especially moisture condition in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan in China are mainly controlled by the strength and variability of Asian winter and summer monsoon. In this paper, we presented the climate record and related winter and summer monsoonal history in Gonghe Basin, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, based on the geochemical indicators (geochemical elements content, i.e., Fe2O3, CaO, Zr and Sr content;and geochemical parameters, i.e., the chemical index of alteration (CIA), Zr/Rb, Rb/Sr, CaO/MgO, SiO2/TiO2 and SiO2/(Al2O3 + Fe2O3) ratio) of the peat deposits and C-14 and OSL technologies. The regional temperature and humidity gradually increased in 10.0-8.5 cal ka BP, accompanied by enhanced summer monsoonal strength and decreased winter monsoonal strength. But climate became cold and dry between 8.5 cal ka BP and 7.6 cal ka BP owing to the stronger winter monsoon. During the 7.6-3.8 cal ka BP, stronger summer monsoon and weaker winter monsoon led to an optimal warm and humid condition, although it had several cold phases. From 3.8 cal ka BP to 0.5 cal ka BP, the regional climate tended to be cold and dry, with increasing winter monsoonal strength and decreasing summer monsoonal strength. Thereafter, the relatively warm and humid climate appeared again, due to the stronger summer monsoon. That is to say, the regional climate conditions are mainly related to the winter and summer monsoonal changes. These changes are consistent with palaeoclimatic records (monsoonal model) from the region influenced by the Asian monsoon in eastern China. In addition, nine cold events were recorded: 8.5-7.8 cal ka BP, 6.1-5.6 cal ka BP, 5.2-4.8 cal ka BP, 4.7-4.3 cal ka BP, 4.1-4.0 cal ka BP, 3.8-3.4 cal ka BP, 3.0-2.3 cal ka BP, 1.4-1.3 cal ka BP, and 1.0-0.5 cal ka BP, which are coincident with cold fluctuations in the high and low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere on a millennial scale, as recorded by lakes, peat sediments, and ice cores in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In conclusion, Holocene millennial-scale climatic changes in Gonghe Basin were controlled by the dual function of Asian monsoonal changes and global cold fluctuations.

J	Ferrao, AS; Arcifa, MS; Fileto, C				Ferrao, AS; Arcifa, MS; Fileto, C			Resource limitation and food quality for cladocerans in a tropical Brazilian lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Food quality of the natural food (seston) from Lake Monte Alegre was evaluated throughout a series of life-table experiments with cladocerans from the same lake carried out in summer and autumn. Experiments were performed using cohorts of newborns originated from ovigerous females cultured for several generations in the lab or taken directly from the lake. For these tests of food limitation, juveniles of different species were submitted to one of the following treatments: ( 1) lake seston and ( 2) lake seston + green algae. The age at first reproduction, mean clutch size, total offspring and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) were estimated. Cladocerans responded to both seasonal changes in food resources and to additions of green algae. In summer, food levels were higher and cladocerans grew better than in autumn. The low fecundity and population growth rates of Daphnia gessneri, together with high C: P ratios (> 500) in the seston in summer, suggested P limitation. The other cladocerans (Moina micrura, Ceriodaphnia cornuta and Simocephalus mixtus) were apparently less sensitive than D. gessneri to P-limitation in summer. However, energy limitation cannot be disregarded even in summer, although in a lower degree compared to autumn. In this season, the predominance of large diatoms and dinophyceans of low nutritional value and the low food concentration suggested both quantitative and qualitative food limitation. Phytoplankton composition, nutritional value and particle size appeared to be important factors in determining cladocerans reproduction rates with seston diets.

The land surface temperature (LST) of the city in four seasons was estimated using the radiative transfer model. The spatial and temporal pattern and characteristics of NDVI, NDBI and LST and their relationship were analyzed in detail. Results show that the regions with higher NDBI and LST values were mainly in the municipal district of Wuhan City, including Hankou and Wuchang. The maximum NDBI of the district in four seasons was 0.669, 0.685, 0.659 and 0.703 respectively, while the maximum LST was 43.529 degrees C, 59.849 degrees C, 47.143 degrees C and 23.875 degrees C. Higher NDVI values were mainly distributed in the regions such as along the Han River, the lake beach and the wetlands area in the southwest and central hilly areas, and the maximum NDVI in different seasons was 0.432, 0.564, 0.442 and 0.158 respectively. There existed a strong positive correlation between NDBI and LST in all seasons. The Pearson's correlation coefficient in four seasons was 0.639, 0.717, 0.807 and 0.762 respectively. In autumn, NDBI and LST were most significantly correlated. The relationship between NDVI and LST changed with season, but without obvious regularity. The correlation between NDVI and LST was weaker in four seasons than that between NDBI and LST, with the Pearson coefficients of -0.515, -0.577, -0.246 and 0.038 respectively. NDVI values had negatively linkage with NDBI. The Pearson's correlation coefficients in four seasons was -0.568, -0.582, -0.536 and -0.242, which indicated that NDVI could be used to characterize the evolution of urban construction land. The throughout study suggests that NDBI not only can be used as an important indicator to analyze LST and urban heat island effects, but also will provide a reliable basis for urban construction and planning.					; HUANG, FANG/JBS-3517-2023	Huang, Fang/0000-0001-5353-395X; 															978-1-4799-2763-0				2013							840	845																WOS:000341115000157

This study investigated seasonal HMs fluctuation in water and sediment by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. The vital physicochemical properties of water were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in summer, except for dissolved oxygen and NH3. HM concentrations in both water and sediment peaked in summer, followed by winter and monsoon. In water, Cd, Fe, Mn, and Ni were highest in summer, whereas Cu, Pb, Cr, and Zn were prominent in winter. Furthermore, Cu, Cr, Cd, Zn, and Mn were amplified in winter, while Fe, Pb, and Ni were elevated in summer sediment samples. Water quality indices-contamination index and HM evaluation index exceeded threshold limits in summer and winter, while HM pollution index remained high across all seasons. Sediment quality assessment indices i.e., geo-accumulation index indicated unpolluted to moderate pollution by Cd, while pollution load index demonstrated an overall unpolluted status. Cd was extremely enriched, with low to high ecological risk. Health risk analysis indicated that children are more vulnerable to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects. A comprehensive framework requires seasonal monitoring, pollution control, and regional cooperation to sustainably reduce HMs pollution.					Hossain, Mohammad Amzad/ITV-5129-2023; Sultana, Mst.

The common species are Peridinium gatunense, Peridiniopsis borgei, Ps. elpatiewskyi, Ps. cunningtonii and Ceratium hirundinella. The species present in the lake are forms with a wide range of geographical distribution. The development of the vegetative cells and their bloom occur in similar environmental conditions in Lake Kinneret and in temperate water bodies. The unfavourable conditions for the vegetative cells are in summer in the subtropical lake and in winter in temperate zones. Thus, the cysts of P. gatunense, Peridiniopsis spp. and C. hirundinella are "oversummering" forms in Lake Kinneret and "overwintering" ones in temperate water bodies.																			0003-9136					JAN	1991	120	3					267	285																WOS:A1991EX90500002

In summer, archaeaplankton abundance generally decreased in Dianchi Lake but increased in Erhai Lake, while archaeaplankton diversity increased in both lakes. These two lakes had distinct archaeaplankton community structure. Archaeaplankton abundance was influenced by organic content, while trophic status determined archaeaplankton diversity and structure. Moreover, in summer, lake sediment archaeal abundance considerably decreased. Sediment archaeal abundance showed a remarkable spatial change in spring but only a slight one in summer. The evident spatial change of sediment archaeal diversity occurred in both seasons. In Dianchi Lake, sediment archaeal community structure in summer was remarkably different from that in spring. Compared to Erhai Lake, Dianchi Lake had relatively high sediment archaeal abundance but low diversity. These two lakes differed remarkably in sediment archaeal community structure. Trophic status determined sediment archaeal abundance, diversity and structure. Archaeal diversity in sediment was much higher than that in water. Water and sediment habitats differed greatly in archaeal community structure. Euryarchaeota predominated in water column, but showed much lower proportion in sediment. Bathyarchaeota was an important component of sediment archaeal community.					; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008; liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019; Wu, Zhen/GZG-5518-2022	Wu, Zhen/0000-0001-8474-4274; Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080; 														1664-302X				MAR 31	2016	7								451	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00451	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00451								27065997					WOS:000373278100002
J	Bohman, IM; Herrmann, J				Bohman, IM; Herrmann, J			The timing of winter-growing shredder species and leaf litter turnover rate in an oligotrophic lake, SE Sweden	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small freshwater systems often depend on allochthonous organic subsidies to sustain productivity. Benthic invertebrates consuming coarse detritus maintain the energy flow by conveying dead organic matter into prey items and increase the food availability for other consumers. Compared to lotic systems, the dynamics of coarse detritus decomposition has not received much attention in lakes. The objectives of this study were to investigate the seasonality of leaf litter turnover and the timing of abundance of potential shredder species in a typical oligotrophic boreal lake. Leaf litter was experimentally exposed in litterbags in the littoral zone in Lake Valen from autumn to late spring two consecutive years. The weight loss rate of leaf litter initially followed the same pattern during both winter periods, but was markedly influenced by freezing in late winter the second year. Further, the seasonal variation patterns in abundance in litterbags were quite different among the potential shredder species. Only the limnephilid caddis larvae showed a density variation pattern possible to connect to the weight loss of leaf litter in litterbags. Otherwise frequent detritivores such as Asellus aquaticus and Leptophlebia marginata displayed lowest density in litterbags during the main weight loss period. However, after the long ice period the second winter the remaining leaf litter seemed to be consumed by A. aquaticus. With increasing knowledge of the initial leaf breakdown process and the guild of shredders in lakes, the decomposition rate may also in this habitat become a useful instrument when evaluating the impact from perturbations on ecosystem function.																			0018-8158					FEB	2006	556						99	108		10.1007/s10750-005-1052-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1052-1													WOS:000234198800008
J	Zingel, P; Noges, T				Zingel, Priit; Noges, Tiina			Seasonal and annual population dynamics of ciliates in a shallow eutrophic lake	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal population dynamics and community composition of planktonic ciliates were studied for over a decade in a naturally eutrophic shallow lake, Lake Vortsjarv, which has a large open surface area (270 km(2) on average) and highly turbid water (Secchi depth < 1 m). Our aim was to follow the seasonal and annual succession of planktonic ciliates and to analyse the factors controlling their development. Study material was collected from January 1995 to December 2007. The ciliate biomass was relatively high, accounting for more than 60 % of the total zooplankton biomass. We found a recurrent pattern in ciliate seasonal dynamics. Abundance peaked in spring (May) and reached its maximum in late summer (July, August). Large sized nanovorous oligotrichs dominated in spring. The summer peak was made up of small scuticociliates and oligotrichs, feeding mainly on picoplankton. A minor ciliate peak was also found in autumn (October); during this period when the community was dominated by species feeding on both pico- and nanoplankton. The highest biomass values were not always coupled with the peak abundances, but with the occurrence of large (empty set > 300 mu m) gymnostomes. There was a positive correlation between ciliates and phyto- and bacterioplankton, implying that the ciliates were clearly bottom-up or food-controlled. This was further confirmed by the positive correlation between ciliates and metazooplankton. As both bacteria and phytoplankton are coupled with resuspension of lake sediments, the large fluctuations in water level influenced the ciliate community biomass annually.

Although sample to sample variation was high, seasonal trends were discernible for several ions. Annual mean concentrations of H+, NO3-, and SO42- were low and quite constant until 1981, but increased dramatically in 1982. Hydrogen ion concentration increased by an average of 0.63 .mu.Eq .cntdot. L-1 over this period. The order of annual average cation dominance was Ca2+ > NH4+ > H+ > Mg2+ > K+. The dominant anion was SO42-, followed by NO3- > Cl-. Calcium, Mg2-, SO42-, Si, suspended P and N, total dissolved P and N, and total ionic concentrations were greatest in spring and fall, correlating with periods of maximum agricultural activity on the prairies, over 250 km away. Concentrations of NO3- and H+ were higher in snow than in rain, while SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+ were greater in rain. The total deposition of most substances was higher in summer than in winter, because of the greater proportion of annual precipitation occurring in summer months. A comparison with other sites revealed higher Ca2+ and NH4+ at all sites near agricultural areas, and higher H+, SO42-, and NO3- at sites in eastern North America. A comparison of 1980 bulk versus wet-only chemistry indicated that dryfall contributed 52% of the total annual deposition of Cl-, 22% of the SO42- 0% of the NO3-, 48% of the Mg2+, 31% of the NH4+, 28% of the Ca2+, and 8% of the Na+. Charge balances were excellent for both wet and bulk samples.					Schindler, David/A-3752-2014														0706-652X	1205-7533					1987	44			1			206	214																WOS:A1987L149200021

Densities of Oligochaetes and Chironomids did not vary significantly from summer to winter, the latter not showing any recolonization of the profundal zone. Structure and diversity of the total fauna, and Oligochaete/Chironomid ratio were very similar in the two periods. Our results suggest that in a severely polluted lake, with a strong and lasting oxygen deficit in the hypolimnic zone, a lack of recovery of profundal macrobenthos may be expected in improved environmental winter conditions.																			0036-7842					DEC 30	1985	47	1					57	63		10.1007/BF02538184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02538184													WOS:A1985AXN8200006

Contributions of Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair Walleye Populations to the Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, Recreational Fishery: Evidence from Genetic Stock Identification	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Genetic stock identification analyses were conducted to determine spawning population contributions to the recreational fishery for Walleyes Sander vitreus in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Two spawning population groups were considered: (1) the Tittabawassee River, which has been identified as the largest source of spawning Walleyes for Saginaw Bay; and (2) an aggregate of six spawning populations from Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair that were found to be genetically similar. Overall, the Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair spawning populations were estimated to comprise approximately 26% of the Walleye recreational harvest in Saginaw Bay during 2008-2009. Contribution levels were similar for the 2 years in which genetic samples were collected. Contributions from the Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair spawning populations to the harvest of age-5 and older Walleyes were greater during summer (31.8%; SE = 6.2%) than during late winter and spring (6.0%; SE = 3.7%). Conversely, contributions from the Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair spawning populations to the harvest of age-3 and age-4 fish were fairly similar between seasons (late winter and spring: 31.2%, SE = 6.7%; summer: 41.7%, SE = 5.6%), suggesting that younger Walleyes migrate earlier or reside in Saginaw Bay for extended periods. Our finding that one-quarter of the Saginaw Bay recreational harvest of Walleyes comprises fish from Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair has important management implications, as policies for one lake may have bearing on the other lake-one of the challenges associated with managing migratory fish species. Fisheries management in the Laurentian Great Lakes has a history of being highly coordinated and cooperative among the states and province bordering the individual lakes. Results from this study suggest that cooperation may need to be expanded to account for fish movement between lakes.

Under-ice environmental conditions, planktonic communities and ichthyofauna in dystrophic lakes	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL												High content of humic substances and low pH values are factors limiting the species richness and abundance of some organisms in dystrophic lakes. Unfavourable winter conditions (i.e. low water temperature, poor light conditions, ice/snow cover) may additionally restrict their development. The aim of this study was to compare ice-on (winter) and ice-off (summer) abiotic (organic carbon, total phosphorus and nitrogen) and biotic (chlorophyll a, phytoplankton, ciliates, rotifers, crustaceans, fish) parameters in five dystrophic lakes of the Wigry National Park (north-east Poland). We tested the hypothesis that the abundance and diversity of planktonic organisms in dystrophic lakes could be lower in winter than in summer. Our results showed that the winter period, with ice and snow cover, was characterised by clearly higher oxygen concentrations, pH values and conductivity, but lower total phosphorus concentrations, species richness of phytoplankton, ciliates, rotifers and crustaceans, and phytoplankton to zooplankton biomass ratios in comparison to the summer. All of the studied groups of organisms, except rotifers, reached relatively high abundances and biomasses in both seasons and, in some lakes, they were higher in winter than in summer. Our results suggest that fish composition and abundance did not play an important role in structuring plankton communities. The small dystrophic lakes, although located close to one another, differed in terms of abiotic parameters and had specific species compositions of phyto- and zooplankton. Warmer winters, which are the result of climate change, may favour the intensive development of planktonic communities under the ice in dystrophic lakes of temperate climatic zones.					; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Kalinowska, Krystyna/S-8299-2018; Stawecki, Konrad/AAP-2235-2021	Stawecki, Konrad/0000-0002-8904-8996; Traczuk, Piotr/0000-0002-1130-569X; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290; Kalinowska, Krystyna/0000-0002-5099-5371; Ulikowski, Dariusz/0000-0002-4253-2852; Bogacka-Kapusta, Elzbieta/0000-0002-6146-5229; 													2475-0263					JAN 1	2021	88	1					340	351		10.1080/24750263.2021.1889054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24750263.2021.1889054													WOS:000626508500001
J	Tryfon, E; MoustakaGouni, M				Tryfon, E; MoustakaGouni, M			Species composition and seasonal cycles of phytoplankton with special reference to the nanoplankton of Lake Mikri Prespa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The phytoplankton of Lake Mikri Prespa was studied at monthly or biweekly intervals during the period May 1990-September 1992. Its species composition, consisting of a great number of cyanophytes and a very small number of chrysophytes and desmids, may reflect the eutrophic character of the lake. Moreover, the mean annual biomass values (15.0 and 3.2 g m(-3) in the two years, respectively) and the maximum biomass (38.1, 6.4 and 9.6 g m(-3)), classify Mikri Prespa as a eutrophic lake. A tendency towards a double-peaked pattern of biomass distribution in time with one peak in autumn, composed mainly of cyanophytes, and another in spring made up of diatoms, was observed. This pattern contrasts with the standard pattern in eutrophic, stratified temperate lakes, which exhibit a third biomass maximum in summer. Cyanophytes were the mast important group in terms of biomass and were dominated by the species Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis wesenbergii, Anabaena lemmermannii var. minor and Aphanocapsa elachista var. conferta. Diatoms constituted the second most important group, with main representative the species Cyclotella ocellata. Cyanophytes, diatoms, chlorophytes and dinophytes revealed annual periodicity whereas the other algal groups did not show any seasonality at all. The nanoplankton constituted an important part of algal biomass (38.9 and 49.9% in the two years, respectively) and revealed annual periodicity with maximum values in winter and spring, mainly composed of diatoms and cryptophytes. Low temperature, increased rainfall and high DIN concentrations seemed to be the main factors influencing the seasonality. Although the percentage contribution of nanoplankton decreased with the increase in total biomass, justifying the classification of Lake Mikri Prespa among the eutrophic lakes, the nanoplankton biomass did not correlate significantly with total phytoplankton biomass.

Arsenate, As(V), was predominant throughout the entire water column when the lake was well-mixed in winter. During summer stratification, arsenate disappeared in the epilimnion and was replaced by arsenite, As(III), but in the anoxic hypolimnion As(V) remained the dominant species. Reduction of As(V) in the hypolimnion occurred only late in the stagnation phase, in the presence of sulfide. The dominant redox reactions of inorganic As in the epilimnion were biologically mediated reduction by phytoplankton in summer and oxidation of As(III) by Mn oxides in fall. Approximately 50% of total dissolved As in the epilimnion and hypolimnion was refractory to the direct hydride generation method. The composition of particles, collected regularly in sediment traps, indicated that Fe oxides were the main scavengers for inorganic As. Nevertheless sedimentation was only a minor sink of inorganic As.

Growth responses of tropical cladocerans to seston from Lake Monte Alegre (Brazil) supplemented with phosphorus, fatty acids, a green algae and a cyanobacterium	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The cladocerans Ceriodaphnia richardi, Daphnia ambigua, D. gessneri and Moina micrura were used to access food quality of Lake Monte Alegre's seston. Experiments were carried out in summer and autumn as growth assays with lake seston only (control) and seston supplemented with phosphate, fatty acids or Synechococcus, and Scenedesmus. In summer, high C:P ratios in seston suggested strong phosphorus limitation, however, contrary to the expectations of stoichiometric theory, the addition of phosphate to seston did not improve cladoceran growth. Addition of PUFA increased growth rates and clutch size of D. gessneri, suggesting a possible deficiency in essential fatty acids in summer. Addition of Scenedesmus increased significantly growth rates of the cladocerans D. gessneri and C. cornuta, suggesting energy limitation in summer. In autumn, C:P ratios were lower than in summer, but still above the threshold ratio for Daphnia. At this time, addition of phosphate increased significantly growth rates of Daphnia suggesting strong P limitation, especially in D. gessneri. However, energy limitation was still important in autumn, as suggested by a further increase in growth rates in +Syn and +Sce treatments. Energy limitation was especially strong for Moina micrura, which is a fast-growing species, with high P content. Algal digestion resistance is a plausible hypothesis for energy limitation, since carbon concentrations in both seasons were above incipient limiting levels. These results show that the seston C:P ratio was not a consistent predictor of cladoceran P limitation and that factors other than P and energy limitation seem to be also important, such as PUFA or other biochemical factors.					; Ferrão-Filho, Aloysio/E-2655-2014	Ferrao-Filho, Aloysio da S./0000-0002-8833-1597; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2006	563						155	165		10.1007/s10750-005-0001-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-0001-3													WOS:000237552100013

The 557 hosts analysed in this study were trapped seasonally between autumn 2002 and summer 2005 across 6 habitat types. Twelve helminth species were detected among which, Taenia parva larvae, Angiostrongylus dujardini, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Syphacia stroma and S. frederici constitute the component species, accounting for 98.7% of all worms. H. polygyrus was the most prevalent helminth parasite. Species richness varied according to habitat and season. The highest species richness was found in sand dunes during winter whereas the lowest was detected along lake margins also during the winter. Some differences in prevalence and mean intensity values were found in relation to year (T parva larvae and H. polygyrus), habitat (A. dujardini), season (T parva larvae, H. polygyrus, A. dujardini and S. stroma) and host sex (T. parva larvae and S. stroma).

Weirs on Kodiak Island, around Prince William Sound, and near Juneau, Alaska, were used to capture Dolly Varden as they emigrated td the sea each spring. Dolly Varden (greater than or equal to 200 mm fork length) were individually marked during the first year of each experiment (1989 or 1990), and log-linear models of their capture histories were used to estimate probabilities of capture during the second year (1990 or 1991). Our observations on timing of spring emigration and dispersal of Dolly Varden at sea confirm observations from earlier studies. Our results support the paradigm that Dolly Varden home to the same lacustrine watershed when overwintering in fresh water, as more than 98% of the recaptured fish did so. Our results contradicted the paradigm that Dolly Varden return to lakes each fall, for across study populations, 14-58% failed to return. The most probable explanation for this anomalous behavior is that some Dolly Varden spend the winter at sea. Differences in maturity, size, and growth of Dolly Varden and timing of their entrance into salt water during spring emigration were excluded as causes of this anomalous behavior.																			0002-8487					MAY	1995	124	3					297	307		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0297:STOTMH>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0297:STOTMH>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QW86900002

Once the radionuclides became mixed throughout the water column with autumn turnover, other biota were exposed to the radionuclides. In general, Co-60 concentrations in biota were low because of the rapid loss to the sediments. Exceptions were for initial Co-60 concentrations in filter-feeders (cladocerans and clams) during autumn turnover. Concentrations of Cs-134 were higher in biota the following spring and summer, reflecting the tendency of Cs-134 to remain in the water column. Concentrations of Cs-134 Still continued to increase in forage fish 1 year following the radionuclide addition. The addition of radionuclides to the hypolimnion resulted in higher concentrations in forage fish than when added to the epilimnion. Radionuclide concentrations in biota varied with taxon and were greatest in periphyton. This study demonstrates that radionuclides that may enter the bottom waters of a lake as a result of nuclear fuel waste disposal will be available to biota and result in a radiation dose to aquatic biota and to humans via the water-fish-human pathway.																			0706-652X					APR	1998	55	4					987	998		10.1139/cjfas-55-4-987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-4-987													WOS:000074671600023

Long-term seasonal effects of dreissenid mussels on phytoplankton in Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada	INLAND WATERS												The invasion of dreissenid mussels to Lake Simcoe coincided with notable changes in the ecosystem, including a period of lower phytoplankton biovolume, particularly at shallower sites. Dreissenid grazing effects are typically most prominent during the summer season in the nearshore areas of lakes. Grazing effects in the winter are small because dreissenid filtration rates, especially those of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), decrease in cold temperatures. Phytoplankton dynamics in the winter season are poorly characterized, particularly in lakes that experience ice cover. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of dreissenids on the seasonality of phytoplankton dynamics in the nearshore waters of the lake using long-term monitoring data from unchlorinated water treatment plant (WTP) intake pipes. The long-term dataset from the WTPs showed significant and sustained declines in phytoplankton biovolumes and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations in the 12-year period following the invasion of dreissenid mussels to Lake Simcoe. The decline was smallest during the ice-covered winter months (Jan-Mar). The fall phytoplankton peak observed in the pre-dreissenid years shifted to a smaller peak during the winter in post-dreissenid years. We hypothesized that reduced dreissenid grazing pressure during the winter, and possible improved under-ice light conditions that we attribute to climate change, may be contributing to this shift. Phytoplankton biovolume data collection continues to be important in Lake Simcoe as a measure of phytoplankton biomass. Our results also indicate that winter phytoplankton biovolumes should be considered when managing lakes experiencing both climate change and dreissenid mussel effects.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2013	3	2					285	296		10.5268/IW-3.2.527	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-3.2.527													WOS:000318267500013
J	Bell, EM; Laybourn-Parry, J				Bell, EM; Laybourn-Parry, J			The plankton community of a young, eutrophic, Antarctic saline lake	POLAR BIOLOGY												A shallow, saline lake (Rookery Lake) close to the sea and surrounded by a penguin rookery was investigated during the austral spring and summer of 1996/1997. The proximity to the sea means that the lake is likely to have been formed recently during isostatic uplift. Inputs of carbon and nutrients from the penguin rookery have rendered Rookery Lake eutrophic compared with other brackish and saline lakes in the Vestfold Hills. Chlorophyll a concentration, bacterioplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellate and phototrophic nanoflagellate abundances were all significantly higher than in other non-enriched lakes. The high productivity created seasonal anoxia during winter and spring below ice cover. The ciliate community resembled the marine community, and was dissimilar to that seen in older saline lakes within the Vestfold Hills. Thus Rockery Lake provides valuable evidence of the impact of natural eutrophication on an Antarctic lake, as well as of the evolution of the typical microbial community which dominates the older lakes of the Vestfold Hills.																			0722-4060					OCT	1999	22	4					248	253		10.1007/s003000050417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003000050417													WOS:000082423100004
J	Ha, K; Jang, MH; Joo, GJ				Ha, K; Jang, MH; Joo, GJ			Spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton communities along a regulated river system, the Nakdong River, Korea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The longitudinal distribution and seasonal fluctuation of phytoplankton communities was studied along the middle to lower part of a regulated river system (Nakdong River, Korea). Phytoplankton biomass decreased sharply in the middle part of the river (182 km upward the estuary dam), and then increased downstream reaching a maximum at the last sampling station (27 km upward the estuary dam). In contrast, there was little downstream fluctuation in species composition, irrespective of pronounced differences in nutrient concentrations (TN, TP, NO3, NH4, PO4) as well as in algal biomass. In the main river channel, small centric diatoms ( Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Cyclotella meneghiniana) and pennate diatoms ( Synedra, Fragilaria, Nitzschia) were dominant from winter to early spring (November-April). A mixed community of cryptomonads, centric and pennate diatoms, and coenobial greens ( Pediastrum, Scenedesmus) was dominant in late spring (May-June). Blue-green algae (Anabaena, Microcystis, Oscillatoria) were dominant in the summer (July-September). A mid-summer Microcystis bloom occurred at all study sites during the dry season, when discharge was low, though the nutrient concentration varied in each study site. Nutrients appeared everywhere to be in excess of algal requirement and apparently did not influence markedly the downstream and seasonal phytoplankton compositional differences in this river.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2002	470	1-3					235	245		10.1023/A:1015610900467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1015610900467													WOS:000175854800022
J	HAMR, P; BERRILL, M				HAMR, P; BERRILL, M			THE LIFE HISTORIES OF NORTH-TEMPERATE POPULATIONS OF THE CRAYFISH CAMBARUS-ROBUSTUS AND CAMBARUS-BARTONI	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The life histories of the crayfish Cambarus robustus and Cambarus bartoni were studied in the Kawartha Lakes region of southern Ontario [Canada]. There were marked differences in their breeding and molting cycles compared with the familiar pattern of the Orconectes species of this region. Egg extrusion occurred later (July in C. robustus, June in C. bartoni), and juveniles therefore did not become free living until late summer or early fall. With little growing time in their first summer, they measured only 5-10 mm in carapace length (CPL) before growth ceased for the winter. At the end of their second summer the still immature crayfish measured 17-26 mm CPL in C. robustus and 13-20 mm CPL in C. bartoni. Maturity was therefore not attained until the end of the third summer, when most C. robustus matured at 34-45 mm CPL and C. bartoni at 25-30 mm CPL. The majority of individuals apparently reproduced for the first time during their fourth summer; a few apparently survived into another summer, reaching carapace lengths greater than 50 mm in C. robustus and 30 mm in C. bartoni. In males of both species, form 1 and form 2 occur throughout the summer. Although lacking the synchrony of Orconectes species, breeding and molting activities are still confined to the period between April and October. The timing of the life-history events observed in these two Cambarus species may be adaptations to seasonal stresses of the swift water environments that these species inhabit as well as to the relative harshness of the northern temperate climate.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	10					2313	2322		10.1139/z85-343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-343													WOS:A1985AUC7700013

When it snows it pours: Increased chloride concentrations in the Cuyahoga River during the last half century	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Road salt (NaCl, halite) use in areas with substantial snowfall has increased dramatically since the mid-20th century. However, few studies on chloride loading to the Laurentian Great Lakes or Ohio rivers have been conducted. To that end, we analyzed long-term (1972-2019) chloride data across 10 watersheds obtained as part of the Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program (HTLP) for the Lake Erie, Ohio River, and Grand Lake St. Marys watersheds and found that the Cuyahoga River, which has the greatest percent urban land use, had the highest watershed yield and mean concentrations of chloride for any of the HTLP rivers. Further, we apportioned the data seasonally to determine if river chloride levels were greater during seasons of road salt application (Winter) and snowmelt (Spring). Seasonally, winter levels of chloride exceeded the USEPA chronic water quality criteria concentration of 230 mg/L in more than half of the years of the 21st century, compared to only 1 year exceeding this value in the late 20th century. Further, road salt application is increasing with time in the Cuyahoga, Maumee, and Sandusky River watersheds. This increase is significantly and positively related to winter, spring, and fall mean chloride concentrations in the Cuyahoga River and winter mean chloride concentrations in the Maumee River. Finally, chloride-to-sulfate mass ratios (CSMR) for the Cuyahoga River almost always exceeded the 0.5 value that promotes corrosivity of metal pipes and are increasing with time. Ways to minimize the use of or even replace road salt as a deicer are warranted. (C) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Mendonça, HS; Santos, ACA; Martins, MM; Araújo, FG				Mendonca, Helaine Silva; Alcantara Santos, Alexandre Clistenes; Martins, Mariana Marques; Araujo, Francisco Gerson			Size-related and seasonal changes in the diet of the non-native Cichla kelberi Kullander & Ferreira, 2006 in a lowland reservoir in the southeastern Brazil	BIOTA NEOTROPICA												We examined size-related and seasonal changes in the diet of the peacock bass Cichla kelberi in a tropical lowland reservoir in southeastern Brazil over three hydro-climatic seasons: summer (high rainfall and temperature), winter (low rainfall and temperature), and late spring (increasing rainfall and temperature) during two years (2006-2007). The tested hypothesis is that this non-native predator fish changes diet during the subadult and adult phases and among seasons to adapt in new colonized environment. Fishes of the families Clupeidae (Platanichthys platana), Characidae (Astyanax spp.) and Cichlidae (Cichla kelberi) were the most important food items, followed by insects of the order Odonata. Cannibalism was also recorded for the largest individuals. A significant size-related change in diet was found with the smallest individuals (Total Length, TL < 20 cm) preying mainly on fishes, whereas the larger individuals (TL > 30 cm) preyed mainly on Odonata. The niche breadth increased during growth, with the largest individuals having a diet more evenly distributed among the available resources. No significant seasonal differences in diet composition were found, but stomachs with higher degree of volume occupied by food were more frequent in late spring than in summer. Conversely, the highest niche breadth was found during the summer compared to the other seasons. Together, these observations suggest an efficient use of the available resources by this top predator in this new colonized system.					de Alcantara santos, Alexandre/C-3999-2018	Araujo, Francisco Gerson/0000-0003-4551-1974													1676-0603						2018	18	3							e20170493	10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2017-0493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2017-0493													WOS:000439226300001
J	Shrimpton, JM				Shrimpton, JM			Relationship between size, gill corticosteroid receptors, Na+-K+ ATPase activity and smolting in juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in autumn and spring	AQUACULTURE												Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) normally develop an increase in saltwater tolerance during the spring as part of the parr-smolt transformation. It has been observed that coho salmon also show increased saltwater tolerance in the autumn preceding smelting. To determine whether the high salt water tolerance observed during the autumn was similar to that occurring during smelting in the spring, a group of coho reared in lake net pens in British Columbia, Canada, were sampled from June through to the following May. Changes in gill Na+-K+ ATPase activity, plasma cortisol and gill cytosolic corticosteroid receptor (CR) concentration (B-max) and dissociation constant (k(D)) were examined. Fish examined in this study showed great variation in body size. By the November after hatch, some individuals in the population were greater than 100 g and developed silver coloration characteristic of smelts. In contrast, the smallest fish in the population were approximately 10 g in November and exhibited distinct parr marks, An intermediate group also existed that were smaller than the large fish in November and March, yet were beginning to silver and exhibited less distinct parr marks. Large fish exhibited significantly increased gill Na+-K+ ATPase activity in both the autumn and spring compared to the levels found in parr, Concomitant to the changes in Na+-K+ ATPase activity were an increase in plasma cortisol concentration, a decrease in CR B-max and an increase in k(D). Increases in k(D) were positively correlated with Na+-K+ ATPase activity. Small- and medium-sized fish only showed the changes in gill Na+-K+ ATPase activity associated with smelting during the second spring. This study showed that physiological changes associated with smelting occurred in November and May in a population of coho salmon. The accelerated rate of smelt development allowed earlier transfer of fish to salt water in November.																			0044-8486					NOV 20	1996	147	1-2					127	140		10.1016/S0044-8486(96)01390-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(96)01390-7													WOS:A1996VZ85300010
J	Traunspurger, W				Traunspurger, W			Distribution, seasonal occurrence and vertical pattern of Tobrilus gracilis (Bastian, 1865) and T-medius (Schneider, 1916)	NEMATOLOGICA												The autecology of Tobrilus gracilis (n = 1705 individuals) and T. medius (n = 298 individuals), two common nematode species of Lake Konigssee, was studied throughout the year 1986. T. gracilis comprised 3.5% of all nematodes in the littoral, 6.3% in the littoriprofundal and 2.7% in the profundal. T. medius comprised 0.3% of all nematodes in the littoral, 1.4% in the littoriprofundal and 3.3% in the profundal. The species contributed to a considerable portion of nematode biomass in Lake Konigssee. Mean yearly biomass of T. gracilis was greatest at 1 m depth (0.52 mg/100 cm(2) ww; 65% of total nematode biomass) and of T. medius at 60 m depth (0.2 mg/100 cm(2) ww; 49% of total nematode biomass). Density of T. gracilis peaked twice a year in 1 m water depth (winter and summer) and once in deeper regions (winter/spring). T. medius peaked once a year in 10 m depth (spring), showed no distinct maximum in 30 m depth and reached higher numbers in 60 m depth in winter. There was considerable water depth- and time-dependent variation in sex ratios of ?: gracilis. The main reproductive period seemed to be different for the investigated depths. The proportion of individuals of T. gracilis in the top sediment layer was about 57% and of T. medius about 72%. Juveniles and adults of T. gracilis were partially segregated in the sediment column. Morphometric data of both species revealed sexual dimorphism in size, body shape and weight.

In this paper, solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were utilized to analyze the fugitive characteristics of 10 antibiotics of sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfadimidine, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole) and tetracyclines (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and doxycycline) in the coastal waters and surfece sediments of the Yangtze River Estuary and the ecological risks of antibiotics in water were estimated using ecological risk assessment method. The results have showed that 7 of the 10 antibiotics were detected in the water, with total concentrations ranging from 0.652 to 434.47 ng/L. 8 antibiotics were detected in the sediment, with total concentrations ranging from 0.091 to 499.23 ng/g. The main antibiotic species detected in the sediment and water varied seasonally. Higher concentrations in spatially distributed areas where rivers meet and where human activities have a more significant impact. The ecological risks were found to be higher in spring and autumn than those in winter and summer. Spatial variation in individual microbial communities was not evident in the sediments. The relationship between antibiotics and microorganisms in the environment was predominantly positive. Physical and chemical factors were significantly correlated for both antibiotics and microbial communities. This study can provide research ideas for other types of antibiotics and provide a basis for the prevention of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).					; Nikitina, Elena/AAN-9954-2020; Li, Xin/I-5450-2018	Nikitina, Elena/0000-0003-2431-8999; Xu, Qiuhong/0000-0001-5901-4456													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2023	30	56					118567	118587		10.1007/s11356-023-30698-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-30698-z		NOV 2023						37917269					WOS:001097887000006

PAHs flux of atmospheric deposition and the impact on the PAHs in the lake water column were estimated. The major sources of PAHs were identified by multiple methods. We found that (1) the seasonal residual levels of 16 priority controlled PAHs (PAH(16)) were spring (8.89 +/- 3.93 mu g g(-1)) > summer (6.68 +/- 4.31 mu g g(-1)) > winter (6.06 +/- 2.95 mu g g(-1)) > autumn (3.55 +/- 2.21 mu g g(-1)). (2) Significant positive correlations were found between the PAH levels in the dustfall and the suspended particle material (SPM) content, as well as between the deposition flux and the PAH content in the water in all four seasons. (3) Vehicle emissions, coal combustion, biomass combustion, and coke ovens were the four major sources in Lake Chaohu, accounting for 12.7%, 40.9%, 14.5%, and 31.9% of the total PAHs, respectively.

J	Tahroudi, MN; Pourreza-Bilondi, M; Ramezani, Y				Tahroudi, Mohammad Nazeri; Pourreza-Bilondi, Mohsen; Ramezani, Yousef			Toward coupling hydrological and meteorological drought characteristics in Lake Urmia Basin, Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Investigation of precipitation characteristics on daily, monthly, and annual time scales can contribute to gaining important information related to temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation or even flow rate challenges (e.g., hydrological droughts). The low levels of long-term precipitation and high variability in different time scales are considered the main inherent characteristics of climate in Iran. Due to the direct effects of precipitation on water resources, especially on the river flow rate, it is necessary to assess the efficient indices to visualize the variations in the components of water resources. One of the main indices is the precipitation concentration index (PCI) which is known as a strong indicator of the precipitation distribution generally used on annual and seasonal scales. In this study, drought analysis in the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) located in northwest of Iran was performed with the daily river flow rate and monthly precipitation values within the period of 1984-2013. The results of changes in precipitation indicated that the irregularity of precipitation distribution had grown in spring months. Also, due to the diminishing precipitation trend on the annual time scale, PCI index also increased. It is concluded that LUB detected a significant descending trend on the annual, spring, and winter time scales in the last 30 years. The PCI values were proved high irregularity in summer with PCI amount of 20.1 and most regularity in winter with PCI amount of 10.4. This paper also aims to assess the effects of PCI on the river flow rate along with the flow shortness volume values using hydrometric and rain gauge stations within LUB. The results obtained from the changes in river flow rate and flow shortness volume revealed that the river flow rate has mostly a falling trend. Finally, it was observed that the time when the river flow rate data changed happened after beginning of changes in the precipitation data. A decrease in inflow from 900 million cubic meters up to 14 billion cubic meters with high flow shortness volume may happen in worst conditions. These results highlighted the importance of applying water resources management in LUB.

J	Kim, HW; Joo, GJ				Kim, HW; Joo, GJ			The longitudinal distribution and community dynamics of zooplankton in a regulated large river: a case study of the Nakdong River (Korea)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The longitudinal distribution and seasonal dynamics of zooplankton were examined along a 200-km section of the middle to lower Nakdong River, Korea. Zooplankton was sampled twice a month from January 1995 to December 1997 at five sites in the main river channel. There was considerable longitudinal variation in total zooplankton abundance (ANOVA, p < 0.001). All major zooplankton groups (rotifers, cladocerans, copepodids and nauplii) increased significantly with distance downstream along the river. There also were statistically significant seasonal differences in zooplankton abundance at the sampling sites (ANOVA, p < 0.01). Zooplankton abundance was high in spring and fall and low in summer and winter. The seasonal pattern of rotifers was similar to that of total zooplankton. This reflected the fact that rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus, B. rubens, Keratella cochlearis and Polyarthra spp.) strongly dominated the zooplankton community at all locations. Among the macrozooplankton, small-bodied cladocerans (e.g. Bosmina spp.) dominated; the abundance of large-bodied cladocerans (e.g. Daphnia) was negligible (0-5 ind. l(-1)). Among the environmental variables considered, partial residence time seemed to play the most important role in determining characteristics of the river zooplankton community.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2000	438	1-3					171	184		10.1023/A:1004185216043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004185216043													WOS:000166048100014

While heavy metals concentrations in the water samples were decreased as Zn > Cr > Ni Ph > Mn > Cu > Cd, in sediment samples were Mn > Zn > Ni > Cu > Cr > Ph > Cd, respectively. Generally, heavy metals concentrations in the plant tissues were decreased in sequence of Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cr > Ph > Cd. It was determined that Cu, Mn and Zn were actively transported to the root, where they were accumulated especially in autumn. Lower accumulation factor ratios were seen in spring than other seasons. Cd exhibited a relatively clear pattern of increasing accumulation in P. lucens with increasing sediment metal concentrations. Significant positive correlations were observed between Cr, Cu, Ni and Cd contents in sediment and Cd contents in root of P. lucens. The investigations suggested that Ni and Mn have a tendency to be accumulated in leaf especially in autumn and Cr and Cd to be accumulated in shoot especially in summer. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hampton, SE				Hampton, SE			Increased niche differentiation between two Conochilus species over 33 years of climate change and food web alteration	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Long-term data from Lake Washington are used to ask whether zooplankton population dynamics can be predicted on the basis of abiotic gradients and potential food resources. I used Dynamic Linear Models to examine effects of fluctuations in temperature and five algal groups on population dynamics of two rotifer species over a 33-yr period in which climate has warmed, anthropogenic nutrient loading has changed dramatically, and Daphnia has become established. Dynamics of the colonial rotifers Conochilus hippocrepis and Conochilus unicornis were both best predicted by temperature and the density of single-celled bacterio- and phytoplankton smaller than 10 mu m, but their seasonal peaks have become dramatically offset toward fall and spring, respectively, in recent years. Both species have been extirpated from the summer months in which they once flourished, seemingly because of midsummer declines in their food resources, which have been depressed by Daphnia since its establishment. However, climate warming has increased the length of the plankton growing season in Lake Washington, such that spring and fall offer greater abundance of food resources for Conochilus, offsetting modern exclusion of Conochilus from midsummer months. Additionally, greater distinction in temporal niches presumably has reduced possibilities for intrageneric competition, and both Conochilus species have achieved higher mean annual abundances in recent years.

J	Zhang, XK; Cai, LN; Yu, MH; Tang, R				Zhang, Xinkai; Cai, Lina; Yu, Menghan; Tang, Rong			Study on the Typical Environmental Factors in the Middle Part of Zhoushan Fishery Based on HY-1C/D and Other Multi-Source Data	WATER												This study utilizes satellite data, including HY-1C/D, along with reanalysis data, to unveil the typical environmental characteristics of the sea surface in the middle of Zhoushan fishery. The article addresses three main issues. The first one is the development of an ocean primary productivity (OPP) inversion algorithm model. The second one is the study of chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) concentration and OPP distribution characteristics in Zhoushan fishery using China's domestically produced ocean satellite HY-1C/D CZI data. The last one is the revelation of the characteristics of typical environmental factors on the sea surface at Zhoushan fishery by combining HY-1C/D with multi-source data. The results show the following: (1) The middle part of Zhoushan fishery exhibits significant seasonal and regional variations in Chl-alpha concentration and OPP. Chl-alpha concentration ranges mainly between 0.2 and 2.9 mu g/L, with higher concentrations in spring and summer and lower Chl-alpha concentrations in autumn and winter. Spatially, Chl-alpha concentration gradually decreases from west to east. The OPP in the study area ranges from 100 mg<middle dot>m-2d-1 to 1000 mg<middle dot>m-2d-1, with high OPP values distributed on the western side, ranging from 400 mg<middle dot>m-2d-1 to 1000 mg<middle dot>m-2d-1, and gradually decreasing seaward. The highest OPP occurs in summer and the lowest in winter. (2) The correlation analysis between Chl-alpha concentration and OPP revealed a strong positive relationship. Consequently, this study developed an empirical model for estimating OPP based on Chl-alpha concentration and validated its feasibility. The model applies to areas with Chl-alpha concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 4 mu g/L. (3) The convergence of freshwater injection, multiple ocean currents, and seasonal upwelling in the study area brings about a rich supply of nutrients. Additionally, the region is characterized by suitable conditions, including optimal Chl-alpha concentrations, OPP, SST, salinity, currents, and geological water depths. The synergistic effect of these factors together contributed to the formation of Zhoushan fishery.																				2073-4441				MAY	2024	16	10							1387	10.3390/w16101387	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16101387													WOS:001231323300001

Intensity of feeding is lowered prior to spawning. Zooplankton is the major food, and no evidence of predation on the eggs or young of sport fishes was found. Fish were found in the stomachs of 11% of the females and 4.3% of the males and were mainly young-of-the-year smelt in summer and lake emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides) in winter and spring. Fish were eaten only by smelt of age groups I-V (156-204 mm in fork length) while crustaceans were the principal food of young-of-the-year smelt.																			0008-3550						1979	93	3					266	271																WOS:A1979HE56700006

However, long-term changes in DON concentrations in eutrophic lakes have been poorly documented, and the particulate-related internal cycling of DON at the molecular level remains unclear. In this study, changes in the concentration of DON during the past 14 years of Lake Taihu, China were analyzed. Algae and sediment suspensions were incubated under summer sunlight to examine transformations of DON (e.g., photodissolution) at the bulk concentration and molecular level. Concentrations of DON in Lake Taihu ranged from 0 to 4.59 mg L-1, with a mean of 0.82 +/- 0.60 mg L-1 (n = 3360). Although annual averages of the concentration of DON (n = 240) showed no significant linear variation from 2005 to 2018, the percentage of DON in total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) increased linearly (p < .05) and was maintained at >50% after 2015. Seasonally, DON concentrations were highest in spring (1.10 +/- 0.56 mg L-1), followed by winter (0.87 +/- 0.58 mg L-1) and summer (0.54 +/- 0.37 mg L-1) concentrations, and lowest in autumn (0.44 +/- 0.38 mg L-1). Outdoor incubation experiments suggest that both algae and sediment suspensions contribute to significant increases of DON concentrations but contribute to decreases of inorganic N concentrations at the end of incubations. Moreover, the production of DON by algae suspensions differed from that of sediment suspensions, with more labile components released from algae (e.g., proteins and amino acids), while more refractory components were released from sediment suspensions (e.g., lignin with low H/C and O/C). Taken together, these results emphasize the increasing percentage of DON in TDN during 2009-2018 and the different patterns of algae- and sediment-dominated internal DON transformations in Lake Taihu.

The catchement is composed of granite, plagioclase and micaschists containing considerable amounts of sulphur, with little soil cover. The lake is ice covered for about nine months, during this time the deepest layers (>16m) become anoxic. During summer overturn, alkalinity (ALK) is lowest (-8 mu eq l(-1)) in the whole water column, whereas pH reaches its minimum (4.88) at the surface during snowmelt. A decrease of pH from 5.8 to 5.4 during winter is caused by CO2 oversaturation, but deep water ALK increases to up to 130 mu eq l(-1) due to in-lake ALK generation by reductive processes and base cation (BC) release. The seasonal pattern of ALK in SOS is driven by in-lake processes in winter, the snowmelting in spring and watershed processes and precipitation during summer. Since 1989 summer sulfate concentrations in SOS, originating mainly from the catchment show a tendency to increase presumably caused by enhanced weathering. In contrast, SO42-. concentrations in other high mountain lakes which are dominated by atmospheric depositions show a decreasing trend. SOS is a good example for the complexity of interactions between catchment and in-lake processes which act at different time scales and depend on climate changes and atmospheric inputs.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					359	364		10.1007/BF00476855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476855													WOS:A1995UB05300013

One of the important variables in this context is precipitation. The investigation of precipitation, one of the most important meteorological factors directly affecting accessibility to water resources, is of special importance. In every region, studies of precipitation on daily, monthly, or annual scales provide important information on the distribution, concentration, and dispersion of precipitation, as well as some conclusions about the associated hydrological problems. In this study, the precipitation concentration was calculated and zoned by means of the precipitation concentration index (PCI) in the basin of Lake Urmia, using monthly and annual rainfall data of 42 selected rain gauge stations, from which 24 stations located in the West Azerbaijan province (in the west of Lake Urmia) and 18 stations located in the East Azerbaijan province (in the east of Lake Urmia) during 1984-2013. The results of the studies of the precipitation concentration index over the basin of Lake Urmia showed that the dominant concentrations of spring, autumn, and winter precipitation were moderate, indicating a moderate distribution for the precipitation of the months in these seasons. In addition, in the period under study, uniform and regular precipitation concentrations (PCI<10) were observed only in winter and in the borders of the basin. In summer, almost the entire surface of the basin (excluding its northeastern part) faced a strongly irregular distribution of precipitation, indicating irregular rainfall in July, August, and September. Most of the basin of Lake Urmia is covered by an irregular distribution of precipitation on an annual scale. By investigating the precipitation distribution in the first and the last 10 years of the statistical period considered and by comparing them, it was revealed that the greatest increase in the precipitation concentration index was in autumn, it rose by approximately 20.55 percent. According to the results, on the basin scale, the concentration index showed that the daily rainfall of the Lake Urmia basin was neither in regular nor in strongly irregular conditions at any of the stations studied. All the stations studied were in fairly regular, moderate concentration and fairly irregular conditions of daily precipitation distribution. The results also showed that the moderate concentration includes most of the daily precipitation distributions throughout the basin.

J	Elbert, J; Jacques-Coper, M; Van Daele, M; Urrutia, R; Grosjean, M				Elbert, Julie; Jacques-Coper, Martin; Van Daele, Maarten; Urrutia, Roberto; Grosjean, Martin			A 600 years warm-season temperature record from varved sediments of Lago Plomo, Northern Patagonia, Chile (47°S)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												High-resolution records of calibrated proxy data for the past millennium are fundamental to place current changes into the context of pre-industrial natural forced and unforced variability. Although the need for regional spatially-explicit comprehensive reconstructions is widely recognized, the proxy data sources are still scarce, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere and especially for South America. We present a 600-year long warm season temperature record from varved sediments of Lago Plomo, a proglacial lake of the Northern Patagonian Ice field in Southern Chile (46 degrees 59'S, 72 degrees 52'W, 203 m a.s.l.). The thickness of the bright summer sediment layer relative to the dark winter layer (measured as total brightness; % reflectance 400-730 nm) is calibrated against warm season SONDJF temperature (1900 -2009; r = 0.58, p((aut)) = 0.056, RE = 0.52; CE = 0.15, RMSEP = 0.28 degrees C; five-year triangular filtered data). In Lago Plomo, warm summer temperatures lead to enhanced glacier melt and suspended sediment transport, which results in thicker light summer layers and to brighter sediments. Although Patagonia shows pronounced regional differences in decadal temperature trends and variability, the 600 years temperature reconstruction from Lago Plomo compares favourably with other regional/continental temperature records, but also emphasizes significant regional differences for which no data and information existed so far. These regional differences seem to be real as they are also reflected in modern climate data sets (1900-2010). The reconstruction shows pronounced subdecadal - multidecadal variability with cold phases during parts of the Little Ice Age (16th and 18th centuries) and in the beginning of the 20th century. The most prominent warm phase is the 19th century which is as warm as the second half of the 20th century. The exceptional summer warmth AD 1780-1810 is also found in other archives of Northern Patagonia and Central Chile. Our record shows the delayed 20th century warming in the Southern Hemisphere. The comparison between winter precipitation and summer temperature (inter-seasonal coupling) from Lago Plomo reveals alternating phases with parallel and contrasting decadal trends of winter precipitation and summer temperature (positive and negative running correlations R-winter PP; summer TT). This observation from the sediment proxy data is also confirmed by two sets of reanalysis data for the 20th century. Reanalysis data show that phases with negative correlations between winter precipitation and summer temperature (e.g., dry winters and warm summers) at Lago Plomo are characteristic for periods when circumpolar Westerly flow is displaced southward and enhanced around 60 degrees S.

Temporal and spatial variation in Hg accumulation in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): Possible influences of DOC and diet	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are filter feeders located near the base of the foodweb and these animals are able to utilize a variety of carbon sources that may also vary seasonally. We conducted both a spatial and a temporal study in order to test the hypotheses: (1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations influence Hg accumulation in zebra mussels sampled from a series of lakes and (2) seasonal variations in diet influence Hg accumulation. In the spatial study, we found a significant negative relationship between Hg concentrations and DOC concentrations, suggesting an influence of DOC on Hg bioaccumulation. In the temporal study, we used stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) as ecological tools to provide a temporally integrated description of the feeding ecology of zebra mussels. Both delta N-15 and delta C-13 varied seasonally in a similar manner: more depleted values occurred in the summer and more enriched values occurred in the fall. Mercury concentrations also varied significantly over the year, with highest concentrations occurring in the summer, followed by a progressive decrease in concentrations into the fall. The C/N ratio of zebra mussels also varied significantly over the year with the lowest values occurring mid-summer and then values increased in the fall and winter, suggesting that there was significant variation in lipid stores. These results indicate that in addition to any effect of seasonal dietary changes, seasonal variation in energy stores also appeared to be related to Hg levels in the zebra mussels. Collectively results from this study suggest that DOC concentrations, seasonal variation in diet and seasonal depletion of energy stores are all important variables to consider when understanding Hg accumulation in zebra mussels.

In this study, wireless sensors and automatic water sample collection systems were used to carry out continuous high-frequency monitoring of cyanobacteria and related environmental indicators in Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu, during a northwest wind event in spring. The results showed that there were many dormant cyanobacteria seeds in the sediments of Lake Taihu. These cyanobacterial seeds were easily resuspended from sediments, allowing them to reinvade and remain in the overlying water. Simultaneously, the water temperature exceeded the recovery temperature after the northwest wind event and the available light was sufficient to allow the reinvading cyanobacteria to recruit. The circadian photosynthetic rhythm of these recruited cyanobacteria eventually led to a rapid increase in dissolved oxygen in the water body during the south wind phase to a supersaturated state, and periodic diurnal fluctuations of the water body dissolved oxygen saturation curve. This study provided direct evidence for fully understanding the annual cycle of cyanobacterial blooms.

A coupled isotope tracer method to characterize input water to lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We develop a new coupled isotope tracer method for characterizing the isotopic composition of input water to takes, and apply it in the context of ongoing hydrological process studies in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, a large, remote, riparian ecosystem in the boreal region of western Canada. The region has a highly seasonal climate, with floodplain takes typically receiving input only during the 4-6 month open-water season from varying proportions of spring snowmelt, summer rains and river flooding. These possible input sources have distinct ranges of isotopic compositions that are strongly constrained to a well-defined local meteoric water line, thus affording the opportunity to derive take-specific estimates of the integrated isotopic composition of input waters after accounting for the effects of secondary evaporative isotopic enrichment. As shown by comparison of the results of isotopic surveys of delta takes prior to freeze-up in 2000 and 2005, this isotopic characterization of input waters can be combined with other data and field observations to provide new insight into spatial and temporal variability in delta take recharge processes. This includes evidence that summer rainfall in 2000 played an important role in replenishing shallow basins delta-wide, especially in the central low-lying region, compensating for below-average snow accumulation during the previous winter. In contrast, 2005 was marked by greater relative contributions from both snowmelt and river flooding because of high winter snow accumulation and a spring ice-jam that caused river floodwaters to enter some basins in the southern part of the delta. The method is readily transferable to investigations in other remote regions that are sparsely monitored by conventional hydrometric networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonality can affect ecological interactions between fishes of different thermal guilds	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Seasonality could play a crucial role in structuring species interactions. For example, many ectotherms alter their activity, habitat, and diet in response to seasonal temperature variation. Species also vary widely in physiological traits, like thermal preference, which may mediate their response to seasonal variation. How behavioral responses to seasonality differ between competing species and alter their overlap along multiple niche axes in space and time, remains understudied. Here, we used bulk carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes combined with stomach content analysis to determine the seasonal diet overlap between a native cold-water species [lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush)] and a range-expanding warm-water species [smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu)] in two north-temperate lakes over 2 years. We coupled these analyses with fine-scale acoustic telemetry from one of the lakes to determine seasonal overlap in habitat use and activity levels. We found that dietary niche overlap was higher in the spring, when both species were active and using more littoral resources, compared to the summer, when the cold-water lake trout increased their reliance on pelagic resources. Telemetry data revealed that activity rates diverged in the winter, when lake trout remained active, but the warm-water smallmouth bass reduced their activity. Combining stable isotopes and stomach contents with acoustic telemetry was a powerful approach for demonstrating that species interactions are temporally and spatially dynamic. In our case, the study species diverged in their diet, habitat, and activity more strongly during certain times of the year than others, in ways that were consistent with their thermal preferences. Despite large differences in thermal preference, however, there were times of year when both species were active and sharing a common habitat and prey source (i.e., resource overlap was greater in spring than summer). Based on our findings, important ecological processes are occurring during all seasons, which would be missed by summer sampling alone. Our study stresses that quantifying multiple niche axes in both space and time is important for understanding the possible outcomes of altered seasonal conditions, including shorter winters, already arising under a changing climate.																			2296-701X					OCT 6	2022	10								986459	10.3389/fevo.2022.986459	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.986459													WOS:000873739300001

However, increasing observational evidence has suggested prolonged Microcystis blooms, extending into winter worldwide. The underlying mechanisms, including those associated with global warming and eutrophication, remain unclear. In this study, we examined the integrated effects of eutrophication and temperatures on the survival, regrowth, and buoyancy of Microcystis colonies in environments where temperatures were low (4, 8, 12, and 8 +/- 4 degrees C, representing the overwintering phase) and increased to a constant 25 degrees C (representing the recovery phase). Our results uncovered that eutrophication exacerbates the stimulating impact of warm winter temperatures on the survival and growth of overwintering Microcystis. Low nutrients (TN:1.21 mg L-1, TP:0.064 mg L-1) suppress the survival and growth of Microcystis during overwintering and recovery phases, even when the winter temperature increases to 12 degrees C. In contrast, Microcystis gradually grew at 4 degrees C under a high nutrient treatment (TN:14.63 mg L-1, TP:0.987 mg L-1). Chlorophyll fluorescence suggested such responses were likely caused by elevated nutrients, which significantly improved Microcystis' photoprotection, limiting photodamage under low temperature and light conditions. Furthermore, nutrient enrichment enabled buoyancy recovery, allowing Microcystis to float upward during the recovery phase. These findings suggest a reduced bottleneck threshold of temperature triggering winter Microcystis blooms at higher nutrient levels, underscoring the importance of nutrient control in managing cyanobacterial blooms and lake ecosystems under climatically dynamic conditions.

Change in dust seasonality as the primary driver for orbital-scale dust storm variability in East Asia	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Glacial periods are recognized to be dustier than interglacials, but the conditions leading to greater dust mobilization are poorly defined. Here we present a new high-resolution dust record based on Th-230-normalized He-4 flux from Ocean Drilling Program site 882 in the Subarctic North Pacific covering the last 170,000years. By analogy with modern relationships, we infer the mechanisms controlling orbital-scale dust storm variability in East Asia. We propose that orbital-scale dust flux variability is the result of an expansion of the dust season into summer, in addition to more intense dust storms during spring and fall. The primary drivers influencing dust flux include summer insolation at subarctic latitudes and variable Siberian alpine glaciation, which together control the cold air reservoir in Siberia. Changes in the extent of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets may be a secondary control.					; Jaccard, Samuel/G-3447-2014; Jaccard, Samuel/IZP-9669-2023	Anderson, Robert/0000-0002-8472-2494; Jaccard, Samuel/0000-0002-5793-0896; Kienast, Stephanie/0000-0003-3867-4919; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 28	2017	44	8					3796	3805		10.1002/2016GL072345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL072345													WOS:000401847500042

In this paper, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was applied to analyze the temporal variability and spatial distribution characteristics of meteorological drought over the Poyang Lake Basin during 1961-2015. In addition, correlation analysis was used to investigate the response relationship between lake level and meteorological drought in the basin. The main results showed that: (1) The decline of water level in Poyang Lake since 2000 has been dramatic, especially in autumn, when the downward speed reached 11.26 cm/day. (2) The meteorological drought in the Poyang Lake Basin has obvious seasonal characteristics, and drying tendencies in spring and autumn were relatively obvious. Following the 1960s, this basin entered a new drought period in the 2000s. (3) The results of correlation analysis showed that three-and six-month timescales were the optimum times for the lake level to respond to the SPEI in the Poyang Lake Basin. Seasonally, the correlation was best in winter and worst in autumn. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of correlations was: Hukou < Xingzi < Duchang < Wucheng < Tangyin < Kangshan. Overall, the results of this study quantified the response of lake level to meteorological drought in the context of climate change, and they provide a reliable scientific basis for water resource management in similar basins.

J	Qiao, X; Tang, Y; Jaffe, D; Chen, P; Xiao, WY; Deng, GP				Qiao Xue; Tang Ya; Jaffe, Daniel; Chen Pan; Xiao Weiyang; Deng Guiping			Surface ozone in Jiuzhaigou National Park, eastern rim of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Located in southwestern China, Jiuzhaigou National Park is one of the most popular tourism destinations in China, famous for its unique aquatic ecosystems and beautiful forests. However, plants in the park may be at high ozone risk as a result of the intensive use of diesel tour buses in the park. In addition, Jiuzhaigou is close to a region with relatively high regional anthropogenic NOx emissions. During the growing season, also the peak season of tourism, we measured ozone concentration at two sites within the Park and these were: Jiuzhaigou Bureau (JB) and Long Lake (LL). The results indicate that ozone concentrations were not high enough to cause foliar injury during the monitoring period, although the risk of ozone to plants was higher in spring than in summer and autumn. Diurnal ozone cycles at JB and LL displayed significantly higher ozone concentrations in the daytime than in the nighttime, suggesting photochemical production of ozone during the day and ozone deposition during the night as a result of the nocturnal boundary layer. In parallel with the seasonal change of background surface ozone in the Northern Hemisphere, maximum daily 8-h average ozone concentration (MDA8) and daily ozone concentration decreased from spring to autumn at the two sites. This temporal variation in Jiuzhaigou was most likely associated with the downward mixing of ozone-rich air from the free troposphere, because all the high-ozone events (MDA8 > 70.0 ppb) were observed in spring and ozone-rich air from the free troposphere was the dominant cause. In summary, our data suggest that ozone concentrations in Jiuzhaigou were more affected by the regional-scale of background pattern in air quality and meteorological conditions than by local tourist activities.					; Qiao, Xue/AAH-3453-2019; Xiao, Wei/G-6586-2012	Qiao, Xue/0000-0001-7412-5090; 													1672-6316	1993-0321				OCT	2012	9	5					687	696		10.1007/s11629-012-2449-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-012-2449-8													WOS:000309183900009

Daily consumption rates were referred to the stock of the different age classes of fish. Seven food compartments (phytoplankton, macrophytes, Cladocera, Copepoda, macroinvertebrates, fish and sediment) were used by the fish. The main prey compartment of R. rutilus were macroinvertebrates (39.7%), sediment (29.0%), macrophytes (15.4%) and phytoplankton (14.9%). Little zooplankton was consumed (2.4%). P Fluviatilis fed mainly on macroinvertebrates and fish fry (both 41.8%) and some zooplankton (15.0%). For G. cernuus, macroinvertebrates dominated in the diet (97.4%). During spring, Bacillariophyceae and macroinvertebrates represented the principal preys. During summer, insect larvae, phytoplankton and macrophytes were the principal components of the diet. At the end of summer, macrofauna was scare and fish tended to move to the pelagic zone feeding on plankton. In autumn, the prey spectrum was large. During winter, sediment was the most important item consumed, together with some macroinvertebrates. The impact of this fish community through consumption is highest on macroinvertebrates (40.7%), flora (27.7%) and sediment (28.4%). The predation of these three fish on zooplankton was low (1% per day of the zooplankton biomass) and restricted to periods when the other items were scarce. Interspecific competition is not excluded for macroinvertebrates.

The total PCB and PBDE concentrations ranged from not detected to 107.1 ng g(-1) dw and from 9.7 to 151.3 ng g(-1) dw, respectively. PCB-28, 101 and 180 were dominant congeners in both winter and summer. BDE-28 (44 %) was the dominant congener in winter and summer, followed by BDE-99 (28 %) and BDE-47 (26 %). The concentrations of PCBs in the sediment samples collected in summer were higher than those in winter, while the concentrations of PBDEs did not show much seasonal variations. Source analysis showed that the PCBs probably originated from urban runoff, industrial pollution and atmospheric deposition, and the PBDEs probably originated from historical usage of penta-BDE mixtures. Potential eco-toxicological risks caused by PCBs were found in about 5 % of the sampling sites; PBDEs had moderate eco-toxicological risk in 80 % sampling sites in the East Lake, China.

Influence of repeated fertilization on forest ecosystems: relative habitat use by mule deer and moose	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												This study was designed to test the hypothesis that large-scale precommercial thinning (PCT) and repeated fertilization of young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) stands would enhance relative habitat use by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus Rafinesque) and moose (Alces alces L.) in summer and winter periods, compared to that in mature and old-growth stands. Replicate study areas were located near Summerland, Kelowna, and Williams Lake in south central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had a range of PCT densities, with and without fertilization, and mature and old-growth stands. Habitat use in summer and winter was measured by pellet-group counts of deer and moose from 1999 to 2003, 6-10 years after the onset of treatments. During summer months, habitat use by deer was enhanced by PCT with fertilization, and the 1000 stems/ha fertilized stands experienced greater use than the unthinned or mature stands. Winter habitat use by deer was similar in the 1000 stems/ha fertilized stands and old-growth stands. In both summer and winter, moose preferred fertilized to unfertilized stands and low-density to high-density stands. Intensive management of young lodgepole pine forests has considerable potential to develop summer and winter ranges for these ungulates.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				JUN	2006	36	6					1395	1406		10.1139/X06-033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X06-033													WOS:000238286600005

This condition is considered to be a result of the progression of global warming. A bloom of large diatoms was observed in the ice-free area between February and April. This early spring bloom seemed to have started in the latter part of January, and lasted for about three months. The maximum chlorophyll-a (Chl a) concentration of about to mg m(-3) was observed in March, and was similar to the level of 5-20 mg m(-3) previously reported for the ordinary spring bloom in Saroma-ko Lagoon. The maximum primary production of 786 mgC m(-2) day(-1) and the maximum Chl a-specific primary production, an index of the phytoplankton growth rate, were also found in March. Species changes from Thalassiosira spp. to Chaetoceros spp. were observed during the bloom. This early spring bloom could extend into the ordinary spring bloom period. Its duration was obviously longer than that of the spring bloom, which is typically about one month. These results show the phytoplankton condition that could be expected during winter and spring as global warming progresses.																			0025-3154	1469-7769				FEB	2012	92	1					29	37		10.1017/S0025315411000361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315411000361													WOS:000299655400003

NEMATODE POPULATIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON SUCCEEDING CROP YIELDS	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												The high cost of nitrogenous fertilizer and the withdrawal of many effective nematicides from the marketplace created needs that might be partially satisfied by growing nematode-resistant legumes. Legumes resistant to prevalent nematode species could furnish N for and suppress nematode populations in succeeding crops if green manured and incorporated into the soil. The effects of tropical legumes, grown as summer green manure crops, on populations of four plant-parasitic nematodes were compared with fallow and ''Cracker Jack'' marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) in fumigated (with 1,2-dibromoethane) and nonfumigated plots in 1979, 1980, and 1981 on an Arrendondo fine sand (loamy, siliceous, hyperthermic, Grossarenic Paleudult). Long-term effects of summer legume green-manuring on nematode populations and yield of succeeding crops was determined using several cereals and legumes grown in the succeeding fall, winter, and spring seasons. One cultivar, ''Norman'', and one line, ''F1 81d'', of pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.], showy crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis Roth.), hairy indigo (Indigofera hirsuta L.), jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana L.), velvetbean [Mucuna deeringiana (Bort.) Merr.], and marigold reduced soil populations of rootknot nematodes [Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood] in each year planted; ''PI 305070'' mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilcz.] did not. Fumigation, fallowing, and rotation with jointvetch, hairy indigo, and crotalaria reduced sting nematode (Belonolaimus longicaudatus Rau.) populations. Rotation with hairy indigo or marigold consistently reduced the lesion nematodes [Pratylenchus brachyurus (Godfrey) Goodey] in all the succeeding crops. Fumigation generally reduced ring nematode (Criconemoides spp.) populations. Root-knot nematode and the incorporated green manure had the greatest influence on snap bean [Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv, ''Blue Lake Bunch''] dry matter yield.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				JAN-FEB	1986	78	1					5	10		10.2134/agronj1986.00021962007800010002x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1986.00021962007800010002x													WOS:A1986AYX0100002
J	Pelechaty, M; Brzozowski, M; Pietruczuk, K				Pelechaty, Mariusz; Brzozowski, Michal; Pietruczuk, Karol			Overwintering and gyrogonite formation by the rare and endangered indicative macroalga Lychnothamnus barbatus (Meyen) Leonh. in eutrophic conditions	AQUATIC BOTANY												Lychnothamnus barbatus (Meyen) Leonhardi is a rare, endangered charophyte species considered to be a reliable indicator of low water fertility, with its fossilized gyrogonites (calcified oospores) being applied as a biomarker of past oligotrophic conditions. This paper presents a case study from a lake in which L barbatus occurs abundantly under eutrophic conditions (Lake Kuznickie, central-western Poland). The species overwinters in this lake in the form of extensive meadows along a wide depth gradient and, in addition, produces fully developed gyrogonites. The occurrence of L. barbatus in Lake Kuznickie was investigated at 1 m depth intervals at nine permanent transects in November 2015 and in April 2016. Spring thalli were observed microscopically to determine whether L. barbatus overwintered (with new outgrowths on old thalli) or grew anew in spring (from oospores). The species occurred at almost 50% of the surveyed sites in both sampling periods. At most sites L barbatus formed compact carpets in which it was the only species or co-occurred with the charophyte Nitellopsis obtusa or the angiosperm Ceratophyllum demersum. L. barbatus occurred along a wide depth gradient: 1.5-6.5 m deep in autumn and 2-6.5 m after the winter period. The species coverages in April 2016 were comparable to those observed in November 2015 (Mann-Whitney U-test, P>0.05). The thalli collected in April were well preserved after the winter, with numerous spring outgrowths. In addition, fully developed gyrogonites were found in April 2016. This study indicates wider fertility tolerance of L. barbatus and its ability to overwinter under eutrophic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Laugaste, R; Jastremskij, VV; Ott, I				Laugaste, R; Jastremskij, VV; Ott, I			Phytoplankton of Lake Peipsi-Pihkva: Species composition, biomass and seasonal dynamics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												With 33 years of phytoplankton quantitative studies carried out, a series of qualitative data with a length of over 80 years is at our disposal. About 500 algal species have been found in plankton by different researchers. In different seasons and years 35 main species (dominants and subdominants) form 68-96 % of biomass in L. Pihkva (southern, more eutrophic part) and 60-97 % in L. Peipsi (northern, less eutrophic part). L. Lammijarv, connecting the two parts is similar to L. Pihkva in respect to phytoplankton and the trophic state. Diatoms and blue-green algae prevail in biomass, diatoms and green algae, in the species number. The oligo-mesotrophic Aulacoseira islandica (O. Muller) Sim. is characteristic of the cool period; A. granulata (Ehr.) Sim. and Stephanodiscus binderanus (Kutz.) Krieger prevail in summer and autumn, the latter being most abundant in the southern part. Gloeotrichia echinulata (J.S. Smith) P. Richter and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (L.) Ralfs dominate in summer causing water-bloom. Phytoplankton has mostly three maxima in seasonal dynamics in L. Peipsi and two in L. Pihkva. Its average biomass in spring in different years has fluctuated in the range 5.6-16 and 6-12.7 g m(-3), in summer 3.1-14.8 and 5.6-125 (10-20 in most cases); and in autumn 7-16.3 and 5.2-26 in the northern and southern parts, respectively. The dominant complex has not changed considerably since 1909; however, the distribution of dominant species in lake parts has become more even in the last decades. Periods of high biomass occurred in the first half of the 1960s and 1970s and in 1988-1994, of low biomass in 1981-1987. The first coincided, in general, with periods of low water level and high water temperature.

J	Pickard, DP; Benke, AC				Pickard, DP; Benke, AC			Production dynamics of Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda) among different habitats in a small wetland in the southeastern USA	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The life history, population dynamics, and secondary production of Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda) were studied in a small southeastern wetland pond. Habitat-specific sampling was used to estimate density, biomass, and production in each of 3 habitats (benthic, Nymphaea odorata leaves, and submerged wood). Laboratory experiments at different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) provided predictive equations for estimating growth rate and egg development times that could be applied to field populations. Size-frequency data from field sampling suggested that H. azteca had 2 major cohorts per year, but reproduction was continuous from spring through fall. Mean annual density and biomass were 904/ m(2) and 85 mg dry mass (DM)/m(2). Daily growth rate was a function of both individual mass and temperature. Annual production of somatic tissues as estimated by the instantaneous growth method (675 mg DM . m(-2). y(-1)) agreed well with that using the size-frequency method (714 mg DM . m(-2). y(-1)). Egg production (252 mg DM . m(-2). y(-1)) represented 27% of total production (927 mg DM . m(-2). y(-1)). Annual production:biomass (P/B) was 7.8 without eggs and 9.8 with eggs. Habitat-specific estimates of density, biomass, and production were highest in the benthic habitat. The contribution of somatic production from Nymphaea leaves to total amphipod production was low (6.2%), but temporal patterns of production followed trends in leaf abundance. Production on leaves reached 29% in September when leaves were most abundant. Contributions of animals from submerged wood were consistently low (2.9%). Monthly densities and production peaked in May at the start of the summer cohort, decreased throughout summer, and showed a small increase in October at the start of the winter cohort. Although egg production and birth rates were highest in summer months, high death rates were responsible for the late-summer declines in density and production. These temporal trends in production suggest heavy predation or environmental stress, or both, during summer months.																			0887-3593					DEC	1996	15	4					537	550		10.2307/1467805	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467805													WOS:A1996WC65800012

A Lagrangian approach was used as the sampling method in order to discriminate various sources along the River. Four transects were sampled in spring, summer and autumn. In addition, more intensive sampling was carried out at two of the four transects between March and November 1991 in order to study the seasonal pattern of chlorophenol transport. Only 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol were detected in almost ali samples. Average concentrations were similar in the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries at 16 ng/g for tetrachlorophenol and 46 ng/g for pentachlorophenol. Concentrations and fluxes were highest in autumn for both compounds ostensibly due to their use as wood preservatives. Fluxes tended to increase from Cornwall to Quebec city and reflected a seasonal trend. The relative importance of the major sources of chlorophenols in this river system was calculated using a simple mass balance model. The Great Lakes and Quebec tributaries account for 25 % and 30 % respectively, industries were a negligible source and diffuse sources were found to be the greatest at ca. 44 %.

In this paper, we analyze temperature data from 13 temperature logger chains and from over 130 benthic acoustic receivers that were deployed across Lake Ontario for 2 yr. The timing and duration of the fall overturn correlate with the local average water depth, and shallow sites (< 50 m depth) overturn up to a month before deep sites (> 100 m depths). Likewise, in spring, the shallow sites warm faster. Lake Ontario has partial ice cover, so wind-driven mixing stirs the water column throughout winter, and inverse thermal stratification is largely absent. The depth-averaged winter water temperatures vary between 0 degrees C and 4 degrees C, with the coldest temperatures (near 0.1 degrees C) found in the shallow Kingston basin and warmest temperatures (near 4 degrees C) at sites near the 244 m deep Rochester Basin. Lake Ontario appears to be a warm monomictic lake, rather than having a dimictic mixing pattern as previously described-there is no sustained ice cover or inverse stratification that inhibits vertical mixing in winter. Winter is a poorly understood season for many aquatic processes, including fish bioenergetics, fish distribution, biochemical processes, invertebrate distribution, and production. Moreover, the lack of knowledge of winter has hampered the use of correct initial conditions for running large lake hydrodynamic models.

Effects of freshwater release on oyster reef density, reproduction, and disease in a highly modified estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Few estuaries remain unaffected by water management and altered freshwater deliveries. The Caloosahatchee River Estuary is a perfect case study for assessing the impact of altered hydrology on natural oyster reef (Crassostrea virginica) populations. The watershed has been highly modified and greatly enlarged by an artificial connection to Lake Okeechobee. Accordingly, to generate data to support water management recommendations, this study monitored various oyster biometrics over 15 years along the primary salinity gradient. Oyster reef densities were significantly affected by both prolonged high volume freshwater releases creating hyposaline conditions at upstream sites and by a lack of freshwater input creating hypersaline conditions at downstream sites. Low freshwater input led to an increase in disease caused by Perkinsus marinus and predation. Moderate (< 2000 cfs) and properly timed (winter/spring) freshets benefited oysters with increased gametogenesis, good larval mixing, and a reprieve from disease. If high volume freshets occurred in the late summer, extensive mortality occurred at the upstream site due to low salinity. These findings suggest freshwater releases in the late summer, when reproductive stress is at its peak and pelagic larvae are most vulnerable, should be limited to < 2000 cfs, but that longer freshets (1-3 weeks) in the winter and early spring (e.g., December-April) benefit oysters by reducing salinity and lessening disease intensity. Similar strategies can be employed in other managed systems, and patterns regarding the timing of high volume flows are applicable to all estuaries where the management of healthy oyster reefs is a priority.					; Rumbold, Darren/A-7117-2009	Rumbold, Darren/0000-0003-2761-3635; McFarland, Katherine/0000-0002-3355-7839; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2022	194	2							96	10.1007/s10661-021-09489-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09489-x								35029759					WOS:000742663400002
J	Li, HY; Minor, EC				Li, Hongyu; Minor, Elizabeth C.			Biogeochemical characteristics of settling particulate organic matter in Lake Superior: A seasonal comparison	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												To assess settling particulate organic matter (POM) seasonality and its availability to the benthic community, settling particulate matter was studied in terms of mass fluxes and main biogeochemical characteristics (including organic carbon (OC), nitrogen, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic values) at two Lake Superior offshore sites over the course of a year. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and hydrolysis, extraction, and derivatization were used to provide further compositional information. Carbon and nitrogen content, isotopic and wet chemical data, and FTIR spectra show that summer particulate material is mainly autochthonous, with higher proportions of amide and carbohydrate. FTIR shows that spring particulate material contains relatively high proportions of clay minerals, indicating major sources from sediment resuspension and/or spring runoff. Distinct amino acid distributions at the two sites, revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) based on amino acid mol% composition, possibly result from differences in OM sources and the degree of degradation occurring at the two sites. Carbohydrate (PCHO), total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA) and FTIR data suggest that the nutritional value of bulk POM to benthic heterotrophs should be lower in spring than summer-fall, although both periods exhibited high sinking fluxes of total mass and OC. Due to sediment resuspension events and an oxic water column, organic matter eventually buried in Lake Superior's sediments has probably experienced extensive alteration due to several cycles through the water column and the bacterially-active sediment-water interface.

Concentrations of Hg in water, particulate matter, plankton and macrophytes at various stations in the coastal zone (a bay with restricted water exchange, near an industrial city, river mouths, and the open sea) were measured in 2006-2008. Hg concentrations observed in the Southern Baltic varied greatly, showing the highest average values in all environmental compartments near the river mouths. In shallow, sheltered parts of the gulf, where water exchange is restricted, Hg concentrations in the water and in macrophytes were elevated relative to those in the coastal zone of the deeper part of the bay and in the open Baltic. Distance to the river mouth, terrestrial runoff, and quantity and quality of organic matter were more important than seasonal variations in controlling Hg and Hg-SPM concentrations in water samples. Mercury concentrations in the surface microlayer at the air/sea interface were over 10 times higher than those in the bulk surface water. Concentrations of Hg in macrophytes in the winter were significantly higher than those in the warm seasons (spring, summer, autumn). This was probably the combined effect of higher availability of Hg in porewaters and leaf growth inhibition.

A clear size effect was observed in river-resident individuals, with significantly higher 137Cs concentrations in autumn, particularly in 1-year-old (age-1) prespawning adults. River residents (mean 1990 Bq/kg) showed significantly higher 137Cs concentrations than the larger lake migrants (mean 703 Bq/kg). The main prey items of river residents were terrestrial and aquatic insects, whereas lake migrants predominantly consumed small fish (pond smelt), as indicated by distinct d13C and d15N values. Larger age-1 river residents consumed a greater proportion of terrestrial prey than smaller age-0 individuals. A significant linear relationship between 137Cs concentrations in diets and those in age-1 river residents was observed in autumn, when terrestrial insects had higher 137Cs concentrations than aquatic insects. These results suggest that larger river residents efficiently fed on terrestrial insects with elevated 137Cs concentrations, resulting in rapid 137Cs accumulation during summer-autumn. By contrast, the lower variation in lake migrants likely reflects their consistent feeding on small fish with lower 137Cs concentrations. Potential factors contributing to interspecific differences in 137Cs concentrations and their variability among masu salmon and other river and lake fish are also discussed.

Hydrothermal and Cold Spring Water and Primary Productivity Effects on Magnesium Isotopes: Lake Myvatn, Iceland	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Lake Myvatn, Iceland, is one of the most biologically productive lakes in the northern hemisphere, despite seasonal ice cover. Hydrothermal and groundwater springs make up the dominant source to this lake, and we investigate their Mg isotope ratio to assess the effect of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal springs, which are the primary modern sink of seawater magnesium. We also examine a time series in the only outflow from this lake, the Laxa River, to assess the effects of seasonal primary productivity on Mg isotopes. In the hydrothermal waters, there is a clear distinction between cold waters (largely unfractionated from primary basalt) and relatively hot waters, which exhibit over 1 parts per thousand fractionation, with consequences for the oceanic mass balance if the hydrothermal removal of Mg is not fully quantitative. The outflow Mg isotopes are similar to basalts (delta Mg-26 = -0.2 to -0.3) during winter but reach a peak of similar to 0 parts per thousand in August. This fractionation corresponds to calcite precipitation during summer in Lake Myvatn, preferentially taking up light Mg isotopes and driving the residual waters isotopically heavy as observed, meaning that overall the lake is a CO2 sink.					; Murphy, Melissa/C-8375-2013; Opfergelt, Sophie/L-2107-2015; von Strandmann, Philip/A-8638-2008	Murphy, Melissa/0000-0002-0921-1467; 														2296-6463				APR 30	2020	8								109	10.3389/feart.2020.00109	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00109													WOS:000535541200001

Recent detections of RSC populations in several locations in Michigan, USA spurred action to develop trap-based early detection and response plans based on the best available science, however, few recommendations are available concerning important sampling logistics such as timing and density of deployed traps. We surveyed 231 waterbodies (mainly lentic systems with relatively few small lotic systems) for RSC in two invasion zones in southern Michigan. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to evaluate baited traps for detection of RSC invasions, and qualitatively evaluated feasibility of eDNA metabarcoding for enhancing trap-based detection strategies. While overall occupancy was low, predicted detection probabilities with baited traps ranged from 27 to 98% and depended on season, density of traps, and relative crayfish abundance. There was high agreement between trapping and eDNA detections (94%). However, an improved eDNA sampling design that increases the number of samples is needed. We conclude that trap-based detections of RSC in Michigan are most likely to occur mid-summer, trapping densities should be increased in the spring and fall to offset lower detection probabilities, and eDNA could feasibly supplement trapping in spring and fall.					; Budnick, William/ABI-7625-2020	Kanefsky, Jeannette/0000-0002-6038-3651; Hayes, Daniel/0000-0002-8132-4749; Sard, Nicholas/0000-0001-7695-2946; Thomas, Sara/0000-0003-2280-5363; Budnick, William/0000-0001-9288-6782													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2024	851	11					2761	2774		10.1007/s10750-024-05492-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05492-8		FEB 2024											WOS:001173245300002

We examine two sediment cores derived from lakes located to the south and north of the Ilan Plain in northeastern Taiwan. Seasonal and typhoon rainfall data over the past several decades are collected for this study region. We also use mineral indicators, K/Rb ratios and grain size to estimate sediment sources, intensity of chemical weathering and rainfall intensity. The results show that the chemical weathering index (K/Rb ratio) of Meihua Lake indicates the continuing effects of autumn rainfall, while coarse grain sizes of Dahu Lake sediments suggest increased intensity in typhoon rainfall. Grain size results reveal that increasing El NinoSouthern Oscillation intensity in the tropical Pacific has intensified the activity of super typhoons in the western North Pacific. Finally, we find that frequent activity of super paleo-typhoons occurred in Taiwan during the La Nina-like state, and the strengthening winter monsoon activity and higher sea surface temperature enhanced plentiful autumn rainfall in El Nino-like state. After comparing our results with the paleo-typhoon data in Japan and south China, we suggest that the tracks of super typhoon are mainly affected by variations in the warm pool and subtropical Northwestern Pacific High in the western Pacific.

J	Redwan, M; Elhaddad, E				Redwan, Mostafa; Elhaddad, Engy			Heavy metals seasonal variability and distribution in Lake Qaroun sediments, El-Fayoum, Egypt	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This study was carried out to investigate the seasonal variability and distribution of heavy metals "HMs" (Fe, Mn, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and V) in the bottom sediments of Lake Qaroun, in Egypt. The samples were collected from 10 sites in summer and winter seasons in 2015. Total metals concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma spectrometer. Multivariate techniques were applied to analyse the distribution and potential source of heavy metals. The mean seasonal concentrations follow a descending order of Fe > Mn > V > Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Co > Pb. The mean concentrations of HMs in sediments during summer were higher than the concentrations during winter and above the average world shale values, except for Pb, suggesting potential adverse toxicity to aquatic organisms. All metals showed enrichment during summer and winter at sites S3 and S5 in the southeastern parts of the lake due to the heavy discharge of contaminants from El-Bats and El-Wadi drains. Principal component analysis results suggested two principal components controlling HMs variability in sediments, which accounted for 63.9% (factor 1: Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb and V), 15.9% (factor 2: Mn and Fe) during summer, and 76.7% (factor 1: Fe, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb and V), 13.8% (factor 2: Mn) during winter of the total variance. Geo-accumulation index (I-geo) showed some pollution risk at the southeastern and southern parts (sites S3 and S5). Dilution during winter, concentration during summer, impact of non-point sources from different agricultural, industrial, municipal sewage and fish farms in the southern part of Lake Qaroun, adsorption and salt dissolution reactions and lithogenic sources are the main controlling factors for HMs in the study area. Monitoring of contaminant discharge at Lake Qaroun should be introduced for future remediation and management strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, spatio-temporal variations of macroinvertebrate community and their influential variables in a typical large macrophyte-dominated shallow lake-Baiyangdian Lake were studied, using three-year in-situ observational data of spring, summer, and autumn. In total, ten environmental variables and five biological indices were measured for the six sites from each of the two habitat types, semi-natural habitat and disturbed habitat divided by their different exposures to human activities. Disturbed habitat had deeper mean water depth, lower mean transparency, and higher mean concentrations of DO, TN, NH4-N, NO3-N, and COD than that of semi-natural habitat regardless of seasons. Biological metrics indicate lower family-level richness but higher community tolerance level in disturbed habitat in spring and summer, but the results were close in autumn. The present of Lestidae and Gammaridae was a significant determination of semi-natural habitat. Redundancy analyses showed community temporal distribution was mainly driven by temperature, water depth, and pH that greatly influenced by natural forces, while spatial distribution was mainly driven by TN and transparency that greatly influenced by human activity. Regarding averaged data over the same year, season, and habitat, richness and Shannon-Weiner index had significant Pearson linear correlation with transparency (r = 0.521 and r = 0.541, p < 0.05, respectively), family biotic index significantly correlated with TP (r = 0.495, p < 0.05), and NO3-N (r = 0.592, p < 0.01), and percentage of tolerant individuals significantly correlated with pH (r = 0.667, p < 0.01), temperature (r = - 0.640, p < 0.01) and NO3-N (r = 0.522, p < 0.05). Those variables are likely responsible for the major variations of community characteristics. High concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients probably encourage the thriving of tolerate assemblage in the lake. Our results reveal that the macroinvertebrate community can shift to be more monotonous and pollution-tolerant under the stress of eutrophication and organic pollution. Disturbance and pollution, in general, can diminish the benefit of habitat-scale protection in certain location.					; Yang, Yufeng/ABS-0346-2022; Zhou, Yang/HJA-9545-2022; Yang, Zhifeng/AFL-3211-2022	Zhang, Shanghong/0000-0003-1131-2002; Yi, Yujun/0000-0002-5264-4321; Zhou, Yang/0000-0002-2202-2388; Wang, Xuan/0000-0002-2857-4298; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2020	110								105948	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105948	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105948													WOS:000507381800095
J	Enz, CA; Bürgi, HR; Stössel, F; Müller, R				Enz, CA; Bürgi, HR; Stössel, F; Müller, R			Food preference of adult whitefish in eutrophic Lake Hallwil (Switzerland), and the question of cannibalism	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The aim of this study was to investigate the role of food uptake and preference of adult Lake Hallwil whitefish (Coregonus suidteri FATIO) on year class strength, with special emphasis on the situation in late winter and spring, the time when whitefish larvae hatch and may be vulnerable to cannibalism and food competition. Whitefish is the dominant and commercially most important fish species in eutrophic Lake Hallwil. Yield started to increase in 1977 thanks to stocking with prefed larvae since 1970, but has not been stable due to strong fluctuations in year class strength (YCS). Because food is one of several key parameters influencing population dynamics, food preference of adult whitefish was studied. In spring, 20-35 percent of the whitefish exclusively preyed on lake bottom fauna when zooplankton density was low due to low water temperature. 50-65 percent of the stomachs contained zooplankton exclusively during spring. In summer and fall, only I percent of the stomachs contained exclusively benthic prey while 80 percent of the whitefish preyed exclusively on zooplankton. The percentage of whitefish eating both planktonic and benthic organisms was about 15-20 percent over the whole year. Artificial hypolimnetic oxygenation since 1985 has substantially increased living space of benthic organisms. This has resulted in an improved benthic food base for Lake Hallwil whitefish. In spring, as soon as the zooplankton density had risen, whitefish switched from benthic prey to planktonic crustaceans. The question of potential food competition between adult whitefish and larvae was studied by comparing our data on feeding habits and feeding depth of adults with the respective data for larvae from the literature. Cannibalism of adult whitefish on larvae was suspected to influence population dynamics of Lake Hallwil whitefish, but no larvae were found in the stomachs studied. We conclude that the different feeding depth and food preference of whitefish larvae and adults in spring make intraspecific competition and cannibalism unlikely.																			0003-9136					AUG	2001	152	1					81	98																WOS:000170559300005

It is located in arid and semi-arid climate regions, and it is a region where the contribution of global aerosols of sand and dust is continuous. However, few studies have been conducted on the Central Asian aerosol optical depth. Therefore, this paper relied on the belt and road sustainable development dataset to analyze the spatial-temporal variations in the AOD in Central Asia and provide spatial-temporal characteristics of the AOD for environmental services. We analyzed the spatial and temporal variation in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Central Asia by using MODIS/AQUA C6 MYD08_M3 images from 2008 to 2017. The results showed that (1) the annual average AOD in Central Asia in the past decade varied from 0.183 to 0.232, which indicated a slow decline starting in 2014. The percentage of average annual decline was approximately 0.18%, and the regular distinct revealed the distribution characteristics of AOD. In different years, the Central Asian region exhibited the similar monthly change characteristics: from July to December, the AOD decreased, and from December to February, it increased. In different seasons, the Central Asian region exhibited the different seasonal change characteristics: the AOD value was higher in the spring and summer. The mean values in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 0.273, 0.240, 0.155, and 0.183, respectively, and the standard deviations were 0.036, 0.038, 0.025, and 0.048, respectively. (3) Based on spatial distribution characteristics, the Tarim Basin, Aral Sea region, and Ebinur Lake area were high value areas, and Kazakhstan was a low value area. The AOD of the surrounding area of the Aral Sea had increased in the last 5 years, while that of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan had decreased. The AOD of the Taklamakan area exhibited an inter-annual change. Sand dust aerosols were the largest contributors to the AOD in the Taklamakan area. The rising trend of the AOD in the Aral Sea area was clear, with an average annual increase of 0.234%, and the contribution of salt dust aerosols to the AOD increased. The average annual AOD in the Ebinur Lake area remained stable.

Earthworms and soil samples were collected during two campaigns (spring and autumn) from 25 x 25 cm and 30 cm deep sampling points. The complex arable landscape (CAL) supported higher earthworm, diversity, density and biomass than the similarly managed but homogeneous arable landscape (HAL). The spring and autumn earthworm sampling campaigns revealed very different patterns, and we conclude that autumn sampling is the most adequate for biomonitoring. On the other hand, the spring collections were significantly correlated to soil physical parameters, thus spring sampling is more suitable for studying such correlations. Significant correlations occurred almost exclusively for CAL and the soil parameters significantly relating with earthworm community were: soil moisture, nitrogen and organic carbon contents. The possible reason for it is the presence of numerous refuges for lumbricids offered by field margins, balks, woodlots and meadows in the CAL and lack of them in the HAL.

Zooplankton samples were collected from 18 stations in both summer and winter (2017), and their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contents were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry after ultrasound-assisted extraction. Results revealed that among 16 compounds that were analyzed, only 7 compounds were recognizable at both seasons. Pyrene was the most common individual compound of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, whereas acenaphthene was the least individual compound found at both seasons. Additionally, the highest content of the measured compounds in both summer and winter was 16.4-75.9 ng/g and 17.3-93.7 ng/g, respectively.

Concentration of total microcystins associates with nitrate and nitrite, and may disrupt the nitrogen cycle, in warm-monomictic lakes of the southcentral United States	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacterial blooms and the toxins they produce pose a growing threat worldwide. Mitigation of such events has primarily focused on phosphorus management and has largely neglected the role of nitrogen. Previous bloom research and proposed management strategies have primarily focused on temperate, dimictic lakes, and less on warm-monomictic systems like those at subtropical latitudes. The in-lake conditions, concentration of total microcystins, and microbial functioning of twenty warm-monomictic lakes in the southcentral United States were explored in the spring and summer of 2021. Our data revealed widespread microcystins in lakes across this region, some of which exceeded regulatory limits. Microcystins were higher in the spring compared to the summer, indicating that warm-monomictic lakes, even across a large range of precipitation, do not follow the trends of temperate dimictic lakes. Microcystins were found in surface waters and bottom waters well below the photic zone, reflecting the persistence of these toxins in the environment. Principal components analyses showed a strong association between microcystins, nitrate + nitrite, and Planktothrix relative abundance and tran-scriptional activity. Many systems exhibited stronger denitrification in the spring, perhaps contributing to the decreased toxin concentrations in the summer. Counter to most sampled lakes, one lake with the highest con-centration of total microcystins indicated nitrogen cycle disruption, including inhibited denitrification. These findings are relevant to mitigating cyanobacterial blooms and toxin production in warm-monomictic systems, and suggests a need to consider nitrogen, and not solely phosphorus, in nutrient management discussions.					; Brooks, Bryan/B-2612-2010; Klobusnik, Nathan/ITU-5348-2023; Labonte, Jessica/AHC-5426-2022; Kieley, Crista/KAL-9682-2024; Roelke, Daniel/B-5766-2008; Walker, Jordan/KVB-8997-2024	Labonte, Jessica/0000-0003-0236-7634; Brooks, Bryan/0000-0002-6277-9852; Stroski, Kevin/0000-0002-7607-7755; Walker, Jordan/0000-0002-9945-1017; Klobusnik, Nathan/0000-0003-0750-5397; Roelke, Daniel/0000-0002-3166-3793; Kieley, Crista/0009-0008-9939-667X													1568-9883	1878-1470				DEC	2023	130								102542	10.1016/j.hal.2023.102542	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2023.102542		NOV 2023						38061823					WOS:001121079000001
J	Alimasi, N				Alimasi, Nuerasimuguli			A review of passive microwave observations of snow-covered areas over complex Arctic terrain	BULLETIN OF GLACIOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The Arctic is experiencing rapid environmental change due to climate warming, resulting in snow condition changes. Passive microwave observation is a useful tool to monitor these changes. However, the ground conditions in boreal regions, comprised of forest, permafrost, and lakes, are complex. The rapid change of season from winter to spring is also important information obtained through snow observations when studying the Arctic climate. This study introduces previous attempts to retrieve Arctic microwave observations, examples of flight observations, and the use of the low-frequency 6GHz band to improve the assessment of snow conditions. Flight observations carried out over a forest, wetland, and lake using an airborne microwave radiometer provides detailed brightness temperature variations of the Arctic and winter - spring changes. Flight and satellite microwave observations were used to monitor warming in spring and indicated the early warming of lowlands and late warming of mountainous areas. The diurnal amplitude variation (DAV) is useful to monitor snowmelt in the Arctic. During the short winter-spring transition in the Arctic, microwave emissions showed local and temporal variations with forest, permafrost, and lake. They are available for further discussion on microwave observation of snow in the Arctic and implementation of changing Arctic cryospheric environment.																			1345-3807	1884-8044					2018	36						1	13		10.5331/bgr.18W01	http://dx.doi.org/10.5331/bgr.18W01													WOS:000435944000001

Evaluation of temperature-selection differences among juvenile muskellunge originating from different latitudes	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Genetic differences among muskellunge Esox masquinongy populations are related to residence in major river drainages, suggesting the existence of divergent stocks. By use of radio-telemetry we compared different seasonal and diel temperature selection in a southern Illinois reservoir for three geographically and genetically distinct stocks of age-2 muskellunge from throughout the latitudinal range of the species. Muskellunge from the Upper Mississippi River drainage were represented by the Leech Lake, Minnesota, population and the Ohio River drainage was represented by the Cave Run Lake, Kentucky, population. Progeny from North Spring Lake, Illinois, an interstock, or mixed-origin stock, were also evaluated. No differences in temperature selection were observed among stocks of juvenile muskellunge across seasons or diel periods. The seasonal mean temperatures of the water varied significantly-spring 21.7 degrees C, summer 28.4 degrees C, and fall 14.8 degrees C, with an overall average temperature of 24.1 degrees C, in agreement with previously published values obtained in laboratory trials. This lack of different temperature-selection patterns among stocks is in contrast with other life-history characteristics, for example growth, metabolism, and conversion efficiency, which have been shown to differ among populations and stocks.																			0378-1909					JUN	2007	79	1-2					85	98		10.1007/s10641-006-9090-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9090-8													WOS:000245869600009
J	Pulatsu, S; Topcu, A				Pulatsu, Serap; Topcu, Akasya			Seasonal and vertical distributions of porewater phosphorus and iron concentrations in a macrophyte-dominated eutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												In this study variations in total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total iron (TFe) concentrations and pH values in the littoral sediment porewater of macrophyte-dominated eutrophic Mogan Lake (Turkey), were determined depth wise (0-20 cm, on a basis of 5 cm depths) over a period of eleven months. Additionally, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, TOP SRP and TFe levels in the overlying water were measured. Especially in the spring and summer months constituting a large portion of the research period, seasonal variation of SRP at depths between 0-5 cm and 15-20 cm were not found to be statistically significant (p>0.01). However, in the fall and winter months, surface sediment (0-5 cm) SRP values were elevated in comparison with deeper sediment depths. As for TFe values, no clear seasonal variation was evident at different depths. Due to the fact that TFe concentrations in the overlying water (101.25-511.67 mg.m(-3)) were lower than iron concentrations in the porewater (104.00-783.00 mg.m(-3)), positive phosphorus release remained at low levels. In this eutrophic lake, in which action is continuing to reduce the external phosphorus load, monitoring SRP variations in the overlying water and porewater would be beneficial.

Seasonal shifts in diet composition of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis foraging at a shallow eutrophic inland lake. Ardea 99: 207-216. The diet of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis at Lake Dummer, a shallow eutrophic lake of 1240 ha in Lower Saxony (Germany) was analysed by collecting 562 regurgitated pellets over a period of one year. Pellets contained structures of 10,645 fishes belonging to 15 species. Substantial differences were found in frequency, composition and size of prey fish species. Pikeperch, Ruffe, Roach and Perch accounted for the largest seasonal differences in the diet. During late autumn and winter the diet was dominated by small-sized cyprinids and Ruffe. In spring Great Cormorants primarily foraged on larger-sized cyprinids. Young-of-the-year percids, dominated by Pikeperch, were the primary prey during summer. We estimated that at least 32.6 tons (26.3 kg/ha) of total fish biomass was removed by Cormorants, of which one third (10.8 tons) consisted of Pikeperch. 81% of the Pikeperch biomass was removed in August September, indicating that the Great Cormorant is an important predator of juvenile Pikeperch at Lake Dummer. Our findings highlight the need of extensive diet analyses in all seasons to obtain a comprehensive picture of the impact of Cormorant predation on fish stocks. Snapshots of the diet sampled over short-time periods may be misleading and inadequate for local management.																			0373-2266	2213-1175				FAL	2011	99	2					207	216		10.5253/078.099.0211	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/078.099.0211													WOS:000297377500011

Interaction between macroinvertebrate abundance and habitat use by diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Although numbers of buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) over-wintering on Lake Ontario have increased substantially over the past two decades, factors influencing habitat use and the potential for competition have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between prey availability and community structure of diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario. Benthic and nektonic samples collected during fall, winter, and spring 2002-2004 indicated that macroinvertebrate numbers differed by location but generally did not decline throughout winter. Large accumulations of macroinvertebrates, apparently moved by wave action and currents, were documented in nearshore areas. Surveys showed that diving ducks congregated in mixed species flocks within areas of higher food abundance. Mixed species flocks were common in nearshore areas, likely because energy-dense foods (Amphipoda and Chironomidae) were abundant in the narrow zone of shallow water, close to shore. Although macroinvertebrate numbers likely affected habitat use by diving ducks, birds did not greatly reduce abundance of macroinvertebrates. It is unlikely that exploitative competition was occurring and interference competition appeared below threshold levels that would cause species to spatially segregate. Overall, our results suggest that food availability is not a limiting factor for buffleheads, common goldeneyes, or long-tailed ducks wintering on northeastern Lake Ontario.

Variability and seasonality of North Atlantic climate during the early Holocene:: evidence from Faroe Island lake sediments	HOLOCENE												Based on their position in relation to major ocean currents, palaeoclimatic archives in the Faroe Islands are expected to be sensitive recorders of variations in North Atlantic circulation. The multiproxy analysis ( magnetic susceptibility, total carbon, nitrogen and sulphur, biogenic silica, grains > 255 mu m) of a lacustrine record with both winter and summer climate indicators illustrates the variability of Faroese climate during the early Holocene (c. 11 300-10 240 cal. yr BP) and allows comparison with other records in the region. Our high-resolution record suggests a period of predominantly winter cooling and increased storminess centred at c. 11 150 cal. yr BP followed by a period of stability between c. 11 000 and 10 680 cal. yr BP, which correlates with a time when the North Atlantic was particularly free of meltwater incursions. After c. 10 680 cal. yr BP, both winter and summer indicators show an increase in variability broadly synchronous with increased variability at other North Atlantic sites. Within this time period, a predominantly winter cooling centred at c. 10 600 cal. yr BP, a winter/summer cooling centred at c. 10 450 cal. yr BP and a winter/summer cooling centred at c. 10 300 cal. yr BP are recorded. These distinctive coolings correspond to periods of ice core delta O-18 inferred lowered atmospheric temperatures over Greenland and the reoccurrence of meltwater outbursts at c. 10 600, 10 500 and 10 350 cal. yr BP.

Seasonal Variations in the Vertical Structure of Pelagian Water Stratum in the Southern Baikal	WATER RESOURCES												For the first time, T,S-analysis was used to determine the specifics of seasonal variations in the vertical structure of Lake Baikal active layer. In the under-ice period, the active layer includes the under-ice, top winter, and upper intermediate water masses. The under-ice water mass, unlike other masses, shows an increase in mineralization to 100.74 mg/kg, which corresponds to a release of 71.1 g salt under 1 m(2) of water surface in a layer 0-40 m in the process of salt freezing out during ice cover formation and accretion. In the phases of mixing (homothermy), the water masses of the active layer transform into a surface homogeneous mass. In summer and autumn, surface and upper intermediate water masses, separated by a water mass of summer thermocline can be identified. A specific feature of the summer thermocline water mass is the increased sum of ions because of an increase in concentration at the decay of organic matter accumulating in the bottom part of the thermocline. The existence of the under-ice water mass and the water mass of summer thermocline was established in Lake Baikal for the first time. In the deep-water zone (>250 m), except for the bottom parts, the lower water masses (the lower intermediate and the deep) are permanent, their characteristics remaining stable during the year. The changes in the bottom water mass are due to the character of the processes of bottom water renewal.

However, our understanding of the underlying causes and effects of intra-annual turnover remains limited. In this study, we performed a two-season investigation of the phytoplankton composition in the lakes of the Yangtze River catchment in China in spring and summer 2012, which covered a regional spatial scale. We analyzed the Sorensen pairwise dissimilarity (beta(sor)) between the two seasons, their driving factors, and effects on resource use efficiency in phytoplankton. The results showed that the changes in phytoplankton composition from spring to summer were not synchronous among these lakes. The spatial environmental characteristics, temporal changes in environmental variables and the initial phytoplankton composition together explained the variation in beta(sor) for phytoplankton, and their explanatory powers and primary driving variables depended on the phytoplankton taxonomic groups. Among the driving variables, increased nitrogen level and seasonal temperature difference will promote spring-summer community turnover and then improve the phosphorus use efficiency of phytoplankton community. The species diversity of the initial community might increase its stability and slow the spring-summer shift in phytoplankton, especially in cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta. Our study highlights the understanding of the patterns and underlying causes of temporal beta diversity in freshwater phytoplankton communities.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													2045-7758					JUL	2021	11	13					8897	8909		10.1002/ece3.7724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7724		JUN 2021						34257935					WOS:000658034400001
J	Oberholster, PJ; Botha, AM				Oberholster, Paul J.; Botha, Anna-Maria			Dynamics of phytoplankton and phytobenthos in Lake Loskop (South Africa) and downstream irrigation canals	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The relationships between water quality and the phytoplankton community within Lake Loskop and irrigation canals downstream were studied over a period of one year from April 2009 to March 2010. The phytoplankton assemblage in Lake Loskop during this sampling period was dominated by the phytoplankton Ceratium hirundinella, with the highest biovolume of 12.1 mm(3) l(-1) recorded in late summer during January 2010. From the data generated the algae assemblage showed a clear trend in the two canals during the study period and also among sampling stations. The filamentous macroalgae Cladophora glomerata dominated the phytobenthos of the two irrigation canals during the whole sampling period. However, much higher biovolumes (8.5; 6.3 mm(3) l(-1)) of Cladophora glomerata and total phosphates were observed in the long and short irrigation canals during lake overturn in the months of March and September, while much lower average biovolumes (2.4; 1.5 mm(3) l(-1)) were recorded during the summer months. The dominance of the water column phytoplankton assemblage in the two irrigation canals by Ceratium hirundinella, Fragilaria crotonesis, Closterium stellenboschense and Closterium polystictum during autumn and spring was related to the observed lake overturn. Withdrawal of irrigation water from the upper-hypolimnia during these two time periods transported phytoplankton species usually occurring in the epilimnion zone of Lake Loskop into the irrigation canals. This phenomonen resulted in these species becoming dominant during autumn in the water column of the two irrigation canals downstream of Lake Loskop. The phytoplankton assemblage data generated from this study can be used for management and control of nuisance macroalgae like Cladophora glomerata in irrigation canals.

Phosphorus Deposition in a Low-Phosphorus Landscape: Sources, Accuracy and Contribution to Declines in Surface Water P	ECOSYSTEMS												Atmospheric deposition can be an important source of phosphorus (P) to watersheds in geologically low-P landscapes like the Precambrian Shield, in south-central Ontario. Recent observations in this region of declining total P (TP) concentrations in streams and lakes, as well as P limitation in vegetation, prompted this investigation into the potential contributing role of atmospheric deposition. Long-term (1980-2014) measurements of bulk TP deposition at four monitoring stations, as well as wet-only deposition at one of the sites (2012-2014) and pollen measurements in 2014, were used to assess the potential contribution of biogenic sources to TP deposition in the region. Ratios of phosphorus to potassium (P:K) in historical bulk deposition and variability in P deposition among the four sites indicated that continuously open, bulk deposition collectors are enriched in 'local' biogenic sources of P, particularly in the summer, fall and spring months. Furthermore, in 2014 pollen could account for as much as 30% of bulk TP deposition, and pine trees (Pinus strobus) were the most important source of pollen (> 75% of collected pollen). In contrast, winter bulk deposition was the least affected by local, biogenic sources, and likely best reflects net P inputs to this region from long-range (that is, external to the watershed) sources. Catchment input-output budgets for P that use measured annual bulk deposition totals as inputs are generally strongly positive (indicating net retention/accumulation of P within watersheds), whereas annual budgets calculated using extrapolated winter deposition are in approximate balance. Balanced P budgets are more consistent with regional observations of declining surface water TP and P limitation in terrestrial vegetation. Importantly, there was no significant decline in winter TP deposition over the period of record (1980-2014), which suggests that changes in regional deposition are not responsible for declines in surface water TP. Although we recommend extrapolating winter bulk deposition measurements to approximate annual atmospheric TP input to terrestrial ecosystems in non-dusty, oligotrophic landscapes such as this, local sources of P, particularly pollen, are likely important seasonal sources of P nutrition to lakes.

Environmental and climatic factors affecting winter hypoxia in a freshwater lake: evidence for a hypoxia refuge and for re-oxygenation prior to spring ice loss	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Low dissolved oxygen, or hypoxia, is a common phenomenon in ice-covered lakes in winter. We measured dissolved oxygen (DO) before, during, and after ice-over to characterize the timing, severity, and spatial variability of winter hypoxia in Upper Red Rock Lake, Montana, home to one of the last remaining lacustrine populations of endemic Montana Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus). Unlike most previous investigations of winterkill-prone lakes, we observed considerable horizontal spatial variability in DO, a non-linear winter oxygen depletion rate, and lake-wide re-oxygenation 2-4 weeks prior to spring ice loss. Parts of the upper 1 m of the lake and near stream mouths remained well-oxygenated even during late winter. DO levels were strongly associated with maximum daily air temperature. Our analysis of a 28-year weather record revealed large interannual variability in risk of winter hypoxia, with a slight declining trend in winter severity (number of days with maximum air temperatures <= 0 degrees C) in Upper Red Rock Lake. The approach we used in our study provides a useful framework for quantifying and mapping the seasonal dynamics of the extent and severity of winter hypoxia, and for identifying critical winter habitats.

In summer signs of pollution are at their lowest level although use of the complex is at its peak. Conversely, the amoebic flora, which is independent of the usual criteria of pollution, predominates in summer, and serves as a marker for the need for increased surveillance.

Seasonal diatom community responses to development and climate change in Lake George, an oligotrophic lake in the Adirondack Mountains	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake George is a highly monitored, oligotrophic lake that experiences widespread tourism in the summer months. The southern basin has more shoreline development than the northern basin, resulting in a south to north gradient of anthropogenic impairment. This study aimed to assess differences in nearshore diatom communities regarding gradients of water chemistry and watershed development throughout the lake. Using redundancy analyses, water chemistry explained more variation within diatom assemblages than watershed variables. Seasonal comparisons of watershed types, based on development, revealed SPC values to be significantly higher in the southern basin in all three seasons (spring, summer, and autumn). Among the three seasons, summer demonstrated the best potential for further monitoring of diatom communities with the north and south basins demonstrating differences in Shannon-Weiner (H ') diversity index values and proportions of Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis, and Lindavia lemanensis. Dominant diatoms from previous studies in the lake were compared to present populations and showed a concomitant reduction in Stephanodicus spp. and Melosira spp. while smaller centric species continue to increase. Given the differences between the two basins, climate change is likely to manifest differently in the southern, more productive basin than the northern basin.

Empirical models for forecasting changes in the phenology of ice cover for Canadian lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In situ and remote-sensed data on freeze-up and break-up dates for lakes spread over much of Canada were used to develop and validate simple regression models linking lake ice phenology to climatic conditions and lake morphometry. The primary variables affecting fall freeze-up dates were the fall date when 30-day smoothed air temperatures reached 0 degrees C and lake mean depth; the primary variables affecting spring break-up date were the spring date when 30-day smoothed air temperatures reached 0 degrees C, solar elevation on that date, and the number of days over winter when 30-day smoothed air temperatures were <0 degrees C. These models were used to project potential impacts of climate change on ice phenology across Canada; by 2055 (under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC SRES) A2 emissions scenario), freeze-up dates were projected to be an average of 10 days later. Break-up dates were projected to be from 0 to 16 days earlier, with greater changes occurring at higher latitudes. These projections were similar to those independently derived using a mechanistic ice phenology model.

Resilience of zooplankton communities in temperate reservoirs with extreme water level fluctuations	INLAND WATERS												The importance of zooplankton as a food resource for higher trophic levels, including threatened and endangered salmon species, highlights the need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that structure reservoir food webs. Pelagic plankton are the dominant primary and secondary producers in reservoirs experiencing extreme water level fluctuations (WLFs). In these systems, we might expect WLFs to promote predictable and homogenized biotic communities. Here we explored whether spring and summer zooplankton communities are homogenized in Pacific Northwest (USA) flood-control reservoirs managed with annual extreme WLFs. In addition, we evaluated whether community resilience is present in a reservoir that has been drained annually since 2011 for salmon passage. We sampled 4 reservoirs during spring and summer, including 1 that was fully drained, resulting in a lotic riverine environment, for 1 week each fall from 2012 to 2016. We found low beta diversity across reservoirs, indicating homogenized communities. Additionally, we did not observe changes across sample years or increased differences in species composition compared to historical data. Instead, we observed strong seasonal transitions that were predictably repeated each year. Our findings support the hypothesis that extreme WLFs, under which these reservoirs have been managed for >50 years, may have structured reservoir zooplankton communities such that they are resilient to even more dramatic draining. Understanding how WLFs and reservoir draining may impact zooplankton will be critical to minimizing unintended consequences of reservoir management on aquatic food webs.

For both lakes, GPP was approximately 30% lower during the warmer and dryer spring of 2012 compared to 2011. Seasonal changes in GPP and R were negatively correlated to water column stability (GPP r = -0.82, p < 0.001; R r = -0.80, p < 0.001). Periods with high stability coincided with warm waters which reduced mixing and internal inputs of nutrients from hypolimnetic waters. GPP was accordingly suppressed in both lakes during summer due to a combination of nutrient depletion and photo-inhibition, which was more pronounced during summer. These conditions were more prevailing during the warm and dry year of 2012, indicating ecosystem responses in carbon cycling to the ongoing regional climate changes.					; Brandão, Luciana/N-7947-2018; Bezerra-Neto, José/K-8051-2018; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/S-6110-2018; Staehr, Peter/J-3693-2013; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019; Brighenti, Ludmila/H-5559-2016; Bezerra-Neto, Jose Fernandes/K-8051-2018	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/0000-0002-1580-4875; Bezerra-Neto, Jose Fernandes/0000-0002-8281-0810													1432-9840	1435-0629				JUN	2015	18	4					589	604		10.1007/s10021-015-9851-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9851-3													WOS:000354126300004

The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) can provide hourly monitoring of the dynamics of algal blooms (eight times per day), and has potential in observing the horizontal and vertical movement of cyanobacterial blooms. Based on the fractional floating algae cover (FAC), the diurnal dynamics and migration of floating algal blooms were evaluated, and the horizontal and vertical migration speed of phytoplankton was estimated from the proposed algorithm in two eutrophic lakes, Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu in China. The locations, number, and area of algal bloom patches showed the hotspots and horizontal movement of bloom patches. The spatial and seasonal variations of the vertical velocities indicated that both the rising and sinking speed were higher in summer and autumn than those in spring and winter. The factors affecting diurnal horizontal and vertical migrations of phytoplankton were analyzed. Diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and temperature had significant positive relationships with FAC in the morning. Wind speed contributed 18.3 and 15.1% to the horizontal movement speed in Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu, respectively. The rising speed was more related to DNI and DHI in Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu with contribution of 18.1 and 16.6%. The horizontal and vertical movement of algae provide important information for understanding phytoplankton dynamics and the prediction and warning of algal blooms in lake management.					; Hu, Minqi/MSZ-3308-2025; Xiong, Junfeng/LJM-0365-2024; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Cao, Zhigang/L-5336-2017; Cao, Zhigang/L-5337-2017	Xue, Kun/0000-0003-3413-0770; Wu, Jinghui/0000-0002-6788-1055; Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906; Xiong, Junfeng/0000-0002-9409-5797; Guo, Yuyu/0000-0002-3627-7015; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				JUL 15	2023	240								120099	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120099		MAY 2023						37216785					WOS:001012406800001
J	Novaes, JLC; Carvalho, ED				Costa Novaes, Jose Luis; Carvalho, Edmir Daniel			Reproduction, food dynamics and exploitation level of Oreochromis niloticus (Perciformes: Cichlidae) from artisanal fisheries in Barra Bonita Reservoir, Brazil	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), which is exotic to South America, is the most common species caught in artisanal fisheries at the Barra Bonita Reservoir, Southeastern Brazil. This species is of great socioeconomic importance for the region and keeps active a population of about 500 fishers. In the present study we assess reproduction, food dynamics and level of exploitation of O. niloticus, caught by artisanal fisheries in the Barra Bonita Reservoir. Specimens were collected monthly, from July 2004-June 2005, and a total of 1 715 specimens were analyzed. Each specimen was examined to obtain biological and biometric data: standard length (cm), total weight (g), reproductive data (sex and stage of maturation), and stomach contents (empty, partly full, and full). We also estimated the sex ratio (by macroscopic observation of gonads), reproductive period (by ovarian development and seasonal average of gonadosomatic index in females), and feeding habits (by stomach contents). The possible relationship between abiotic factors and the reproductive period was statistically verified using Spearman's Rank Correlation. The FiSAT (ELEFAN I) package was used to assess growth parameters, mortality rates and to infer exploitation rate from standard length frequencies. The O. niloticus population had a sex ratio of 1.3:1 (M:F). Results indicated that ripe females were captured throughout the year, with a higher frequency during the winter-2004 (with a frequency of 59%, at a mean temperature of 20.5 degrees C), and in spring-2004 (with a frequency of 60.5% at a mean temperature of 21.18 degrees C). The GSI mean values obtained by season were: winter-2004: 1.71; spring-2004: 1.72; summer-2005: 0.80, and autumn-2005: 1.19. The Spearman correlation indicated positive values with respect to pH, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity, transparency and chlorophyll a, and negative values with respect to temperature, accumulated rainfall and altimetric benchmark. The main food items were phytoplankton and periphytic algae, observed in 99.6% of the analyzed stomachs. The estimated growth and mortality parameters were: L infinity=33.60cm, k=0.63/year, longevity= 4.76years, Z=2.81/year, M=1.20/year and F=1.61/year. The weight-length relationship was Ln Wt=-2.8532+2.8835 Ln Lp. The estimated yield per recruit values were as follows: E=0.570, E-max=0.776, E-0.1=0.604 and E-0.5=0.349. These results indicate that a well established population of O. niloticus is present at Barra Bonita Reservoir; with an active reproduction throughout the year, more intense during winter and spring, and that O. niloticus is a phytoplanktophagus species. There were no indications that this species is being over-fished, we therefore recommend that, due to its exotic condition, no restrictions need to be taken on its fishing activities.

We report (1) relationships between optical properties (OPs) and optically active substances (OASs); (2) relationships between inherent (IOPs) and apparent (AOPs) optical properties; and (3) the seasonal variability in OASs and OPs. Light absorption was dominated by the particulate fraction. The contributions of phytoplankton pigments and unpigmented components were similar. The best predictors of total particulate absorption, unpigmented particulate absorption, turbidity and vertical attenuation coefficient were total suspended solids or their ash content. Many OASs and OPs varied seasonally. The concentrations of OASs were higher during spring and summer, resulting in lower transparency and higher turbidity. However, mass-specific absorption coefficients displayed lower values during spring and summer. Thus, the higher light attenuation observed during spring and summer resulted from higher concentrations of relatively less absorptive OASs. Collectively, these results suggest that: (1) light extinction is enhanced during spring and summer; (2) the enhanced light extinction is due to changes in the particulate fraction; (3) the enhanced light extinction is mostly due to an increase in the amount of particulate material; and (4) the increase of particulate matter also enhanced light extinction through increased scattering.

A good agreement was observed between loss rates of Pmobile in the top 10 cm of the sediment from winter to summer, P release rates measured in undisturbed sediment cores, and rates of P accumulation in the lake water from winter to summer (22, 32, and 30 mg of p m(-2) day(-1), respectively). This suggests that the operationally defined Pmobile was the sediment P fraction responsible for the internal loading in the lake. In autumn 2001, 11 mg of aluminum (Al) L-1, equivalent to 31 g of Al m(-2), was added to the lake water. This dosage represented a 4:1 molar ratio between Al and P-mobile. The Al treatment significantly decreased lake water P, and P precipitated from the lake water was recovered as Al-bound P in the sediment after the treatment. Internal P loading was reduced by 93% in the two posttreatment years, relative to 2001. Accordingly, average summer concentrations of total P in lake water declined from 1.28 (SE = 0.17) and 1.3 (SE 0.14) mg L-1 in the two pretreatment years to 0.09 (SE 0.01) and 0.13 ISE = 0.01) mg L-1 in the posttreatment years. pH levels remained unchanged relative to pretreatment levels, while the total alkalinity was reduced from 3.2 (SE = 0.04) to 2.7 (SE = 0.03) mequiv L-1.

J	Roy, CL; St-Louis, V; House, J				Roy, Charlotte L.; St-Louis, Veronique; House, Jared			Seasonal distribution of the invasive snail, Bithynia tentaculata, within infested waterbodies in Minnesota, USA, including waterfowl migration	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The introduction of the invasive faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata) and its associated trematodes, Cyathocotyle bushiensis, Sphaeridiotrema spp., and Leyogonimus polyoon, has resulted in recurring waterfowl die-offs during spring and fall migration in the Great Lakes Region, especially of Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and American coots (Fulica americana). Here we evaluated faucet snail habitat use and abundance in infested waterbodies in northcentral Minnesota (USA) during spring, summer, and fall of 2011-2013. We collected snail samples, along with data on abiotic and biotic variables, at 12 snail-infested waterbodies. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to develop models that explain variability in the distribution and abundance of snails within waterbodies. Models containing water depth consistently received considerable support in waterbodies where depth varied substantially; however the specific shape of these relationships varied among waterbodies. Snails used a wide range of depths, but were more likely to be present in deep portions (similar to 6 m) of large lakes in all seasons. We found seasonal differences in the location of rafts of migrating scaup, with use of areas closer to shore in the spring, and use of areas shallower than those used most by faucet snails. Patterns in snail distribution likely influenced the availability of snails for consumption by migrating waterfowl; differences in portions of large lakes used by migratory waterfowl as stopover sites and by faucet snails may reduce exposure of migrating waterfowl to trematodes in infested lakes. However, some spatio-temporal overlap between snails and scaup occurs and explains the continuing loss of waterfowl to trematodiasis.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				OCT	2016	18	10					2923	2941		10.1007/s10530-016-1183-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1183-5													WOS:000382847100015

Though food resources increased 6 - 10 fold in the course of eutrophication, only rotifers and Epistylis increased accordingly. Probably as a result of increased predation pressure crustaceans increased only twice. The seasonal pattern of metazoans and protozoans (flagellates, sarcodines, ciliates) were analysed for 12 and 3 years, resp. During winter and spring, large heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates dominated the zooplankton and were responsible for a pronounced - formerly underestimated - grazing pressure on phytoplankton. In early summer, metazoan filter-feeders were often able to cause a significant reduction of phyto- and protozooplankton. However, during some years, phytoplankton declined in the absence of a pronounced grazing pressure. Field data and experiments revealed that predators were able to regulate the density of cladocerans in early summer (mainly cyclopoids) and summer (mainly Leptodora, smelt and fish juveniles).

In this study, the behavior and physiology of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were monitored in the discharge canal of a thermal generating station on Lake Erie during two critical thermal periods; winter and summer. The spring transition was also monitored. Behavioral responses were quantified by monitoring movement, distribution, and abundance with traditional radio telemetry, underwater videography, and activity transmitters. Cardiac function was monitored with hard-wired Doppler flow probes to assess physiological adjustments. At lower temperatures during the winter and spring, smallmouth bass spent most of their time in the warmest and most thermally variable areas of the discharge canal and made few behavioral adjustments on both large- and fine-scales. At these times cardiac function was highly correlated with temperature. As temperatures increased in the summer this trend began to reverse with a decrease in the correlation between cardiac function and temperature until a critical point at approximately 25-30degreesC where most smallmouth bass attempted to locate thermal refugia by leaving the untempered areas of the discharge canal. Cardiac function of bass experimentally forced to stay in the high and dynamic thermal conditions was completely independent of temperature. This work illustrates the variation in behavioral and physiological responses associated with exposure to different thermal regimes and indicates the utility of integrative studies in assessing the impacts of anthropogenic influences.

Instrumented carp arrived at these 2 areas with relative synchrony from different parts of the lake. Commercial fishermen, advised of these locations, harvested 46,400 kg of fish.

In this paper, an empirical model for the remote sensing inversion of the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration in Erhai Lake was established using ground monitoring Chl-a concentration data and multispectral remote sensing data from environmental satellites from 2010 to 2017. The average absolute error and relative error were 1.92 mg/m(3) and 22%, respectively. A 10-year remote sensing inversion of Erhai blooms identified the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of blooms and showed that the occurrence frequency of blooms was 37%, and they were mainly in the form of light algal blooms at a local scale. Moderate and severe blooms occurred at a frequency of 42%, mainly from Oct. to Jan. Moderate algal blooms were distributed along the southern and northern coasts and in coastal areas, while severe algal blooms were distributed in the northern section and across the entire lake. During the bloom period, the growth rate of the bloom area reached 102 km(2)/d, which was faster than the reduction rate (90 km(2)/d). Bloom events generally lasted for 6-37 days. The inflow of pollution sources led to a higher frequency of blooms in the coastal zone than in the lake center, and the frequency in the northern section was nearly twice as high as that in the southern section. Most blooms in Erhai Lake occurred from late summer to winter (i.e., Jul. to Jan. of the following year) because of the higher average air temperature (AT) and lower wind speed (WS) in winter and spring and the amount of precipitation in summer and autumn. The remote sensing method captured the high-risk areas and the spatial-temporal evolution trend of algal blooms, and the model provided support for the prevention and control of lake algal blooms; however, this work should be complemented by ground monitoring data for cloudy days.					; Cao, Rui/B-1434-2016	Tuo, Youcai/0000-0002-7032-0873; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				MAR	2021	61								101201	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101201													WOS:000632609300006

Samples were taken in three transects (at a depth of 0.5 m and at 5 m intervals). It was noted that macrobenthos only inhabit depths to 10 m. Laminar sediments from 15 m to 29 m indicate that macrobenthos never inhabit the deepest part of the lake in spite of temporary oxygen abundance (between 15 and 20 m during the winter and spring mixing periods). The largest diversity and biomass of macrozoobenthos was observed in the littoral zone at a depth of 0.5 m. At a depth of 5 m in the characean stands and at a depth of 10 m the number and biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates were significantly smaller. The reason for the decrease of benthos density seems to be gradual oxygen depletion.

Understanding the relationships between land cover metrics and pond nutrients are of great significance to enhance water contamination prediction efficiencies and guide land use planning in agricultural watersheds. In this context, the present study aims to investigate the seasonal variations in the N and P concentrations in 28 ponds in a developed agricultural watershed in central China in 2019. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to assess the relationships of the pond water N and P concentrations with multi-scale land cover patterns. Besides the pond water ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentrations, the total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved phosphorus (DP) concentrations in the investigated ponds were higher in summer than those observed in other seasons. The hierarchical partitioning model results demonstrated a spatial consistency in scale effects of land cover metrics on the pond hydrochemical parameters in the different seasons. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the land cover patterns better predicted the variations in the pond water N and P concentrations at the 100 m buffer zone scale in spring and summer, as well as at the 50 m buffer zone scale in fall and winter. Among the land cover metrics considered in this study, the orchard area proportion (POR), landscape shape index (LSI), and largest patch index (LPI) showed the highest significant correlations with the pond water N and P concentrations. The results of this study provide valuable information for effective land use management to control pond water pollution and promote sustainable development in agricultural watersheds.

The late spring soil moisture variation over the TP and its influences on the plateau summer monsoon are analysed. The results show that the TP soil moisture variation is non-uniform, and spring soil moisture over the northeastern TP shows an increasing trend, while the western TP (especially the peripheral area) renders a significantly decreasing trend. When the I-TPSM shows positive (negative) anomalies (i.e., spring soil moisture over the northeastern TP is higher (lower), soil moisture over the western TP is lower (higher) than normal), the plateau summer monsoon may be stronger (weaker). Anomalous variations in spring TP soil moisture can eventually affect the plateau summer monsoon by changing atmospheric circulation, diabatic heating, and water vapour transportation. It is found that when the I-TPSM exhibits positive anomalies, diabatic heating over the centre and eastern TP is remarkably enhanced, and warm and humid moisture from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and cold air from high latitudes merge over the central and eastern TP; coupled with lower-level convergence and upper-level divergence, all these contribute to an increase in plateau summer monsoonal precipitation. When the I-TPSM shows negative anomalies, diabatic heating over the centre and eastern TP is weakened, the anomalous cyclone to the south of the TP hinders warm and humid air flows transportation to the TP, and the anomalous anticyclone to the southeast of Lake Baikal weakens cold air to the south; coupled with weakened convergence and upwards motion, these factors all lead to a decrease in plateau summer monsoonal precipitation.

In 2011, the lake and the Richelieu River reached historical flood levels, raising questions about the influence of climate change on the watershed. The objectives of this work are to model the hydrology of the watershed, construct a reservoir model for the lake and to analyze flooding trends using climate simulations. The basin was modeled using the HSAMI lumped conceptual model from Hydro-Quebec with a semi-distributed approach in order to estimate the inflows into Lake Champlain. The discharge at the Richelieu River was computed by using a mass balance equation between the inputs and outputs of Lake Champlain. Future trends were estimated over the 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 periods using a large number of outputs from general circulation models and regional climate models downscaled with constant scaling and daily translation methods. While there is a certain amount of uncertainty as to future trends, there is a decreasing tendency in the magnitude of the mean spring flood. A flood frequency analysis showed most climate projections indicate the severity of most extreme spring floods may be reduced over the two future periods although results are subject to a much larger uncertainty than for the mean spring flood.

The most pronounced diel vertical migration by zooplankton (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Bosmina meridionalis) occurred in August (winter) when Anabaena was subdominant and in January (summer) when the epilimnion was shallowest but Anabaena was at near-maximum concentration. From November to June when juvenile bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) were pelagic, there was no marked ascent by zooplankton except in January. In September and October (spring) when pelagic bullies were absent the zooplankton was distributed throughout most of the water column with only a slight ascent at night. All zooplankton species were found in the anoxic hypolimnion sometimes for much of the day. Cyanobacterial toxicity may suppress ascent during diel vertical migration of zooplankton and hypolimnetic anoxia may limit the extent of descent of some species. Pelagic bullies may confine zooplankton, especially Ceriodaphnia dubia, to about, or below, the oxycline for much of the diel period.																			0003-9136					FEB	1990	117	4					385	404																WOS:A1990CV55500001

Ellen			A comparison of methods for sampling round goby in rocky littoral areas	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Invasion of the round goby Neogobius melanostomus in the Great Lakes has prompted investigation into qualitative and quantitative sampling strategies. Design of an optimal sampling strategy to monitor expanding round goby populations should consider the accuracy, precision, and associated costs of gears and their deployment strategies. The goal of this study was to compare three common, low-cost, readily available gear types used to sample round goby (gill nets, minnow traps, and trotlines) in terms of catch rates, size selectivity, and bycatch. During fall assessments, baited minnow traps were the most effective at collecting round goby, followed by trotlines and monofilament gill nets. Minnow traps were more selective of small round goby, while trotlines and gill nets were more selective of larger individuals. Bycatch associated with minnow traps and trotlines was lower than that associated with gill nets. Seasonal variation in gear effectiveness was apparent: during spring, gill nets caught 216 round goby and minnow traps caught none, while during the fall only 11 round goby were captured in gill nets and 868 were captured in minnow traps. During summer assessments, diel movements were evident, as gill nets set during periods of low or no light captured more round goby than those set during the day. The cost-benefit analysis indicated that passive gears had lower scores (i.e., were more cost-effective) than active gears. The financial cost of the three gears indicated that the cost per round goby varied among gears and seasons. Our results demonstrated that baited minnow traps set overnight were the most efficient, easily deployed, cost-effective gear and exhibited less variable catch rates during late summer and fall than either gill nets or trotlines.

Ciliate abundance varied from 300 to 24,200 cells/1. Peak densities were observed during mixis for all sampling depths and in May-June in the cold aerobic hypolimnion. During the rest of the year, the species composition varied greatly with depth and season. Small algivorous prostomatids and large mixotrophic oligotrichs were most abundant in the euphotic zone during summer. Small filter-feeders were present at each depth throughout the study whereas haptorids and large size taxa were restricted to 15 m depth during spring and autumn. The highest density of ciliates occurred in the deep (40 m) cold aerobic hypolimnion due to the major spring development of the scuticociliate Uronema nigricans. This species seems to be adapted to cold and dilute freshwater habitats. Evidence for a major impact of availability and diversity of appropriate feed in determining ciliate composition at different seasons and depths are given.					; Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021	Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544; 													0003-9136					SEP	1998	143	2					227	255																WOS:000076817700006
J	Marks, R; Beldowska, M				Marks, R; Beldowska, M			Air-sea exchange of mercury vapour over the Gulf of Gdansk and southern Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The total gaseous mercury (TGM) in air over the coastal station at Hel and over the southern Baltic Sea was measured during the summer and winter conditions. Recorded 30-min resolution TCM data showed both higher concentrations and variability during the summer compared to the winter conditions. The summer TGM data ranged from 1.1 to 7.5 ng m(-3) while the winter data ranged from 0.8 to 4.4 ng m(-3). The TGM content in air over the southern Baltic Sea indicated that, in general, during the summer conditions, the sea-to-air transport of gaseous mercury dominated, while during the winter season, a tendency of gaseous mercury to sink into the water has been found. The evidences of enhanced water-to-air transfer of mercury vapour were noted, in particular, over the shallow waters of the Gulf of Gdansk under the strong water-to-air temperature gradients. Obtained results indicate that under such conditions, the coastal waters could act as a significant source of mercury vapour that may contribute to the overall budget of atmospheric mercury over the Baltic proper.

The expansion and shrinkage of lakes/reservoirs may have impacts on meteorological characteristics and the underlying surface conditions in the surrounding areas, which would further affect energy and water vapor fluxes. In this study, the expansion and shrinkage of the Guanting Reservoir during 2013-2017 were analyzed using remote sensing data. Data collected from the Huailai Remote Sensing Experiment Station were used to analyze the impact of reservoir expansion/shrinkage on energy and water vapor fluxes in the surrounding area. Results showed the annual expansion of the Guanting Reservoir from 2013 to 2017 and a seasonal variation characterized by expansion in spring, shrinkage in summer and autumn, and expansion again in winter was exhibited. Meanwhile, the evapotranspiration (ET) in the surrounding area increased by about 96%, from 446.6 mm in 2013 to 874.7 mm in 2017. In growing season (May to September), the seasonal shrinkage of the reservoir affected ET through net radiation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and deep soil moisture, while in nongrowing season (January to April and October to December), the seasonal expansion increased ET through the distance between 40-m tower and the reservoir, net radiation, and surface soil moisture. In addition, with the reservoir expanding year by year, the difference in ET between the closer site and further site from the reservoir increased obviously, especially in the nongrowing season during the seasonal expansion of the reservoir. The findings of this study are beneficial for ecosystem restoration and sustainable development of lakes/reservoirs in arid and semiarid areas.					; Yang, Xiaofan/P-9140-2019; LIU, Shulin/ABG-9784-2021; XU, Ziwei/LCD-3835-2024	Guo, Ailun/0000-0003-4236-4622; Yang, Xiaofan/0000-0001-7030-7516; XU, TONGREN/0000-0002-1744-8974; Liu, Shaomin/0000-0003-3627-9288													2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 27	2020	125	20							e2020JD032833	10.1029/2020JD032833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD032833													WOS:000588398800005

Lakewater quality was monitored sporadically before 1984, and routinely since then. In the first 3 years since diversion, water quality in the winter has not improved (levels of TP, TN, chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth unchanged), although DRP levels are now low. Summer chlorophylla level has halved, and it covaries significantly with TN level which has also fallen substantially. Summer TP and DRP levels have also more than halved, but remain very high (mean TP 420 mg m-3), primarily because of a large internal P load. Water clarity is still poor because levels of inorganic suspensoids and detritus have remained high.																			0028-8330						1991	25	1					57	61		10.1080/00288330.1991.9516453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1991.9516453													WOS:A1991FK52400004
J	HAWES, I				HAWES, I			LIGHT CLIMATE AND PHYTOPLANKTON PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN MARITIME ANTARCTIC LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The responses of phytoplankton populations to seasonal changes in radiation flux in 2 Antarctic lakes with extensive winter ice-cover are described. A phytoplankton capable of photosynthesis was found throughout the year in both systems. During winter, low incident radiation combined with thick layers of snow and ice prevented in situ photosynthesis becoming detectable. The beginning of spring was marked by a reduction in snow cover which resulted in a considerable increase in surface penetrating radiation. Planktonic algae rapidly adapted to utilize these increased levels efficiently, though they still showed characteristics of strong shade adaptation. Loss of ice cover at the start of the short open water period further increased the radiation levels and a summer population developed which was much less shade adapted. Saturation and photoinhibition effects were widespread during this period as the algae proved unable to utilize high radiation levels efficiently. They were however effective at the radiation fluxes prevalent in the lower part of the rapidly circulating water columns.

This study examines racial differences between eggs and juveniles, and relates juvenile size and survival to egg size. There were no major differences between races for egg incubation times and the percentage of eggs hatching successfully, the latter being high (mean values 76-96%) with a negligible proportion of abnormal alevins (<0.8%). Although there were no significant differences in the lengths of the female parents, both eggs and alevins were significantly larger for the autumn spawners than the spring spawners. Size differences in alevins, especially live weight, were positively related to egg size but not female parent size. Mean percentage survival for juveniles attaining the independent feeding stage was higher for the progeny of autumn spawners (32%) than spring spawners (3%). Racial differences in the egg and alevin stages therefore appear to have a significant effect on subsequent survival, and could be ultimately responsible for the relatively small proportion of spring spawners (only 4-6%) in the Windermere population of charr.																			0022-1112					SEP	1994	45	3					407	415																WOS:A1994PG32300005

Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, Lasionycteris noctivagans and Myotis lucifugus (239 bats) were captured and activity was monitored along transects with microphones to detect species-specific echolocation calls. L. noctivagans and L. cinereus were permanent summer residents while L. borealis moved through the area in the spring and fall and M. lucifugus was generally uncommon. The 1st bats arrived in mid-May and the last left in mid to late September. In the late summer, male L. borealis moved through the area later than females. All species fed primarily along a narrow forested ridge rather than over the marsh or Lake Manitoba. Individual L. cinereus established feeding territories from which they chased other bats. Lactating female L. cinereus and their young roosted in trees in the ridge and allthough each female fed independently of her young, each family group roosted together for over 2 wk after the young were volant.

The results show that the date of last spring frost (LSFD) has a significant decreasing trend. Stations exhibiting significant negative trends are mostly distributed in the eastern Jilin Province and the Midwest of Heilongjiang Province. The date of first fall frost (FFFD) and length of frost-free season (LFFS) both show significant increasing trends. The spatial patterns of stations showing significant positive trends in the FFFD and LFFS are similar, which are mainly located in the middle part of Eastern Inner Mongolia and the south and middle parts of Changbai Mountains. The LFFSs have significant increasing trends with the magnitudes of 0.49 days/decade for RCP2.6, 1.62 days/decade for RCP4.5, and 3.85 days/decade for RCP8.5 during 2006-2100. The southern Liaoning Province and the northwestern NEC will experience the longer LFFS under each scenario between 2071 and 2100. The frost-free season indices have significant correlations with the Northern Hemisphere Polar Vortex Area index. The atmospheric circulation patterns of an anticyclonic circulation anomaly prevailed over the Lake Baikal region and a cyclonic circulation anomaly located in the northwest Pacific Ocean in springs and an anticyclonic circulation anomaly prevailed over the south part of the Russian Far East in falls block more cold air flowing into NEC, which result in the earlier LSFD and later FFFD. The adverse patterns in springs and in falls could bring out the later LSFD and earlier LSFD, respectively. Our results could benefit the prevention and reduction of frost disaster and provide a reference for the policy-making of future crop production.

Samples were collected during the periods August 2004 to August 2005 and February to November 2007. The water temperature and the electrical conductivity varied from 1.75 to 33.2 degrees C and 209 to 916 mS cm(-1), respectively. The pH ranged from slightly acidic to alkaline. The cell density of silica-scaled chrysophytes was high in spring and autumn. In total, 35 species of silica-scaled chrysophytes and five unidentified scales (2 Paraphysomonas, 2 Mallomonas and 1 Synura) were observed in the present study. These included 11 species of Paraphysomonadaceae (2 Chrysosphaerella,7 Paraphysomonas, and 2 Spiniferomonas) and 29 species of Mallomonadaceae (23 Mallomonas), and 6 species of Synuraceae (6 Synura).

In China, although phytoplankton PP and affiliated environmental controlling factors have been widely studied in various lake systems, most relevant studies have only focused on individual lakes. As the absence of long-term and large-scale phytoplankton PP measurements, there still exists a large knowledge gap on the spatiotemporal patterns and drivers of phytoplankton PP in China's lakes and reservoirs at a national scale. This study evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of phytoplankton PP and the carbon sequestration capacity (CSC) of China's lakes and reservoirs nationwide by building a vertically generalized production model (VGPM) based on long-term in situ water quality monitoring data. Generally, the seasonal pattern of phytoplankton PP was higher in spring and summer and lower in autumn and winter. Annual phytoplankton CSC was estimated at 18.69 & PLUSMN; 10.7 Tg C yr  1, nearly half of which derives from lakes and reservoirs in China's continental basin and the Yangtze River basin. The relative contributions of 11 potential environmental variables to spatiotemporal changes in phytoplankton PP were quantified in China's nine prominent basins based on multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) regression analysis. Of these 11 potential driving factors, chlorophyll content, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and turbidity were determined to be the major drivers of phytoplankton PP. This study provides the first national scale estimate of phytoplankton PP in China's lakes and reservoirs, which will help us better understand aquatic-based ecosystem C budgets throughout the entire country.

Diatom assemblages were regularly monitored in lowland lotic systems in Hungary (Central Europe) during the unusually dry year of 2012. Highly pronounced changes in diatom composition were observed from spring to autumn. Halophilic taxa (especially Nitzschia sensu lato species) appeared in the dry autumn. In addition, the total relative abundances of halophilic species also increased up to autumn. Abundance of Nitzschia cf. lorenziana and Nitzschia tryblionella showed a positive correlation with chloride and phosphate concentration, while that of other taxa like Tryblionella apiculata or Tryblionella calida showed a positive correlation with the concentration of nitrate. Our findings clearly demonstrated that these halophilic and mesohalophilic diatom taxa were sensitive indicators of even short-term changes in lowland lotic ecosystems, such as the increasing salt concentration from spring to autumn caused by the lack of rainfall and/or environmental loads.

Utilizing a validated three-dimensional flow field model and ecosystem model including a bottom sediment model, the analysis revealed that nutrient concentrations, specifically NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, and PO43-, exhibited pronounced seasonal variations. In the RN_double scenario, NH4+ and NO2- concentrations demonstrated a slight increase of 0.1 mu g/L, respectively, while NO3- concentrations rose by 0.05-0.10 mu g/L in response to precipitation changes. Conversely, in the RN_half scenario, NH4+ and NO2- concentrations decreased, with NO3- seeing a more substantial decline of approximately 0.1 mu g/L, attributed to reduced precipitation. PO(4)3(-) levels exhibited a maximum decrease of 0.03 mu g/L from summer to autumn. Furthermore, simulations limiting nutrient inflows indicated a modest reduction in concentrations: NH4+ decreased by approximately 0.03 mu g/L during summer, and NO2- decreased by around 0.05 mu g/L from spring to summer. The results suggest that while immediate improvements in dissolved oxygen levels are limited, effective long-term nutrient management could stabilize oxygen concentrations and improve overall water quality. These findings underscore the necessity for comprehensive water management strategies to mitigate eutrophication effects and support the ecological health of Lake Biwa.

Spectrometry analysis of HPGe detector was used for measuring the specific activity. The seasonally measured mean activity concentration of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 for sediment samples were 11.9 +/- 1.0, 7.8 +/- 1.0 and 213.4 +/- 3.4 Bq/kg in spring; 9.2 +/- 1.1, 7.9 +/- 1.0 and 205.8 +/- 3.0 Bq/kg in summer; 12.7 +/- 1.5, 8.2 +/- 1.0 and 188.1 +/- 3.1 Bq/kg in autumn; 11.9 +/- 1.6, 9.1 +/- 1.0 and 218.7 +/- 3.0 Bq/kg in winter, respectively. The obtained activity concentrations of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 are all below the recommended values suggested by UNSCEAR (2000) for sediment 35, 30 and 400 Bq/kg, respectively. The ordinary kriging method was used to draw the contour maps using the surfer digital program. RESRAD-BUILD simulation code was used to determine the indoor dose, annual dose rate and cancer risks received and exposed to individuals in the dwellings, which show an increase over a period of 50 years. Two scenario descriptions of changing wall thickness and room dimension were, studied and they shows that the indoor dose and cancer risks increase with wall thicknesses until 50 cm and over a period of 50 years, as well as the increase of room size increases the internal dose and cancer risks inside the buildings. From the analyzed results it was concluded that the sediments in the Darbandikhan Lake has no risks when used in building construction.					; Hassan, W M S W/J-7330-2012	Jafir, Adeeb Omer/0000-0003-0123-4186; Hassan, W M S W/0000-0001-5401-5441													0969-806X					NOV	2017	140						150	160		10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.02.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.02.010													WOS:000411533500030

This study addresses the potential loss of numerous fish species from the reservoir due to hydraulic diversions. An approach to assess both physical habitat and fish entrainment risk in the Williston Reservoirs was introduced, with a focus on two fish species: bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The modeled results illuminate a seasonal fluctuation in forebay entrainment risk resulting from the operated intakes. The entrainment risk for kokanee in summer is highest, followed by fall and winter, while spring has the least entrainment risk. Modeled results also suggest that kokanee entrainment risks increase with flow rate of the operated intakes. Due to the fish entrainment risk, kokanee density and population decrease during the reservoir regulation, potentially leading to a reduction in the overall kokanee population over time. Conversely, the entrainment risk for bull trout remains limited, and its density and population appear to be unaffected by reservoir regulation and the subsequent fish entrainment risk. These insights hold relevance for optimizing operations in different seasons, and provide valuable input for informed decision-making aimed at mitigating the risks associated with fish entrainment.					; Li, Pengcheng/HJG-7296-2022; Yao, Weiwei/AFT-4956-2022	Zhang, Wenming/0000-0002-8101-4089; Yang, Yang/0000-0002-0797-3361; 													0304-3800	1872-7026				JAN	2024	487								110571	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110571		NOV 2023											WOS:001127866900001

The geoaccumulation index (GI) was calculated to assess the severity of metal pollution. The GI values suggest that, in winter, the lake sediments were polluted slightly with Cu (GI = 0.66-1.34), Zn (GI = 0.59-1.35), Cr (GI = 0.49-0.82) and Pb (GI = 0.60-0.96), and moderately with Cd (GI = 1.03-4.23). The degree of pollution was higher in winter than in summer. By contrast, the degree of pollutionwas higher in summer than in winter for Hg and As. Correlation analysis can be used to identify factors influencing seasonal variations in heavy metals. The concetrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd were negatively correlated with water temperature and hydrodynamic conditions, but positively correlated with organic matter concentration in the sediments and with a sediment particle size of < 63 mu m (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, Hg and As concentrations were affected by redox state and salinity. Among the metals tested, Hg and Cd posed a more serious pollution risk.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024														0275-7540	1029-0370					2014	30	1					1	14		10.1080/02757540.2013.841894	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2013.841894													WOS:000337184000001
J	Pla, S; Catalan, J				Pla, S; Catalan, J			Chrysophyte cysts from lake sediments reveal the submillennial winter/spring climate variability in the northwestern Mediterranean region throughout the Holocene	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												In the last decade, much effort was dedicated to the reconstruction of past climate at high temporal resolution. Here, we show the suitability of chrysophyte cysts from lake sediments for revealing continental climate variability when used in sensitive sites, such as those in high mountains. We demonstrate that altitude is a main factor influencing the present distribution of chrysophytes and develop a transfer function to evaluate the local "altitude anomaly'' on a lake site throughout time. Based on our knowledge of chrysophyte ecology, the altitude anomalies are interpreted as winter/spring climate signatures. The method was applied to a Holocene record from a lake in the Pyrenees showing submillennial climatic variability in this northwestern Mediterranean zone. A warming trend was present from the early Holocene to 4 kyear BP. Comparison with pollen-based reconstructions of summer temperatures denoted a contrasting decrease in continentality between the two parts of the Holocene. Oscillations of 1 cycle per ca. 2,000 years appeared throughout the record. The warmest Holocene winters were recorded during the Medieval Warm Period at ca. AD 900 and 450 and the Roman Warm Period (2.7 - 2.4 kyear BP). Winters in the period AD 1,050 - 1,175 were inferred to be as cold as in the Little Ice Age. The period between 3 and 7 kyear BP showed lower intensity in the fluctuations than in early and late Holocene. The cold event, 8,200 years ago, appeared embedded in a warm fluctuation. Another cold fluctuation was recorded around 9 kyear BP, which is in agreement with Irish and Greenland records.

The difference in latitude between two temperate regions (Poland vs. Croatia) affects the identification of particular environmental factors that subsequently influence the taxon-related indices of rotifers. A study on 10 water bodies found that taxon-trait indices were sensitive in identifying latitude differences, even though extreme weather conditions were not considered, and only two seasons (spring and autumn) were examined. A variable rotifer community, with a high share of rare species, was obtained. We found a distinctiveness of abiotic factors between both countries, indicating a higher trophic state in Poland. Although habitat conditions were more similar in spring compared to the autumn, the percentage of rotifer common taxa was alike in both seasons but variation in distinct species community was clear. Trophic state increase in Poland was reflected in the structure of dominant and distinct species, with a wide range of eutrophy indicators. Comparing how rotifer species respond to environmental conditions is important for developing methods to assess trophic state changes due to climate change. Single species, distinct or rare species, are often the first sign of changes.

J	Liu, Y; Wu, X; Qi, WC				Liu, Yuan; Wu, Xu; Qi, Wenchao			Assessing the water quality in urban river considering the influence of rainstorm flood: A case study of Handan city, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The water quality of urban rivers is subject to fluctuation caused by rainstorm flood. The uncertainty of flooding in a dynamic environment brings about changes in river quality, presenting a significant challenge. Water samples were collected at 7 sampling sites in Handan City of China from January 2020 to August 2023, and 9 water quality parameters (WT, pH, Cond, Do, COD, BOD, NH 3 -N, TP, and TP) were analyzed. Specifically, the spatial and temporal variation of water quality in the Qingzhang River was analyzed. In terms of season, the concentration of water quality parameters in spring and winter was found to be significantly higher than that in summer and autumn. Spatially, the concentration of water quality parameters was lower in the upstream compared to the downstream. Furthermore, it was discovered that the reservoir had a purifying effect on the water quality of the river. Additionally, a comparison of water quality during flood and non -flood periods revealed that the concentration of water quality parameters in the upstream, midstream, and downstream of the Qingzhang River were higher during non -flood periods. These findings indicated that, in comparison to the urbanization factor, the hydrological factor, which results in the runoff carrying nutrients into the Qingzhang River, plays a crucial role in the change of its water quality. Moreover, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method was employed to create a water pollution emergency prediction model for the different sections of the Qingzhang River, and an adaptive urban river water purification strategy was formulated based on its variation patterns. The research results contribute to the theoretical basis for the management of urban rivers and water resources.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2024	160								111941	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111941		MAR 2024											WOS:001215014500001
J	Dunn, EH				Dunn, EH			Mass change during migration stopover: A comparison of species groups and sites	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Hourly mass gain during migratory stopover in spring and fall was estimated for 48 species at three sites on Long Point, Ontario. Estimates were based on regression of size corrected mass at first capture on time of day. Mean mass gain for all species and sites in fall was 0.61% of lean body mass/h, well over the mean estimated gain required to maintain daily energy balance (0.27% of lean body mass/h). In spring, mass gain was 0.50% of lean body mass/h at two sites but only 0.17% at the extreme tip of Long Point, where cold lake temperature in spring probably affects insect abundance. While most species fared well in fall, thrushes did not, perhaps due to poor habitat for ground foraging on Long Point. Except for the eastern tip of Long Point in spring, the study sites compare favorably in mass gain to two other stations in the northern U.S. where similar analyses have been done.																			0273-8570					SUM	2001	72	3					419	432		10.1648/0273-8570-72.3.419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570-72.3.419													WOS:000170048700011

Neil			Seasonality of Holocene hydroclimate in the Eastern Mediterranean reconstructed using the oxygen isotope composition of carbonates and diatoms from Lake Nar, central Turkey	HOLOCENE												A positive shift in the oxygen isotope composition (O-18) of lake carbonates in the Eastern Mediterranean from the early to late Holocene is usually interpreted as a change to drier (reduced precipitation and evaporation (P/E)) conditions. However, it has also been suggested that changes in the seasonality of precipitation could explain these trends. Here, Holocene records of O-18 from both carbonates and diatom silica, from Lake Nar in central Turkey, provide insights into palaeoseasonality. We show how O-18(lakewater) (the difference between spring and summer reconstructed O-18(lakewater)) was minimal in the early Holocene and for most of the last millennium, but was greater at other times. For example, between similar to 4100 and 1600 yr BP, we suggest that increased O-18(lakewater) could have been the result of relatively more spring/summer evaporation, amplified by a decline in lake level. In terms of change in annual mean O-18, isotope mass balance modelling shows that this can be influenced by changes in seasonal P/E as well as inter-annual P/E, but lake level falls inferred from other proxies confirm that there was a mid-Holocene transition to drier climatic conditions in central Turkey.

Isotope stratification of meromictic Lake Trekhtzvetnoe at the White Sea coast (Russia)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Postglacial isostatic uplift of the coastal zone resulted in the formation of isolated lakes along the shores of White Sea developed into permanently stratified (meromictic) lakes. On the basis of monitoring the vertical distribution of selected water quality parameters including temperature, salinity, concentration of major ions, microbial activity, dissolved oxygen and hydrogen sulfide, seasonal changes in the structure of the stratified water column are explored and governing factors identified. Lake Trekhtzvetnoe has a strong vertical stratification with seasonal mixing being confined to the upper part of the water column (mixolimnion). Chemical water composition in the mixolimnion reflects the influence of precipitation with the underlying chemocline being defined by sharp gradients of salinity, dissolved oxygen and hydrogen sulphide levels. We found strong stable isotope stratification of water column in winter-early spring seasons of 2013, 2015 and 2016 and in the early autumn of 2015. The lowest isotope values were obtained near the surface in the mixolimnion. There was a gradual increase of isotope values towards the chemocline reaching the maximum in the bottom layer (monimolimnion). It was found that water in the mixolimnion was isotopically depleted in winter as a result of ice formation and isotopically enriched in the early autumn due to evaporation. Obvious desalination of mixolimnion and upper chemocline from 2012 to 2016 was possibly caused by the increase of precipitation and freshwater inflow in lake supply. Monimolimnion is a stable layer of high salinity, and it has enriched isotope composition that corresponds with meromictic structure of water column.

J	Wahren, CHA; Walker, MD; Bret-Harte, MS				Wahren, CHA; Walker, MD; Bret-Harte, MS			Vegetation responses in Alaskan arctic tundra after 8 years of a summer warming and winter snow manipulation experiment	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We used snow fences and small (1 m(2)) open-topped fiberglass chambers (OTCs) to study the effects of changes in winter snow cover and summer air temperatures on arctic tundra. In 1994, two 60 m long, 2.8 m high snow fences, one in moist and the other in dry tundra, were erected at Toolik Lake, Alaska. OTCs paired with unwarmed plots, were placed along each experimental snow gradient and in control areas adjacent to the snowdrifts. After 8 years, the vegetation of the two sites, including that in control plots, had changed significantly. At both sites, the cover of shrubs, live vegetation, and litter, together with canopy height, had all increased, while lichen cover and diversity had decreased. At the moist site, bryophytes decreased in cover, while an increase in graminoids was almost entirely because of the response of the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. These community changes were consistent with results found in studies of responses to warming and increased nutrient availability in the Arctic. However, during the time period of the experiment, summer temperature did not increase, but summer precipitation increased by 28%. The snow addition treatment affected species abundance, canopy height, and diversity, whereas the summer warming treatment had few measurable effects on vegetation. The interannual temperature fluctuation was considerably larger than the temperature increases within OTCs (< 2 degrees C), however. Snow addition also had a greater effect on microclimate by insulating vegetation from winter wind and temperature extremes, modifying winter soil temperatures, and increasing spring run-off. Most increases in shrub cover and canopy height occurred in the medium snow-depth zone (0.5-2 m) of the moist site, and the medium to deep snow-depth zone (2-3 m) of the dry site. At the moist tundra site, deciduous shrubs, particularly Betula nana, increased in cover, while evergreen shrubs decreased. These differential responses were likely because of the larger production to biomass ratio in deciduous shrubs, combined with their more flexible growth response under changing environmental conditions. At the dry site, where deciduous shrubs were a minor part of the vegetation, evergreen shrubs increased in both cover and canopy height. These changes in abundance of functional groups are expected to affect most ecological processes, particularly the rate of litter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and both soil carbon and nitrogen pools. Also, changes in canopy structure, associated with increases in shrub abundance, are expected to alter the summer energy balance by increasing net radiation and evapotranspiration, thus altering soil moisture regimes.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				APR	2005	11	4					537	552		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00927.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00927.x													WOS:000228179500002

Sulfate concentrations decreased exponentially with depth towards a constant threshold value of 7.6 +/- 6.1-mu-M. Concentration profiles were used to calculate fluxes of sulfate and methane and to estimate the anaerobic mineralization rate. Anaerobic mineralization was highest in autumn which was probably due to an increased sedimentation of easily degradable organic carbon. At high rates (> 600-mu-mol organic carbon.m-2.h-1), sulfate reduction appeared to be limited by sulfate and methanogenesis accounted for over 80% of the anaerobic mineralization. At low anaerobic mineralization rates, measured in winter and spring, sulfate reduction was predominant. There was little methanogenesis below 5 cm depth in the sediment which indicated a rapid decrease of degradable organic matter with depth. There was a remarkable difference, especially in winter, between methane fluxes which were measured in batch experiments and those calculated from the concentration profiles in the sediment. These differences may be due to methane diffusing upward from deep layers.																			0168-2563						1992	16	1					43	61		10.1007/BF00024252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024252													WOS:A1992JN91000002

These lakes span a large gradient in lakewater ionic concentration (fresh through hypersaline) and composition, as well as other physical/chemical variables. Almost all of the study lakes had higher salinities in the late-summer than in the spring. The lakes with spring salinities > 8 gl(-1) showed the largest seasonal increases in salinity. Ionic composition was similar in the spring and late-summer for most lakes. Both ionic concentration (i.e. salinity) and composition were important environmental variables that could account for the different diatom floras in the lakes. Diatom assemblages characteristic of carbonate-dominated and sulfate-dominated waters were identified. Other variables such as water depth and phosphorus concentration were also important. The majority (87%) of diatom taxa had estimated salinity optima < 3 gl(-1). Halophilic diatom taxa had broader tolerances to salinity when compared to the fresh water taxa, however taxa with narrow and broad tolerances could be identified across the salinity gradient. Species diversity was weakly but significantly correlated to lakewater salinity (r(2) = 0.18 to 0.3, P < 0.05). Salinity inference models were developed based on the relationship between the diatom assemblages and the spring, late-summer and average salinity. The correlations between the measured and diatom-inferred salinity, based on the spring (r = 0.95), late-summer (r = 0.94) and average (r = 0.95) salinity data, are high because there was an extremely strong correlation (r = 0.98) between the log transformed spring and late-summer measured salinities. These salinity reconstruction models provide a tool that can be used to infer past climatic changes as part of paleolimnological studies from appropriate closed-basin lakes in British Columbia.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0018-8158					OCT 29	1993	269						179	196		10.1007/BF00028017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00028017													WOS:A1993MK66600021

A semi-analytical algorithm, using reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands, was calibrated for Landsat and Sentinel-2 bands and tested using in situ turbidity measurements. The best performance was found using only the near-infrared band with 12.84% median accuracy and -12.84% bias when comparing in situ radiometric measurements and field data. When satellite-derived turbidity was compared to in situ values, the median accuracy was 31.8% and the bias 13.22%. Monthly climatological turbidity maps revealed spatial heterogeneity in Lake Chascom & uacute;s, with differences observed between the north-west and south-east regions, particularly in summer and winter. Turbidity showed marked seasonal dynamics, with a minimum in autumn and a maximum in spring. Annual climatological turbidity maps showed significant inter-annual variability. Generalized linear models showed turbidity was positively associated with wind speed and photosynthetic active radiation (26.2% of the variability explained). Remote sensing was found to be a fundamental complement to traditional field-based methods for monitoring water quality parameters and allowing a better description of their spatio-temporal variability.

J	Metsaranta, JM; Mallory, FF				Metsaranta, Juha M.; Mallory, Frank F.			Ecology and habitat selection of a woodland caribou population in west-central Manitoba, Canada	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												This study examines the ecology of Rangifer tarandus caribou (woodland caribou) in the Naosap range in west-central Manitoba, Canada. This population is considered to be of high conservation concern because of potential resource-development impacts; therefore, baseline data are required to guide and evaluate the management of this species in this area. Radio-telemetry data were collected every two weeks from February 1998 to April 2001 and used in combination with forest-inventory data to evaluate habitat selection, site fidelity, movement, and grouping patterns. In both summer and winter, selected habitats were mature upland spruce and pine forests, as well as treed muskeg. Hardwood forests were least selected at all scales. Mature coniferous forest was preferred over immature coniferous forests in a pair-wise comparison in winter, but not in summer. Home-range sizes were within expected ranges of variation. Animals used distinct areas in summer and winter, showing broad fidelity to seasonal ranges. However, small shifts in the core areas were observed, particularly in winter. Movement rates and grouping behavior were typical of other caribou. Habitats used in winter were common in the study area, but the ability of the animals to disperse to alternate winter areas is not known.

However, direct monitoring of how such lakes respond to changing environmental conditions is challenging not only because of their remoteness but also because of the scarcity of present and previously observed lake states. At the glacier-proximal Lake Tarfala in the Kebnekaise Mountains, northern Sweden, temperatures throughout the water column at its deepest part (50 m) were acquired between 2016 and 2019. This three-year record shows that Lake Tarfala is dimictic and is overturning during spring and fall, respectively. Timing, duration, and intensity of mixing processes, as well as of summer and winter stratification, vary between years. Glacial meltwater may play an important role regarding not only mixing processes but also cooling of the lake. Attribution of external environmental factors to (changes in) lake mixing processes and thermal states remains challenging owing to for example, timing of ice-on and ice-off but also reflection and absorption of light, both known to play a decisive role for lake mixing processes, are not (yet) monitored in situ at Lake Tarfala.					; Weckstrom, Jan/N-7665-2013; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020; Weckström, Jan/N-7665-2013	Hancke, Marnie/0000-0001-9875-2216; Kirchner, Nina/0000-0002-6371-5527; Weckstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5604-617X; Rosqvist, Gunhild/0000-0002-9195-607X; Korhola, Atte A./0000-0003-2577-6502; Weckstrom, Kaarina/0000-0002-3889-0788; Eriksson, Pia/0000-0002-4331-024X; Kuttenkeuler, Jakob/0000-0003-3337-1900													1523-0430	1938-4246				JAN 2	2021	53	1					69	79		10.1080/15230430.2021.1886577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2021.1886577													WOS:000627321700001

Some aspects in the life cycle of freshwater sponges (Spongillidae, Porifera) from open Lake Baikal	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												A histological analysis of the tissue structure in different species of Baikal sponges was performed. The material was collected at a depth of 3-4 m at the Berezovyi test site (southern Lake Baikal) in various seasons of 2001-2003. During the entire year, representatives of the family Lubomirskiidae had a well-developed irrigation system with numerous choanocyte chambers. In Trochospongilla sp. (Spongillidae) from open Baikal, such a tissue pattern was observed only during the summer time. Annually, these sponges undergo tissue regression, i.e., a reduction of the irrigation system accompanied by changes in the cell composition in autumn with subsequent recovery in spring. The onset and termination of tissue regression are adapted to the environment of Lake Baikal.

Seasonal assessment of water quality and water quality index (WQI) variations, in Jiangsu Kunshan Tianfu National Wetland Park, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Seasonal variations in surface water quality are essential for assessing temporal variations in wetlands pollution due to natural or anthropogenic inputs from both point and non-point sources. The goal of this study was to use established methodologies to estimate the water quality of the Tianfu National Wetland Park based on physicochemical features; sampling was done from eight monitoring locations throughout the wetland region in the summer of 2019 and winter of 2020. The water quality index (WQI) is calculated using the following parameters: Turbidity (NTU), Nitrate, Chlorophyll, TOC, DOC, COD, BOD, Chroma, Ammonium nitrogen, pH, Electric Conductivity, and Total Phosphorus. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's pairwise comparisons with a 5% significance level were used to compare water quality parameters among the monitoring point's data. T-test analysis was used to compare the parameters between summer 2019 and winter 2020 and the difference between the water inlet and the water outlet. Cluster analysis was done on the WQI results using Ward's linkage approach. The analyses of variance (ANOVA) of data revealed statistically significant differences between points of sampling (p < 0.05). The paired t-test revealed significant differences in parameters between summer 2019 and winter 2020; however, all parameters in summer show higher values in the water inlet than water outlet. In winter, TOC, DOC, COD, BOD, Chroma, pH, and Electric Conductivity showed higher values than Turbidity (NTU), Nitrate, Chlorophyll, Ammonium Nitrogen, and Total Pospurus. In general, summer showed higher pollution than winter, and water inlets were more polluted than water outlets indicating that other factors may affect the water quality, such as vegetation cover, temperature, water level, and activities in the wetland during the seasons.

J	WEISHAR, LL; WOOD, WL				WEISHAR, LL; WOOD, WL			AN EVALUATION OF OFFSHORE AND BEACH CHANGES ON A TIDELESS COAST	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY												A 4-yr set of beach and offshore profiles, measured at monthly intervals, is evaluated to determine the effect of wind-wave forcing and long-term lake-level variation on profile change in the Great Lakes [USA, Canada]. This evaluation indicates 3 distinct areas of profile change: the beach-and-berm, the inner-bar and the outer-bar regions. The beach-and-berm region exhibits a classical transition from a narrow highly eroded (winter) profile to a broad fully deposited (summer) profile, during ice free months. The inner bar moves actively under the influence of wind-waves, but appears to lack a well-defined seasonal pattern. The outer bar advances onshore from early spring to early winter in response to lake-level modulation of incident wind-waves. Empirical eigenfunction analysis is applied to these data in order to statistically quantify the significance of these observed changes. This analysis provided confirmation of a hypothesized long-term (years) variation of the outer bar in direct response to lake-level variation.																			0022-4472						1983	53	3					847	858																WOS:A1983RL50300010

Understanding their community traits and symbiosis mechanism is crucial for determining the nature of water ecological environment and the water ecosystem's evolution. However, the dynamics of interspecific and environmental interactions, as well as communitybuilding processes, are currently unclear. Here, the structure feature, construction mechanism, associated symbiosis and environmental response of plankton and zoobenthos communities were studied in a freshwater reservoir. The features of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos communities varied significantly by season. Dispersal limitation played an important role in the construction of phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos communities, and the influence degree decreased in order. Phytoplankton communities showed a stronger distance-decay of similarity than zooplankton communities, while zoobenthos communities did not exhibit any discernible distance-decay of similarity. Co-existence network displayed primarily positive interactions between phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos all year round (92.23% positive in summer, 86.36% positive in autumn, 100% positive in winter and 67.35% positive in spring). Variation partitioning analyses showed that geographical variables had a stronger influence on community distribution than environmental factors. Mantel test revealed that the communities diversity was significantly associated with temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients N and nutrients P. Temperature exhibited the highest explanation rate for seasonal variation in phytoplankton (11.48%, p < 0.001) and zooplankton (16.22%, p < 0.001), according to redundancy analysis. These findings provide a thorough comprehension of the biological communities' dynamic equilibrium in a freshwater reservoir aquatic systems.

J	Qin, MH; Li, DL; Dai, AG; Hua, WJ; Ma, HD				Qin, Minhua; Li, Dongliang; Dai, Aiguo; Hua, Wenjian; Ma, Hedi			The influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation on North Central China precipitation during boreal autumn	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Decadal variations in autumn (September-October-November, SON) precipitation over North Central China since the 1940s are investigated using observations and reanalysis data. They are found to be significantly correlated negatively with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Further analyses indicate that the inter-decadal changes in SON precipitation over North Central China result from anomaly patterns in the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere associated with the PDO. Specifically, during the negative phase of the PDO (1945-1976 and 2003-2014), an anomalous low pressure and cyclonic circulation are seen west of Lake Baikal, while positive pressure anomalies are located over the East Asia-Japan-North Pacific region, which weakens the East Asian trough (EAT). The weakened EAT favours southerly winds over North Central China. The negative pressure anomalies around Mongolia and Lake Baikal induce large-scale ascent motion to the west of the EAT, which also produces southerly advection of warm and moist air into North Central China, leading to increased precipitation there. These results reinforce the notion that PDO has a large impact on SON rainfall over North Central China on decadal timescales and highlight the need to further examine how the PDO induces the Eurasia atmospheric teleconnection pattern (e.g. East Atlantic/Western Russia pattern).

A new Chl-a inversion model was built using in-situ Chl-a and the green-red bands of the 2 m spatial resolution GF-6/PMS image. Combined with fishery data, the relationship between Chl-a concentration and fish resources were revealed. The results show that: (1) High Chl-a concentration area was mainly concentrated in the nearshore intensive islands waters, and Chl-a concentration changes obviously with the change of tidal currents. Chl-a concentration around islands increases, especially downstream of islands. Seasonally, Chl-a concentration is higher in spring and summer, lower in autumn, and lowest in winter. (2) The change of fish eggs and larvae in the water of the Zhoushan archipelago shows consistency with the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of Chl-a. (3) The interaction between tidal currents and islands results in the diverse currents (upstream upwelling and downstream vortex currents) around the islands, promoting vertical water exchange and the uplifting of nutrients, resulting in a high overall Chl-a concentration in the waters around the islands. The diverse flow conditions, the ideal nutrient-rich environment, and the abundant phytoplankton attract a large number of fish to gather and breed in the waters around the islands. (4) Chl-a of intensive island waters is an essential indicator for fish spawning grounds.

In the last century, the peak abundance of nanoplanktonic dinophytes occurred in May and the beginning of June (when the vegetation of the spring algae complex ends) and in November and the first half of December (the end of the development of autumn phytoplankton).

To recover these salmonid populations, an interagency committee is developing a plan to reintroduce fish to tributaries upstream of Shasta Dam and provide juvenile fish passage downstream past the dam. One downstream fish passage alternative involves the collection and transport of juvenile fish from head-of-reservoir locations. A hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) of Shasta Lake and its main tributaries was used to assess where and when water temperatures were favorable for juvenile salmonid collection on the McCloud River arm of the lake under different hydrologic scenarios. The application of anchored and floating temperature curtains (i.e., flexible fabric flow barriers) was examined to assess whether they could be used to improve temperature conditions for juvenile fish by reducing temperatures to within an optimal range. Model results indicated that head-of-reservoir conditions without a temperature curtain were suitable for spring-run Chinook Salmon, fall-run Chinook Salmon, and steelhead but not for winter-run and late-fall-run Chinook Salmon. However, permanent or temporary use of temperature curtains, especially a long floating curtain, may improve conditions for juvenile winter-run and late-fall-run Chinook Salmon by reducing or eliminating lethal water temperatures.

In all the three lakes picoplankton exhibited well visible seasonal patterns. In non-dystrophic lakes spring/early summer abundance peaks were observed while in Lake Flosek two abundance peaks occurred: a smaller one in spring and second, bigger, in autumn. It was noticed that maximal picoplankton abundances did not coincided with abundance peaks of larger phytoplankton. The share of picoplankton in the total phytoplankton community in two less productive lakes (Flosek and Majcz) varied between 7 and 24% during picoplankton abundance peaks and about 5% during the rest of the vegetation season. In Lake Mikolajskie picoplankton's share was noticeable only during the abundance peak (13-6%) while it was insignificant (about 1% of the total phytoplankton biovolume) during the rest of the season.

Diurnal analysis of precipitation as well as time series analysis of precipitation were performed on the study period. An overall nocturnal maximum in the mean accumulation of precipitation was detected during the 2-hour periods before 2000 LST and 2200 LST. Elevated spring and fall accumulations were responsible for this evening maximum. Elevated summer and winter accumulations were responsible for a weak secondary morning maximum. An overall morning maximum in the mean precipitation hours was detected during the 2-hour period before 1000 LST. ARIMA modeling verified that both precipitation accumulations and counts, for all times of the day, were significant at the 5% level. A storm event model was developed from the time series, the resulting values of which can be used as input in mesoscale climate, hydrological, and agricultural computer models: the mean pulse duration was 2.44 hours; the mean interlude between pulses was 37.64 hours; the mean event accumulation was 4.1 mm; and the mean rate was 1.8 mm/hr. Finally, inter-annual analysis performed for the period of 1981 to 1999 showed that there was no statistically significant change in precipitation over the period.																			0380-1330						2003	29	2					256	267		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70431-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70431-6													WOS:000183819000005

Quantifying the Spatial Structure of Invasive Lake Trout in Yellowstone Lake to Improve Suppression Efficacy	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Invasive Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush have altered the once-pristine Yellowstone Lake ecosystem through top-down effects by consuming Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri. To conserve Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and restore the ecosystem, a Lake Trout gillnetting program was implemented to suppress the invasive population. We evaluated the spatial structure of Lake Trout in Yellowstone Lake with the intent of increasing suppression efficiency. Specifically, we addressed questions related to adult Lake Trout aggregation and movement during summer and autumn (spawning) periods and how Lake Trout used locations in the context of suppression efforts. We tracked 373 Lake Trout (>500 mm TL) during the summer and autumn of 2016 and 2017. Based on kernel density estimates, Lake Trout were highly aggregated at 9 locations during summer and 22 locations during the spawning period. Using a novel metric, individual days (product of mean individuals per survey and mean length of stay), five summer locations and five spawning locations had at least 30 individual days. These locations are suggested as priority areas for targeting Lake Trout suppression. Lake Trout were less aggregated and moved less during the summer, making them less vulnerable to a passive gear in the summer than during the autumn spawning period. Lake Trout exhibited low spawning site fidelity compared to populations elsewhere, possibly due to decades of intensive gill netting at spawning locations. Given the aggregation and movement patterns observed in Yellowstone Lake, continuing to target adult Lake Trout during the spawning period is the most cost-effective approach to Lake Trout suppression.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the various gas-phase PCB sources, the spatial and temporal variability of PCB concentrations in the gas-phase that enter the Venice Lagoon atmosphere and the influence of the air temperature on PCB trends. The highest annual average concentration of Sigma PCBs was observed at the station directly influenced by "urban" sources with values about 3 and 1.5 times higher compared to the concentrations found at the stations where "marine" sources and "not subjected to direct local sources" were respectively sampled from. The temporal trends of Sigma PCBs concentrations were similar at the three sampling stations corresponding to seasonal temperature changes. Greater concentrations occurred in the summer and first autumn months while the lower ones occurred in late autumn and winter. The temperature dependences were investigated using plots of the natural logarithm of the Sigma PCBs concentrations vs. reciprocal mean temperatures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of Potential Overwinter Mortality of Age-0 Walleye and Appropriate Age-1 Sampling Gear	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Potential recruitment of age-0 Walleye Sander vitreus to adults is often indexed by the relative abundance of age-0 individuals during their first summer or fall. However, relationships between age-0 and adult Walleye abundance are often weak or nonsignificant in many waters. Overwinter mortality during the first year of life has been hypothesized as an important limitation to Walleye recruitment in lakes, but limited evidence of such mortality exists, likely due to difficulties in sampling age 1 Walleye during spring. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare results from nighttime electrofishing to index relative abundance of age-1 Walleyes with relative abundance indices of minifyke nets in four eastern South Dakota lakes; 2) determine whether size-selective mortality was occurring in those four lakes; and 3) if size-selective mortality was occurring in these lakes, determine whether that mortality was attributed to body condition. We sampled four natural lakes in eastern South Dakota 2 wk after ice-off in 2013 and 2014. Precision of nighttime electrofishing (coefficient of variation = 216.6) was greater than that estimated for minifyke nets (coefficient of variation 338.5) across both years. We detected no differences in length-frequency distributions of collected spring age-1 Walleye between the two gears. Age-0 fall relative abundance indices from electrofishing were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than spring age-1 nighttime electrofishing indices of relative abundance at three of the four study lakes, indicating that overwinter mortality may occur at a substantial rate during the first year of life for Walleye in these systems. Quantile-quantile regression plots showed evidence of size-selective mortality in three of four lakes sampled. However, body condition of age-0 Walleye appeared to have little to no influence on overwinter mortality. Instead, we suggest that smaller-sized walleye may be more vulnerable to overwinter predation. Collectively, these results provide evidence of previously hypothesized overwinter mortality within the first year for Walleye and indicate possibilities for indexing potential adult recruitment of Walleye just after this critical period.																			1944-687X					JUN	2018	9	1					65	74		10.3996/082017-JFWM-062	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/082017-JFWM-062													WOS:000434007200006

Direct measurements of dust fluxes from different landform types are useful in understanding the nature of dust emission and characterizing the dynamics of soil erodibility. In this study we used the PI-SWERL (R) instrument over a seasonal cycle to quantify the potential for PM10 (particles with diameter <= 10 mu m) emission from several typical landform types across the Tengger Desert and Mu Us Sandy Land, northern China. Our results indicate that sparse grasslands and coppice dunes showed relatively high emission potentials, with emitted fluxes ranging from 10(-1) to 10(1) mg m(-2) s(-1). These values were up to five times those emitted from sand dunes, and one to two orders of magnitude greater than the emissions from dry lake beds, stone pavements and dense grasslands. Generally, PM10 emission fluxes were seen to peak in the spring months, with significant reductions in summer and autumn (by up to 95%), and in winter (by up to 98%). Variations in soil moisture were likely a primary controlling factor responsible for this seasonality in PM10 emission. Our data provide a relative quantification of differences in dust emission potential from several key landform types. Such data allow for the evaluation of current dust source schemes proposed by prior researchers. Moreover, our data will allow improvements in properly characterizing the erodibility of dust source regions and hence refine the parameterization of dust emission in climate models.

J	Laudon, H				Laudon, H.			Recovery from episodic acidification delayed by drought and high sea salt deposition	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												For the prediction of episodic acidification large uncertainties are connected to climatic variability and its effect on drought conditions and sea-salt episodes. In this study data on 342 hydrological episodes in 25 Swedish streams, sampled over 10 years, have been analyzed using a recently developed episode model. The results demonstrate that drought is the most important factor modulating the magnitude of the anthropogenic influence on pH and ANC during episodes. These modulating effects are especially pronounced in southern and central Sweden, where the historically high acid deposition has resulted in significant S pools in catchment soils. The results also suggest that the effects of episodic acidification are becoming less severe in many streams, but this amelioration is less clear in coastal streams subject to high levels of sea-salt deposition. Concurrently with the amelioration of the effects of episodic acidification, regional climate models predict that temperatures will increase in Sweden during the coming decades, accompanied by reductions in summer precipitation and more frequent storms during fall and winter,in large areas of the country. If these predictions are realized delays in streams' recovery from episodic acidification events can be expected.

J	MCCLURE, HE				MCCLURE, HE			FACTORS IN WINTER STARVATION OF PHEASANTS	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Starvation of ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus col-chicus, in the National Wildlife Refuge, Valentine, Nebraska, in Mac, 1943, resulted from a combination of habitat factors extending over a period of yrs. The birds had been increasing in numbers during a period of drouth, 1938-1941, which extended marsh habitats by reducing lake surfaces and exposing more feeding area. Spring rains increased lake levels reducing the production of jewelweed (Impatiens nortonii), and inundating the hibernacula of March flies (Bibio sp.). A fall dry spell stifled the seed production of the sandhill sunflower (Helianthus petiolaris) and the basal shoots of blue grass (Poa pratensis). Seeds of a smartweed (Polygonum ramocissimum) were utilized by migrating birds in the fall. Heavy snowfall in March buried the emergency foods Russian thistle (Salsola pestifer), dandelion (Taraxacum sp.), clover (Melilotus sp.) and blue grass. At least 16% of the pheasant population starved.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1948	12	3					267	271																WOS:A1948XS08900008

As such, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine concentrations of circulating cortisol and thyroid hormones (THs; tT3, tT4) in 132 Yangtze finless porpoises (YFPs) located in Poyang Lake, (PL, n= 92) and Tian-E-ZhouOxbowreserve (TZO, n= 40). For overall hormone comparisons, animals were partitioned by age [juvenile and adult (male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female)], sex, season (winter or spring) and geographical location. Geographically, during winter, circulating THs were significantly higher in the PL versus TZO population. Seasonally, within PL, THs were significantly higher in the winter versus spring season. Animals were further binned into groups as follows: juvenile male (JM) and juvenile female (JF), adult male (AM), non-pregnant adult female, pregnant female and non-pregnant lactating female. Intra- group comparisons between locations showed a significant increase in JM THs at PL. Significant increases in THs during winter compared to spring were detected between JM and JF groups. Mean comparisons of cortisol within and between locations for each group identified a significant increase for TZO AM versus TZO pregnant female and JM and JF. Seasonally, in PL, only JF has significantly higher cortisol in winter versus spring. Finally, we established reference values of THs and cortisol for YFPs in different geographical locations. These references are important baselines from which the effects of environmental and biological variables on THs and cortisol may be evaluated.

It is necessary to investigate the effects of climatic variations (temperature and precipitation) on vegetation changes for a better understanding of acclimation to climatic change. In this paper, we focused on the integration and application of multi-methods and spatial analysis techniques in GIS to study the spatio-temporal variation of vegetation dynamics and to explore the vegetation change mechanism. The correlations between EVI and climate factors at different time scales were calculated for each pixel including monthly, seasonal and annual scales respectively in Qinghai Lake Basin from the year of 2001 to 2012. The primary objectives of this study are to reveal when, where and why the vegetation change so as to support better understanding of terrestrial response to global change as well as the useful information and techniques for wise regional ecosystem management practices. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Overall vegetation EVI in the region increased 6% during recent 12 years. The EVI value in growing seasons (i.e. spring and summer) exhibited very significant improving trend, accounted for 12.8% and 9.3% respectively. The spatial pattern of EVI showed obvious spatial heterogeneity which was consistent with hydrothermal condition. In general, the vegetation coverage improved in most parts of the area since nearly 78% pixel of the whole basin showed increasing trend, while degraded slightly in a small part of the area only. (2) The EVI change was positively correlated with average temperature and precipitation. Generally speaking, in Qinghai Lake Basin, precipitation was the dominant driving factor for vegetation growth; however, at different time scale its weight to vegetation has differences. (3) Based on geo-statistical analysis, the autumn precipitation has a strong correlation with the next spring EVI values in the whole region. This findings explore the autumn precipitation is an important indicator, and then, limits the plant growth of next spring.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				DEC	2014	24	6					1009	1021		10.1007/s11442-014-1134-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-014-1134-y													WOS:000343741900004

Daily mass changes in landbirds during migration stopover on the south shore of Lake Ontario	AUK												Assigning conservation priorities to areas used by birds during migration requires information on the relative quality of areas and habitats. The rate at which migratory birds replenish energy reserves during stopover may be used as an indicator of stopover-site quality. We estimated the rate of mass gain of 34 landbird species during stopover at a near-shore terrestrial site on the south shore of Lake Ontario in New York during 12 migration seasons from 1999 to 2004. The average rate of mass gain was estimated by relating a measure of condition to time of capture (hour after sunrise) with linear regression. Data from 25,385 captures were analyzed. Significantly positive rates of mass change were detected for 20 of 30 species during spring migration and 19 of 21 species during autumn migration. No significantly negative trends were detected in either season. Daily rates of mass gain across all species averaged 9.84% of average lean body weight during spring migration and 9.77% during autumn migration. Our regression estimates were significantly greater than estimates from traditional analyses that examine mass changes in recaptured birds. Analyses of mass changes in recaptured birds revealed a mean daily change of -0.68% of average lean mass in spring and 0.13% in autumn. Because of sampling biases inherent in recapture analyses, the regression approach is likely more accurate when the assumptions of the method are met. Similar studies in various habitats, landscapes, and regions are required to prioritize conservation efforts targeting migratory stages of the annual cycle.

Steep acetate concentration gradients were observed in the top cm when the sediment was analyzed at the millimeter scale. The gradients revealed not only the dynamic nature of the acetate pools but also indicated substantial mass transport between sediment layers. Acetate uptake could conveniently be modeled using first order reaction kinetics. Uptake rates ranged from 30 mu M day(-1) (winter) to 546 mu M day(-1) (early spring) in the sulfidogenic horizon (2 cm) and from 30 mu M day(-1) (winter) to 1176 mu M day(-1) (late summer) in the methanogenic horizon (5 cm). The integrated acetate uptake rate in the top 7 cm was 39.8 +/- 20 (2 X SE) mmol acetate m(-2) day(-1) during early spring. More than 40% of the total acetate pool was reversibly adsorbed in oxic sediment slurries. The presence of hydrous Fe(III) oxides appeared to determine the occurrence of acetate adsorption.																			0016-7037					JAN	1994	58	2					683	694		10.1016/0016-7037(94)90498-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90498-7													WOS:A1994MV54400012

In contrast, such correlations are absent for the Fayum region of Egypt where occupation instead correlates with mid-Holocene increases in intensity of Mediterranean winter rainfall. Lake Qarun in the Fayum was the only lake where Near Eastern plant domesticates were used during the early-mid-Holocene period. Analysis of radiocarbon determinations is presented which suggests that, unlike later agriculture in the Nile Valley, early use of domesticates in the Fayum involved a dependence on winter rains for cereal cultivation following the Mediterranean growth seasons. It is proposed that the switch to a winter growing season after summer inundation occurred later, probably as part of key socioeconomic changes during the Egyptian Predynastic period.

Habitat use, home range, movements and interactions of introduced Lepomis gibbosus and native Salmo trutta in a small stream of Southern England	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Radio telemetry data were analysed to assess the microhabitat use, movement patterns, home range overlap and interspecific interactions of non-native pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus (L.) and native brown trout Salmo trutta (L.) in a small English stream located immediately below a commercial angling lake from which pumpkinseed escaped. Although both species favoured pool habitats, brown trout preferred higher velocities and coarser substrata compared with pumpkinseed. Also, some individual brown trout preferred deeper waters than did pumpkinseed. Home range area of brown trout was substantially larger than that of pumpkinseed in spring and summer, and for both species, home range area in autumn was significantly smaller than in the other seasons. Range centre distribution analysis revealed that both species were distributed significantly nonrandomly within the stream during all seasons. There was substantial home range overlap between the two species in all seasons, the greatest being in spring. Overall distances moved were greatest during spring for both species, with brown trout moving greater distances relative to pumpkinseed. However, the absence of mutual attraction or avoidance between the species, as well as the lack of cohesion in preferred habitats and strong territorial fidelity, suggests little or no impact of introduced pumpkinseed on resident brown trout.

Long-term drivers of catch variability in south-eastern Australia?s largest portunid fishery	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Portunid crab fisheries are socially and economically valuable yet are characterised by high inter-annual vari-ability. Competing hypotheses about factors contributing to this variability concern the environment, climate, and fisher behaviour. Here, we investigate variability in commercial catch, through a case study of the most heavily exploited estuary in southeastern Australia (Wallis Lake). Four main hypotheses were identified based on the broader portunid published literature: 1) Freshwater flow may cause poor recruitment due to increased offshore spawning and unfavourable dispersal of larvae, 2) Winter and spring harvesting may impact the following summer harvest by removing the spawning stock biomass (recruit overfishing); 3) Environmental factors including sea surface temperature and onshore winds may influence supply-side processes and recruit-ment success, contributing to catch fluctuations; and 4) Climatic indices such as the Inter Pacific Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) may correlate with longer-term fluctuations in the fishery. We find evidence in support of hypotheses 2 and 4, with winter harvest negatively impacting the following January -April harvest and the PDO being positively correlated with January -April catch rates. Harvesting in June - November dis-proportionally impacts large females, and it may be possible to incorporate controls on winter fishing effort through co-management arrangements to achieve the best economic, environmental and social outcomes from the fishery. Such controls may lead to improved summer catch rates by protecting unspawned eggs during the winter months. The hypotheses explored here may provide insight in the variability observed in portunid fish-eries around the world.

Catfishes were sampled seasonally (1993-1996) using overnight, baited, multiple-hook trotlines fished in the main channel of the river (N = 276 sets) and in a 0.9-km long oxbow lake (N = 81 sets). Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and yellow bullhead Ameiurus natalis were the predominant species collected. Blue catfish I. furcatus and flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris catches were rare. Mean daily catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of channel catfish was higher in the main channel (1.0 fish/trotline-night) than in the oxbow lake (0.4 fish/trotline-night), whereas, yellow bullhead CPUE was lower in the main channel (0.1 fish/trotline-night) than in the oxbow lake (1.6 fish/trotline-night). Channel catfish CPUE was highest during spring and lowest during fall, whereas, yellow bullhead CPUE was highest during winter. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water transparency tended to be similar between habitats, except summer water temperature that was higher in the oxbow lake than in the river. Variability of the physical parameters tended to be greater in the oxbow lake. Opportunities to promote and enhance fisheries resources in small floodplain-river backwaters should not be overlooked.																			0892-2284		1-888569-19-0				1999	24						215	222																WOS:000086864000018
J	HART, RC				HART, RC			EQUIPROPORTIONAL TEMPERATURE-DURATION RESPONSES AND THERMAL INFLUENCES ON DISTRIBUTION AND SPECIES SWITCHING IN THE COPEPODS METADIAPTOMUS-MERIDIANUS AND TROPODIAPTOMUS-SPECTABILIS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The temperature-dependence of development was studied in two ecologically divergent freshwater calanoids, Metadiaptomus meridianus (Douwe) and Tropodiaptomus spectabilis (Kiefer). Egg durations were determined between 10 and 35 degrees C, and food satiated post-embryonic development times between 12 and 32 degrees C. All responses were basically inverse monotonic functions of temperature, adequately described by Belehradek's equation. M. meridianus generally developed faster than T. spectabilis. Its egg development was faster at all temperatures, and while its naupliar durations were shorter only up to +/- 15 degrees C, its overall post-embryonic development was more rapid up to +/- 24 degrees C in females and +/- 28 degrees C in males. Relatively speaking, however, T. spectabilis is clearly more warm-adapted than M. meridianus. The respective distributions (warm subtropical lowlands vs cooler uplands) of these copepods in the southern African subcontinent, as well as reversible switches between these species observed in two Natal impoundments are consistent with their contrasting thermal responses, although additional considerations apply in respect of the species alternations. T. spectabilis was replaced by M. meridianus in L. Midmar in spring 1981 and 1989, and in L. Albert Falls in spring 1990. Reciprocal replacements occurred in Midmar in autumn 1984, and in Albert Falls in late summer 1991. Both spring switches in Midmar coincided with cool spring temperatures, although the consequent Shifts in growth rate advantage predicted from the measured temperature-duration responses only partly explain the switches in this warm-temperate reservoir. Parasitism of T. spectabilis by an ellobiopsid was observed during both switching events in Midmar, and perhaps augmented the change, although its effects on the host are indeterminate. Both species showed exactly parallel temporal changes in fecundity during the recent switches in both reservoirs, indicating closely similar trophic niches in the adults at least, and mitigating the possibility of trophic influences as determinants of the replacement. A dramatic but inexplicable increase (around 50% at 20 degrees C) in the development time of T. spectabilis was noted between 1988 and 1990, and perhaps contributed too. The protracted historical dominance of T. spectabilis in thermally suboptimal conditions in Midmar is ascribed to a general competitive superiority presumed from its K-selected attributes, in contrast to the r-selection evident in M. meridianus. This alternation between species with contrasting life styles is of fundamental ecological interest. Studies on Albert Falls, commenced in 1989, suggest an even greater competitive superiority of T. spectabilis, in keeping with the warmer conditions in this larger sister reservoir below Midmar. Overall, the species switches are intelligible largely as integrated manifestations of contrasting fecundity, temperature-dependent development, seasonality attributes and competitive ability, and parasite susceptibility of these copepods in habitats which tend to be marginal, especially for T. spectabilis in Midmar. Equiproportional development is apparent in these taxa. The implications of this apparently general feature to the estimation of copepod production is considered briefly with particular reference to warm and tropical waters.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 7	1994	272	1-3					163	183		10.1007/BF00006519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006519													WOS:A1994MV62000013
J	Lv, YB; Zhang, M; Yin, HB				Lv, Yaobin; Zhang, Man; Yin, Hongbin			Phosphorus release from the sediment of a drinking water reservoir under the influence of seasonal hypoxia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Seasonal sediment internal phosphorus (P) release may cause water eutrophication and impair water quality in drinking water reservoir. During a year-long field investigation, the effects of the microenvironment on the release of internal phosphorus were meticulously analyzed using high -resolution peepers technique and microelectrode system. The release mechanisms of P fractions from the reservoir sediments were also explored. The results showed that seasonal fluctuations in temperature, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and pH at the sediment -water interface impacted the release of P fractions from the studied reservoir sediment. Higher diffusive fluxes of soluble reactive PO43  and Fe2+ across the sediment -water interface (SWI) were observed in the warmer season and were approximately 14.5 times and 16.5 times than those in winter, respectively. Driven by seasonal hypoxia, the reservoir sediment functioned as a P sink in winter and became a P source in summer and autumn. The reduction of Fe-bound P and mineralization of organic P were the primary mechanisms driving sediment P release, which explains the increased P flux in the warmer season and lower P flux in winter. The findings indicated that elevated temperatures and anaerobic conditions were conducive to the activation of P in sediments, whereas lower temperatures and aerobic conditions promoted the immobilization of P. This study provided new insights into seasonal P cycling in reservoirs that can contribute to the formulation of targeted reservoir management strategies.

Previous studies on the microalgae in reservoir have mainly focused on the spatio-temporal patterns of surface microalgae communities at the horizontal scale, while few studies have simultaneously considered the successions of microalgae in vertical profiles including the sediments and the effects of the nutrients release and microalgae in sediments on microalgae in upper waters.

The seasonal variations in microalgae compositions decreased gradually from the surface water (the dominance of Cryptophyta and Chlorophyta in spring, Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta in summer, and relatively uniform in autumn and winter) to the sediment (the dominance of Bacillariophyta throughout the year), which was influenced by the variations of physico-chemical factors in different layers. The spatio-temporal variations in microalgae communities in waters was attributing to not only the heterogeneities of the stratification, and the physico-chemical factors such as water temperature, pH, and nutrient concentrations, especially for phosphorus in the water column, but also the combinations of phosphorus release and microalgae composition in sediments. Environmental changes would be especially problematic for microalgae groups such as Cryptophyta, Dinophyta and Chlorophyta that were sensitive to the changes of temperature and nutrients. Our results are helpful for an extensive understanding of the dynamics of microalgae communities in reservoir, and contribute to reservoir management for ensuring the safety of drinking water.

J	Stager, JC; Wiltse, B; Murphy, S				Stager, J. Curt; Wiltse, Brendan; Murphy, Skylar			Once and future changes in climate and phenology within the Adirondack uplands (New York, USA)	PLOS CLIMATE												Long-term monitoring of the spring and autumn phenology of five animal species, four plant species, phytoplankton communities, lake temperatures and ice cover on the Paul Smith's College Phenology Trail in the uplands of the Adirondack State Park (NY, USA) has produced time series spanning 1990-2020 for the biological and water temperature records and 1909-2020 for lake ice. In conjunction with climate records from three nearby weather stations these observations demonstrate that the ice on Lower Saint Regis Lake now thaws one week earlier, on average, than it did in 1909 while the region as a whole warmed by 1.7 degrees C and received 19 cm more precipitation annually. Statistically significant warming trends between 1990 and 2020 were restricted to July and September and therefore contributed to a scarcity of temporal shifts in the spring phenologies of species and lake ice during that shorter time frame, but the lake surface warmed by 1.9 degrees C on average in October. Although most of the phenological records displayed no statistically significant directional change within the 1990-2020 time interval they revealed strong correlations between phenology and monthly air temperatures that are of predictive value. Together with projections from regionally down-scaled climate models these relationships suggest that the phenologies of the species and ice dynamics in question could shift by ca. 1-3 weeks by 2100 depending on the analytical approach used and the magnitude of fossil fuel emissions during this century. As Adirondack winters become shorter and milder before potentially losing snow and ice altogether over the longer term, the unique cultural ecology of the region's human residents will face profound existential challenges along with the ecosystems and species around them.																				2767-3200					2022	1	9							e0000047	10.1371/journal.pclm.0000047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000047													WOS:001408656800001

Temporal changes in the viromes of Swedish Varroa-resistant and Varroa-susceptible honeybee populations	PLOS ONE												The parasitic mite, Varroa destructor, in combination with the viruses it vectors, is the main cause for global colony losses of the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. However, an isolated honeybee population established in 1999 on the Island of Gotland, Sweden has naturally acquired resistance to the mite, and has survived without mite control treatment for more than 18 years. A recent study has shown that this mite resistant (MR) population also appears to be resistant to Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Sacbrood virus (SBV) and tolerant to Deformed wing virus (DWV), relative to nearby mite susceptible (MS) honeybee populations. In this study, RNA sequencing was employed to corroborate these previous findings and identify other viral factors that may play a role in the enhanced survival of this mite resistant honeybee population. Two additional honeybee-infecting viruses, Apis rhabdovirus-1 (ARV-1) and Lake Sinai virus (LSV), were identified and near-complete genomes of these two viruses were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses of the assembled virus sequences revealed consistent separation between the MR and MS honeybee populations, although it is unclear whether this is due to pre-existing differences between the viruses in the two populations when they were established, and isolated, or due to virus genetic adaptation towards reduced virulence in the MR population, to promote colony survival. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) analyses show higher ARV and LSV titres in MS colonies compared to MR colonies, gradually increasing from summer to autumn 2009, and reaching maximum titres in the following spring 2010. While the DWV and BQCV titres in MR colonies increased between autumn 2009 and spring 2010, the SBV practically disappeared entirely by spring 2010. Possible explanations for the apparent virus tolerance or resistance in the Gotland mite-resistant honeybee population are discussed.

Here we present a reconstruction of changes in the regime of the Nile River during the Holocene obtained using bulk elemental composition, grain-size analyses and radiogenic strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) isotopes from a sediment core collected on the Nile deep-sea fan. This 6-m long core was retrieved at similar to 700 m water-depth and is characterized by the presence of a 5-m thick section of finely laminated sediments, which were deposited between 9.5 and 7.3 ka BP and correspond to the African Humid Period (AHP). The data show distinct changes in eolian dust inputs as well as variations in discharge of the Blue Nile and White Nile. Sedimentation was mainly controlled by changes in fluvial discharge during the Holocene, which was predominantly forced by low-latitude summer insolation and by the location of the eastern African Rain Belt. The changes in relative contribution from the Blue Nile and White Nile followed changes in low-latitude spring/autumn insolation, which highlights the role of changes in seasonality of the precipitation on the Nile River regime. The relative intensity of the Blue Nile discharge was enhanced during the early and late Holocene at times of higher spring insolation (with massive erosion and runoff during the AHP at times of high summer insolation), while it was reduced between 8 and 4 ka at times of high autumn insolation. The gradual insolation-paced changes in fluvial regime were interrupted by a short-term arid event at 8.5-7.3 ka BP (also associated with rejuvenation of bottom-water ventilation above the Nile fan), which was likely related to northern hemisphere cooling events. Another arid event at 4.5-3.7 ka BP occurred as the apex of a gradually drier phase in NE Africa and marks the end of the AHP. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	FORSBERG, BR				FORSBERG, BR			THE FATE OF PLANKTONIC PRIMARY PRODUCTION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The C dynamics of phytoplankton communicates in 6 different lakes were investigated. In each lake C-specific rates of production (b) and loss (d) were highly correlated and closely balanced through most of the year. As a result C-specific growth rates were usually very low and C standing crop was relatively stable between sampling dates. Major fluctuations in algal biomass occurred only when the production-loss balance was significantly perturbed. The frequency of these perturbations and the seasonal variability of b and d differed between lakes. The most consistent pattern was found in the low altitude lakes of the temperate zone, where b and d were highest in summer and lowest in winter. Values were also low during the spring and fall mixing periods when perturbations in the production-loss balance caused major peaks in C standing crop. The fate of primary production varied significantly between lakes. In most of the lakes considered the majority of C fixation was consumed in metabolic processes. However, in Lake Wingra [Wisconsin, USA] a large part of the production was apparently lost through grazing and sedimentation. Differences in the average values of b, d, and % metabolic loss between lakes appeared to depend on the combined loss rate due to sinking and grazing. These results suggest a general pattern of C dynamics similar to that found in steady state continuous cultures.					; forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020	forsberg, bruce/0000-0001-7606-0585; 													0024-3590	1939-5590					1985	30	4					807	819		10.4319/lo.1985.30.4.0807	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1985.30.4.0807													WOS:A1985APJ9400008

Spatial and temporal trends in the data indicate distinct and persistent increases in water clarity in the inner bay after the first large recruitment of zebra mussels in the fall of 1991. The pre-Dreissena imagery show that turbidity in the inner bay was influenced by the Saginaw River discharge in spring, biological production (plankton) in summer, and wind-driven resuspension in fall, with highest turbidity in spring and fall. Spatial patterns in the post-Dreissena images were more similar regardless of season, with low reflectances in the shallow regions of the inner bay where zebra mussel densities were highest. A regression model based on point data from 24 sampling stations over the 7-yr period indicates that reflectances varied significantly by site and zebra mussel densities, as well as seasonally. Trends in observed and predicted values of reflectances followed similar patterns at each station-highest values were found during 1991 and lowest during 1992 at all stations, with slightly higher R(rs) in 1993 compared to 1992. Whereas AVHRR R(rs) highlight the value of historical imagery for reconstructing seasonal and interannual turbidity patterns in near-shore waters, a new generation of operational ocean color satellites, such as SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) and the newly launched MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer), now provide for routine monitoring of important biological and physical processes from space.

J	WALKER, MJC; COOPE, GR; LOWE, JJ				WALKER, MJC; COOPE, GR; LOWE, JJ			THE DEVENSIAN (WEICHSELIAN) LATE-GLACIAL PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECORD FROM GRANSMOOR, EAST YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Palynological and coleopteran data are described from a section through Late Devensian (Weichselian) deposits at Gransmoor, East Yorkshire, England. The pollen evidence shows that, following an initial open-habitat episode, first Juniperus scrub and later Betula woodland became established in the area during the Lateglacial Interstadial. This woodland was replaced during the Loch Lomond (Younger Dryas) Stadial by a predominantly herbaceous flora with arctic/alpine, steppe and halophytic elements. The coleopteran evidence indicates a similar local environment and that the thermal maximum of the Interstadial, when mean July temperatures may well have exceeded 18-degrees-C, occurred prior to the deposition of die earliest polleniferous sediments. By the time of the Juniperus expansion, summer temperatures had fallen by 2-4-degrees-C to levels comparable with those of the present day. A further temperature decline followed the expansion of Betula during the later Interstadial and another fall occurred at the Lateglacial Interstadial/Loch Lomond Stadial boundary. During the Loch Lomond Stadial mean July temperatures of 9-11-degrees-C are implied, with winter temperatures as low as -15 to -20-degrees-C. Collectively the evidence reemphasises the point that for the first 1000 years or so of the Lateglacial Interstadial, there was a disequilibrium between the palynological and coleopteran records in terms of climatic signal. During the later Interstadial, however, a closer relationship is apparent between both proxy data sources. Of particular significance in this respect is the fluctuation in reconstructed summer and winter temperatures, and a rise and subsequent fall in Betula pollen frequencies. This may be the correlative of one of the pre-Younger Dryas climatic oscillations recorded in other proxy data sources including palynological records from Britain and eastern Canada, oxygen isotope traces from Swiss lake sediments, isotopic and electrical conductivity profiles from the Greenland ice sheet, and diatom and foraminiferal records in cores from the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean.																			0277-3791						1993	12	8					659	680		10.1016/0277-3791(93)90006-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(93)90006-8													WOS:A1993NW63200006

Hydroclimate influences ice jam dynamics in southern Quebec watersheds through competing effects on ice cover resistance and dislocation forces	NATURAL HAZARDS												Climate change impacts river ice phenomena, influencing ice jam regimes. The complex formation of ice jams, which depends on a combination of morphological and hydrometeorological conditions, varies interannually and between watersheds. This research aims to identify the hydroclimatic conditions, associated with the balance between resisting and dislocating forces exerted on ice, that influence the spatiotemporal variability of seasonal ice jams in ten watersheds in southern Quebec, Canada. Generalized additive mixed-effects models were used to quantify the effect of potential hydroclimatic predictors on winter and spring number of ice jams at the watershed scale during the 2005-2018 period. Winter ice jams were not frequent (n = 114) and occurred only in a few locations. A higher number of winter ice jams was found to be associated with extreme seasonal hydroclimatic conditions, including higher peak rainfall or streamflow that dislocated the ice, while the role of snowfall remains uncertain in winter. The spring breakup favors a higher number of ice jams (n = 219), particularly in conjunction with high peak flows and sustained rainfall. The number of spring ice jams also increased in response to higher antecedent winter snowfall, hinting at the importance of white ice as a mechanism for the growth of river ice cover. In spring, hydroclimatic predictors alone offered greater explanatory potential (deviance explained = 34.5%) than in winter (deviance explained = < 10%), for which the few occurrences and limited data did not allow strong relationships to be identified. In an ever-changing hydroclimatic regime driven by climate change, this knowledge increases our capacity to predict ice dynamics in jam-prone fluvial systems.					; Kinnard, Christophe/AAI-2468-2020	Arsenault, Lisane/0000-0001-7221-7661; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				APR	2025	121	6					7649	7681		10.1007/s11069-024-07078-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-024-07078-y		JAN 2025											WOS:001394574900001

Fish were sampled in several locations at night with large beach seines during spring, summer and fall of 1995-1998. Long-term changes were inferred from comparison with a similar study conducted over 70 y earlier in Spirit Lake. We found 26 species in the littoral zone. The number of species per sample ranged from 4 to 18, aver-aging 11.8. The average number of species per sample was higher at stations with greater vegetation density. A distinct seasonal pattern was evident in the number of species collected per sample in most years, increasing steadily from spring to fall. Patterns of variability within our 1995-1998 study period suggest that: (1) numerous samples are necessary to adequately characterize a littoral fish community, (2) sampling should be done when vegetation and young-of-year densities are highest and (3) sampling during a single, year is inadequate to reveal the full community. The number of native species has declined by approximately 25% over the last 70 y. A coincident decline in littoral vegetation and associated habitat changes during the same period are likely causes of the long-term community change.																			0003-0031					OCT	2001	146	2					290	299		10.1674/0003-0031(2001)146[0290:STVALT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2001)146[0290:STVALT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000171342200006

Dense macrobenthos and algal blooms form in the lake during summer and autumn. High primary production and chlorophyll-a concentrations were measured in April and during the summer of 1997. Fresh organic matter in the sediments from the degradation and decomposition of the blooms together with high sulfate concentrations, allowed microbial sulfate reduction to occur. Sediment cores taken from different sites (peat and marl) during various seasons in 1997, showed high sulfate reduction rates in June in the marl region, and September in the peat region (842 and 2834 nmol SO42- reduced ml(-1) day(-1), respectively). In February, corresponding to the development and decline of macrophytes and algal blooms, lower rates of sulfate: reduction were recorded (11 nmol SO42- reduced ml(-1) day(-1)). Sulfate reduction is limited by the supply of organic matter and is one of the major processes contributing to the mineralization of organic matter in this lake. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Increase of urban lake salinity by road deicing salt	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Over 317,000 tonnes of road salt (NaCl) are applied annually for road deicing in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) of Minnesota. Although road salt is applied to increase driving safety, this practice influences environmental water quality. Thirteen lakes in the TCMA were studied over 46 months to determine if and how they respond to the seasonal applications of road salt. Sodium and chloride concentrations in these lakes were 10 and 25 times higher, respectively, than in other non-urban lakes in the region. Seasonal salinity/chloride cycles in the lakes were correlated with road salt applications: High concentrations in the winter and spring, especially near the bottom of the lakes, were followed by lower concentrations in the summer and fall due to flushing of the lakes by rainfall runoff. The seasonal salt storage/flushing rates for individual lakes were derived from volume-weighted average chloride concentration time series. The rate ranged from 9 to 55% of a lake's minimum salt content. In some of the lakes studied salt concentrations were high enough to stop spring turnover preventing oxygen from reaching the benthic sediments. Concentrations above the sediments were also high enough to induce convective mixing of the saline water into the sediment pore water. A regional analysis of historical water quality records of 38 lakes in the TCMA showed increases in lake salinity from 1984 to 2005 that were highly correlated with the amount of rock salt purchased by the State of Minnesota. Chloride concentrations in individual lakes were positively correlated with the percent of impervious surfaces in the watershed and inversely with lake volume. Taken together, the results show a continuing degradation of the water quality of urban lakes due to application of NaCl in their watersheds. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a conceptual framework was used to investigate groundwater behaviors and associated hydrological exchanges by combining field measurements, digital filtering and analytical approaches, exemplified by a linked catchment-floodplain-lake system (Poyang Lake, China). The results show that the hydrological regime for both groundwater and surface water exhibit a seasonal variability in the lake catchment. Topographically, the lake catchment can be divided into the mountainous baseflow, ungauged lateral groundwater and floodplain groundwater that contribute to the lake storage changes. Although groundwater flow is generally from the mountainous catchment to the lake floodplain areas due to topographic effects, precipitation provides an additional input for the shallow groundwater and is expected to enhance the groundwater dynamics in terms of spatially heterogeneous responses. The estimation indicates that about 40 % of the catchment river discharge may be coming from the mountainous baseflow (-290 x 10(8) m(3)/yr) and discharged into the lake through a surface flow pathway. The ungauged groundwater-lake interaction shows the annual discharge volume is up to 10 x 108 m(3)/yr and associated exchange fluxes tend to be stronger during spring-summer months (23-45 m(3)/s) than those of autumn-winter months (9-22 m(3)/s). Additionally, the floodplain groundwater-lake exchange (-9.5 x 108 m(3)/yr) indicates that groundwater generally receives the lake water during summer months (mean flux = 110 m(3)/s) and discharges into the lake during other months (90 m(3)/s) through a subsurface pathway. This study highlights the importance of groundwater's contributions to the surface river-lake system in terms of the flux variability and different transport pathways. The outcomes of this work will benefit future water resources management and applications by providing a methodology for predicting the groundwater hydrology of large lake-catchment systems.					; Liu, Bo/M-1151-2015	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 20	2022	853								158558	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158558	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158558		SEP 2022						36087659					WOS:000861103400010

A water quality profile, in both of spatial and temporal variations, plays a very important role in assessment and management of lake water quality. In order to have deeply understanding of the lake water quality parameters, some observation plans were decided for the Shikinawa Lake, in different climate conditions including summer, typhoon occurring time, end of autumn, and before spring. Results of the first observation, which have done in summer, are presented and discussed in this paper. Some important properties of water quality situation of the Shikinawa Lake were obtained and analyzed. Measured data also gave a clearly understanding of relationship among water quality parameters, effects of climate condition and aquatic plant coverage on lake water quality distribution. Besides, periods of activities of convection term and wind induction on water quality were cleared from analyzed data.

Methods A total of 96 sediment and seawater samples were collected from 16 sampling stations during the spring, summer, autumn, and winter of 2017. Then, the concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Fe were determined. Finally, the pollution load index (PLI), ecological risk (Er), and environmental risk (RI) were calculated to assess the HM ecological risk. Results The results showed that the mean concentrations of HMs were lower than the maximum acceptable concentration by SQG and NOAA. In addition, the PLI assessed a low pollution load level in the region. The ER and RI results also showed that the region was at low risk, and the metal risk was classified as Cd > Cu > Pb > Ni > Zn > Cr. In some samples, the mean concentrations of HM were found to be higher with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). The results also showed that sediments were engaging in a moderate Er by Cd. Conclusions Generally, the rapid growth of urbanization, as well as industrial and human activities, along this coastline and area has increased the pollutants dumped into the seawater and sediments. Thus, it is necessary to take regular monitoring programs and develop better management strategies to minimize the amount of HMs entering into this coastal area.

A total number of 16 potentially toxic dinoflagellates were identified. Density of each species was analyzed in time and space and in relation to environmental parameters. Some species such as Alexandrium catenella, A. pseudogonyaulax, A. tamarense, Dinophysis sacculus, Prorocentrum lima, P. minimum and Gonyaulax spinifera developed high cell concentrations, particularly during spring and summer seasons. Other species such as A. insuetum, A. lee, A. minutum, Coolia monotis, D. acuminata, D. caudata, D. fortii, Ostreopsis siamensis and P. concavum were detected in this coastal ecosystem, but they were rare or appeared in very low densities. Densities of the most abundant species were closely associated with spring and summer conditions, being positively correlated with water temperature and salinity. These species performed well in this lagoon, but the specific species-dependent affinity to each of the environment factors determined which organisms proliferated. The spatial distribution of the abundant species exhibited a marked increase towards the western and southern parts of the lagoon represented by sites C, D and E. Examination of the temporal distribution revealed that the species more prone to bloom are those with extensive spatial distribution and frequent presence throughout the year such as D. sacculus. Statistical analysis of D. sacculus density dynamics showed a significant difference between summer and winter assemblages. It presented a positive correlation with water temperature and salinity, but it seems to be tolerant to all levels of nutrients.																			1730-413X	1897-3191				DEC	2012	41	4					25	35		10.2478/s13545-012-0036-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13545-012-0036-9													WOS:000310753000004

Large-ensemble simulations show that warming drives distinct seasonal changes: in winter, an intensified ridge over the western U.S. enhances moisture transport to Alaska, increasing precipitation while promoting vegetation growth near the Alaska Range. In summer, rising temperatures intensify the fire weather index signaling greater wildfire potential and increase lightning activity. Although the links among these complex seasonal changes remain difficult to validate, temporal overlap-enhanced vegetation growth followed by more fire-conducive weather, and associated increase in lightning could collectively heighten wildfire risk. The robustness of our large-ensemble simulations provides compelling evidence for these cascading effects. Extreme lightning-driven events, such as the Swan Lake Fire, represent the emerging pattern in Alaska's evolving fire regime. The concurrent rise in winter wetness and summer fire conditions underscore the urgent need for adaptive fire management strategies that address these interconnected climate drivers.

To address the challenge of conservation, many endangered wildlife are kept in captive or semi-captive conditions. Numerous studies have been conducted on the intestinal microbiota of captive animals, but little information is available on the intestinal microbiota of semi-captive animals, such as Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii), which is an endangered ungulate species only distributed around Qinghai Lake in China. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing methods to analyze the gut bacterial community of semi-captive Przewalski's gazelles during summer and winter. There were differences in the gut bacterial community composition between the 2 seasons, with higher bacterial diversity in winter. Deterministic processes dominated the bacterial community assembly in both seasons. There was a greater influence of heterogeneous selection in winter compared to summer, suggesting that there was more intestinal environmental filtering and selection on shaping the gut bacterial community during winter. There were more potential probiotic bacteria and fewer potential pathogens in winter compared to summer. Overall, stronger heterogeneous selection in winter might enhance gut selection for potential probiotic bacteria and filter out potential pathogens in Przewalski's gazelles, allowing them to adapt to the harsh living conditions in winter. Our study clarified that seasonal fluctuations trigger shifts in bacterial communities, which have potential benefits for Przewalski's gazelles. These results could provide valuable information for managing semi-captive populations and for future wild releases of Przewalski's gazelles.					wang, xin/JDW-8608-2023; li, chunlin/KFS-0761-2024; Wu, Yuannuo/ISS-7259-2023														0022-541X	1937-2817				APR	2024	88	3								10.1002/jwmg.22545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22545		JAN 2024											WOS:001147444500001

The effect of metal pollution was evaluated using some biochemical markers [glutathione-S-transferase (GST), acetylcolinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione reductase (GR), metallothionein (MT)] in the digestive gland of the mussels. Mussels were collected from four sampling sites of dam lake in the winter and summer of 2016. The metal levels in the mussel samples varied significantly across the sites and seasons (p < 0.05). Fe was the most accumulated metal, followed by Zn, Cu, and As, while Hg was the least accumulated metal. There were significant differences among sites and between seasons for enzyme activities and MT levels (p < 0.05). Although AChE was inhibited in summer at all sites, the lowest level of AChE was determined for the Sitilce site. Our results showed that there were statistical differences for CaE, GR, and GST activities among sites and between seasons. MT levels were statistically higher in summer than in winter at all sites (p < 0.05). The highest MT level was detected at the Sarisu site in summer, while the lowest MT level was detected at Sitilce in winter. According to the results of correlation analysis, we observed strong correlations between MT and some metal concentrations in both winter and summer (p < 0.05). Our data suggest that industrial activities and domestic wastes along the coast of Ataturk Dam Lake are the main sources of metal pollutants at these sites.

J	KORTHALS, ET; WINFREY, MR				KORTHALS, ET; WINFREY, MR			SEASONAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN MERCURY METHYLATION AND DEMETHYLATION IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microbial mercury methylation and methylmercury decomposition were examined in Lake Clara, an oligotrophic northern Wisconsin seepage lake, using radioisotopic tracers. Methylation activity was near background in the water column, was greatest in the profundal surficial sediments, and decreased with depth in sediment cores. Active demethylation occurred in the water column but was variable. Demethylation was greatest in the surficial sediments and decreased slightly with sediment depth. The methylation/demethylation ratio (M/D) was > 1 in the water column, exhibited a sharp peak in surface sediments, and decreased in deeper sediments. Methylation and demethylation activity varied in surface sediments collected along a lake transect. The M/D ratio in surface sediments ranged from 1.4 to 5.8. Methylation in attached microbial communities was near background, while demethylation was high. The M/D ratios in the attached communities were all < 0.20. Methylation activity in surface sediments incubated at in situ temperature increased from spring to late summer and decreased in the fall. Demethylation increased from early to midsummer and then declined. The M/D ratio in surface sediments increased from mid- to late summer, and decreased in the fall. These results indicate that the greatest potential for methylation in Lake Clara occurs in the surficial sediments and that methylation in surficial sediments is greatest from mid-July through September. In addition, the net rate of methylmercury production may be significantly affected by demethylation.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				OCT	1987	53	10					2397	2404		10.1128/AEM.53.10.2397-2404.1987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.53.10.2397-2404.1987								16347460					WOS:A1987K354800021

Stopover duration of spring migrating dabbling ducks in the Wabash river valley	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Waterfowl use stopover sites during spring migration to rest and replenish nutrient reserves prior to their arrival on breeding grounds. Estimating the extent to which an individual remains at a stopover site before dispersing (i.e., stopover duration) is essential for managers to develop wetland habitat objectives needed to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the needs of migrating waterfowl. Our objectives were to determine average stopover duration of dabbling ducks in the Wabash River Valley (WRV) of Illinois and Indiana, USA, identify factors that may influence that duration, and evaluate how those duration values compare with those currently used by the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture (UMRGLRJV). We estimated stopover duration of 39 mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and 62 green-winged teal (A. crecca) between January and April 2016-2017 in the WRV. Estimated stopover duration for mallards and green-winged teal was 17.0 days (95% CI = 12.6-22.9). Our estimate is substantially shorter than current estimates used by the UMRGLRJV for conservation planning and could affect conservation objectives for waterfowl. (c) 2019 The Wildlife Society.

The more abundant species were Fulica leucoptera, Larus maculipennis, Phoenicopterus chilensis, Plegadis chihi, Anas platalea, Himantopus mexicanus, and Rollandia rolland. Bird abundance was similar in winter and summer, whereas species composition differed between seasons. We recorded 65 species in summer and 59 in winter. P. chilensis and A. sibilatrix were more abundant in winter, whereas Ajaia ajaja, Phalacrocorax olivaceus, Ardea ibis, Sterna nilotica, Egretta thula, Mycteria americana, Charadrius collaris, A. versicolor, Calidris fuscicollis, and Ciconia maguari were more abundant in summer. Bird abundance in each survey was positively associated with the lake level. In summer surveys, the highest variation in species composition through the years was associated with water level fluctuations. Shorebirds predominated in those years with lower level, whereas the species that fed mainly on plants or vertebrates predominated in years with higher levels. Those species that fed on invertebrates (not shorebirds) and those that fed on invertebrates and plants predominated in years with intermediate level. The omnivorous species predominated in years of lower level. There were differences among transects in the proportion of different trophic groups. Short-term studies that do not take into account the particular dynamic of these systems may lead to erroneous generalisations. Thus, the long-term information of this study may be useful for management and conservation of species and system.

While several comprehensive paleotemperature reconstructions have been developed across Europe, only a few quantitative high-resolution studies exist for precipitation. Here we present a calibration and verification study of lithoclastic sediment proxies from proglacial Lake Oeschinen (46A degrees 30'N, 7A degrees 44'E, 1,580 m a.s.l., north-west Swiss Alps) that are sensitive to rainfall for the period AD 1901-2008. We collected two sediment cores, one in 2007 and another in 2011. The sediments are characterized by two facies: (A) mm-laminated clastic varves and (B) turbidites. The annual character of the laminae couplets was confirmed by radiometric dating (Pb-210, Cs-137) and independent flood-layer chronomarkers. Individual varves consist of a dark sand-size spring-summer layer enriched in siliciclastic minerals and a lighter clay-size calcite-rich winter layer. Three subtypes of varves are distinguished: Type I with a 1-1.5 mm fining upward sequence; Type II with a distinct fine-sand base up to 3 mm thick; and Type III containing multiple internal microlaminae caused by individual summer rainstorm deposits. Delta-fan surface samples and sediment trap data fingerprint different sediment source areas and transport processes from the watershed and confirm the instant response of sediment flux to rainfall and erosion. Based on a highly accurate, precise and reproducible chronology, we demonstrate that sediment accumulation (varve thickness) is a quantitative predictor for cumulative boreal alpine spring (May-June) and spring/summer (May-August) rainfall (r(MJ) = 0.71, r(MJJA) = 0.60, p < 0.01). Bootstrap-based verification of the calibration model reveals a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEPMJ = 32.7 mm, RMSEPMJJA = 57.8 mm) which is on the order of 10-13 % of mean MJ and MJJA cumulative precipitation, respectively. These results highlight the potential of the Lake Oeschinen sediments for high-resolution reconstructions of past rainfall conditions in the northern Swiss Alps, central and eastern France and south-west Germany.

Using an experimental heating facility we investigated the responses of three-week growth of two submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton crispus Linn. and Elodea canadensis Michx.), and periphyton on these plants and their artificial mimics. Analysis was based on IPCC climate scenarios A2 (ca. + 3 degrees C) and A2 + 50% (called A3 in our study) relative to ambient conditions, across warming in spring and early summer (summer showed higher nitrogen loading). Some functional traits of plants showed species-specific responses to warming: A3 promoted the growth of E. canadensis in both seasons, while for P. crispus warming reduced the leaf number in spring but enhanced the turion production in early summer. Periphyton biomass was lower in A3 in early summer, but not in spring. Our results further show that the growth of E. canadensis and the asexual reproduction of P. crispus might increase in a warmer future. Moreover, we found a complex response of periphyton to the temperature increase and substrate type, varying with season and nutrient state.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Aznarez, Celina/KSL-9758-2024	Pacheco Esnal, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-8100-2635; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Liu, Yang/0000-0001-6208-7285; Aznarez, Celina/0000-0001-7807-1413													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2021	848	6					1333	1346		10.1007/s10750-021-04530-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04530-z		FEB 2021											WOS:000620450200002

This paper presents data generated from the first 3 years of the monitoring program, discusses how the data are being used to establish and justify lake restoration targets, and assesses how water quality conditions have changed over time. Between 1972 and 2005, lake-wide averages of total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus from the water surface have declined from 68 to 27 mu g/L and from 20 to 5 mu g/L, respectively. In addition, average chlorophyll a concentrations have declined from 25 to 6 mu g/L over this period, while Secchi disk depths have increased from 1.5 to 2.2 m. Wastewater diversion, and perhaps dreissenid filtering activity, is most likely responsible for these changes. However, nitrate concentrations have increased from 70 to 270 mu g/L over the same time period. During 2003-2005, phytoplankton abundance and fish catch were lower in the spring compared to the summer and fall. Microcystis was the most abundant phytoplankton genus; the fish community generally was dominated by round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in spring and summer, and sunfishes (Centrarchidae) in the fall. Dreissenid abundance was highly variable over time, but densities were low relative to Saginaw Bay. Approximately 65% of the Muskegon Lake shoreline has been hardened (i.e., physically altered). Overall, the water quality of Muskegon Lake has improved over the past 30 years, but environmental challenges still exist, including contaminated sediments, loss of natural habitat, and invasive species.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014; Biddanda, Bopaiah/AAB-1705-2019	Rediske, Richard/0000-0002-5048-1063; Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; 													0380-1330					MAR	2008	34	1					169	188		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[169:CSATIM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[169:CSATIM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000255209400014

Lake, river and groundwater were sampled from the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment over four seasons and the downstream Jukskei River was monitored during the winter season. Triazine herbicide concentrations in the Hartbeespoort Dam were in the order atrazine > simazine > propazine > ametryn > prometryn throughout the four seasons sampled. Triazine herbicide concentrations in the Hartbeespoort Dam surface water were highest in summer and gradually decreased in successive seasons of autumn, winter and spring. Terbuthylazine was the only triazine herbicide detected at all sampling sites in the Jukskei River, though atrazine recorded much higher concentrations for the N14 and Kyalami sites, with concentrations of 923 and 210 ng L-1 respectively, compared to 134 and 74 ng L-1 for terbuthylazine. Analytical results in conjunction with river flow data indicate that the Jukskei and Crocodile Rivers contribute the greatest triazine herbicide loads into the Hartbeespoort Dam. No triazine herbicides were detected in the fish muscle tested, showing that bioaccumulation of triazine herbicides is negligible. Atrazine and terbuthylazine metabolites were detected in the fish muscle with deethylatrazine (DEA) being detected in both catfish and carp muscle at low concentrations of 0.2 and 0.3 ng g(-1), respectively. Desethylterbuthylazine (DET) was detected only in catfish at a concentration of 0.3 ng g(-1). With atrazine herbicide groundwater concentrations being >130 ng L-1 for all seasons and groundwater Sigma triazine herbicide concentrations ranging between 527 and 367 ng L-1, triazine compounds in the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment may pose a risk to humans and wildlife in light findings of endocrine and immune disrupting atrazine effects by various researchers.

We compared the observed annual growth of 0- and I-group trout in nine Welsh upland streams, with growth predicted from temperature assuming that this was the only limiting factor. 2. Autumn weights of second year fish were 51-67% of predicted (G(max)) values in 1988, but only 30-40% in 1989 and 1990 when drought occurred. Though initial weights of fry were unknown, simulations suggested that first year growth was also less than G(max), but with no obvious effect of drought. 3. To evaluate the possible effects of future climate change, we simulated stream temperature regimes 1.5-4.5-degrees-C above those of a recent year with temperatures similar to the long-term average. Growth was set at 60% G(max) for both 0- and I-group, or at 40% for I-group to represent the effect of drought. As winter temperature increased, time to hatching and emergence decreased, for example by 56 and 49 days respectively for a rise of 3-degrees-C. 0-group growth was slightly enhanced at up to + 3-degrees-C but retarded at + 4.5-degrees-C. Simulations of I-group growth suggested that warmer winters could enhance trout growth while warmer summers would only increase growth if there were no adverse effects of drought. 4. We discuss many uncertainties in these simulations, which nevertheless suggest the magnitude of possible effects of climate change.

A 6% decrease in delta N-15 observed in brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) samples collected from GSL during summer time periods is likely due to the consumption of cyanobacteria produced in freshwater bays entering the lake. Supporting data collected from the outflow of Farmington Bay indicates decreasing trends in delta N-15 in particulate organic matter (POM) during the mid-summer time period, reflective of increasing proportions of cyanobacteria in algae exported to GSL on a seasonal basis. The C:N molar ratio of POM in outflow from Farmington Bay decreases during the summer period, supportive of the increased activity of N fixation indicated by decreasing delta N-15 in brine shrimp and POM. Although N fixation is only taking place in the relatively freshwater inflows to GSL, data indicate that influx of fresh water influences large areas of the take. Separation of GSL into two distinct hydrologic and geochemical systems from the construction of a railroad causeway in the late 1950s has created a persistent and widespread anoxic layer in the southern part of GSL This anoxic layer, referred to as the deep brine layer (DBL), has high rates of SO42- reduction, likely increasing the Hg methylation capacity. High concentrations of methyl mercury (CH3Hg) (median concentration = 24 ng/L) were observed in the DBL with a significant proportion (31-60%) of total Hg in the CH3Hg form. Hydroacoustic and sediment-trap evidence indicate that turbulence introduced by internal waves generated during sustained wind events can temporarily mix the elevated CH3Hg concentrations in the DBL with the more biologically active upper brine layer (UBL). Brine shrimp collected during the summer/fall time periods contained elevated Hg concentrations (median concentration = 0.34 mg/kg, dry weight (dw)) relative to samples collected during the spring (median concentration < 0.2 mg/kg, dw). Higher Hg in brine shrimp during the summer and fall may reflect the higher proportion of adult brine shrimp during this time period, resulting in an increased time for bioaccumulation of Hg. Eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) consume brine shrimp from GSL during the fall molting period. Median Hg concentrations in eared grebe livers increased by almost three times during the 3-5 month fall molting period. Selected duck species utilizing GSL have consistently exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) screening level for Hg (0.3 mg/kg Hg wet weight), resulting in the issuance of warnings against unlimited human consumption of breast muscle tissue.

The study focuses on the dominant synoptic circulation pattern of heavy snowfall, Central Asian vortices (CAVs), to explore the multi-timescale features and possible influencing factors during cold seasons. The frequency of CAVs in cold seasons shows the "midwinter suppression-like" pattern, which is high in late autumn and early spring but low in winter. The distribution of CAVs is mainly concentrated in the north of Kazakhstan and from the Caspian Sea to the Lake Balkhash, which has caused increased intensity and affected areas of heavy snowfall since the 1980s. The background circulation of CAVs is related to various forcing factors, among which the most important are the North Pacific Victoria mode (VM) and midlatitude North Atlantic anomaly (MNA). VM could stimulate anomalous circumglobal wave train from North Pacific to Central Asia, thereby strengthening cyclonic anomalies over northwestern Central Asia and providing conducive conditions for CAV development. During this process, MNA plays a role in replenishing the wave energy for the circumglobal wave train over North Atlantic and helps the occurrence of CAV heavy snowfall as well. On the shorter timescale, CAVs are modulated by the intraseasonal variation of VM. Within 2.5 weeks before CAV heavy snowfall days, the wave train from North Pacific connects with the downstream wave train, which leads to anomalous wave energy converging in Central Asia and favors the formation of CAVs and related heavy snowfall.

Seasonal climatic niche and migration movements of Double-crested Cormorants	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Avian migrants are challenged by seasonal adverse climatic conditions and energetic costs of long-distance flying. Migratory birds may track or switch seasonal climatic niche between the breeding and non-breeding grounds. Satellite tracking enables avian ecologists to investigate seasonal climatic niche and circannual movement patterns of migratory birds. The Double-crested Cormorant (Nannopterum auritum, hereafter cormorant) wintering in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) migrates to the Northern Great Plains and Great Lakes and is of economic importance because of its impacts on aquaculture. We tested the climatic niche switching hypothesis that cormorants would switch climatic niche between summer and winter because of substantial differences in climate between the non-breeding grounds in the subtropical region and breeding grounds in the northern temperate region. The ordination analysis of climatic niche overlap indicated that cormorants had separate seasonal climatic niche consisting of seasonal mean monthly minimum and maximum temperature, seasonal mean monthly precipitation, and seasonal mean wind speed. Despite non-overlapping summer and winter climatic niches, cormorants appeared to be subjected to similar wind speed between winter and summer habitats and were consistent with similar hourly flying speed between winter and summer. Therefore, substantial differences in temperature and precipitation may lead to the climatic niche switching of fish-eating cormorants, a dietary specialist, between the breeding and non-breeding grounds.																			2045-7758					AUG	2022	12	8							e9153	10.1002/ece3.9153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9153								36016816					WOS:000843054400001
J	Gin, KYH; Guo, JH; Cheong, HF				Gin, KYH; Guo, JH; Cheong, HF			A size-based ecosystem model for pelagic waters	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Size-based models offer a holistic approach to understanding the structure and function of pelagic ecosystems, compared to simple models in which the entire system is represented by a single phytoplankton and zooplankton species. In this study, a one-dimensional size spectral model is constructed to simulate the temporal and vertical variability in the microbial community, nutrients and primary productivity. The approach taken is based on published allometric relationships governing physiological and ecological processes for phytoplankton and zooplankton. Since these allometric relationships are objective estimators of ecological parameters and are not dependent on knowledge of particular species, these models can be used to describe general features of the ecosystem. The model is driven by light, temperature and nutrient availability and is applied to an oligotrophic system in the Sargasso Sea-the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) station, where field data on size spectra has recently been acquired. The model is able to reproduce the general overall features of this oceanic ecosystem fairly well: It depicts a late winter/early spring bloom and low production during the summer and fall months. In addition, a deep subsurface phytoplankton biomass maximum is produced in the summer, consistent with field measurements. The model prediction for size spectra is reasonably successful, although further refinement is necessary. As a whole, the model is fairly robust and can also be applied to ecosystems of different trophic state. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A linear programming model was used for the optimization of income and the quantification of the marginal product value of water, taking 37 cyclic and perennial agricultural activities and introducing 62 restrictions. Results showed a difference of 2.2 million pesos between the current situation and the economic ideal. Under a scenario of optimal allotment without surface restriction, maize (the main crop) would be replaced by wheat and fruit trees. The estimated value of the marginal product of water was between 0.96 and 5.72 pesos per m(3) in the Fall-Winter cycle and between 0.03 and 0.21 pesos per m3 in Spring-Summer. In every case, these economic prices of water are higher than the fees paid by users in the DR044; therefore, a gradual increase of fees could optimize the use and mitigate the waste.																			1870-5472					APR-JUN	2013	10	2					139	156		10.22231/asyd.v10i2.1132	http://dx.doi.org/10.22231/asyd.v10i2.1132													WOS:000215031800001
J	Taub, FB; Wiseman, CD				Taub, FB; Wiseman, CD			Implications of seasonal and regional abundance patterns of Daphnia on surface water monitoring and assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT					3rd Symposium on the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program	APR 08-11, 1997	ALBANY, NEW YORK	US EPA				The seasonal dynamics of Daphnia populations vary regionally throughout the United States. Within the general pattern, Daphnia increase in abundance after the initiation of the spring algal bloom in all lakes, but their subsequent seasonal patterns differ in various climatic regions. Lakes in regions with cooler summers have large-bodied Daphnia populations that tend to persist throughout the summer, although the species dominance may shift. Regions with warmer summers tend to have large-bodied Daphnia populations that decline or are absent through much of the summer. Still warmer water bodies tend to have medium-to small-bodied species that are abundant during spring, but absent most of the summer. Many central Florida lakes lack Daphnia; if Daphnia species are present, they tend to be small-bodied. Daphnia abundance in these water bodies varies, but seems to be independent of temperature. If surface water (lake, pond) sampling is done in all regions during July and August, the impression will be that Daphnia are absent from large segments of the United States. This would be erroneous, because Daphnia are important earlier during the spring and early summer but are likely to be absent during midsummer in some U.S. regions. Year-to-year variation will be superimposed on this regional pattern. Because there are differences in the dates when spring and summer occur, it would be useful to have an index period that would standardize the start of the growing season. The use of the terrestrial onset of greenness, based on remote sensing of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, is suggested as a possible index set point.

Gill nets were set simultaneously at three different sites of a chosen littoral zone: shore, middle and far (50, 300 and 550 m from the shore, respectively). The results show that in summer more species and individuals are present in the littoral zone than in winter. Throughout the year, species richness is greater at the shore site than at the middle or far site. In summer, total abundance is greater at the far site, whereas there are more fish at the shore site during winter. Perch (juveniles and adults), roach and gudgeon (adults only), have maximum abundance during the summer, while lake trout, grayling and whitefish (adults) have maximum abundance during the winter. For five species (adults only) the site comparison shows spatial segregation of the habitats: greater numbers of perch are present at the far site while roach, tench, lake trout and grayling prefer the shore site.																			0018-8158					MAR 24	1995	300						321	327		10.1007/BF00024472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024472													WOS:A1995RB62500030

The vertical distributions of dissolved arsenic species and some diagenetic constituents [Fe(II), Mn(II), S(-II)] were also obtained in the same porewater samples in summer and winter. In sediments the concentration profiles of total As and As species bound to Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and to organic matter were also determined along with the concentrations of Fe, Mn and S in different extractable fractions. Results indicate that, in the summer season, the concentrations of total dissolved As varying from 3.9 to 55.8 mu g/L in sediments were higher than those (5.3-15.7 mu g/L) measured in the winter season, while the concentrations of total As species in the solid phase varied between 10.97 and 25.32 mg/kg and between 7.84 and 30.52 mg/kg on a dry weight basis in summer and winter, respectively. Seasonal profiles of dissolved As suggest downward and upward diffusion, and the flux of dissolved As across the sediment-water interface (SWI) in summer and winter were estimated at 3.88 mg/m(2) a and 0.79 mg/m(2) a, respectively. Based on porewater profiles and sediment phase data, the main geochemical behavior of As was controlled by adsorption/desorption, precipitation and molecular diffusion. The solubility and migration of inorganic As are controlled by Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides in summer whereas they appear to be more likely controlled by both amorphous Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and sulfides in winter. A better knowledge of the cycle of As in Poyang Lake is essential to a better management of its hydrology and for the environmental protection of biota in the lake. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lemoine, N; Böhning-Gaese, K				Lemoine, N; Böhning-Gaese, K			Potential impact of global climate change on species richness of long-distance migrants	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Little evidence exists demonstrating that global climate change leads to systematic changes in the structure of ecological communities. For avian communities, one would expect warmer winters to lead to declines in numbers of long-distance migrants if resident birds benefit from warmer winters and impose increasing competitive pressure on migrants. To study the potential influence of global climate change on long-distance migrants, we correlated the number of all species of land birds and the number and proportion of long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, and residents in 595 grid cells across Europe. We used mean temperature of the coldest month, mean spring temperature, and spring precipitation as measures of climatic conditions in winter and during the breeding period. The number and proportion of long-distance migrants decreased with increasing winter temperature, decreasing spring temperature, and increasing spring precipitation. We used this spatial relationship between bird community structure and climate in Europe to make predictions about changes in bird communities of the Lake Constance region, Central Europe, between two census periods (1980-1981 and 1990-1992). Winter temperature in this region increased significantly between the two censuses, whereas spring temperature and precipitation did not change. As predicted from the models, the proportion of long-distance migrants decreased and the number and proportion of short-distance migrants and residents increased between the two censuses. The significant declines of the long-distance migrants in the Lake Constance region are of a magnitude that can be explained by the observed climate change. Our results suggest that increasingly warmer winters may pose a more severe threat to long-distance migrants than to the other bird groups.

Further, understanding the underlying processes driving a species' behaviour and habitat use is important as changes in behaviour could result from changes in environmental conditions. Methods In this study, the dives of Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) were classified for the first time using hidden Markov models and telemetry data collected on individual dives, and the behavioural states of the diving seals were estimated. In addition, we used generalized additive mixed models on the foraging probability of the seals to identify environmental and temporal drivers of foraging behaviour. Results We inferred three (in winter) or four (in summer) different dive types: sleeping/resting dives, shallow inactive dives, transiting dives and foraging dives, based on differences in dive metrics logged by or derived from data from telemetry tags. Long and relatively deep sleeping/resting dives were missing entirely in the winter, compensated by an increased proportion of time used for haul-out. We found profound differences in the behaviour of Saimaa ringed seals during the open water season compared to the ice-covered winter, with the greatest proportion of time allocated to foraging during the summer months (36%) and the lowest proportion in the winter (21%). The seals' foraging probability peaked in summer (July) and was highest during the daytime during both summer and winter months. Moreover, foraging probability was highest at lake depths of 7-30 m in the winter and at depths > 15 m in the summer. We also found some evidence of sex-specific foraging strategies that are adapted seasonally, with females preferring more sheltered water areas during winter. Conclusions We suggest that the foraging behaviour of Saimaa ringed seals is largely influenced by diel vertical movements and availability of fish, and that the seals optimize their energy acquisition while conserving energy, especially during the cold winter months. Further, the seals display some flexibility in foraging strategies, a feature that may help this endangered subspecies to cope with the ongoing climate change.					; Carter, Matt/AAT-8624-2020	Carter, Matt/0000-0002-5481-6254; Pirotta, Enrico/0000-0003-3541-3676													2051-3933					APR 25	2025	13	1							31	10.1186/s40462-025-00555-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-025-00555-4								40281639					WOS:001476780000001

J	Schwanke, CJ; Hubert, WA				Schwanke, CJ; Hubert, WA			Structure, abundance, and movements of an allacustrine population of rainbow trout in the Naknek River, Southwest Alaska	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Allacustrine rainbow trout move downstream from Naknek Lake into the Naknek River to spawn, and become vulnerable to angling during the spawning season. Regulations, including an annual angling closure from 10 April through 7 June, have been implemented to protect spawning fish from angling mortality, but the synchrony of the angling closure to the time when sexually mature fish are present in the river was unknown. We describe (1) the length structure and abundance of sexually mature fish in the spawning population and (2) the post-spawning movements of sexually mature fish. We sampled sexually mature fish ranging from 424 to 860 mm fork length during 2000 and 2001. The spawning population was estimated to be similar to 3,000 fish. Of 70 radio-tagged fish, 80% moved from the river to the lake by 8 June 2001, but several fish remained in the river throughout the summer. More than half of the radio-tagged fish that moved to the lake returned to the river during the fall and early winter. A substantial portion of the spawning population was protected by the annual angling closure, but some fish were not protected because they remained in the river through the summer or returned to the river before it froze in the fall.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				FAL	2003	77	4					340	348																WOS:000187289200007

However, the relative contribution of external and internal sources to eutrophication is still unclear especially for reservoirs with water transfer disturbance. The objective of this paper is to estimate the phosphorus loading from external (water transfer and diffusing emission) and internal sources (sediment release) in Yuqiao Reservoir (YQR) and compare their relative contribution of external and internal sources. In this study, we estimated the phosphorus loading considering both external (water transfer and diffusing source emission) and internal (release from sediment) sources of YQR. The phosphorus loading from water transfer was estimated by total phosphorus (TP) concentration x monthly flow of inflow. The phosphorus loading from nonpoint source emission was estimated using a generalized watershed loading function (GWLF). The phosphorus loading from internal sources was estimated with a Bayesian phosphorus budget model. Our result showed that water transfer TP load is the biggest (45.2%) source of TP load in YQR and internal TP load (20.5%) accounts for a comparable proportion of TP load as nonpoint source (34.3%) in YQR and dominates the total loading in some months. Analysis of seasonal total phosphorus load apportionment indicated that water transfer TP load takes the largest proportion in winter (60.8%), spring (60.2%), and autumn (47.8%). Nonpoint source TP load takes the largest proportion in summer (60.1%), and internal TP load is the second source of YQR in summer (22.4%). Our study indicates that water transfer may be the major driver of eutrophication for some reservoir systems, and sediment release may prevent recovery of many eutrophic lakes and reservoirs. Our analysis suggests that TP pollution control strategies in YQR should be preferentially focused on the improvement of water quality in the upstream reservoir, and nonpoint source TP load reductions should be focused on summer. Compared with conventional nutrient apportionment model applications, this paper provides a new approach to estimate external and internal TP loads simultaneously.

The transported course particulate plant material has been collected in traps; the particles and colloids have been removed from water samples by cross-flow ultrafiltration. On the basis of radionuclide inputs and outputs, lake budget calculations have been made for Cs-137 and Sr-90 during the period of ice-cover. Daily transport of radionuclides is considerably less than that observed during the spring snowmelt period when discharges are high. Size distribution patterns of Cs and Sr observed during winter are compared with previously published data from the same lake during the spring spate. The retention of Cs-137 is similar in winter and spring, but retention of Sr-90 is greater in winter.																			0003-2654					MAR	1992	117	3					515	519		10.1039/an9921700515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/an9921700515								1580392					WOS:A1992HM86300054

The lake is known as one of the most polluted lakes in Japan. Water sampling was made once in a week during the period from June 1985 to June 1988. Each water sample was filtered through a 0.45-mu-m membrane filter and used for the determination of concentrations. From these results, the mean values of the dissolved TOC of spring, summer, autumn and winter seasons in the western part of Lake Inba-numa were 8.8 mg/l, 9.8 mg/l, 9.4 mg/l and 8.3 mg/l, respectively. The TOC value tends to increase from June to September and decrease from November to March excepting aquatic plant area but in the aquatic plant area this tends to increase from October to November. The dissolved TOC of summer season was composed of proteins, 22 approximately 27%; carbohydrates, 24 approximately 32%; volatile organic acids, 10 approximately 22%; anionic surfactants, 2 approximately 3%; humic acids, 1 approximately 3%; lignin, 1 approximately 4%; tannin, 2 approximately 4%; urea, 4 approximately 9%; and lipids, 1 approximately 4%. The sum of the components of proteins, carbohydrates, volatile organic acids and anionic surfactants was 68.8% of dissolved TOC and that in the influent of domestic wastewater about 67%. As one of the causes of the pollution of the western part of Lake Inba-numa, the influx of organic substances from the catchment area similar to those present in the domestic wastewater, may contribute greatly. The western part of Lake Inba-numa may be strongly affected by the matter production of Trapa vegetation.																			0369-4577					JUN	1991		6					852	858		10.1246/nikkashi.1991.852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/nikkashi.1991.852													WOS:A1991FV24400022

Seasonal trends in mass sedimentation were different among lakes but consistent from year to year within each lake. High rates of nutrient sedimentation were associated with spring and fall blooms of large siliceous algae. Nutrient recycling, calculated as the difference between uptake during photosynthesis and loss to sedimentation, showed seasonal trends that were related to sedimentation. Recycling within the water column was the most important source of nutrients to primary producers, accounting for 85-90% of P demand during the summer stratified period.

Study focus: Dongting Lake is the first large-scale interconnected river-lake systems in the middlelower reaches of the Yangtze River and the second-largest freshwater lake in China. Dam operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River dramatically affected the hydrological condition of Dongting Lake. Therefore, this study established a hydrodynamic-water age model to assess the effects of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on the spatiotemporal pattern of water age in Dongting Lake. New hydrological insights: The results show a significant spatial and temporal variation of water age in Dongting Lake. Water age in the floodway is lower than that in the shoal, meanwhile, water age in spring and summer is lower than that in autumn and winter. By establishing a hydrodynamic-water age model, several factors influencing water age in Dongting Lake were analyzed, i.e., the influences of the Jingjiang Three Outlets' triage from the Yangtze River, the water level of the mainstream of the Yangtze River, and the flow pattern. The TGD could influence the water age in Dongting Lake by altering the hydrodynamic conditions of the Yangtze River. Results from this study provide support for flood control and dispatch management of Dongting Lake and provides a reference for water exchange studies in other large shallow lakes.																				2214-5818				OCT	2024	55								101902	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101902													WOS:001286424000001

The long-term (1979-2005) effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation on wind-induced wave mixing in Loch Leven (Scotland)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th Shallow Lakes Congress 2008	NOV 23-28, 2008	Punta del Este, URUGUAY					We report on long-term covariation (1979-2005) between indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and wind speed and direction in Loch Leven. The effects of the observed variations in wind speed and direction were combined to produce modelled wave-mixed depths (Zc). Positive correlations were observed between seasonal and annual wind speeds and westerly frequency and indices of the NAO that are in line with general perception: positive NAO was correlated with stronger, more westerly winds and these correlations were strongest in winter and spring. Correlations between NAO and estimates of Zc were strongest in the most westerly exposed site in spring (r (2) = 0.701; Zc(spring) versus spring NAO index). On average, over a 25-year period Zc was deeper in spring and shallower in summer. Major anomalies from the 25-year seasonal means were observed in 1982, 1979, and 1991. Annual average Zc was low in the late 1970s and early 1980s (shallowest average annual Zc of 1.0 m (1984)), high in the late 1980s and early 1990s (deepest average annual Zc of 1.9 m (1990)) and moderate in recent years (up to 2005). This study has major implications for our understanding of potential climate change drivers and the related responses of shallow lake ecosystems, including alterations to littoral habitat quality and benthic-pelagic coupling.

The biomass of benthic grazers and periphyton in the presence/absence of fish was measured and the periphyton production was compared with the consumption rates using a model-based approach. A three-level trophic cascade from benthivorous fish via benthic grazers to periphyton was evident from the field experiment. Integrated over the whole study period, fish reduced the biomass of benthic grazers and indirectly increased the periphyton biomass. Scenario analyses, using a simple dynamic model, indicated top-down control of periphyton to be strongest during autumn, when periphyton growth was light-limited, and weaker in the spring, when periphyton growth was not light-limited. The seasonal light supply variation was caused by shading due to deciduous riparian trees during the vegetation period. This asymmetry in temporal processes weakened the top-down control in a natural benthic community. Even though grazer biomass is naturally reduced in summer, due to the emergence of the most abundant species (mayflies), a grazer biomasses high enough to reduce the spring periphyton peak could not be sustained by the low summer periphyton growth. We suppose that the temporal decoupling of grazer biomass from periphyton biomass might be caused by the very short generation time of the primary producers (days) compared with the long generation time of the primary consumers (mostly 1year).

C	Williams, JD		Eversole, AG		Williams, JD			Walleye movement, distribution, and habitat use in Laurel River Lake, Kentucky	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTY-FIFTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE SOUTHEASTERN ASSOCIATION OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES					55th Annual Conference of the Southeastern-Association-of-Fish-and-Wildlife-Agencies	OCT 13-17, 2001	LOUISVILLE, KY	SE Assoc Fish & Wildlife Agcy				Movement, distribution, and habitat use of walleyes (Stizostedion vitreum) in Laurel River Lake, Kentucky were determined by radio-tracking 35 walleyes for 605 days (mean = 249 days) from March 1994 through November 1995. The goal of this study was to increase the angler utilization of walleyes in Laurel River Lake by educating anglers on walleye movement patterns, habitat usage, and distribution within the lake. Walleye movement (as measured in distance between weekly locations) was highest during the spring (median = 120 m/day) and lowest during the summer (median = 53 m/day). During the summer, most walleyes confined their activities to specific areas of the lake and were often located in the same area during,consecutive weeks. Activity areas ranged from 2 to 590 ha with 75% of walleyes utilizing areas <300 ha. Walleyes were widely distributed throughout the lake during each season, although only 2 walleyes remained in the upper Laurel River arm during July and August. Walleyes predominately oriented to standing (flooded) timber located only in coves on an annual basis (53%) and even more (59%) in the summer. Walleyes moved deeper as summer progressed, which coincided with an increase in the median depth of the thermocline. During summer stratification, walleyes selected water temperatures averaging 23.0 C (mean depth 6.1 m). Walleyes were most active at night, with mean peak movements occurring at 0200 hours (396 m/hour) in the spring, 2200 hours (174 m/hour) in the summer, and 0400 hours (198 m/hour) in the fall. Walleyes typically moved out of the timbered coves at night and either traveled along the shoreline, suspended at the edge of timber near the mouth of the cove, or suspended in open water in the main lake. Walleyes usually returned to the same cove by morning, although they occasionally returned to a nearby cove. Information gained from this study should improve walleye angler success in Laurel River Lake and perhaps in other southern reservoirs. Walleye harvest is expected to increase in Laurel River Lake as anglers use the information gained from this study.																									2001							257	269																WOS:000184053000024
J	HUMPHRIES, P				HUMPHRIES, P			VARIATION IN THE LIFE-HISTORY OF DIADROMOUS AND LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS OF THE SPOTTED GALAXIAS, GALAXIAS-TRUTTACEUS VALENCIENNES, IN TASMANIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Variations in life history traits such as age class distribution, growth, gonadal development, reproductive investment and spawning time were studied in two stream-dwelling diadromous and two landlocked freshwater lake populations of the spotted galaxias, Galaxias truttaceus, in Tasmania. Whereas stream populations were dominated by 0+, 1+ and 2+ age-class fish, lake populations had a smaller proportion of these younger individuals and a larger proportion of age classes older than 2+. Growth in both lake and stream populations was slow over winter and more rapid during spring and summer. The majority of fish of both sexes matured at age two, irrespective of size, although some lake-dwelling males matured in their first year. Gonadal development commenced at the beginning of summer (December) in all populations. Spawning in stream-dwelling populations occurred before winter (May) and was associated with decreasing water temperature and photoperiod. By contrast, landlocked populations spawned in early spring (September), at which time both temperature and photoperiod were increasing. At spawning, landlocked females invested more energy in reproduction than did riverine females. This appeared to be a function of larger egg size in females from one lake population and greater fecundity in females from the other. Although G. truttaceus fits the general life-history model for diadromous galaxiids, having relatively large numbers of small eggs, the shift in spawning time for landlocked populations, and the inter-population variations in egg size and fecundity suggest considerable flexibility in the characteristics of this species'' life history.

Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria globally dominated the bacterioplankton, whereas Gammaproteobacteria and Archaea never exceeded 3 and 6% of the community, respectively. The different groups showed seasonality, with simultaneous peaks of all bacterial group absolute abundances during late winter or spring, and with peaks of Archaea during winter, late spring and summer. The bacterial groups presented roughly similar relative abundances in all seasons, whereas Archaea varied in their relative contribution to community structure. Multivariate analyses showed that dissolved organic carbon was an important variable structuring the community at the studied taxonomic resolution (using absolute and relative abundances), in both among and within-lake patterns. The absolute abundance of most bacterial groups was significantly higher in mesotrophic and eutrophic systems than in oligotrophic ones (except Actinobacteria), whereas their relative abundances did not change among trophic states (except Bacteroidetes). The lake grouping obtained from CARD-FISH was consistent with previous work using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis data: deep oligotrophic lakes clustered together, whereas small and shallow water bodies grouped separately.					; Gasol, Josep/B-1709-2008; Sánchez, María Laura/AAZ-1382-2021; Gasol, Josep M/B-1709-2008	Sanchez, Maria Laura/0000-0001-5831-1811; Schiaffino, Maria Romina/0000-0002-9383-2003; Balague, Vanessa/0000-0001-6813-8207; Gerea, Marina/0000-0003-3143-8737; Gasol, Josep M/0000-0001-5238-2387; Unrein, Fernando/0000-0002-8592-1858													0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN-FEB	2016	38	1					64	82		10.1093/plankt/fbv105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbv105													WOS:000371229900007

Transmitters were implanted in 1 7 loons (16 adults and one juvenile) that were captured on breeding lakes in New York, New Hampshire, and Maine during the summers of 2003, 2004, and 2005. Transmitters from ten of the birds provided adequate location data to document movement to wintering areas. Most adult loons appeared to travel non-stop from breeding lakes, or neighboring lakes (within 15 km), to the Atlantic coast. Adult looms marked in New Hampshire and Maine wintered 152 to 239 km from breeding lakes, along the Maine coast. Adult loons marked in the Adirondack Park of New York wintered along the coasts of Massachusetts (414 km from breeding lake), Rhode Island (362 km), and southern New Jersey (527 km). Most of the loons remained relatively stationary throughout the winter, but the size of individual wintering areas of adult loons ringed front 43 to 1,159 km(2), based on a 95% fixed kernel utilization distribution probability. A juvenile bird from New York made a number of stops at lakes and reservoirs cn route to Long Island Sound (325 km front breeding lake). Maximum functional life of transmitters was about 12 months, providing an opportunity to document spring migration movements as well.

Effects of lake water level fluctuation due to drought and extreme winter precipitation on mixing and water quality of an alpine lake, Case Study: Lake Arrowhead, California	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Arrowhead, an oligotrophic alpine lake in southern California, experienced a drought period from summer 2012 to winter 2018 followed by a season of intense storms in winter 2019 resulting in lake flooding. This study investigates the effects of seasonal variations combined with 3.5 m water level fluctuation from May 2018 to April 2019, on water quality and hydrodynamics of Lake Arrowhead. In-situ measured meteorological data and water quality profiles in five different bays were used to develop and calibrate a three-dimensional lake hydrodynamic model. The mean relative errors between simulated and measured temperature and salinity profiles were 6.1% and 42%, respectively. Root mean square errors between the measured and simulated water temperatures were slightly larger during the stratified period. However, no specific pattern was observed in error analysis of salinity simulations. Strong thermal stratification during summer and early-fall resulted in hypoxic hypolimnetic waters with dis- solved oxygen (DO) concentrations of <1 mg L-1. Turbulent kinetic energy (TICE) generated by convective motions in the water column due to surface heat loss was typically more than two times greater than the wind-induced mixing energy during the stratification period. The lake experienced an energetic turbulent mixing regime with TICE fluxes >1.5 m(-3) s(-3), and Lake numbers <0.1 during the winter cooling period, resulting in a complete water column turnover and resuspension of bottom sediments. Entrainment of the hypoxic hypolimnion layers and sediment resuspension resulted in decreased DO and pH in the water column from December 2018 through mid-January 2019. Comparisons of Wedderburn and Lake numbers during different stratification conditions indicated the same trends in the strong stratification period (square of buoyancy frequency >10(-4) s(-2)). However, in other conditions, the Lake number, considering the lake bathymetry and density profile, could better reflect vertical mixing conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The lake, which has been exposed to different stressors including climate variability and changing land use, has significant recreational, historical and environmental value. The Diss Mere sediments are annually-laminated for most of the Holocene (2.1-10.3 ka BP), which allows the study of the lake evolution and its response to changing environmental conditions at an exceptionally high resolution. As with many mid-latitude, alkaline lakes, Diss Mere's sediments are formed of biogenic-calcite varves. We have conducted a 3.5-year lake-monitoring survey including sediment trapping to identify the main drivers and seasonal processes contributing to lake sedimentation. Our results demonstrate that the modern lake is still producing seasonally-differentiated sediments today, however, are unable to be preserved as varves due to the permanent oxygenation of the lake bottom through gradual lake shallowing. Seasonal sediment fluxes follow a general pattern of (i) an early spring-diatom bloom; (ii) spring precipitation of medium-coarse calcite grains; (iii) summer precipitation of smaller endogenic calcite grains; and (iv) an autumn algal bloom and endogenic calcite precipitation intermixed with benthic diatoms and micrite. Whilst calcite precipitates throughout the whole year, peaks are observed in the epilimnion during the summer. This study shows that a modern analogue approach can be applied to the varves revealing their potential for environmental and climate reconstruction and highlights the significance of monitoring surveys for modern analogue approaches to palaeolimnological research.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station Fish Diversion System Barrier Net	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Barrier nets can be an effective alternative for reducing impingement mortality of fish at power plant intakes. In 2010, a paired, split-beam hydroacoustic method was used as the primary assessment tool for comparing relative fish density between the lake ("outside") and station ("inside") side of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station fish diversion system (FDS) barrier net while it was in place. Behavioral information was also collected using a DIDSON acoustic camera and underwater video camera to determine fish responses to the FDS. Verification monitoring was completed using conventional gill netting. The DIDSON provided useful and valuable information on relative fish densities, relative school sizes, and behavior of fish as individuals, small groups, or schools on both the outside and inside of the FDS, as well as general behavior of fish approaching the FDS. There was no evidence of passage through the net based on DIDSON evaluation; however, fish passage occurred when the FDS net was considered to be in a degraded condition (from biofouling or storm events, or both) and passage occurred over the net, not through it. Analysis of the hydroacoustic data based on the weighted average biomass indicated that FDS effectiveness was 75, 98, and 100% for the spring, summer, and fall periods, respectively, and 98% for the three seasons combined. The summer and fall estimates were based on net performance under optimal net-deployment conditions and if the net degrades, effectiveness is reduced significantly as observed in the spring data. Our study results were supported by impingement monitoring at the station whereby impingement biomass was reduced by greater than 80% for each of the first 3years after installation compared with before installation of the barrier net. Overall, the FDS was demonstrated to offer significant fish protection from potential impingement at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station.

For this study region, in the central Mackenzie River valley of western Canada, lakes make up 37% of the landscape. The nonlake components of the landscape are divided into uplands (55%) and wetlands (8%). With such abundance, lakes are important features that can influence the regional climate. This paper examines the role of takes in the regional surface energy and water balance and evaluates the links to the frequency-size distribution of lakes. The primary purpose is to examine how the surface energy balance may influence regional climate and weather. Lakes are characterized by both the magnitude and temporal behavior of their surface energy balances during the ice-free period. The impacts of combinations of various-size takes and land-lake distributions oil regional energy balances and evaporation cycles are presented. Net radiation is substantially greater over all water-dominated surfaces compared with uplands. The seasonal heat storage increases with lake size. Medium and large lakes are slow to warm in summer. Their large cumulative heat storage, near summer's end, fuels large convective heat fluxes in fall and early winter. The evaporation season for upland, wetland, and small, medium, and large lakes lasts for 19, 21, 22, 24, and 30 weeks, respectively. The regional effects of combinations of surface types are derived. The region is initially treated as comprising uplands only. The influences of wetland, small, medium, and large lakes are added sequentially, to build up to the energy budget of the actual landscape. The addition of lakes increases the regional net radiation, the maximum regional subsurface heat storage, and evaporation substantially. Evaporation decreases slightly in the first half of the season but experiences a large enhancement in the second half. The sensible heat flux is reduced substantially in the first half of the season, but changes little in the second half. For energy budget modeling the representation of lake size is important. Net radiation is fairly independent of size. All equal area of medium and large lakes, compared with small lakes. yields substantially larger latent heat fluxes and lesser sensible heat fluxes. Lake size also creates large differences in regional flux magnitudes, especially in the spring and fall periods.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	BLANKEN, PETER/0000-0002-7405-2220; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850													1525-755X					JUN	2005	6	3					291	305		10.1175/JHM421.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM421.1													WOS:000230393600005

Compensatory nutrient enrichment in an oligotrophicated mountain reservoir - effects and fate of added nutrients	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Most Scandinavian rivers are impounded for power production. High altitude reservoirs retain water during summer and fall for power production during winter and spring. The oligotrophic lakes Mjolkvattnet and Burvattnet were impounded in 1942. Annual water level fluctuations caused by regulation have resulted in a loss of littoral habitat, and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations have declined. To assess compensatory nutrient enrichment as a remedy against declining fish populations, we added dissolved phosphate and nitrate to Mjolkvattnet in June and July in 2002 and 2003, and used the upstream lake Burvattnet as a reference system. Nutrient addition doubled water column total phosphorus concentration, from 3 to 6 mu g P/L and increased nitrogen concentration by about 20 mu g/L. Half of the added phosphorus settled out as organic matter, and about one third was lost downstream. Phytoplankton production and biomass increased, but species composition remained principally unchanged. Rotifers and cladocerans responded rapidly, as did the condition of fish. After two years of nutrient addition, five year old Arctic char had doubled in weight and increased significantly in length, reaching pre-impoundment conditions.

Ventical phytoplankton profiles were identified and counted to derive seasonal succession patterns and population concentrations. Vertical profiles of nitrate, phosphorus, chlorophyll a, phaeophytin a, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and light were also recorded at the sampling sites. Distributions of phytoplankton were seasonal; approximately 104 cells/ml occurred in the epilimnion during summer stratification. The lake was dominated (89%) by blue-gree algae (Oscillatoriaceae and Nostocaeae). Diatoms and green algae were important during spring and winter, respectively. Horizontal phytoplankton distributions throughout the lake were similar and correlated well with chlorophyll a concentrations. Nitrate concentrations were generally low (< 0.3 mg NO3/l) to non-detectable during the summer. Total phosphorus was found to be high, averaging 35 .mu.g/l on the surface. Candlewood Lake is thus in an early eutrophic state.																			0035-4902	1938-3401				JUL	1986	88	855					331	346																WOS:A1986D426300004

Winter and Summer Home Ranges and Core Use Areas of Double-crested Cormorants Captured near Aquaculture Facilities in the Southeastern United States	WATERBIRDS												Numbers of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) wintering in the southeastern United States have increased dramatically during the last 30 years concomitant with the rise of the aquaculture industry in this region. These cormorants commonly foraged at commercial aquaculture facilities and thereby came into conflict with farmers. Various interest groups are seeking ecologically sound strategies for minimizing the effects of burgeoning cormorant populations. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate winter and summer home ranges of cormorants captured in the southeastern U.S. and determine whether age class, body mass, density of aquaculture facilities and availability of roost sites influenced size of these home ranges. Mean +/- SE home range size and core use area of satellite transmitter-marked cormorants wintering in the southeastern U.S. from 1999 to 2001 were 17,490 +/- 1,986 km(2) (N = 37) and 1,550 +/- 265 km(2) (N = 37), respectively. Winter home range size was not affected by region, age class or body mass. Summer home range and core use area of marked cormorants was 30,547 +/- 6,197 km(2) (N = 6) and 3,124 +/- 1,019 km(2) (N = 6), respectively.

In this study, we investigated the spatial and seasonal distributions of 2-MIB in waters of Lake Yangcheng, a large eutrophic shallow lake in China. Driving factors affecting the production and accumulation of 2-MIB were further analyzed. The results showed that 2-MIB concentrations in Lake Yangcheng ranged from 0.4 to 940.6 ng/L, with a high annual average concentration of 35.6 ng/L. Distinct seasonal and spatial variations of 2-MIB were found in the lake waters. Specifically, 2-MIB concentrations were highest in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and lowest in winter, whereas 2-MIB concentrations generally exceeded the odor threshold (< 10 ng/L) in the first three seasons. Spatially, 2-MIB concentrations were highest in the eastern lake, and followed by the central and the western lake. The environmental conditions of a higher water temperature and lower TN:TP ratio (TN:TP < 29:1) were more favorable to the production and accumulation of 2-MIB in Lake Yangcheng. The algal abundance analysis and correlation analysis showed that cyanobacteria species including Microcystis spp. and Phormidium spp. were closely related to the production of 2-MIB and were considered as the main driving factors of the accumulation of 2-MIB in Lake Yangcheng. Therefore, controlling the eutrophication level and algal blooms are of great importance to alleviate 2-MIB pollution in lake waters.

Behavior, escapement, and mortality of adult Muskellunge in Midwestern reservoirs	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Muskellunge Esox masquinongy is a popular species commonly introduced to warm-water reservoirs; however, little is known about seasonal habitat use and movement in these systems which may result in reservoir escapement and reduced Muskellunge abundance. Our objectives were to assess Muskellunge seasonal behaviors and quantify escapement and natural mortality to determine their effects on populations. Muskellunge captured from the lake and spillway were implanted with radio tags in Big Creek (n = 17) and Brushy Creek (n = 30) lakes, Iowa, USA beginning October 2016 and tracked through May 2019. Telemetry data were used to quantify depth at fish locations, movement rates, annual core and home ranges, and proportions of tagged Muskellunge using spillway approach areas. Telemetry encounter data were analyzed using a multi-state model with water temperature and reservoir water level covariates to estimate escapement and natural mortality. Muskellunge in Brushy Creek were located in deeper water than in Big Creek, but depth and movement were similar across seasons and behavior did not differ between fish captured in-lake and the spillway. Big Creek Muskellunge exhibited greater movements in spring, were located in shallow water and moved less in summer, and were found in deeper water during winter. Core and home ranges were similar between lakes and many tagged Muskellunge frequently used spillway approach areas during spring and summer. No escapement occurred from Big Creek (physical barrier on spillway) while weekly escapement probability from Brushy Creek (no barrier) was up to 0.13 and annual escapement ranged from 18 to 54 %. Escapement was greatest from May-August and increased with increasing weekly maximum reservoir level. Natural mortality was similar between systems, ranged from 15 to 18 % annually, and increased with water temperature. Our results suggest escapement can lead to greater loss of Muskellunge from reservoir populations than natural mortality and may be greater in spring and summer. However, escapement does not appear to be associated with fish behaviors.

However, research on the distribution patterns of bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) within a small-sized, highly dynamic freshwater lake remains unclear. In this study, we collected surface water samples from West Lake to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of BCC by 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Clear spatial heterogeneity in BCC was identified both in summer and winter. The relatively high abundant taxa exhibited greater correlations with environmental factors and other abundant species in summer than in winter. Variation partitioning analysis was used to unravel the relative importance of environmental factors and spatial processes and further explore the underlying mechanism of BCC successions. Our results showed the predominant shared effect of environmental and spatial factors on BCC in summer (68.41%) and winter (57.37%), indicating that spatially structured environmental factors were the key determinants of structuring BCC spatial heterogeneity in West Lake in the two seasons. Furthermore, environmental factors alone explained a higher proportion of the variation in summer whereas spatial factors explained a higher proportion in winter. These divergences may be related to seasonal environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbances. Our study provided knowledge on BCC spatial heterogeneity in small freshwater habitats and their underlying determinants in different seasons.

L. and Worth, D. 2013. Methane emissions from a swine manure tank in western Canada. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 93: 159-169. The emission rate of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere was measured from a concrete manure tank at a farrow-to-finish swine facility in western Canada. Measurements were made during four seasonal campaigns using a bLS inverse-dispersion technique. Emission rates were highest in summer and lowest in winter, with intermediate rates in spring and fall. Annual emissions were estimated at 7600 kg CH4, or 6.3 kg CH4 m(-2) of tank surface area. Site-specific factors used for estimating CH4 emissions were calculated from our measurements. A simple methane conversion factor, used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to relate emissions to the volatile solids content of the manure, was calculated as 0.23. This value may be unrepresentatively high due to the long duration (15 mo) that manure was stored in the tank. A more sophisticated calculation methodology considers the influence of manure storage duration and temperature, and includes a critical management design practices (MDP) factor. The MDP factor was calculated as 0.31 for our tank. This MDP value implies that emissions from our manure tank were lower than expected given the results from other studies.

The underlying mechanisms, however, are uncertain. A likely explanation is that flooding has both direct effects by exerting stress on plants and indirect effects by affecting soil nutrient availability. The net effect would be context-specific and might depend on season. Here, we tested two potential factors mediating the flooding effects on wetland plant biomass: soil nutrient availability and season. We carried out a field investigation in the lakeshore meadows of the Poyang Lake floodplain, China, along a flooding duration gradient during the non-flooding period. To test the interaction between flooding duration and soil nutrients, we carried out a nutrient (N and P) addition experiment in two types of communities with different flooding durations. The above-ground biomass (AGB) decreased with flooding duration in winter but had a quadratic response in spring, suggesting that the direct negative effect of flooding was stronger in winter than in spring. Soil total N content, total P content, and N:P ratio showed quadratic responses to flooding duration. Our results supported the hypotheses that the influence of nutrient limitation decreased with flooding duration and was greater in spring than in winter. The evidence showed that, with longer flooding duration and in winter than in spring, the correlations between AGB and soil nutrient content were weaker, leaf N and P content of Carex cinerascens were stronger, and AGB response ratio to nutrient addition was lower. Meanwhile, the relative importance of N versus P to wetland plant biomass varied with flooding duration. Consequently, indirect effects of flooding duration on AGB via soil nutrient availability were much less important than direct effects in winter or with long flooding duration, but were more important in spring or with short flooding duration. Therefore, the effects of flooding on wetland plant biomass depended on flooding duration, soil nutrient availability, and season.

In this research, in Balihe Lake which is an agricultural watershed lake, 11 environmental parameters (pH, water temperature, water depth, turbidity, DO, COD, TN, NH4+-N, NO3--N, TP, Chl-a) are monitored at 45 sampling sites in four seasons (winter of 2016, spring, summer, and autumn of 2017). With these monitoring data, two kinds of multivariate statistical methods including cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to evaluate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the surface water quality. The results reveal that the spatial clusters (less, moderately, and highly polluted sections) of 45 sampling sites classified by the CA method are exactly consistent with the geographical distribution of these sampling sites, which rely on water quality meliorating downstream. From the perspective of time scale, the correlations between environmental parameters generated by the PCA method reveal that the main factors affecting the surface water quality are different in the four seasons. For the whole study period, which is a longer time scale rather than season, the main factors are also different to that of any season. Large time scale may weaken the effect and potential risk of nutrients on water quality, and it is therefore reasonable to select seasonal scale for the study of water quality in an agricultural watershed by using PCA. The results of this research may demonstrate significance to the identification of the main pollution factors and water quality assessment in freshwater lake with multivariate statistical methods.

Freshwater fungi from the River Nile, Egypt	MYCOSPHERE												This study represents the first published data of freshwater fungi from the River Nile in Egypt. Knowledge concerning the geographic distribution of freshwater ascomycetes and their asexual morphs in Egypt and in the Middle East is limited. Ninety-nine taxa representing 42 sexual ascomycetes, 55 asexual taxa and two basidiomycetes were identified from 959 fungal collections recorded from 400 submerged samples. Samples were randomly collected from the River Nile, in Sohag, Egypt in the winter and summer between December 2010 and August 2014. Fifty-eight taxa (22 sexual ascomycetes and 36 asexual taxa) were collected during winter, while 60 taxa (25 sexual ascomycetes, 33 asexual taxa and two basidiomycetes) were collected in summer season. Of the 99 taxa recorded, 50 are new records for Egypt, including five new genera and 30 new species., Three new genera and ten new species were described in previous articles. Fungi recorded from the two seasons were markedly different, with only 19 species common to both winter and summer collections. Asexual fungi dominated the fungal community during the two seasons. Taxonomical placements of 33 species were confirmed by molecular data based on LSU and SSU rDNA genes. Lolia aquatica (14.2%) was the dominant fungus in both winter and summer collections. Other dominant fungi were: Ceratorhiza sp. (19.5 %) and Limnoperdon sp. (13 %). These two basidiomycetes were the most common taxa in the summer, while they were absent in the winter. Common fungi were Coleophoma emperti (9.2 %), Zopfiella latipes (8 %), Discosporium tremuloides (5.5 %), Trematophoma lignicola (5.5 %) and Ophioceras commune (5 %). Specious genera recorded from the two seasons were Dictyosporium (6 species), Monodictys-like (3 species), Aniptodera (3 species), Lolia (3 species), Podospora (3 species), Zopfiella (3 species), and two species belong to each of the following genera: Achaetomium, Annulatascus, Lentithecium, Linocarpon, Cirrenalia, Ciliochora, Coleophoma, Colletogloeum, Clohesyomyces, Periconia, Pseudorobillarda and Stagonospora.																			2077-7000	2077-7019					2016	7	6					741	756		10.5943/mycosphere/7/6/4	http://dx.doi.org/10.5943/mycosphere/7/6/4													WOS:000393041000004

Under-Ice Oxygen Depletion and Greenhouse Gas Supersaturation in North Temperate Urban Ponds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Stormwater ponds are common features in urbanized landscapes because they enhance flood reduction and nutrient retention. With shallow depths and high inputs of organic matter, these systems can be highly productive with rapid oxygen depletion when thermally stratified or ice-covered. However, most of our understanding of the biogeochemistry of stormwater ponds comes from the open water period. We explored under-ice oxygen dynamics in 20 stormwater ponds in Madison, WI (USA) that were ice covered from late December to early March to investigate the drivers of bottom water oxygen saturation and the impact on the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Winter anoxia was driven by ice transmissivity, winter nutrient concentrations, and precedent summer productivity. Oxygen depletion led to overall higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in pond surface waters. This research enhances our understanding of winter pond biogeochemistry and its links to summer productivity. In urban areas, stormwater ponds are common to help manage flooding and filter out nutrients to improve water quality in downstream water bodies. In the summer, urban ponds can experience a loss of oxygen in the bottom water, but less is known about what happens in these ponds in the winter under ice cover. We measured oxygen profiles in 20 ponds during the winter to investigate the drivers of oxygen loss in the bottom waters. We also explored the consequence of oxygen loss by measuring greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide and methane) concentrations in the surface water. Winter oxygen loss was driven by snow and ice clarity, winter nutrients, and previous summer organic matter from either algae or floating plants. Ponds with less oxygen under ice had higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the surface water. Warmer winters could increase freeze thaw cycles and decrease oxygen under ice or increase oxygen with more instances of open water. Urban ponds exhibit a range of under-ice oxygen regimes Winter anoxia is driven by ice transmissivity, nutrient concentrations, and preceding summer productivity A consequence of under-ice oxygen depletion is the accumulation of methane and carbon dioxide					Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121; GORSKY, ADRIANNA/0000-0002-5107-8188													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2024	129	6							e2024JG008120	10.1029/2024JG008120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008120													WOS:001244722600001
J	Ma, JM; Li, YF				Ma, JM; Li, YF			Interannual variation of persistent organic pollutants over the Great Lakes induced by tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The linkage between decadal monitored air concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) around the Great Lakes from 1992 to 2002 and the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the tropical Pacific was studied on a year-to-year basis. It is shown that interannual fluctuation of air concentrations of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) measured in the Great Lakes basin in spring and summer are highly correlated with the tropical Pacific SSTA. Spatial correlation patterns between the air concentrations of POPs over the Great Lakes and SSTA exhibit a feature of the characteristic SST signature associated with the occurrence of an El Nino event and SSTA forcing in atmospheric circulation teleconnections. The relations between air concentration of these POPs and the tropical Pacific SSTA are consistent with the response of midlatitude atmospheric circulation to the Pacific SSTA, showing that air concentration of the POPs in spring and summer seasons is related to tropical Pacific SSTA in preceding winter and spring months. The up to 6 month lag response of the POP air concentration to the SSTA provides a basis for forecasting the temporal trend of POPs in the atmosphere over the Great Lakes basin. The connection of the SSTA and the changes in the POP air concentration with the atmospheric circulation suggests that the atmospheric circulation associated with the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) forcing plays a major role in the reemission of POPs from sources and long-range transport of POPs in the atmosphere.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				FEB 22	2006	111	D4							D04302	10.1029/2005JD006014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JD006014													WOS:000235966700001

Beach sand and sediments are temporal sinks and sources of Escherichia coli in lake superior	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Duluth Boat Club (DBC) Beach, located in the Duluth-Superior harbor of Lake Superior, is frequently closed in summer due to high counts of Escherichia coli, an indicator of fecal contamination. However, the sources of bacteria contributing to beach closure are currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential sources of E. coli contaminating the DBC beach by using modified rep-PCR (HFERP) DNA fingerprinting. Over 3600 E. coli strains were obtained from 55 lake water, 25 sediment, and 135 sand samples taken from five transects at the DBC beach at 11 different times during the summer through fall months of 2004 and 2005. Potential sources of E. coli at this beach were determined by using a known-source DNA fingerprint library containing unique E. coli isolates from wildlife, waterfowl, and treated wastewater obtained near Duluth, MN. Amounts E. coli in the samples were enumerated by membrane filtration counting, and the presence of potentially pathogenic E. coli was determined by using multiplex PCR. E. coli counts in all samples increased during the summer and early fall (July to September). While E. coli in spring samples originated mainly from treated wastewater effluent, the percentage of E. coli from waterfowl increased from summer to fall. DNA fingerprint analyses indicated that some E. coli strains may be naturalized, and autochthonous members of the microbial community in the beach sand and sediments were examined. However, multiplex PCR results indicated that < 1% of the E. coli strains at the DBC was potentially pathogenic. Our results also suggest that wave action may influence the early colonization and homogeneous distribution of E. coli in beach sand and the subsequent release of sand or sediment-borne E. coli into lake water. Taken together, these results indicate that sand and sediment serve as temporal sources and sinks of human and waterfowl-derived E. coli that contribute to beach closures.

Here, we present various physical, chemical and biological data from a new radiocarbon-dated, 8.2 m sediment core taken from Silver Lake that spans modern through 14.8 cal ka BP. Texturally, the core varies between sandy clay, clayey sand, and sand-silt-clay, often with abrupt sedimentological transitions. These grain-size changes are used to divide the core into six lake status intervals over the past 14.8 cal ka BP. Notable intervals include a dry Younger Dryas chronozone, a wet early Holocene terminating 7.8 - 7.4 cal ka BP, a distinct mid-Holocene arid interval, and a late Holocene return to ephemeral lake conditions. A comparison to potential climatic forcings implicates a combination of changing summer - winter insolation and tropical and N Pacific sea-surface temperature dynamics as the primary drivers of Holocene climate in the central Mojave Desert.

BIOACCUMULATION AND BIOMARKER RESPONSES CAUSED BY ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES IN BOGUE BOOPS BOOPS (LINNEAUS, 1758) FROM THE BAY OF ORAN, ALGERIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In the present study we investigated the concentration of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the gills and muscles as well as the levels of Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), Catalase, GlutathioneS-Transferase (GST) and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the liver and muscles of the bogue Boops boops (Linneaus,1758) fish that were caught in the bay of Oran (Algeria). For the purpose of evaluating the toxicological risk in the abovementioned area. The concentrations of total Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( n-ary sumation DDT) was present at highly significant levels (P>0.001) compared to other OCPs, thus displayed in the following descending order: n-ary sumation DDTs > Lindane > Heptachlor. These OCPs had largely bioaccumulated in the gills compared to muscles. The PCA projection reported significant positive correlations between the concentrations of Lindane, DichloroDiphenyldichloroEthylene (DDE), DDD, DDT, and Heptachlor in gills and muscles. Seasonal variations of (OCPs) showed the highest average concentrations in the muscle and gills of fish collected mainly in Winter and Autumn (p < 0.001). The lowest concentrations were noted during the Spring and Summer periods. Significant negative correlations existed between the CAT, TBARS, GST and Lindane, n-ary sumation DDTs, and Heptachlor. The AChE (in liver and muscles) showed significant negative correlations with total DDT, with Correlation coefficient values R = 0.67, R = - 0.64, respectively (significant R > 0.5). This study underlines that the bay of Oran suffers from chemical defilement.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2023	21	2					1629	1654		10.15666/aeer/2102_16291654	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2102_16291654													WOS:000972727200015
J	Schoenebeck, CW; Hansen, MJ				Schoenebeck, CW; Hansen, MJ			Electrofishing catchability of walleyes, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, and muskellunge in Wisconsin lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We sought to determine whether electrofishing catchability was density dependent and varied with physical and biological factors for walleyes Sander vitreus, largemouth bass Micropterus sahnoides, smallmouth bass M. dolomieu, northern pike Esox lucius, and muskellunge E. masquinongy in Wisconsin lakes. Electrofishing catch rate (number of fish caught per shoreline mile) was linearly related to population density (number of fish per acre) in spring for largemouth bass, northern pike, and muskellunge and in fall for walleyes, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass. In contrast, gear saturation caused the electrofishing catch rate to be nonlinearly related (hyperstable) to population density for walleyes and smallmouth bass during spring. Catchability was higher during spring than fall for walleyes, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass. Catchability of walleyes during fall was positively related to the percentage of littoral zone, whereas catchability of largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and muskellunge was negatively related to the shoreline development index. Other physical and chemical variables failed to describe significant residual variation in catchability of any other species in any other season. We conclude that population density cannot be accurately estimated from the electrofishing catch rates of walleyes and smallmouth bass during spring. Therefore, mark-recapture methods must still be used to estimate population density if managers choose to sample those species during spring in Wisconsin lakes.

J	PEARSON, DJ				PEARSON, DJ			THE WINTERING AND MOLT OF RUFFS PHILOMACHUS-PUGNAX IN THE KENYAN RIFT-VALLEY	IBIS												Ruffs (5700) were ringed in the southern Kenyan rift valley during 1967-1979, mainly at Lakes Nakuru and Magadi. These have produced 15 recoveries outside East Africa, 14 in Siberia [USSR] between 73.degree.-154.degree. E and 1 in India. Adult males returned to Kenya mainly during Aug., and females during late Aug. and early Sept. Females greatly outnumbered males at all times. Most wintering males departed late in March and early in April, but females not until about a month later. First-year birds appeared from the end of Aug., but remained in low numbers until late Oct. or Nov. Most departed during April and May, but a few females oversummered. First-year birds typically accounted for about 25% of the wintering Nakuru females, but about 50% of those at Magadi. At both sites they accounted for a higher proportion of male birds than females. Most birds at Nakuru throughout late Aug. to May appeared to be local winterers, and many individuals remained in the area for many months each year. Retrapping indicated that approximately 60% of each season''s birds returned the following season. Adult males and most adult females commenced pre-winter wing molt before arrival, but completed most of it in Kenya. Males molted 3-4 wk ahead of females, and most finished before Dec. Females typically finished during Dec. and early Jan. Most 2nd year birds timed their pre-winter molt similarly to older adults. Suspension was recorded in over 15% of all molting birds examined. Adult pre-summer molt involved most or all of the tertials, some or all of the tail feathers, most of the inner wing coverts and the body and head plumage. It occurred mainly during Jan.-March (males) or Feb.-April (females), although tertial renewal commonly began a month earlier. Males showed no sign in Kenya of the supplementary prenuptial molt. First-year birds molted from juvenile into 1st winter body plumage during late Sept.-Nov. They underwent a pre-summer molt similar in extent and timing to that of adults, and again about a month earlier in males than females. Spring feathers acquired were often as brightly colored as those of adults. About 15% of 1st year birds renewed their outer 2-4 pairs of large primaries during Jan. to April. Adult and 1st year birds fattened before spring departure, commonly reaching weights 30-60% above winter mean. Weights of adult males peaked early in April, those of adult females early in May, and those of 1st winter females later in May. Weights were relatively high also during Aug. and Sept. This was due to the arrival of wintering birds carrying spare reserves, and also apparently to the presence of a late molting fattening passage contingent. The wing length of newly molted adults was .apprx. 3 mm longer than that of newly arrived 1st year birds, but there was no evidence of an increase in the wing length of adults with successive molts. Adult wing length decreased by 4-5 mm between the completion of 1 molt and the middle stages of the next. The migration and annual timetable of Kenyan wintering ruffs are discussed, and their molt strategy is compared with that of other Holarctic waders.																			0019-1019	1474-919X					1981	123	2					158	182		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1981.tb00922.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1981.tb00922.x													WOS:A1981LL22200003

A thermally stratified reservoir is an ideal system for investigating the interaction between factors affecting the environment and microorganism communities under spatial-temporal variation. However, few studies have focused on the effects of water stratification and mixing periods in microbial communities and nitrogen conversion. Therefore, using metagenomic sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we investigated the microbial diversity and function in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir during water stratification and mixing period. Principal component analysis indicated that the bacterial communities were mostly affected by water stratification, mainly at 10-m depths, whereas the archaea community was influenced by the entire water profile. The predominant archaeal phyla changed from Candidatus_Woesearchaeota and Euryarchaeota to Thaumarchaeota with the increasing water depth during water stratification. The stratified variations of the dominant archaeal phyla strongly reflected the seasonal changes and vertical gradient in water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Linear regression analysis indicated that variations in microbial composition altered the overall functional attributes of the communities, especially in the archaeal community. Regarding nitrogen metabolism across the whole reservoir, the number of nitrification and denitrification genes dropped in the same direction as the river flow in spring and summer, while the opposite trend was observed in autumn and winter. The functional genes of the water profiles in the transitional and lacustrine zones varied considerably except in winter. Additionally, the copies of nitrification-related genes were more during the stratification stage than during the mixing stage, whereas copies of denitrification-related genes showed the opposite trend. Overall, this study provides unique insights regarding the effects of seasonal stratification on the distribution and function of microorganisms in large-deep reservoirs, which should be considered when establishing guidelines for reservoirs management.					; huang, yuxin/JBJ-0633-2023; Yang, Zhihong/L-5024-2019	Ling, Cai/0000-0001-6198-7978; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC 1	2023	156								111128	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111128		OCT 2023											WOS:001100731700001

In this study, accumulation of heavy metals (Al, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) in the tissues (muscle, liver and gill) of sediment dwelling pike fish and in different substrates of Ladik Lake were investigated. Seasonal haematological, biochemical and histopathological parameters of the carp are also reported. In general, heavy-metal levels in water and sediment samples were found in the highest level in summer and the lowest in autumn. Histopathologic changes in the tissues of the fish (liver and gill) were at the minimum in winter while it was highest in summer. Blood biochemical parameters exhibited higher level in summer in comparison with other seasons. Al, Ba, Cr, Mn and Zn levels in the tissues of the fish were in the order gill>liver>muscle in all seasons. The levels of Cu, Fe and Pb were in the sequence liver>gill>muscle. Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn levels were determined to be in high level in the tissues of the fish with respect to the literature values. The heavy-metal levels in Ladik Lake and the fish health need to be regularly monitored for a sustainable environmental health.

J	Kaidantzis, J				Kaidantzis, Janet			The Nature of Her Business: Katherine Chandler and Female Proprietors of Summer Resorts at Lake Tahoe, 1900-1930	CALIFORNIA HISTORY												Josephine Foster was doing her very best to feminize the wilderness. Sprinkling feminine imagery throughout her 1905 article for a women's publication, she described the natural beauty of Glen Alpine Springs and encouraged her readers to discover for themselves the vacation pleasures of tramping in the mountains above Lake Tahoe, California. While Foster coaxed women into the wilds, another woman worked to keep them comfortable there. Throughout that summer, Foster hiked, climbed, and got tired, but at the end of the day, a warm bed and a hot meal awaited her because Katherine Chandler was back managing Glen Alpine Springs resort and taking good care of her guests. While women vacationing in the outdoors found freedom, female resort proprietors found opportunity. At a time when women faced limited choices in work outside the home, Katherine Chandler and other female resort proprietors found ways to turn traditional expectations of femininity to their advantage as businesswomen and outdoor enthusiasts. A collection of twenty unpublished letters written by Katherine Chandler, manager of Glen Alpine Springs to the resort's owner, Susan Gilmore Pierce, forms the basis of this research. This essay knits together several strands in the historiographies of women in business, and women in the outdoors during the late Victorian and Progressive eras while contributing to the history of early tourism at Lake Tahoe.																			0162-2897	2327-1485				FAL	2024	101	3					2	26		10.1525/ch.2024.101.3.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/ch.2024.101.3.2													WOS:001288020500002

"I will look for you, I will find you, and I will [harvest] you": Persistent hyperstability in Wisconsin's recreational fishery	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Shifting temporal or non-linear relationships between angler behavior and fish population characteristics can mask population declines or produce unexpected regulation outcomes. We tested for hyperstability in seasonal and interannual trends in angler effort, catch, and harvest rates in bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) across hundreds of Wisconsin, USA, lakes from 1990 to 2019. Higher centrarchid angling rates in summer than fall or winter and increases in winter effort suggest some policies, like seasonal restrictions, may be more effective in limiting exploitation. Hyperstability was substantial across all species and metrics and did not vary seasonally, but bluegill and yellow perch harvest rates became slightly less hyperstable over time. Our findings suggest anglers may not self-regulate or respond to management unless changes in populations or policies are conspicuous. These patterns demonstrate how angler experiences respond to policy or fish population change, and caution against reliance on fisheries-dependent data to set management goals.

Development and succession of macrophyte communities and size, diet and grazing pressure of coot (Fulica atra) populations upon macrophytes, were monitored over the seasonal cycle at ten shallow lakes of varying nutrient status, in the Norfolk Broads in eastern England. In spring, territorial breeding birds were at relatively low density and included only a small proportion of macrophytes in their diet, resulting in low grazing pressure on macrophytes. In summer, there was a significant relationship between macrophyte cover and bird density, illustrating the importance of macrophytes in the dispersion phase for birds following breeding. Macrophytes comprised the bulk of bird diet where they were available and the consumption of macrophytes was up to 76 fold higher than in spring. However, losses to grazing in both periods were negligible when compared to potential growth rates documented in the literature. Grazing experiments at two biomanipulated lakes confirmed that birds were not responsible for limiting macrophytes during the spring colonisation phase or in the summer growth period. During the period of autumnal senescence and over the winter months where some macrophyte species remain available, e.g. as developed individuals or dormant buds, grazing by birds may conceivably have an impact on the development and structure of macrophyte populations in subsequent growing seasons. The relative importance of bird grazing compared to other factors limiting the development of macrophytes in shallow lakes is discussed in the light of other experimental studies.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 17	1997	342						241	255		10.1023/A:1017007911190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017007911190													WOS:A1997WZ13900027

The purpose of our study was to estimate the ecological status of the temperate Caygoren Reservoir (2007-2009) using the Q((r)) FG composition metric, and to test whether it is able to follow the main structuring of the physical and chemical parameters studied. The main occurring coda were codon C (Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutzing, Stephanodiscus neoastraea Hakansson and Hickel), codon T (Gloeotila subconstricta (G.S. West) Printz, Mougeotia sp.), codon X2 (Cryptomonas pyrenoidifera Geitler, Plagioselmis nannoplanctica (H.Skuja) G.Novarino, I.A.N.Lucas and S.Morrall), codon K (Aphanocapsa holsatica (Lemmermann) G.Cronberg and J.Komarek, Aphanothece clathrata West and G.S. West), and codon S1 (Planktothrix sp.). The seasonal succession of phytoplankton displayed the lake-like coda series of Y (winter) -> C (spring) -> K/S1 (summer) -> T (fall) in each year, which demonstrated well the transitional behavior of reservoirs between lake and river ecosystems. The FG compositions showed high relationships with water temperature, ammonia, phosphate, and light availability in this temperate reservoir, where the Q((r)) index estimated reliable water quality states between hypertrophic and oligotrophic conditions.

We studied the autumn migration and body condition of molecularly sexed Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus and Sedge Warblers Acrocephalus schoenobaenus (211 and 208 ind., respectively) at a stopover site on Lake Druzno, Northern Poland, in 2008. Immature male Reed Warblers were caught significantly later than females (median dates 9 days later), but in the Sedge Warbler, both sexes of immatures migrated at about the same time. Adult males and females of both species did not differ in their time of migration. Adult and immature males of both species were larger (wing length and body mass) than females. In both species, fat reserves were similar in both sexes of both age classes. Adults of both sexes of Reed and Sedge Warbler were generally caught earlier than immatures. In both species, the body mass and fat reserves of immatures were generally less than in adults. The autumn protogyny of immature Reed Warblers may allow smaller females to limit competition with bigger males during migration and at the wintering grounds. In the Sedge Warbler, which tends to match its migration to peak of occurrence of superabundant food at stopover sites, both sexes gain an advantage from migrating at the same time. Since part of the measured wing length variation in both species was explained by sex differences, temporal trends in wing length recorded at stopover sites should be interpreted with caution.

(Copepoda: Calanoida) in Lake Glubokoe	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Seasonal changes in the abundance, age composition, vertical distribution, lipid and protein body content, development rates in the older copepodids (CIV and CV) and reproduction characteristics were studied in Eudiaptomus graciloides in the mesotrophic Lake Glubokoe (Moscow region). Two periods of reproduction were observed: spring and late summer/autumn. The older copepodids, having accumulated lipid reserves during phytoplankton bloom, descended into the meta- and hypolimnion at the beginning of the summer. These copepods did not feed, but instead consumed their lipid reserves. A considerable delay in development (up to 40-60 days) of CIVs and CVs was found. The descended CIVs and CVs incubated under ambient temperature developed 4-5 times slower than their surface counterparts, while temperature dependence could only account for a 2-fold slow down. The descended copepods are believed to form a summer resting stock. In October, females began to produce resting eggs. The period of switching from subitaneous to resting egg production was very brief, not longer than 2-3 weeks. The percentage of subitaneous eggs produced in mid-October tended to increase when females were exposed to an increased photoperiod. At the beginning of February, latent eggs kept in a cooling container in the darkness started hatching. This process could be speeded up under natural photoperiod and increased temperature The overwintering population consisted largely of adults. Thus, E.graciloides includes three types of diapause in the life cycle: resting eggs, summer resting stage at CIV-CV, and overwintering adults.

In this study, we employed a multi-stage plug-flow bioreactor and spectroflu-orometric indices to characterize the seasonal variations in DOM composition and lability across Poyang Lake (PY) and Lake Taihu (TH), two large freshwater lakes in China with distinct hydrological seasonality. Our findings showed that the export of floodplain-derived organics and river-lake interaction led to a remarkable increase in terrestrial aromatic and humic-like DOM with high molecular weights and long turnover times in PY. Consequently, the labile fraction was extremely low (average LDOC% of 3%) during the rising-to-flood season (spring and summer). Conversely, autochthonous production in TH considerably enriched semi-labile (average SDOC% of 26%) and biodegradable DOM (average BDOC% of 34%) during the phytoplankton bloom to post-bloom season (summer and autumn). This was reflected by the accumulation of low-light-absorbing and protein-like components with high biological and fluorescence indices. In the dry and non-bloom season (winter), the better preservation of humic substances maintained the high molecular weight and humic degree of DOM in PY, while the decay of aquatic plants strengthened autochthonous production, resulting in a similar BDOC% of PY samples (23%-34%) to TH samples (18%-33%). We further applied partial least squares regression using DOM optical indices as predictive proxies, which generated a greater prediction strength for BDOC% (R-2 = 0.80) compared to SDOC% (R-2 = 0.57) and LDOC% (R-2 = 0.28). The regression model identified aromaticity (SUVA254) as the most effective and negative predictor and low molecular weight (A250/A365) as the highly and positively influential factor. Our study provides new evidence that the seasonality of DOM lability profiles is regulated by the trade-off between flow-related variation and phytoplankton production, and presents an approach to describe and predict DOM lability across freshwater lakes.

It is revealed that station Tory is subject to strong smoke from forest fires in the spring-summer period, which largely determine the spectral course of aerosol optical depth. The distribution of aerosol particles in size showed that in the spring and summer months the proportion of subfraction aerosol is high. In addition, the paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of the ultrafine aerosol obtained using an aerosol diffusion spectrometer in the spring-summer period in Lake Baikal coastal zone.					; Zayakhanov, Alexander/HHS-3435-2022; Starikov, Alexey/HII-5080-2022; Zhamsueva, Galina/HHS-3414-2022; Dementeva, Ayuna/ABF-8654-2021; Balzhanov, Tumen/HII-4952-2022; Tsydypov, Vadim/V-1440-2018	Dementeva, Ayuna/0000-0002-1426-6817; Zayakhanov, Alexander/0000-0003-4112-2437; Zhamsueva, Galina/0000-0003-3213-5252													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-3942-3				2020	11560								115606O	10.1117/12.2575533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2575533													WOS:000652167500238

Modelling the long term impact of climate change on the carbon budget of Lake Simcoe, Ontario using INCA-C	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study presents a process-based model of dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]) in catchments draining into Lake Simcoe, Ontario. INCA-C, the Integrated Catchment model for Carbon, incorporates carbon biogeochemical processes in a terrestrial system with hydrologic flow paths to simulate watershed wide [DOC]. The model successfully simulates present-day inter-annual and seasonal [DOC] dynamics in tributaries draining catchments with mixed or contrasting land cover in the Lake Simcoe watershed (LSW). The sensitivity of INCA-C to soil moisture, hydrologic controls and land uses within a watershed demonstrates its significance as a tool to explore pertinent environmental issues specific to the LSW. Projections of climate change under A1B and A2 SRES scenarios suggest a continuous monotonic increase in [DOC] in surface waters draining into Lake Simcoe. Large variations in seasonal DOC dynamics are predicted to occur during summer with a possibility of displacement of summer [DOC] maxima towards winter and a prolongation of summer (DOC] levels into the autumn. INCA-C also predicts possible increases in dissolved inorganic carbon in some tributaries with rising temperature suggesting increased CO2 emissions from rivers as climate changes.

J	Wright, KR				Wright, Kyle R.			Count trends for migratory Bald Eagles reveal differences between two populations at a spring site along the Lake Ontario shoreline	PEERJ												The recovery of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucophalus), after DDT and other organochlonne insecticides were banned in the United States, can be regarded as one of the most iconic success stories resulting from the Endangered Species Act. Interest remains high in the recovery and growth of the Bald Eagle population. Common to evaluating growth and recovery rates are counts at nesting sites and analyses of individuals fledged per season. But this is merely one snapshot that ignores survival rates as eagles grow to maturity. By analyzing indices from migration counts, we get, a different snapshot better reflecting the survival of young birds. Different populations of Bald Eagles breed at different sites at different times of the year. Typical migration count analyses do not separate the populations. A separation of two distinct populations can be achieved at spring count sites by taking advantage of the tendency for northern summer breeding birds to migrate north in spring earlier than southern winter breeding birds who disperse north later in spring. In this paper I analyze migratory indices at a spring site along Lake Ontario. The analysis shows that eagles considered to be primarily of the northern summer breeding population showed an estimated growth rate of 5.3 +/- 0.85% (SE) per year with 49% of eagles tallied in adult plumage, whereas the migrants considered to be primarily of the southern breeding population had an estimated growth rate of 14.0 +/- 1.79% with only 22% in adult plumage. Together these results argue that the populations of southern breeding Bald Eagles are growing at a substantially higher rate than northern breeding eagles. These findings suggest that, aggregate population indices for a species at migration counting sites can sometimes obscure important differences among separate populations at any given site and that separating counts by time period can be a useful way to check for differences among sub-populations.																			2167-8359					MAY 17	2016	4								e1986	10.7717/peerj.1986	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1986								27231647					WOS:000376575200002
J	AMIN, OM				AMIN, OM			CESTODA FROM LAKE FISHES IN WISCONSIN - THE ECOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF PROTEOCEPHALUS-AMBLOPLITIS PLEROCERCOIDS IN THEIR FISH INTERMEDIATE HOSTS	JOURNAL OF THE HELMINTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												Seventeen species of fish in 5 families were infected with parenteric plerocercoids of Proteocephalus ambloplitis in 2 southeastern Wisconsin eutrophic lakes. The records from Carpiodes cyprinus and Moxostoma erythrurum are new. Prevalence and intensity were considerably higher in the land-locked Silver Lake compared to the river-connected Tichigan Lake. Plerocercoids were present in various hosts during all seasons but were most prevalent and numerous during the spring; subsequent decreases of plerocercoids in bass were attributed to parenteric recruitment into bass gut. Recruitment via the nonparenteric route is believed to have a significant role in the P. ambloplitis suprapopulation cycling in Wisconsin, particularly when fish other than bass, e.g., Amia calva, are involved as definitive hosts. Accordingly, recruitment does not have to occur only once a year, and the critical May temperatures of 7-12.degree. C would not be required under all circumstances. Parenteric plerocercoids were localized mostly in the intestinal mesenteries during the spring but shifted to the gonads, liver, and spleen in summer and autumn. Some pathological observations are noted including the unilateral hypertrophy of infected ovaries in centrarchid fishes.																			1049-233X					JUL	1990	57	2					113	119																WOS:A1990DT06200004

This study utilized metagenomic sequencing combined with flow cytometry to analyze pathogen concentrations and antibiotic resistance in a typical effluent-receiving river. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was employed to assess the microbial risks of pathogens. The results indicated obvious spatial-temporal differences (i.e., summer vs. winter and effluent vs. river) in microbial composition. Microcystis emerged as a crucial species contributing to these variations. Pathogen concentrations were found to be higher in the river than in the effluent, with the winter exhibiting higher concentrations compared to the summer. The effluent discharge slightly increased the pathogen concentrations in the river in summer but dramatically reduced them in winter. The combined effects of cyanobacterial bloom and high temperature were considered key factors suppressing pathogen concentrations in summer. Moreover, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance of pathogens in the river was inferior to that in the effluent, with higher levels in winter than in summer. Three high-concentration pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were selected for QMRA. The results showed that the risks of pathogens exceeded the recommended threshold value. Escherichia coli posed the highest risks. And the fishing scenario posed significantly higher risks than the walking scenario. Importantly, the effluent discharge helped reduce the microbial risks in the receiving river in winter. The study contributes to the management and decision-making regarding microbial risks in the effluent-receiving river.

J	Yoo, JC; D'Odorico, P				Yoo, JC; D'Odorico, P			Trends and fluctuations in the dates of ice break-up of lakes and rivers in Northern Europe: the effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The existence of an ice cover has important effects on the streamflow conditions as well as on the hear transfer between water bodies and the overlying atmosphere, This paper investigates the effects of climate variability on the termination of the ice season in the Baltic region. In particular, trends and fluctuations observed in the cryophenological records from this region are analyzed in detail, searching for possible connections with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO seems to affect mostly the late-winter temperature (January-March) with a significant impact also on the mid-spring (April-May) period, when the air temperature is strongly correlated to the ice dates. A regional analysis shows the existence in the series of winter temperature (JFM) of the same fluctuations as the winter NAO. The same components can be found in the cryophenological records and (partly) in the series of spring temperature. Nevertheless, both ice phenology and spring temperature show the existence of a very well defined trend that is not detectable in the series of winter NAO at time scales of a century or longer, This leads to the conclusion that winter NAO has still a weak, though significant, effect on the regime of spring temperature in the Baltic region and explains the most significant fluctuating components embedded in the cryophenological records. However it is argued that other climatic forcings, related to CO2-induced regional and global warming, acting at the end of the ice season, are able to induce pronounced trends in the regime of spring temperature and have an important impact on the cryosphere leading to the earlier occurrence of ice break-up observed in the last several decades.

Trophic interactions amongst the plankton in the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The trophic interactions between bacteria, phytoplankton, nanoflagellates (2-20 mu m), microzooplankton (20-200 mu m) and mesozooplankton (200-2000 mu m) were investigated in winter and summer in the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary, Eastern Cape. During winter the phytoplankton community was dominated by microphytoplankton (20-200 mu m) and during summer by nano- and picophytoplankton. Among the heterotrophic components of the plankton, the nanoflagellates were identified as the most important consumers of bacteria and small < 20 mu m phytoplankton cells. During both winter and summer the larger heterotrophic organisms, particularly mesozooplankton, resulted in a reduced impact of the nanoflagellates on both the bacteria and phytoplankton, indicating that the larger heterotrophs were preying upon the nanoflagellates. This resulted in a decrease in the predation impact of these organisms on the bacteria during both winter and summer, and on the phytoplankton in summer. This result is consistent with expectations of predator-prey cascades. The presence of the larger heterotrophs therefore mediates interactions between primary bacterivores, nanoflagellates, and bacteria in this estuary.

Methane production and ebullition in a shallow, artificially aerated, eutrophic temperate lake (Lake Elsinore, CA)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Methane is an important component of the gases released from lakes. Understanding the factors influencing the release is important for mitigating this greenhouse gas. The volume of methane (CH4) and other gases in sediments, and the rate of CH4 ebullition, were determined for an artificially aerated, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake in Southern California. Gas volume was measured at 28 sites in July 2010, followed by monthly sampling at 7 sites through December 2011. Gas volumes measured in July 2010 at the 28 sites exhibited a complex dependence on sediment properties; the volume of CH4 and other gases was negligible in very coarse-textured sediment with low water and organic carbon contents. Gas volumes increased strongly with increased silt content, and were highest in sediments with intermediate water contents (60 to 70%), organic carbon contents (2 to 3%) and depths (approximately 4 m). Methane was the dominant gas collected from sediment (80 to 90%), while carbon dioxide comprised roughly 2 to 3% of sediment gas in the lake. Gas sampling during cool winter months revealed very low or undetectable volumes of gas present, while sediment gas volumes increased markedly during the spring and early summer months, and then declined in late summer and fall. The rate of CH4 ebullition, quantified with an echosounder, also varied markedly across the lake and seasonally. High rates of ebullition were measured at all 7 sites in July 2011 (up to 96 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), while the rates were >50% lower in September and negligible in December 2010. Ebullition rates were inversely correlated with depth and most other sediment properties, but strongly positively correlated with sand content. No simple relationship between ebullition rate and sediment gas volume across the set of sites was found, although ebullition rates at individual sites were strongly related to gas volume.

Temporal and Spatial Variations of Phytoplankton Community Structure in Lake Erhai, a Chinese Plateau Lake, with Reference to Environmental Factors	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Temporal and spatial variations of phytoplankton community in Lake Erhai were investigated from May 2010 to April 2011. A total of 124 species belonging to 8 phyla and 72 genera were recorded, among which Chlorophyta (74) ranked the first, followed by Bacillariophyta (24) and Cyanophyta (17). Total phytoplankton density ranged from 27.7 x 10(5) to 442.1 x 10(5) cells/L, with annual average value of 196.3 x 10(5) cells/L. The range of total phytoplankton biomass was between 0.68 mg/L and 3.25 mg/L, with annual average value of 2.31mg/L. In winter and spring, the dominant species were Fragilaria capucina and Aulacoseira granulata, while it changed into Cyclotella meneghiniana, Microcystis (M. aeruginosa, M. wesenbergii and M. viridis) and Psephonema aenigmaticum in summer and autumn. Phytoplankton biomass in the southern zone of the lake was significantly higher than those in the northern and middle zones of the lake. Two-way ANOVA showed that the influences of temporal (F = 43.75, P < 0.001), spatial variability (F = 14.85, P < 0.001), and their interaction (F = 2.74, P < 0.001) on phytoplankton biomass in Lake Erhai were all significant. Redundancy analysis revealed that water temperature, transparency, nutrient concentration and crustacean zooplankton were main environmental factors affecting phytoplankton community structure.																			1067-4136	1608-3334				JUL	2019	50	4					352	360		10.1134/S1067413619040179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1067413619040179													WOS:000478004100006

The organisms were divided into 2 categories: 1 in which the majority of the population occurred in the upper 1 cm of substrate (Pontoporeia, naidids, chironomids, cyclopoids, harpacticoids, cladocerans, turbellarians, ostracods, rotifers, sphaeriids and gastropods) and 1 in which the majority of the population occurred deeper (immature tubificids without hair setae, Stylodrilus heringianus, enchytraeids, nematodes and tardigrades). The vertical distribution of these infaunal forms showed a marked seasonal variation. They were found in the superficial sediments in the spring, but deeper in the sediments in the autumn. This trend coincided with the seasonal occurrence of a detrital layer that overlay the sandy substrate in the spring, but was absent in the autumn.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1981	11	1					87	96		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01244.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01244.x													WOS:A1981LC48100007

This study analyzed the influences of soil and terrain on soil moisture temporal stability (relative difference of soil moisture-delta and standard deviation of delta - S-delta) on two contrasting land use hillslopes [tea garden (TG) and bamboo forest (BF)] in the hilly area of Taihu Lake Basin, China. Soil moisture temporal stabilities were considered at two depths (0.1 and 0.3 m) and during eight different periods (entire, dry, wet, rain, spring, summer, fall and winter periods). Results showed that for each land use and soil depth, values of d in summer were largely deviated from those during the entire period, while values of S-delta after rain storms were strongly deviated from those during the entire period. Correlation coefficients between soil/terrain and d were generally greater on the BF hillslope (ranged from 0.35 to 0.70) than on the TG hillslope (ranged from 0.30 to 0.55). This suggested that soil moisture distribution was more spatially organized on the BF hillslope than on the TG hillslope. This can be attributed to that the management practices disturbed and mixed the soils on the TG hillslope, which made the soil moisture more randomly distributed. The controls on S-delta substantially varied with season, soil depth and land use. On the TG hillslope, soil/terrain had weak correlations with S-delta, while on the BF hillslope, rock fragment, slope and elevation had decent correlation with S-delta. This varied controlling factors of S-delta on different hillslopes, period and soil depth suggested that spatial distributions of S-delta were influenced by the occurrence of subsurface preferential flow. Findings of this study suggested that soil moisture temporal stability and its controlling factors were land use type and time period dependent.

White-throated sparrows calibrate their magnetic compass by polarized light cues during both autumn and spring migration	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The interaction and hierarchy of celestial and magnetic compass cues used by migratory songbirds for orientation has long been the topic of an intense debate. We have previously shown that migratory Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, use polarized light cues near the horizon at sunrise and sunset to recalibrate their magnetic compass. Birds exposed to a +/- 90 deg. shifted artificial polarization pattern at sunrise or sunset recalibrated their magnetic compass, but only when given full access to celestial cues, including polarized light cues near the horizon. In the current study, we carried out cue conflict experiments with white-throated sparrows, Zonotrichia albicollis, during both spring and autumn migration in a transition zone between the species' breeding and wintering areas on the south shore of Lake Ontario. We show that white-throated sparrows also recalibrate their magnetic compass by polarized light cues at sunrise and sunset. Sunrise exposure to an artificial polarization pattern shifted relative to the natural magnetic field or exposure to a shift of the magnetic field relative to the natural sky both led to recalibration of the magnetic compass, demonstrating that artificial polarizing filters do not create an anomalous, unnatural orientation response. Our results further indicate that there is no evidence for a difference in compass hierarchy between different phases of migration, confirming previous work showing that polarized light cues near the horizon at sunrise and sunset provide the primary calibration reference both in the beginning and at the end of migration.					; Muheim, Rachel/D-3521-2009	Muheim, Rachel/0000-0002-2079-6443; 													0022-0949	1477-9145				NOV 1	2009	212	21					3466	3472		10.1242/jeb.032771	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.032771								19837888					WOS:000270889100018
J	Rowe, DK; Konui, G; Christie, KD				Rowe, DK; Konui, G; Christie, KD			Population structure, distribution, reproduction, diet, and relative abundance of koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis) in a New Zealand lake	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND												The koaro population of Lake Rotoaira was investigated during September 1998 and April 1999. Abundance (mean CPUE) in fyke nets was lower on the eastern side of the lake than on the western side where underground springs occurred and rocky substrate predominated. Adults were 54-135 mm long and the sex ratio varied with size, with 68% of the smaller fish (60-70 mm) being male and 79% of the larger fish (70-135 mm) being female. All fish over 60 mm were sexually mature with 60% having either well developed or ripe gonads by September. Few females (12.5%) had spawned by September whereas most (83%) were spent by April, so spawning occurred over summer months. Abundance in the lake dropped by over 70% between September and April and this seasonal decline is consistent with a summer emigration of many adult koaro into inlet springs and streams to spawn in lake tributaries during summer and autumn. Overall, the diet of lake-dwelling koaro was dominated by purse caddis larvae (Paroxythira sp.), but small fish (<70 mm) also fed extensively on Daphnia, whereas larger ones (>90 mm) fed on Odonata larvae, snails, and common bullies. Although the introduction of rainbow trout in 1906 reduced the koaro population of Lake Rotoaira, they were still relatively abundant in the lake in the early 1970s. However, by 1999, no koaro were found in the sublittoral zone of Lake Rotoaira, and trapping in the littoral revealed a relatively low abundance relative to other comparable lakes. These data, plus anecdotal information on abundance, suggest that they are now much less abundant than in the 1970s.																			0303-6758					JUN	2002	32	2					275	291		10.1080/03014223.2002.9517695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014223.2002.9517695													WOS:000176963000005
J	ANDERSON, GC				ANDERSON, GC			SEASONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 2-SALINE LAKES IN WASHINGTON	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The limnology of two highly saline lakes in Washington was studied in relation to the physical and chemical conditions which influence the growth and distribution of phytoplankton. The lakes were sampled at frequent intervals for a period of more than a year in 1950 and 1951. Morphometric conditions were determined, and routine sampling included measurements of temperature, transparency, oxygen, pH, alkalinity, phosphate, chlorophyll, and quantitative samples of phyto-plankton. Lake Lenore, the less saline of the two (T.D.S. 14 g/liter), is shallow and was unstratified during the investigation. Dissolved nutrients were high and showed erratic variations during the summer. The phytoplankton population was taxonomically simple and was made up mainly of two species of diatoms[long dash]Amphora sp. which formed the spring bloom, and Chaetoceros elmorei which made up the late summer bloom. Soap Lake is relatively deep, meromictic, and saline (T.D.S. 35 g/liter). Temperature conditions were dichothermic, and the nutrient content was high, especially in the monimolimnion. A winter maximum and a summer minimum was observed in the phytoplankton population, and a change in the biota has been noted during dilution of the lake in recent years. Indication of grazing by zooplankton was found in both lakes.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1958	3	1					51	68		10.4319/lo.1958.3.1.0051	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1958.3.1.0051													WOS:A1958WY35800006

Occupancy, movement, and behaviour of namew (lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens) in an intact river in Canada	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												Most sturgeon populations are imperilled and living in fragmented rivers. Here, we studied namew (lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens), fish important to Ililiwak (Moose Cree Peoples), in the North French River: a free-flowing, intact river in Kit Aski Nahnuun (the Moose Cree Homeland) in northern Ontario, Canada. This study was co-created alongside members of Moose Cree First Nation and used acoustic telemetry to passively track 20 tagged namew over 6 yr (2016-2022). Namew occupied the entire monitored river reach: about 45 km. Namew used 2 overwintering areas and occupied more overall river sections during spring and summer (out of 6 total seasons often used by Ililiwak). We did not detect namew moving upstream or downstream during freeze-up and winter. Generally, namew showed the greatest acceleration and travelled the longest distances during spring and summer, and they occupied shallower water during summer at lower water levels and deepest waters during freeze-up. We found an interaction between season and diurnal period, where namew occupied shallower depths and had higher acceleration at dawn and night relative to morning and afternoon in most seasons; dusk behaviour was variable among seasons. However, this pattern was absent in spring, when namew showed no diurnal pattern in acceleration and were in shallower water during morning and afternoon. Diurnal patterns were less pronounced, but detectable, during ice-affected seasons. This river provides year-round habitat for namew, and our data reveal distinct patterns of namew occupancy, movement, and behaviour in a free-flowing, intact river. Our work is an example of successfully co-creating research that addresses both scientific and community priorities.

J	Traunspurger, W				Traunspurger, W			Distribution of benthic nematodes in the littoriprofundal and profundal of an oligotrophic lake (Konigssee, National Park Berchtesgaden, FRG)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Although the nematodes are the most abundant and species richest organisms in the littoral and profundal of the benthos of lakes, little is known about their distribution and species composition. Tn this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of the nematode fauna of an alpine, oligotrophic lake was studied over a one-year period. In the littoriprofundal and profundal of Konigssee, nematodes comprise respectively 59% and 75% of the meiobenthic organisms, with a mean abundance of 578 individuals/100 cm(2) in the littoriprofundal, and of 375 individuals/100 cm(2) in the profundal. Differences in abundance between the depths examined, however, were considerable in the littoriprofundal (15 m, 20 m and 30 m) but not in the profundal (60 m, 120 m and 190 m). Seasonal variation in abundance was significant at all depths, with the exception of 190 m water depth. Minimum nematode abundances were recorded in winter or spring and maximum values in the summer or autumn. The highest abundances were recorded at 15 m and the lowest at 190 m water depth. The fresh weight biomass of nematodes ranged from 0.03 mg/100 cm(2) to 1.2 mg/100 cm(2) depending on the season and water depth. Monhystera paludicola and Eumonhystera filiformis were the abundant of the 71 and 60 species found respectively in the littoriprofundal and profundal. Monhystera paludicola was found predominantly in 15 m, 20 m, 120 m and 190 m, whereas the abundance of Eumonhystera filiformis was very similar at all depths. About 70-84% of the nematodes were found in the upper 2 cm of the sediment and overall 95% of all individuals in the first five centimetres. Nematodes occurred deeper in the sediment at 15 m water depth where the proportion of nematodes in the top 2 cm layer was only 62% and about 90% in the first 5 cm. The remainder was found between 5 cm and 20 cm sediment depth. The proportion of nematodes in the top sediment layer was highest in summer/autumn. Deposit-feeders were the most common feeding-type, followed by epistrate feeders. There was also a remarkable proportion of omnivores and predators, especially at 30 m and 60 m water depth. The study shows that the structure of freeliving nematodes of an oligotrophic lake is also in the deeper regions very dependent on seasonal, bathymetric and vertical distribution.

J	Nocera, JJ; Taylor, PD				Nocera, JJ; Taylor, PD			Behavior of post-nest failure and non-breeding Common Loons during the breeding season	WILSON BULLETIN												Common Loon (Gavia immer) breeding, pre-migratory, and wintering behavior has been well described, but no previous author has characterized failed and non-breeding loon behavior during the summer breeding season. We quantified the summer behavior of non-breeding and failed breeding loons from 15 lakes in Kejimkujik National Park (Nova Scotia, Canada) and the Lepreau watershed (New Brunswick, Canada). Time-activity budgets and event quantifications were used to describe behavioral state and event patterns. The behavior of failed and non-breeders in summer is similar to that described for pre-nesting, pre-migratory, wintering, and breeding loons (except those With young chicks) with foraging the predominant behavior and peering the predominant event. We propose that the behavioral regimen of adult loons is relatively constant throughout the year, with the exception of a two-week period following chick hatching when adults brood their young.

The aerosols are classified into five types: Dust, Mixture, non-absorbing fine-model aerosols (NA), slightly-absorbing fine-model aerosols (SA) and moderately-absorbing fine-model aerosols (MA), according to fine-mode fraction (FMF) and single-scattering albedo (SSA), respectively. The aerosol types in Taihu lake show strong seasonal periodicity, with NA and SA being the dominating aerosols (about 80% frequency). The Dust and Mixture aerosols occur mainly in spring and NA are mostly observed in summer. On the contrary, SA has the highest frequency in winter and the lowest in summer. Trajectory Cluster and frequency of different aerosol types are acquired by the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The aerosols in Taihu Lake are mainly the emissions from the local and surrounding areas, with some being transmitted from the east coastal regions and the northern regions.

Quartz Lake is naturally acidic, pH ca. 5.3, due to local geologic sources of S. By contrast, Hi Lo Lake has a pH of ca. 6.0 decreasing to 5.4 during storm episodes in the spring and fall due to cation dilution and increased levels of organic acids. Total Al levels were as high as 156 mu g L(-1) in Hi Lo Lake and 127 mu g L(-1) in Quartz Lake during high flow spring and fall, whereas summer Al concentrations were 4 and 2 fold lower in Hi Lo and Quartz lakes, respectively. The peak Al concentrations were approximately 4 to 5 times greater than the median total Al levels for Washington Cascade lakes observed by the EPA. Variable flow paths and organic acids are hypothesized to control Al solubility, and the acid-base chemistry of Hi Lo Lake. However, at Quartz Lake sulfate weathering in the groundwater zone appeared most important for Al chemistry controls.																			0049-6979					DEC	1993	71	3-4					377	390		10.1007/BF00480556	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00480556													WOS:A1993MT74000010

Baseline data on the nutritional condition of Mysis populations are necessary to evaluate potential impacts of recent, dramatic changes in the lower food webs of lakes Michigan and Huron. Information on lipid and fatty acid content can reveal patterns of health and physiological condition of mysids, including inferences on availability and quality of food. We sampled Mysis populations in the two lakes in spring and late summer/early fall 2008 and analyzed total lipid content and fatty acid profiles to describe Mysis nutritional condition. On average, adult Mysis in Lake Huron had lower total lipids and elevated concentrations of the fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid compared with Lake Michigan. although differences were not always significant. Results suggest that Lake Huron Mysis could have been starving during spring 2008. (C) 2011 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gerhardt, S; Boos, K; Schink, B				Gerhardt, Simone; Boos, Katja; Schink, Bernhard			Uptake and release of phosphate by littoral sediment of a freshwater lake under the influence of light or mechanical perturbation	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The littoral sediment of Lake Constance, Germany, is influenced by varying light conditions and mechanical perturbation. This study documents the effects of these changes on phosphate exchange between sediment and lake water. The concentration of total phosphate measured in sediment-near water was 50 +/- 50 mu g total P L-1 in early spring, and 16 +/- 9 mu g total P L-1 in late summer. In the interstitial water of the sediment, the dissolved orthophosphate content was 17 +/- 2 mg PO4 - P L-1 in both profundal and littoral sediment, and the total phosphate was 163 +/- 4 mg total P L-1 and 79 +/- 2 mg total P L-1 in profundal and littoral sediment, respectively. The release and uptake of phosphate compounds was measured with sediment cores incubated under gently flowing water under the influence of light, erosion, and sedimentation. In all experiments, phosphate was released to the overlying water by sediment sampled in late summer, but was taken up from the overlying water by sediment sampled in early spring Illumination of the sediment surface enhanced the uptake of orthophosphate and total phosphate in early spring. and decreased the release of total phosphate in late summer. Erosion of the sediment surface did not enhance phosphate release or uptake. After exposure to light or dark and after erosion of surface sediment, both uptake and release were nearly constant over time. By resuspension of the eroded sediment, more orthophosphate was released form sediment sampled during early spring than from sediment sampled during late summer, but eh amount of total P released by the sediment was about the same at both times of the year. During the first hours after re-sedimentation of the eroded sediment, the phosphate release form sediment sampled in late summer was enhanced and the phosphate uptake from sediment sampled in early spring was reduced. Our results document that the uptake and release of phosphate in littoral sediments is influenced by the season and differs between early spring and late summer. On the short time scale, the specific rates of uptake and release are influenced by light-dark changes and by mechanical perturbation.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2010	69	1					54	63		10.4081/jlimnol.2010.54	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2010.54													WOS:000275919600006

S.; Shah, Rouf Ahmad			Weathering and anthropogenic influences on the water and sediment chemistry of Wular Lake, Kashmir Himalaya	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents a study on the Wular Lake which is the largest fresh water tectonic lake of Kashmir Valley, India. One hundred and ninety-six (196) water samples and hundred (100) sediment samples (n = 296) have been collected to assess the weathering and Anthropogenic impact on water and sediment chemistry of the lake. The results showed a significant seasonal variability in average concentration of major ions being highest in summer and spring and lower in winter and autumn seasons. The study revealed that lake water is alkaline in nature characterised by medium total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. The concentration of the major ion towards the lake central showed a decreasing trend from the shore line. The order of major cations and anions was Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and HCO3 (-) > SO4 (2-) > Cl-, respectively. The geochemical processes suggested that the chemical composition lake water is mostly influenced by the lithology of the basin (carbonates, silicates and sulphates) which had played a significant role in modifying the hydrogeochemical facies in the form of Ca-HCO3, Mg-HCO3 and hybrid type. Chemical index of alteration values of Wular Lake sediments reflect moderate weathering of the catchment area. Compared to upper continental crust and the post-Archean Shale, the sediments have higher Si, Ti, Mg and Ca contents and lower Al, Fe, Na, K, P, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu content. Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and US Environmental Protection Agency sediment quality standards indicated that there is no pollution effect of heavy metals (Zn, Mn, Pb, Ni and Co).The study also suggested that Wular Lake is characterised by both natural and anthropogenic influences.					; Sheikh, Javed/AAW-2822-2021; Gavali, Ravindra/B-4404-2011; Jeelani, Gh/KII-0203-2024	Gavali, Ravindra/0000-0002-2164-9349; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2014	71	6			SI		2837	2846		10.1007/s12665-013-2661-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2661-z													WOS:000331970100027

Effects of road salt deicers on an urban groundwater-fed kettle lake	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Road salt deicers significantly influence the chemistry and physical mixing of urban lakes, even causing transition from dimixis to monomixis or meromixis. In this study, the water column geochemistry of Asylum Lake, a primarily groundwater-fed, eutrophic kettle lake in urban Kalamazoo, MI, was monitored for over a year to determine the extent of road salt deicer influence on the lake chemistry and the physical mixing of the lake. Water column samples from the surface to the deepest part of Asylum Lake were analyzed monthly for nineteen months for a suite of parameters including dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, temperature, alkalinity, Fe2+, Mn2+, orthophosphate, total NH4+, alkalinity, total sulfide, Cl-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+. During the study period, spring mixing was never observed and a nearly complete fall turnover was observed only in November 2013. The hypolimnion of Asylum Lake was always hypoxic or anoxic and redox-stratified, with seasonal development of suboxic and sulfidic zones, which were disrupted in fall and winter following partial fall turnover and subsequent ice cover. This study suggests that road salt deicers have caused Asylum Lake to transition from dimixis to meromixis or periodic monomixis with significant consequences for biogeochemical cycles in the lake waters.

An assessment of the potential and impacts of winter water banking in the Sokh aquifer, Central Asia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The dynamics of artificial recharge of winter surface flows coupled with increased summer groundwater use for irrigation in the Sokh aquifer (Central Asia) have been investigated. Water release patterns from the giant Toktogul reservoir have changed, as priority is now given to hydropower generation in winter in Kyrgyzstan. Winter flows have increased and summer releases have declined, but the Syr Darya River cannot pass these larger winter flows and the excess is diverted to a natural depression, creating a 40 x 10(9)m(3) lake. A water balance study of all 18 aquifers feeding the Fergana Valley indicated the feasibility of winter groundwater recharge in storage created by summer abstraction. This modeling study examines the dynamics of the process in one aquifer over a 5-year period, with four scenarios: the current situation; increased groundwater abstraction of around 625 million (M) m(3)/year; groundwater abstraction with an artificial recharge of 144 Mm(3)/year, equivalent to the volume available in low flow years in the Sokh River; and with a larger artificial recharge of 268 Mm(3)/year, corresponding to high flow availability. Summer surface irrigation diversions can be reduced by up to 350 Mm(3) and water table levels can be lowered.					; Karimov, Akmal/AAE-5949-2022	Biradar, Chandrashekhar/0000-0002-9532-9452; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2009	17	6					1471	1482		10.1007/s10040-009-0444-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0444-0													WOS:000269013500011

Built in 1982, the Stre & zcaron;evo Reservoir serves several purposes, including irrigation, water supply, and hydropower generation. The research project investigated the seasonal and vertical variation in zooplankton abundance and biomass as well as the influence of environmental factors. Sampling was conducted seasonally (spring, summer, and autumn) in 2010 and 2011 across the longitudinal profile (epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion) of the reservoir at three sampling stations: the inflow of the & Scaron;emnica River, a central station in open water, and a site near the dam. The Stre & zcaron;evo Reservoir is characterized by significantly pronounced seasonal and vertical temperature stratifications. The species diversity of the zooplankton was low, with only 21 taxa identified. Seasonal oscillations in abundance were statistically significant, with maximum values in the summer period and minimum values in spring. The Shannon diversity index displayed the lowest diversity values in the autumn, in the hypolimnion, and the highest values in the summer, in the metalimnion. The RDA analysis showed that temperature was the most important predictor of zooplankton abundance distribution, followed by Chl a concentration and TN. According to the Zooplankton Index of Quality Assessment (Zoo-IQ), during the investigated period the reservoir had good water quality in all three studied seasons, as well as through the whole profile. Overall, the study highlights the importance of zooplankton as an indicator of water quality and provides valuable insights into the ecological status of the Stre & zcaron;evo Reservoir. The novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive examination of the interconnected dynamics affecting reservoir ecology, particularly as the present study is the first to perform such an analysis for the Stre & zcaron;evo Reservoir. It highlights the impacts of thermal stratification on biochemical processes, the seasonal variations in dissolved oxygen and phosphorus levels due to phytoplankton activity, and the influences of temperature on zooplankton diversity and abundance. Furthermore, it introduces the Zoo-IQ index as an innovative tool for assessing water quality through zooplankton analysis, emphasizing its relevance as an early indicator of ecological changes in freshwater systems. Moreover, this multi-faceted approach underscores the complexity of reservoir ecosystems and the importance of proactive management strategies to the mitigation of water quality fluctuations. This study underlines the need for continuous monitoring and proactive management strategies to address the aging of reservoirs.

In recent years, the lake ecosystem and the drinking water safety of the surrounding residents have been seriously affected by the increase in human activities and wastewater discharge in the basin, and the impact of riverine input on the lake water quality needs to be focused on. In this study, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measured in summer and autumn were analysed in parallel. Three fractions of CDOM from Lake Bosten were identified: terrestrial humic fraction Cl tyrosine-like fraction C2 and tryptophan-like fraction C3. The effect of river input on the DOM of Lake Bosten was also analysed based on Pearson correlation. The results show that river input's influence on Lake Bosten's DOM differs between seasons and is directly related to the seasonal changes in river water quality. In summer, the water entering the lake from the Kaidu River mainly comes from winter snowmelt and carries a large amount of terrestrial humus into the lake, while in autumn, it is mainly glacial meltwater. The content of terrestrial humus is reduced as the flow into the lake increases, showing that the overall DOM concentration near the estuary is higher in summer and lower in autumn. The three components Cl, C2 and C3 were found to be more abundant in the western part of the lake where the Kaidu River and the Yellow Water Ditch enter the lake, and the three components were similarly affected by seasonality. The correlation between DOM and conductivity was also carried out at sampling points near the mouth of the Kaidu River and other areas. It was found that the influence of external river input on the DOM of Lake Bosten was mainly concentrated near the mouth of the river, and the relationship between DOC and CDOM in the area near the mouth of the river was significant so that the CDOM could be inferred by remote sensing before estimating the DOM content. The study of the influence of river inputs on the composition of dissolved organic matter in Lake Bosten in different seasons is of great importance to protect the lake's ecological environment and improve the lake's water quality.

An acute increase in the flushing rate of the lake during spring inhibited cyanobacterial biomass accumulation. During this transient oligotrophic period, which was characterized by abundant lake snow particles, the plankton food web was an inverted biomass pyramid (low autotrophic biomass and high heterotrophic biomass). Prokaryotes played a key role in these changes (cyanobacteria during periods of autotrophy and bacteria during periods of heterotrophy). In summer and autumn, toxic cyanobacterial blooms developed, and the microbial loop was weak. The microbial loop was weak because the heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nanociliates decreased to undetectable densities during the summer, when larger bacterivores (rotifers and small cladocera) were abundant. Toxic blooms may have a dual effect on heterotrophic nanoplankton: negative during the first bloom and postbloom period and positive during a following toxic bloom.

Response of Submerged Macrophyte Communities to External and Internal Restoration Measures in North Temperate Shallow Lakes	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Submerged macrophytes play a key role in north temperate shallow lakes by stabilizing clear-water conditions. Eutrophication has resulted in macrophyte loss and shifts to turbid conditions in many lakes. Considerable efforts have been devoted to shallow lake restoration in many countries, but long-term success depends on a stable recovery of submerged macrophytes. However, recovery patterns vary widely and remain to be fully understood. We hypothesize that reduced external nutrient loading leads to an intermediate recovery state with clear spring and turbid summer conditions similar to the pattern described for eutrophication. In contrast, lake internal restoration measures can result in transient clear-water conditions both in spring and summer and reversals to turbid conditions. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these contrasting restoration measures result in different macrophyte species composition, with added implications for seasonal dynamics due to differences in plant traits. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed data on water quality and submerged macrophytes from 49 north temperate shallow lakes that were in a turbid state and subjected to restoration measures. To study the dynamics of macrophytes during nutrient load reduction, we adapted the ecosystem model PCLake. Our survey and model simulations revealed the existence of an intermediate recovery state upon reduced external nutrient loading, characterized by spring clear-water phases and turbid summers, whereas internal lake restoration measures often resulted in clear-water conditions in spring and summer with returns to turbid conditions after some years. External and internal lake restoration measures resulted in different macrophyte communities. The intermediate recovery state following reduced nutrient loading is characterized by a few macrophyte species (mainly pondweeds) that can resist wave action allowing survival in shallow areas, germinate early in spring, have energy-rich vegetative propagules facilitating rapid initial growth and that can complete their life cycle by early summer. Later in the growing season these plants are, according to our simulations, outcompeted by periphyton, leading to late-summer phytoplankton blooms. Internal lake restoration measures often coincide with a rapid but transient colonization by hornworts, waterweeds or charophytes. Stable clear-water conditions and a diverse macrophyte flora only occurred decades after external nutrient load reduction or when measures were combined.

J	Munroe, JS				Munroe, Jeffrey S.			Distribution, evidence for internal ice, and possible hydrologic significance of rock glaciers in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Mapping at a scale of 1:5000 identified 395 rock glaciers in the Uinta Mountains, Utah. The majority of these have areas < 20 ha, although the largest covers 97 ha. Rock glaciers have a mean elevation of 3285 m above sea level (range of 2820 to 3744 m above sea level) and exhibit a preference for northerly aspects. Sixty (15%) have a tongue-shaped morphology, whereas 335 (85%) are lobate features protruding from talus along valley walls. Tongue-shaped rock glaciers are found at significantly higher elevations and receive considerably less direct solar radiation each year than lobate rock glaciers. Winter ground temperatures atop representative rock glaciers drop to between -3 degrees C and -5 degrees C. This result, combined with similar to 0 degrees C water discharging in the summer and water ages >1 year, suggests that at least some of these landforms contain buried ice. Late summer water discharge from two rock glaciers exhibits higher pH and significantly elevated concentrations of some ions compared with lake water, consistent with ablation of internal ice after melting of winter snow-pack is complete. Although the amount of water discharging from individual rock glaciers may be small, the aggregate discharge from all rock glaciers and talus could constitute a significant component of streamflow in late summer and fall.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JUL	2018	90	1					50	65		10.1017/qua.2018.24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2018.24													WOS:000438045900005

Heavy metals were accumulated at varying levels and clearly distinguishable in different tissues of Cyprinus carpi from Yenicaga Lake. The distribution pattern of Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, Cd, Sn, and Pb followed the order liver > gill > muscle but that for Mn, Fe, Zn, and Ba the order gill > liver > muscle. Concentrations of Zn, Al, Fe, Ba, Mn and Cu, in particular, were very high in the tissues studied. The BAF values of Al, Fe, Cu, Zn and Mo were remarkably high in all of the carp tissues investigated. In particular, Pb and As results from the muscle tissue of the carp were not within the safe limits for human consumption. In the present study, the effects of season on the accumulation of heavy metals in the muscle, liver, and gills of the carp were also determined, and differences were found for the majority of heavy metals (p < 0.05). In general, the concentrations of the tested heavy metals were observed to be higher in spring and summer but lower in autumn and winter.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2012	21	7					1786	1792																WOS:000306887100011

Quantifying seasonal variation in total phosphorus and nitrogen from prairie streams in the Red River Basin, Manitoba Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A three-year study (2010, 2013 and 2014) was conducted to identify temporal and spatial patterns in phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and loads in 11 sub-watersheds of the Red River Valley, Manitoba, Canada in relation to human activity on the landscape. Discharge exhibited a strong seasonal pattern in all sub-watersheds with high discharge during snowmelt, generally lower discharge with rainfall-induced peaks during spring, summer and fall, and low or no discharge during winter. Consistent with the hydrologic pattern, nutrient concentrations were highest during snowmelt such that 62% of the annual TP load and 67% of the annual TN load were delivered during the 12-18 day snowmelt period. Partial least squares regression analysis indicated that land use activities such as fertilizer application, livestock density and sewage were critical factors influencing TP and TN concentrations. In contrast, physical aspects such as water temperature and discharge were the primary determinants of TP and TN loads. The finding that stream water nutrients concentrations are associated with human activity on the landscape whereas nutrient loads are largely influenced by hydrologic events suggests that different types of beneficial management practices are needed for protection of instream ecological processes negatively affected by high nutrient levels versus reduction of nutrient export to downstream receiving bodies such as Lake Winnipeg.

J	Jiang, DB; Tian, ZP; Lang, XM				Jiang, Dabang; Tian, Zhiping; Lang, Xianmei			Mid-Holocene net precipitation changes over China: model-data comparison	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Many efforts have been made to reconstruct the moisture conditions over China during the mid-Holocene, approximately 6000 calendar years ago. However, most of them have been performed at the single site level or local scale, and the nationwide distribution of the mid-Holocene precipitation and net precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation) changes from both proxy data and simulations remains unclear. Here we first selected 36 out of 51 climate models participating in the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) for their demonstrable ability to simulate the baseline climate and for the availability of evaporation data. Our analysis of the ensemble mean results of the 36 models shows that the mid-Holocene annual precipitation, evaporation, and net precipitation were 3.0%, 0.9%, and 6.9% more than the baseline period, respectively, and seasonally all three variables decreased in boreal winter and spring but increased in boreal summer and autumn on the national scale. For that period, both the pattern and magnitude of the above changes differed between the models and the subregions, and the interactive ocean effect had little impact overall on the country. Compared with the wetter-than-present climates derived from the records at 64 out of 69 sites across China, the models agreed qualitatively with the multi-proxy data in most parts of China, except Xinjiang and the areas between the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow River valleys, where drier-than-baseline climates were obtained from the 36 models.

J	Vystavna, Y; Hejzlar, J; Kopácek, J				Vystavna, Yuliya; Hejzlar, Josef; Kopacek, Jiri			Long-term trends of phosphorus concentrations in an artificial lake: Socio-economic and climate drivers	PLOS ONE												European freshwater ecosystems have undergone significant human-induced and environmentally-driven variations in nutrient export from catchments throughout the past five decades, mainly in connection with changes in land-use, agricultural practice, waste water production and treatment, and climatic conditions. We analysed the relations among concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in the Slapy Reservoir (a middle reservoir of the Vltava River Cascade, Czechia), and socio-economic and climatic factors from 1963 to 2015. The study was based on a time series analysis, using conventional statistical tools, and the identification of breaking points, using a segmented regression. Results indicated clear longterm trends and seasonal patterns of TP, with annual average TP increasing up until 1991 and decreasing from 1992 to 2015. Trends in annual, winter and spring average TP concentrations reflected a shift in development of sewerage and sanitary infrastructure, agricultural application of fertilizers, and livestock production in the early 1990s that was associated with changes from the planned to the market economy. No trends were observed for average TP in autumn. The summer average TP has fluctuated with increased amplitude since 1991 in connection with recent climate warming, changes in thermal stratification stability, increased water flow irregularities, and short-circuiting of TP-rich inflow during high flow events. The climate-change-induced processes confound the generally declining trend in lake-water TP concentration and can result in eutrophication despite decreased phosphorus loads from the catchment. Our findings indicate the need of further reduction of phosphorus sources to meet ecological quality standards of the EU Water Framework Directive because the climate change may lead to a greater susceptibility of the aquatic ecosystem to the supply of nutrients.

J	Nelson, DM; Dortch, Q				Nelson, DM; Dortch, Q			Silicic acid depletion and silicon limitation in the plume of the Mississippi River: Evidence from kinetic studies in spring and summer	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The surface distributions of dissolved silicic acid, chlorophyll and diatom abundance were measured in the plume of the Mississippi River and adjacent waters during spring (late April and early May 1993) and summer (July 1992). In spring, the time of maximum river now, there was an intense diatom bloom with a mean diatom abundance of 1.5 x 10(7) cells l(-1), more than an order of magnitude higher than in summer. Mixing curves of silicic acid concentration ([Si(OH)(4)]) versus salinity indicate that biological uptake within the river plume removed >99% of the Si(OH)(4) supplied by the river in spring and 80 to 95% in summer. In spring [Si(OH)(4)] was occasionally depleted to <0.2 mu M-among the lowest values ever reported from the ocean-with extensive depletion to <0.5 mu M over the shelf. In summer [Si(OH)(4)] was less severely depleted; the lowest measured was 0.93 mu M and all others were greater than or equal to 2.4 mu M. Si-30 kinetic experiments were performed during both spring and summer to measure the degree to which the rate of Si uptake by the natural diatom assemblages was limited in situ by substrate availability. In spring the dependence of the specific uptake rate (V) on extracellular [Si(OH)(4)] conformed much more closely to the Michaelis-Menten saturation function than has been observed in past studies. Strong dependence of V on [Si(OH)(4)], was observed throughout the most Si(OH)(4)-depleted (<0.5 mu M) region, where V was limited to 12 to 45% of the diatom assemblages' maximum uptake rate (V-max). Half-saturation concentrations for Si uptake (K-s) averaged 0.85 mu M (range = 0.48 to 1.71; n = 7) in spring, with the lowest values equal to the lowest previously reported for natural diatom assemblages. There was only 1 station in summer where V was limited by [Si(OH)(4)], and at that station K-s was 5.3 mu M-quite high in comparison with previous studies. At stations where V was Limited by [Si(OH)(4)], in both spring and summer, Chaetoceros spp, were numerically dominant; where there was no Si limitation other diatoms, usually Skeletonema costatum, dominated. The data thus indicate strong Si limitation in spring, with diatom assemblages well adapted to low [Si(OH)4], but Little or no Si limitation in summer. Historical data suggest that coastal Si(OH)(4) depletion and Si limitation may be recent phenomena in the northern Gulf of Mexico, resulting from increasing [NO3-] and decreasing [Si(OH)(4)] in the Mississippi River during the past 30 to 50 yr.

Corallobothrium fimbriatum, C. giganteum, Ophiotaenia fragilis, Proteocephalus sp. (Cestoda), and Polylekithum ictaluri (Trematoda) are reported from Ictalurus punctatus, and Triaenophorus nodulosus plerocecoids from Catostomus commersoni. All records are new to southeastern Wisconsin. Channel catfish appeared to be the major host of C. giganteum. Corallobothrium recruitment occurred during all seasons, but was maximal during autumn. Development, maturation, prevalence, and intensity of infection increased during spring and summer. Infection with Corallobothrium was not associated with host sex or size; no posterior migration was observed. The white sucker appears to be the more common host of T. nodulosus in North America. The seasonality of Acanthocephalus dirus (Acanthocephala) in 9 common fish hosts was similar to that of Corallobothrium. Infections in 1977-1979 were, however, very light and fecundity unusually low. The spring population was compared with those from other years, e.g., 1984, and from a riverine habitat, the Pike River.																			1049-233X					JUL	1991	58	2					255	260																WOS:A1991GD36300018

The obtained results of trace element concentrations in the Indus River were higher than the acceptable drinking water standards by WHO. The nitrate concentration ranges from 5.2 to 59.6 mg l(-1), turbidity ranges from 3.00 to 63.9 NTU, total suspended solids and ammonium ions are below the detection limit (<0.05). In the liver, highest dry wt trace elements (mu g/g) such as Cr (4.32), Pb (7.07), Zn (58.26), Cu (8.38), Mn (50.27), and Fe (83.9) for the Labeo rohita; and Tor Putitora has significantly greater accumulated concentration (Cr, Pb, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe) in muscle and liver than did Labeo rohita species. Additionally, lower number of macroinvertebrates were recorded during the monsoonal season than pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. Local communities surrounded by polluted environments are more probably to consume more fish and expose them to higher concentrations of toxic trace elements (lead and copper).

However, underlying factors influencing the succession or coexistence of cyanobacteria, especially filamentous ones, remain poorly understood. Lake Honghu, a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance with degrading aquatic ecological quality, served as a case study to elucidate the intricate relationship between environmental changes and cyanobacterial dynamics. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in the dominance of filamentous cyanobacteria, marked by high spatiotemporal variability in community structure. This dominance of filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria is attributed to a decrease in the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus and their capacity to utilize organic phosphorus in phosphorus-deficient conditions. Species-specific density variations were linked to diverse environmental factors, with total nitrogen or total phosphorus concentration remaining as a crucial factor influencing dominant cyanobacterial density fluctuations. The dominance of low-temperature-tolerant Aphanizomenon and Pseudanabaena was evident in spring and winter, whereas Dolichospermum and Cylindrospermopsis , which prefer higher temperatures, thrived in summer and autumn. Additionally, non-algal turbidity and heterogeneity can potentially alter the competitive outcome among filamentous cyanobacteria or foster coexistence under conditions of elevated temperatures and nutrient limitation. This study predicts that filamentous cyanobacteria may spread and persist in lakes spanning a wide trophic range.

Connecting past, present, and future trends of hydraulic and phosphorus loading in the Bay of Quinte tributaries, Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The Bay of Quinte watershed, located on the northeastern shore of Lake Ontario, Canada. Special focus is placed on the Napanee River and Wilton Creek catchments, where the presence of a subterranean network of conduits that facilitate groundwater -surface water interactions is conducive to an increase in the delivery of nutrients during storm events and can exacerbate the risk of eutrophication. Study focus: Development of a rigorous modelling framework that can advance our understanding of past and present trends of streamflow and tributary phosphorus (P) concentration and loads. We also analyze future streamflow rates and P export trends in order to guide the long-term watershed management in the area. Our analysis is carried out through a comprehensive combination of data -driven and process -based models. Novel hydrological insights for the region: Retrospective analysis provides evidence of a recent increase in the impact of nonpoint-source P pollution. General Circulation Models suggest a future increase in both temperature minima and maxima relative to present conditions (2002 -2018). Precipitation projections are indicative of increased frequency of occurrence of high extreme precipitation events during the summer and mid -fall, when the Bay of Quinte is more susceptible to undesirable ecological shifts. Our study predicts a seasonality shift in the streamflow, with the spring freshet occurring earlier in the year accompanied by higher flow rates in the local creeks for the winter and early spring. We also examined the relationship between precipitation and streamflow across varying levels of flow regulation. Our analysis indicates that our predictive capacity declines with increased flow regulation as well as when streamflow rates are predicted by contemporaneous precipitation values.					; Arhonditsis, George/AAI-7897-2020	Neumann, Alex/0000-0003-1590-8516; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; Javed, Aisha/0000-0002-8516-6370														2214-5818				JUN	2024	53								101818	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101818													WOS:001250225300001

The results revealed that most of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences belonged to Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, which accounted for more than 58% of the total bacterial abundance. Species richness and evenness indices were highest in surface water from summer samples (January 2020), followed by winter (July 2019) and spring samples (September and November 2019). Results also showed that the highest concentrations of sulfate (SO4-2), phosphate (P), ammonia (NH3), and nitrate (NO3-) were detected in November 2019 and January 2020 compared with samples collected in July and September 2019 (P < 0.05). Principal component analysis suggests that physicochemical factors such as pH, DO, temperature, and NH3 are the most important environmental factors influencing spatial and temporal variations in the community structure of bacterioplankton. At the genus level, 18.3% and 9.9% of OTUs in the July and September 2019 samples, respectively, were assigned to Planktothrix, while 14.4% and 20% of OTUs in the November 2019 and January 2020 samples, respectively, were assigned to Microcystis. In addition, PICRUSt metabolic analysis revealed increasing enrichment of genes in surface water associated with multiple metabolic processes rather than a single regulatory mechanism. This is the first study to examine the temporal dynamics of bacterioplankton and its function in Billings Reservoir during the winter, spring, and summer seasons. The study provides comprehensive reference information on the effects of an artificial habitat on the bacterioplankton community that can be used to interpret the results of studies to evaluate and set appropriate treatment targets.

J	Qiu, HM; Geng, JJ; Ren, HQ; Xu, ZY				Qiu, Huimin; Geng, Jinju; Ren, Hongqiang; Xu, Zhaoyi			Phosphite flux at the sediment-water interface in northern Lake Taihu	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Phosphite (H2PO3-, HPO32-, +3 valence), a reduced form of phosphorus (P), has been widely detected in water environments. The role of phosphite in the P biogeochemical cycle has not been investigated systematically and quantitative results on phosphite fluxes are lacking. In this study, intact sediment core simulation was employed to measure the flux of phosphite at the sediment-water interface in northern Lake Taihu. Phosphite fluxes (mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) ranged from -38.21 +/- 1.14 to 7.10 +/- 2.18, with an annual average of -4.72 +/- 10.40. On the whole, phosphite migrated from water into sediment and the sediment was primarily a sink. The highest seasonal negative phosphite fluxes (mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) occurred in winter (-10.44 +/- 18.63), followed by summer (-8.04 +/- 5.61) and spring (-2.61 +/- 4.17). In autumn, phosphite flux was 2.20 +/- 4.07. Higher annual average negative fluxes of phosphite (mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) appeared in site ZSB (-12.70 +/- 17.96), which contained the highest content of total soluble P. The average yearly migration of phosphite in Lake Taihu from water to sediment was estimated to be (4.04 +/- 8.88) x 10(6) mol y(-1). The transfer of phosphite from water into sediment usually occurs in winter may due to the season's natural tendency to create more favorable conditions for phosphite biogeochemical reactions. Phosphite fluxes showed significant negative correlations with the original phosphite concentration in water (r = -0.840, p < 0.01), as well as organic matter (r = -0.720, p < 0.01) and phosphate bound to Ca (Ca-Ps) (r = -0.632,p < 0.05) in sediment. These results indicate that microbiological processes and P species bound to Ca may play an important role in the P redox cycle. No significant correlations between phosphite fluxes and dissolved oxygen or oxidation-reduction potential were observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	GRAHAM, JM; GRAHAM, LE				GRAHAM, JM; GRAHAM, LE			GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION OF BANGIA-ATROPURPUREA (ROTH) C-AG (RHODOPHYTA) FROM THE LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES	AQUATIC BOTANY												Bangia atropurpurea (Roth) C. Ag. is an unbranched filamentous red alga which has recently entered the Laurentian Great Lakes. It is found in a band 5-10 cm wide above the waterline in rocky littoral areas. Field observations of its seasonal and spatial distribution indicate a bimodal pattern of maximum biomass in spring and autumn with reduced biomass persisting in summer. Field observations suggest that it should have a high irradiance optimum and tolerate warm temperatures. Measurements of net photosynthesis and respiration were made at 48 combinations of irradiance and temperature. Optimum conditions were 20.degree. C and 750 .mu.E m-2 s-1 at which net photosynthesis was 11.55 mg O2 g-1 h-1. Optimum irradiance remained at or above 750 .mu.E m-2 s-1 at all temperatures examined. Respiration rates increased with both temperature and prior irradiance. A study of the effects of 125 combinations of temperature, irradiance and photoperiod revealed that monospore production is favored by high temperatures and increasing daylength. The combined effect of rising temperatures and increasing daylengths caused progressively more filaments to produce monospores and contributes to the summer decline in biomass.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				AUG	1987	28	3-4					317	331		10.1016/0304-3770(87)90008-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(87)90008-8													WOS:A1987J832600008

The helminth fauna of cormorants from the brackish water habitat was far richer (30 species) than in those from freshwater lakes (18 species) and strongly depend on season and age of the host. The values of diversity index strongly varied in relation to habitat and host age with clear seasonal differences in the value of diversity index, i.e., its value increased over time in adults from the brackish water habitat and decreased in those from the freshwater lakes. The number of helminths in adult and immature birds varied, depending on the season and habitat: in the brackish water habitat, the overall percentage of helminths was higher in spring than in summer, while in the freshwater habitat a higher proportion of helminths was recorded in summer. During spring, in the brackish water habitat, we observed a higher level of aggregation (for all groups of helminths) than in autumn. The opposite pattern was found in the freshwater habitat. However, this regularity was typical of adult birds only. In immature hosts, the level of aggregation was not predictable and varied among the higher taxa. Our study clearly showed that processes determinate diversity, structure, richness, and patterns of aggregation in helminth assemblages of avian hosts are multi-origin and highly complex.

J	Zhu, SY; Wu, YL; Ma, XS				Zhu, Shengyuan; Wu, Yinglei; Ma, Xiaoshuang			Deep Learning-Based Algal Bloom Identification Method from Remote Sensing Images-Take China's Chaohu Lake as an Example	SUSTAINABILITY												Rapid and accurate monitoring of algal blooms using remote sensing techniques is an effective means for the prevention and control of algal blooms. Traditional methods often have difficulty achieving the balance between interpretative accuracy and efficiency. The advantages of a deep learning method bring new possibilities to the rapid and precise identification of algal blooms using images. In this paper, taking Chaohu Lake as the study area, a dual U-Net model (including a U-Net network for spring and winter and a U-Net network for summer and autumn) is proposed for the identification of algal blooms using remote sensing images according to the different traits of the algae in different seasons. First, the spectral reflection characteristics of the algae in Chaohu Lake in different seasons are analyzed, and sufficient samples are selected for the training of the proposed model. Then, by adding an attention gate architecture to the classical U-Net framework, which can enhance the capability of the network on feature extraction, the dual U-Net model is constructed and trained for the identification of algal blooms in different seasons. Finally, the identification results are obtained by inputting remote sensing data into the model. The experimental results show that the interpretation accuracy of the proposed deep learning model is higher than 90% in most cases with the fastest processing time being less than 10 s, which achieves much better performance than the traditional supervised classification method and also outperforms the single U-Net model using data of whole year as the training samples. Furthermore, the profiles of algal blooms are well-captured.

J	Dulski, T; Kozlowski, K; Ciesielski, S				Dulski, Tomasz; Kozlowski, Krzysztof; Ciesielski, Slawomir			Habitat and seasonality shape the structure of tench (Tinca tinca L.) gut microbiome	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Tench (Tinca tinca L.) is one of the most valued species of the Cyprinidae. This species is commercially important and has been intensively domesticated in recent years. To avoid excessive production losses, the health of farm fish must be maintained. Characterization of the tench gut microbiome can help achieve this goal, as the gastrointestinal microbiome plays an important role in host health. As part of this characterization, investigating the influence of the environment and season will help to understand the interrelationship between host and gut microbiota. Therefore, our aim was to use high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to profile the gut microbiome of tench. We studied two populations in summer and autumn: wild tench living in a lake and tench living in a pond in a semi-intensive fish farm. We found that, in the gut microbiome of all fish, the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Together, these phyla constituted up to 90% of the microbial communities. The abundance of Candidatus Xiphinematobacter differed significantly between lake and pond fish in summer, but not in autumn. In pond tench, Methylobacterium abundance was significantly lower in summer than in autumn. Mean Shannon, Chao1 indices and observed OTU's indicated that microbial biodiversity was greater in the gut of lake fish than in that of pond fish. Betadiversity analysis showed significant divergence between groups with both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices. Principal coordinates analysis revealed that more of the variance in microbial diversity was attributable to environment than to season. Although some of the diversity in lake tench gut microbiota could be attributable to feeding preferences of individual fish, our results suggest that environment is the main factor in determining gut microbiome diversity in tench.					; Ciesielski, Slawomir/HJI-2080-2023; D, Tomasz/AAR-3531-2020; Ciesielski, Slawomir/B-4569-2013	Kozlowski, Krzysztof/0000-0001-8043-4885; Ciesielski, Slawomir/0000-0002-9084-9782; Dulski, Tomasz/0000-0001-6330-5168													2045-2322					MAR 10	2020	10	1							4460	10.1038/s41598-020-61351-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61351-1								32157130					WOS:000563379300016

Two overwintering populations and 5 spring cohorts were recognized over 2-yr field observations performed at 4-15 day intervals. There was no luck in following possible cohorts in mid-summer and autumn. The specific growth rate of the post-embryonic stage determined varied between 0.001 and 0.16 (day-1) depending upon the surrounding water temperature, and each individual growth showed an almost exponential pattern. Average size of newly hatched individuals was .apprx. 2.1 mm in body length and was consistent regardless of the difference of seasons; however, the average mature size was highly temperature-dependent, ranging between 7.6 and 12.0 mm for males and 8.1 and 13.5 mm for females.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1983	5	3					377	392		10.1093/plankt/5.3.377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/5.3.377													WOS:A1983QN07500006
J	Suomi, J				Suomi, Juuso			Extreme temperature differences in the city of Lahti, southern Finland: Intensity, seasonality and environmental drivers	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES												The extremes of month-specific spatial temperature differences were studied for a first time in the high-latitude city of Lahti and its surroundings in southern Finland. During the 2-year observation period (6/14-5/16), the largest momentary temperature difference, 11.1 degrees C, was detected in February, and the smallest, 6.2 degrees C, in April. The impacts of various environmental factors during the extreme situations were estimated by site-specific analysis of the warmest and coldest observation sites and a stepwise multiple linear regression model including all the 8 observation sites. The extreme temperature differences were characterised by inversions especially in winter and spring, the warmest site being the hill-top location in Kivistonmaki. In summer the role of urban heating was more apparent, and the temperature was the highest in the relatively low-lying city centre. In autumn the heating impact of the relatively warm Lake Vesijarvi caused the largest temperature differences with harbour as the warmest site. The weather during all of the momentary extreme situations was calm and in the majority of the situations also clear. The impact of cloud cover was less critical than that of wind speed in reducing spatial temperature differences. The momentary extreme situations existed at night or at dawn, with one exception: only in January, during the cold weather period dominated by high pressure, the delayed break of inversion in the vicinity of Lake Vesijarvi caused the extreme temperature difference to exist in the afternoon, reflecting for its part the substantial stabilising impact of seasonal ice cover on Lake Vesijarvi.

VERTICAL FLUXES OF PARTICULATE MATTER - SEASONALITY AND VARIATIONS ACROSS THE CHEMOCLINE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Vertical fluxes of particulate organic matter were measured with sediment traps above and below the chemocline of Big Soda Lake to define the seasonality of sinking losses from the mixolimnion and determine the effectiveness of the chemocline (pycnoline) as a barrier to the sinking of biogenic particles. Seasonality of sedimentation rates reflected seasonal changes in the community of autotrophs. During summer-autumn, when production is dominated by autotrophic bacteria, vertical fluxes were small: .simeq. 100 mg C m-2 d-1 and .simeq. 0.5 mg Chl a m-2 d-1. Following the winter diatom bloom, vertical fluxes increased markedly: .simeq. 570 mg C m-2 d-1 and 23 mg Chl a m-2 d-1. The bulk of the seston (> 80%) and particulate carbon (.simeq. 65%) sinking to the chemocline passed through it, showing that this very sharp density discontinuity does not effectively retard the sinking of particulate matter. However sinking losses of particulate carbon were generally small (.simeq. 10%) relative to previous measures of primary productivity, indicating that the mixolimnion is a zone of efficient carbon cycling. Exceptions occurred following the winter bloom when sinking losses were a larger fraction (.simeq. 40%) of productivity.					; Cloern, James/C-1499-2011	Cloern, James/0000-0002-5880-6862; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1987	32	4					815	824		10.4319/lo.1987.32.4.0815	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.4.0815													WOS:A1987K372000004
J	Fitzgerald, DG; Clapp, DF; Belonger, BJ				Fitzgerald, DG; Clapp, DF; Belonger, BJ			Characterization of growth and winter survival of age-0 yellow perch in southeastern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Reduced growth and increased winter mortality are possible mechanisms for poor recruitment of age-0 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in southeastern Lake Michigan. To assess the role of growth variability on recruitment of age-0 yellow perch, we quantified length-by-date and abundance during 1996-2002. Analyses revealed significant differences in length among years and sites. To resolve spatial trends, we contrasted the 1998 cohort from southeastern Lake Michigan with conspecifics from populations located within and beyond the Lake Michigan watershed. These analyses identified significant differences in length; trends suggested that the capacity for growth in the cohort from southeastern Lake Michigan was similar to these other populations. To characterize winter survival for the 1998 age-0 cohort, otoliths from age-1 perch in 1999 were used to back-calculate length (BCL) from the previous autumn. The BCL distribution was significantly larger than the 1998 distribution, but analyses led to the inference that this age-0 cohort experienced little mortality during the winter of 1998-99. We used a regression model to quantify risk of winter starvation for the 1998 cohort, using 1981-2001 winter water temperatures from southeastern Lake Michigan. This analysis suggested that risk of starvation for the 1998 cohort across this period was low (1.0-4.4%). Back calculation and regression analyses allow us to reject the hypothesis that reduced growth led to a high rate of winter mortality for the 1998 cohort. If we extrapolate our findings to past cohorts, the results would be similar unless these fish were significantly smaller than the 1998 cohort. Variation in age-0 length, growth, or, winter mortality failed to fully explain yellow perch recruitment patterns in southeastern Lake Michigan. We hypothesize that factors acting before the juvenile stage is sampled during summer are shaping recruitment; resolving this requires further, stage-specific studies.																			0380-1330						2004	30	2					227	240		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70341-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70341-X													WOS:000223086800001

Fifteen species were identified, but only Keratella cochlearis was consistently found at each station, it usually was the most abundant (> 50% of total rotifers). Marked differences were found among sites; stations 1 and 2, those nearest to the dam, showed greatest rotifer densities in spring and autumn. Station 4, that nearest to the inflowing rivers, had its highest rotifer abundance in summer. Station 8 had the highest mean density but the least marked seasonal changes in rotifer numbers. The impoundment water dynamics and the relative locations within the lake (distance from the dam or from the rivers) are suggested as determinants for different rotifer assemblages and, probably, for most other planktonic organisms.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	114	1					67	74		10.1007/BF00016602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016602													WOS:A1984TE75000008

This study targeted 15 PAH compounds. Vapor-phase PAH compositions were dominated by the more volatile PAHs, relative to the particle phase. On average, 76% of the total (gas + particulate) PAH concentration was in the vapor phase. Average total PAH concentration was 298 +/- 418 ng/m(3). The large seasonal concentration fluctuation was attributed to residential heating, vaporization, industrial activities, and meteorological conditions. The measured average seasonal concentrations were 55 +/- 40, 187 +/- 202, 645 +/- 588 and 148 +/- 132 ng/m(3) for summer, fall, winter, and spring, respectively. The partitioning of PAHs between gas and particle phases was investigated employing the Junge-Pankow model. Plots of log gas/particle partition coefficient (K-p) versus log liquid vapor pressures (P-L(o)) had reasonable correlations for individual samples. Experimentally determined K-p values were compared with the result obtained using absorption ( octanol - air partition coefficient [K-OA]) into aerosol organic matter and adsorption (K-SA + K-OA) onto soot carbon models. Experimentally determined K-p values were generally in the same range with the ones obtained from the models.

J	HANSSON, LA; GRANELI, W				HANSSON, LA; GRANELI, W			EFFECTS OF WINTER HARVEST ON WATER AND SEDIMENT CHEMISTRY IN A STAND OF REED (PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An investigation of the effects of repeated winter harvest [for thatching and as an energy source] and removal of dry reed culms on water and sediment chemistry was made in a shallow lake [Sweden] dominated by closed, monospecific reed stands. The O2 concentration and redox potential in the water, as well as temperature, showed regular diurnal fluctuations inside the reed stands. NH4+ and NO3- + NO2 did not exhibit diurnal fluctuations and differences between a harvested and an unharvested reed area were small. Molybdate reactive phosphorus (MRP) concentration was higher in the unharvested area. Because the winter harvest caused an almost doubling of shoot production compared to the unharvested area, net addition of reed litter (leaves, stubble and culms) to the sediment of the harvested area was similar to that of the unharvested area. Removal of reed culms in winter probably has the largest effect on microclimate in spring, and the rate of mineralization and reducing intensity in the substrate are not immediately affected. Significantly higher summer standing crop of reed after harvest may have caused lower phosphate concentration in the water column and sediment interstitial water.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	112	2					131	136		10.1007/BF00006917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006917													WOS:A1984SU19900007

J	Kindaichi, S; Nishina, D; Wen, LW; Kannaka, T				Kindaichi, Sayaka; Nishina, Daisaku; Wen, Liwei; Kannaka, Taiki			Potential for using water reservoirs as heat sources in heat pump systems	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												There are many water reservoirs intended for agricultural applications or flood control in western Japan. These reservoirs may offer energy savings because their water is usually at a higher temperature in winter and lower temperature in summer than that of ambient air. The present work assesses whether thermal energy stored in these reservoirs can be used as heat sources for heat pump systems. Water temperatures were measured over 1 year at six different reservoir depths. During summer there was thermal stratification, in which water temperatures were widely distributed between 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C. During winter, active natural convection provided a stable vertical temperature distribution. A one-dimensional fluid dynamics model enabled reproduction of the measured water temperatures. Then, based on an index for cooling in summer (P-c) and another for heating in winter (P-h), the potential of using 16 reservoirs as heat sources was evaluated. These indices are related to differences between ambient air temperatures and water temperatures calculated near reservoir bottoms. Winter weather conditions were found to statistically affect both P-c and P-h. Weather conditions have little influence on water temperatures near reservoir bottoms in summer. Cold winters produce large values of P-c. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jager, HI				Jager, Henriette I.			Thinking outside the channel: Timing pulse flows to benefit salmon via indirect pathways	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Using models to represent relationships between flow and fishes has important practical applications for managing reservoir releases. Attempts to model such relationships often neglect indirect mechanisms by which flow influences fish. For example, growth of salmon juveniles is measurably faster when flows inundate floodplain and promote higher production of invertebrate prey, but out-of-channel flows have not yet been incorporated into models. The QUANTUS model developed here represents indirect linkages between flow and freshwater survival, mediated by temperature and prey availability, for fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Quantiles of spawning time and place were used to define cohorts of salmon in a regulated Central Valley, California river. Survival of these quantile-cohorts was simulated through incubation, juvenile growth, and eventual downstream migration. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the seasonal timing of pulse flows. Simulated survival was highest for flow regimes that provided a modest, temperature-moderating pulse flow in early summer and, for wetter years, a second, larger pulse of over-bank flow in late winter. For many rivers of the Pacific coast that support fall Chinook salmon, the thermal window of opportunity for spawning and rearing is narrow. Optimized flows made the most of this window by providing access to accelerated juvenile growth and early survival in floodplain habitat, a result that should be verified with field experiments. Timing of optimized pulse flows differed in some respects from the region's natural hydrograph, dominated by spring runoff. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms by which flow influences fishes can be important when shaping flows in the changed context of a regulated river. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Knowledge of the mean circulation in the Great Lakes is important for ecological and management issues because it provides an indication of transport pathways of nutrients and contaminants on longer time scales. Based on the availability of data, summer circulation patterns in all of the Great Lakes, winter circulation patterns in all of the Great Lakes except Lake Superior, and annual circulation patterns in Lakes EP-ie,: Michigan, and Ontario were derived. Winter currents are generally stronger than summer currents, and therefore, annual circulation closely resembles winter circulation. Circulation patterns tend to be cyclonic (counterclockwise) in the larger lakes (Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior) with increased cyclonic circulation in winter. In the smaller lakes (Lake Erie and Lake Ontario), winter circulation is characterized by a two-gyre circulation pattern. Summer circulation in the smaller lakes-is different; predominantly cyclonic in Lake Ontario and anticyclonic in Lake Erie.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; 													0380-1330						1999	25	1					78	93		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70718-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70718-5													WOS:000079811600007

In this work, we combine the analysis of this exceptional event with some synthetic scenarios, to achieve a deeper understanding of the main processes driving the thermal dynamics of surface water temperature in Lake Superior. The analysis is performed by means of the lumped model air2water, which simulates lake surface temperature as a function of air temperature alone. The model provides information about the seasonal stratification dynamics, suggesting that unusual warming events can result from two factors: anomalously high summer air temperatures, and increased strength of stratification resulting from a warm spring. The relative contribution of the two factors is quantified using the model by means of synthetic scenarios, which provide a simple but effective description of the positive feedback between the thermal behavior and the stratification dynamics of the lake.

Flight directions of songbirds are unaffected by the topography of Lake Erie's southern coastline during fall migration	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Migrating birds often encounter ecological barriers to fueling and other costs that can influence their flight directions. During spring migration, many migrants deviate westward along the southern coast of Lake Erie's western basin instead of continuing to fly the more northerly, broad-front direction and crossing the lake. The goal of this study was to determine if migrants arriving at the same locations along the southern coast of Lake Erie in autumn, after having now already flown over the lake, would similarly respond to the coastal features despite the different decision making, adaptive profile. During the fall migrations of 2015-2017, flight directions of individual migrants, overwhelmingly passerines, were recorded by an infrared camera from three coastal sites along the southern coast of Lake Erie's western basin. The regional broad-front direction of migration was taken from the WSR Doppler weather radar located near Cleveland, Ohio. Across multiple analyses, no differences in flight directions were observed either across the three observation sites or with respect to the broad-front direction. Generally, migrants flew in a south-southwesterly direction irrespective of location. Further, we found no differences in the flight directions of migrants early in the night compared to later in the night, suggesting that the energetic state did not substantially impact flight directions. In contrast to spring migration, the ecological boundary on Lake Erie's southern coast was not associated with any change in the flight directions of songbirds during fall migration, suggesting that migratory context is a critical factor determining how migrants may respond to environmental, topographic features.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				SEP	2021	92	3					260	272		10.1111/jofo.12374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofo.12374		AUG 2021											WOS:000685414700001

The importance of both autochthonous and allochthonous sources of organic matter differ, not only between alpine and subalpine locations, but also seasonally. Overall, autochthonous sources dominate the organic carbon of the alpine lake, while allochthonous sources are a more significant source of organic carbon to the subalpine lake. In the alpine lake, Sky Pond, POC makes up greater than one third of the total organic matter content of the water column, and is related to phytoplankton abundance. Dissolved organic carbon is a product of within-lake activity in Sky Pond except during spring snowmelt and early summer (May-July), when stable carbon isotope ratios suggest a terrestrial source. In the subalpine lake, The Loch, DOC is a much more important constituent of water column organic material than POC, comprising greater than 90% of the spring snowmelt organic matter. and greater than 75% of the organic matter over the rest of the year. Stable carbon isotope ratios and a very strong relation of DOC with soluble Al(tot) indicate DOC concentrations are almost entirely related to flushing of soil water from the surrounding watershed during spring snowmelt. Stable carbon isotope ratios indicate that, for both lakes, phytoplankton is an important source of DOC in the winter, while terrestrial material of plant or microbial origin contributes DOC during snowmelt and summer.

To narrow this gap, a desk study was performed between May 1998 and October 2004. Information on known wintering grounds was sought by means of questionnaires, personal communications, ringing data, publication and internet searches. Results show that the Aquatic Warbler has so far been recorded in nine African countries, but with recent records since 1980 from only five countries (Egypt, Ghana, Mauritania, Morocco and Senegal). All present data suggest that the Aquatic Warbler migrates through north-west Africa in autumn and spring, with the wintering grounds limited to wetlands of western sub-Saharan Africa, with verified records only from Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and Ghana during the months of August to April. The species was almost always found in habitats similar to that of its breeding grounds, i.e. in Carex, Juncus or Phraginites (sedge, rush and reed), associations, but also in dense grasses, shrubs and other vegetation found in freshwater marshes, flooded or wet meadows, and along the edges of backwaters, flood basins, lagoons, lakes, ponds, rivers and wadis. Recent research suggests that at least some Aquatic Warblers may actually winter further south than the present data suggest, in countries such as The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo and Benin, or maybe even in so far unexplored wetlands in Central or East Africa. Because wetlands throughout Africa face imminent threats from agricultural and tourist development, more fieldwork is urgently needed to further pinpoint the migration and wintering grounds of the Aquatic Warbler.

Water parameters interact with eutrophication and algal blooms. However, there are few studies on the spatial-temporal characteristics of water parameters in the Chaohu Lake Basin. To assess the water quality of Chaohu Lake and its seven surrounding rivers, 132 samples from 33 sites were collected seasonally from September 2019 to July 2020, and 14 physicochemical parameters were detected. Our results showed that urban rivers had the highest nutrients, chemical oxygen demand (CODMn, 6.30 +/- 0.80 mg/L), five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5, 4.51 +/- 0.42 mg/L), and chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a, 54.88 +/- 39.81 mu g/L); forested rivers had higher water transparency (137.83 +/- 18.52 cm), lowest nutrients, CODMn (4.02 +/- 0.20 mg/L), BOD5 (1.42 +/- 0.14 mg/L), and Chl a (7.18 +/- 1.41 mu g/L); and agricultural and mixed rivers intermediate. Generally, the water quality was "good" and "light-eutrophic" according to the water quality index and trophic level index. The water quality order from good to worst in the season was spring > autumn and summer > winter. These results implied that urban rivers are still the main source of eutrophic nutrients in Chaohu Lake, and the control of urban pollutants is still the core of water quality management in Chaohu Lake.

Effect of hydrological changes on algal blooming in the reservoir and the required modification for treatments	BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH												The severe incidences of Microcystis blooming in 1980s of the Sagami and Tsukui reservoirs, located in Sagami river, Japan were effectively controlled by the installation of 8 and 5 bubbling circulation systems, respectively. However, the blooming had started again in those reservoirs. It was found that those algal blooming occurred due to the formation of strong stratification following a temperature gradient between upper and lower water levels of those reservoirs. In recent years, algal blooming re-appeared due to the rise in temperature of the spring inflow. Another reservoir namely the Sensui lake, located at the tributary of Takahashi river in the western part of Japan experienced severe droughts in winter between 2002 and 2003 and between 2008 and 2009. After the drought, Microcystis declined while Anabaena increased at the deeper zone. It appeared that the improved light condition at the deeper sediment surface might provoke the germination of Anabaena. These results indicate that snow fall reduction due to the global warming increased the inflow temperature in the reservoir. Thus, there is a possibility that the present destratification systems are not effective enough to suppress the blooming. On the other hand, the exposure of the bottom sediment can prevent algal blooming by changing the species composition. The artificial drawdown of the water level and the exposure of the bottom sediment for twenty days in early spring in Watarase reservoir, Japan, delayed the Phormidium cell density peaks to late summer and the 2-MIB production rate also declined.

J	Kagami, M; Hirose, Y; Ogura, H				Kagami, Maiko; Hirose, Yutaka; Ogura, Hisako			Phosphorus and nitrogen limitation of phytoplankton growth in eutrophic Lake Inba, Japan	LIMNOLOGY												Lake Inba is one of the most eutrophic lakes in Japan. In this study, field sampling and nutrient enrichment bioassays were conducted to determine the seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth in this lake. Phytoplankton biomass increased significantly with the additions of phosphorus (P) on almost all sampling dates, indicating P limitation of phytoplankton growth from spring to autumn. However, nitrogen (N) limitation was also observed during summer (i.e., 19 August). On 10 August, a typhoon struck Lake Inba. After this event, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus concentrations increased, probably because of increased river discharge. At the same time, phytoplankton growth in the control treatment became relatively high, with the addition of neither P nor N stimulating the growth. However, 10 days after the typhoon, the phytoplankton growth rate in the control treatment decreased, with only the addition of N having a significant positive effect on phytoplankton growth. N limitation during summer is caused by the low concentrations of DIN, as well as changes in the N:P ratio due to allochthonous nutrient loads. These results indicate that a reduction of both P and N input is necessary to control phytoplankton blooms in Lake Inba.

In the Austrian Seewinkel region, salt pans are in an increasingly vulnerable state due to groundwater drainage and heightened climatic pressures. It is crucial to model how seasonal and long-term hydrological and climatological variations affect the salt pan dynamics in Seewinkel, yet a comprehensive understanding of the driving processes is lacking. The goal of this study is to develop random forest machine learning models driven by hydrological and meteorological data that allow us to predict in early spring (March) of each year the inundation state in the subsequent summer and fall. We utilize Earth observation data from Landsat 5 (L5), 8 (L8), and 9 (L9) to derive the time series of the inundation state for 34 salt pans for the period 1984-2022. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the groundwater level observed in March is the strongest predictor of the salt pan inundation state in summer and fall. Utilizing local groundwater data yields a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.59. Models using globally available meteorological data, either instead of or in addition to groundwater data, provide comparable results. This allows the global transfer of the approach to comparable ecosystems where no in situ data are available.					; Dorigo, Wouter/C-7794-2014	Schlaffer, Stefan/0000-0003-4742-8648; Dorigo, Wouter/0000-0001-8054-7572														2072-4292				OCT	2023	15	19							4659	10.3390/rs15194659	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15194659													WOS:001095652900001

This study aims to detect the interannual and seasonal changes and spatial patterns of water quality in this region. Based on cluster analysis, Moran's I, and standard deviational ellipses, the site clusters, spatial heterogeneity of water quality characteristics and identified polluted regions were clarified. Results showed that (1) water quality improved since 2002, and nutrient concentrations were lower in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. (2) The monitoring sites were divided into six clusters according to the water quality during the period from 2010 to 2014. Water quality worsened from Cluster 1 to Cluster 4. Cluster 1 sites were mostly distributed beside the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake. Cluster 4 sites were mainly located along the southeast border near Shanghai, while the remaining sites were separately distributed in the main cities. (3) A polluted region of both total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) was present in the southeastern part of the study area near the border from 2010 to 2014. In addition, polluted regions were most likely to form near the junctions of main cities. (4) Anthropogenic factors had greater impacts on water quality than natural factors. More attention should be given to water quality protection around impervious surface areas due to the greatest considerable effect.

The sampling was designed to simulate POP bioaccumulation in benthic and aquatic dwelling organisms as well as ambient air for estimation of ecological risk. The objective was to survey the spatiotemporal distribution and fate of bioavailable priority persistent organic compounds in the Hartbeespoort Dam in summer, autumn and winter seasons and to validate the utility of a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF) method for PCDD/F, PCB, and PBB analysis. The highest detection rates for bioavailable priority POPs were for PCB 77 and PCB 126 which were detected in 15 and 16 of the 22 samples, though the majority of the detections were < LOQ for PCB 77. Overall, PCB 126, PBB 10 and PBB 49 recorded the highest quantified bioavailable concentrations per site in SPMDs deployed in the Hartbeespoort Dam. The SPMDs deployed in air at the Magalies River site in winter recorded the highest toxic equivalency quotient (TEQ) of 29.77 pg TEQ SPMD-1. The highest TEQs recorded for SPMDs deployed in the sediment phase were 10.2, 3.3, and 3.2 pg TEQ SPMD-1, recorded at the Harbour site in summer, Dam wall in summer and Harbour in winter respectively. In water, SPMDs deployed at the Crocodile River site recorded the highest TEQ of 0.81 pg TEQ SPMD-1 in summer. TEQ data shows that air carries significant bioavailable dl-toxicity compared to the water phase, and sediment generally carries the highest dl-toxicity. Detection rates for bioavailable PBBs were generally very low, with < 3 detections being quantified above the LOQ for the majority of the sites. Statistical analysis of TEQs computed at all sites, using AVOVA shows that the dispersion of TEQs in the Hartbeespoort Dam is largely homogenous as the differences between the TEQs were insignificant (p > 0.05).					; chimuka, luke/LOR-9818-2024	Chimuka, Luke/0000-0002-8552-2478; Rimayi, Chengetayi Cornelius/0000-0002-5494-7094													0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2022	194	2							117	10.1007/s10661-022-09784-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09784-1								35072821					WOS:000746610800007

Mussel squeeze: dissolved oxygen and temperature can "squeeze" zebra mussels out of invaded reservoirs	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species that cause extensive economic and ecological impacts and are a management priority in areas outside of their native range. Survivorship and distribution of zebra mussels within a waterbody are thought to be influenced by temperature and dissolved oxygen conditions, but detailed information to confirm the importance of these environmental controls is necessary to inform management efforts. We measured planktonic zebra mussel veliger density and adult survivorship in San Justo Reservoir in central California to determine distribution and timing of spawning in relation to temperature and dissolved oxygen throughout winter, spring, and summer. We found seasonal patterns in adult survivorship, with high mortality late in the summer and higher than expected survivorship during the spring when dissolved oxygen concentrations were approximately 1 mg/L. Veliger abundance peaked several meters above the thermocline from June to August. Dissolved oxygen concentrations limited veliger distribution, with few to no veligers collected in the anoxic hypolimnion. Veliger settlement out of the water column appears to be possible in San Justo Reservoir at any time of year. A better understanding of how veligers, juveniles, and adult mussels respond to fluctuating dissolved oxygen and temperature conditions will further knowledge of timing and duration of water drawdowns or other control methods for managing this harmful invasive species.

The pattern of algal seasonal succession changed from a summer maximum comprised of a mixture of diatoms, greens and blue-greens to a spring maximum comprised of diatoms followed by diminished summer levels with dominance by greens and blue-greens. Summer algal standing crop and the shift to a spring pulse are related phenomena resulting from the pattern of P loading to the lake. The combination of data on algal biomass, chlorophyll and Secchi disc transparency describes the long-term trend in the lake''s trophic state and demonstrates a large increase in algal standing crop in the period roughly coincidental with the advent of P-based detergents. The increase in algal standing crop from pre-1940 levels to present levels closely corresponds with that predicted by the Oglesby-Schaffner regression model from the increase in P loading due to P-based detergents.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1982	12	2					149	166		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00610.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00610.x													WOS:A1982NG74200004

Throughout interval 1 (ca. 7800 to 6700 yr B.P.), climate was colder and much drier than today. During intervals 2 and 3 (ca. 6700 to 4000 yr B.P.) average mean-annual air temperatures approached the modern mean (3.7.degree.

Furthermore, average mean-annual precipitation was about 85 and 90% of modern during intervals 2 and 3, respectively. Transition times between the principal intervals were less than 50 yr. The expected effects of a retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet that initially maintained a winter-style circulation, followed by transitional climate states, and finally a near-modern circulation pattern may explain these local climatic events.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				SEP	1987	28	2					263	273		10.1016/0033-5894(87)90064-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(87)90064-0													WOS:A1987K418100007
J	Krsinic, F				Krsinic, Frano			Taxonomical and ecological characteristics of Centropages ponticus (Copepoda, Calanoida) from the saline Lake Mir (Dugi Otok, Adriatic Sea)	ACTA ADRIATICA												Calanoid copepod Centropages ponticus, endemic to the Mediterranean and Black Sea, is the only pelagic copepod species which was found in the closed ecosystem of the saline Lake Mir on Dugi Otok, eastern Adriatic Sea. This paper presents some important morphological characteristics and the annual population structure investigated from November 1999 to October 2000 at one station in the deepest part of Lake Mir. Investigation topics included the temporal distribution and abundances of nauplii, copepodites and adult specimens, as well as the density of their faecal pellets. It would appear that only C. ponticus is adapted to the extreme conditions of the lake, low winter and high summer temperatures, as well as long period of hypersaline conditions. During the summer-autumn period, the abundances of nauplii, copepodites and adult specimens reach extreme values. Lake Mir is ecologically very interesting and generally among very rare habitats. Our results suggest the necessity for further complex research of this natural laboratory for the purpose of its full protection.

J	Skabeikis, A; Lesutiene, J				Skabeikis, Arturas; Lesutiene, Jurate			Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) in the coastal waters of SE Baltic Sea	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby were investigated in the south-eastern Baltic Sea, the Lithuanian coastal waters during May-October 2012 in order to determine main feeding objects and seasonal periods when native fauna could be most affected by predation of this highly invasive species. In total, prey represented by 18 taxa was found in the gut contents of dissected fish. Feeding activity of round goby varied depending on the body size, sex and stage of the reproduction period. The gut contents of <50 mm specimens were dominated by zooplanktonic and meiobenthic organisms, whereas larger individuals (5099 mm) shifted to amphipods and mollusks. Individuals of the intermediate 100-200 mm length had a variable diet, changing depending on the season; in spring they mostly preyed on Macoma balthica, in summer - on polychaetes, while in autumn the contribution of Mytilus trossulus and fish considerably increased in their diet. Diet composition of individuals >= 200 mm was relatively constant in the course of the study with substantial preference to M. balthica. These findings imply that benthic fauna, particularly a newly settled generation of epibenthic mollusks in autumn is under strong predatory pressure of the round goby.

When the lake is stratified, the calculated delta O-18 of carbonate that would precipitate from the water column is less than that measured in the sediment because of freshwater dilution in the mixolimnion and high temperatures (up to 46-degrees-C) in the monimolimnion. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the lake is supersaturated with respect to carbonate phases throughout the year. However, the delta O-18 data indicate that carbonate is precipitated during the late summer and autumn when the lake is unstratified, biologic activity is high, and the water temperature is moderate. The delta C-13 values of the calcium carbonate minerals precipitated in the lake are heavier than the dissolved inorganic carbon values (delta C-13-DIC) of the lake water and cannot be explained by kinetic fractionation, indicating a biologic control on primary carbonate precipitation. The delta C-13 of dolomite found in the lake sediments are in equilibrium with porewater delta C-13-DIC, suggesting a high degree of porewater interaction in dolomitization. Both the delta O-18 and delta C-13 compositions of the dolomite suggest that it formed in equilibrium with current porewater but not in equilibrium with the coexisting calcium carbonate minerals.

UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF YELLOWSTONE LAKE IN THE PREHISTORY OF INTERIOR NORTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA	NORTH AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGIST												As North America's largest, high-elevation lake, Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, played an important role in the lifeways of Great Plains, Great Basin, and Rocky Mountains Native Americans during prehistory. Various hypotheses suggest that the lake was important during the spring for fishing, during the winter for hunting, and/or during warm months for generalized foraging. Because the lake's islands contain archaeological sites, some also have proposed that boats were utilized during prehistory at the lake. Using ethnohistoric, archaeological, and spatial data, we evaluate these suppositions about use of Yellowstone Lake. We suggest that annual use of the lake was initiated in early spring when the lake was frozen providing access to islands and continued through the summer. Lithic data and ethnohistoric research support the hypothesis that multiple ethnic groups used the lake in prehistory because it is a concentrated resource area.

Monthly diatom samples were collected from the surface water at western, central, and eastern pelagic areas of the ellipsoid-shaped lake using a plankton net from November 2004 to October 2005. When high temperature and pH levels prevailed in May and September, Epithemia, Rhopalodia, Cocconeis, and Cyclotella were dominant. Cymbella was dominant in early spring and late autumn, but was not significantly correlated with temperature or pH. The species of Gomphonema, Fragilaria, Navicula, and Nitzschia were dominant at low temperature and pH levels in winter. However, the diatom community of the surface phytoplankton in the lake comprised largely cosmopolitan and nonplanktonic species of Cocconeis, Cyclotella, Cymbella, Epithemia, Fragilaria, Gomphonema, and Rhopalodia detached from benthic habitats of littoral zone by wind-driven currents.

Our results showed that TP contents in spring and AP contents in both seasons in surface soils increased with increasing distances away from the Yellow River channel. TP contents in surface soils (0-10 cm) followed the order Site A (698.6 mg/kg) > Site B (688.0 mg/kg) > Site C (638.8 mg/kg) > Site D (599.2 mg/kg) in fall, while Site C (699.6 mg/kg) > Site D (651.7 mg/kg) > Site B (593.6 mg/kg) > Site A (577.5 mg/kg) in spring. Generally, lower TP content (630.6 mg/kg) and higher AP level (6.2 mg/kg) in surface soils were observed in spring compared to fall (656.2 mg/kg for TP and 5.2 mg/kg for AP). Both TP and AP exhibited similar profile distribution patterns and decreased with depth along soil profiles with one or two accumulation peaks at the depth of 40-80 cm. Although the mean TP content in soil profiles was slightly higher in spring (635.7 mg/kg) than that in fall (628.0 mg/kg), the mean TP stock was obviously lower in spring (959.9 g/m(2)) with an obvious accumulation at the 60-80 cm soil depth compared to fall (1124.6 g/m(2)). Topsoil concentration factors also indicated that TP and AP had shallower distribution in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that AP had significant and positive correlation with these soil properties such as soil organic matter, salinity, total nitrogen and Al (p < 0.01), but TP was just significantly correlated with TN and Al (p < 0.05).					; wang, jungjing/G-3317-2015; Bai, Junhong/V-1993-2019	Bai, Junhong/0000-0003-2613-2143; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2014	71	11					4811	4820		10.1007/s12665-013-2872-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2872-3													WOS:000335754100017
J	Oberhänsli, H; Weise, SM; Stanichny, S				Oberhaensli, Hedi; Weise, Stephan M.; Stanichny, Sergej			Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic water characteristics of the Aral Sea, Central Asia	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The Aral Sea, located in a semi-arid environment, undergoes substantial annual (1200 mm/yr) and decadal lake-level fluctuations due to extreme seasonality in evaporation and precipitation along with steadily reduced river discharge. To trace the source ofthe lake water and understand the internal dynamics of the lake, we used oxygen and deuterium isotope composition of the lake water collected at different depths during spring and autumn from 2004 to 2006. We collected data from both the western (W) and eastern (E) basins ofthe Large Aral Sea as well as the channel connecting the two basins. The oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios ofthe lake water vary widely (+4.6 to -5.3%. and -48 to +11%., respectively). We further measured isotopic ratios of groundwater leakage near the shoreline of the W basin of the Large Aral Sea and released in an artesian well on the Kulandy Peninsula. These ratios range from -16 to +3.4%. (delta O-180) and - 120 to +2.2% (delta D). The river water displays ratios of -12% (delta O-18) and -81.3% (delta D). Precipitation from winter and early spring 2006 exhibit delta O-18 values of -14% (snow) and +0.2% (rain) and delta D values of -97% (snow) and +3.6% (rain). The oxygen and hydrogen isotope snapshots show that in addition to evaporation, groundwater effluent flows at different depths are major contributors to the lake in spring and autumn. The d-excess, ranging between -25% (lake water) and +10% (groundwater), further demonstrates the impact of both effluent groundwater and evaporation on the isotopic composition of the lake water. Thus, stable isotope ratios can provide a first insight into seasonally triggered hydrologic interactions in the western part of the endorheic Aral Sea region. Remote sensing studies prove that major groundwater leakage occurs along the entire shoreline, except for the western shore where spatial resolution was too low. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Salmaso, N				Salmaso, Nico			Long-term phytoplankton community changes in a deep subalpine lake: responses to nutrient availability and climatic fluctuations	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In natural lakes, modifications in the species composition and abundance of phytoplankton communities may ultimately be responses to changes in nutrient availability and climatic fluctuations. Phytoplankton and associated environmental factors were collected at monthly intervals from the beginning of the 1990s to 2007 in the large subalpine Lake Garda (Z(max) = 350 m, V = 49 x 10(9) m(3)). In this study period, the lake showed a slight and continuous increase of total phosphorus (TP) in the water column, up to concentrations of 18-20 mu g P L-1. This increase represented the last stage of a long-term process of enrichment documented since the 1970s, when concentrations of TP were below or around 10 mu g P L-1. 2. At the community level, annual phytoplankton cycles underwent a unidirectional and slow shift mainly due to changes in the species more affected by the nutrient enrichment of the lake. After a first and long period of dominance by conjugatophytes (Mougeotia) and diatoms (Fragilaria), phytoplankton biomass in recent years was sustained by cyanobacteria (Planktothrix). Other important modifications in the development of phytoplankton were superimposed on this pattern due to the effects of annual climate fluctuations principally mediated by the deep mixing events at spring overturn and, secondarily, by temperature and thermal stability of the water column during the growing season. 3. Interannual variations in the stability and temperature of the water column appeared to influence the development of a few subdominant flagellates (dinophytes and cryptophytes). Nevertheless, the major impact of climate on phytoplankton was indirect, and mediated through the effects of winter climatic conditions on deep mixing dynamics. Winter climatic fluctuations proved to be a key element in a linked chain of causal factors including cooling of hypolimnetic waters, deep vertical mixing and epilimnetic nutrient replenishment. The process of fertilisation was measurable both for TP and dissolved inorganic nitrogen, although only the first had a large effect, reinforcing the seasonal growth of a few dominant groups. The degree of nutrient replenishment further increased the spring development of large diatoms and the increase of Planktothrix in summer and autumn. 4. Currently, changes in nutrient concentrations have the greatest effect on the phytoplankton community, while direct effects due to the interannual variations in the thermal regime are of secondary importance compared with the indirect effects mediated through deep water mixing and spring fertilisation. Overall, the results demonstrate that the consequences of climatic fluctuations and climate warming on phytoplankton communities need to be studied at different levels of complexity and integration, from the direct effects of temperature and thermal regime, to the indirect effects mediated by the physiographic characteristics of water bodies.

J	Girdner, S; Sprague, J				Girdner, Scott; Sprague, Joshua			Seasonal patterns of phytoplankton photoacclimation in a dimictic oligotrophic lake over 5 yr: Implications for chlorophyll as an estimate of biomass	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Chlorophyll a is commonly used as a surrogate for algal biomass in lakes and oceans even though phytoplankton can readily adjust intracellular chlorophyll concentration to changes in the environment through a cellular process termed photoacclimation. Marine studies have documented fluctuations in cellular chlorophyll to year-round changes in light intensity and nutrients using the chlorophyll : carbon ratio to estimate cellular pigment density. However, similar freshwater studies are almost exclusively limited to chlorophyll : carbon ratios at the summertime deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) depth in less productive water. This study expands direct estimates of freshwater photoacclimation to all seasons of the year utilizing optically derived estimates of algal carbon and chlorophyll fluorescence from high-frequency (daily) data. We describe patterns of photoacclimation at daily, seasonal, and interannual time scales over a 5-yr period. We show that increases in chlorophyll density at the cellular level not only occurred at the DCM depth during summer stratification but were a dominant and recurring feature when the lake was vertically mixing in fall, winter, and spring. Pigment density within the mixed layer was negatively correlated with light level, indicating a photoacclimation driven response to reduced light intensity. Predicting how cellular pigment density is affected by the surrounding environment in a replicated range of lake systems is needed if chlorophyll is to be accurately used as an estimate of algal biomass in freshwaters.

The aim of the present work was to study the role and diversity of winter APP communities in temperate shallow lakes by means of analysis of measures of size-fractionated photosynthesis and culture-based molecular taxonomic identification. Our results show that APP comprised a substantial part of planktonic primary production in shallow Central European great lakes (13-46% in Lake Balaton and 11-42% in Lake Ferto). Better acclimation of APP than that of the larger phytoplankton (>3 mu m) to low-temperature and low-light winter environment was confirmed by their higher maximum photosynthetic rate and light utilization parameter. Maximum photosynthetic rate and light saturation parameter increased significantly with both temperature and available light, but with different impact on the two size groups. Twenty-two picoeukaryotic strains were isolated and identified based on 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Taxonomic composition of the picoeukaryotic community in the studied shallow lakes was similar to other freshwater lakes in the temperate zone: members of genera Choricystis and Mychonastes were dominant, however, in Lake Balaton, common freshwater taxa such as Stichococcus bacillaris and Nannochloris bacillaris were also found.

The coloured water supported only low concentrations of chlorophyll a (<1.6 mu g l(-1)), with the highest values occurring in summer. Mean bacterial abundance ranged between 2.3 x 10(8) and 7.1 x 10(8) l(-1) in the 100 m water column. Maximum abundance did not correlate with maximum chlorophyll a concentrations. but appeared to be related to the input of allochthonous carbon from the catchment, which in turn was influenced by rainfall levels. Consequently, the highest bacterioplankton concentrations occurred in autumn and winter. The pattern of heterotrophic nanoflagellate abundance tended to follow that for bacteria, with mean concentrations in the top 100 m of the water column of between 12 x 10(3) and 273 x 10(3) l(-1). Ciliate abundance showed no seasonal trends over the study period and probably mirrored the fluctuating availability of various food resources. Oligotrichs, particularly mixotrophic taxa, were a prominent element of the community throughout the year. Aggregates of detrital material were a regular feature in the plankton. When these occurred, they formed foci for bacteria and nanoflagellates. The evidence suggests that the dynamics of the microbial plankton in Loch Ness may be driven by allochthonous carbon inputs rather than by the more usual dominance of carbon fixed within the system.

In this study, we evaluated effectiveness of dredging performed for six years on controlling cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni) contamination of sediments. High-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) methods were applied to analyze the non-dredged and post-dredging sediments. The soluble and DGT-labile Co and Ni content declined by 22% and 44% (soluble) and by 16% and 26% (labile) in April, July and October in the post-dredging region. In contrast, their concentrations increased by 105% and 9% (soluble) and 322% and 27% (labile) in January. These changes in the dredging effects were caused by the corresponding changes in the reducible and residual fractions of Co and the residual fraction of Ni in sediments in the dredged site, respectively. Soluble and DGT-labile Zn decreased on average by 23% and 29% in July and October and increased on average by 151% and 52% in April and January in the post dredging region. The different Zn mobility in the post-dredging region was controlled by the reducible fraction of Zn. The results revealed positive influence of dredging engineering in summer, autumn and/or spring and negative one in winter. Therefore, an accurate assessment of dredging effectiveness should take its seasonal variation into consideration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hasegawa, T; Okino, T				Hasegawa, T; Okino, T			Seasonal variation of denitrification rate in Lake Suwa sediment	LIMNOLOGY												The seasonal variation of denitrification rate in sediments in the central station of Lake Suwa, Japan, was estimated by the acetylene-inhibition technique from March 20 to December 10, 1994. The denitrification rate ranged from 0 to 1800 mumol N m(-2) day(-1) and showed a distinct seasonal trend, i.e., relatively high rates in spring and winter, and low or negligible rates in summer. The denitrification rate was well correlated with NO3- concentration in overlying water, suggesting that NO3- in overlying water was the primary controlling factor for denitrification. The annual rate of denitrification was 0.15 mol N m(-2) year(-1). Denitrification removed 5% of the annual nitrogen load from the lake, and this fraction was relatively small compared to the values reported for a variety of aquatic environments. In Lake Suwa, NO3- in the water column was depleted during summer, and this suppressed effective removal of nitrogen from the lake by denitrification.																			1439-8621					APR	2004	5	1					33	39		10.1007/s10201-003-0109-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0109-y													WOS:000220834700005

Bioaccumulation of metals in fish of different diets from hydro-accumulations on the Neretva River, Bosnia and Herzegovina	GLASNIK HEMICARA I TEHNOLOGA BOSNE I HERCEGOVINE												There is a growing need to assess the level of contaminants in fish as bioindicators of the health and well-being of fish and humans as its consumers. Contamination by heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) was evaluated using atomic absorption spectrometer, flame and graphite furnace technique in the water samples and fish muscle tissues of Sander lucioperca, Leuciscus svallize and Tinca tinca of four hydro-accumulation lakes on the Neretva River, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Samples were collected during two seasons: autumn-winter and spring-summer (2019). It has been shown that iron (Fe) was the highest accumulating metal in fish, whilst cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) were the lowest. Heavy metals contents were below the maximum permissible for drinking water and for fish as prescribed by national legislation. According to correlation matrix between metals content in all fish during both fishing seasons, the highest values of the Pearson coefficient were obtained in the case of essential elements (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) and Fe and Mn also had a statistically significant correlation with Cd and Pb. Furthermore, potential health risk assessment exposure of the adult population in B&H revealed that none of the seven heavy metals pose risk to human health, based on the estimated daily intake via consumption of these fish species as well as target hazard quotient and hazard index values less than 1.

Three factors were separated based on PMF for the statistical investigation of the datasets both in summer and winter. These factors were dominated by the pattern of single sources or groups of similar sources, showing seasonal and regional variations. The main sources of PAHs in Dalian soil in summer were the emissions from coal combustion average (46%), diesel engine (30%), and gasoline engine (24%). In winter, the main sources were the emissions from coal-fired boiler (72%), traffic average (20%), and gasoline engine (8%). These factors with strong seasonality indicated that coal combustion in winter and traffic exhaust in summer dominated the sources of PAHs in soil. These results suggested that PMF model was a proper approach to identify the sources of PAHs in soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An exposure-dependent decrease in condition factor was observed in both seasons. Liver glycogen and triglyceride reserves were higher in summer than in fall in fish from the reference lake, while the seasonal pattern was different in fish from the contaminated lakes. Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) levels were also influenced by season and contamination. Activities of malic enzyme (ME) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the liver were higher in the summer than in the fall in reference lakes whereas no seasonal variations were detected in fish from contaminated lakes. Activities of pyruvate kinase (PyK), aspartate transaminase (AST), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), were higher in fish from contaminated lakes in fall but not in summer. Chronic exposure of yellow perch to sublethal levels of heavy metals impairs growth and alters the seasonal cycling of liver glycogen and triglycerides as well as the activities of metabolic enzymes.

Climate monitoring indicates that the region is characterised by a high continentality index, and seasonal distribution of precipitation amount. The 6180 and delta D values in precipitation varied from -4.0 parts per thousand to -15.9 parts per thousand and -22.8 parts per thousand to -118.8 parts per thousand, respectively The LMWL for the monthly based data is delta D = 7.40*delta O-18 + 4.4 showing the effect of secondary evaporation of falling raindrops with lower intercept and slope. The significant relationship between delta O-18 and delta D values and average air temperature is delta O-18 = 0.36T - 13.36 (r(2) = 0.69, n = 40) and delta D = 2.57T 92.80 (r(2) = 0.58, n = 40), respectively. The distribution of deuterium excess over the year indicates seasonal variation for the origin of moisture, with high values during wintertime. We interpret this as the result of the input of seasonal related Mediterranean moisture during the late autumn and winter. 3-D modelling of spring distribution shows the presence of mainly two aquifer levels, slightly deepening toward south and southeast. The isotopic distribution of groundwaters reflects weighted mean of the delta O-18 and delta D of precipitation, -9.8 and 67.8 respectively, demonstrating locally derived groundwaters.

Altogether, 125 genera, 21 functional groups, and 7 predominant functional groups, D (Fragilaria acus, Synedra acus, and Nitzschia spp.), P (Fragilaria capucina and Aulacoseira granulate), MP (Oscillatoria spp., Diploneis ovalis, Gomphonema angustatum, Nitzschia palea, and Achnanthes spp.), Y (Cryptomonas ovata, Cryptomonas erosa, Chroomonas acuta, and Ceratium spp.), H2 (Anabaena spp.), M (Microcystis spp.), and W1 (Euglenoids spp.), were identified, and these predominant functional groups exhibited strong seasonal variations. Groups Y and W1 dominated from winter to spring when temperature and light were low. The external pollution load and high levels of nutrients entered the lake in June, allowing group M to become dominant, even ultimately triggering Microcystis blooming. Meanwhile, the abundance of aquatic plants in summer, combined with high levels of transparency and light availability, resulted in Group M being replaced by Group P and then Groups M and H2 rebounding in autumn. The redundancy analysis revealed that water temperature, nutrients, and light availability (Z(eu)/Z(mix)) were the key factors promoting phytoplankton succession. The ecological assessment results demonstrated a good ecological status based on the assemblage index (Q average = 3.0). This work emphasizes the fact that temperature, nutrients, and light were the driving factors for phytoplankton dynamics, and aquatic plants and external pollution were important external factors for the succession of phytoplankton.					; Li, Jianhua/KEI-6539-2024	Jing, Nan/0000-0002-2904-562X; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2020	35	1					409	427		10.1080/02705060.2020.1842261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2020.1842261													WOS:000584636900001

The influence of pH, Eh and microbial activity on SRP nux at the SWI was investigated by manipulating the conditions in the overlying water of intact sediment cores. The calculated diffusive SRP flux out of the sediment was lower in cores sampled during winter and spring than during the period of amixis. Potential SRP release, as measured in the absence of microbial activity, was strongly enhanced upon the transition from oxic to anoxic conditions indicating P release from iron(III)-bound phosphorus. In spring and summer cores, an enhanced SRP flux from sediments at pH 7 in comparison to pH 8 indicated P release from carbonate-bound P which sedimented previously as result of high pH values during the algal spring bloom. Microbial uptake at the SWI was the most important sink for SRP and no net-flux occured under oxic conditions. The higher net-flux of P under anoxic conditions was linked to carbon limitation of the bacteria at the SWI.

J	SCHREIBER, RW				SCHREIBER, RW			ROOSTING BEHAVIOR OF HERRING GULL IN CENTRAL MAINE	WILSON BULLETIN												An attempt was made to correlate this behavior with environmental factors during the summer and fall of 1965. The summer roost was on rocks in the swift flowing Penobscot River within the town limits of Orono. The fall roost was 5 miles distant on Pushaw Lake. During the summer the Penobscot River roost was used by up to 400 gulls but by 25 Sept. no birds roosted there. Beginning in Sept. the roost at Pushaw Lake was used and by the middle of Nov. as many as 4000 gulls were using this roost. When the ice formed on the lake no gulls spent the night there. These changes in the location of the roost are explained in relation to the numbers of gulls in the area and the human activity of the lake. A significant difference existed between the time of roosting during the summer and fall. During the summer the gulls roosted earlier relative to time of sunset than during the fall. These differences were probably caused by changes in the physiological needs of the gulls and by the changes in day length. During the fall the majority of the gulls arrived when the light intensities were under 300 ft. candles; a peak movement was reached between 115 and 10 ft. candles. During the summer the rate of arrival did not vary between clear and cloudy days, but during the fall significantly more birds arrive at the roost earlier on cloudy than on clear days. V/ind velocity and direction, and temperature did not have a direct effect on roosting time, but may have had an indirect effect. Social interaction and disturbances at the feeding and loafing areas of the gulls may have hastened roosting flights.																			0043-5643						1967	79	4					421	+																WOS:A1967A442500004

The study included 3 small, non-flow-through reservoirs, situated close to the village of Setal, in the commune of Dywity. Water samples for analysis were collected once a month in 2005 and 2006. They were examined in respect of the magnesium level and such physicochemical parameters as temperature, pH, oxygenation, dissolved oxygen, electrolyte conduction and water depth. The results prove that the environment of the surface waters in this area is poor in magnesium (5.2 mg.dm(-3) - 6.6 mg.dm(-3) on average), which is characteristic for postglacial regions. The re-created water reservoirs can be listed in water quality class I in terms of their magnesium content. The waters of these small re-created lakes were characterised by huge seasonal changes of magnesium concentrations. However, the fluctuations of Mg+2 concentrations were often larger within particular sites than between the examined reservoirs. The highest average seasonal magnesium concentration of 6.6 mg.dm(-3), varying from 3.9 mg.dm(-3) to 10.0 mg.dm(-3), was determined in the waters of a reservoir whose whole catchment had for many years been used for agriculture. The lowest magnesium concentrations in the waters of the reservoirs occurred in springtime, with a slight increase in early summer and an equally slight decline afterwards. No significant increase in magnesium amounts was found until autumn, before they reached their peaks in wintertime. Such a course of fluctuations was caused by the maximum magnesium biosorption in spring and releasing internal reserves (green matter and bottom deposits) of the reservoirs in autumn and winter. Decrease and increase in the Mg+2 ion concentration in the waters of the reservoirs occurred in two 'pulses': in the springtime and wintertime, respectively.

J	Mai, YP; Zhao, XY; Huang, GR				Mai, Yepeng; Zhao, Xiaoying; Huang, Guoru			Temporal and spatial variability of water quality in an urban wetland and the effects of season and rainfall: a case study in the Daguan Wetland, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Urban wetlands provide multiple functions including water treatment, recreation, and education, but they are also highly vulnerable, so it is important to monitor wetland water quality to ensure wetland health. In this study, water quality parameters of an urban wetland and rainfall were monitored at 6 sites for 1 year. The correlation analysis of water quality parameters and spatial-temporal variability analysis of water quality were carried out. Besides, the effects of season and rainfall on the wetland water quality were evaluated by the comprehensive water quality identification index (CWQII). These results have shown that there is a significant correlation between nutrient pollutants and Chl-a. Wetland water quality changed with the seasons, but it also varied due to changes in rainfall and location. The water quality of the shallow areas both had high susceptibility and response to seasonal changes and rainfall, but the water quality of the deepwater area was relatively stable. The CWQIIs in different seasons were ranked: Winter (5.98) > spring (4.67) > autumn (4.66) > summer (4.26), and the CWQIIs of different rainfall intensities were ranked: torrential rain (5.09) > heavy rain (4.88) > light rain (4.50) > no rain (4.39) > moderate rain (3.95). The results of this study distinctly explained the effects of season and rainfall on water quality in an urban wetland in a subtropical monsoon climate zone and would be helpful to the policymakers and concerned authorities in developing better water quality management strategies for these wetlands.

This study employs airborne hyperspectral remote sensing image data to explore remote sensing estimation methods for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in Lake Dianshan, Yuandang, as well as its main inflow and outflow rivers. Our findings reveal the following: (1) Spectral bands between 700 and 750 nm show the highest correlation with TN and TP concentrations during the summer and autumn seasons. Spectral reflectance bands exhibit greater sensitivity to TN and TP concentrations compared to the winter and spring seasons. (2) Seasonal models developed using the Catboost method demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than other machine learning (ML) models. On the test set, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.6 mg/L for TN and 0.05 mg/L for TP concentrations, with average absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 23.77% and 25.14%, respectively. (3) Spatial distribution maps of the retrieved TN and TP concentrations indicate their dependence on exogenous inputs and close association with algal blooms. Higher TN and TP concentrations are observed near the inlet (Jishui Port), with reductions near the outlet (Lanlu Port), particularly for the TP concentration. Areas with intense algal blooms near shorelines generally exhibit higher TN and TP concentrations. This study offers valuable insights for processing small water bodies using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing images and provides reliable remote sensing techniques for lake water quality monitoring and management.

Similarities and dissimilarities between the last two deglaciations and interglaciations in the North Atlantic region	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) recorded by alkenones and oxygen isotopes in the Alboran basin are used here to describe, at an unprecedented fine temporal resolution, the present interglaciation (PIG, initiated at 11.7 ka BP), the last interglaciation (LIG, onset approximately at 129 ka) and respective deglaciations. Similarities and dissimilarities in the progression of these periods are reviewed in comparison with ice cores and stalagmites. Cold spells coeval with the Heinrich events (H) described in the North Atlantic include multi-decadal scale oscillations not previously obvious (up to 4 degrees C in less than eight centuries within the stadials associated with H1 and H11, ca 133 ka and 17 ka respectively). These abrupt oscillations precede the accumulation of organic rich layers deposited when perihelion moves from alignment with NH spring equinox to the summer solstice, a reference for deglaciations. Events observed during the last deglaciation at 17 ka, 14.8 ka and 11.7 ka are reminiscent of events occurred during the penultimate deglaciation at ca 136 ka, 132 ka and 129 ka, respectively. The SST trend during the PIG is no more than 2 degrees C (from 20 degrees C to 18 degrees C; up to -0.2 degrees C/ka). The trend is steeper during the LIG, i.e. up to a 5 degrees C change from the early interglaciation to immediately before the glacial inception (from 23 degrees C to 18 degrees C; up to -0.4 degrees C/ka). Events are superimposed upon a long term trend towards colder SSTs, beginning with SST maxima followed by temperate periods until perihelion aligned with the NH autumn equinox (before ca 5.3 ka for the PIG and 121 ka for the LIG). A cold spell of around eight centuries at 2.8 ka during the PIG was possibly mimicked during the LIG at ca 118 ka by a SST fall of around 1 degrees C in a millennium. These events led interglacial SST to stabilise at around 18 degrees C. The glacial inception, barely evident at the beginning ca 115 ka (North Atlantic event C25, after perihelion passage in the NH winter solstice), culminated with a SST drop of at least 2 degrees C in two millennia (event C24, ca 111 ka). The Little Ice Age (0.7 ka) also occurred after the latest perihelion passage in the NH winter solstice and could be an example of how a glacial pre-inception event following an interglaciation might be.

J	Talling, JF; Spencer, HJ; Morison, HR				Talling, JF; Spencer, HJ; Morison, HR			The 'shock period': dynamics of phytoplankton during the spring-summer transition of a stratifying English lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The spring to summer transition in a productive English lake is considered with respect to phytoplankton and its environmental conditions. Salient environmental changes include the onset of temperature/density stratification that is usually accompanied by a clear-water phase associated with a maximum of grazing Daphnia and a minimum of phytoplankton in the 0-5 m zone. Below this zone, as thermal stratification progresses, a deep maximum of phytoplankton can develop under strong thermal/density gradients and enhanced light penetration. Examples are resolved by estimations of chlorophyll-a, beam attenuance in situ and cell counts. Attributed origins are by sedimentation of diatoms, migration of flagellates, and depth-adjusted buoyancy of a gas-vacuolate cyanophyte. The transition period involves a decline of spring-associated diatom populations and a rise of summer-associated species. The generally low algal abundance within the transition phase has at least four origins - prior nutrient (Si) depletion, sedimentation, grazing, and low 'inoculum' levels of successor species. It can be augmented by the re-growth of species abundant in spring, by early extensions of normally summer species, by seasonally characteristic colonial chrysophytes, and by other phytoflagellates of small size that are seasonally less specific ('opportunistic') and probably critical for Daphnia grazing with consequent generation of the clear-water phase.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 15	2005	533						15	28		10.1007/s10750-004-1462-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-1462-5													WOS:000226928900002

Simultaneous incorporation of H-3-thymidine into DNA and C-14-leucine into proteins was monitored as a tool for the measurement of bacterial secondary production in the aerobic zone of the sediment along with bacterial numbers, morphotype composition, cell volumes, biomass, frequency of dividing cells (FDC), and abiotic variables. Bacterial numbers ranged from 2.5 x 10(9) to 8.5 x 10(9) cells ml(-1), corresponding to bacterial biomass values of 64 and 288 mu g C ml(-1), respectively. Both bacterial production methods yielded similar and reliable results over the whole investigation period, varying between 42 and 2,350 mu g C L-1 h(-1) for the thymidine method and between 67 and 2,490 mu g C L-1 h(-1) for the leucine method, and also corresponded well with the FDC values. Only during late spring and early summer was the thymidine uptake uncoupled from leucine incorporation. Temperature was found to be of significant importance for the variation of all bacterial parameters. In addition carbon inputs from the water column were apparently crucial stimulators. of benthic bacterial growth. The spring phytoplankton bloom together with higher temperatures led to a strong positive response of the bacterial community in the sediment. However, the planktonic algal production was not sufficient to cover the benthic bacterial C-demand and, as derived from mass-balance calculations, decaying macrophytes of the previous season seemed to provide the main energy source until the middle of spring. From the middle of August to the beginning of October, the period of maximal biomass of submerged macrophytes, all bacterial parameters exhibited their annual maximum. The benthic bacterial community was dependent on leachates and decay products of the submerged vegetation during this time. Temperature limitation was most probably the reason for the low biomass and production values observed during autumn and winter.

However, little is known about planktonic and epixylon communities in dynamic river-floodplain systems in winter, as previous research has focused on the spring and summer growing seasons". Therefore, changes in the diversity, abundance, and functional groups of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and epixylon in the Danube floodplain (Kopacki Rit Nature Park) were studied. In winter (January - March), water surfaces were covered only by a thin and patchy ice cover. Plankton and epixylon were diverse and abundant, and the changes in functional groups described the conditions prevailing in the studied waters well. The relatively stable conditions at the beginning of the study favoured the development of phytoplankton (diatoms, cryptophytes, ochrophytes), and epixylic taxa (diatoms, cyanobacteria) both belong to functional groups characteristic of shallow, turbid waters. Intense flooding and high grazing pressure reduced phytoplankton and epixylon abundance. The zooplankton community changed mainly due to the flood regime, subsequent nutrient loading, and food sources. Microfilter-feeding rotifers depended on phytoplankton, whereas microphytes that developed on epixylon were more important to the community for larger rotifers.

J	Dong, A; Yu, XF; Yin, Y; Zhao, K				Dong, Ang; Yu, Xiangfei; Yin, Yong; Zhao, Ke			Seasonal Variation Characteristics and the Factors Affecting Plankton Community Structure in the Yitong River, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												To explore how environmental factors affected the plankton structure in the Yitong River, we surveyed the water environmental factors and plankton population in different seasons. The results showed high total nitrogen concentrations in Yitong River throughout the year, while the total phosphorus, water temperature (WT), and chemical oxygen demand in summer were significantly higher than those in other seasons (p < 0.05), and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and TN/TP ratio were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than those in other seasons. There was no significant seasonal change in other environmental factors. Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta were the main phytoplankton phylum, while Protozoa and Rotifera were the main zooplankton phylum. The abundance and biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton in the summer were higher than those in other seasons. Non-Metric Multidimensional scaling methods demonstrated obvious seasonal variation of phytoplankton in summer compared to spring and winter, while the seasonal variation of the zooplankton community was not obvious. The results of the redundancy analysis showed that WT, DO and nitrate nitrogen were the main environmental factors affecting phytoplankton abundance. In contrast to environmental factors, phytoplankton was the main factor driving the seasonal variation of the zooplankton community structure. Cyanophyta were positively correlated with the changes in the plankton community.

J	Bourgeois, JC				Bourgeois, JC			Seasonal and interannual pollen variability in snow layers of arctic ice caps	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The pollen content of snow, deposited at the summit of three ice caps and a small glacier in the Canadian Arctic and at one ice cap in the Russian Arctic, was determined for periods ranging from one to 13 years. On the ice caps, boreal forest trees and low arctic shrubs account, on average, for 26% to 49% of the total pollen. On the small glacier, the assemblages are characterized by about 90% tundra pollen types. Sphagnum,, which is rare in the region, is sometimes one of the major components of the assemblages at these sites. The concentration of the various pollen types varies in the annual snow pack. The concentration of tundra pollen usually increases in the summer melt layer, but on some ice caps the highest concentrations are found in snow deposited after the melt season. Concentrations of tree/shrub pollen increase substantially in the late winter/spring snow layer and/or in the summer melt layer. The number of tree/shrub pollen reaching the ice caps varies considerably from year to year, and this variability increases with decreasing distance to treeline. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Microbial decomposition of organic matter in the bottom sediments of small lakes of the urban landscape (Lithuania)	MICROBIOLOGY												Bacterial abundance and the rates of sulfate reduction (SR) and total organic matter decomposition (D-total) were studied in the bottom sediments of nine lakes in the vicinity of Vilnius (Lithuania) during the ice-free seasons of 2006-2009. During the spring mixing of the water, aerobic processes of organic matter decomposition prevailed in the bottom sediments of most lakes, while anaerobic processes predominated (up to 80-90% D-total) in summer and early autumn. SR rates in the bottom sediments made up 0.16-2.6 and 0.09-2.0 mg S2-/(dm(3) day) for the medium-depth and shallow lakes, respectively. The highest numbers of sulfate-reducing bacteria (up to 10(6) cells/cm(3)) and SR rates were observed in summer. SR rate in mediumdepth lakes increased with development of anaerobic conditions at the bottom and elevated sulfate concentrations (up to 96.0 mg/dm(3)). In shallow lakes, where O-2 concentration at the bottom was at least 6.7 mg/L, SR rates increased with temperature and inflow of fresh organic matter, especially during cyanobacterial blooms. The average SR rates in the bottom sediments of the lakes of urbanized areas were 4 times higher than in the shallow lakes of protected areas. Accumulation of organic matter and its intensive decomposition during summer may enhance the processes of secondary eutrophication of these small and shallow lakes.																			0026-2617	1608-3237				JUL	2012	81	4					477	483		10.1134/S0026261712040091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0026261712040091													WOS:000307345900013
J	Green, DM				Green, David M.			Amphibian breeding phenology trends under climate change: predicting the past to forecast the future	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Global climate warming is predicted to hasten the onset of spring breeding by anuran amphibians in seasonal environments. Previous data had indicated that the breeding phenology of a population of Fowler's Toads (Anaxyrus fowleri) at their northern range limit had been progressively later in spring, contrary to generally observed trends in other species. Although these animals are known to respond to environmental temperature and the lunar cycle to commence breeding, the timing of breeding should also be influenced by the onset of overwintering animals' prior upward movement through the soil column from beneath the frost line as winter becomes spring. I used recorded weather data to identify four factors of temperature, rainfall and snowfall in late winter and early spring that correlated with the toads' eventual date of emergence aboveground. Estimated dates of spring emergence of the toads calculated using a predictive model based on these factors, as well as the illumination of the moon, were highly correlated with observed dates of emergence over 24 consecutive years. Using the model to estimate of past dates of spring breeding (i.e. retrodiction) indicated that even three decades of data were insufficient to discern any appreciable phenological trend in these toads. However, by employing weather data dating back to 1876, I detected a significant trend over 140years towards earlier spring emergence by the toads by less than half a day/decade, while, over the same period of time, average annual air temperature and annual precipitation had both increased. Changes in the springtime breeding phenology for late-breeding species, such as Fowler's Toads, therefore may conform to expectations of earlier breeding under global warming. Improved understanding of the environmental cues that bring organisms out of winter dormancy will enable better interpretation of long-term phenological trends.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				FEB	2017	23	2					646	656		10.1111/gcb.13390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13390								27273300					WOS:000394343300017

Comparison of some blood parameters of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) living in running and still water	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												The aim of this study was to compare some biochemical blood parameters of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) living in running or still waters. Some biochemical parameters of rainbow trout were examined, and the results were evaluated between sampling locations and according to seasonal changes. Healthy adult rainbow trout were caught from six different locations on the Bahcelik Dam Lake and the Zamanti River (Turkey). Blood samples were collected from the caudal vena cava and transferred to sample tubes. The blood serum samples were analyzed for 16 different biochemical parameters. In terms of the calculated blood parameters, no statistically significant differences were found between locations. However, seasonal changes affected the blood parameters significantly. alanine transaminase (ALT)was considerably higher in spring in fish caught from both the dam lake and the river. In the summer, aspartate transaminase (AST), Ca, urea, total protein and Fe were significantly higher than in other seasons. However, amylase was significantly lower in summer than in the other seasons. In the autumn, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglyceride were significantly higher than in the other seasons. The results obtained from this study may be useful for research in fish biology and food safety.

J	Engelhardt, C; Kirillin, G				Engelhardt, Christof; Kirillin, Georgiy			Criteria for the onset and breakup of summer lake stratification based on routine temperature measurements	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The increase in strength and duration of summer stratification in temperate lakes is a well-described sentinel of climatic change reported in numerous lake studies. The definitions of the onset of thermal stratification in early spring and its breakup during the autumn overturn are usually binary thresholds chosen on a subjective basis. However, the transition phases between mixing and stagnation (start of summer stratification) and between stagnation and mixing (end of summer stratification) are continuous processes. Therefore, the time limits of the stratified period are definition-dependent, which complicates comparison of results from different studies. An experimental determination of the duration of summer stratification needs unified criteria to decide when stratification is established and when it terminates. We demonstrate that the termination of the stratified period (start of autumn mixing) can be detected with sufficient accuracy from near bottom temperature records at the deepest point of the lake. Nevertheless, it takes days after this moment until the whole water column is mixed completely and a stability threshold is required for the end of the stratified period. To define the beginning of the stratified period, thresholds for different stability indices were suggested previously. Although the threshold choice influences the estimated duration of stratification each year, it appears not to significantly affect the long-term trends of stratification. More important than the selection of stability thresholds is therefore the quality of observational data used for analysis. Using measured data from two dimictic Lakes in Northern Germany we show that the estimation of the stratification length depends strongly on the temporal resolution of the measurements. For comparative studies which aim to verify a shift in future temperate lake stratification experimentally, we suggest (i) to use data from high-resolution water temperature probes (discarding completely data sets with weekly, biweekly or sparser sampling period), (ii) to use a consistent stability threshold (e.g. a fixed value of Schmidt stability) to derive the duration of the stratified period uniformly, and (iii) to apply standardized algorithms in large intercomparison studies to determine indices of stratification.

We used cluster analysis to characterize thermal regimes present in the Matanuska-Susitna (Mat-Su) Basin based on 10 nonredundant temperature metrics and identified the most important drivers of our thermal regimes using random forests. Our results indicated four distinct thermal regimes among the 248 site-years in the Mat-Su Basin. Over 41% of site-years had cold-stable temperatures. An additional 22% of site-years had cold-variable temperatures and the latest timing of maximum stream temperatures. Twenty-eight percent of site-years had warm-variable temperatures that remained above 13 degrees C for approximately two months. The remaining 9% of site-years had the warmest and most variable daily maximum temperatures, exceeding 18 degrees C for almost one month, indicating potential impacts to spawning and rearing salmon. Climate and landscape drivers differentiating thermal regimes included spring and summer air temperatures, spring snowpack, summer precipitation, wetlands, and lakes. Climate change projections for 2050-2069 indicated a future shift toward warm thermal regimes and a reduced portfolio of thermal diversity. These results portend negative impacts to some salmon populations and stress the importance of prioritizing actions that maintain thermal regime diversity.					; Shaftel, Rebecca/HNR-3645-2023	Shaftel, Rebecca/0000-0002-4789-4211; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2020	56	4					630	646		10.1111/1752-1688.12839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12839		MAR 2020											WOS:000520716800001
J	Vatland, S; Caudron, A				Vatland, Shane; Caudron, Arnaud			Movement and early survival of age-0 brown trout	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Complementary data on survival and movement are often missing for early life stages that are logistically challenging to track. Previous studies observed significant declines in the density of age-0 brown trout between summer and autumn in tributaries of Lake Geneva, but the cause of these declines was unknown. We hypothesised that mortality, dispersal within tributaries, early emigration to the lake or a combination of these factors was driving these seasonal declines. To evaluate these hypotheses, we used a combination of electrofishing and PIT-tag mark-recaptures from stationary and portable antennae to quantify summer-to-autumn variation in the abundance, dispersal and emigration of age-0 brown trout. Mortality was the primary cause of the reduction in abundance between summer and autumn. A small proportion (mean=0.10) of age-0 trout emigrated to Lake Geneva between July and mid-October, while the movement of trout within the study streams was minimal. True survival estimates for this same time period were relatively low at all but one site (mean=0.63). The seasonal resolution of survival estimates, paired with environmental data, allowed us to develop additional hypotheses on what factors were affecting survival. Understanding animal movement at early life stages can elucidate important aspects of population ecology while concomitantly improving the reliability of demographic data.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2015	60	7					1252	1262		10.1111/fwb.12551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12551													WOS:000356370800002

At Rust (planted with cv. Blauburgunder) the type of soil management had a highly significant effect on the nematode population. After five years of soil covering with straw, permanent green cover or green cover in winter the nematode population on average was twice as high as in bare soil and green cover during spring. The latter variants were clean cultivated in spring. Distribution of nematodes in the sloping site of Donnerskirchen (planted with cvs Gruner Veltliner and Welschriesling) turned out to be inhomogenous, depending on the site of the slope. Here soil cultivation had no significant influence on the nematode fauna.																			0042-7500					SEP	2000	39	3					135	136																WOS:000089843000010
J	STEMBERGER, RS				STEMBERGER, RS			THE INFLUENCE OF MIXING ON ROTIFER ASSEMBLAGES OF MICHIGAN LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal changes in the rotifer assemblages of 42 lakes in northern lower Michigan was closely related to lake mixing characteristics, basin morphometry, and the presence of an oxygenated coldwater refuge. Three major classes of lakes (dimictic, discontinuous polymictic, and continuous polymictic) were evident by their capacity to maintain coldwater species as seasons progressed from winter through fall. The disappearance of coldwater assemblages from dimictic lakes coincided with oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion or with erosion of the hypolimnion through mixing. Coldwater species disappeared from large discontinuous polymictic lakes when deep epilimnetic mixing occurred in late summer and fall. Species assemblages of nearly all stratified lakes converged with those of continuous polymictic lakes when the hypolimnetic refuge deteriorated in summer and fall. Local weather conditions, however, between years had a pronounced effect on the persistence of cold water species through the seasons by affecting the temperature and oxygen conditions of the hypolimnion. Large lakes of the region contain many of the coldwater species of the Laurentian Great Lakes but some taxa are conspicuously absent. Cold stenothermal rotifers persist in the lakes of the region despite adverse environmental conditions. Their life histories and ability to form resting stages permit them to escape periods of oxygen depletion and thermal stress. In contrast, the crustacean glacial marine fauna (i.e. Mysis relicta, Limnocalanus macrurus, and Scenecella calanoides) was absent from all of the study lakes even though many of the present-day basins were once connected to the Laurentian Great Lakes. These species long life cycles, lack of diapausing stages, and limited dispersal may make them vulnerable to local extinction with the deterioration and loss of the coldwater refuge.																			0018-8158					FEB 10	1995	297	2					149	161		10.1007/BF00017481	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017481													WOS:A1995QJ79400005

Year-round sampling of the fish community in a boreal lake: differences between summer and winter influence estimates of species composition, catch, and fish size	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Boreal lakes experience pronounced seasonal variation in abiotic factors, especially light, temperature, and oxygen. A deep boreal humic lake was sampled year-round to test putative changes in total fish catch, species composition, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), habitat use, fish size, and condition. Monthly sampling was conducted in Lake P & auml;& auml;j & auml;rvi, southern Finland, during one full year in 2020-2021 as well as in March and August 2021 and 2022. The fish community was dominated by cyprinid species in all months, but the percentage of percid fish caught increased during the warm summer period. Most fish were caught in littoral habitats and the highest catches occurred in summer, but some species (e.g., ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernua, and pikeperch, Sander lucioperca) remained abundant in the winter catch. The body size of fish was larger in the winter catch, while condition factor was higher in summer for most species. Fish species proportions in total catch, CPUE, and average size of fish were closest to the annual mean values in September, which may be used as the optimal period to monitor fish communities of similar deep boreal lakes. Our findings highlight the need for year-round research to reveal the impacts of rising temperatures and diminishing ice-covered periods in fish communities and lake food webs.

The changes in the vertical distributions of red coloured Planktothrix rubescens and green P. agardhii filaments in Blelham Tarn, English Lake District, were related to vertical profiles of temperature and light attenuation and to continuous records of the surface irradiance and windspeed, from August 1999 to October 2000. 2. The potential growth rate of each organism was calculated from the irradiance and temperature at 0.5 m depths and hourly intervals throughout the year, using algorithms determined from growth rates in culture. The analyses indicated that there was sufficient irradiance for growth, integrated over the 24-h cycle, at depths down to the metalimnion where the Planktothrix populations stratified in summer. The compensation depth for growth by P. rubescens reached a maximum of 9.3 m in spring and midsummer, and fell to a minimum of 1.6 m in midwinter; the corresponding values for P. agardhii were 7.9 and 0.5 m. 3. The mixed depth (z(m)) exceeded the critical depth for growth (z(b)) by P. rubescens (the condition preventing population increase) on only 3 days of the year; for P. agardhii , however, z(m) exceeded z(b) on 31 days, contributing to its faster decline. The stratified population of P. rubescens was the major cause of light attenuation during the summer of 2000, and resulted in competitive exclusion of P. agardhii. 4. The calculated growth rates integrated over the depth of the water column in Blelham Tarn equalled, or exceeded, the measured changes of the populations during periods when they were increasing, during summer and autumn. Close agreement between the two values was found for much of the year when allowance was made for dilution of the lake population by rainfall over the watershed. During periods of rapid decline, of P. agardhii in September 1999, P. rubescens in December 1999 and both in July-August 2000, additional losses (e.g. by chytrid parasitism and grazing) are invoked.																			0046-5070					MAY	2003	48	5					852	867		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01055.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01055.x													WOS:000182183600009

The distance separating individuals in schools during summer was less than 1.5-2.0 ft, consequently producing dense traces on the recorder charts which showed no definition of individuals. During winter, however, the fish-to-fish distances often were greater than 1.5-2.0 ft, producing many traces showing the individual fishes in a school. The mean distance between the top and bottom fish in a school during winter was 22.1 ft (6.7 m); in summer only 8.5 ft (2.5 m). High correlations existed between light transmission of the water and school size (r = .77) and between temperature and school size (r = [long dash].89). The possible adaptive significance of this seasonal change in behavior is discussed.																									1968	25	4					711	+		10.1139/f68-065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f68-065													WOS:A1968A942800007

High-performance liquid chromatography (HLPC) results show that the total chlorophyll concentration was 36,418.62 mg/m(3), and the contribution rates of microplankton, nanoplankton, and picoplankton to the total biomass were 13.43%, 49.08%, and 37.49%, respectively. Fucoxanthin, alloxanthin, zeaxanthin, and chlorophyll b were the main photosynthetic pigments. However, the spatial and temporal distribution had significant differences in the four typical lakes. Chemical taxonomy (CHEMTAX) calculation indicates that the dominant species were Diatoms and Cryptophytes in spring, Euglenophytes in summer, Euglenophytes and Cyanobacteria in autumn, and Euglenophytes and Cryptophytes in winter. The Chrysophyte and Dinoflagellates have the lowest proportion for all seasons. The redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrates that the key environmental factors for the succession were Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP). The application of the HPLC-CHEMTAX method has provided the first analysis of the community structure of size-fractionized phytoplankton in typical lakes of Hubei Southeast, China, and environmental factors affect the succession of size- fractionized phytoplankton over time.

J	Rodríguez, P; Vera, MS; Pizarro, H				Rodriguez, Patricia; Solange Vera, M.; Pizarro, Haydee			Primary production of phytoplankton and periphyton in two humic lakes of a South American wetland	LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal primary productivities of periphyton and phytoplankton were compared in Grande Lake (GL) and a relict oxbow lake (ROL) in winter 2006 and summer 2007. GL was free of floating plants on the sampling dates and covered over 80 and 100% of the ROL surface in winter and summer, respectively. The C-14 assimilation technique was used to obtain the P-E curves of phytoplankton and periphyton on artificial substrata. The periphytic maximum photosynthetic rate (P (max)) was higher in the ROL in winter and summer, being better adapted to low irradiances than those in the GL. Phytoplankton and periphytic algae were light-limited in the ROL in summer due to complete coverage by floating macrophytes. In summer, P (max) and alpha values for periphyton in the ROL were higher than those for phytoplankton, and were even higher than in GL. In turn, P (max) and alpha values for phytoplankton in Grande Lake were higher than those for periphyton due to improved light conditions and the presence of algae that were adapted to movement through the water column. These results suggest that the complete coverage by floating macrophytes restricted phytoplankton productivity and allowed the development of a periphytic community that was better adapted to low-light conditions.

J	Karakus, P				Karakus, Pinar			Investigation of Meteorological Effects on Civril Lake, Turkey, with Sentinel-2 Data on Google Earth Engine Platform	SUSTAINABILITY												Lakes and reservoirs, comprising surface water bodies that vary significantly seasonally, play an essential role in the global water cycle due to their ability to hold, store, and clean water. They are crucial to our planet's ecology and climate systems. This study analyzed Harmonized Sentinel-2 images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to examine the short-term changes in the surface water bodies of civril Lake from March 2018 to March 2023 with meteorological data and lake surface water temperature (LSWT). This study used the Sentinel-2 Level-2A archive, a cloud filter, the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDWI (normalized difference water index), MNDWI (modified NDWI), and SWI (Sentinel water index) methods on lake surfaces utilizing the GEE platform and the random forests (RFs) method to calculate the water surface areas. The information on the water surfaces collected between March 2018 and March 2023 was used to track the trend of changes in the lake's area. The seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) yearly and monthly changes in water areas were identified. Precipitation, evaporation, and temperature are gathered meteorological parameters that impact the observed variation in surface water bodies for the same area. The correlations between the lake area reduction and the chosen meteorological parameters revealed a strong positive or negative significant association. Meteorological parameters and human activities selected during different seasons, months, and years have directly affected the shrinkage of the lake area.

J	Carlson, SP; Poole, GC				Carlson, Samuel P.; Poole, Geoffrey C.			Describing alpine lake influence on stream network temperatures: A statistical modelling approach	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Systematic variations in atmospheric heat exchange, surface residence time, and groundwater influx across montane stream networks commonly produce an increasing stream temperature trend with decreasing elevation. However, complex stream temperature profiles that differ from this common longitudinal trend also exist, suggesting that stream temperatures may be influenced by complex interactions among hydrologic and atmospheric processes. Lakes within stream networks form one potential source of temperature profile complexity due to the spatially variable contribution of lake-sourced water to stream flow. We investigated temperature profile complexity in a multi-season stream temperature dataset collected across a montane stream network containing many alpine lakes. This investigation was performed by making comparisons between multiple statistical models that used different combinations of stream and lake characteristics to represent specific hypotheses for the controls on stream temperature. The compared models included a set of models which used a topographically derived estimate of the hydrologic influence of lakes to separate and quantify the effects of stream elevation and lake source-water contributions to longitudinal stream temperature patterns. This source-water mixing model provided a parsimonious explanation for complex stream-network temperature patterns in the summer and autumn, and this approach may be further applicable to other systems where stream temperatures are influenced by multiple water sources. Simpler models that discounted lake effects were more optimal during the winter and spring, suggesting that complex patterns in stream temperature profiles may emerge and subside temporally, across seasons, in response to diversity of water temperatures from different sources.

Thus, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was employed to evaluate the impact of eleven commonly practiced management scenarios on ecosystem services in the Western Lake Erie Basin, USA, from 1998-2020. Out of eleven scenarios, eight were focused on corn-soybean rotations with varied nitrogen application timing (50% before planting and 50% at either fall or spring during or after planting), or nitrogen source (dairy slurry or synthetic fertilizer (SF)), or tillage practices (conventional, no-till), or cereal rye (CR) in rotation. Remaining scenarios involved rotations with silage corn (SC), winter crops (CR or winter wheat), and alfalfa. The silage corn with winter crop and four years of alfalfa rotation demonstrated enhanced ecosystem services compared to equivalent scenario with three years of alfalfa. Applying half the total nitrogen to corn through SF during or after spring-planted corn increased yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration while raising global warming potential (GWP) than fall-applied nitrogen. The no-till practice offered environmental benefits with lower GWP and higher SOC sequestration, while resulting in lower yield than conventional tillage. The incorporation of CR into corn-soybean rotations enhanced carbon sequestration, increased GHG emissions, improved corn yield, and lowered soybean yield. Substituting SF with manure for corn production improved corn yield under conventional tillage and increased SOC while increasing GWP under both tillage conditions. While the role of conservation practices varies by site, this study's findings aid in prioritizing practices by evaluating tradeoffs among a range of ecosystem services.

Chlorophyll-a (Chla), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, can be monitored over large areas and long periods using satellite imagery. However, satellites struggle to monitor synoptic-scale diurnal changes due to the vertical migration of algae, which introduces significant uncertainty in Chla concentration estimates. In this study, we conducted high frequency UAV-based hyperspectral observations of a typical inland water body, developed a Chla inversion model using XGBoost and feature selection methods, and investigated diurnal Chla variation patterns and their drivers. The results revealed significant diurnal Chla variations (23.9 %-35.3 %) during spring, summer, and autumn, whereas no significant change in winter. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis identified total phosphorus, air temperature, and solar radiation as key drivers of Chla changes, while wind speed had minimal impact. This study highlights the influence of both short-term weather conditions and long-term climate change on Chla variability, affecting algal bloom frequency and distribution. UAV remote sensing proves effective for tracking short-term Chla changes at synoptic scales. Future synergistic UAV-satellite monitoring could improve aquatic environmental management.

J	Uusi-Kämppä, J; Jauhiainen, L				Uusi-Kamppa, Jaana; Jauhiainen, Lauri			Long-term monitoring of buffer zone efficiency under different cultivation techniques in boreal conditions	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Vegetative buffer zones (BZs) between fields and watercourses are one way to minimize phosphorus (P) losses from fields to surface runoff and thus decrease eutrophication and blue-green algal blooms in lakes and coastal waters. A 6-plot experimental field was established in clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) in SW Finland in 1991 to study long-term changes in functioning of BZs and their retention capacity for total solids (TS), total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and particulate P (PP) in different seasons. The steep slope in lower sections of four plots (18 m wide x 70 m long) was planted with 10-m-wide mowed grass buffer zones (GBZ) or unmowed vegetated buffer zones (VBZ) growing natural herbage and shrubs. Surface runoff water samples from the GBZ and VBZ plots were compared to samples from plots cultivated without a buffer (NBZ). The source field area in all plots and the steep slope (12-18%) on the NBZ were ploughed in autumn, and sown with barley (Hordeum vulgare) or oats (Avena sativa) in spring (conventional tillage, 1991-2001), sown with grass and grazed (72-234 cow grazing days ha(-1) yr(-1); 2003-2005) and direct drilled without tillage (2006-2008). Surface soil samples (0-2 cm) were taken from the BZs in autumn and spring to evaluate the level of plant-available P (P-Ac) extracted with 0.5 M NH4-acetate-0.5 M acetic acid at pH 4.65. The BZs were most effective at decreasing TS, TP and PP with conventional tillage, less so with direct drilling and least effective with grazing. In a conventionally tilled field, the TS and TP removal efficiencies were over 50% and 27-36%, respectively, for the BZs as compared to the NBZ. In the VBZ plots, the DRP load was, however, 60% greater than in the NBZ or GBZ plots. In direct drilling, the surface runoff losses were smaller than in conventionally tilled NBZ plots. The lowest losses of TS, TP and PP were found during grazing for all plots, but with grazing the DRP load, 0.3-0.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), was higher than during grain growing in all treatments. The GBZ and VBZ were effective in retaining P in summer and autumn, whereas in spring their retention capacity was decreased. The reason for high DRP losses in spring was the high P-Ac in surface soil and frozen broken plant tissues in the VBZ and the grazed source field. Mowing and removing of swathe from the GBZ decreased the DRP losses. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal Si:C ratios in Lake Erie diatoms - Evidence of an active winter diatom community	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recent investigations of Lake Erie in the winter have demonstrated the occurrence of substantial phytoplankton communities largely consisting of the diatom Aulacoseira islandica (O. Muller) Simonsen. To assess the activity of this diatom community, multiple measures of production, both general and diatom-specific, were undertaken. We measured oxygen (O-2) evolution as proxy for carbon (C)-fixation and 2-(4-pyridyl)-5-((4-(2-dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl) methoxy)-phenyl)oxazole (PDMPO) incorporation as a measure of silica (Si) deposition. The latter demonstrated conclusively that diatoms were active during winter months and confirmed that diatoms are the primary drivers of winter productivity. The stoichiometric relationship between carbon and silica in the winter Lake Erie phytoplankton assemblage was further compared to the activity of the summer community. Although the winter phytoplankton community was observed to be active, it was less active than the summer community, with lower measured rates of O-2 evolution and Si deposition. These findings provide a new and expanded understanding of the biological carbon production in Lake Erie. (C) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Traut, AH; Hostetler, ME				Traut, AH; Hostetler, ME			Urban lakes and waterbirds: effects of shoreline development on avian distribution	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The need to understand how wildlife responds to the broad-ranging impacts of development is becoming increasingly important as human populations around the globe continue to increase and urbanize. We examined waterbird distributional associations with shoreline development, and with littoral and onshore habitat elements on four partially developed urban lakes in central Florida. A total of 34 waterbird species were observed over the summer and winter seasons. Wading bird, marsh bird, and duck abundance was significantly greater than expected along developed shoreline in both seasons on all lakes. Diving bird abundance was significantly greater along developed shoreline in the winter. Species richness was not associated with shoreline development, while species evenness varied by season, being greater along undeveloped shoreline in the summer and along developed shoreline in the winter. Tall-emergent vegetation, open shore, lawn, and canopy appeared to be the primary habitat elements determining waterbird distribution. All guilds were negatively associated with tall-emergent vegetation on two or more lakes over both seasons, whereas wading birds, marsh birds, and ducks were positively associated with open shore in the summer, and wading birds, marsh birds, and diving birds were positively associated with lawn and canopy in the winter. Results showed that a wide range of waterbirds can use urban lakes during the summer and winter seasons, and many individuals can utilize developed shoreline in particular. However, the lack of birds observed along undeveloped shoreline may be explained by the abundance of dense tall-emergent vegetation found along this shoreline. Both littoral and onshore habitat elements should be managed to improve waterbird habitat on urban lakes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our study provides a clear understanding of the water quality in the rivers of Lake Taihu Basin based on basin-scale monitoring and a water quality index (WQI) method. From September 2014 to January 2016, four samplings across four seasons were conducted at 96 sites along main rivers. Fifteen parameters, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, turbidity (tur), permanganate index (CODMn), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonium (NH4-N), nitrite, nitrate (NO3-N), calcium, magnesium, chloride, and sulfate, were measured to calculate the WQI. The average WQI value during our study period was 59.33; consequently, the water quality was considered as generally "moderate". Significant differences in WQI values were detected among the 6 river systems, with better water quality in the Tiaoxi and Nanhe systems. The water quality presented distinct seasonal variation, with the highest WQI values in autumn, followed by spring and summer, and the lowest values in winter. The minimum WQI (WQI(min)), which was developed based on a stepwise linear regression analysis, consisted of five parameters: NH4-N, CODMn, NO3-N, DO, and tur. The model exhibited excellent performance in representing the water quality in Lake Taihu Basin, especially when weights were fully considered. Our results are beneficial for water quality management and could be used for rapid and low-cost water quality evaluation in Lake Taihu Basin. Additionally, we suggest that weights of environmental parameters should be fully considered in water quality assessments when using the WQI(min) method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abundances of 26 species occurring in the plankton, as well as physical and chemical parameters (water temperature, O2, total phosphorus, SRP, NO3- , NO2- NH4+, chlorophyll a) were determined at different depths. Erosion of the hypolimnion due to autumnal storms and decrease in temperature was interrupted by fine weather periods with the occurrence of re-stratification, thus allowing mass production of algae and rotifers (Synchaeta oblonga, S. tremula, Keratella cochlearis) through exploitation of newly available nutrients. Warm stenothermal 'summer species' (e.g. Pompholyx sulcata, Trichocerca pusilla, Liliferotrocha subtilis) became less abundant as a consequence of the progressive mixing process, whereas the appearance of new species was a rare event. The late summer occurrence of Liliferotrocha subtilis in the fraction < 30 mum (up to 3500 ind. l-1) is remarkable. Keratella cochlearis showed morphological variation from spineless summer forms to spine-bearing autumnal forms, the latter particularly dominating the deeper water layers. The prevailing phenomenon was the dramatic decrease of the total number of individuals and of species towards completion of autumnal turnover. The impact of falling temperature, increasing mixing depth and mass production of phytoplankton on the rotifer plankton community is discussed.

Leeches produced a brood in May, and then died. A proportion of their offspring were breeding in July and August, the remainder reproduced the following spring. Those leeches hatched in August also reproduced in spring. Helobdella has a marked annual rhythm of rapid growth in summer and slow growth in winter; reaches maturity at a low body weight and produces small broods. This annual rhythm corresponds with annual rhythm of growth and decay of plants on which it lives. Pattern of survival shows about 95% mortality in the 1st 3 months of life, followed by period of reduced mortality. Biotic potential of Helobdella is high which accounts for its being the most numerous spp. in eutrophic lakes.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1957	26	1					171	177		10.2307/1787	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1787													WOS:A1957WV74700007

Sampling for active biomonitoring and physicochemical variables was performed weekly. The control was obtained from the outdoor pool of the Institute of Hydrobiology, China. Superoxide dismutase, lipoperoxidation, metallothioneins, acetylcholinesterase activity, and Vtg mRNA expression were determined as biomarkers during the field exposure period. Survival and growth also were monitored to evaluate the overall physiological condition of the fish. The seasonal changes of organic pollutants and trace metals (As, Hg, Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) in surface water were determined. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) index was applied to summarize biomarker responses and correlate stress levels with concentrations of organic pollutants and trace metals in the surface water. Results indicated that complex pollution by persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals was present in Donghu Lake and that the in situ exposed organisms were stressed. Moreover, the complex pollution of Donghu Lake in summer and autumn was more serious than that in spring and winter. Active biomonitoring combined with IBR analysis enabled good discrimination among different exposure seasons. The proposed protocol with caged rare minnow revealed marked biological effects caused by the investigated Lake and a useful approach that can easily be extended to monitor water pollution.

Up to 7000-10,000 great crested grebes [Podiceps cristatus] may be present on the lake, representing .apprx. 1/2 of the northwestern European breeding population. In winter 1000 to 3000 red-breasted mergansers [Mergus serrator] also forage here; in summer and early autumn 500 to 800 cormorants [Phalacrocorax carbo] can be found. From Dec. 1981-March 1982 food habits of the grebes and mergansers were studied by means of stomach analyses. Total annual consumption of the 2 fish-eating birds was .apprx. 46.6 and 39.2 tons fresh weight [FW], respectively. Gobiidae was the main food source, 60% of total intake (by weight). Grebes consumed 9.9 tons of Clupea harengus and mergansers 11.0 tons of brown shrimps Crangon crangon. Birds tended to select larger specimens of Gobiidae and C. crangon. Estimated amount of food consumed by these 2 bird species is .apprx. 28 to 36% of the standing stocks of Gobiidae, C. harengus and Sprattus sprattus present at the arrival of the birds in Sept./Oct.

Insolation forcing of Holocene climate change in Southern California: a sediment study from Lake Elsinore	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lake Elsinore is the largest natural lake in Southern California. As such, the lake provides a unique opportunity to investigate terrestrial climate on timescales otherwise underrepresented in the region's terrestrial environment. In November 2003, three similar to 10 m drill cores were extracted from the depocenter region of Lake Elsinore. These drill cores, spanning the past 9,500-11,200 calendar years, represent the first complete Holocene record of terrestrial climate from Southern California. In this paper, we focus on two adjacent, depocenter cores (LEGC03-2 and LEGC03-3), which have been correlated to develop a single composite core. Twenty-two AMS C-14 dates on bulk organic matter and one cross-correlated exotic pollen age constitute the composite core's age control. Several methods of analysis, including mass magnetic susceptibility, % total organic matter, % total carbonate, % HCl-extractable Al, and total inorganic P are used to infer climate for the past 9,500 calendar years in Southern California. Together, these data indicate a wet early Holocene followed by a long-term drying trend. Recent lake-level reconstructions from Owens Lake and Tulare Lake support our contention for a wetter-than-today early Holocene. Lacustrine sediments from the Mojave Desert also support our conclusions. We suggest that over the duration of the Holocene changing summer/winter insolation alters the region's long-term hydrologic balance through its modulation of atmospheric circulation and its associated storm tracks. Minimum early Holocene winter insolation and maximum summer insolation act together to increase the region's total annual precipitation by increasing the frequency of winter storms as well as enhancing the magnitude and spatial extent of the North American monsoon, the frequency of land-falling tropical cyclones in Southern California, and regional convective storms, respectively. Gradual decreases in summer insolation and increases in winter insolation produce the opposite effect with maximum drying in the late Holocene.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2007	38	3					395	417		10.1007/s10933-006-9085-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9085-7													WOS:000249406400006

The Copepoda contributed to the total Crustacea biomass by a major ratio. The values of the Crustacea biomass were the highest in the summer and autumn periods, when the values of the Copepoda and Cladocera biomass were similar. Considerable increase in the Crustacea biomass was recorded during the summer period 2004, which resulted from the relatively high biomass values of the Copepoda, especially the Calanoida. High values of the Crustacea biomass were found also in the summer and autumn period 2008-2009, when the biomass of the Cladocera considerably increased in comparison with the other studied periods that imply considerable changes in zooplankton community.																			0324-0770					MAR	2019				13			63	67																WOS:000472245600010

A soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model is developed, calibrated, and validated in a base-period. The model is able to simulate the monthly streamflow dynamics with Good' to Very Good' accuracy. The calibrated and validated model is then subjected with daily bias-corrected future climatic data from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4). Five bias-correction methods and their 12 combinations were evaluated using the Climate Model data for hydrologic modeling (CMhyd). Distribution mapping (DM) performed the best and was used for further analysis. Two future time-periods and two IPCC AR5 representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are considered. Results showed marked temporal and spatial variability in precipitation (-37% to +63%) and temperature (-3 degrees C to +14 degrees C) changes, which are reflected in evapotranspiration (-52% to +412%) and soil water storage (-60% to +12%) changes, resulting in heterogeneity in streamflow (-77% to +170%) changes. On average, increases in winter (+11%), and decreases in spring (-33%), summer (-23%), and autumn (-15%) streamflow are expected in future. This is the first work of this kind in the NLE and such marked variability in water resources availability poses considerable challenges to water resources planners and managers.

However, microbial communities undergoing graphene photocatalysis treatment in freshwater lakes have been poorly studied. Here, using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, the responses of microbial communities to graphene photocatalysis were analyzed in the eutrophic lake, Lake Xinyun, southwestern China. For microeukaryotes, we found that Arthropoda was dominant in summer, while its abundant level declined in spring under natural conditions. The evident reduction of Arthropods was observed after graphene photocatalysis treatment in summer and then reached a relatively stable level. For bacteria, Cyanobacteria decreased in summer due to the graphene photocatalysis-mediated inactivation. However, Cyanobacteria was higher in the treated group in spring with a genera group-shift. Functional analysis revealed that microeukaryotes showed higher potential for fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle in the treated group in summer, but they were more abundant in control in spring. Pathways of starch and sucrose metabolism and galactose metabolism were more abundant in control in summer, while they were enriched in the treated group in spring for bacteria. This study offers insights into the effects of graphene photocatalysis on microbial communities and their functional potential in eutrophic lake.

J	Lee, E; Sagong, J; Lee, YH				Lee, Eunjae; Sagong, Junghee; Lee, Yohan			Influence of land use change on the waterbird community of Sihwa Lake, Republic of Korea	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background Land use and development alter mudflat and wetland habitat availability, although mudflats and wetlands provide important stopover habitats for shorebirds during the spring and autumn migrations and support communities of ducks and geese during the winter months in the Republic of Korea. This study investigated land use changes around Sihwa Lake (Republic of Korea) and evaluated the effect of these changes on waterbird community characteristics. Methods We conducted a land-use-change analysis at the medium-resolution level using land cover maps for 2001, 2007, 2009, and 2014. Also, a tidal stream survey was conducted in Sihwa Lake and the surrounding reclaimed mudflats every season for 10 years (2003-2012) to identify the seasonal and interannual variations in waterbird species composition. To determine the total annual waterbird species and population counts, species diversity index, and interspecies variations, a TRIM (trends and indices for monitoring data) analysis was used. Results Wetland area decreased more than 10% while agricultural land, barren land, and grassland area increased more than 10% due to continuous reclamation activities around Sihwa Lake. Barren land later turned into agricultural land or other land use. Sixty-three species and 566,623 individuals were recorded. The number of species, population size, and species diversity index by year and by species showed decreasing trends that were more marked in spring and summer. Furthermore, seasonal and annual variations in waterbird species composition showed decreasing trends in dabbling ducks, herons, grebes, and shorebirds but diving ducks displayed increasing trends. In particular, shorebirds were reduced to a greater extent than other waterbird species because of the reduction and simplification of the intertidal zone, and shallow waters caused by reclamation and road construction. Conclusions Increased development and construction around Sihwa Lake has altered migratory shorebird populations with a general decline in species diversity and population size. The greatest decline was observed in wading birds, while diving duck populations showed increasing trends.

J	Dokulil, MT; Herzig, A				Dokulil, Martin T.; Herzig, Alois			An analysis of long-term winter data on phytoplankton and zooplankton in Neusiedler See, a shallow temperate lake, Austria	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					1st International Winter Limnology Symposium	MAY 24-28, 2008	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLAND	Univ Jyvaskyla, Univ Joensuu, Univ Helsinki	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn			In the last 40 years, the shallow steppe lake, Neusiedler See, was ice covered between 0 and 97 days. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as well as the Mediterranean Oscillation affected the lake and its conditions during winter. Both climate indices correlated negatively with the duration of ice cover and the timing of ice-out. Average winter phytoplankton biomass increased from less than 0.2 (0.05-0.84) mg FM l(-1) in the late 1960s/beginning of 1970s to 3.1 (1.72-5.61) mg FM l(-1) in the years 2001-2004. The increase in annual winter biomass of phytoplankton was associated with a significant shift in the composition of the algal assemblage. In the winter 1997/1998, diatoms contributed between 40 and 80% to the phytoplankton biomass while in 2006/2007 cyanoprokaryotes contributed 46%. Mean chlorophyll-a concentrations during winter were significantly correlated with those of total phosphorus (P-tot). Together with cold-water species (rotifer Rhinoglena fertoensis), perennial, eurythermal ones (copepod Arctodiaptomus spinosus) contributed to the zooplankton community. High zooplankton numbers were encountered when rotifers, particularly when densities of Rhinoglena fertoensis were high (r (2) = 0.928). Zooplankton abundance and biomass varied from year to year but correlated positively with Chl-a (biomass - r (2) = 0.69; numbers - r (2) = 0.536). Winter zooplankton populations were primarily influenced by winter conditions, but in early winter also by survival of autumn populations, i.e., the more adults of Arctodiaptomus spinosus survived into winter, the higher was the zooplankton biomass in early winter. Phyto- and zooplankton dynamics in shallow lakes of the temperate region seem to critically depend on the biomass in autumn and on winter conditions, specifically on ice conditions and thus are related to climate signals such as the NAO.

This, limits our understanding of the organic matter process that occurs in inland waters and thus the carbon cycle. With the aim of improving the knowledge of CDOM degradation rates and times, a total of 45 field samples were used to conduct this study. Twenty-three samples were used for the calibration process and other twenty-two for validation, obtaining a R2 of 0.87 and an RRMSE of 13%. Finally, all samples were used to obtain a more robust algorithm. The CDOM degradation rates calculated for reservoirs in the summer period, with a hydraulic residence time of 30-40 days, were in agreement with the rates obtained in laboratory experiments, whereas with higher residence times other autochthonous or allochthonous factors began to have influence. Annual variations in the CDOM degradation rate exhibited the maximum value in spring, simply because more degradable CDOM was present in springtime water, and the minimum values in autumn and winter, with less light degradation and the increased entry of more recalcitrant allochthonous CDOM, a result coinciding with those of other studies using laboratory experiments.

Nine Maxims for the Ecology of Cold-Climate Winters	BIOSCIENCE												Frozen winters define life at high latitudes and altitudes. However, recent, rapid changes in winter conditions have highlighted our relatively poor understanding of ecosystem function in winter relative to other seasons. Winter ecological processes can affect reproduction, growth, survival, and fitness, whereas processes that occur during other seasons, such as summer production, mediate how organisms fare in winter. As interest grows in winter ecology, there is a need to clearly provide a thought-provoking framework for defining winter and the pathways through which it affects organisms. In the present article, we present nine maxims (concise expressions of a fundamentally held principle or truth) for winter ecology, drawing from the perspectives of scientists with diverse expertise. We describe winter as being frozen, cold, dark, snowy, less productive, variable, and deadly. Therefore, the implications of winter impacts on wildlife are striking for resource managers and conservation practitioners. Our final, overarching maxim, "winter is changing," is a call to action to address the need for immediate study of the ecological implications of rapidly changing winters.

Ecological restoration of the estuary reduced common pollutants (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water, whereas varia-tions in ARGs showed noticeable seasonal and spatial features. The absolute abundance of ARGs at sampling site #2 considerably increased in autumn and winter, while it significantly increased at sampling site #3 in spring and summer. The strong intervention of biological treatment (from #1 to #2) and aerators (from #2 to #3) in the estuary substantially affected the distribution of ARGs and dominant antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). The dominant ARB (Thiobacillus) in estuarine sediments may have low abundance but important dissemination roles. Meanwhile, redundancy and network analysis revealed that the microbial communities and intl1 were key factors related to ARG dissemination, which was affected by spatial and seasonal ecological restoration. A positive correlation between low flow velocity and certain ARGs (tetM, tetW, tetA, sul2, and ermC) was observed, implying that flow optimization should also be considered in future ecological restoration to remediate ARGs. Further-more, the absolute abundance of ARGs can be utilized as an index to evaluate the removal capacity of ARGs by estuarine restoration.					; Chen, Haoqiang/HPD-8604-2023; Xu, Ming/IWM-0504-2023; Gao, Peng/F-7848-2018; Shen, Xiaoxiao/OGR-3344-2025; Zhang, Yanyan/JFA-9161-2023	Chen, Hao-qiang/0000-0003-2549-8696; Gao, Peng/0000-0002-7579-5210; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 1	2023	335								117472	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117472		FEB 2023						36827800					WOS:000946518900001

Zooplankton-population dynamics in the Salado-River basin (Buenos Aires, Argentina) in relation to hydraulic works and resulting wetland function	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The construction of drainage canals in the upper stretch of the Salado River has caused the input of salty waters into the basin, with unexplored consequences on zooplankton dynamics and reproduction. To determine the consequences of those anthropic interventions, zooplankton samples were taken under four hydrologic conditions (high water, mean flows, low flows, very low flows) in the canals and the river watercourse. Environmental variables were measured in situ (pH, temperature, conductivity, turbidity, flow velocity, water level, dissolved-oxygen concentration) and in the laboratory (chlorophyll a, nutrients). A total of 166 zooplankton taxa was identified, among which rotifers and ciliates were the most diverse and abundant. A redundancy analysis indicated temperature, conductivity, and water discharge to be the main constraints to zooplankton development. Accordingly, abundance peaks were recorded during mean and low flows in the spring and summer, and minimum values during high water (autumn-winter floodings). The dominant species, Brachionus plicatilis s.l., recorded outstanding densities at ca. 34,800 ind L-1-that figure representing a worldwide novelty-during low flows in the canals and at the river downstream site. The wetlands and shallow lakes in the study area acted as sources of inocula for the river, increasing the total abundance of zooplankton, gravid females, nauplii, copepodites, juveniles, and total number of eggs being carried at the second river site downstream from the canals' discharges. The presence of diverse habitats coupled with the alternation of hydrologic conditions have resulted in the development of a very rich, complex zooplankton community.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				APR 25	2020	82	3							48	10.1007/s00027-020-00720-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-00720-4													WOS:000529976800001

Study of seasonal variations and health risk assessment of heavy metals in Cyprinus carpio from Rawal Lake, Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study was carried out to find out the comparative distribution of heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Co, Cr, Cd and Pb) in various tissues (muscles, gills, liver, stomach and intestine) of Cyprinus carpio from Rawal Lake, Pakistan, during summer and winter. Relatively higher concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn were found in the stomach samples, while the highest Pb and Zn levels were noted in muscle and intestine samples, respectively. Correlation study exhibited diverse relationships among the metals in various tissues. Generally, the metal concentrations found during the summer were comparatively higher than the winter. Potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks related to the metals in C. carpio were evaluated using the US Environmental Protection Agency approved cancer risk assessment guidelines. The calculated daily and weekly intakes of Pb, Cd, Cr and Co through the fish consumption were significantly higher than the permissible limits. In relation to the non-carcinogenic risks to human, Pb, Cd, Cr, Co and Zn levels were higher than the safe limits; however, carcinogenic risks related to Cr (3.9 x 10(-3) during summer and 1.1 x 10(-3) during winter) and Pb (2.6 x 10(-4) during summer and 1.5 x 10(-4) during winter) clearly exceeded the safe limit (1 x 10(-6)). Consequently, the consumption of C. carpio from Rawal Lake on regular basis was considered unsafe.					; Shah, Munir/K-3191-2012; Iqbal, Javed/MVW-3768-2025	Shah, Munir H./0000-0003-4445-4293; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2014	186	4					2025	2037		10.1007/s10661-013-3515-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3515-6								24213637					WOS:000332150800003

Relationships between aquatic vegetation and water turbidity: A field survey across seasons and spatial scales	PLOS ONE												Field surveys often show that high water turbidity limits cover of aquatic vegetation, while many small-scale experiments show that vegetation can reduce turbidity by decreasing water flow, stabilizing sediments, and competing with phytoplankton for nutrients. Here we bridged these two views by exploring the direction and strength of causal relationships between aquatic vegetation and turbidity across seasons (spring and late summer) and spatial scales (local and regional), using causal modeling based on data from a field survey along the central Swedish Baltic Sea coast. The two best-fitting regional-scale models both suggested that in spring, high cover of vegetation reduces water turbidity. In summer, the relationships differed between the two models; in the first model high vegetation cover reduced turbidity; while in the second model reduction of summer turbidity by high vegetation cover in spring had a positive effect on summer vegetation which suggests a positive feedback of vegetation on itself. Nitrogen load had a positive effect on turbidity in both seasons, which was comparable in strength to the effect of vegetation on turbidity. To assess whether the effect of vegetation was primarily caused by sediment stabilization or a reduction of phytoplankton, we also tested models where turbidity was replaced by phytoplankton fluorescence or sediment-driven turbidity. The best-fitting regional-scale models suggested that high sediment-driven turbidity in spring reduces vegetation cover in summer, which in turn has a negative effect on sediment-driven turbidity in summer, indicating a potential positive feedback of sediment-driven turbidity on itself. Using data at the local scale, few relationships were significant, likely due to the influence of unmeasured variables and/or spatial heterogeneity. In summary, causal modeling based on data from a large-scale field survey suggested that aquatic vegetation can reduce turbidity at regional scales, and that high vegetation cover vs. high sediment-driven turbidity may represent two self-enhancing, alternative states of shallow bay ecosystems.

Despite this, research on the long-term pattern and dynamics of acidification in rivers affected by acid sulphate soils is scarce. This study examined changes in alkalinity and pH value during the period 1913-2007 in nine large Finnish rivers discharging into the Gulf of Bothnia. In addition, patterns of CODMn and colour were analysed during the period 1961-2007. Relationships between pH, alkalinity. CODMn and colour and climate variables were also studied. In four rivers with no AS soil impact (Kokemaenjoki, Kemijoki, Iijoki and Oulujoki), critically low pH levels did not occur during the study period, whereas three rivers exposed to minor or moderate levels of runoff from AS soils (Lestijoki, Kalajoki, and Siikajoki) had all periods with critically low pH and alkalinity. The most severe acidity problems occurred in the rivers Kyronjoki and Lapuanjoki, with extensive drainage of AS soils being the main reason for the low pH status. Maximum discharge was clearly related to the acidity status of many rivers during the autumn-winter runoff period, when a significant negative linear correlation was found between maximum discharge and minimum pH in the rivers affected by AS soils. There was also a more distinct relationship between maximum chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and minimum pH in autumn runoff than in spring. CODMn levels significantly increased with increasing discharge in the rivers with no or minor AS soil impact. Climate change is predicted to increase river flow in general and winter discharge in particular, and therefore the acidity problems in affected rivers may increase in a future climate.

The quantitative analysis of the experimental results indicates a general increasing trend and considerable variance in nitrates content, as well as a gradual decrease in pH, indicating that the lake's acidity is increasing, but only within the basicity range, with real values approaching neutrality: TDS and EC content suggest a very favorable situation, but when the overall parameters are tested, they show a defect. Since the sampling sites were well aerated, the dissolved oxygen content showed a growing pattern, and as a result, this metric proved to be useless in deciding the overall scenario in the lake. In the winter, the longitudinal trend line indicates a 10% decrease in pH, while in the summer, it shows a 4.4 percent decrease in pH. In winters, the longitudinal trend line reveals a 6.7 percent growth in nitrate content, while summers see a marginal decline. In the winter, the longitudinal trend line shows a 7% rise in dissolved oxygen, while in the summer, it shows a uniform trend.

Diet niches of major forage fish in Lake Michigan	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2005	Advances in Limnology				9th International Symposium on Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	JUL 21-AUG 27, 2005	Olsztyn, POLAND					A large complex of coregonine species historically dominated the fish community of Lake Michigan. The current species complex is simplified with one remaining coregonine, bloater (Coregonus hoyi), deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsoni), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), and two dominant invaders, alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). To better understand the diet relationships of the major offshore forage fishes now in Lake Michigan, diets of bloater, alewife, rainbow smelt, deepwater sculpin, and slimy sculpin were compared. The three sites, chosen to represent northern, central, and southern components of the lake, were sampled during spring, summer, and fall in 1994, and spring and fall in 1995. Forage fishes had diverse and variable diets, with niches differentiated by prey type or location. Diporeia hoyi, Mysis relicta, and zooplankton were the major diet items. The index of relative importance showed benthic (slimy and deepwater sculpins) and pelagic (alewife, rainbow smelt) feeding strategies with opportunistic bloaters incorporating both feeding strategies. Highest diet overlaps were between species of sculpin, and between large and small bloaters; both groups partitioned food by size. Though competition for food may be minimized by spatial segregation of potential competitors, the forage fish in Lake Michigan apparently partition food resources. Fishery management models incorporating food habits of pelagic forage fish would need to take into account diet variation associated with location and season.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47062-4				2007	60						261	+																WOS:000249090200021
J	Ke, ZX; Xie, P; Guo, LG				Ke, Zhixin; Xie, Ping; Guo, Longgen			Controlling factors of spring-summer phytoplankton succession in Lake Taihu (Meiliang Bay, China)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The spring-summer successions of phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton were examined weekly in Meiliang Bay of the subtropical Lake Taihu in 2004 and 2005. During the study period, the ecosystem of Meiliang Bay was characterized by (i) clearly declined nitrogen compounds (nitrate, TN, and ammonium) and slowly increased phosphorus compounds (TP and SRP), (ii) increased total phytoplankton density and rapid replacement of chlorophyta (mainly Ulothrix) by cyanobacteria (mainly Microcystis), and (iii) rapid replacement of large-sized crustaceans (Daphnia and Moina) by small-sized ones (Bosmina, Limnoithona, and Ceriodaphnia). Results from the CCA and correlation analysis indicate that the spring-summer phytoplankton succession was primarily controlled by abiotic factors. Cyanobacteria were mainly promoted by increased temperature and decreased concentrations of nitrogen compounds. The pure contribution of crustacean was low for the variation of phytoplankton suggesting a weak top-down control by crustacean zooplankton in the subtropical Lake Taihu.					ke, zhixin/O-7826-2014; Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020														0018-8158					JUL	2008	607						41	49		10.1007/s10750-008-9365-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9365-5													WOS:000256080700005
J	Rautio, M; Mariash, H; Forsström, L				Rautio, Milla; Mariash, Heather; Forsstrom, Laura			Seasonal shifts between autochthonous and allochthonous carbon contributions to zooplankton diets in a subarctic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We addressed the extent to which autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources contribute to zooplankton diet throughout the year in oligotrophic subarctic Lake Saanajarvi. Optical measures of dissolved organic matter (DOM) indicated high water discharge and associated terrestrial DOM during winter and low inputs in summer. Bulk particulate organic matter (POM) showed delta C-13 values consistent with allochthonous inputs of DOM. The most positive POM delta C-13 values (-227%) occurred during winter, when heterotrophic bacteria and nanoflagellates peaked in abundance; the isotopically lighter autotrophic phytoplankton shifted the POM delta C-13 to -29% in summer. The delta C-13 values of zooplankton were up to 4 parts per thousand more negative than those of POM, most likely because detritus and other nonliving material with higher delta C-13 values comprised 45-90% of POM. The delta C-13 of the cladoceran Daphnia umbra mirrored the trend of POM delta C-13, indicating a dietary shift from heavy dependence on autochthonous carbon in summer to allochthonous or heterotrophic food in winter. The delta C-13 of the most abundant zooplankton in Lake Saanajarvi, Eudiaptomus graciloides and Cyclops abyssorum, remained low and constant in winter, suggestive of little or no food intake during the 8 months of winter. There are significant differences in the zooplankton utilization of nonphytoplankton carbon in different seasons and among species. Although autochthonous carbon seemed to be mainly responsible for the growth of zooplankton, the ability to utilize allochthonous carbon-fueled microorganisms explains the survival of Daphnia through winter in northern lakes.

Amphibians are a particularly vulnerable group to winter climate change because of the tight coupling between their body temperature and metabolic rate. Here, we used a mechanistic microclimate model coupled to an animal biophysics model to predict the spatially explicit effects of future climate change on the wintering energetics of a freeze-tolerant amphibian, the Wood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), across its distributional range in the eastern United States. Our below-the-snow microclimate simulations were driven by dynamically downscaled climate projections from a regional climate model coupled to a one-dimensional model of the Laurentian Great Lakes. We found that warming soil temperatures and decreasing winter length have opposing effects on Wood Frog winter energy requirements, leading to geographically heterogeneous implications for Wood Frogs. While energy expenditures and peak body ice content were predicted to decline in Wood Frogs across most of our study region, we identified an area of heightened energetic risk in the northwestern part of the Great Lakes region where energy requirements were predicted to increase. Because Wood Frogs rely on body stores acquired in fall to fuel winter survival and spring breeding, increased winter energy requirements have the potential to impact local survival and reproduction. Given the geographically variable and intertwined drivers of future under-snow conditions (e.g., declining snow depths, rising air temperatures, shortening winters), spatially explicit assessments of species energetics and risk will be important to understanding the vulnerability of subnivium-adapted species.

The zooplankton was dominated by rotifers in spring and by crustaceans (cladocerans and copepods) in summer and autumn. A temperature gradient developed during summer and a drastic depletion of oxygen and increase in ammonia concentrations was observed below 7 m depth. The water quality of the River Warche was compared upstream and downstream of the lake using bioindication by rotifers and by reproduction ecotoxicological tests on Brachionus calyciflorus on the other hand. The bioindicators reveal an overall improvement in water quality of the Warche downstream of the reservoir, whereas the toxicity assays show a decline in water quality downstream of the lake during the stratification period, due to the release of hypolimnetic water from the dam. So, under special conditions, ecotoxicity assays appear to be more sensitive than bioindication using rotifers saprobic valences.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	387						459	467		10.1023/A:1017024730052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017024730052													WOS:000080234300061

Correspondences between key measured parameters allow a reconstruction of variations in lake level, evaporation intensity (summer droughts) and humidity (triggering erosion in winter and spring). They also indicate, occasionally, seasonal contrasts (e. g. phases with high winter rainfall). The Tecer sequence is divided into two main periods: (a) the mid-Holocene transition (from sixth to third millennia BP) characterised by the alternation of multicentenial wet and dry phases, and (b) shorter alternations during the last two millennia. During the mid-Holocene transition, intense droughts occur at the end of the sixth, fifth and fourth millennia BP. The characteristics of some climatic phases at Tecer seem specific to the location of the sequence which, when compared with other sites in the eastern Mediterranean, may record variations in the extent of different climatic systems (NE Atlantic, polar, east Mediterranean, Indian monsoon).

Despite investigations in the 1970s, protist diversity and biogeographic characteristics in the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood. Within the framework of a regional survey of protist diversity, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to investigate the compo-sition and spatiotemporal turnover of protist communities along the Yarlung Zangbo River, a representative aquatic habitat of the Tibetan Plateau. In total, we detected 9,959 amplicon sequence variants in protist com-munities along the river and associated lakes and wetlands. The alpha diversity of protists was highest in spring and declined in the autumn. Moreover, alpha diversity was much higher in the middle and upstream reaches and tributaries than in the connected lakes and wetlands. We discovered spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the composition of protist communities across the seasons. Bacillariophyta predominated in protist communities in cold seasons (spring and autumn) and colder (high-altitude) areas, whereas Ciliophora and Cercozoa species predominated in the warm season (summer) and warmer (low-altitude) areas. Of the environmental factors, altitude, turbidity and salinity correlated with spatiotemporal dissimilarities among protist communities. The breadth of the habitat niche was restricted by turbidity and altitude in river areas and by salinity in lake and wetland areas. Co-occurrence network analysis suggested that protist communities in the Yarlung Zangbo River were substantially more complex in the warm season than in the cold seasons, and that amplicon sequence variants belonging to Ochrophyta, Chlorophyta, and Ciliophora contributed greatly to the stability of the co -occurrence network. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal dy-namics of protist diversity in the Yarlung Zangbo River and improves our understanding of the environmental adaptation of protists living in aquatic habitats of the Tibetan Plateau.					an, ruizhi/ABC-3641-2021; zhang, peng/JOL-0040-2023; An, Ruizhi/ABC-3641-2021	Ba, Sang/0000-0002-7927-8034; An, Ruizhi/0000-0002-3297-4526														2772-7351				NOV	2022	1	4							100064	10.1016/j.watbs.2022.100064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watbs.2022.100064													WOS:001129841500001

We compared their diet seasonally in natural and artificial habitats and contrasted it with the food supply. The composition of the macroinvertebrate community was determined mainly by seasonal changes, whereas habitat type had smaller effect. Round gobies followed these changes flexibly. They consumed mainly chironomids in the spring, whilst amphipods and molluscs in the summer and autumn. Bighead gobies relied on amphipods in each season and in both habitats, and consumed fish, too, including round goby (intraguild predation). Diet overlap was determined by the morphological differences of the species allowing a varying degree of differentiation according to the seasonally changing food supply.

J	Solar, J; Pitonáková, T; Pogányová, A				Solar, Jaroslav; Pitonakova, Tatiana; Poganyova, Andrea			Changes in physicochemical parameters of the alpine/mountain stream influenced by summer flash flood in Tatra Mountains (Western Carpathians)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Changes to the physicochemical parameters of water in alpine/mountain streams can provide evidence of ongoing natural and anthropogenic processes in their catchment. In this study, we analysed a mountain stream (Javorinka) on the north-eastern side of the Tatra Mountains (Western Carpathians), which is minimally influenced by human activity. The stream was monitored weekly for 5 years (2017-2021) and evaluated for its seasonal variations in physicochemical parameters. These seasonal variations were influenced by the large summer flash flood in July 2018. We hypothesise that floods are essential for the oligotrophic profile of alpine/mountain streams. To support this idea, our main objective was to compare the seasonal trends of the main physicochemical parameters in the stream before and after floods or periods of high flow. We found evidence to support our hypothesis. For example, there was a significant decrease in the chemical consumption of oxygen and ammonia, and, conversely, an increase in the ratio of saturated oxygen and nitrate concentrations. Stream bed erosion also resulted in increased phosphates (over the next 2 years) and high enrichment of the water by dissolved solids in the spring. Interestingly outside of the main objectives, we observed a significant decrease in sulphates, especially in the summer and autumn of 2020 and 2021, which may be related to suppressed emissions due to the restriction of the COVID-19 lockdown. The observed trends and their changes therefore support the idea that alpine/mountain streams are excellent indicators of ongoing environmental processes, and that occasional summer flash floods support the oligotrophic profile of the stream system.					pogányová, andrea/JMB-1490-2023; Pitonakova, Tatiana/KHZ-7018-2024; Solár, Jaroslav/ABC-6930-2020	Pitonakova, Tatiana/0000-0002-9275-3338; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2024	196	7							655	10.1007/s10661-024-12835-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12835-4								38913150					WOS:001253517700001
J	WARREN, GJ				WARREN, GJ			PREDATION BY LIMNOCALANUS AS A POTENTIALLY MAJOR SOURCE OF WINTER NAUPLIAR MORTALITY IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Predation by adult L. macrurus may have a significant impact on naupliar mortality in Lake Michigan. Naupliar mortality rates were estimated from plankton samples from winter and early spring of 1981, and compared with estimates of potential mortality due to predation by adult Limnocalanus. Naupliar mortality rates ranged from 0.028-0.149/day. Predation by Limnocalanus could have accounted for between 3 and 100% of the naupliar mortality. These percentages were highest in winter and decreased with declining Limnocalanus densities in spring. Naupliar mortality rates increased from Jan. through April, during the time of the spring bloom in the lake. Predation, rather than competition for food, is probably, the main influence on naupliar mortality rates.																			0380-1330						1983	9	3					389	395		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71910-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71910-6													WOS:A1983RE99400007

The recent successful establishment of Neogobius melanostomus in the Baltic Sea posed questions whether this invader found its own trophic niche, to what extent it competes with native benthivores, and if commercially important fish could be affected. In this study conducted along the Lithuanian Baltic coast, we used the stable isotope approach to identify potential trophic competitors of N. melanostomus. We also employed gut content analysis to quantify the incorporation of N. melanostomus into the diet of native piscivores. Furthermore, pre-invasion gut content data enabled us to check if there were any changes in the piscivorous fish diet after the invasion. We found N. melanostomus to be a subdominant benthivorous fish during the warm season of 2012-2013. It occupied a higher trophic position in spring (3.9) than in autumn (2.9), but spring specimens were also larger. The invader exploited a narrow (standard ellipse area 0.3-0.5 parts per thousand(2)) and distinct core isotopic niche, but total niche area overlaps indicated potential trophic competition with Pleuronectes platessa, Planchthys flesus, Pomatoschistus minutus and Gasterosteus aculeatus in spring, and with P. minutus in autumn. The invader dominated the warm season (spring-autumn) diet of piscivorous fish (Gadus morhua, Myoxocephalus scorpius, Perca fluviatilis Scophthalmus maximus) and its invasion was generally associated with decreased crustacean and increased fish-prey content. Therefore, it is plausible that N. melanostomus has created novel trophic links within the food web. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, XL; Xu, LG; Wan, RR				Wang, Xiaolong; Xu, Ligang; Wan, Rongrong			Comparison on soil organic carbon within two typical wetland areas along the vegetation gradient of Poyang Lake, China	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Poyang Lake is an important wetland with international significance in biodiversity conservation and local carbon cycle. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of vegetation communities on seasonal and spatial variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in two dominant wetlands (dish-shaped pit wetland and delta wetland) of Poyang Lake, China. Results revealed significant variations of SOC and DOC along the vegetation gradient. Maximum accumulation of SOC and DOC was produced in Phragmites community, and the minimum ones in Phalaris community both in spring and in autumn. In comparison with delta wetland, dish-shaped pit wetland obtained higher SOC within the same vegetation type, which indicated that soils of dish-shaped pit wetland had greater capacity to store carbon. Compared with SOC, DOC represented stronger seasonal variations with great increase in autumn, which suggested that DOC was more sensitive to hydrology processing. Furthermore, significant variations of SOC and DOC were closely related to vegetation biomass both in spring and in autumn. Moreover, elevation and gradient also affected the distributing pattern of organic carbon suggesting significant influence of topography characteristics on the carbon pool.																			1998-9563	2224-7955				DEC	2016	47			1			261	277		10.2166/nh.2016.218	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.218													WOS:000391003300019

In this study, 14 antibiotics were systematically surveyed in a complex agricultural area in Central China. Re-sults indicated that the selected antibiotic concentrations in surface waters were higher in winter (average: 32.7 ng/L) than in summer (average: 17.9 ng/L), while the seasonal variation in groundwaters showed an opposite trend (2.2 ng/L in dry winter vs. 8.0 ng/L in summer). Macrolides were the predominant antibiotics in this area, with a detected frequency of over 90%. A significant correlation between surface water and groundwater antibiotics was only observed in winter ( R 2 = 0.58). This study further confirmed the impact of land uses on these contaminants, with optimal buffer radii of 2500 m in winter and 500 m in summer. Risk assessment indicated that clarithromycin posed high risks in this area. Overall, this study identified the spatiotemporal variability of antibiotics in a typical agricultural area in Central China and revealed the impact of land uses on antibiotic pollution in aquatic environments.

However, information on the succession of these sulfur bacteria in seasonally stratified lakes using molecular biological techniques is scarce. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of sulfur bacteria during oxic-anoxic regime shifts in Lake Vechten. Oxygen and sulfate were mixed throughout the water column in winter and early spring. Meanwhile, SRB, green sulfur bacteria (GSB), purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), and colorless sulfur bacteria (CSB) exclusively inhabited the sediment. After the water column stratified, oxygen and nitrate concentrations decreased in the hypolimnion and various SRB species expanded into the anoxic hypolimnion. Consequently, sulfate was reduced to sulfide, stimulating the growth of PSB and GSB in the metalimnion and hypolimnion during summer stratification. When hypoxia spread throughout the water column during fall turnover, SRB and GSB vanished from the water column, whereas CSB (mainly Arcobacter) and PSB (Lamprocystis) became dominant and oxidized the accumulated sulfide under micro-aerobic conditions. Our results support the view that, once ecosystems have become anoxic and sulfidic, a large oxygen influx is needed to overcome the anaerobic sulfur cycle and bring the ecosystems back into their oxic state.

Seasonal variation in the function and diversity of methanotrophs in the littoral wetland of a boreal eutrophic lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Littoral wetlands are responsible for most of the total methane (CH4) emissions from lake ecosystems. We show that seasonally variable hydrological and temperature conditions in the littoral wetland of a eutrophic boreal lake affect the community composition and gene transcription of methanotrophs measured by a particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene-targeted microarray. Type Ib freshwater-cluster methanotrophs were favoured by the high water level, and CH4 oxidation was positively correlated with their pmoA gene transcripts. In the dry subsite of the wetland, the more stagnant hydrological conditions in summer and autumn induced the dominance of type II methanotrophs over type I methanotrophs (community composition and pmoA gene transcripts). The relative abundance of type II methanotrophs increased in winter. The results provide new insight into the variation of methanotroph communities across seasons in littoral wetlands.					; Bodrossy, Levente/B-8054-2009	Siljanen, Henri/0000-0002-3197-1438; Bodrossy, Levente/0000-0001-6940-452X													0168-6496	1574-6941				JUN	2012	80	3					548	555		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01321.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01321.x								22296339					WOS:000303761900003

Determination of the Optimal Level of Water Releases from a Reservoir to Control Water Quality	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE												The increase of pollution loads and of the diversity of pollutants threatening water resources calls for sophisticated management of water resources. This paper shows that the thermal stratification of water in reservoirs and the variation of its density with reservoir depth make it possible to manage sudden water-pollution events by controlling water release as a function of lake depth to minimize effects associated with the release of polluted water from reservoirs. The best outlet level of a reservoir to release polluted water is selected in this paper using the technique for order performance by similarity of ideal solution (TOPSIS). The latter is a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) tool for managing water quality in reservoirs. The application of MCDM is illustrated with the management of reservoir releases to cope with the sudden spill of 30 m(3) of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) into the Amirkabir reservoir (Iran). The CE-QUAL-W2 calibrated model is used to simulate the spreading of MTBE in the reservoir. Pollutant spreading is predicted under four seasonal pollution scenarios and one scenario considering all seasons simultaneously. This allows for the consideration of the effects of climatic and water demand conditions on reservoir water quality. This paper's results show that the water should be released from the low-elevation gate in spring and winter and from the high-elevation gate in summer and autumn to optimally manage the sudden release of MTBE spills in the Amirkabir reservoir.

Meltwater in buried lakes (BLs) can even persist through the winter, disturbing the englacial thermal regime and providing an important buffer against GrIS's contribution to sea-level rise. However, little is known about the inter-annual BL dynamics in the GrIS, and there is no quantitative statistic about the overall buried percentage. Here, we conduct a satellite-based study to automatically map the winter BLs over the GrIS during 2017-2022 using multi-source optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. To eliminate the interferences from other weak microwave reflecting surfaces, summer SLs are first extracted from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images to determine the potential BL searching areas on winter Sentinel-1 images. A self-adaptive thresholding algorithm is proposed to extract BLs within the dilated summer SLs using histogram-based morphological edge detectors. BLs extracted by the proposed method and visual interpretation show a substantial agreement with a precision of 0.82 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. On average, a total buried lake area of 182.27 km2 was observed each winter during the period 2017-2022. BLs were mainly distributed in the Center-West, South-West and North-East Basins, with the majority occurring at elevations between 800 and 1700 m. In 2019-2020, a sudden extension of BLs was observed over the GrIS, especially in the North-East Basin where abnormally high temperatures and surface runoff were recorded. In 2021-2022, a widespread distribution of BLs in the South-West Basin was observed after abnormal snowfall. Overall, about 13% of the GrIS summer SLs can persist through winter, suggesting the potential for meltwater hydrofracture in winter over large areas.

Based on short-term spatial observations in the spring, summer, and winter and on long-term site-specific observation from 1988 to 2013, the spatial, seasonal, long-term variations, and the factors affecting transparency are presented for Xin'anjiang Reservoir (China). Spatially, transparency was high in the open water but low in the bays and the inflowing river mouths, reflecting the effect of river runoff. The seasonal effects were distinct, with lower values in the summer than in the winter, most likely due to river runoff and phytoplankton biomass increases. The transparency decreased significantly with a linear slope of 0.079 m/year, indicating a 2.05 m decrease and a marked decrease in water quality. A marked increase occurred in chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration, and a significant correlation was found between the transparency and Chla concentration, indicating that phytoplankton biomass can partially explain the long-term trend of transparency in Xin'anjiang Reservoir. The river input and phytoplankton biomass increase were associated with soil erosion and nutrient loss in the catchment. Our study will support future management of water quality in Xin'anjiang Reservoir.

Upon climate warming and permafrost thaw, the behavior of Se in northern peatlands becomes an issue of major concern, because a sizable amount of Se can be emitted to the atmosphere from thawing soils and inland water surfaces and exported to downstream waters, thus impacting the Arctic biota. Working toward providing a first-order assessment of spatial and temporal variation of Se concentration in thermokarst waters of the largest frozen peatland in the world, we sampled thaw lakes and rivers across a 750-km latitudinal profile. This profile covered sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost regions of western Siberia Lowland (WSL), where we measured dissolved (<0.45 mu m) Se concentration during spring (June), summer (August), and autumn (September). We found maximum Se concentration in the discontinuous permafrost zone. Considering all sampled lakes, Se exhibited linear relationship (R-2 = 0.7 to 0.9, p < 0.05, n approximate to 70) with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration during summer and autumn. Across the permafrost gradient, the lakes in discontinuous permafrost regions demonstrated stronger relationship with DOC and UV-absorbance compared to lakes in sporadic/isolated and continuous permafrost zones. Both seasonal and spatial features of Se distribution in thermokarst lakes and ponds suggest that Se is mainly released during thawing of frozen peat. Mobilization and immobilization of Se within peat-lake-river watersheds likely occurs as organic and organo-Fe, Al colloids, probably associated with reduced and elemental Se forms. The increase of active layer thickness may enhance leaching of Se in the form of organic complexes with aromatic carbon from the deep horizons of the peat profile. Further, the northward shift of permafrost boundaries in WSL may sizably increase Se concentration in lakes of continuous permafrost zone.					; Bueno, Maria/C-3684-2013; Manasypov, Rinat/S-2135-2016; David, Amouroux/HSE-7664-2023; Pokrovsky, Oleg/W-4934-2019	Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069; Manasypov, Rinat/0000-0001-5191-2817; Bueno, Maite/0000-0002-4676-5311; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 18	2018	52	18					10254	10262		10.1021/acs.est.8b00918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b00918								30148609					WOS:000445441000006

Establishing Winter Origins of Migrating Lesser Snow Geese Using Stable Isotopes	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Increases in Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens) populations and large-scale habitat changes in North America have contributed to the concentration of migratory waterfowl on fewer wetlands, reducing resource availability, and enhancing risks of disease transmission. Predicting wintering locations of migratory individuals is critical to guide wildlife population management and habitat restoration. We used stable carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and hydrogen (delta H-2) isotope ratios in muscle tissue of wintering Snow Geese to discriminate four major wintering areas, the Playa Lake Region, Texas Gulf Coast, Louisiana Gulf Coast, and Arkansas, and infer the wintering locations of individuals collected later during the 2007 and 2008 spring migrations in the Rainwater Basin (RWB) of Nebraska. We predicted the wintering ground derivation of migrating Snow Geese using a likelihood-based approach. Our three-isotope analysis provided an efficient discrimination of the four wintering areas. The assignment model predicted that 53% [95% CI: 37-69] of our sample of Snow Geese from the RWB in 2007 had most likely originated in Louisiana, 38% [23-54] had wintered on Texas Gulf Coast, and 9% [0-20] in Arkansas; the assessment suggested that 89% [73-100] of our 2008 sample had most likely come from Texas Gulf Coast, 9% [0-27] from Louisiana Gulf Coast, and 2% [0-9] from Arkansas. Further segregation of wintering grounds and additional sampling of spring migrating Snow Geese would refine overall assignment and help explain interannual variations in migratory connectivity. The ability to distinguish origins of northbound geese can support the development of spatially-adaptive management strategies for the midcontinent Snow Goose population. Establishing migratory connectivity using isotope assignment techniques can be extended to other waterfowl species to determine critical habitat, evaluate population energy requirements, and inform waterfowl conservation and management strategies.

Wild Apple Growth and Climate Change in Southeast Kazakhstan	FORESTS												Wild populations of Malus sieversii [Ldb.] M. Roem are valued genetic and watershed resources in Inner Eurasia. These populations are located in a region that has experienced rapid and on-going climatic change over the past several decades. We assess relationships between climate variables and wild apple radial growth with dendroclimatological techniques to understand the potential of a changing climate to influence apple radial growth. Ring-width chronologies spanning 48 to 129 years were developed from 12 plots in the Trans-Ili Alatau and Jungar Alatau ranges of Tian Shan Mountains, southeastern Kazakhstan. Cluster analysis of the plot-level chronologies suggests different temporal patterns of growth variability over the last century in the two mountain ranges studied. Changes in the periodicity of annual ring-width variability occurred ca. 1970 at both mountain ranges, with decadal-scale variability supplanted by quasi-biennial variation. Seascorr correlation analysis of primary and secondary weather variables identified negative growth associations with spring precipitation and positive associations with cooler fall-winter temperatures, but the relative importance of these relationships varied spatially and temporally, with a shift in the relative importance of spring precipitation ca. 1970 at Trans-Ili Alatau. Altered apple tree radial growth patterns correspond to altered climatology in the Lake Balkhash Basin driven by unprecedented intensified Arctic Oscillations after the late 1970s.					; Panyushkina, Irina/AAG-6228-2020	Muhamadiev, Nurzan/0000-0003-3199-2447; Panyushkina, Irina/0000-0001-8854-2637														1999-4907				NOV	2017	8	11							406	10.3390/f8110406	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f8110406													WOS:000416795600002
J	Andersson, E; Kumblad, L				Andersson, E; Kumblad, L			A carbon budget for an oligotrophic clearwater lake in mid-Sweden	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In this study, a whole-lake carbon budget for the oligotrophic, clearwater Lake Eckarfjarden was established both on an annual and seasonal basis. For budget calculations, the lake was divided into three habitats (pelagial, littoral and benthic) and the biota into 19 functional groups. In the lake, major parts of biomass (97%) and primary production (91%) are concentrated in benthic and littoral habitats and to a few functional groups. Respiration on the other hand, is focused on benthic and pelagial habitats where 60% and 39%, respectively, of the respiration took place. Our conceptual model indicates strong interactions between habitats. For instance, the pelagial is fed with carbon fixed by primary producers in the benthic and littoral zones. On an annual basis, total primary production exceeds total respiration and the lake is net autotrophic. However, there are clear differences between habitats and between seasons. For instance, the littoral is net autotrophic during spring, summer and autumn, the benthic habitat is net autotrophic only during summer, and the pelagial is always net heterotrophic. Our results demonstrate clear couplings between habitats and organisms and the importance of a holistic view when studying lake ecosystems.

The aim of this investigation was to determine which factors: allo- or autochthonous could influence phytoplankton variability. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used to determine which of these parameters had the greatest impact on phytoplankton biomass. Results showed that there was an influence of allochthonous factors on the phytoplankton during spring and summer and showed significant correlation with air temperature, water temperature and nitrate-nitrogen. Nitrate-nitrogen was a major component of the river, which supplied the reservoir. Autochthonous factor influenced the phytoplankton assemblage during late summer/autumn (when the water column was stable). In particular, the phytoplankton was influenced by the ammonium-nitrogen correlation. NH4-N was the form of nitrogen delivered from the sediments when the water column was mixed. We confirmed that the phytoplankton assemblages of the Dobczyce reservoir were "controlled" by variability of physical factors compared to natural lakes.

J	Isard, SA; Angel, JR; VanDyke, GT				Isard, SA; Angel, JR; VanDyke, GT			Zones of origin for Great Lakes cyclones in North America, 1899-1996	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The zones of origin for all cyclones that traversed the Great Lakes region from 1899 to 1996 are analyzed using a digital daily record of central pressure and location for individual cyclones. Plots of latitude of formation show that Great Lakes cyclones form (or reform) east of the Rocky Mountains at all latitudes between 25 degrees and 65 degrees N. In winter, about the same number of cyclones originate to the northwest as to the southwest of the Great Lakes region. In spring, the southwest zone is dominant. The number of summertime cyclones is greatly reduced, with the west zone of origin most active, while the fall plot displays a transition between the summer and winter distributions. The proportion of strong Great Lakes cyclones that originate in the southwest zone is greater than for all cyclones; however, the seasonal shifts in the latitudinal distributions of origin in the two datasets are similar. An analysis of differences in frequencies by zone of origin for Great Lakes cyclones during months characterized by positive and negative Pacific-North American (PNA) index patterns reveals a statistically significant relationship between the midtropospheric flow pattern and cyclogenesis. The results indicate that the number of cyclones per month for the positive (PNA index > 0.5) and negative (PNA index < -0.5) categories are approximately equal and that the combined frequencies for positive and negative PNA pattern categories for the northwest, west, and southwest zones of origin are similar. The study supports the intuitive assertion that more Great Lakes cyclones originate from the northwest during months characterized by positive PNA index values than the negative pattern while more cyclones from the west and southwest are associated with the negative PNA index pattern than the positive one. Approximately 20% of the cyclones that traversed the Great Lakes from 1899 to 1996 originated in the region. The most noteworthy and puzzling finding of the study is that cyclogenesis over the lakes as a proportion of cyclone presence in the region is highest in the summer months. This result corresponds with the finding that cyclones traversing the Great Lakes region in May-July accelerate as they approach the region and increase their rates of deepening over the lakes.

J	Sand-Jensen, K; Pedersen, NL				Sand-Jensen, K; Pedersen, NL			Differences in temperature, organic carbon and oxygen consumption among lowland streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Temperature, organic carbon and oxygen consumption were measured over a year at 13 sites in four lowlands streams within the same region in North Zealand, Denmark with the objectives of determining: (i) spatial and seasonal differences between open streams, forest streams and streams with or without lakes, (ii) factors influencing the temperature dependence of oxygen consumption rate, (iii) consequences of higher temperature and organic content in lake outlets on oxygen consumption rate, and (iv) possible consequences of forecasted global warming on degradation of organic matter. 2. High concentrations of easily degradable dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were found in open streams downstream of plankton-rich lakes, while high concentrations of recalcitrant DOC were found in a forest brook draining a forest swamp. Concentrations of predominantly recalcitrant POC and DOC were low in a groundwater-fed forest spring. Overall, DOC concentration was two to 18 times higher than POC concentrations. 3. Oxygen consumption rate at 20 degrees C was higher during summer than winter, higher in open than shaded streams and higher in lake outlets than inlets. Rate was closely related to concentrations of chlorophyll and POC but not to DOC. The ratio of oxygen consumption rate to total organic concentrations (DOC + POC), serving as a measure of organic degradability, was highest downstream of lakes, intermediate in open streams and lowest in forest streams. 4. Temperature coefficients describing the exponential increase of oxygen consumption rate between 4 and 20 degrees C averaged 0.121 degrees C-1 (Q(10) of 3.35) in 70 measurements and showed no significant variations between seasons and stream sites or correlations with ambient temperature and organic content. 5. Oxygen consumption rate was enhanced downstream of lakes during summer because of higher temperature and, more significantly, greater concentrations of degradable organic carbon. Oxygen consumption rates were up to seven times higher in the stream with three impoundments than in a neighbouring unshaded stream and 21 times higher than in the groundwater-fed forest spring. 6. A regional climate model has calculated a dramatic 4-5 degrees C rise in air temperature over Denmark by 2070-2100. If this is realised, unshaded streams are estimated to become 2-3 degrees C warmer in summer and winter and 5-7 degrees C warmer in spring and, thereby, increase oxygen consumption rates at ambient temperature by 30-40% and 80-130%, respectively. Faster consumption of organic matter and dissolved oxygen downstream of point sources should increase the likelihood of oxygen stress of the stream biota and lead to the export of less organic matter but more mineralised nutrients to the coastal waters.

We assessed the effectiveness of estuarine artificial reefs as a fisheries enhancement initiative; described the diversity and abundance of species associated with them, and detailed the patterns of colonization and community development associated with an artificial reef deployment in Lake Macquarie, a large coastal barrier lagoon on the southeast coast of Australia. Six artificial reefs (one artificial reef group), constructed from artificial reef units (Reef Balls (R)), were deployed in December 2005 and sampled six times per season over two years using baited remote underwater video (BRUV). Colonization of the artificial reef group was relatively rapid with the majority of species identified over the two-year study period observed within the first year post-deployment. Overall, 27 species from 17 families were identified. Key colonising species included Pelates sexlineatus (Terapontidae), Acanthopagrus australis (Sparidae), Pagrus auratus (Sparidae) and Rhabdosargus sarba (Sparidae). Species richness showed evidence of potential seasonal fluctuations, being higher in warm water months (Summer/Autumn), and lower in the colder water months (Winter/Spring), while species diversity increased significantly with reef age. Fish assemblage composition remained relatively stable after the first year of sampling, with few discernible patterns in assemblage structure evident after the first year. Distinct separation in reef age groupings was evident during the second year of sampling; a pattern primarily driven by a decrease in abundance of P. sexlineatus, a result of the isolated nature of the artificial reefs and the interrelated effects of density dependence and predation.

The results from laboratory incubations of water samples were combined with chlorophyll a, extinction coefficient and insolation data using a computer model developed by Fee. The average annual daily production rates of carbon were: Lake Rotorua, 2.3 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 (range 0.70-5.5 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1); Lake Rerewhakaaitu, 2.2 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 (range 0.66-4.00 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1); and Lake Rotoiti, 1.1 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 (range 0.32-2.46 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1). The seasonal patterns of production differ for each lake. Lake Rotorua has maxima in summer or early autumn, Lake Rerewhakaaitu in autumn, and Lake Rotoiti in winter. In Lake Rotorua there was considerable variation from year to year in the timing and intensity of the maxima. The year-to-year differences between quaterly and between the annual production totals are small, considering the experimental errors involved in the study of large lakes.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1980	14	3					229	236		10.1080/00288330.1980.9515865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1980.9515865													WOS:A1980KS41400002

Yet the mechanisms controlling precipitation in the Arctic are poorly understood and quantified only by the short, sparse instrumental record. We use hydrogen isotope ratios (delta H-2) of lipid biomarkers in lake sediments from western Greenland to reconstruct precipitation seasonality and summer temperature during the past 8 kyr. Aquatic biomarker delta H-2 was 100 parts per thousand more negative from 6 to 4 ka than during the early and late Holocene, which we interpret to reflect increased winter snowfall. The middle Holocene also had high summer air temperature, decreased early winter sea ice in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea, and a strong, warm West Greenland Current. These results corroborate model predictions of winter snowfall increases caused by sea ice retreat and furthermore suggest that warm currents advecting more heat into the polar seas may enhance Arctic evaporation and snowfall.					briner, jason/JDM-4641-2023	Thomas, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6489-7123													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 28	2016	43	10					5302	5308		10.1002/2016GL068513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL068513													WOS:000378347500078

While this ability may be challenged in anthropogenically disturbed systems, such as temperate regulated reservoirs, where littoral freezing/drying may alter critical habitats, no work has yet been conducted to determine if fish within these systems are able to home to specific habitats. In addition, most studies have examined site fidelity over a limited time scale. In this study, we investigated the long-term movement and habitat utilization of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802) using a combination of radiotelemetry and habitat mapping across nine consecutive seasons in a winter drawdown reservoir to examine seasonal population- and individual-level spatial clustering and site fidelity. Largemouth bass navigated across large distances through spatially and temporally disturbed habitat with exceptional inter-annual site fidelity during winter, spring, and summer. Drawdown constrained the availability of preferred winter habitat, concentrated fish, and rendered them potentially vulnerable to overexploitation, predation, and competition. Adaptive drawdown protocols should be developed that incorporate temporally and spatially resolved fish movement data, and variables such as available critical habitat, which are essential for maintaining fish population stability in temperate regulated reservoirs.

Diel vertical migration hypotheses explain size-dependent behaviour in a freshwater piscivore	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												In aquatic organisms, diel vertical migration (DVM) is typically characterized as ascent at dusk and decent at dawn. Often several hypotheses are required to explain the sensory-mechanisms and ultimate causes of DVM. Currently, most of the research focused at the individual level has identified DVM functions as a response to light, feeding opportunities, predator avoidance and bioenergetics in small planktivores. However, there are no studies examining whether DVM hypotheses can explain and predict individual behavioural characteristics in top-level predators. In this study, we test whether bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, a cold-water pelagic-cruising piscivore, show size-dependent daily and seasonal patterns in DVM consistent with light levels (proximate trigger) and feeding opportunities, predator avoidance and bioenergetics hypotheses. To test these hypotheses, free-swimming bull trout (N = 187, 358-881 mm total length) in a large, temperate reservoir were implanted with depth-sensing acoustic transmitters for 1 year. We found that swimming depths of bull trout were shallowest at night, deepest during the day and showed clear patterns of DVM across all seasons. In line with the predator avoidance hypothesis, large and small bull trout occupied different depths in all seasons except the spring, while the likelihood of depth change for large and small fish varied depending on season and diel period. The greatest depth difference among large and small bull trout occurred in the summer and less so in autumn. In the summer, small bull trout remained at greater depths (similar to 15 m) than larger fish (similar to 7 m) regardless of diel period. Our results indicate that light is a proximate trigger, and since there is no clear temperature-related bioenergetic advantage to changing depths during winter, feeding opportunities and predator avoidance are the most parsimonious DVM hypotheses to explain body-size-dependent behaviour in this top-level predator.

J	MOORE, JW				MOORE, JW			EPIPELIC AND EPIPHYTIC ALGAL COMMUNITIES IN GREAT SLAVE LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Seasonal changes in the densities of epiphytic and epipelic algae were determined during 1975 and 1976 at 2 sites on the north shore of Great Slave Lake. The epiphyton waxed rapidly in May and reached maximum densities of 5-6 .times. 108 .mu.m3/cm2 in June. Although densities remained high during the summer, they fell rapidly in Oct., followed by a secondary peak in Nov. The main species were Tabellaria flocculosa, Achnanthes minutissima, A. linearis, Gomphonema intricatum and Lyngbya diguetii. The epipelon, consisting largely of Nitzschia palea, N. dissipata, Fragilaria construens and Oscillatoria spp., also showed spring and fall peaks in densities, with maximum populations of 4.2 .times. 108 .mu.m3/cm2 being recorded in June and July. The growing season for both communities was limited by the formation of ice in the fall, whereas the maximum standing crop of the flora was at least partially restricted by low nutrient levels (total P, 0.008 mg/l; total alkalinity, 30 mg/l). Seasonal changes in the density of epipelon were monitored during 1977 and 1978 at a 3rd site on the north shore of the lake, where total P and total alkalinity ranged up to 0.010 and 94 mg/l, respectively. Prevalent taxa included Cymatopleura elliptica, Epithemia turgida, Rhopalodia gibba, Cymbella spp. and Nostoc spp. The growth cycles of the flora were again characterized by spring and fall peaks in numbers. Algal densities were high (up to 2.3 .times. 109 .mu.m3/cm2), possibly a reflection of nutrient availability. Samples of epiphyton and epipelon were taken at an additional 7 sites in the east arm of the lake during June and July 1975. The main epiphytic species were Cocconeis placentula, Achnanthes minutissima and Tabellaria flocculosa, while prevalent epipelic taxa included Navicula graciloides, Fragilaria vaucheriae, T. flocculosa and A. minutissima. Densities were less than those recorded from the 3 sites on the north shore, again possibly a reflection of nutrient availability.																			0008-4026						1980	58	10					1165	1173		10.1139/b80-145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b80-145													WOS:A1980JW68000008

We studied the optical compositions and sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) in Lake Taihu, a large, shallow and eutrophic lake in China. Significant differences in optical compositions and sources occurred between the POM and DOM. The temporal-spatial distribution of the fluorescence indices suggested that the POM in Lake Taihu was mainly from autochthonous sources, but more exogenous characteristics were shown in POM in the river mouths compared with other regions. The chromophoric DOM in Lake Taihu mainly displayed autochthonous characteristics. The POM-DOM PARAFAC model was used to examine OM optical composition and five components were identified, which contained three protein-like components (C1, C2, and C5), a microbial humic-like component (C3), and a terrestrial humic-like component (C4). The POM was dominated by C5 in summer and autumn and C3 in winter and spring, and the DOM was dominated by protein-like components (C1, C2, and C5) through the entire year. The algae-dominated region had a relative higher contribution of tryptophan-like components of POM compared with the macrophyte-dominated region. A conceptual model based on the theory of four phases of cyanobacteria bloom development was proposed to fully describe the relationship between POM-DOM exchanges and cyanobacteria bloom development.

The results indicated warming and longer sunshine hours promoted Chla/TN and Chla/TP in winter months from 2005 to 2017, which may cause severer blooms in winter and spring. However, a more stable water column due to atmospheric stilling and water level elevation mainly led to the increasing Chla/TN and Chla/TP in remaining months from 2005 to 2017, allowing algae to grow better. The results also indicated that water stability promotes algal growth mainly due to improved light availability. As atmospheric stilling is an aspect of global climate changes, this study would affect future algal bloom mitigation efforts in shallow lakes worldwide. Algal blooms are environmental challenges confronting lakes worldwide and are significantly influenced by chlorophyll a yields per unit phosphorus (Chla/TP), or nitrogen (Chla/TN). Here, the influence of inter-annual hydrometeorological variations on Chla/TP and Chla/TN were evaluated in eutrophic shallow Lake Taihu, China. Our results demonstrated significant increases (p < 0.001) in both Chla/TN and Chla/TP from 2005 to 2017, and increased Chla yields during the winter months were mainly correlated with higher water temperature and longer sunshine hours, which may cause severer blooms in winter and spring. In remaining months from 2005 to 2017, typical associations between atmospheric stilling (or water level elevation) and higher Chla yields were observed. The results also indicate that atmospheric stilling and water level elevation significantly (p < 0.001) decreased background turbidity and promoted buoyant cyanobacterial biomass, alleviating phytoplankton light limitation. Given the subtropical location, eutrophic status, and high background turbidity of Lake Taihu, light may be the critical limiting factor for summer phytoplankton growth; thus, improved light availability would promote Chla yields until self-shading caused further light limitations. If the mechanism is general, promoting the effect of atmospheric stilling on annual peak Chla in shallow lakes may be greatly underestimated, and our finding will affect future bloom mitigation efforts in such systems.					; xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013	, Zou/0000-0001-9697-5168; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; 														2079-7737				DEC	2021	10	12							1222	10.3390/biology10121222	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology10121222								34943136					WOS:000735859500001

The weevil spends all summer on submersed plants, producing 3 to 6 generations. In September to November adult weevils move to shore where they overwinter in leaf litter at drier sites near the shoreline. Mean November shoreline densities from 1992-1998 at Lake Auburn (mean = 43 N/ m(2)) and Smith's Bay of Lake Minnetonka, (mean = 125 N/ m(2)) have ranged from zero to over 200 N/m(2). Overwinter mortality is not severe (survival was typically >60%). Adults collected from terrestrial habitat have developed flight muscles and limited flight has been observed in the spring but submersed adults in summer do not have developed flight muscles. Adults return to the water in spring and females begin to develop and lay eggs after the water temperature reaches 10-15C. Spring (May-June) and Fall (September) inlake densities in these two lakes have ranged from zero to 40 N/m(2) and Lake Auburn typically had higher in-lake weevil densities (mean of 15 N/m(2) compared to 4 N/m(2) at Smith's Bay). There was no relationship between in-lake and shoreline densities at Lake Auburn, but Smith's Bay spring in-lake densities were correlated with spring shoreline densities. Inlake densities were not correlated between the two lakes but shoreline densities were correlated over time, suggesting that regional climatic factors may influence shoreline densities. Weevils disappeared from Lake Auburn in-lake samples in July 1998; no weevils were found there in shoreline or in-lake samples in 1999. In-lake factors such as fish predation may be more limiting than overwinter conditions.

Results showed that the water quality in the study area was generally poor, and the main parameters exceeding standards (level V) were nitrogen and phosphorus. The observed average concentrations of the total nitrogen (TN) were 4.90 mg L-1 in autumn and 9.29 mg L-1 in winter, and those of the total phosphorus (TP) were 0.24 mg L-1 in autumn and 0.88 mg L-1 in winter, respectively. Thirty-seven species, 30 genera, and four phyla of phytoplankton were detected in the river. Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta were the dominant phyla in autumn, with average abundance and biomass of 221.5 x 10(4) cells L-1 and 4.41 mg L-1, respectively. The dominant population in winter was Bacillariophyta, and the average abundance and biomass were 153.4 x 10(4) cells L-1 and 6.58 mg L-1, respectively. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between environmental parameters and phytoplankton communities showed that Chlorophyta could tolerate the higher concentrations of the permanganate index, nitrogen, and phosphorus in eutrophic water; Bacillariophyta could adapt well to changing water environments; and the TN/TP ratio had obvious impacts on the distributions of Cyanophyta, Euglenophyta, and some species of Chlorophyta. CCA analyses for autumn and winter data revealed that the main environmental parameters influencing phytoplankton distribution were water temperature, conductivity, and total nitrogen, and the secondary factors were dissolved oxygen, NH4 (+)-N, NO3-N, TN, CODMn, TN/TP ratio, and oxidation-reduction potential.					; Gao, Yanzheng/G-6391-2010; Zhao, zhenhua/AAT-7422-2021; Yan, Wenming/AEL-1938-2022	Gao, Yanzheng/0000-0002-3814-3555; Zhao, zhenhua/0000-0003-2330-4288; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2013	20	7					5003	5012		10.1007/s11356-013-1464-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1464-9								23329129					WOS:000321126700061
J	GREENLAND, D				GREENLAND, D			EXTREME PRECIPITATION DURING 1921 IN THE AREA OF THE NIWOT RIDGE LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH SITE, FRONT RANGE, COLORADO, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												An unusually high amount of precipitation, including a world record 24-h snow-fall, was recorded in 1921 at Silver Lake, Colorado, near the Niwot Ridge alpine tundra Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. There was 68.3 in (1735 mm) total annual precipitation which was over five standard deviations above the 1914-1992 mean and the April snowfall produced 76 in (1.93 m) of snow in 24 h. An investigation of these phenomena brings to light the following points. The precipitation at Silver Lake, and presumably the Niwot Ridge LTER site, during 1921 was exceptionally high. The precipitation was highly localized. There are no obvious causes for the high precipitation to be found in the synoptic climatology for the year. However, moisture sources from the west in the winter and spring and from the south in the summer do seem to have been available. Despite well-marked, but temporary, impacts on humans and possibly other higher mammals, there is no evidence of any major or long-lasting impacts to the alpine tundra or subalpine forest ecosystems. Higher temperatures and persistent drought, as might be found with global climatic warming, are proposed as potentially more important disturbance factors to these systems.																			0004-0851					FEB	1995	27	1					19	28		10.2307/1552064	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552064													WOS:A1995QM39200003
J	Moldowan, PD; Tattersall, GJ; Rollinson, N				Moldowan, Patrick D.; Tattersall, Glenn J.; Rollinson, Njal			Climate-associated decline of body condition in a fossorial salamander	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Temperate ectotherms have responded to recent environmental change, likely due to the direct and indirect effects of temperature on key life cycle events. Yet, a substantial number of ectotherms are fossorial, spending the vast majority of their lives in subterranean microhabitats that are assumed to be buffered against environmental change. Here, we examine whether seasonal climatic conditions influence body condition (a measure of general health and vigor), reproductive output, and breeding phenology in a northern population of fossorial salamander (Spotted Salamander, Ambystoma maculatum). We found that breeding body condition declined over a 12-year monitoring period (2008-2019) with warmer summer and autumn temperatures at least partly responsible for the observed decline in body condition. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated metabolism drives the negative association between temperature and condition. Population-level reproduction, assessed via egg mass counts, showed high interannual variation and was weakly influenced by autumn temperatures. Salamander breeding phenology was strongly correlated with lake ice melt but showed no long-term temporal trend (1986-2019). Climatic warming in the region, which has been and is forecasted to be strongest in the summer and autumn, is predicted to lead to a 5%-27% decline in salamander body condition under realistic near-future climate scenarios. Although the subterranean environment offers a thermal buffer, the observed decline in condition and relatively strong effect of summer temperature on body condition suggest that fossorial salamanders are sensitive to the effects of a warming climate. Given the diversity of fossorial taxa, heightened attention to the vulnerability of subterranean microhabitat refugia and their inhabitants is warranted amid global climatic change.

J	Sealy, SG; Carter, HR				Sealy, SG; Carter, HR			Inland occurrences of dovekies in September in northeastern north America	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In some years, inland "wrecks" of Dovekies (Alle alle) have occurred in northeastern North America in November to February, with birds apparently driven inland by storms from wintering areas off eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. In the late 19(th) century, small numbers also were recorded inland in September in Maine (1869), Massachusetts (1872), Connecticut (1874), and Pennsylvania (1878). No inland occurrences in September were recorded for another 90 years until individuals were sighted in Quebec (1962 and 1963) and on Lake Ontario in upstate New York (1983). September birds arrived inland earlier in the year than when most individuals depart colonies in the High Arctic and move to wintering areas in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. However, the geographic pattern of September inland occurrences was similar to major late-fall and winter inland wrecks, suggesting a common source area. Dovekies reported inland in September likely originated from among the small numbers of subadults that summered off Newfoundland or subadults or failed breeders that moved Southward from breeding areas before molting, and were not long-distance vagrants.																			1092-6194						2004	11	4					375	382		10.1656/1092-6194(2004)011[0375:IOODIS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2004)011[0375:IOODIS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000226177200002

Here, projections of a cumulative WSI (CWSI) known to influence autumn winter waterfowl migration are used to demonstrate the utility of SNOW-17 results. The application of statistically downscaled climate data and a snow model leads to a better representation of lake processes in the Great Lakes basin, topographic effects in the Appalachian Mountains, and spatial patterns of climatological snowfall, compared to the original GCMs. Annual mean snowfall is simulated to decline across the region, particularly in early winter (December January), leading to a delay in the mean onset of the snow season. Because of a warming-induced acceleration of snowmelt, the percentage loss in snow depth exceeds that of snowfall. Across the Plains and Prairie Potholes LCC and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes LCC, daily snowfall events are projected to become less common but more intense. The greatest reductions in the number of days per year with a present snowpack are expected close to the historical position of the -5 degrees C isotherm in December March, around 44 degrees N.

J	JANSSON, M				JANSSON, M			NUTRIENT BUDGETS AND THE REGULATION OF NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS IN A SMALL SUB-ARCTIC LAKE IN NORTHERN SWEDEN	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The hydrology and water chemistry in the watershed of Lake Stugsjon, a small lake in the subarctic region of northern Sweden, were studied for 5 yr. Of the total yearly runoff, 80% occurs during the spring thaw in May and June and largely regulates the nutrient loading. The ice-free period of the lake is June-Oct. Atmospheric deposition of N and P was among the lowest recorded anywhere, in spite of which it accounts for approximately half of the total summer nutrient loading. Dry fall-out made up the major part of the total atmospheric deposition of N and P during the summer. Conductivity measurements showed that the major constituents were not influenced by processes within the lake. The N concentration in the lake during the summer was probably regulated by benthic algae which assimilated inorganic N from the sediments and released organic N to the lake water. P loading and water temperature in combination showed a clear relationship with the mean concentration of chlorophyll-a during the ice-free period.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	3					213	231		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01505.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01505.x													WOS:A1979GW23800005

On the Sentinel-3 OLCI data, the C2RCC algorithm showed the highest accuracy and overall performance stability (RMSE: 0.0014-0.0051 Sr-1, MAPE: 18.44%-68.47%, and BIAS: from -3.68% to 23.63%). The highest correlation was observed between the three-band ratio (B9 + B18)/B10 and the in situ TSM; the TSM inversion model constructed based on this inversion factor showed the best accuracy for the Nanyi Lake (R-2: 0.76, RMSE: 5.01 mg/L, and MAPE: 28.46%). The spatial and temporal changes in TSM in the Nanyi Lake exhibited significant regularity. Specifically, the TSM was higher in 2018-2019, significantly decreased in 2020, and stabilized in 2021-2023. Owing to the effects of human activities, precipitation, and illumination, seasonal variation in the TSM in the Nanyi Lake was detected, with TSM decreasing in the following order: summer > autumn > spring > winter. Concerning spatial variations, high TSM was observed in the northwest, northeast, and southeast of the Nanyi Lake reclamation area and its surrounding lake area. River confluence and human activities affected the area, leading to significant fluctuations in TSM in 2018-2023.						tao, zui/0000-0002-8369-4452													1939-1404	2151-1535					2024	17						10380	10389		10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3402963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3402963													WOS:001246279000013

Preliminary observations on the preservation of organic-walled algae in shallow, freshwater lakes from south-central Missouri, USA	PALYNOLOGY												Algal palynomorphs can provide key ecological information about aquatic environments, yet the preservation potential for most varieties of algae is poorly understood. Cores from Pine Forest and Bray Area lakes, two man-made lakes in the Rolla area of south-central Missouri, USA, provided an opportunity to relate the algal palynomorphs in the top 9 cm of sediments to the processes that lead to preservation. By comparing algal palynomorphs in the sediments to the algal crop in the water, this study seeks to assess the effects of taphonomy on the assemblage in a palynological sample. The lakes were ecologically monitored four times in one year (late fall, spring, summer, winter) to determine the algal crop, and surficial sediment was sampled in Pine Forest Lake once in early winter. The annual average abundance of algae in the lake water was compared with sediment data, and statistical techniques (Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Pielou's Equitability index) were used to determine ecological stability in the sediments. While Sphaerocystis and Ceratium hirundinella did not apparently preserve well, moderate to high preservation potential was determined for Staurastrum and Botryococcus. In addition, Pediastrum simplex var. pseudoglabrum, P. integrum and P. boryanum var. pseudoglabrum were well preserved in the sediments. This preliminary study shows that a highly abundant algal species in the water may not be well preserved in the sediment. Therefore, higher resolution studies are needed to further explore the preservation potential of algae in lake sediments.																			0191-6122	1558-9188				FEB	2017	41	1					72	88		10.1080/01916122.2015.1091042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.2015.1091042													WOS:000395117000005

Warmer waters increase the larval sea lamprey's (Petromyzon marinus) tolerance to the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Invasive sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) in the Great Lakes are controlled by applying the pesticide (lampricide) 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) to waters infested with larval lamprey. However, treatment effectiveness can be undermined by "residual" larval sea lamprey that survive TFM exposure, and subsequently complete metamorphosis into parasitic juvenile sea lamprey that prey on culturally and economically important fishes. We investigated how season and temperature influenced the TFM tolerance of larval sea lamprey. Acute toxicity tests on lamprey collected from the Au Sable River, Michigan, revealed that the 12-h LC50 and LC99.9 were 2.0- to 2.5-fold greater in late spring and summer, than in early spring and fall. Subsequent toxicity tests indicated that greater TFM tolerance in summer was due to warmer temperatures, based on an almost 2-fold greater 12-h LC50 and LC99.9 in warm (24 degrees C) compared to cool (6 degrees C) water. Variations in energy stores (glycogen, lipid, protein) or condition did not appear to affect TFM sensitivity. We conclude that higher water temperature is the primary factor driving the larval sea lamprey's greater tolerance to TFM during the summer, possibly due to an increase in their capacity to detoxify TFM. Considering seasonal variations in temperature may be prudent when selecting and treating sea lamprey infested streams with TFM to minimize treatment residuals. In the longer term, increases in average and peak water temperatures due to climate change could result in greater TFM requirements and costs due to the greater tolerance of larval sea lamprey to TFM at warmer temperatures.

The climate parameters identified that relate to the present-day pollen distribution of the nine most important pollen types (Nothofagus dombeyi-type, Nothofagus obliqua-type, Podocarpus, Weinmannia, Caldcluvia/Eucryphia-type, Cupressaceae, Myrtaceae, Misodendrum and steppe-types) are summer precipitation, summer and winter temperatures. Using the modern pollen/climate data set, three fossil pollen records (Mallin Aguado and Lago Moreno, east of the Andes, and Caunahue, west of the Andes) are interpreted in terms of these three seasonal climate parameters. Despite intervals of no-analog fossil pollen assemblages, the reconstruction shows similar climate trends on both sides of the Andes during the last 21000 cal. yr BP (17 000 yr BP), with summer precipitation as low or markedly lower than today prior to 17000 cal. yr BP (14500 yr BP), as high or higher than today between 15 000 and 12 500 cal. yr BP (12 500 and 10 500 yr BP), and again lower than today between 12 500 and 8000 cal. yr BP (10 500 and 7200 yr BP). Summer and winter temperatures were low (or high) when summer precipitation was high (or low). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations were monitored on a tea garden (TG) hillslope (cultivated) and a bamboo forest (BF) hillslope (naturally vegetated) from September 2019 to February 2022 in the south-eastern hilly area of China. Leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations ranged from 1.07 to 9.83 mg C L-1 and from 0.32 to 11.74 mu g N L-1, respectively, on the TG hillslope, while they ranged from 0.64 to 25.95 mg C L-1 and from 0.23 to 5.68 mu g N L-1, respectively, on the BF hillslope. On both hillslopes, leachate CO2 concentrations were the greatest in summer, while they were the lowest in winter. On the TG hillslope, the highest and the lowest leachate N2O concentrations were observed in spring and summer, respectively, while on the BF hillslope, they were observed in autumn and winter, respectively. On both hillslopes, soil temperature, precipitation during the previous 15 days, and matrix potential were positively related to the leachate CO2 concentrations but not related to the leachate N2O concentrations. Soil water content was positively related to both leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations, while such relationships with groundwater table depth were negative. Leachate total inorganic nitrogen and soil total inorganic nitrogen concentrations were positively related to the leachate N2O concentration on the TG hillslope, while such relationships were not observed on the BF hillslope. Spatial variations of leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations were mainly influenced by land covers, terrain attributes (slope, elevation), soil particle size distribution, bulk density and soil organic matter content. The findings of this study supplemented the knowledge of soil water dissolved CO2 and N2O in the cultivated and naturally vegetated land covers. Further researches are needed to quantify the CO2 and N2O losses through subsurface flow and their contributions to the total soil CO2 and N2O losses.

An assessment of the magnitude and seasonal variation of atmospheric Hg deposition in the Lake Champlain basin was initiated in December 1992 with one year of event precipitation collection, as well as collection of vapor and particle phase Hg in ambient air. Samples were collected at the Vermont Monitoring Cooperative air monitoring site at the Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill Center, VT, The average volume-weighted concentration for Hg in precipitation was 8.3 ng/L for the sampling year and the average amount of Hg deposited with each precipitation event was 0.069 mu g/m(2). The total amount of Hg deposited through precipitation during 1993 was 9.26 mu g/m(2)yr. A seasonal pattern for Hg in precipitation was evident, with increased concentrations and deposition during spring and summer months. Meteorological analysis indicated the highest levels of Hg in precipitation were associated with regional transport from the south regardless of season, and with transport from the west, southwest and northwest during spring and summer months. Concentrations of ambient vapor phase Hg were typical of rural locations and consistent across seasons. Ambient particulate Hg concentrations averaged 11 pg/m(3) with highest concentrations during the winter months.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					353	362		10.1007/BF01189685	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189685													WOS:A1995RM44200040
J	Yang, DQ; Marsh, P; Ge, SQ				Yang, Daqing; Marsh, Philip; Ge, Shaoqing			Heat flux calculations for Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers	POLAR SCIENCE												This study analyzes long-term (40-60 years) discharge and water temperature records collected near the basin outlets of the Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers. It defines seasonal cycles of discharge, water temperature (WT), and heat flux (HF) for the basins, and compares their main features to understand their similarity and difference. Both rivers have similar hydrographs, i.e. low flows in winter and high discharge in summer, with the peak flood in June due to snowmelt runoff. Mackenzie River has many large lakes and they sustain the higher base flows over the fall/winter season. Mackenzie basin is large with high precipitation, thus producing 50% more discharge than the Yukon River to the Arctic Ocean. The WT regimes are also similar between the two rivers. Yukon River WT is about 2-3 degrees C warmer than the Mackenzie over the open water months. Both rivers have the highest WT in the mid summer and they transport large amount of heat to the polar ocean system. Yukon River monthly HF is lower by 10-60% than the Mackenzie mainly due to smaller discharge. Mackenzie River heat transport peaks in July, while the Yukon HF reaches the maximum in June and July. These results provide critical knowledge of river thermal condition and energy transport to the northern seas. They are useful for large-scale climate and ocean model development and validation, and climate/hydrology change research in the northern regions.

J	Nong, XZ; Shao, DG; Shang, YM; Liang, JK				Nong, Xizhi; Shao, Dongguo; Shang, Yuming; Liang, Jiankui			Analysis of spatio-temporal variation in phytoplankton and its relationship with water quality parameters in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China (MRSNWDPC), the longest trans-basin water diversion project in the world, has been in operation for over 6 years. The water quality of this mega hydro-project affects the safety of more than 60 million people and the health of an ecosystem over 160,000 km(2). Abnormal algal proliferation can cause water quality deterioration, eutrophication, and hydro-project operation issues. However, few studies have investigated and reported planktonic algae and their relationship with the water quality of this trans-basin water diversion project. Here, spatio-temporal characteristics of algal cell density (ACD) and 11 water quality parameters, including water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (CODMn), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), fecal coliforms (F. coli), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), fluoride (F-), and sulfate (SO42-) in the MRSNWDPC from May 2015 to February 2019 were determined using multivariate statistical approaches. Consistent seasonal variation in ACD was observed each year, which grew in spring and then continuously decreased from summer to winter. Summer and winter are the seasons with the highest and lowest ACDs, with average values of 572.95 x 10(4) cell/L and 157.09 x 10(4) cell/L, respectively. The NH3-N was positively correlated with ACD growth in all seasons, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.594 to 0.738 (P < 0.01). The results of the principal component analysis show that the sources affecting the water quality variation in this project are complex, and NH3-N was the most critical water quality parameter affecting ACD variation, which was linked to ACD in four seasons with strong positive loadings ranging from 0.754 to 0.882, followed by CODMn. The management department of the MRSNWDPC should focus on key periods of phytoplankton control in spring and summer; in addition, variation in the concentrations of NH3-N and CODMn merits special attention. This study provides a helpful reference for the water quality security and algae control strategy of the MRSNWDPC and similar projects in the world.					shang, Yuming/H-1799-2013; Nong, Xizhi/HWH-0118-2023; Shao, Dongguo/AAB-2115-2021														0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2021	193	9							593	10.1007/s10661-021-09391-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09391-6								34424412					WOS:000687665100004
J	Hodgkin, EP; Hesp, P				Hodgkin, EP; Hesp, P			Estuaries to salt lakes: Holocene transformation of the estuarine ecosystems of south-western Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												When the estuaries of south-western Australia were first flooded by the Holocene marine transgression about 7000 years before present (BP), most were enclosed by limestone barrier dunes. Coastal sand drift built bars and flood-tide deltas in the narrow entrances, but until about 3500 years BP the estuaries remained tidal-dominated systems with a diverse marine-estuarine fauna. Now the bars/deltas so obstruct the small tides that estuary water is fresh in winter and marine to hypersaline in summer; the estuaries are river-flow-dominated systems and the ecosystems are characterised by a restricted euryhaline estuarine biota. Some estuaries are still permanently open, their bars/deltas never close, and some are seasonally open, their bars open with river flow in winter and close in summer. Other estuaries are normally closed, their bars remain closed for several years and break with episodic flood flow, or are permanently closed coastal salt lakes with bars that never or rarely break: they can become grossly hypersaline and may dry up altogether. An hypothesis to explain this Holocene transformation of the estuaries attributes it principally to sedimentary processes in an environment where river flow is highly seasonal, tides are microtidal, there was a fall in sea level, and there are differences in the volume and periodicity of flow and the degree of shelter to the entrances from the prevailing south-west winds and swell.

Seasonal and inter-annual sedimentation in meromictic Lake Shira (Siberia, Russia) during disturbance of meromixis	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Detailed studies of processes of sediment-record formation are necessary for accurate sediment-derived paleo environmental reconstructions. In order to understand the deposition of sediments in meromictic Lake Shira (southern Siberia, Russia), we conducted a multi-year seasonal sediment trap study of sediment fluxes of chemical elements, organic and inorganic carbon, total nitrogen and photosynthetic pigments for a period from 2012 to 2017. In 2015 and 2016, a rare event of transition from meromixis (i.e. long-term hypolimnetic anoxia) to holomixis was observed, which was accompanied by the temporary disappearance of hydrogen sulfide from the water column in spring and a decrease in hydrogen sulfide in other seasons compared to the meromictic state. In general, we did not reveal any noticeable differences between the meromictic and holomictic states in the composition of sediments, except for okenone. The content of okenone, a specific carotenoid of purple sulfur bacteria, decreased in traps during the holomictic state and did not considerably increase two years after the meromixis restoration. Using a freeze-corer, we observed that the content of okenone in the uppermost 3-mm layer of sediments also decreased markedly from 2013 to 2017, as well as in traps. The sedimentation flux of molybdenum reflected the seasonality of hydrogen sulfide content in the water column, and it was maximal in winter, in contrast to all other sediment components. Other components reflected the seasonality of organic production and terrigenous inputs, with the maximum in late summer and autumn. An increase in the sedimentation rate of terrigenous elements in the autumn of 2012 was supposedly caused by the anomalous amount of precipitation in August 2012. Since detailed inter-annual observations of sedimentation processes are not often found in limnology, we hope that our results will be useful for reconstructing regional climate and, further, the understanding of sediment dynamics of stratified temperate water bodies.					; Kolmakova, Anzhelika/ABL-9266-2022; Bulkhin, Alexander/ISB-9320-2023; Kalugin, Ivan/A-5608-2014; Markovich, Tatyana/A-7827-2014; Darin, Andrey/O-3036-2013; Rogozin, Denis/AAE-8113-2019	Bul'hin, Aleksandr/0000-0002-8537-0945; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2023	69	4					359	380		10.1007/s10933-023-00279-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-023-00279-8		FEB 2023											WOS:000928549800001

Using satellite and climate reanalysis datasets and a regional weather research forecasting (WRF) model, we carried out two WRF sensitivity experiments: one including the lake (WRF_lake) and the other with lake replaced by land surface (WRF_nolake). The comparison between the two sensitivity WRF experiments revealed that, in summer, the lake was strong heat sink in the daytime and heat source at night. In autumn, the lake was weak heat sink in the daytime and strong heat source at night. Correspondingly, the precipitation was reduced by about 45-70% over the lake because of the cooling effect in summer of 2008, and the precipitation over the lake and to the east of the lake was enhanced by 60% because of the warming effect of 2008.

J	Vyshnevskyi, V; Shevchuk, S				Vyshnevskyi, Viktor; Shevchuk, Serhii			Thermal regime of the Dnipro Reservoirs	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS												Based on the results of regular monitoring and remote sensing data the patterns of water temperature of the reservoirs cascade on the Dnipro River were identified. A characteristic feature of the thermal regime of the Dnipro Cascade has been the water temperature increase over the past decades. In the period 1977-2020 the water temperature in summer increased by 0.74 degrees C decade(-1), and during May-October by 0.65 degrees C decade(-1). An important factor influencing the thermal regime of the reservoirs is the influence of those ones, located upstream. Water from them is discharged from the lower layer, where the processes of heating and cooling are very slow. This has a significant influence on the water temperature of downstream reservoirs, especially on their upper part. The water temperature in this part during spring and summer seasons is lower compared to natural conditions. In autumn it is higher. The temperature of water also depends on the latitude: it rises in the reservoirs located both downstream and to the south. Another important factor influencing the water temperature is the wind, which can change the temperature in the surface layer by 5-6 degrees C.

A total of 25 pesticide residues were detected in superficial water (89.3 % of the samples). Pesticide's temporal distribution was associated with crops and livestock practices, with higher occurrences in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. The most frequent compounds in superficial water were the insecticide chlorantraniliprole, and the herbicides glyphosate (including its metabolite AMPA) and metolachlor. The levels of Organochlorine pesticide, p,p '-DDT, was in some cases two order of magnitude above the international water quality guidelines for Ambient Water Criteria. In fishes, eight different pesticides were detected, at concentrations from 1000 to 453,000 ng center dot kg-1. The most frequent pesticides found were propiconazole, chlorpyrifos, and p,p '-DDE. The widespread occurrence of pesticides in fish suggests potential exposure effects on fish populations and the aquatic ecosystem. The sampling approach of this work allowed monitoring the continuous concentrations of several pesticides in surface waters and fishes to establish the influence from past and current agriculture practices in Laguna del Cisne basin. For safety measures, continuous monitoring programs must be performed in this system to prevent toxicity impacts on aquatic organisms and human health.					; Pacheco, Martin/NQF-0104-2025; Teixeira de Mello, Franco/AAA-4869-2019; Perez Ortiz, Edwyn/HGD-8377-2022; Goyenola, Guillermo/AAI-6041-2020; heinzen, horacio/AGD-8386-2022	heinzen, horacio/0000-0001-8985-478X; Teixeira de Mello, Franco/0000-0003-4904-6985; Pacheco Rodriguez, Martin/0009-0008-0436-9725; Gerez Garcia, Natalia/0000-0002-8378-7691; Tesitore, Giancarlo/0000-0001-8097-729X; Rodriguez-Bolana, Cesar/0000-0003-2255-2490; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 20	2023	874								162310	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162310		MAR 2023						36828068					WOS:000991949200001

However, a systemic understanding of its governing dynamics remains elusive. Based on model outputs from 13 climate models from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project phase 4 (PMIP4) and proxy records from ACA, here we show that increase in mean precipitation in ACA can be attributed to changes in water vapor source and its transport intensity in winter (December, January, and February) and spring (March, April, and May). In particular, the increase in water vapor supply in winter is associated with the southerly wind anomaly over the northwestern Indian Ocean and Central Asia, caused by an overall weakening of the Asian winter monsoon. This is conducive to water vapor transport from the upwind regions (e.g., Mediterranean) to ACA. Meanwhile, water vapor supply from the eastern Iceland is also enhanced due to a negative North Atlantic Oscillation-like (NAO-like) atmospheric circulation pattern caused by sea ice expansion in the North Atlantic. In spring, evaporation over land and inland lakes is enhanced by increased insolation in the Northern Hemisphere, which increases atmospheric humidity that fuels midlatitude westerlies to enhance ACA precipitation. In addition, weakened atmospheric subsidence over ACA in winter and spring also contributes to the increased precipitation. Overall, our results indicate that paleoclimate modeling is of great importance for disentangling governing dynamics accounting for reconstructed climate phenomena that might be a synergic consequence of several processes operating in different seasons.

Here, we conducted a year-long experiment to explore the effect of warming on bacterial metabolic function of lake water and sediment. Predictions of the metabolic capabilities of these communities were performed with FAPROTAX using 16S rRNA sequencing data. The results indicated that the increase in temperature changed the structure of bacterial metabolic functional groups in water and sediment. During periods of low temperature, the carbon degradation pathway decreased, and the synthesis pathway increased, under the stimulation of warming, especially under the conditions temperature fluctuation. We also observed that nitrogen fixation ability was especially important in the warming treatments during the summer season. However, an elevated temperature significantly led to reduced nitrogen fixation abilities in winter. Compared with the water column, the most predominant functional groups of nitrogen cycle in sediment were nitrite oxidation and nitrification. Variable warming significantly promoted nitrite oxidation and nitrification function in winter, and constant warming was significantly inhibited in spring, with control in sediments. Co-occurrence network results showed that warming, especially variable warming, made microbial co-occurrence networks larger, more connected and less modular, and eventually functional groups in the water column and sediment cooperated to resist warming. We concluded that warming changed bacterial functional potentials important to the biogeochemical cycling in the experimental mesocosms in winter and spring with low temperature. The effect of different bacteria metabolism functions in water column and sediment may change the carbon and nitrogen fluxes in aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, the coupling response between different bacterial metabolic functions in water and sediment may improve the ability to mitigate climate change.

Space use and movements of inland wintering Whooping Cranes in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (AWBP) Whooping Cranes are increasingly using inland areas for a portion of the winter. There have been individuals near Granger Lake during five of the last 13 winters and 11 of the last 13 winters in Colorado and Wharton counties, Texas, USA. At least 11 individuals used Colorado/Wharton counties in 2022-2023, and 18 used this area in 2023- 2024. We used data from all Whooping Cranes with active transmitters from 2009-2018 and from three additional inland wintering individuals from 2017-2022. We compared 95% auto-correlated kernel density estimates (AKDE) and daily distance movements for coastal wintering cranes and those that spent a portion of their winter inland. We also examined daily movement patterns in relation to wintering range use (inland or coastal) considering demographic and temporal factors with generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM). Six marked birds across 10 bird-winters from 2011-2021 spent between 3.1-99.3% of their winter at inland areas. Inland wintering birds had AKDE home ranges that were 3.1 times as large as coastal wintering birds. Additionally, the top GLMM predicted that spending a portion of the winter at inland areas equated to a 92.0 +/- 4.2% increase in daily movement during the winter. We found that several other factors influenced daily movement patterns, which warrant consideration when comparing between the groups. Age and family status impacted the model, but subadults, family groups, and adults without juveniles all had overlapping confidence intervals. Daily movements followed a quadratic temporal pattern, with greater movements in the late fall and early spring. Continued use of inland areas has implications for how we manage, monitor, and plan for this population's recovery.					; Caven, Andrew/AAK-8495-2020; Crouch, Carter/CAA-2341-2022	Butler, Matthew/0000-0001-9864-803X; 													1712-6568					OCT	2024	19	2							16	10.5751/ACE-02746-190216	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02746-190216													WOS:001337570200002

In arid oasis area, only the water of reservoir is available as water resource. The study of hydrochemical characteristics is the prerequisite for evaluating the water quality of domestic water and irrigation water. In the Hongyashan Reservoir, the middle of the Shiyang River Basin and the Tengger desert and Badain Jaran desert, water samples were taken at different points of the lake for about 3 years. The chemical characteristics of the lake water and their influencing factors were studied. The results of the samples for the test have shown that water of the Hongyashan Reservoir is weakly alkaline. And the main compositions of ions in the water are -Ca2+ and HCO -3, hydrochemical type is Ca-HCO3. In terms of the seasonal variation of Hongyashan Reservoir, except for NO -3, the ions in the rest of the water showed roughly the same changeable characteristics in that the composition of ion is higher in summer and autumn, but lower in winter and spring. This is consistent with the seasonal variation in runoff ions throughout the Shiyang River Basin. Ionic characteristics are consistent with the ionic values of dry lakes in the world, which are suitable for urban water and water for irrigation, but are slightly higher than the global lake background standard. Carbonate weathering products are the main source of water ions in Hongyashan Reservoir, and evaporation also affects the ion characteristics of water.

Multi-Year Analysis of Rain-Snow Levels at Marquette, Michigan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study uses observations from a ground-based instrument suite to investigate the rain-snow level (RSL) in stratiform rainfall from January 2014 to April 2020 in the Upper Great Lakes Region. The height above the surface where ice melts to rain, the rain-snow level, influences microphysical assumptions in remote sensing precipitation retrievals and the ability of space-based radar to discriminate surface precipitation phase because of ground clutter. The instrument suite is installed at the Marquette, MI (MQT) National Weather Service station adjacent to Lake Superior. Rain events and the RSLs are studied through a ground-based vertically profiling radar (Micro Rain Radar), a custom NASA-developed video disdrometer (Precipitation Imaging Package), and reanalysis products from ECMWF ERA5 and NASA MERRA-2. Distinct macro and microphysical characteristics are observed in precipitation events with shallow RSLs (<1.8 km above ground level [AGL]) and intermediate RSLs (>1.8 km AGL). Intermediate RSLs correspond to rain events with relatively higher rain rates and a higher concentration of small drops in the drop size distributions (DSDs). Shallow RSL DSDs contain relatively higher concentrations of large drops with lower fall speeds suggesting that partially melted snowflakes may be reaching the surface. Reflectivity-rain-rate relationships are also impacted by microphysical differences associated with RSL regimes. Radar-detected RSLs agree with reanalysis-derived melt levels-especially at wet-bulb isotherms of 0.5 degrees C and 1 degrees C. Seasonal differences such as shallow RSLs in winter, fall, and spring have subsequent implications for satellite detectability. Plain Language Summary The height above the surface where falling snow melts to rain, the rain-snow level (RSL), can be detected by both ground-based and space-based radars. However, space-based radars are limited in their ability to capture precipitation near the surface due to interference. This work investigates RSLs between January 2014 and April 2020 from ground-based observations at the Marquette, MI National Weather Service office. This work includes observations from ground-based profiling radar and a custom NASA-developed instrument that records high resolution videos of precipitation at the surface. In addition, profile temperature and moisture data are used. These products are commonly used with satellite observations to determine the surface precipitation phase. The results show different characteristics for rain events with shallow and intermediate RSLs. The radar-detected RSLs illustrate good agreement with melt levels derived from reanalysis profile data, which is useful for satellite retrievals of precipitation. Seasonal differences such as shallow rain-snow levels in winter, fall, and spring have subsequent implications for satellite detectability.

J	Goyette, S; Perroud, M				Goyette, Stephane; Perroud, Marjorie			Interfacing a one-dimensional lake model with a single-column atmospheric model: Application to the deep Lake Geneva, Switzerland	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A single column atmospheric model (SCM) coupled to a one-dimensional lake model devised for climate simulations is described in this paper. As a test case, this coupled model is applied to the deepest section of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. Both atmospheric and lake models require a minimal set of adjustable parameters to reproduce the local observations of temperature, moisture, and wind as well as those of the lake thermal profiles. A number of simulations have been performed to produce a sorted set of optimal model parameters that reproduces the mean and the variability of the seasonal evolution of the thermal profiles in the lake as well as those of the mean and the variability of the surface air temperature, moisture, and winds. The lake water temperature is reproduced realistically using the optimal calibration parameter values with a seasonal-and depth-averaged error of 0.41 degrees C in summer, -0.15 degrees C in autumn, 0.01 degrees C in winter, and 0.27 degrees C in spring when compared to the lake observations. Also, the errors of the seasonally averaged simulated anemometer-level wind speed, screen-level air temperature, and specific humidity to the station-derived values are 0.04 m s(-1), 1.04 degrees C, and 0.74 g kg(-1), respectively. Results of this study contribute to the understanding of the air-lake interactions present over the deep Lake Geneva. In addition, the sensitivity experiments carried out in this paper serve as the basis for experiments aiming at studying the thermal response of the deep Swiss Lake Geneva under future global climate change conditions reported in a companion paper.

Treatment With Synthetic Brood Pheromone (SuperBoost) Enhances Honey Production and Improves Overwintering Survival of Package Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Colonies	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												We evaluated a year-long treatment regime testing synthetic, 10-component, honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), brood pheromone (SuperBoost; Contech Enterprises Inc., Delta, BC, Canada) on the productivity and vigor of package bee colonies in the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Fifty-eight newlyestablished 1.3-kg (3-lb) colonies treated three times with SuperBoost at 5-wk intervals starting 30 April 2009 were compared with 52 untreated control colonies. Treated colonies produced 84.3% more honey than untreated control colonies. By 8 September 2009, SuperBoost-treated colonies had 35.4% more adults than untreated colonies. By 28 September, net survival of treated and control colonies was 72.4 and 67.3%, respectively. On 5 October, treated and control colonies were divided into two additional groups, making up four cohorts: SuperBoost-treated colonies treated again during fall and spring build-up feeding with pollen substitute diet (BeePro, Mann Lake Ltd., Hackensack, MN; TTT); controls that remained untreated throughout the year (CCC); colonies treated with SuperBoost in spring-summer 2009 but not treated thereafter (TCC); and original control colonies treated with SuperBoost during the fall and spring build-up feeding periods (CTT). There was no difference among cohorts in consumption of BeePro during fall feeding, but TTT colonies (including daughter colonies split off from parent colonies) consumed 50.8% more diet than CCC colonies during spring build-up feeding. By 21 April, the normalized percentages of the original number of colonies remaining (dead colonies partially offset by splits) were as follows: CCC, 31.4%; CTT, 43.8%; TCC, 53.59%; and TTT, 80.0%. The net benefit of placing 100 newly established package bee colonies on a year-long six-treatment regime with SuperBoost would be US$6,202 (US$62.02 per colony). We conclude that treatment with SuperBoost enhanced the productivity and survival of package bee colonies and hypothesize that similar results could be achieved with established colonies.

Modeled fluxes and loadings to the great lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Atmospheric loadings of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) from May 1, 1998, to April 30, 1999, to the Great Lakes simulated by a coupled soil-air and water-air atmospheric transport model are presented. Modeling results on an annual basis indicate that Lake Superior received the highest dry deposition load of 2.17 kg yr(-1). Dry deposition to the lower Great Lakes (Lakes Erie and Ontario) was 2-6 times lower as compared to the upper Great Lakes. Greater deposition in the upper Great Lakes is due mainly to their larger surface area and greater proximity to sources of gamma-HCH. Dry deposition fluxes (pg m(-1)) to lake surfaces were much lower than to land as a result of lower deposition velocities and lower air concentrations of gamma-HCH over the lakes. The highest gamma-HCH loading (kg yr(-1), in 1998-99) due to wet deposition occurred for Lake Ontario. This was mainly attributed to greater annual rainfall over Lake Ontario. An investigation of average seasonal fluxes predicted by the model shows that deposition fluxes to the Great Lakes are considerably higher in the summer than that in the autumn and winter seasons. The net direction of gas exchange also exhibits a seasonal dependence. Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario show net absorption in the summer 1998 whereas at all other times net outgassing occurred at all of the lakes. Overall, gas exchange was the dominant process affecting loadings to the Great Lakes. Model-derived loadings and total deposition flows across the Great Lakes basin due to dry and wet depositions and net gas exchange agree reasonably well with the summer estimates compiled by the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network whereas autumn values show greater discrepancies. Better agreement was also observed for dry deposition as compared to wet deposition. Specifically, to improve short-term loading estimates (e.g., over days to months), the model results indicate the need for better spatially and temporally resolved information on concentrations in air and surface water and better estimates of precipitation and deposition velocities over the lakes.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 15	2004	38	4					984	990		10.1021/es034747b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es034747b								14998008					WOS:000188996600009

Long-term (2010-2020) data on chlorophyll-a, nutrient, and environmental factors were obtained from three Lake Ulansuhai monitoring stations. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of Chl-a were analyzed. Additionally, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm was established to simulate and predict Chl-a, and sensitivity analysis revealed the interaction between environmental factors and eutrophication. The results indicated that (1) the seasonal variation of eutrophication showed an obvious trend of spring > summer > autumn > winter, and the concentration of Chl-a in the inlet was significantly higher than that in the outlet; (2) The inlet, center, and outlet of Ulansuhai Lake are satisfactorily affected by HEA in the best suited method. The fitting coefficients (R-2) of the optimal models were 0.58, 0.59, and 0.62 for the three monitoring stations, and the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 3.89, 3.21, and 3.56, respectively; (3) under certain range and threshold conditions, Chl-a increased with the increase of permanganate index, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and ammonia nitrogen concentration, but decreased with the increase of water depth, Secchi disk depth, pH, and fluoride concentration. The results indicate that the HEA can simulate and predict the dynamics of Chl-a, and identify and quantify the relationships between eutrophication and the threshold data. The research results provide theoretical basis and technical support for the prediction and have great significance for the improvement of water quality and environmental protection in arid and semi-arid inland lakes.

J	Makineci, HB				Makineci, Hasan Bilgehan			Seasonal drought analysis of Aksehir Lake with temporal combined sentinel data between 2017 and 2021 spring and autumn	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The threat of drought has been felt almost worldwide in recent years. It is critical to determine the causes of drought and how seasonal changes affect it. Additionally, it is necessary to determine the speed and impact area of drought, monitor drought areas, and attempt to find solutions against drought. With the developing satellite sensing systems, remote sensing methods are being used to investigate topics such as the increase and extent of drought, uncontrolled water consumption in agricultural activities, and the effects of unnatural pollutants on freshwater resources such as lakes and rivers. Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data to monitor changes in water bodies is a relatively new area of study in remote sensing. The spatial extent and seasonal change (spring and autumn) of droughts between 2017 and 2021 in Aksehir Lake were determined from Sentinel-1A SAR satellite data, and the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) was calculated using Sentinel-2A optical satellite data and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in this research. In addition, a different approach was applied to determine the change of wetland boundaries more accurately by converting the linear Sigma0 band to the decibel (dB) band and applying a non-linear 3 x 3 maximum filter to the dB band to Sentinel-1A data. Consequently, it has been established that Aksehir Lake, which used to have wetlands during the spring seasons but began to dry up in the autumn seasons, had completely dried up in both periods in 2021.

Competition potential between saugers and walleyes in nonnative sympatry	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Sauger Sander canadensis populations throughout North America have exhibited declines over the past few decades. Various factors may be contribute to the reduced population abundance of saugers in the middle Missouri River of Montana, including interspecific competition with walleyes Sander vitreus. We compared the seasonal migrations, habitat use, and diets of both species in the middle Missouri River to assess competition potential. Before the presumed spawning period, 96% of saugers and 57% of walleyes migrated as far as 264 kilometers downstream. After spawning, both species returned to previously occupied river reaches and demonstrated site fidelity during the nonmigratory season. Habitat use by saugers and walleyes was similar at three hierarchical spatial scales. Diet overlap was high during the spring and summer and moderate during autumn. Resource overlap of saugers and walleyes in the middle Missouri River of Montana suggests that the competition potential between these species is high, which may preclude the recovery of native sauger populations where resources are limiting.																			0002-8487					MAY	2008	137	3					790	800		10.1577/T07-102.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-102.1													WOS:000256288000012

Egg-carrying leeches occurred from early June to mid-July. Young were released from parents in August, and the old cohort died soon after. The mean weight of recruited young increased in early autumn, declined over winter due to low feeding activity, and increased again from early spring until the leeches reproduced. The disappearance of leeches from the littoral zone in winter was due to their migration into deeper waters. Six species of snails collected from shallow and deep waters did not harbour leeches inside their shells or mantle cavities at any time of the year. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the leech does not use snails as a refuge. A serological technique identified the gut contents of field-collected A. heteroclita. Leeches had fed most extensively on oligochaetes followed by snails and then chironomids, lightly on Asellus and caddisflies, and scarcely on amphiphods and cladocerans. In laboratpry experiments, in which four prey taxa were offered simultaneously to leeches, the descending order of utilization was oligochaetes, chironomids, Asellus and snails.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 20	1987	150	2					133	139		10.1007/BF00006660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006660													WOS:A1987J183600004
J	RIJSTENBIL, JW				RIJSTENBIL, JW			PHYTOPLANKTON COMPOSITION OF STAGNANT AND TIDAL ECOSYSTEMS IN RELATION TO SALINITY, NUTRIENTS, LIGHT AND TURBULENCE	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												One of the main characteristics of the Delta area in the southwestern Netherlands is the wide variety of brackish water types. Phytoplankton developments were compared in a small mesohaline and polyhaline lake, and in a mesohaline and polyhaline part of an open estuary. Salinity differences affected phytoplankton distribution. This was most evident in diatoms of marine origin. In the mesohaline waters relatively euryhaline marine species of diatoms were found: Skeletonema costatum in all water types, and Actinocyclus ehrenbergii only in the estuary. Thalassiosira nordenskioldii and Ditylum brightwellii showed some tolerance to a mesohaline environment. Detonula confervacea and the stenohaline Rhizosolenia delicatula were limimted to the polyhaline waters. Both the relative abundance and the mean size of the diatoms increased with the degree of turbulence in the systems, which was low (except in early spring) in the lakes, but high in the tidal system. In spring, diatom blooms were a regular phenomenon in the mesohaline and polyhaline lakes. Ammonium was depleted during the diatom blooms in spring. Nitrate was depleted by flagellates, small diatoms, and green algae in the top of the photic zone of the lakes. As a result, nitrogen was limiting phytoplankton growth in summer and in autumn. At the estuarine locations large diatoms were found to be suspended in the completely mixed water column.																			0077-7579					JUN	1987	21	2					113	123		10.1016/0077-7579(87)90027-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(87)90027-5													WOS:A1987J335800004

Of four birds tracked in 1994, one crossed the Sea of Japan and covered 900 km in 13 h on 31 March. It reached the mainland near Vladivostock, then headed north via Khanka Lake and the Saujiang Plain in China to the mouth of the Amur River in northern Russia. The distance from the wintering site to its summer site was about 2,000 km. The three other swans, followed for shorter periods in 1994, were recorded at various points along the Japanese Islands. Of a further four swans fitted with satellite transmitters in 1997, two crossed the Sea of Japan. One of these then headed north to the mouth of the Amur River, following a very similar route to the bird tracked in 1994. The other two swans followed a route along the islands of Japan, heading north until mid April when their transmitters failed. These observations suggest that Bewick's Swans wintering at Lake Nakaumi follow at least two migration routes in spring, one along Japanese islands, and the other directly across the Sea of Japan.																			1524-4695						2002	25			1			128	131																WOS:000180160100017

Planktivory rates changed by an order of magnitude during this time period, primarily due to the rise and fall of the 1977 year class of cisco (Coregonus artedi) that dominated planktivory rates for a period of 10 yr. Planktivory increased between 1977 and 1978 due to an increase in biomass of that year class and decreased in August 1987 after a summer kill of cisco in the lake. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and other cisco year classes contributed <25% of the total planktivory during 1978 to 1987. Time series analysis revealed that this 10-yr pulse in planktivory rates was associated with changes in the Daphnia species and biomass. In years with low planktivory rates, higher biomass of daphnids dominated by Daphnia pulicaria developed earlier in the spring and lasted longer into the summer. This was also associated with an earlier and longer spring clear-water phase. In years with high planktivory rates, daphnid biomass was generally lower and dominated by the smaller Daphnia galeata mendotae. However, there was no significant effect of planktivory on the early summer peak in Daphnia biomass that is associated with a clear-water phase. The dynamics of this Daphnia peak are apparently regulated by Daphnia-algae interactions and not by planktivory rates. The seasonal and interyear changes in Daphnia species composition can be explained by the combined effects of planktivory, dynamics of food resources, and the physiological ecology of the two Daphnia species. There was no significant effect of increased planktivory on total zooplankton biomass due to a compensatory increase in cyclopoid copepods and no response by calanoid copepods. The recent history of Lake Mendota illustrates a 10-yr period of predation imposed by a single year class of a large, long-lived, obligate planktivore. It is an example of variability in a lake ecosystem scaled to the life-span of a dominant fish species.

R.; Andersen, Nils; Anoop, A.; Jehangir, Arshid; Yaseen, Tabasum; Gaye, Birgit; Stebich, Martina			Impact of precipitation and temperature changes on limnology and sediment characteristics in NW Himalaya	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												In recent decades, the ecologically sensitive region of NW Himalaya, a transition zone between the westerlies and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), has witnessed extreme precipitation events as well as an increase in seasonal temperatures, the impact of which on the lacustrine systems is unknown. In this study, we use a two-pronged approach involving (1) reconstruction of precipitation pathways and moisture sources using the HYSPLIT model during years with extreme (seasonal) precipitation in NW Himalaya; and (2) documentation of the impact of climate extremes on limnology and sediment characteristics by comparing mu-XRF and mineralogical data from a Manasbal Lake sediment core (Kashmir) with the lake monitoring data. Our results show that (a) the most significant change in precipitation pathways is observed during summer when the Bay of Bengal branch of the ISM, in addition to the Arabian Sea branch, also contributes to the regional precipitation; (b) moisture pathways from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea at different levels also indicate that moisture availability at mid tropospheric level plays an important role in creating extreme wet conditions over Kashmir during the summer monsoon season. In the years with above normal spring precipitation, back trajectories from the Arabian Sea and the Middle East carry more moisture at 1.5 km and 5 km levels; (c) the sub-decadal extremes in seasonal tem-perature and precipitation can be linked to drier events preserved in the core demonstrating the high sensitivity of the lake systems to short term climate variability; (d) changes in hydrochemistry resulting from inflow of groundwater can provide insights into prolonged anoxia and hypolimnion ventilation; (e) the lake level appears to be insensitive to isolated extreme rainfall events, and anomalous winter and spring warming observed in recent decades. The results of this study have wider implications for understanding changes in moisture path-ways and sources during prolonged extreme events, and their impact on lacustrine systems.					; Gaye, Birgit/J-4621-2012; Mishra, Praveen K./AAC-7064-2022; Ambili, Anoop/AAR-7122-2020; Jehangir, Arshid/AAC-9077-2021	Mishra, Praveen K./0000-0003-3860-892X; Ambili, Anoop/0000-0002-4279-7842; Gaye, Birgit/0000-0002-5057-899X; Andersen, Nils/0000-0003-4148-6791; Jehangir, Arshid/0000-0002-4877-609X													0883-2927	1872-9134				FEB	2022	137								105200	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105200		JAN 2022											WOS:000799842900001

The Arabian Sea summer monsoon stack lags by 8 +/- 1 kyr, consistent with 13 other Indian and East Asian summer monsoon proxies from marine, lake, and terrestrial archives. This 5 kyr phase difference cannot be attributed to age control inadequacies in the marine chronology; it requires reconciliation in the context of proxy interpretation. Both of these lags are incompatible with a direct response to northern hemisphere summer insolation, implicating additional forcing mechanisms. Analysis of heterodynes in the cave delta O-18 spectrum demonstrates that variance contained in the Arabian Sea summer monsoon proxies also resides in the cave delta O-18 record. This variance is subtracted from the cave delta O-18 record yielding a residual that is highly coherent and in phase with precession minima, reflecting the impact of winter temperature change on cave delta O-18 (meteorological precipitation under cold conditions). Thus, we argue that the timing of light cave delta O-18 peaks cannot be interpreted as reflecting the timing of strong summer monsoons alone. The 2.9 kyr precession band phase lag of cave delta O-18 reflects the combined influence of summer monsoon forcing with a phase lag of 8 kyrs relative to precession minima and winter temperature forcing that is in phase with precession minima. This interpretation is consistent with modern seasonality in the amount and isotopic composition of rainfall in southeast China.

J	SOMMER, U; GAEDKE, U; SCHWEIZER, A				SOMMER, U; GAEDKE, U; SCHWEIZER, A			THE 1ST DECADE OF OLIGOTROPHICATION OF LAKE CONSTANCE .2. THE RESPONSE OF PHYTOPLANKTON TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION	OECOLOGIA												In Lake Constance, after several decades of eutrophication, a decrease in phosphorus loading over the last decade has lead to a partial recovery from eutrophication. Here we analyse the shift in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton during the first decade of oligotrophication in Lake Constance. During the 1980s, spring total P concentrations decreased from ca. 130 to less than 50 mu . 1-1. This decrease was reflected by an approximately proportional decrease in summer phytoplankton biomass while spring phytoplankton biomass seemed unresponsive. Major taxonomic changes occured during both growth seasons. In spring, the proportion of diatoms, green algae and Chrysophyta increased while the proportion of Cryptophyta decreased. The summer trend was very different: the relative importance of diatoms decreased and Cryptophyta and Chrysophyta increased, while Chlorophyta reached their peak around 1985. These trends are also analysed at the genus level. Comparison with taxonomic trends during the eutrophication period shows the expected reversals in most cases. Comparison with other lakes shows general similarities, with the notable exception that Planktothrix rubescens has never been important in Lake Constance. The increase of diatoms during spring is attributed to their improved competitive performance with increasing Si:P ratios. Their decrease during summer is explained by the increasing silicate removal from the epilimnion by increasing spring populations.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				MAR	1993	93	2					276	284		10.1007/BF00317682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317682								28313618					WOS:A1993KR75300020
J	Jeong, YH; Choi, YH; Kwak, DH				Jeong, Yong-Hoon; Choi, Yong -Ho; Kwak, Dong-Heui			Effects of dissolved oxygen changes in the benthic environment on phosphorus flux at the sediment-water interface in a coastal brackish lake	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In semi -enclosed coastal brackish lakes, changes in dissolved oxygen in the bottom layer due to salinity stratification can affect the flux of phosphorus (P) at the sediment -water interface, resulting in short- and long-term water quality fluctuations in the water column. In this study, the physicochemical properties of the water layers and sediments at five sites in Saemangeum Lake were analyzed in spring and autumn for four years, and phosphorus release experiments from sediments were conducted for 20 days under oxic and anoxic conditions during the same period. Sediment total phosphorus (T -P) decreased in autumn compared to spring due to mineralization of organic bound phosphorus, which was the most dominant P fraction. This may be related to the increase in the ratio of PO 4 - P to T -P in bottom waters in autumn, when hypoxia was frequently observed. The difference in P fluxes between oxic and anoxic conditions indicated that during autumn, as compared to spring, the release of phosphorus could have a more immediate impact on the water column during the formation of hypoxia/anoxia. The main factors influencing changes in P fluxes from sediments were identified through redundancy analysis. Additionally, based on the results of multiple regression analysis, sediment TOC, sediment non -apatite phosphorus, porewater pH, and porewater PO 4 - P were determined to be the most significant factors affecting P fluxes from sediments, depending on the season or redox conditions. Recently, the increased influx of seawater into Saemangeum Lake has been shown to contribute to water quality improvements in the water column due to a strong dilution effect. However, the sediment environment has shifted towards a more reduced state, leading to increased P release under anoxic conditions. Therefore, for future water quality management within the lake, it is necessary to consistently address the recurring hypoxia and continuously monitor phosphorus dynamics.					; Choi, Yong-Ho/AAD-7708-2020; Jeong, Yong/C-1680-2011	Kwak, Dong-Heui/0000-0001-5692-7372; 													0141-1136	1879-0291				APR	2024	196								106439	10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106439		MAR 2024						38479292					WOS:001221943900001

Autumn waterbird migration over Lake Superior: Numbers, species, and timing	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Great Lakes are used as a migratory corridor and for feeding by tens of thousands of waterbirds each spring and fall, yet little species-specific information is available regarding numbers, seasonal timing, and connectivity along the route. The objective of this study was to use land-based surveys to quantify fall migration at two important landmarks in Lake Superior for an assemblage of waterbirds from three orders (Anseriformes, Gaviiformes, and Podicipediformes). Both the Keweenaw Peninsula (KP) and Whitefish Point (WP) showed a temporal pattern of high numbers (peaking at 9000 and 16,000, respectively) in the first 3 h after dawn and a decline (dropping to 1000 and 5000, respectively) over the following 5 h, although the decline was far more abrupt at KP than at WP. Fall totals for WP were nearly 85,000 individual waterbirds, and for KP about 34,500. Species abundance rankings were generally similar for both locations, with the most common species being long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), greater scaup (Aythya marila), and red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator). Most species were far more numerous at WP than at KP, with long-tailed ducks being 65 times more numerous. A notable exception was redhead (Aythya americana), which was 33% more numerous at KP than at WP. We suggest that during the fall, Lake Superior acts as a geographic funnel concentrating waterbirds from northwest to southeast and that details of the composition, timing and amplitude of this phenomenon are important considerations for any nearshore Great Lakes development.

Discharge of municipal and agricultural wastewater into the receiving water resources make desirable conditions for algae growth and consequently cause eutrophication phenomena. Water samples were withdrawn monthly from 5 stations in Zabol City within spring and summer seasons. To identify algae species, micronutrients, and physical parameters such as temperature, depth of Secchi disk (SD) and pH on their growth were evaluated. The average phosphate in spring and summer were observed to be 0.034 and 0.028 mg/L, respectively. The results obtained from the present study indicated that the volume and depth of the water reservoirs were less critical on total phosphorus compared with the concentration of algal cells and total nitrogen. The mean pH for water samples taken from Chah Niemeh (CN) in spring and summer were observed to be 8.4 which is suitable for algae growth. Furthermore, the mean temperature (>20 degrees C) in both seasons were found to be desirable for the growth of algae, especially cyanobacteria in the CN. Moreover, the mean SD in spring and summer samples was 96.16 m and 119.83 m, respectively. As a result, the reservoir had low transparency in terms of algal growth. Totally, most of the identified algae were green algae (50%), algal flagella (19%), cyanobacteria (15.4%) and diatoms (15%). Therefore, cyanobacteria are most possible responsible for the taste and odor in the CN water reservoir. Future efforts should be directed toward preventive measurements for protecting water reservoirs from municipal and agricultural wastewaters and algae control.					; Ebrahimzadeh, gholamreza/V-8599-2017; Alimohammadi, Mahmood/M-1286-2017	Mahvi, Amir Hossein/0000-0001-8733-1483; 														2052-336X				JUN	2021	19	1					437	443		10.1007/s40201-021-00616-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40201-021-00616-x		JAN 2021						34150247					WOS:000609985500003

Lakes as nitrous oxide sources in the boreal landscape	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Estimates of regional and global freshwater N2O emissions have remained inaccurate due to scarce data and complexity of the multiple processes driving N2O fluxes the focus predominantly being on summer time measurements from emission hot spots, agricultural streams. Here, we present four-season data of N2O concentrations in the water columns of randomly selected boreal lakes covering a large variation in latitude, lake type, area, depth, water chemistry, and land use cover. Nitrate was the key driver for N2O dynamics, explaining as much as 78% of the variation of the seasonal mean N2O concentrations across all lakes. Nitrate concentrations varied among seasons being highest in winter and lowest in summer. Of the surface water samples, 71% were oversaturated with N2O relative to the atmosphere. Largest oversaturation was measured in winter and lowest in summer stressing the importance to include full year N2O measurements in annual emission estimates. Including winter data resulted in fourfold annual N2O emission estimates compared to summer only measurements. Nutrient-rich calcareous and large humic lakes had the highest annual N2O emissions. Our emission estimates for Finnish and boreal lakes are 0.6 and 29 Gg N2O-N/year, respectively. The global warming potential of N2O from lakes cannot be neglected in the boreal landscape, being 35% of that of diffusive CH4 emission in Finnish lakes.

Although this mysid is common in the Rhine and Danube rivers, little is known about its ecology and impact in systems of invasion. We investigated the autecology of L. benedeni in habitat-choice and food experiments. In the habitat-choice experiments, highly structured habitats, i.e., stones covered with zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), macrophytes, and especially stonewort, were strongly preferred. In food experiments, L. benedeni fed mostly on food sources with a small particle size, e.g., biofilm on leaf litter, biodeposited material of zebra mussels, epilithon, and phytoplankton. We also compared the L. benedeni population data from Lake Constance with that from rivers. In Lake Constance, female L. benedeni were nearly 30% larger and carried more than three times more eggs in spring (9.4 +/- 0.6 mm and 28.4 +/- 5.7 eggs) than in summer (6.7 +/- 0.8 mm and 8.7 +/- 2.9 eggs). The mysids present in spring might be the generation that over-wintered; in summer, this generation was probably replaced by a new generation of smaller individuals. The large brood size and the detritivorous feeding strategy might allow L. benedeni to colonize Lake Constance rapidly. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Seasonal and Spatial Distribution of Walleye Sex Ratios in a Large Nebraska Reservoir	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The ratio of female to male Walleye Sander vitreus across the spatial scale of large reservoirs and during nonspawning times receives little attention, even though standardized sampling occurs during this time. This study evaluated whether the proportion of female Walleye collected from seasonal sampling at different spatial areas within a large reservoir fell within the 0.450-0.550 range, which would closely reflect a 1:1 female-to-male sex ratio. We used a Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effects model with a binomial probability distribution to assess the proportion of female Walleye, using season (spring and fall) and reservoir zone (riverine, transitional, and lacustrine) as fixed effects and year (2015 and 2016) as a random effect. We collected a total of 2,163 Walleye using standardized Nebraska Game and Parks Commission gill-netting methodology and determined sex on a random subsample of fish (n 1/4 989) collected throughout each reservoir zone. There was no meaningful deviation from the 0.450-0.550 range in the mean posterior estimate of the proportion of female Walleye caught in the riverine and transitional zones during either spring or fall. The mean (SD) posterior estimate of the proportion of female Walleye in the lacustrine zone was 0.182 (0.024) in the spring and 0.621 (0.032) in the fall. These results are consistent with previous observations of increased male presence near spawning locations in the spring and demonstrate that increased fall female catch in the lacustrine zone could potentially bias sampling results. This study provides further insight into the distribution of sexes across the spatial gradient of a large Great Plains reservoir and demonstrates a need to sex Walleye during standardized fall surveys.																			1944-687X					JUN	2023	14	1					179	187		10.3996/JFWM-22-043	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-22-043													WOS:001037093800006

Compositional changes and biomass fluctuations within the assemblage were observed both in summer and beneath the winter ice cover and are discussed in the context of physicochemical and biotic parameters. Proteobacteria of the beta subclass (beta-proteobacteria) formed a dominant fraction of the bacterioplankton (annual mean, 24% of the total counts), whereas alpha-proteobacteria were of similar relative importance only during spring (mean, 11%). Bacteria of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster, although less abundant, constituted the largest fraction of the filamentous morphotypes during most of the year, thus contributing significantly to the total microbial biomass. Successive peaks of threadlike and rod-shaped archaea were observed during autumn thermal mixing and the period of ice cover formation, respectively. A set of oligonucleotide probes targeted to single phylotypes was constructed from 16S rRNA-encoding gene clone sequences. Three distinct populations of uncultivated microbes, affiliated with the alpha- and beta-proteobacteria, were subsequently monitored by FISH. About one-quarter of all of the beta-proteobacteria (range, 6 to 53%) could be assigned to only two phylotypes. The bacterial populations studied were annually recurrent, seasonally variable, and vertically stratified, except during the periods of lake overturn. Their variability clearly exceeded the fluctuations of the total microbial assemblage, suggesting that the apparent stability of total bacterioplankton abundances may mask highly dynamic community fluctuations.

J	Zhang, D; Wang, C; Zhou, QH; Yuan, XZ				Zhang Dan; Wang Chuan; Zhou Qiaohong; Yuan Xingzhong			Sediments nitrogen cycling influenced by submerged macrophytes growing in winter	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Restoration of submerged macrophytes is one of the important measures for ecological treatment of eutrophic lakes. The changes in physical and chemical conditions caused by submerged macrophytes also affect the process of benthic nitrogen cycling. The growth period of Potamogeton crispus is mainly in winter. In order to understand the effect of submerged macrophytes growing in winter on nitrification rate and denitrification rate in the process of nitrogen cycling, experiments were carried out from winter to summer with vegetated and non-vegetated treatments. The results showed that the effect of submerged macrophytes on water temperature was not significant in winter. The nitrogen cycling was mainly affected by variables, which were inorganic nitrogen and dissolved oxygen. Submerged macrophytes had little effect on nitrification rate, but had a certain inhibition on denitrification rate by providing oxygen from photosynthesis. In total, submerged macrophytes growing in winter have little effect on nitrogen cycling in sediment. However, submerged macrophytes growing in winter can increase the attachment surface of microbes and inhibit resuspension of sediment, which play a complementary role to submerged macrophytes growing in summer for maintaining stability of eutrophic lakes.																			0273-1223	1996-9732				APR 1	2021	83	7					1728	1738		10.2166/wst.2021.081	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2021.081								33843755					WOS:000639447900017

Surface waterbodies in the beautiful Kashmir Himalayas are already deteriorating. In this study, fourteen physio-chemical parameters were tested in water samples taken during the spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons from twenty-six different sampling points. The findings showed a consistent decline in the water quality of river Jhelum and its adjoining tributaries. The upstream section of the river Jhelum had the least pollution, whereas the Nallah Sindh had the poorest water quality. The water quality of Jhelum and Wular Lake was strongly impacted by the water quality of all the adjoining tributaries. To examine the link between the selected water quality indicators, descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix were used. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA) were used to identify the key variables that influenced seasonal and sectional water quality fluctuations. The ANOVA analysis revealed that there were significant differences in water quality characteristics among the twenty-six sampling locations throughout all four seasons. The PCA findings identified four principal components that accounted for 75.18% of the total variance and could be utilized to evaluate all data. The study revealed that chemical, conventional, organic, and organic pollutants were significant latent factors influencing the water quality of rivers in the region. The findings of this study could contribute to the vital management of surface water resources in Kashmir's ecology and environment.					gull, sarvat/ACV-0923-2022; Shah, Shagoofta/ABB-3478-2020; DAR, AYAZ MOHMOOD/R-2688-2016														0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2023	195	6							746	10.1007/s10661-023-11346-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11346-y								37237143					WOS:000995897000006
J	Koiv, T; Kangro, K				Koiv, T; Kangro, K			Resource ratios and phytoplankton species composition in a strongly stratified lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The epilimnetic phytoplankton and its relations to nutrient content in Lake Verevi through the whole vegetation period in 2000 were studied. Lake Verevi (surface 12.6 ha, mean depth 3.6 m, maximum depth I I in) is a hypertrophic hard-water lake, where the so-called spring meromixis occurs due to an extremely warm spring. Most dissolved nutrients in the epilimnion were low already in spring, and their concentrations were quite stable during the study period. The concentration of total silicon was very low in spring but increased rapidly in summer. Total phosphorus followed the pattern for stratified eutrophic lakes, and total nitrogen was quite high. The stoichiometric N:P ratio fluctuated between 25 and 81. The dynamics of phytoplankton biomass with a spring peak from April to May and a late summer peak from July to August is typical of Estonian eutrophic lakes. Green algae and chrysophytes occurred in the phytoplankton throughout the vegetation period. The spring peak was dominated by diatoms (Synedra ulna and Synedra acus var. angustissima) and the summer peak was caused by Aphanizomenon klebahnii and Ceratium hirundinella. The study showed that in physically stratified systems, the total concentration of limiting resources and plain physical factors (light and temperature) may be more important in the determination of phytoplankton dominants than different resource ratios. A combination of light and temperature optimum, along with nutrient utilization and transport capacity, effectively segregates phytoplankton species and can be used for the explanation of seasonal succession pattern.

Trends in Mysis diluviana abundance in the Great Lakes, 2006-2016	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												With the large Diporeia declines in lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario, there is concern that a similar decline of Mysis diluviana related to oligotrophication and increased fish predation may occur. Mysis density and biomass were assessed from 2006 to 2016 using samples collected by the Great Lakes National Program Office's biomonitoring program in April and August in all five Great Lakes. Summer densities and biomasses were generally greater than spring values and both increased with bottom depth. There were no significant time trends during these 10-11 years in lakes Ontario, Michigan, or Huron, but there was a significant increase in Lake Superior. Density and biomass were highest in lakes Ontario and Superior, somewhat lower in Lake Michigan, and substantially lower in Lake Huron. A few Mysis were collected in eastern Lake Erie, indicating a small population in the deep basin of that lake. On average, mysids contributed 12-18% (spring-summer, Michigan), 18-14% (spring-summer, Superior), 30-13% (spring-summer, Ontario), and 3% (Huron) of the total open-water crustacean biomass. Size distributions consisted of two peaks, indicating a 2-year life cycle in all four of the deep lakes. Mysis were larger in Lake Ontario than in lakes Michigan, Superior, and Huron. Comparisons with available historic data indicated that mysid densities were higher in the 1960s-1990s (5 times higher in Huron, 2 times higher in Ontario, and around 40% higher in Michigan and Superior) than in 2006-2016.

The vegetative cells that were obtained were observed after protargol staining and with a scanning microscope and then described. The cysts of S. capitatum were spherical with a papula and spiny surface. Their size varied from 55 to 62 mu m in total length and from 45 to 55 pm in width. Seasonal changes in the vegetative population and in sedimentation of the newly formed cysts were investigated in situ in both bays. Planktonic vegetative cells peaked in autumn (December) in Onagawa Bay and in spring (April) in Masan Bay, when water temperature was ca. 15 degrees C, In contrast, the cells were not detected in either bay in summer. Mass encystment. occurred in March in Onagawa Bay and in November in Masan Bay without coincidence with the peaks in vegetative populations at either locality. These results indicate that S. capitatum is adapted to low and moderate temperatures and aestivates during warm summer.

Mallard survival, movements, and habitat use during autumn in Illinois	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The Illinois River Valley (IRV) in central Illinois, USA, provides migratory stopover habitat for millions of waterfowl during autumn and spring in the Mississippi Flyway. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are the most abundant species of waterfowl during autumn migration and the most harvested duck in Illinois. We investigated mallard migration ecology in central Illinois, USA, to address information needs of biologists and managers in the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lake Region Joint Venture and Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Our objectives were to document daily movements and identify factors affecting inter-wetland movements, investigate lengths of foraging flights, assess home range size during stopover, describe habitat use and identify factors associated with wetland use, estimate survival and cause specific mortality, and evaluate proportional use of refuges and areas open to hunting in and nearby the IRV by mallards. We employed standard radio-telemetry techniques to achieve our objectives during autumns and early winters 2009 and 2010 (n=86 F and 56M mallards). The mean movement distance between locations collected on consecutive days was 2,822120 (SE) m (n=1,862; max.=56,966m) across age, sex, and months. Female mallards (n=35) traveled 2,708 +/- 191m during evening foraging flights (n=145) to agricultural fields and emergent marshes. Mean home range size (95% minimum convex polygon) was 21,306 +/- 1,925ha across sex and age classes (n=81 mallards). We documented 43 mortalities of 142 radio-marked mallards (2009: 28.2%; 2010: 32.3%) with 85.0% and 69.6% of deaths attributed to hunting in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Body condition, hunting period, age, year, minimum daily temperature, and daily movement distance were important variables affecting survival, but differences were most pronounced for year and hunting period. Overall survival was greater in 2010 (S-i=0.62) than 2009 (S-i=0.39) and daily survival rates were 0.8% and 0.4% greater during closed than open hunting periods in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Mallards used open water most frequently across years (49.4% daily locations), followed by corn (dryland, flooded, standing, or harvested; 16.3%), herbaceous (10.6%), woody (10.5%), and other wetlands and upland cover types. Use of areas closed to hunting was low (18.7%) and most diurnal locations of mallards occurred in wetlands open to hunting (81.3%; i.e., not designated as refuge by statute). Similar to diurnal habitat use, female mallards returning from evening foraging flights (n=138) used areas open to hunting (81.9%) more than refuges (18.1%). Refuges that were primarily composed of open water received low use by autumn-migrating mallards in the IRV. Restoration or rehabilitation of moist-soil and emergent wetlands within statutory refuges protected from unnatural flood regimes may improve foraging habitat quality and increase survival for mallards and other ducks during migration. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society. We recommend acquisition of additional statutory refuges in locations where management for moist-soil, emergent, and aquatic vegetation communities is feasible to increase autumn survival of mallards in central Illinois. Restoration or rehabilitation of moist-soil and emergent wetlands and statutory refuges in areas protected from unnatural flood regimes or adjacent to the Illinois River floodplain may improve foraging habitat quality, reduce daily movement distances, and increase survival for mallards and other ducks during autumn migration.

The relationship between phytoplankton community structure and environmental factors including hydrological, meteorological, physical, and chemical variables were explored using multivariate analysis. A total of 81 taxa of phytoplankton were identified, which were mainly composed of chlorophyta, bacillariophyta, and cyanobacteria. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Pseudanabaena limnetica during summer and fall and by Cyclotella meneghiniana during winter and spring. The abundance of phytoplankton ranged from 0.24x10(4) cells/L to 33.45x10(6) cells/L, with the minimum occurring during February 2010 and the maximum during July 2009. The phytoplankton community was dominated mainly by cyanobacteria from April to September, and by bacillariophyta and pyrrophyta from October to March. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that temperature, pH values, and orthophosphate were the most important driving factors regulating the composition and dynamics of the phytoplankton community in the estuary. Cyanobacteria and euglenophyta abundance and biomass were affected mainly by temperature and pH values, while most chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were influenced by the concentrations of nutrients.

The model has a terrain following (sigma) vertical coordinate and the Mellor-Yamada turbulence closure scheme. This two-year period was chosen because of an extensive set of observational data including surface temperature observations at permanent buoys and current and temperature observations from subsurface moorings. The emphasis of this paper is on the large-scale seasonal variations of thermal structure and circulation in Lake Michigan. The hydrodynamic model of Lake Michigan has 20 vertical levels and a uniform horizontal grid size of 5 km. The model is driven with surface fluxes of heat and momentum derived from observed meteorological conditions at eight land stations and two buoys from April 1982 to November 1983. The model was able to reproduce all of the basic features of the thermal structure in Lake Michigan: spring thermal front, full stratification, deepening of the thermocline during the fall cooling, and finally an overturn in the late fall. The largest currents occur in the fall and winter when temperature gradients are lowest and winds strongest. Large-scale circulation patterns tend to be cyclonic (counterclockwise), with cyclonic circulation within each subbasin. All these facts are in agreement with observations.

The number of white birds (i.e. adults and yearlings) in the Greater Yellowstone Area (473) was 8.2% higher than the 437 recorded in 2021, but the total number of grey birds (cygnets) decreased by 8.8%, from 91 in 2021 to 83 in 2022. There was some regional variation in breeding success. The cygnet count decreased by 74.1% in Montana (where only seven cygnets fledged; the lowest number recorded since 2008) and cygnet production in Wyoming also decreased, by 17.0%, but conversely it increased by 191% in Idaho. In Oregon, 27 white birds were observed at the Summer Lake Wildlife Management Area (WMA) and vicinity (a 10% decrease on last year's count of 30), and two white birds were observed at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). There were no white birds recorded at Ruby Lake NWR, Nevada. Precipitation throughout most of the Greater Yellowstone Area was 40%-80% of normal during winter 2021-2022. During the summer months, temperatures were within the normal average whereas precipitation was 75-130% of normal, especially during June-August. Palmer Drought Indices for areas within the Greater Yellowstone area also suggested wetter conditions for 2022 in comparison with 2021. The 2022 survey results are described in relation to longer-term monitoring of the U.S. Breeding Segment of the RMP, which found no evidence for a trend in total numbers over the period 2015-2021, but a decrease in the proportion of cygnets recorded during this time.																			0954-6324	2052-6458					2024					7		76	88																WOS:001445333100004

This study evaluated the spatial and temporal variation in gill-net C/f and length structure of captured salmonids in nearshore (<= 7.6-m bottom depth) and offshore (> 7.6-m bottom depth) areas of two Wyoming reservoirs. Floating experimental gill nets were set as nearshore and offshore pairs at 24 locations in both reservoirs during each of four sampling periods (spring, early summer, late Summer, and fall). Salmonid Clf was significantly higher in nearshore areas than in offshore areas during all periods in one reservoir and during all periods except spring in the other reservoir. Mean Clf of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss wits not significantly different between nearshore and offshore areas when water temperatures were 10-13 degrees C in both reservoirs. Length Structure of salmonids differed Significantly between nearshore and offshore locations and among periods in both reservoirs. These patterns should be considered in both the design and analysis phases of monitoring efforts that use floating experimental gill nets and other sampling gears.																			0275-5947					NOV	2005	25	4					1301	1309		10.1577/M04-140.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-140.1													WOS:000234015800011

However, national-scale studies of reservoir phytoplankton PP in China remain limited, typically subsumed within lake research, hindering mechanistic understanding of large-scale PP variations. To address this gap, we compiled a database of phytoplankton PP in Chinese reservoirs (1980-2023) based on an exhaustive literature review, incorporating only data measured using the light-dark bottle method. Utilizing this database, this study quantifies phytoplankton PP and carbon sequestration potential across 165 Chinese reservoirs. The result showed that phytoplankton PP ranged 0.13-10.22 g O-2<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1), with significantly higher values in the Yellow River (YR), Songhua River and Liaohe River (S/LR), and Haihe and Huaihe River (H/HR) basins versus the Pearl River (PR), Northwest Internal Rivers (NIR), and Southwest Rivers (SWR) basins. Temporally, phytoplankton PP peaked in the 1990s, declined thereafter, but rebounded in the 2020s (decadal sequence: 1990s > 2020s > 2000s > 1980s > 2010s). Seasonal variation followed summer > spring > autumn > winter. Sunshine hours, water depth, and rainfall emerged as dominant phytoplankton PP drivers. National phytoplankton PP extrapolation reached 22.08 Tg & sdot;O-2 & sdot;a(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g), equivalent to 6.62 Tg carbon sequestration capacity. Our analysis delineates spatio-temporal patterns of phytoplankton PP in Chinese reservoirs and underscores its significance for regional carbon budgets and aquatic ecosystem dynamics.

S	Hand, MS; Lawson, M		Halofsky, JE; Peterson, DL		Hand, Michael S.; Lawson, Megan			Effects of Climate Change on Recreation in the Northern Rockies	CLIMATE CHANGE AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN ECOSYSTEMS	Advances in Global Change Research											Recreation has a significant economic impact throughout the Northern Rockies. A warmer climate will generally improve opportunities for warm-weather activities (hiking, camping, sightseeing) because it will create a longer time during which these activities are possible, especially in the spring and autumn "shoulder seasons." However, it will reduce opportunities for snow-based, winter activities (downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling) because snowpack is expected to decline significantly in the future. Recreationists will probably engage in more water-based activities in lakes and rivers in order to seek refuge from hotter summer weather. Higher temperatures may have both positive and negative effects on wildlife-based activities (hunting, fishing, birding) and gathering of forest products (e.g., berries, mushrooms), depending on how target habitats and species are affected. Recreationists are expected to be highly adaptable to a warmer climate by shifting to different activities and different locations, behavior that is already observed from year to year. For example, downhill skiers may switch to ski areas that have more reliable snow, cross-country skiers will travel to higher elevations, and larger ski areas on federal lands may expand to multi-season operation. Water-based recreationists may adapt to climate change by choosing different sites that are less susceptible to changes in water levels. Hunters may need to adapt by altering the timing and location of hunts. Federal management of recreation is currently not very flexible with respect to altered temporal and spatial patterns of recreation. This can be at least partially resolved by assessing expected use patterns in a warmer climate, modifying opening times of facilities, and deploying seasonal employees responsible for recreational facilities earlier in the year.																			1574-0919		978-3-319-56928-4; 978-3-319-56927-7				2018	63						169	188		10.1007/978-3-319-56928-4_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56928-4_9	10.1007/978-3-319-56928-4												WOS:000439510600011

Seasonal patterns in bycatch composition and mortality associated with a freshwater hoop net fishery	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												Although bycatch is well known and well studied in marine fisheries, comparatively little is known about bycatch in freshwater fisheries. Even basic information on bycatch composition and mortality in freshwater is unavailable, given that few inland jurisdictions require reporting of bycatch. A small-scale inland hoop net fishery that targets pan fish (e.g. sunfish, Lepomis spp.) and operates primarily in the spring and fall was simulated in two lakes in south-eastern Ontario to characterize both bycatch composition and mortality. We fished one lake in both spring and fall to compare catch rates, while in the other lake we set nets for 2 or 6 days during the spring to assess fish mortality associated with different net tending frequencies. In both lakes, bycatch consisted of gamefish, turtles (including several species at risk), and mammals. For fish, there was no difference in spring and fall catches. Turtles, however, were captured more often in spring. Fish mortality of both target and non-target species increased from 0.30.9% to 3.03.7% (410 times) when set net duration increased from 2 to 6 days. Despite the provision of an air breathing space in our nets, we documented severe turtle mortality (33% in one lake) and all mammals died, suggesting that provision of air spaces is not always effective. Although all bycatch mortality is a concern, turtles are prone to population declines even with low levels of non-natural mortality. As such, regulators may consider limiting commercial fishing to the fall in this region to reduce turtle captures. Seasonal restrictions on fishing or use of frequent net tending (e.g. <?2 days) will not prevent all turtle bycatch and therefore gear modifications should be investigated to further reduce turtle captures and mortality associated with hoop nets.					; Haxton, Tim/H-7857-2019; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Blouin-Demers, Gabriel/GRS-0626-2022	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Haxton, Tim/0000-0002-9767-3986; 													1367-9430					FEB	2012	15	1					53	60		10.1111/j.1469-1795.2011.00487.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2011.00487.x													WOS:000300664800009
J	Shi, J; Hu, CM				Shi, Jing; Hu, Chuanmin			Evaluation of ECOSTRESS Thermal Data over South Florida Estuaries	SENSORS												Operational coarse-resolution satellite thermal sensors designed for global oceans are often insufficient for evaluating surface temperature of small water bodies. Here, the quality of the thermal data, collected by the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), over several South Florida estuaries, Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Okeechobee is evaluated using both in situ and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. Overall, for SST between similar to 6 and similar to 32 degrees C, ECOSTRESS LST (Land Surface Temperature, used as a surrogate for SST in this study) appears to be slightly underestimated, with the underestimation being more severe at night (-1.13 degrees C) than during the day (-0.64 degrees C), in spring and summer (-1.25 +/- 1.39 degrees C) than in autumn and winter (-0.57 +/- 0.98 degrees C), and after May 2019 when two of the five bands failed. The root-mean-square uncertainties of ECOSTRESS SST are generally within 1-2 degrees C. Spatial analysis further suggests that ECOSTRESS SST covers waters closer to shore and reveals more spatial features than MODIS, with comparable image noise. From these observations, after proper georeferencing and empirical correction of the negative bias, ECOSTRESS SST may be used to evaluate the thermal environments of small water bodies, thus filling gaps in the coarse-resolution satellite data.					hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012	Hu, Chuanmin/0000-0003-3949-6560														1424-8220				JUL	2021	21	13							4341	10.3390/s21134341	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21134341								34201965					WOS:000672003300001

As part of the Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity program at the University of Detroit Mercy, a CURE metagenomics course was established in the winter of 2019. Students investigated the bacterial community composition in a eutrophic cove in Lake Saint Clair (Harrison Township, MI, United States) from water samples taken in the summer and winter. The students created 16S rRNA libraries that were sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. They used a public web-based supercomputing resource to process their raw sequencing data and web-based tools to perform advanced statistical analysis. The students discovered that the most common operational taxonomic unit, representing 31% of the prokaryotic sequences in both summer and winter samples, corresponded to an organism that belongs to a previously unidentified phylum. This result showed the students the power of metagenomics because the approach was able to detect unclassified organisms. Principal Coordinates Analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index data showed that the winter community was distinct from the summer community [Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) r = 0.59829, n = 18, and p < 0.001]. Dendrograms based on hierarchically clustered Pearson correlation coefficients of phyla were divided into a winter clade and a summer clade. The conclusion is that the winter bacterial population was fundamentally different from the summer population, even though the samples were taken from the same locations in a protected cove. Because of the small class sizes, qualitative as well as statistical methods were used to evaluate the course's impact on student attitudes. Results from the Laboratory Course Assessment Survey showed that most of the respondents felt they were contributing to scientific knowledge and the course fostered student collaboration. The majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the course incorporated iteration aspects of scientific investigations, such as repeating procedures to fix problems. In summary, the metagenomics CURE course was able to add to scientific knowledge and allowed students to participate in authentic research.																				1664-302X				FEB 18	2021	12								579325	10.3389/fmicb.2021.579325	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.579325								33679627					WOS:000624926400001
J	Hart, RC				Hart, RC			On the limnology of Spioenkop, a turbid reservoir on the upper Thukela River, with particular reference to the structure and dynamics of its plankton community	WATER SA												Basic Features of the physical and biological limnology of Spioenkop, a large turbid impoundment on the Thukela River, were studied between July 1989 and May 1990, following surveys in spring 1987 and 1988. The lake showed a typical monomictic pattern of summer stratification (November through April) and holomictic winter circulation (May to October). Water quality was chemically good, with little evidence of nutrient enrichment (South African DWAF records). Biological production was confined by high turbidity (SD around 25 cm, NTU values of ca 90) imposed by suspended sediments, limiting annual maximum surface chlorophyll content to below 5 mu g.l(-1), and spring primary production to < 500 mg C.m(-2).d(-1). Zooplankton was dominated (numerically and/or gravimetrically) by typical turbid-water fauna; the copepods Metadiaptomus colonialis and Lovenula falcifera, and cladocerans Daphnia barbata and Moina micrura. These species and other tai;a present showed considerable seasonal periodicity, but maximal total abundance of the entire community (680 mg.mg(-2) DW) was attained in mid-summer. Limited information regarding littoral zoobenthos and fish is provided. Considerations of Spioenkop as a mirror of its catchment, and in relation to the major Thukela-Vaal inter-basin transfer scheme invite critical appraisal of the level of scientific knowledge and understanding. The plea and challenge is made for more holistic and integrated approaches to ensure sustainable environmental management.																			0378-4738					OCT	1999	25	4					519	528																WOS:000083534900015
J	Devetter, M				Devetter, Miloslav			Seasonal development of planktonic rotifers in Slapy Reservoir (Czech Republic)	BIOLOGIA												The rotifer community of the canyon shaped Slapy Reservoir was studied over four years, from 2000 to 2003. A total of 38 rotifer taxa were identified in the pelagial zone. The dominant species, Keratella cochlearis, K. quadrata, Polyarthra dolichoptera, P. vulgaris, Synchaeta lakowitziana and Pompholyx sulcata, were similar to other reservoirs in the same area. Tychoplanktic species, which are typical for communities of upstream reservoirs, are reduced in the Slapy Reservoir. The seasonal fluctuation of rotifer abundance is characterized by a significant spring peak, clear water depression, summer peak and sometimes a lower peak in autumn. Fluctuation of the rotifer species shows a highly unified trend through the years with very low variation through the years. It results from the input of hypolimnetic water from an upstream reservoir, which erased a large part of the effect of year to year climatic fluctuations.

A third group, inhabiting the 7 hydro-electric reservoirs of the Waikato system, average both low gill raker (c. 21) and low vertebrae numbers (c. 52). Reservoir smelt have approximately 2 fewer first arch gill rakers than Lake Taupo fish. Most diadromous smelt mature in late summer and autumn, whereas reservoir fish mature in spring and early summer. Reservoir and Lake Taupo smelt have smaller eggs and larvae than diadromous smelt. The larger diadromous larvae have larger yolk sacs than Lake Taupo larvae; this is probably an adaptation associated with a direct larval migration to sea. Reservoir and lacustrine post-larvae were found in the lower Waikato River but diadromous post-larvae were confined to the estuary and sea. Reservoir populations probably originated from fish displaced down stream from Lake Taupo.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1989	23	3					345	355		10.1080/00288330.1989.9516371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1989.9516371													WOS:A1989AZ98400005

Gas properties of winter lake ice in Northern Sweden: implication for carbon gas release	BIOGEOSCIENCES												This paper describes gas composition, total gas content and bubbles characteristics in winter lake ice for four adjacent lakes in a discontinuous permafrost area. Our gas mixing ratios for O-2, N-2, CO2, and CH4 suggest that gas exchange occurs between the bubbles and the water before entrapment in the ice. Comparison between lakes enabled us to identify 2 major "bubbling events" shown to be related to a regional drop of atmospheric pressure. Further comparison demonstrates that winter lake gas content is strongly dependent on hydrological connections: according to their closed/open status with regards to water exchange, lakes build up more or less greenhouse gases (GHG) in their water and ice cover during the winter, and release it during spring melt. These discrepancies between lakes need to be taken into account when establishing a budget for permafrost regions. Our analysis allows us to present a new classification of bubbles, according to their gas properties. Our methane emission budgets (from 6.52 10(-5) to 12.7 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) at 4 different lakes) for the three months of winter ice cover is complementary to other budget estimates, as our approach encompasses inter-and intra-lake variability. Most available studies on boreal lakes have focused on quantifying GHG emissions from sediment by means of various systems collecting gases at the lake surface, and this mainly during the summer "open water" period. Only few of these have looked at the gas enclosed in the winter ice-cover itself. Our approach enables us to integrate, for the first time, the history of winter gas emission for this type of lakes.																			1726-4170	1726-4189					2012	9	2					827	838		10.5194/bg-9-827-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-9-827-2012													WOS:000300877400015

Short winters threaten temperate fish populations	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Although climate warming is expected to benefit temperate ectotherms by lengthening the summer growing season, declines in reproductive success following short, warm winters may counter such positive effects. Here we present long-term (1973-2010) field patterns for Lake Erie yellow perch, Perca flavescens, which show that failed annual recruitment events followed short, warm winters. Subsequent laboratory experimentation and field investigations revealed how reduced reproductive success following short, warm winters underlie these observed field patterns. Following short winters, females spawn at warmer temperatures and produce smaller eggs that both hatch at lower rates and produce smaller larvae than females exposed to long winters. Our research suggests that continued climate warming can lead to unanticipated, negative effects on temperate fish populations.

J	Wang, CL; Xv, YH; Li, SY; Li, X				Wang, Chunlin; Xv, Yuhan; Li, Siyue; Li, Xing			Interconnected River-Lake Project Decreased CO2 and CH4 Emission from Urban Rivers	WATER												Urban riverine networks are hotspots of CO2 and CH4 emissions, due to river impoundment and pollution. The river-lake connection is considered to be an important way to improve the ecological environment of urban rivers; however, its impact on CO2 and CH4 emissions from urban rivers and regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. Rivers and lakes have been studied separately by lots of traditional studies. In this study, we investigated the concentration and emission of CO2 and CH4 from March 2021 to December 2021 in an interconnected river-lake system in Central China. We found that the urban river-lake system was a hotspot of CO2 and CH4 emissions. CO2 and CH4 emissions from urban rivers were much higher than those from the lakes, which are 2.7 times and 11.9 times that of lakes, respectively. The correlation analysis indicated that the spatial variation of CO2 and CH4 emissions was determined by nutrient content. The abundant nutrients promoted microbial growth and consumed dissolved oxygen (DO), thus resulting in high emissions of CO2 and CH4 in the isolated urban rivers (UR). The average CO2 and CH4 emissions of urban rivers are 991.56 and 14.82 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The river-lake connection decreased the nutrients of urban rivers connected to lakes (LUR). The moderate nutrients wreaked in situ respiration, exhibiting moderate CO2 emission in the LUR. The average CO2 emission of LUR is 543.49 mmol m(-2) d(-1). The river-lake connection increased the DO concentrations in the LUR, inhibited methanogenesis, and enhanced CH4 oxidation, reducing CH4 emission from LUR sharply. The average CH4 emission of LUR is 1.26 mmol m(-2) d(-1). A correlation analysis showed that the seasonal variations of CO2 and CH4 emissions were controlled by DO and T. Hence, the highest emissions of CO2 were observed in the spring and the lowest in the winter, and the CO2 emissions in spring were 10.7 times that in winter. The highest emissions of CH4 were observed in the summer and the lowest in the winter, and the CH4 emissions in summer were 6.6 times those in winter. The connection of urban rivers and lakes changes the environmental factors, thereby varying the production and emission of greenhouse gases. This study advanced the knowledge of the greenhouse gas emission response to the river-lake connection, providing the theoretical basis for greenhouse gas emission reduction from urban rivers.					xing, li/HHN-4346-2022; Li, Siyue/E-8297-2012	Li, Siyue/0000-0002-3097-6819														2073-4441				MAY 24	2023	15	11							1986	10.3390/w15111986	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15111986													WOS:001004649800001

Its water body covers 2338 km(2), and water depth varies between 2 and 4 meters. To monitor water quality in such a large lake, TM is probably the best remote sensing data due to its spatial resolution. While some modeling works have been done on relationships between total suspended sediment concentration (SS) and reflectance in TM image, the TM bands being used in the model are still under discussion. In this paper, a model was developed on relationships between SS and ETM in summer and winter in Taihu Lake. ETM image is geo-referenced with 1:50,000 topographic map and digital number of pixel is converted to planetary reflectance. An index called NDSS from ETM image is introduced, where NDSS= (B3-B1)/(B3+B1). The ETM monitoring model of SS in summer and winter was built through regression analysis. The basic model form is SS=f(NDSS), goodness-of-fit statistics R-2 is from 0.51 to 0.72, and the model is significant under p=0.005. Obvious difference exists between the summer model and winter model. In the summer model, spatial variation of water body must be considered due to the dynamic water environment. The same variation, however, can be ignored in winter model.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	0-8194-6255-1				2006	6199								619902	10.1117/12.673651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.673651													WOS:000236544500002

Sources of nitrogen to stream food webs in tributaries of the Red River Valley, Manitoba	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Winnipeg has undergone rapid eutrophication over the last several decades with a large portion of the associated nutrient loads delivered via the Red River. Consequently, subcatchments of the Red River Valley (RRV) are priorities for nutrient management, an aim that requires identification of key nutrient sources to stream food webs. We identified the primary sources of nitrogen to food webs of rural streams of the RRV, as well as variation in nitrogen input between spring and summer. We measured 815N of particulate organic matter (POM) and collector-gatherer invertebrates collected in spring and summer from 20 subcatchments, which exhibited a range of agricultural intensity and size of municipal wastewater lagoons. 815N values of POM and collector-gatherer invertebrates were best predicted by the presence of wastewater treatment lagoons, with 815N values increasing with the number of people served by lagoons in spring and summer. When present, wastewater contributed a greater proportion of nitrogen to stream food webs than agricultural sources. Waste sources also had a greater relative contribution to food webs in summer than spring. Despite wastewater lagoons releasing nitrogen in short-term, pulsed discharges, the influence of wastewater on food web nitrogen persisted from the summer release into the following spring. Based on the observed importance of wastewater as a source of nitrogen to stream food webs, we recommend management agencies consider additional actions to reduce nutrient losses from wastewater treatment facilities as well as agricultural lands to more effectively protect aquatic ecosystems.

J	Rose, NL; Munthe, J; McCartney, A				Rose, Neil L.; Munthe, John; McCartney, Alistair			Winter peaks of methylmercury in deposition to a remote Scottish mountain lake	CHEMOSPHERE												Depositional records of methylmercury (MeHg) are rare, especially for remote and mountainous areas. Our data from Lochnagar, a mountain lake in Scotland, covering a 7-year period from 2001-2008, show an unusual seasonal pattern in that elevated MeNg concentrations occur each winter while concentrations each summer fall below the limit of detection. To our knowledge this is the first time this seasonal pattern has been reported. Peak concentrations at the site in October 2006 (1.2 ng L-1) are amongst the highest reported depositional values in the literature. As the soils and lakes in the region are frozen or snow covered for much of each winter, we consider possible sources of this winter deposited MeHg to be either aqueous phase methylation in the atmosphere or marine evasion. However, the factor driving this seasonal pattern is likely to be scavenging by snow, as elevated concentrations in deposition coincide with periods of snowfall at the site. If this mechanism is correct, then predicted impacts of climate change, which will reduce annual snowfall at the site by between 50% and 100% by 2080, will effectively eliminate this input source. However, other climate-influenced inputs of mercury, such as remobilisation from catchment soils, are likely to increase and negate any benefit. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Human-driven changes affect nutrient inputs, oxygen solubility, and the hydrodynamics of lakes, which affect biogeochemical cycles mediated by microbial communities. However, information on the succession of microbes involved in nitrogen cycling in seasonally stratified lakes is still incomplete. Here, we investigated the succession of nitrogen-transforming microorganisms in Lake Vechten over a period of 19 months, combining 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantification of functional genes. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and anammox bacteria were abundant in the sediment during winter, accompanied by nitrate in the water column. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria emerged in the water column in spring when nitrate was gradually depleted. Denitrifying bacteria containing nirS genes were exclusively present in the anoxic hypolimnion. During summer stratification, abundances of AOA, AOB, and anammox bacteria decreased sharply in the sediment, and ammonium accumulated in hypolimnion. After lake mixing during fall turnover, abundances of AOA, AOB, and anammox bacteria increased and ammonium was oxidized to nitrate. Hence, nitrogen-transforming microorganisms in Lake Vechten displayed a pronounced seasonal succession, which was strongly determined by the seasonal stratification pattern. These results imply that changes in stratification and vertical mixing induced by global warming are likely to alter the nitrogen cycle of seasonally stratified lakes.

Henriikka; Preskienis, Vilmantas; Gaudreault, Noemie; Girard, Catherine; Rautio, Milla			Variability in lake bacterial growth and primary production under lake ice: Evidence from early winter to spring melt	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate change is causing seasonally ice-covered lakes of the boreal region to undergo changes in their winter regime by altering patterns of precipitation and temperature, often reflected as reduced snow and ice cover duration. The duration, extent and quality of ice, and snow cover have a pivotal role for production and carbon cycling in lakes in winter, with potentially cascading effects for the following open water period. We investigated under-ice carbon cycling by assessing bacterial growth (including bacterial production, bacterial respiration, and bacterial growth efficiency) and primary production at five water depths during early winter, midwinter, late winter and melting season in a boreal lake, and report significantly different temporal patterns. Bacterial respiration was dominant in early and midwinter, whereas the late winter and melting season were dominated by bacterial production. Multiple linear regression models indicated that high early winter bacterial respiration was associated with senescing phytoplankton, whereas bacterial production was promoted by the onset of spring processes. Collectively, bacterial growth indices were inherently linked with bacterioplankton community composition and specific biomarker taxa. Primary production under ice increased in late winter when light-blocking snow cover melted, and primary production measured from the lake ice exceeded that of the water column at the melting season. Ice samples hosted diverse eukaryotic communities including photoautotrophs, suggesting that the habitat potential of the understudied lake ice and the role of ice for ecological processes at ice melt should be further explored.					; Prėskienis, Vilmantas/G-1630-2014	Gaudreault, Noemie/0000-0001-9370-790X; Preskienis, Vilmantas/0000-0002-8176-2263; Rautio, Milla/0000-0002-2375-9082; Kivila, E.

K.; Kosonen, Emilia; Weckstrom, Jan			Seasonality of chrysophyte cyst and diatom assemblages in varved Lake Nautajarvi - implications for palaeolimnological studies	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Phytoplankton species composition is strongly affected by seasons, which should be taken into account in palaeolimnological studies. Although chrysophyte cysts and diatoms are widely used as palaeobioindicators in palaeolimnological studies, only recently have attempts been made to use their modern deposition from sediment trap data to provide more detailed, seasonal-based environmental reconstructions. In this study sediment traps were used to record seasonality of chrysophyte cysts and diatoms during two climatically different years 2009 and 2010 in an annually laminated Lake Nautajarvi, Finland, and this seasonal data was then compared with the fossil record derived from the surface sediment of the lake. The overall changes in cyst and diatom assemblages between years and seasons are subtle. For both groups, no clear connection to any particular season could be detected in the sediment surface. Despite the climatological differences between the study years, the inter-annual accumulation rates of both algal groups were surprisingly similar, whereas the intra-annual accumulation rates differed substantially. This and the high amount of taxa occurring during all seasons in the trap samples implies that primary producers are more dependent on prevailing seasonal limnological conditions than on rapid, shortly lived episodes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that chrysophyte cyst assemblages from the spring sediment trap are mainly controlled by the spring discharge intensity, a surrogate variable of spring weather conditions, whereas precipitation and air temperature have the strongest impact on the summer assemblages. However, only discharge explains statistically significantly the variance in the cyst data. Precipitation and air temperature have the strongest impact on the diatom summer samples, whereas the spring sediment trap sample of the snowy and harsh winter of 2010 was strongly correlated with the spring discharge. However, none of the measured environmental variables explains the variance in the diatom data statistically significantly. The similarity between the algae found in the sediment traps and surface sediment sample suggests that within small and shallow lakes without any extreme environmental settings the surface sediment sample represents well the lake's overall algal composition and can thus be used in palaeolimnological studies.

Winter to spring changes in the slush bacterial community composition of a high-mountain lake (Lake Redon, Pyrenees)	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Bacterial community composition was analysed in the slush layers of snow-covered Lake Redon (2240 m altitude, Limnological Observatory of the Pyrenees, LOOP, NE Spain) in winter and spring and compared with bacteria from the lake water column, using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and CARD-FISH counts. The set of biological data was related to changes in bacterial production and to other relevant environmental variables measured in situ. In winter, up to 70% of the 16S rRNA sequences found in the slush were closely related to planktonic bacteria from the water column beneath the ice. Conversely, during spring ablation, 50% of the sequences had > 97% identity with bacteria from the cryosphere (i.e. globally distributed glaciers, snow and ice) and may have originated from remote aerosol deposition. The transition winter to spring was characterized by consistent community changes switching from assemblages dominated by Beta-proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes during snowpack growth to communities essentially dominated by the Bacteroidetes of classes Cytophagia and Sphingobacteria. This strong bacterial composition switch was associated with consistent increases in bacterial abundance and production, and decreasing bacterial diversity.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Point bar areas around lakes can provide ecological service functions. For example, plants growing on point bars absorb and remove nutrients from the soil and water. However, if the point-bar plants are unregulated, in the fall and winter, plant debris will decompose, releasing nutrients that then enter the water body and cause eutrophication. Therefore, any harvesting should be managed. But how to harvest plants and how often to harvest them, and there is little research on these. In this study, the point bar at Qingcaosha Reservoir was used to study the effects of three plant harvesting modes (M1: unharvested; M2: one harvest in the fall; and M3: one harvest in summer and one in the fall) on the removal of nitrogen (N) from point-bar soil. The largest amount of N was removed by the plants when the M3 mode was used (26.93 g/m(2)). However, the M2 mode removed the most N from the soil during the plant growth season (81.62 g/m(2)), which implied that the nitrification and denitrification effects of soil microorganisms make the largest contribution to N removal from this point-bar soil. The nitrification and denitrification activity of microorganisms was higher for M2 than for M1 and M3 in the following year. Additionally, summer harvesting (M3) had a negative effect on nitrification efficiency in the current season because anaerobic bacteria in the soil significantly increased and nitrifying bacteria significantly decreased after harvesting. However, after a period of recovery, the number of microbial nitrifiers increased again and nitrification activity rose in the following year. The reduction in oxygen supply after harvesting may be the main reason for low nitrification in the current season, but it was beneficial to nitrification and denitrification in the following year because there was luxuriant plant growth. Therefore, when considering both the current season and the following year, harvesting should not be too frequent and one harvest in the fall (M2) led to the largest removal of N from the soil.

Wild birds are also detected to carry H5N1 over long distances and are able to introduce it into new areas during migration. In this article, our objective is to provide lists of bird species potentially involved in the introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in Qinghai Lake, which is an important breeding and stopover site for aquatic birds along the Central Asian Flyway. Bird species were classified according to the following behavioral and ecological factors: migratory status, abundance, degree of mixing species and gregariousness, and the prevalence rate of H5N1 virus. Most of the high-risk species were from the family Anatidae, order Anseriformes (9/14 in spring, 11/15 in fall). We also estimated the relative risk of bird species involved by using a semi-quantitative method; species from family Anatidae accounted for over 39% and over 91% of the total risk at spring and fall migration periods, respectively. Results also show the relative risk for each bird aggregating site in helping to identify high-risk areas. This work may also be instructive and meaningful to the avian influenza surveillance in the breeding, stopover, and wintering sites besides Qinghai Lake along the Central Asian Flyway.																			1530-3667	1557-7759				MAY	2011	11	5					567	576		10.1089/vbz.2009.0240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2009.0240								20925522					WOS:000290717000014
J	Iqbal, J; Shah, MH; Akhter, G				Iqbal, Javed; Shah, Munir H.; Akhter, Gulraiz			Characterization, source apportionment and health risk assessment of trace metals in freshwater Rawal Lake, Pakistan	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Water quality of freshwater reservoirs in Pakistan is being degraded because of excessive anthropogenic activities. There is a dire need for appropriate water quality monitoring and evaluation of related health risks to humans. The distribution of trace metals (Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Sr and Zn) was evaluated in the surface water of Rawal Lake, Pakistan by atomic absorption spectrometry along with the physicochemical parameters during summer and winter. Multivariate methods were used for identification and apportionment of the pollution sources in the lake. Non-carcinogenic health risk assessment was computed to assess the adverse health effects on the population. During summer, average metal levels in the water samples exhibited decreasing concentration order: Na > Ca > Mg > K > Sr > Pb > Fe > Zn > Co > Cu > Cr > Cd = Li > Mn, while during winter, the order was: Ca > Na > Mg > K > Sr > Pb > Co > Cr > Fe > Cd > Zn > Cu > Mn > Li. Among the metals, measured levels of Cd and Pb during summer and winter, while that of Co and Cr during winter were found to be higher than the guideline values. Multivariate PCA and CA revealed significant anthropogenic contributions of the metals in lake water. The hazard quotients (via ingestion) of Cd and Pb during summer as well as in winter, whereas, that of Cr and Co during winter were found to be higher than the safe limits, posing threat to the consumers. However, no risk related to the dermal contact was associated with the measured metal levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of arsenic, selenium, tin and mercury in water and sediments of Bitter Lakes, Suez Canal, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												Surface water and surface sediment samples were collected from Bitter Lakes from winter to autumn 2018 to evaluate the impact of land-based activities on the distribution of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), tin (Sn), and mercury (Hg). The metal concentrations were measured in 12 sampling sites along Bitter Lakes in the Suez Canal by the hydride system MH10 coupled with an atomic absorption spectropho-tometer. The most industrialized regions in the lake showed elevated levels of metals in the water and sediments compared to other studied areas. As, Sn, and Hg showed the highest levels in water during winter (9.66, 1.03, and 0.25 lg/l, respectively), while Se recorded its highest values during summer (2.60 lg/L). Similarly, the highest total concentrations of the investigated elements in the sediments were 22400.00, 605.85, 40.91, and 446.55 ng/g, respectively.& COPY; 2023 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.
