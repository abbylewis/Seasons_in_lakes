A new urban area exists in the basin and sewerage works were constructed in the early 1990s, so contaminated water with a bad odour had flowed into the brook before the sewerage works. To reduce the smell, the river mouth was excavated to narrow the channel in the early 1980s. Thus, river-bed sediment after this excavation only occurs at the river mouth. From the upper 24 cm of a sediment core, we found 19 strata of leaves which were supplied from deciduous trees in autumn. We also found several gravel layers which were supplied from the lake during severe storms. The combination of veins and gravel layers were reconstructed for about 20 years of sediment records with an error of two to three years.

Water parameters of Pulang Lupa Lake, an abandoned open pit mine in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines and its potential as bird watching destination	PALAWAN SCIENTIST												Abandoned open pit mines when properly managed can be an important settlement and eco-tourism sites. The Pulang Lupa Lake - an abandoned mercury open mining pit in Puerto Princesa City supports a number of settlers and important wildlife. With limited information about its status, this study was conducted to determine the lake's water quality and its potential for eco-tourism. Water physico-chemical parameters were within the permissible limits sets by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for Class C water during the rainy but not in summer season. Water samples for both seasons were positive for total and fecal coliform. The lake serves as important source of fish for informal settlers and the presence of several bird species makes it a potential bird watcher's destination. Information and education campaign among the residents around the lake and strategic environmental plans are needed for its sustainable utilization.

The echo-sounding estimate of density was also compared with catch of trawl per swept area (CSA). All the estimates were highly correlated. Echo-sounding appeared to overestimate the adult vendace population in years of high young-of-the-year vendace abundance and in years of low adult vendace abundance. Echo-sounding was not sufficient to closely monitor the fluctuations of adult vendace density, but when combined with independent indices of population density it could be successfully used in stock density estimation. The relative density index from CPUE was calibrated with the echo-sounding estimates considered least biased. The estimated vendace density varied from 1006 ind./ha in 1984 to 21 ind./ha in 1991. The relative density indices from CPUE and CSA were considered suitable indices for long-term routine monitoring of vendace stocks in a lake.																			0071-1128		3-510-47047-8				1995	46						267	276																WOS:A1995BH14P00032

Freezing of lakes on the Swiss plateau in the period 1901-2006	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Data of ice cover for deep Alpine lakes contain relevant climatological information since ice cover and winter temperature are closely related. For the first time, ice cover data from 11 lakes on the Swiss plateau have been collected and analysed for the period 1901-2006. The ice cover data used stem from systematic registration by individuals or groups (fishermen, an ice club and lake security service) and from several national, regional and local newspapers. It is found that in the past 40 years, and especially during the last two decades, ice cover on Swiss lakes was significantly reduced. This is in good agreement with the observed increase in the winter temperature in this period. The trend of reduced ice cover is more pronounced for lakes that freeze rarely than for the lakes that freeze more frequently. This agrees well with the stronger relative decrease in the probability to exceed the SLIM of negative degree days (NDD) needed for freezing the lakes that rarely freeze. The ice cover data are related with the temperature measurements such as the sum of NDD of nearby official meteorological stations by means of binomial logistic regression. The derived relationships estimate the probability of a complete ice cover on a lake as function of the sum of NDD. The sums of NDD needed are well related to the average depth of the lake (r(NDD-Depth) = 0.85). Diagnosing lake ice cover on the basis of the sum of NDD is much better than a prediction on the basis of a climatological freezing frequency. The variance of lake ice cover that cannot be explained by the sum of NDD is important for judging the uncertainty associated with climate reconstruction on the basis of data on lake ice cover.

For comparison, we also estimated bird density in ROW managed by cutting in New Hampshire and New York and in shrublands managed by fire in the Finger Lakes National Forest (FLNF), New York. On herbicide-managed ROW, we detected a mean of 14.3 individuals and 12.2 species per point count, including many species of early-succession habitat that are declining throughout northeastern United States. Nesting success in forested landscapes of New York, Maine, and Massachusetts was 55% on the ROW, 69% in forests within 20 m of the ROW, and 63% in forests more than 20 m from the ROW. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized 5.3% of the nests and reduced host recruitment by even less. This suggests that ROW in forested areas support high production of shrubland birds and do not exert a measurably harmful effect on forest-nesting birds. Selective herbicide application on ROW sustained shrubland vegetation and supported high densities and high nesting success. Mechanical cutting lowered the structural diversity of vegetation the following spring and was associated with fewer individual birds and species. Cool burns in early spring produced a high structural diversity of herbs, shrubs and trees and supported a high density of birds and bird species. Long-term maintenance of shrublands by burning will require supplemental cutting to remove saplings. As reforestation continues to reduce shrubland habitat, probably below pre-colonial levels, active management for early-succession habitat will be necessary to sustain current population levels of numerous species.

Here we reanalyze existing literature data on the seasonal variation in plankton delta(13)C from eutrophic lakes, and collect new data on mid-summer zooplankton delta(13)C from 52 Canadian Shield lakes, to demonstrate that plankton become enriched in C-13 relative to C-12 under conditions of high productivity and low pCO(2). Low zooplankton delta(13)C signatures in humic/dystrophic lakes of high DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentration and colour, and in clear-water lakes viith high rates of epilimnetic respiration and hypolimnetic metabolism, suggest that the C-13-depletion observed in oligotrophic lakes is probably due to heterotrophic activity.					; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159													0948-3055	1616-1564				JAN 30	1997	12	1					85	93		10.3354/ame012085	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame012085													WOS:A1997WG32000009

An 825-year long varve record from Lillooet Lake, British Columbia, and its potential as a flood proxy	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lillooet River in southwest British Columbia has produced damaging floods many times during the past century. The floods are recorded in Lillooet Lake, into which the river flows, as anomalously thick clastic varves. in order to determine whether an 825-year long varve record obtained from 12 percussion and vibracores can be used as flood proxy, we compare river discharge records dating back to 1914 to the thickness of the varves deposited during the same time period. Correlations between varve thickness and a variety of historical discharge measures are low to moderate for the periods 1914-2004 (r(2) = 0.37) and 1914-1945 (r(2) = 0.40), but higher for the period 1946-2004 (r(2) = 0.55). The best correlation (r(2) = 0.55) is between maximum fall discharge and varve thickness during the most recent period (1946-2004). Varve thickness for the earlier period of hydrometric data (1914-1946), which is a time of rapid glacier retreat and warmer temperatures in British Columbia, is best explained with a discharge proxy combining nival runoff, glacier runoff, and maximum fall discharge. Landslides, glacier fluctuations, river dyking, artificial lowering of Lillooet Lake, as well as lag effects of storms are responsible for the considerable unexplained variance in the relation between discharge measures and varve thickness over the historic period. The cores contain many anomalously thick varves, some of which we attribute to previously dated prehistoric landslides in the watershed or to local landslides into the lake. We conclude that many historic and prehistoric floods are faithfully recorded as anomalously thick clastic varves, but that other processes operating in the watershed preclude using this record as a reliable paleo-flood proxy.

Seasonal and spatial distribution of redox zones during lake bank filtration in Berlin, Germany	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Redox processes during bank filtration were evaluated in Berlin, where bank filtered water is abstracted for drinking water production. The investigations included the mapping of the infiltration zone, a column study and hydrochemical analyses of the groundwater sampled between lake and production well. The organic carbon content increased and the permeability of the lake sediments decreased with distance from the shoreline. The most important changes with regard to the redox state of the infiltrate occurred within the first metre of flow. Infiltration was mostly anoxic, as oxygen was rapidly consumed within the organic rich sediments. The infiltration zone revealed a vertical redox stratification with hydrochemical conditions becoming more reducing with depth rather than with distance from the lake. The redox zones were found to be very narrow below the lake and wider towards the production wells, suggesting that other than differing flow paths, reaeration after infiltration may also occur and possible mechanisms are presented. Redox conditions were influenced by strong annual temperature variations of the surface water affecting the microbial activity. Aerobic infiltration only took place close to the shore in winter.

J	Li, Y; Zhao, H				Li Yuan; Zhao Hui			Grain-size Age Model in Reconstructing Orbital- and Suborbital-scale Climate Changes on the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau Since the Late Glacial	ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION												Reconstructions of past climatic changes on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP) can provide insights into the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) variability. However, the regional climate changes on both orbital and suborbital time scales since the late Glacial remain controversial. Here we present the results of high-resolution geochemical and grain-size analyses of a sediment core from Genggahai Lake, a small, shallow lake in this area. Changes of the accumulation rate of the core sediments show a similar trend with variations of the coarse fraction. Accordingly, the chronological framework is constructed using a grain-size age model. In addition, the histories of chemical weathering and aeolian activity since the late Glacial are reconstructed based on the Al/Ti ratios and coarse fractions, respectively. The results suggest that an enhanced chemical weathering and a weakened aeolian activity occurred on the NETP under a warmer, wetter climate during the early to mid-Holocene (11.3-6.3 ka cal BP), compared with the late Glacial (17.1-11.3 ka cal BP) and the late Holocene (6.3 ka cal BP to present), which responded mainly to the strengthened ASM on orbital time scale. In addition, the synchronous occurrences of weakened chemical weathering, low lake level and intense aeolian activity on suborbital time scale reflect several episodes of weakened ASM. Furthermore, these episodes largely coincide with the centennial- to millennial-scale cold events in the North Atlantic, which demonstrates the close connection between the ASM and the cooling at high latitudes.					; li, yuan/GZH-3511-2022	Li, Yuan/0000-0002-7110-9180; 													1000-9515	1755-6724				JUN	2020	94	3			SI		698	706		10.1111/1755-6724.14534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.14534													WOS:000544351300013

Palm phytoliths in subarctic Canada imply ice-free winters 48 million years ago during the late early Eocene	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Phytoliths are microscopic siliceous structures produced in specific tissues by many plant families. The morphological features of phytoliths are diagnostic for many plant taxa and, given their inorganic composition, often become part of the fossil record. We used phytolith remains from lacustrine sediments to document the conclusive presence of Arecaceae (palms) in subarctic Canada during the late early Eocene (48 Ma).Methods Palm phytoliths and aquatic microfossils were extracted from lacustrine mudstones in a drill core taken from the Giraffe kimberlite pipe locality using a combination of acid and oxidation treatments under low heat. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to identify, examine and image the microfossils.Key Results Spherical echinate-shaped palm phytoliths with cone-shaped surface tubercles, likely belonging to the tribe Trachycarpeae (subfamily Coryphoideae), were uncovered in 45 strata over a 37-m section of core. We further document in situ linear arrays of phytoliths, or stegmata, from partially decomposed palm foliage. Additionally, four aquatic organisms, largely restricted to warm subtropical and tropical localities today, were also uncovered in the same strata harbouring the palm phytoliths.Conclusions The presence of palm phytoliths allows inference of a warm regional climate during the late early Eocene, with mean cold-month temperatures above freezing despite prolonged winter darkness. This conclusion is supported by the presence of multiple warm-water aquatic organisms that grew extensively in the maar lake. Our findings will help to document the extent and timing of perennial ice formation in the northern hemisphere during the Cenozoic. Finally, the discovery of stegmata documents that this morphological trait had evolved by early Eocene.

These features, and especially the suprainiac fossa, were considered to be uniquely derived for the European and western Asian Neandertals.

Young perch were ingested between sunset and sunrise and digestion rates were estimated from the decrease in weight of perch in stomachs during the day. Walleye predation began in late June and by Oct. the number of young consumed ranged from 17,940-242,900/ha in 1971-73. Concurrent studies indicated an additional 590-56,130 young were eaten by adult perch. Minimum population of young perch in June was calculated by adding to the number of young that survived to fall, the number consumed by walleye and adult perch. Populations reconstructed in this manner approximated independent estimates of the pelagic population in June. Mortality of young perch was apparently attributable to predation by percids and reconstructed populations accurately portrayed seasonal trends in abundance of young perch.																									1977	34	7					925	932		10.1139/f77-144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-144													WOS:A1977DN23400005

Runoff variations in Lake Balkhash Basin, Central Asia, 1779-2015, inferred from tree rings	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Long highly-resolved proxies for runoff are in high demand for hydrological forecasts and water management in arid Central Asia. An accurate (R-2=0.53) reconstruction of October-September discharge of the Ili River in Kazakhstan, 1779-2015, is developed from moisture-sensitive tree rings of spruce sampled in the Tian Shan Mountains. The fivefold extension of the gauged discharge record represents the variability of runoff in the Lake Balkhash Basin for the last 235years. The reconstruction shows a 40year long interval of low discharge preceded a recent high peak in the first decade of the 2000s followed by a decline to more recent levels of discharge not seen since the start of the gauged record. Most reconstructed flow extremes (+/- 2 sigma) occur outside the instrumental record (1936-2015) and predate the start of large dam construction (1969). Decadal variability of the Ili discharge corresponds well with hydrological records of other Eurasian internal drainages modeled with tree rings. Spectral analysis identifies variance peaks (highest near 42year) consistent with main hemispheric oscillations of the Eurasian climatic system. Seasonal comparison of the Ili discharge with sea-level-pressure and geopotential height data suggests periods of high flow likely result from the increased contribution of snow to runoff associated with the interaction of Arctic air circulation with the Siberian High-Pressure System and North Atlantic Oscillation.

Hydrogen isotopes of n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids as tracers of precipitation in a temperate forest and implications for paleorecords	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf waxes (delta D-wax) primarily reflects that of plant source water. Therefore, sedimentary delta D(wa)x records are increasingly used to reconstruct the delta D of past precipitation (delta D-p) and to investigate paleohydrologic changes. Such reconstructions rely on estimates of apparent fractionation (epsilon(app)) between delta D-p and the resulting delta D-wax. However, epsilon(app) values are modified by numerous environmental and biological factors during leaf wax production. As a result, epsilon(app) can vary widely among plant species and growth forms. This complicates estimation of accurate epsilon(app) values and presents a central challenge to quantitative leaf wax paleohydrology. During the 2014 growing season, we examined epsilon(app) in the five deciduous angiosperm tree species (Prunus serotina, Acer saccharinum, Quercus rubra, Quercus alba, and Ulmus americana) that dominate the temperate forest at Brown's Lake Bog, Ohio, USA. We sampled individuals of each species at weekly to monthly intervals from March to October and report delta D values of n-C-29 alkanes (delta Dn-C29 (alkane)) and n-C-28 alkanoic acids (delta Dn-C28 (acid)), as well as xylem (delta D-xw) and leaf water (delta D-lw). n-Alkane synthesis was most intense 2-3 weeks after leaf emergence and ceased thereafter, whereas n-alkanoic acid synthesis continued throughout the entire growing season. During bud swell and leaf emergence, delta D-lw was a primary control on delta Dn-C29 (alkane) and delta Dn-C28 (acid) values, which stabilized once leaves became fully expanded. Metabolic shifts between young and mature leaves may be an important secondary driver of delta D-wax changes during leaf development. In mature autumn leaves of all species, the mean epsilon(app) for n-C29 alkane (-107%) was offset by approximately-19% from the mean epsilon(app) for n-C28 alkanoic acid (-88%). These results indicate that in temperate settings n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids from deciduous trees are distinct with respect to their abundance, timing of synthesis, and epsilon(app) values.

HYPERKYPHOSIS IN LONGNOSE GAR (LEPISOSTEUS OSSEUS) OF NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Two mature female longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus) exhibiting severe hyperkyphotic spinal deformities were captured during the 2010 spring spawn at Lake Arrowhead, Clay County, Texas. Yet, despite their deformities and impaired motility, both longnose gar were in overall good condition. Hyperkyphosis in both longnose gar resulted from fused trunk vertebrae in the affected areas. Results of morphological examinations and computerized tomography (CT) scans showed no evidence of injury-induced responses and suggested a congenital Or possibly environmentally induced aetiology for disruption of the normal vertebral segmentation process.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				APR	2011	71	1					121	126		10.3398/064.071.0118	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.071.0118													WOS:000290602400018

The ionic concentrations of the main cations Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ and the anion Cl- varied depending on cell age, developmental state, and season. The average of all measurements (in mM) was Na+: 35, K+: 106, Ca2+: 7, Mg2+: 23, Cl-: 101, SO42-: 20, and PO43-: 5. At the onset of growth in May/June the ionic content was lower compared to the mean value for the year, steadily increasing until it reached its maximum above the annual mean in winter. During the period of fructification (sexual reproduction: formation of antheridia and oogonia), when up to 100 mM sucrose was accumulated in the vacuolar sap, ionic content was lowest. This resulted in a fairly constant osmotic potential throughout the year. Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations were correlated with the physiological age of the cells.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				NOV	1987	74	1					122	127		10.1007/BF00377355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00377355								28310424					WOS:A1987K686200018
J	Gélinas, M; Pinel-Alloul, B				Gelinas, Malorie; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette			Summer depth selection in crustacean zooplankton in nutrient-poor boreal lakes is affected by recent residential development	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Strong vertical gradients in light, water temperature, oxygen, algal concentration and predator encounters during summer in stratified lakes may influence patterns of depth selection in crustacean zooplankton, especially Daphnia species. 2. To test how crustacean depth selection varies among lakes along a gradient of catchment disturbance by recent residential development and land use change, we calculated the weighted mean depth distribution of the biomass of crustaceans by day and night in eight nutrient-poor boreal lakes. 3. Generally, the greatest biomass of crustaceans was located at the metalimnion or at the lower boundary of the euphotic zone during thermal stratification in July. The crustacean zooplankton avoided warm surface layers and tended to stay in colder deep waters by both day and night. They also remained at greater depths in lakes with a more extensive euphotic zone. 4. There was some evidence of upward nocturnal migrations of large Daphnia and copepods in some lakes, and one case of downward migration in a lake inhabited by chaoborid larvae. 5. Multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to cluster crustaceans and Daphnia species in homogeneous groups based on lake natural and disturbance factors. For crustaceans, the depth of the euphotic zone, the sampling depth (epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion), time (day or night) of sampling and the biomass of chlorophyll a were the main driving factors. For Daphnia species, the drainage area, the sampling depth, the cleared land surface area within the catchment and the concentration of total dissolved phosphorus were the main factors.

Increasing preschoolers' physical activity intensities: An activity-friendly preschool playground intervention	PREVENTIVE MEDICINE												Objective. The purpose of this study was to see if portable play equipment added to a preschool playground resulted in higher intensities of physical activity among 3-5-year-old children. Methods. Activity-friendly equipment was added to an outdoor preschool playground. Accelerometry-measured intensities of 15-s epochs of physical activity were tracked for 5 pre-intervention and 5 post-intervention days during outdoor play. Data were collected during fall 2005 in Salt Lake City for 64 preschoolers aged 3, 4, and 5 years. Results. After the intervention, both male and female 3- to 5-year-olds significantly decreased sedentary behavior and significantly increased light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity as measured by accelerometry. Conclusions. Results suggest simple interventions, requiring little teacher training, can yield increases in healthy physical activity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

J	Dewey, MR; Richardson, WB; Zigler, SJ				Dewey, MR; Richardson, WB; Zigler, SJ			Patterns of foraging and distribution of bluegill sunfish in a Mississippi River backwater: Influence of macrophytes and predation	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We studied the trophic interactions and spatial distributions of bluegills Lepomis macrachirus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in a macrophyte bed in Lake Onalaska, a backwater lake in the upper Mississippi River. The diets of adult and age-0 bluegills were similar and changed seasonally probably in response to changes in life stages of macroinvertebrates (i.e. emergence of winged adults). Diets and diel patterns of abundance of bluegill suggest that age-0 and adults were feeding in the vegetated, littoral zone. Predation by age-0 largemouth bass appears to influence use of vegetated habitat by age-0 bluegills. In summer, when most age-0 bluegills were vulnerable to predation by age-0 largemouth bass, bluegill abundance was strongly correlated with vegetation biomass. In October and November, piscivory by age-0 largemouth bass was limited by gape. Consequently, the relationship between the abundance of age-0 bluegills and vegetation biomass was weakened because predation risk by age-0 largemouth bass was reduced.

Modes of Iron-Manganese Mineralization on the Bottom of Lake Baikal	OCEANOLOGY												The investigation of the bottom of Lake Baikal carried out during the 2008 summer season by means of Mir manned deep-submergence vehicles resulted in the recovery of a series of sediments, ferruginous crusts, and peculiar mineralized tubes several centimeters high and up to 2-6 cm in diameter. According to the scanning electron investigation, these formations consist mainly of the enclosing sediment particles and biogcnie silica cemented by iron and minor manganese hydroxides. The chemical composition of the tubes is similar to both that of the enclosing sediments and slightly ferruginous crusts and nodules, but the tubes and crusts are somewhat richer relative to the sediments in some microelements, namely, arsenic, cadmium, and uranium. In general, the structure and composition of these tubes reminds one of the worm tubes common in the sediments of a number of seas. The investigation of the rare earth elements in some samples or ferruginous formations and sediments revealed a positive europium anomaly, which might be related to either the composition of the surrounding continental magmatic rocks or to the influence of hypothetical hydrothermal solutions.					; Zhegallo, Elena/U-5122-2019	Zhegallo, Elena/0000-0003-1089-9219; 													0001-4370					JUN	2011	51	3					465	475		10.1134/S0001437011030039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001437011030039													WOS:000298562900012
J	Mundahl, ND; Howard, J				Mundahl, Neal D.; Howard, John			Stormwater Management and Late-Winter Chloride Runoff into an Urban Lake in Minnesota, USA	HYDROLOGY												Stormwater runoff containing road deicing salts has led to the increasing salinization of surface waters in northern climates, and urban municipalities are increasingly being mandated to manage stormwater runoff to improve water quality. We assessed chloride concentrations in runoff from late-winter snowmelt and rainfall events flowing into an urban Minnesota, USA, lake during two different years, predicting that specific stormwater drainages with greater concentrations of roadways and parking lots would produce higher chloride loads during runoff than other drainages with fewer impervious surfaces. Chloride levels were measured in runoff draining into Lake Winona via 11 stormwater outfalls, a single channelized creek inlet, and two in-lake locations during each snowmelt or rainfall event from mid-February through early April in 2021 and 2023. In total, 33% of outfall runoff samples entering the lake collected over two years had chloride concentrations exceeding the 230 ppm chronic standard for aquatic life in USA surface waters, but no sample exceeded the 860 ppm acute standard. Chloride concentrations in outfall runoff (mean +/- SD; 190 +/- 191 ppm, n = 143) were significantly higher than in-lake concentrations (43 +/- 14 ppm, n = 25), but chloride levels did not differ significantly between snowmelt and rainfall runoff events. Runoff from highway locations had higher chloride concentrations than runoff from residential areas. Site-specific chloride levels were highly variable both within and between years, with only a single monitored outfall displaying high chloride levels in both years. There are several possible avenues available within the city to reduce deicer use, capture and treat salt-laden runoff, and prevent or reduce the delivery of chlorides to the lake.																				2306-5338				MAR 28	2025	12	4							76	10.3390/hydrology12040076	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology12040076													WOS:001474447300001

The OSL and AMS C-14 chronology suggests that the lake building activity was initiated post-cooling phase since similar to 6484 cal. YBP. The combination of sedimentological, geochemical, and environmental magnetic parameters helped to infer five first-order climatic zones. The influx of magnetic minerals along with a notable increase in antiferromagnetic mineralogy (appearance of hematite) and higher chemical index of alteration (CIA) values during similar to 5925 cal. YBP to 5676 cal. YBP suggests warm and wet conditions owing to enhanced Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) precipitation corresponding to the mid-Holocene warming. Further, reduction in the magnetic mineral concentration with few peaks of antiferromagnetic mineralogy and higher,CIA values suggests warmer episodes within an overall cold climate, and the finer ferrimagnetic grain size suggests intermittent low energy and ponding conditions during similar to 3904 cal. YBP to 2365 cal. YBP. This was followed by fluctuating cold arid conditions in response to reduced ISM precipitation during similar to 2365 cal. YBP and 1758 cal. YBP. Further, between 1758 cal. YBP to the present, episodic warming, pedogenic enhancement, and increased monsoon precipitation have been recorded. A major warm episode (Medieval warm period) as depicted from enhanced antiferromagnetic mineralogy and higher CIA values has been recorded between similar to 742 cal. yrs. BP and 593 cal. YBP. The sudden drop in the magnetic mineral concentration as well as the CIA value, around similar to 300 cal. YBP (1650 CE) is likely because of colder conditions prevailing during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The study illustrated high sensitivity of the lake sediment sequence to witness the climatic episodes experienced in the glaciated regime of the Triloknath glacier. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A Bayesian methodological framework for setting fish tumor occurrence delistinng criteria: A case study in St. Marys River area of concern	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Fish tumors and other deformities are a class of Beneficial Use Impairment (BUIs) established by the International Joint Commission to identify Areas of Concern (AOC) in the Great Lakes basin. The St. Marys River has been impaired by fish tumors and other deformities since its designation as an AOC in 1987. In this study, we present a Bayesian modeling framework that is founded upon the explicit consideration of the sampling bias in tumor observations as well as the causal association between important covariates and tumor occurrence. Data from 2009 indicate that fish tumor incidence rates were generally elevated at the Bellevue Marina and Partridge Point exposed locations relative to the Batchawana Bay reference site. Fish age was the single most important covariate of the tumor incidence rates, followed by the fork length, and the liver or gonad weights. Using the Bayesian counterpart of the two one-side tests for equivalence, the exposed site was practically equivalent to the reference location in regards to the neoplasm and pre-neoplasm incidence rates. However, the mean probability of neoplasm incidence was predicted to be lower than 10% in 70% and 95% of the cases in the exposed and reference sites, respectively. The predicted mean pre-neoplasm frequency never fell below 10% in all the samples collected at the exposed site, whereas approximate to 40% of the cases are predicted to fall below the proposed cut-off level in the reference site suggesting that the exposed site may still be impaired.

Study focus: Total suspended solids (TSS) represents an important water quality parameter in inland waters. This study compared the performance of empirical models, semi-analytical models, and four machine learning models. Then, based on field-measured data, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) model with best performance (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 20.03 mg/L, MAE = 10.8 mg/L, MAPD = 24.89%) was established and applied to Landsat images for retrieval. The spatial-temporal distribution of TSS in Poyang Lake from 1988 to 2022 was obtained. The various effects of driving forces on temporal and spatial variations of TSS concentration in Poyang Lake were analyzed. New hydrological insights for the region: The BPNN model proposed in this study has good performance in the testing dataset and two independent datasets, indicating good generalization ability and spatial portability. The TSS concentration showed an increasing trend over the past 35 years. The seasonal characteristics of TSS are distinct, with higher concentrations in the dry season and obvious variation in summer months. Before 2001, the TSS concentration was highly correlated with precipitation (r =-0.74) and wind speed (r = 0.60). Thereafter, sand mining (r = 0.66) became the main driving force underlying interannual variations in TSS concentration.

In this study, we quantify monthly and seasonal cooling for five contrasting types of green and blue infrastructure (GBI): rivers, lakes, "captured" agricultural areas, urban parks, and golf courses in the Cairo and Giza provinces of Egypt. Using Landsat-8 images of Land Surface Temperature (LST) we assessed change in LST along bisecting transects and in circle plots for three replicates of each GBI type, in each of four seasons. Cooling was greatest in summer for all GBI types. Cooling differentials of LST were greater for water bodies than for green spaces. Ordered by increasing cooling potential (May LST cooling) they were: Agricultural areas (3.3 degrees C), Golf courses (4.3 degrees C), Parks (4.4 degrees C), Lakes (8.2 degrees C) and Rivers (12.2 degrees C). The cooling effects extending into adjacent buffer areas were greatest for blue spaces like rivers and lakes. This paper provides the first data for cooling by less-studied GBI types in arid regions, such as golf courses and urban agriculture. It provides information to support city planners to embrace green and blue spaces within metropolitan areas and to protect them from urban sprawl.

Lake Kumphawapi - an archive of Holocene palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes in northeast Thailand	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The long-term climatic and environmental history of Southeast Asia, and of Thailand in particular, is still fragmentary. Here we present a new C-14-dated, multi-proxy sediment record (TOC, C/N, CNS isotopes, Si, Zr, K, Ti, Rb, Ca elemental data, biogenic silica) for Lake Kumphawapi, the second largest natural lake in northeast Thailand. The data set provides a reconstruction of changes in lake status, groundwater fluctuations, and catchment run-off during the Holocene. A comparison of multiple sediment sequences and their proxies suggests that the summer monsoon was stronger between c. 9800 and 7000 cal yr BP. Lake status and water level changes around 7000 cal yr BP signify a shift to lower effective moisture. By c. 6500 cal yr BP parts of the lake had been transformed into a peatland, while areas of shallow water still occupied the deeper part of the basin until c. 5400-5200 cal yr BP. The driest interval in Kumphawapi's history occurred between c. 5200 and 3200 cal yr BP, when peat extended over large parts of the basin. After 3200 cal yr BP, the deepest part of the lake again turned into a wetland, which existed until c. 1600 cal yr BP. The observed lake-level rise after 1600 cal yr BP could have been caused by higher moisture availability, although increased human influence in the catchment cannot be ruled out. The present study highlights the use of multiple sediment sequences and proxies to study large lakes, such as Lake Kumphawapi in order to correctly assess the time transgressive response to past changes in hydroclimate conditions. Our new data set from northeast Thailand adds important palaeoclimatic information for a region in Southeast Asia and allows discussing Holocene monsoon variability and ITCZ movement in greater detail.

J	Hollinger, GA; Sukhatme, GS				Hollinger, Geoffrey A.; Sukhatme, Gaurav S.			Sampling-based robotic information gathering algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH												We propose three sampling-based motion planning algorithms for generating informative mobile robot trajectories. The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information quality metric (e. g. variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e. g. fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed rapidly exploring information gathering (RIG) algorithms combine ideas from sampling-based motion planning with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient information gathering in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques find optimal solutions more quickly than existing combinatorial solvers, and we provide a proof-of-concept field implementation on an autonomous surface vehicle performing a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake.																			0278-3649	1741-3176				AUG	2014	33	9			SI		1271	1287		10.1177/0278364914533443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0278364914533443													WOS:000342793400007
J	Jones, RN; McMahon, T; Bowler, JM				Jones, RN; McMahon, T; Bowler, JM			Modelling historical lake levels and recent climate change at three closed lakes, Western Victoria, Australia (c.1840-1990)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake levels of three hydrologically closed maar lakes, Lakes Keilambete, Gnotuk and Bullenmerri in Western Victoria, Australia, have declined since the first recorded observations in 1841. High levels were previously sustained for several centuries with the lakes in climatic equilibrium. Historical survey and field investigations provide a detailed picture of both historical land-use changes and of the geological and hydrogeological influences on the water budget. Groundwater components include baseflow from deep percolation within the catchment and discharge from a surrounding low-yield aquifer. A perched watertable at Lake Keilambete helped maintain high lake levels. Climate records back to 1859 were reconstructed; inhomogeneities from 1863 were removed creating a high quality instrumental record. A water balance model simulating the historical decline demonstrates important features. (1) Regional climate expressed as a lake precipitation/evaporation (P/E) ratio remains the over-riding influence on lake levels. (2) The lakes fell in response to a change in climate. (3) This climate change pre-dated instrumental records. (4) Land-use change did not contribute to declining water levels. The fall in water levels was initiated by a decrease in PIE ratio from a pre- 1840 value of 0.94-0.96 to a historical value of 0.79. This change probably involved a decrease in rainfall, possibly associated with increases in solar radiation and decreases in cloud cover. Temperature (T) may also have increased but the likelihood of an altered temperature-evaporation relationship means that a quantified estimate is not possible. The ability of the lakes to reflect climate independently of land-use change is highly unusual, both in Australia and elsewhere. These lakes provide a rare opportunity to discriminate between human impact on regional hydrology and climate change. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Sorvari, S; Korhola, A; Thompson, R				Sorvari, S; Korhola, A; Thompson, R			Lake diatom response to recent Arctic warming in Finnish Lapland	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												High-resolution palaeolimnological data from a number of remote and nonpolluted lakes in Finnish Lapland reveal a distinct change in diatom assemblages. This parallels the post-19th century Arctic warming detected by examination of long-term instrumental series, historical records of ice cover and tree-ring measurements. The change was predominantly from benthos to plankton and affected the overall diatom species richness. A particularly strong relationship was found between spring temperatures and compositional structure of diatoms. The change is irrespective of the lake type and catchment characteristics, and is reflected by several other biological indicators, such as chrysophytes and zooplankton, suggesting that entire lake ecosystems have been affected. No corresponding change in the diatom-inferred lake-water pH was observed; hence, atmospheric fallout of acid substances cannot have been the driving force for the observed biological change. The mechanism behind the diatom response is unclear, but it may be related to decreased ice-cover duration, prolonged growing season and increased thermal stability. We postulate that 19th century Arctic warming, rather than acidic or other anthropogenic deposition, is responsible for the recent ecological changes in these high latitude lakes.

Three recent sediment budget studies from the Wet Swine Gill head-water catchment in the Lake District, Northern England, UK (a 0.65 km(2), first-order tributary), provide evidence of changes in sediment transfer dynamics over the period 2002-2008. The first sediment budget in 2002 describes the impact of a hillslope debris slide and channelised debris flow event, where the former was the dominant budget component. The termination of the debris flow in the Wet Swine Gill channel meant that the vast majority of slide failure material was not transferred to the downstream fluvial system. However, subsequent modification of exposed hillslope sediment by post-event erosion processes and gully development resulted in ongoing erosion. A second sediment budget (June 2003-January 2004) demonstrated sediment yield downstream of the in-channel debris slide deposits far exceeds upstream fluvial sediment delivery by two orders of magnitude (c. 4,000 kg and c. 20 kg, respectively). Erosion of sediment from the exposed hillslope failure scar (c. 1300 kg) was less than channel erosion (c. 3300 kg), and sediment transfers from both the hillslope and channel sediment sources are sensitive to high-magnitude, low-frequency trigger events including summer thunderstorms, and winter rainfall/snow-melt events. However, linear regression analysis only demonstrates weak or insignificant relations between meteorological conditions and sediment yield. A final sediment budget in April 2008 shows the significance of both hillslope (inclusive of gullying) and channel erosion/transfer processes over the six-year monitoring period. In this budget, like the first sediment budget, the hillslope system is marginally more dominant, and therefore demonstrates a further switch in the relative significance of hillslope and channel system components. When interpreting such findings the potential uncertainty in the budget components, particularly in the unmeasured residual components, should be considered, as the magnitude of the error can be large. These results suggest that contemporary event and post-event sediment flux in small headwater catchments are more complex than short-term investigations would initially suggest. Furthermore there is a clear need for continued, longer-term monitoring of sediment system dynamics and associated hydro-meteorological conditions, in order to develop understanding of how future climate change may impact upland sediment systems.																			0435-3676	1468-0459					2010	92A	2					189	209		10.1111/j.1468-0459.2010.00389.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0459.2010.00389.x													WOS:000278308200005

J	Jaschinski, S; Brepohl, DC; Sommer, U				Jaschinski, Sybill; Brepohl, Daniela C.; Sommer, Ulrich			The trophic importance of epiphytic algae in a freshwater macrophyte system (Potamogeton perfoliatus L.): stable isotope and fatty acid analyses	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Stable isotope and fatty acid analyses were used to study carbon sources for animals in a submerged plant bed. Epiphytes growing on Potamogeton perfoliatus, sand microflora, and alder leaves were the most important carbon sources. The most abundant macrophyte, P. perfoliatus was unimportant as a food source. Modelling (IsoSource) showed that epiphytes were the most important food source for the most abundant benthic invertebrates, the isopod Asellus aquaticus (annual mean contribution 64%), the amphipod Gammarus pulex (66%), and the gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum (83%). The mean annual contributions of sand microflora were, respectively, 21, 19, and 9%; and of alder leaves, 15, 15, and 8% for these three species. The relative importance of carbon sources varied seasonally. The relative contribution of epiphytes was lowest for all three grazer species in July: A. aquaticus 38%, G. pulex 43%, and P. antipodarum 42%. A decline in epiphyte biomass in summer may have caused this switch to less attractive food sources. P. perfoliatus provided habitat and shelter for consumers, but food was mainly supplied indirectly by providing space for attached epiphytes, which are fast-growing and provide a highly nutritious food source.																			1015-1621					FEB	2011	73	1					91	101		10.1007/s00027-010-0163-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-010-0163-6													WOS:000286667600009
J	Cazzaniga, I; Zibordi, G; Alikas, K; Kratzer, S				Cazzaniga, Ilaria; Zibordi, Giuseppe; Alikas, Krista; Kratzer, Susanne			Temporal changes in the remote sensing reflectance at Lake V?nern	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Aerosol Robotic Network -Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) instrument located at the Palgrunden site in Lake Vanern provides values of remote sensing spectral reflectance RRS(2,,,) since 2008. These in situ RRS(2,,,) indicated a temporal increase from 2015 at center-wavelengths in the green and red spectral regions. To investigate the environmental and climate processes responsible for this increase, water color trends in Lake Vanern were analyzed considering in situ limnological measurements, meteo-climatic quantities and additionally satellite-derived data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on board the Aqua platform (MODIS-A). Satellite ocean color RRS(2,,,) data assessed against in situ RRS(2,,,) from the Palgrunden site showed satisfactory agreement at a number of spectral bands. Relying on these validation results, comprehensive statistical analysis were performed using MODIS-A RRS(2,,,). These indicated periodical changes between 2002 and 2021 with clear minima occurring between 2010 and 2013. The complementary analyses of temporal changes characterizing limological and meteo-climatic quantities, and also relationships between these quantities and RRS(2,,,), indicated the existence of complex and concurrent bio-geochemical processes influencing water color in Lake Vanern. In particular, significant correlations were observed between RRS(2,,,) and turbidity, and also between RRS(2,,,) and total biovolume. Additionally, an early warming of Lake Vanern surface waters was identified since spring 2014. This occurrence could potentially affect the vertical mixing and water exchange between turbid coastal and pelagic waters with implications for phytoplankton phenology. (c) 2023 The Authors.

The objectives were to develope a technique suitable for the mass marking of coregonids, to evaluate the possible effects of marking on the survival of fish and the retention of marks. The most important modifications that were done to the marking fish technique were "wet" spraying (pigment mixed with water), and adjusting the spraying pressure to be suitable for coregonids. Markings were done for different stocks of whitefish and vendace. The fish were reared in natural food ponds or in cages in a lake or the sea. In the first experiment, the acute mortality (24 h after marking) was considerably high (27.2%-67.4%) because the applied compressed air pressure that is used to spray the pigment appeared to be too high for coregonids. Later markings were done using lower air pressure, and after that the acute mortality (24 h after marking) was between 0% and 3% in all markings, when the fish density after marking and the water temperature were not too high (10 degrees C). No long-term mortality has ih:en detected. The retention of marks has been 99%-100% three years after marking for two control lots of whitefish marked in 1993, and 89%-97% one year after marking for three control lots of vendace marked in 1993. In 1994 and 1995, fluorescent spray marking was used for mass markings of whitefish for stocking in the Finnish Gulf and Gulf of Bothnia.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						471	477																WOS:000078180200048

J	NEEDLEMAN, SB; PORVAZNIK, M; ANDER, D				NEEDLEMAN, SB; PORVAZNIK, M; ANDER, D			CREATININE ANALYSIS IN SINGLE COLLECTION URINE SPECIMENS	JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES												Controlled and uncontrolled fluid intake studies were conducted on series of volunteers over the 6 or 12 h of the study periods. Urine specimens were obtained from each subject randomly or at specified times relative to fluid ingestion. Creatinine analysis performed by a modification of the Abbott TDx procedure demonstrates that the values obtained from single collection specimens fall almost in the same range as the values from 24 h pooled collection specimens. The creatinine concentration can be used to indicate possible adulteration of urine specimens by dilution as a means of avoiding detection of use of drugs of abuse. Between 4 and 7 h are required for a decrease in creatinine concentration to about 100 mg/dL from an initial mean of about 170 mg/dL. A minimum of 6 h is needed for any creatinine value to fall to 50 mg/dL or less. Thus, it appears that creatinine output is sensitive to the amount of fluid ingested, but the relationship is neither linear nor immediate. The absence of a significant creatinine concentration in a specimen can be used as an indication of direct or indirect adulteration of the urine specimen by dilution or replacement with water. At NDSL-Great Lakes, a decline of the creatinine concentration to 30 mg/dL is used as a cutoff for differentiating between urine specimens that might have been tampered with to avoid detection of drug use and those specimens that are dilute for other reasons. Values at 10 mg/dL or less are suggestive of replacement by water. The information is provided to local commands for investigation prior to initiation of punitive action by the command.																			0022-1198					JUL	1992	37	4					1125	1133											1506830					WOS:A1992JY40500022
J	Pascoe, DA; Hicks, RE				Pascoe, DA; Hicks, RE			Genetic structure and community DNA similarity of picoplankton communities from the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The similarity of picoplankton assemblages in the epilimnia (5 m) and mid-hypolimnia (45 to 70 m) of several Laurentian Great Lakes was compared by quantitative 16S rRNA-based and community DNA hybridizations to determine if different picoplankton communities develop during the summer in these water masses. Total nucleic acids were extracted and purified from picoplankton collected in Lakes Erie, Ontario, Huron, Michigan, and Superior during July and August 1992. Based on 16S rRNA hybridizations, the majority of picoplanktonic nucleic acids (91 % to 98%) were from bacteria. Microeucaryotes accounted for less than 3% of the total nucleic acids. Up to 2% of the picoplanktonic nucleic of acids were contributed by archaea. The genetic similarity of picoplankton communities was estimated by pair wise hybridization of heterogeneous DNA samples. This similarity is an estimate of the fraction of total DNA shared in common between two communities. Total picoplanktonic DNA in the epilimnia of all lakes except Lake Superior was similar during August ( >= 70% similarity). At most sites in these lakes, however, the community DNA of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic picoplankton was different. A high abundance of cyanobacterial nucleic acids in Lake Ontario's epilimnion may explain why the community DNA of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic picoplankton was different in this lake. Together, the results verify that bacteria account for the majority of picoplankton in these great lakes but also indicate that different picoplankton communities can form in the epilimnion and hypolimnion during summer after these lakes become thermally stratified.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			185	195		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70385-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70385-8													WOS:000227991500013

The combination of seismic profiling (3.5 kHz), piston coring and radiocarbon dating in proglacial lacustrine sediments together with a detailed organic analysis of autochthonous and allochthonous supply allows documenting the evolution of glacier activity during the Holocene. Over the last 9700 years, the Holocene lake record has a bimodal pattern whose transition is progressive and occurring between 5400 and 4700 cal BP. During the Early Holocene, the organic lacustrine facies reflects reduced glacial activity in the catchment. This major glacial retreat seems to result from solar forcing and high summer insolation. After 5400 cal BP, lacustrine sedimentation is marked by the gradual increase both of minerogenic supply and soil erosion, suggesting a progressive transition to wetter climatic conditions. This climate change is synchronous both from the gradual decrease of summer insolation and the gradual reorganization of oceanic and atmospheric circulations, characterizing the beginning of the Neoglacial period. Both colder temperature and humid climate induced significant glacier advance, since 4700 cal BP. Over this global trend, three periods are particularly associated with higher runoff processes and higher soil erosion interpreted as wetter time intervals resulting from enhanced northern Westerlies regimes across the North Atlantic and Western Europe. They are dated from 8700 to 7000, 4700 to 2500 and 1200 to 200 cal BP. These wetter phases drastically contrast with periods of reduced glacial activities dated from the Early Bronze Age (ca 3870-3770 cal BP), the Iron Age (ca 2220-2150 cal BP), the Roman period (ca AD115-330) and the Medieval Warm Period (ca AD760-1160). In addition, these dryer periods are associated with mining activities at high-altitude. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To develop an in-depth understanding of the status of TP lake carbon storage and its response to global changes and human activities, we accurately quantified the change trend of long-term organic carbon burial in lakes over the TP, compared levels of differentiation within the TP, and explored related driving factors of the carbon accumulation rates (CARs) by compiling 24 lake sediment cores. The results show that the lake CAR over the TP presented a rising trend during the Holocene, with an average of 6.50 g C m-2 yr-1 and levels ranging from 1.75 to 18.41 g C m-2 yr-1. The eastern TP (ETP), with warmer and wetter climate conditions and more vegetation coverage, had almost twice the CAR as that of the central and western TP (CWTP). We demonstrate that climate and vegetation could be the main drivers of the lake CAR on the TP despite environmental heterogeneity contributing to subregional discrepancies. During the early Holocene, superior summer temperatures and precipitation favored vegetation development, providing abundant material for lake carbon deposition. In the middle Holocene, together with vigorous vegetation, decreasing summer temperatures led to a decline in mineralization, which enhanced carbon storage efficiency and resulted in an increase in the CAR across the ETP. In contrast, for the CWTP, herbaceous-dominated vegetation continued to expand during the early-mid Holocene, which constrained detritus supply, thus maintaining a relatively stable CAR. However, intensive human activities could be responsible for the CAR peak in the late Holocene on the TP, especially since 2000 cal yr BP. In addition to the anthropogenic impacts, variations in CAR among lakes resulting from local factors lead to large uncertainties in future C predictions for the whole region of TP.

The sampling period was between June 1994 and May 1995 in the Sinop region of northern Turkey and a total of 125 common carp were investigated. The overall incidence of T. mutabilis infestation was 80.7% in the farm and 61.7% in the lake, whilst it was 44.8% in the farm and 36.1% in the lake for the collective T. acuta - T. nigra group. Spring was found to be the most favoured season. There was no statistically significant preference of the collective T. acuta - T. nigra group to any of the varieties of common carp or the sex of the host. T. mutabilis also showed similar preferences to the collective T. acuta - T. nigra group.					; Özer, Ahmet/ABA-7298-2020	OZER, AHMET/0000-0002-2890-6766; 													0065-1583					FEB	2000	39	1					61	66																WOS:000085652400008

Use of a cool, nearshore groundwater discharge site, a behavior never before documented for lake trout, was observed among some fish in the shallow lake when ambient lake temperatures exceeded the species' preferred thermal range of 6-13 degrees C. We suggest that during very warm years, groundwater refugia may be important habitat for lake trout and that these refugia should be protected.

The warming rate of air temperature observed at the meteorological station in Chersky was 0.0472 degrees C.year(-1), and an extraordinary increase in air temperatures was observed in 2007. However, data from meteorological stations are somewhat limited in sparsely populated regions. Therefore, this study employed historical remote sensing data for supplementary information. The time-series analysis of the area-averaged Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation showed a positive trend because warming leads to an increase in the water vapor content in the atmosphere. In particular, heavy precipitation of 459 +/- 113 mm was observed in 2006. On the other hand, the second-highest summer National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution radiometer (AVHRR) brightness temperature (BT) was observed in 2007 when the highest air temperature was observed in Chersky, and the anomaly from normal revealed that the summer AVHRR BTs showed mostly positive values. Conversely, riverbank, lakeshore and seashore areas were much cooler due to the formation, expansion and drainage of lakes and/or the increase in water level by heavy precipitation and melting of frozen ground. The large lake drainage resulted in a flood. Although the flooding was triggered by the thermal erosion along the riverbanks and lakeshores-itself induced by the heat wave in 2007-the increase in soil water content due to the heavy precipitation in 2006 appeared to contribute the magnitude of flood. The flood was characterized by the low streamflow velocity because the Kolyma Lowlands had a very gentle gradient. Therefore, the flood continued for a long time over large areas. Information based on remote sensing data gave basic insights for understanding the mechanism and behavior of climate-induced extreme hydrologic events.

H.; Snider, Dave			Riverine transport and nutrient inputs affect phytoplankton communities in a coastal embayment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Rivers often transport phytoplankton to coastal embayments and introduce nutrients that can enrich coastal plankton communities. We investigated the effects of the Nottawasaga River on the nearshore (i.e. within 500 mu m of shore) phytoplankton composition along a 10-km transect of Nottawasaga Bay, Lake Huron in 2015 and 2016. Imaging flow cytometry was used to identify and enumerate algal taxa, which were resolved at sizes larger than small nanoplankton (i.e. >5 mu m). Multivariate analysis (perMANOVA and redundancy analysis) and a dilution model were used to examine how nutrients and the transport of algal taxa affected community composition in the bay. Sampling stations with different percentages of river water had significantly different phytoplankton communities. Phytoplankton community composition was also strongly associated with nutrients, including total phosphorus, which also varied with the percentage of river water. The majority of the 51 phytoplankton taxa identified in 2016 had numerical abundances in the bay that could be explained simply by the dilution of incoming river water. Phytoplankton transported from the river had a higher proportion of edible-sized cells (<30 mu m), particularly in summer when colonial cyanobacteria were numerically dominant in the bay. Six taxa were more abundant than expected from the dilution of river water and included some cyanobacteria with late summer maxima. Five of the taxa that were transported from the river were less abundant than expected in the bay. Whereas impacts of fertilisation due to the characteristically higher nutrient concentration in the river are to be expected, the strong and highly correlated effects of transport within the narrow coastal band of this study largely concealed any distinct fertilisation effects. Riverine inputs may strongly influence the nearshore assemblage of phytoplankton in oligotrophic embayments in large lakes, creating hotspots for productivity, species turnover, and trophic dynamics.

Thermal waters of "tectonic origin': the alkaline, Na-HCO3 waters of the Rio Valdez geothermal area (Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Argentina)	GEOFLUIDS												The geothermal area of Rio Valdez is located in the central portion of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego (South Argentina), ten kilometers south of the southeastern sector of the Fagnano Lake. It consists of a series of thermal springs with low discharge rates (1L/s) and temperatures in the range of 2033 degrees C distributed in an area of <1km2. The thermal springs are characterized by alkaline, Na-HCO3 waters with low salinity (0.53 divided by 0.58g/L), but relatively high fluoride contents (up to 19.4mg/L). Their composition is the result of a slow circulation at depth, possibly through deep tectonic discontinuities connected with the Magallanes-Fagnano Fault (MFF) system. According to geothermometric calculations, thermal waters reach temperatures in the range of 100150 degrees C and an almost complete chemical equilibrium with the alkali-feldspars in the metavolcanic country rocks. The relatively high fluorine contents can be explained by the slow ascent and cooling of deep groundwaters followed by a progressive re-equilibration with F-bearing, hydrated Mg-silicates, such as chlorite, which has been recognized as an abundant mineral in the metavolcanics of the Lemaire Formation and metapelites and metagraywackes of the Yahgan Formation. Finally, the isotopic composition of the investigated samples is consistent with the infiltration from local snow melting at altitudes in the range of 610770m asl. The comparison of our data with those collected in 1991 seems to suggest a possible progressive decline of the bulk thermal output in the near future. This possibility should be seriously considered before planning a potentially onerous exploitation of the resource. Presently, the only ways to exploit this geothermal resource by the population scattered in the area are the direct use of thermal waters and/or spa structures.					; Delgado Huertas, Antonio/F-6866-2011	Delgado Huertas, Antonio/0000-0002-7240-1570; MENICHETTI, Marco/0000-0003-2901-0715; 													1468-8115	1468-8123				FEB	2013	13	1								10.1111/gfl.12005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gfl.12005													WOS:000314895500002

The 11 metals (Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V) investigated in nearly 3000 lakes have generally low concentrations and distinct geographical patterns. Direct and indirect influence of long-range transported air pollution is the major important factor for distribution of Pb, Cd, Zn and to a certain degree Co. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in lakes are important for Fe and Mn but also to a certain degree for As, Cr and V. Bedrock geology is the-major controlling factor for Cu and Ni, with the exception of areas around the smelters in the Kola peninsula, where the Cu and Ni concentrations in lakes are very high due to local airborne pollution. Bedrock and surficial geology is also an important factor for controlling the concentrations of As, Co, Cr and V. The results indicate that heavy metal pollution in lakes is a minor ecological problem on a regional scale in the Nordic countries.

Wastewater sources of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) and pharmaceuticals in four Canadian Arctic communities	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Effective removal of organic contaminants in wastewater effluent poses a challenge to small communities worldwide, particularly in the Arctic due to infrastructure challenges and harsh climates. To understand better the efficacy of current treatment options and risks posed by pharmaceuticals and pesticides on receiving waters in the Arctic, four representative human communities in Nunavut, Canada were evaluated. Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) were also investigated in one community. These communities have treatment ranging from primary lagoons, engineered wetlands, and natural lakes. Pharmaceuticals and pesticides were measured using the organic diffusive gradients in thin film (o-DGT) passive sampler in summer 2018. Of the 34 compounds studied, seven pharmaceuticals were found at least once: atenolol, carbamazepine, metoprolol, naproxen, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. With the exception of 5210 ng naproxen/L in lqaluit, most receiving waters showed negligible amounts of contamination. lqaluit had the poorest overall system performance while Baker Lake had the best. Measured pharmaceutical concentrations do not appear to pose a significant acute hazard to receiving waters at this time, based on known toxicological endpoints. PFAS concentrations were found to be over 100-fold greater in Cambridge Bay wastewater than previously reported Arctic seawater. Results suggest that wastewater may be an important point source of PFASs in Arctic communities. The o-DGT passive samplers performed well in marine Arctic settings. We recommend further testing of wastewater efficiencies in Arctic communities along with evaluations of seasonal variations. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

There is a shift of the .lambda.max towards shorter wavelengths during the winter in both of these species coinciding with similar changes in the quality of downwelling light. .lambda.max is significantly correlated to the .lambda.P50 and spectrum width of the downwelling light and dissolved oxygen. An analysis of variance shows that there are significant differences between the .lambda.max values of: fish in the two lakes, fish at different times, the two species at different times and fish in different lakes at different seasons. The offset visual pigments of both species appear to be well adapted to their photic environment in terms of the contrast hypothesis.

J	Oh, SG; Sushama, L				Oh, Seok-Geun; Sushama, Laxmi			Urban-climate interactions during summer over eastern North America	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The urban heat island is a representative urban climate characteristic, which can affect heat-stress conditions and extreme precipitation that are closely connected with human life. Better understanding of urban-climate interactions, therefore, is crucial to ultimately support better planning and adaptation in various application fields. This study assesses urban-climate interactions during summer for eastern North America using regional climate model simulations at 0.22 degrees resolution. Two regional climate model experiments, with and without realistic representation of urban regions, are performed for the 1981-2010 period. Comparison of the two experiments shows higher mean temperatures and reduced mean precipitation in the simulation with realistic urban representation, which can be attributed primarily to reduced albedo and soil moisture for the urban regions in this simulation. Furthermore, the mean temperature and precipitation in the simulation with improved urban representation is also closer to that observed. Analysis of short-duration precipitation extremes for climatologically different sub-regions, however, suggests that, for higher temperatures, the magnitudes of precipitation extremes are generally higher in the simulation with realistic urban representation, particularly for coastal urban regions, and are collocated with higher values of convective available potential energy and cloud fraction. Enhanced sea and lake breezes associated with lower sea level pressure found around these regions, contribute additional water vapor and further enhance dynamic convective development, leading to higher precipitation intensities. Analysis of temperature extremes clearly demonstrates that urban regions experience aggravated heat-stress conditions due to relatively higher temperatures despite reduced relative humidity. Double the number of extreme heat spells lasting six or more days are noted for the coastal urban regions in the study domain. This study, in addition to demonstrating the differences in urban-climate interactions for climatologically different regions, also demonstrates the need for better representation of urban regions in climate models to generate realistic climate information.

The Amazon region can be considered a "hotspot" for the study of mercury (Hg), due to the naturally high concentration of the pollutant in its old soils and the anthropogenic emissions from small-scale gold mining activities. The periodic flooding influences the availability and distribution of Hg contamination. Therefore, it is possible that flooding can influence accumulation of Hg in fish. The aim of this study was to evaluate total Hg (THg) concentration in four seasons (rising water, high water, falling water and low water) in six fish guilds in a lentic part of a floodplain system (Puruzinho Lake). We hypothesized that fish guilds would show different seasonal patterns of THg concentration variation. A total of 2016 fish specimens were sampled over the four seasons. Two-way ANOVA indicated an interaction between guilds and seasonality (F = 7.3; p < 0.001), suggesting different seasonal patterns of THg concentration variation among the guilds. Two major patterns were identified. Herbivorous, detritivorous, carnivorous and piscivorous fish guilds showed higher concentrations during the rising and low water seasons, while planktivorous and omnivorous guilds showed lower THg levels during the low water season. There were no significant differences in THg levels between the early and late periods of each season.

This paper presents a well-dated and multi-proxy cored record from a natural freshwater wetland developed in a paleo-pingo-related depression on the Sanjiang Plain. The study aims to reconstruct the wetland water-level and vegetational regimes during the past similar to 6.0 ka BP and discuss the wetland evolution response to the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) circulation. The results show that a shallow-water lake with hygrophilous herbs developed in the depression with a strong EASM during similar to 6.0-4.5 ka BP. The paleolake was succeeded by a wetland with a lowered mean water level and an increase in tree cover controlled by the weakened EASM during the past 4.5 ka BP. Such an ecological lake-to-wetland transition corresponds well to the sharp decline of the EASM around 4.5 ka BP which has been well documented in various geological records across the EASM domain. During the wetland developing stage over the past 4.5 ka BP, the water-level and vegetational changes in the studied depression were also closely related to the EASM variations. The strengthened EASM usually generated higher water levels with more hygrophilous herbs around 4.0 ka BP, 3.5 ka BP, 3.0 ka BP, 2.0 ka BP, and 1.3 ka BP. Considering the prevalent EASM climate serving as the predominant water supply for the wetlands on the modern Sanjiang Plain, we suggest the EASM circulation has played a critical role in driving the wetland ecological evolution during the mid-to-late Holocene Epoch. The past 0.4 ka BP is an exception as the local Trees/Herbs ratio visibly increased with the declined water level, while the monsoonal precipitation shows no equivalent shift. The wetland evolution at this stage was attributed to human interference.					; Jiang, Mingliang/GXG-4039-2022	Yao, Qiang/0000-0003-4833-7510; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2021	203								105332	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105332		APR 2021											WOS:000654354000031

Denitrification rates were estimated either from nitrate loss under anoxic conditions or with a Michaelis-Menten-based approach. The latter included correction terms to account for temperature variations and oxygen inhibition. For this kinetic approach, 2 critical parameters (cell count and maximum turnover rate) are needed. As gene copy numbers obtained by qPCR do not distinguish between viable and non-viable cells, most probable number (MPN)-based cell counts were also tested for their suitability in the Michaelis-Menten approach. At the beginning of the stratification period, about 1% of the denitrifiers calculated from nirS gene copy numbers were cultivable. Nitrate loss and calculated qPCR-based denitrification rates differed by only 1 order of magnitude (mean rates 40.74 and 1.27 mu mol l(-1 )d(-1), respectively). During the stratification period, the difference between qPCR-based calculated denitrification rates and measured nitrate loss increased by up to 4 orders of magnitude, resulting in an enormous overestimation of the calculated denitrification rates. Calculations based only on the numbers of cultivable cells from the MPN counts were significantly lower than the nitrate loss in the lake. Neither nirS gene copy numbers nor MPN counts were suitable for determining the real number of metabolically active denitrifiers. Therefore, additional methods (e.g. propidium monoazide-PCR, viability staining or model strains) are needed to identify the real portion of metabolically active cells.

Spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended sediment causing persistent turbidity in a large reservoir: Lake Dalrymple, Queensland, Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												High turbidity in reservoirs may negatively affect aquatic ecology and water infrastructure. Although many reservoirs are turbid, the origin and intra-and interannual variability of turbidity is not well understood. To examine the cause and variability of turbidity, we measured the concentration, particle size, organic content and mineralogy of suspended and benthic sediment samples from Lake Dalrymple, a large reservoir in northern dry tropical Queensland. Samples were collected during the dry season (May-November) in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2011. Water in the reservoir is turbid (>45 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)) throughout the year, predominantly due to colloidal particles (<0.9 mm) composed of clay and mica minerals. Benthic sediments range from 1 to 30 mmin size, suggesting that resuspension of lake bottom sediments has little effect on turbidity. Dry season turbidity levels are strongly affected by the magnitude and duration of inflow waters from the preceding wet season, reflecting the limited availability of suspended particles delivered from the upstream catchment.

The effects of cool and variable temperatures on the hatch date, growth and overwinter mortality of a warmwater fish in small coastal embayments of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Little is known about the ecology of warmwater fish in small coastal embayments (<32 ha) where temperatures are lowered by exchange with the adjacent lake. Using pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbous) as a model warmwater fish, we compare hatch dates and overwinter survival in two embayments with higher and lower amounts of cold-water input from Lake Ontario, in a warmer and cooler year. In 2007, the embayments differed by approximately 2-5 degrees C until late-July. In that year, temperatures in the cooler embayment delayed hatching times until July 18-August 20, approximately eight weeks later (May 24-August 20) than in the warmer embayment Almost all offspring in the cooler embayment were likely too small to survive the winter. In 2008 both embayments had similar temperatures. In that year, pumpkinseed started hatching in early-June, and most were likely large enough to survive the winter. The findings from the two intensively sampled embayments were confirmed with a 21-year fish monitoring dataset; adult pumpkinseed were captured in the littoral zone of warm embayments 6-8 weeks earlier than in cooler embayments. Relative to pumpkinseed in the small inland lakes of eastern and central Ontario, spawning is delayed by at least two weeks in coastal embayments. Using water temperatures as a surrogate for growth, we calculated that only 5 of the 17 embayments for which we have temperature records were able to consistently produce successfully overwintering age-0 fish. Nevertheless, we found pumpkinseed age >= 1 in embayments too cold to produce age-0 pumpkinseed, suggesting immigration from warmer embayments.

In SVAL the predominant suspended mineral changed from smectite to vermiculite and clinoptilolite, which led to a depletion of soluble Mg2+. Nitrate became depleted in both playas as a result of biological nitrogen demand imparted by unusually dense microbial communities reaching similar to 1 x 10(8) cultivable heterotrophs per ml of water. One hundred eighty eight bacterial isolates were obtained, representing sixty phylotypes and four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the microbial communities reflected different phases of succession, with SVAL changing from a diverse community with abundant Yonghaparkia to a less diverse late summer community with abundant Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria such as Loktanella, Rhodobaca, Saccharospirillum, Flexibacter, and phylogenetically novel members of the Flexibacteriaceae. In EP, a diverse assemblage of bacteria often associated with soils was replaced very quickly by a much less even community dominated by Yonghaparkia, Sandarakinorhabdus, and relatives of Belliella baltica. Strikingly, the early summer microbial community from SVAL was not significantly different from the EP community that developed within one week of flooding, even though these playas are almost 1000 km apart, whereas sympatric communities in different phases of succession were different. To our knowledge, this is one of the first geomicrobiological studies of a recharge playa, the dominant playa type worldwide.					; Hedlund, Brian/HJY-8944-2023	Hedlund, Brian/0000-0001-8530-0448; 													0149-0451	1521-0529					2008	25	5					250	259		10.1080/01490450802153033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490450802153033													WOS:000257082100004

Evaluation of antibiotic resistance of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria isolated from water objects of the north-west of the Murmansk region	ARCTIC BIOMONITORING	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Conference on Arctic Biomonitoring	NOV 26-27, 2018	M V Lomonosov No Fed Univ, Arkhangelsk, RUSSIA		M V Lomonosov No Fed Univ			Multidrug antimicrobial resistance among different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae remains a major problem worldwide. In this paper, we report the data on antimicrobial susceptibility of 145 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae collected in 14 water environments of the north-west of the Murmansk region in autumn 2016. The number of Enterobacteriaceae in the examined rivers was rather low. Only the concentration of enterobacteria exceed the regulations in water samples from lake Kuetsjarvi. The detected isolates were assigned to eight species of enterobacteria. The most abundant species were Enterobacter spp. (26.9%) and Citrobacter freundii (25.3%). Isolates of Escherichia coli were not detected. Most of the isolates (96.6%) were multi-drug resistance (MDR). Notably, 16.6% of the all isolates were categorized as possible extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Almost all isolates were showing high level resistance to beta-lactams, especially to cefepime and imipenem. Most effective antimicrobial agent. were tobramycin and norfloxacin.					; Trunyakova, Alexandra/AAE-3874-2019; Zatsarinnaya, Ekaterina/ABG-1705-2021	Trunyakova, Alexandra/0000-0001-9223-2105; Zatsarinnaya, Ekaterina/0000-0002-2011-4297; 													1755-1307						2019	263								012035	10.1088/1755-1315/263/1/012035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/263/1/012035													WOS:000491940700035

Through more than 150 years, Beethoven, Debussy, Chen Peixun, the composers from three different countries in the world talked about three different emotions, different life experiences, different musical genres, different creation backgrounds, different music performances, different artistic conceptions, which interworked into their unique moonlight. The moonlight is soft and gloomy, or quiet and clear, or painful and helpless. But no matter what kind of moonlight, it all expresses the pursuit of individuality of the composer as well as the infinite love of life and nature. This article compares the three different moonlights in order to reveal the different music image and its charm of these three works.																			2352-5398		978-94-6252-438-5				2017	171																							WOS:000426491800005

J	Salinger, MJ; Fitzharris, BB; Chinn, T				Salinger, Michael J.; Fitzharris, Blair B.; Chinn, Trevor			Atmospheric circulation and ice volume changes for the small and medium glaciers of New Zealand's Southern Alps mountain range 1977-2018	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												New Zealand has a long, continuous record of annual measurements of the altitude of end-of-summer-snowline for a set of 50 Southern Alps "index glaciers." The record begins for the 1976-1977 glacier year and continues to the present. These are equivalent to equilibrium line altitude (ELA) data. An earlier paper used these to estimate annual mass balance and ice volume for all glaciers up to 2008 and showed a steady decline in ice volume, but with considerable inter-annual fluctuations. These results are updated to 2018 for the more than 3,000 small and medium-size glaciers of the Southern Alps. The inclusion of the latter year enabled assessment of the impacts on ice volume of these glaciers from an unprecedented coupled ocean-atmosphere heatwave in the New Zealand region during the austral summer (DJF) 2017/18. The main purpose of this paper is to examine how these changes in ice volume relate to variability and trends in atmospheric circulation and weather types over four decades. Years with ice volume gains are characterized by below average temperature anomalies, enhanced southwest flow and a tendency for trough weather types over New Zealand. Years with ice volume losses have above average temperature, reduced southwest flow, and increased blocking weather types, with more anticyclones east of New Zealand. Largest annual ice volume loss of 3.6 +/- 0.6 km(3) (-13.5%) occurred during the 2017/18 summer heatwave for which the main atmospheric anomalies are discussed. Total ice volume of the Southern Alps for the small and medium glaciers has decreased from 26.6 km(3) in 1977 to 17.9 km(3) in 2018 (a loss of 8.6 km(3) or 33%) at a rate of 0.21 km(3) a(-1). From 1977 to 1997 there was an annual ice gain of +0.30 km(3) a(-1) but was followed by an accelerating ice loss of -0.67 km(3) a(-1) for the period 1998-2018. There are significant correlations between ice volume changes and the Trenberth regional circulation indices Z1, Z3 and MZ3. Strongest relationships are with the Southern Annular Mode: a trend towards more positive values coincides with a general loss of ice volume. The Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation and El Nino/Southern Oscillation relate to ice volume changes on decadal to inter-annual time scales. Positive phases of the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation and El Nino years favour ice volume growth as they are cooler, with more precipitation, troughs and southwest flow over New Zealand. Negative phases of the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation and La Nina years favour ice volume loss as they are warmer with less precipitation, more anticyclones and east or northeast flow. The dominant driver for 2017/18 was the positive Southern Annular Mode, and a smaller contribution from La Nina on a background of regional warming. Climate scenarios suggest that such conditions will be rather frequent by the 2,080-2,100 decades, with consequent large reductions in ice volume.																			0899-8418	1097-0088				SEP	2019	39	11					4274	4287		10.1002/joc.6072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.6072													WOS:000483703900006

The Yongding River Basin has many irrigated areas, and excessive agricultural water consumption has led to serious water shortages and ecosystem damage. To investigate the evolution of ecohydrological conditions and their driving factors in the Yongding River basin in a changing environment, this study combines indicators of hydrologic alteration with the range of variability approach (IHA-RVA) to identify the most ecologically relevant hydrological indicators (ERHIs) and to determine the periods of hydrological variability in the basin, using the Xiangshuipu section on the Yang River as the study area. By calculating the degree of hydrological alteration, the evolutionary pattern of ecohydrological conditions in the basin was analyzed, and the WetSpa model was used to quantitatively identify the contributions of climate change, reservoir storage, and irrigation water withdrawal to the alteration of hydrological conditions. The results showed that the rise and fall rate; maximum and minimum 1 day flows; dates of maximum flow; and July flows were the most ecologically relevant hydrological indicators for the Xiangshuipu section. Variability of this section occurred between 1982 and 1988; except for the annual maximum 1 day flows and fall rate, which underwent moderate changes; all other indicators exhibited small changes and the overall hydrological alteration of the Xiangshuipu section was low. The most influential change in the hydrological conditions was irrigation water withdrawal (from specific irrigation); followed by climate change and reservoir storage. The results of this study provide an important basis for water resources utilization and ecological management in the Yongding River basin.					ping, wang/JJC-2265-2023; Wang, Hao/AAU-8730-2021	Wang, Hao/0000-0001-7594-7387; 														2073-4395				SEP	2023	13	9							2289	10.3390/agronomy13092289	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13092289													WOS:001072454200001

Hydroclimate controls over seasonal sediment yield in two ajacent High Arctic watersheds	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Interannual variations in seasonal sediment transfer in two High Arctic non-glacial watersheds were evaluated through three summers of field observations (2003-2005). Total seasonal discharge, controlled by initial watershed snow water equivalence (SWE) was the most important factor in total seasonal suspended sediment transfer. Secondary factors included melt energy, snow distribution and sediment supply. The largest pre-melt SWE of the three years studied (2004) generated the largest seasonal runoff and disproportionately greater suspended sediment yield than the other years. In contrast, 2003 and 2005 had similar SWE and total runoff, but reduced runoff intensity resulted in lower suspended sediment concentrations and lower total suspended sediment yield in 2005. Lower air temperatures at the beginning of the snowmelt period in 2003 prolonged the melt period and increased meltwater storage within the snowpack. Subsequently, peak discharge and instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations were more intense than in the otherwise warmer 2005 season. The results for this study will aid in model development for sediment yield estimation from cold regions and will contribute to the interpretation of paleoenvironmental records obtained from sedimentary deposits in lakes.

Globalization and new trade routes have amplified the spread and establishment of NNS by connecting disturbed areas worldwide. In this study, we conducted a comparative assessment of seasonal variations in amphipod communities at three southeastern Baltic Sea locations - two anthropogenically impacted and one protected habitat - to determine if native and NNS diversity differed among these habitats. Our study revealed nine amphipod species - of which two were NNS - across all three habitats. The impacted habitats had significantly higher native species richness and lower NNS abundance. Grandidierella japonica was the only NNS found at the impacted habitas. In the case of the protected habitat, NNS Gammarus tigrinus was dominant for most of the year. In autumn, dominance shifted in favour of the native Gammarus locusta and Microdeutopus cf. gryllotalpa. Grandidierella japonica was not detected there. Although anthropogenically impacted habitats may be under higher invasion risk, other environmental factors, such as salinity and temperature, may be driving the establishment pattern of NNS and the resulting community structures. Furthermore, undisturbed and/or protected habitats may be highly vulnerable to invasions due to more tolerable environmental conditions, robust NNS populations and na & iuml;ve native species to newcomers. Seasonality is an important aspect of ecological studies and must be taken into account, as omissions could potentially distort our understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems and prevent the detection of NNS.

Understanding the changes in waterbird distribution pattern in Dongting Lake and surrounding lakes is important for waterbird conservation and management. Based on six surveys during the winter period of waterbird and habitat data, we studied the changes in distribution pattern of different functional group of waterbirds between Dongting Lake and surrounding lakes and explored the effect of habitat area in Dongting Lake on waterbird distribution. The results revealed that the habitat areas within Dongting Lake are larger but less stable, whereas those in the surrounding lakes are much smaller but more stable. During regular hydrology periods, waterbirds were mainly distributed in Dongting Lake, whereas most of the diving ducks and vegetation gleaners occurred in surrounding lakes; during extreme dry periods, many waterbirds shifted to surrounding lakes (e.g., dabbling ducks and gulls). The Percentage Similarity Index (PSI) of these groups, which reflects waterbirds' distribution dynamics, exhibited negative correlations with changes in water area within Dongting Lake. The percentages of these water-dependent groups and water area in Dongting Lake exhibited a positive correlation. Water area in Dongting Lake could reflect the distribution pattern of waterbirds between Dongting Lake and surrounding lakes. Our results emphasize the importance of the overall protection of wetlands in the Dongting Lake region.

Identification of Convective Boundary Layer Depth over the Great Lakes Region Using Aircraft Observations: A Comparison of Various Methods	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This study evaluates the methods of identifying the height zi of the top of the convective boundary layer (CBL) during winter (December and January) over the Great Lakes and nearby land areas using observations taken by the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft during the Lake -Induced Convection Experiment (1997/98) and Ontario Winter Lakeeffect Systems (2013/14) field campaigns. Since CBLs facilitate vertical mixing near the surface, the most direct measurement of zi is that above which the vertical velocity turbulent fluctuations are weak or absent. Thus, we use zi from the turbulence method as the "reference value" to which zi from other methods, based on bulk Richardson number (Rib), liquid water content, and vertical gradients of potential temperature, relative humidity, and water vapor mixing ratio, are compared. The potential temperature gradient method using a threshold value of 0.015 K m21 for soundings over land and 0.011 K m21 for soundings over lake provided the estimates of zi that are most consistent with the turbulence method. The Rib threshold -based method, commonly used in numerical simulation studies, underestimated zi. Analyzing the methods' performance on the averaging window zavg we recommend using zavg 5 20 or 50 m for zi estimations for lake -effect boundary layers. The present dataset consists of both cloudy and cloudfree boundary layers, some having decoupled boundary layers above the inversion top. Because cases of decoupled boundary layers appear to be formed by nearby synoptic storms, we recommend use of the more general term, elevated mixed layers.					; Bhimireddy, Sudheer/AAA-3429-2021	Bhimireddy, Sudheer Reddy/0000-0003-4686-013X; 													1558-8424	1558-8432				MAR	2024	63	3					401	423		10.1175/JAMC-D-23-0114.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-23-0114.1													WOS:001175417000001

FEATURES OF REPRODUCTION AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT IN THE BATURA TOAD (BUFOTES BATURAE, AMPHIBIA, BUFONIDAE), THE MOST HIGH-MONTANE AMPHIBIAN IN THE FORMER USSR, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF A LABORATORY STUDY	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The Batura toad (Bufotes baturae) is a triploid species that inhabits the highlands of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. In the eastern Pamirs (the vicinity of Lake Yashilkul, Murgab Administrative Region, Republic of Tajikistan), these animals reach an altitude of 3800 m above sea-level, thus representing the most highmontane amphibian found in the former Soviet Union. At the upper limit of their distribution, B. baturae live year-round near geothermal streams, where they breed and survive during the winter. It would be interesting to learn which features of reproduction and early development could have appeared in this species in highmontane conditions. In August 2018, we captured 8 pairs of adult B. baturae from a geothermal source in the Sasyk-Bulak natural boundary on the southern bank of Lake Yashilkul, from which offspring were obtained in the spring of 2019. The body length of adult females before breeding ranged 58.28-64.17 mm, the weight 25.90-32.93 g, in males 53.69-58.75 mm and 17.73-23.92 g, respectively. The fertility of females reached 882-1850 eggs. The vitellus diameter ranged 1.18-2.19 mm. At 16.0-20.5 degrees C temperatures, the duration of egg incubation from laying to the exit of pre-larvae amounted to 2-4 days, and the total duration of embryogenesis before the start of exogenous feeding lasted 8-11 days. The total length of the body with the tail in the pre-larvae was 2.26-4.31 mm, in the larvae just started feeding, 8.73-12.64 mm. Larval development at 17.522.5 degrees C lasted 42-94 days. It is noteworthy that the larvae of the Batura toad, compared to the other species of the genus (B. sitibundus and B. viridis), are characterized by a very long tail and a black body colour persisting until metamorphosis. Young toads came out on land with body lengths of 12.98-18.85 mm. There was a relationship between the body length of young toads and the duration of larval development (r = 0.52, p = 0.05). Thus, most parameters of reproduction and early development in the Batura toad fail to differ from other species of the genus Bufotes. The low fertility of B. baturae females may be accounted for by their small size. At the same time, the authors consider the dark colour and long tail in the larvae of this species to be adaptive features for living in high-altitude flowing reservoirs.					; Artem, Kidov/V-1649-2018; Ivolga, Roman/AAD-6568-2022; Kidova, Elena A./AAW-9458-2021; Kondratova, Tatyana/AAD-6509-2022	Kidov, Artem/0000-0001-9328-2470; 													0044-5134					FEB	2022	101	2					153	164		10.31857/S0044513421120060	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044513421120060													WOS:000851040900003

It was found that the order of freezing and thawing of the lakes investigated may change from year to year. The relationship between ice cover duration and altitude is clearly weakened by variations in lake volumes, with insolation having a noticeably lesser effect. Determining the duration of ice cover of the lakes over several seasons facilitates identifying the similarities and dissimilarities between them. Five groups of lakes displaying similar characteristics were identified as well as 2 groups of lakes with highly individual characteristics. Based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that the duration of ice cover on the Tatra lakes has been shortening noticeably over the last 100 years. Small high-altitude lakes seem to be most vulnerable to climate change.					; Szypula, Bartlomiej/JOZ-7419-2023; Szypuła, Bartłomiej/JOZ-7419-2023	Gadek, Bogdan/0000-0002-8755-9119; Szypula, Bartlomiej/0000-0002-1466-0128; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2020	79	1					70	81		10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1920	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1920													WOS:000548063600006
J	Zhang, RQ; Hui, YA; Song, NP; Lv, B				Zhang, Rongqun; Hui Yuan; Song, Naiping; Lv, Bo			Study on wetland change detection and underlying causes analysis in Yinchuan plain, China	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												Wetlands are important natural resources and one of the important living environments for human, wild animals and plants. They play an important role in maintaining the balance of regional ecological and sustainable economic development. The area of wetlands in arid and semi-arid areas is the basis of the maintenance of agriculture and oasis ecosystems. In recent decades, because of climate change and the influence of human activity, wetland area is reducing quickly in Yinchuan plain. In order to improve wetland protection and management, it is a must to monitor wetland dynamic change regulation in Yinchuan plain. In this paper, wetland change information is obtained by using multi-temporal remote sensing image dataset. Research results show that lake wetland and river wetland area decrease sharply, lake wetland decreased 4349.52 hm(2) from 1978 to 2006 and river wetland decreased 12215.18 hm(2) during the same period. However, paddy wetland area increase significantly, it increased 4208.68 hm(2) during the same period. The loss and degradation of wetlands are caused by the natural factors and human activities. The earths surface humid index wetness index is falling, namely earths surface is drier and drier in Yinchuan plain. The increase of population that needs more farmland, a large number of lakes are drained to reclaim farmland for producing more food. Industrial development consumes large amounts of water resources, causing local area groundwater levels to fall. By analyzing the underlying causes and consequences of loss and degradation of wetlands, we propose a set of sufficient scientific information for improving management, protection and restoration of wetlands.					hui, yuan/KEH-5562-2024														1459-0255					APR	2010	8	2	2				1109	1111																WOS:000279103700092
J	Tang, CY; He, C; Li, YP; Acharya, K				Tang, Chunyan; He, Chao; Li, Yiping; Acharya, Kumud			Diverse responses of hydrodynamics, nutrients and algal biomass to water diversion in a eutrophic shallow lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water diversion has been increasingly applied to accelerate lake water exchange and alleviate urgent water crisis. However, effects of water diversion on water exchange and water quality for eutrophic lakes remain controversial. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-water quality-sediment diagenesis model has been developed to assess effects of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in eutrophic shallow Lake Wanghu. Results suggested that water diversion could dramatically promote water exchange and reduce residence time in most lake regions but its influence on water quality was diverse. A water transferring flow rate of 20-30 m(3)/s could reduce water age to 40-58 days during regular water diversion operation, whereas a high transferring flow rate of 100 m(3)/s was the best for emergency operation in late spring before the wet season. Moreover, nutrients and Chlorophyll-a exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity in improvement efficiency. Nutrients level in the donating system was a prerequisite to the relationship among water transport time scales, nutrients, and algal biomass in this eutrophic lake. During a clean water diversion, nutrients and algal biomass were positively associated with water age. However, when the donating system contained high level of nutrients, accumulated nutrients in the lake may still trigger algal bloom after a temporary relief due to flushing effect. Therefore, these water diversion strategies could be applied to guide a sustainable management of eutrophic Lake Wanghu in terms of transferring flow rate, wind fields, water quality in the donating system, transferring operation, and water diversion route.

Stronger winds over a large lake in response to weakening air-to-lake temperature gradient	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The impacts of climate change on the world's large lakes are a cause for concern(1-4). For example, over the past decades, mean surface water temperatures in Lake Superior, North America, have warmed faster than air temperature during the thermally stratified summer season, because decreasing ice cover has led to increased heat input(2,5). However, the effects of this change on large lakes have not been studied extensively(6). Here we analyse observations from buoys and satellites as well as model reanalyses for Lake Superior, and find that increasing temperatures in both air and surface water, and a reduction in the temperature gradient between air and water are destabilizing the atmospheric surface layer above the lake. As a result, surface wind speeds above the lake are increasing by nearly 5% per decade, exceeding trends in wind speed over land. A numerical model of the lake circulation suggests that the increasing wind speeds lead to increases in current speeds, and long-term warming causes the surface mixed layer to shoal and the season of stratification to lengthen. We conclude that climate change will profoundly affect the biogeochemical cycles of large lakes, the mesoscale atmospheric circulation at lake-land boundaries and the transport of airborne pollutants in regions that are rich in lakes.					; McKinley, Galen/IWU-5623-2023; Desai, Ankur/A-5899-2008	Austin, Jay/0000-0002-3580-1794; McKinley, Galen/0000-0002-4072-9221; Desai, Ankur/0000-0002-5226-6041													1752-0894	1752-0908				DEC	2009	2	12					855	858		10.1038/ngeo693	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo693													WOS:000272239400018

The essay's focus falls on the prominence given to the New Zealand landscape in the series and in reviews, and on Top of the Lake's apparently paradoxical combining of a narrative concern with extreme violence and performances that evoke childlike playfulness. Having examined the possibility of categorising the series as a trauma text, the essay concludes by proposing that its formal and narrative elements combine to produce a spectatorial experience that evokes potential space while triggering reparative impulses.

J	Strayer, DL; Smith, LC				Strayer, DL; Smith, LC			Macroinvertebrates of a rocky shore in the freshwater tidal Hudson River	ESTUARIES												We studied the macroinvertebrate fauna of a rocky shore in the freshwater tidal Hudson River during 1992-1994, the early years of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. The macroinvertebrate community was numerically dominated by chironomids, nematodes, oligochaetes, gastropods, zebra mussels, and planarian flatworms. The community was a mixture of species typical of stony warm water rivers and lake shores, freshwater generalists, and semiterrestrial species. Overall marroinvertebrate densities were moderate to low (2,800-14,600 m(-2)). Density was a strong function of season and elevation, with consistently low densities in the early spring and in the intertidal zone. This pattern suggests that physical harshness (alternating submergence and desiccation; ice and low temperatures) limits the distribution of invertebrates at this site. Zebra mussels occurred at our study site chiefly below the low tide mark, but only at moderate abundance (usually <1,000 m(-2)). A weak correlation between the densities of zebra mussels and those of other macroinvertebrates nonetheless suggests that the zebra mussel invasion may have affected community structure.					; Strayer, David/H-3788-2011	Strayer, David/0000-0002-6767-4486; 													0160-8347					JUN	2000	23	3					359	366		10.2307/1353328	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1353328													WOS:000088106100007

J	Kasimi, R; Preat, A				Kasimi, R; Preat, A			Eifelian-Givetian siliciclastic carbonate ramp systems .2. Cyclostratigraphy and palaeostructuration	BULLETIN DES CENTRES DE RECHERCHES EXPLORATION-PRODUCTION ELF AQUITAINE												The French-Belgian Eifelian-Givetian (E-G) transitional beds (100-250 metres thick) developed along a storm-dominated pericratonic ramp (PREAT & KASIMI, 1995). The locus of this second parr is on the small-scale cyclicity and its probable control by Milankovitch forced sea-level oscillations. These E-G layers consist of ten types (cycles 1 to 10) of 5(th) order upward-shallowing cycles (1 to 15 metres thick), Cycle durations calculated along the ramp profile are between 17 and 53 ky and about 35 ky on average, The cycles are ;symmetric and can be grouped into three major types: deep subtidal (cycles 1 to 3), shallow subtidal (cycles 4 to 8) and peritidal cycles (cycles 9 and 3) which are genetically related and constitute a continuous series along the ramp profile. Deep subtidal cycles consist of basinal argillites deposited below storm wave base, overlain by storm-deposited line-grained siltstones and shelly limestones; shallow subtidal cycles consist of stacked skeletal packstone/grainstone deposits and reefal floatstone/rudstone biostromes Peritidal cycles are composed oi very shallow subtidal to intertidal semi-restricted algal/calcisphaerid/ostracod fenestral wackestones and laminites. The latter oi these display millimetre-thick laminations formed by algal binding of thin storm layers. The 5(th) order cycles display the same stacking pattern within the six studied profiles end record an overall regressive prograding depositional sequence. These 5(th) order cycles are stacked to form several 4(th) order parasequence sets allowing definition of a regional third-order sequence of type 2 (sensu VAIL et al,, 1991). The overall characteristics oi these 5(th) order cycles i.e., 1) large lateral extension; 2) pronounced asymmetry; 3) average duration between 17 and 53 ky; 4) a 1:5 bundling within the 4(th) order parasequence sets; 5) a simultaneous development of subtidal and peritidal cycles, suggest a Milankovitch type climatic-eustatic control. The 1:5 recurrence ratio of metre-scale cycles within the megacycles could represent the precession signal modulated by the short eccentricity signal. These eustatic sea-level fluctuations which are in accordance with the Milankovitch frequencies during the non-glacial E/G period may be associated with lake and/or underground aquifer volume variations. Systematic changes in the stacking patterns of the 5(th) order cycles are used in conjunction with Fischer plots to define long-term sea-level changes, i.e, to define the 3(rd) order depositional sequence associated to the E/G transitional series, The E/G shelf margin systems tract (SMST) followed a long-term sea-level highstand (HST, cycles 1 to 3) and developed during a rapid sea-level fall (type-2 sequence boundary), followed by a long-term lowstand systems tract (cycles 4 to 10), The absence of any subaerial erosion err karstification indicates that the sea-level fall was not important and did not exceed the subsidence rate. The absence oi emersion features, particularly within the crinoidal and reefal buildups suggests that the amplitude of the sea-level fall was less than 20-25 metres during the E/G transition, Based on conodont zonation, the duration of the lowstand systems tract was approximately 700 ky, so the relative sea-level fall can be estimated to have been between 3 and 3.5 cm/1000 y. This value is in the range of the tectono-eustatic sea-level fluctuations.																			0396-2687					JUN 29	1996	20	1					61	90																WOS:A1996VP66600003

Lipid Profile of the Freshwater Pearl Mussel Margaritifera margaritifera Inhabiting Different Biotopes of the Lake-River System of the Kem River, White Sea Basin	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera is considered to be the most rapidly declining species of freshwater bivalve, whereas its colonies in rivers of the White Sea Basin remain the most numerous in the world. The lipid profiles of mantle, muscle (foot), and digestive gland tissues of the freshwater pearl mussel from the Kem, Ukhta, and Vozhma Rivers in autumn (end of September, early October) were studied using high performance thin-layer chromatography. The highest total lipid [TL] content was found in the digestive gland. Cholesterol esters, non-esterified fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol were the dominant lipids in all studied tissues. The reduced triacylglycerol content in the mussels was associated with its utilization during the spawning period. The colony of the freshwater pearl mussel inhabiting the Vozhma River was distinguished by higher TL content in the mantle and digestive gland. Data on the size-age characteristics of mollusks from the Kem, Ukhta, and Vozhma Rivers and the relationship between the structural and storage lipid content and size-age parameters are discussed. The results are important for different conservation strategies of endangered species, such as the freshwater pearl mussel, especially in ecological monitoring based on evaluation of the physiological and biochemical state of mollusks and rare natural colonies.					; Pekkoeva, Svetlana/AAV-1871-2021; Voronin, Viktor/HPH-2723-2023; Efremov, Denis/O-2226-2016; Murzina, Svetlana/A-7624-2014; Ieshko, Evgeny/N-8331-2019; Fokina, Natalia/A-5903-2014	Khurtina (Pekkoeva), Svetlana/0000-0001-8706-731X; Voronin, Viktor/0000-0002-4265-8850; Murzina, Svetlana/0000-0002-9705-2741; Fokina, Natalia/0000-0002-1209-3019														1424-2818				FEB	2023	15	2							293	10.3390/d15020293	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15020293													WOS:000939056300001
J	Griffiths, SJ; Street-Perrott, FA; Holmes, JA; Leng, MJ; Tzedakis, C				Griffiths, SJ; Street-Perrott, FA; Holmes, JA; Leng, MJ; Tzedakis, C			Chemical and isotopic composition of modern water bodies in the Lake Kopais Basin, central Greece: analogues for the interpretation of the lacustrine sedimentary sequence	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Stable-isotope measurements and modem aquatic chemistry are used to aid the reconstruction of past hydrological changes recorded in a 126 ka-long sediment core from Lake Kopais. Greece, This is the most southeasterly European site m,with a long Late Quaternary sequence. Although the lake has been artificially drained, calcareous sediments from the centre of the basin, 38degrees26'16N, 23degrees03'01E, provide a continuous record from the early part of the last interglacial to the Early Holocene. Because the physiography and hydrology are complex, modem analogues for past environmental conditions are essential. The modem waters are of Ca-Mg-HCO3 or Mg-Ca-HCO3 type, reflecting the prevalence of limestones and metamorphic rocks in the catchment. They show a clear evolutionary trend in delta(18)O and deltaD values from the source areas to the modem lakes. However, the modem water bodies are less evolved than the palaeolake. A larger evaporating surface, higher values of delta(18)O in precipitation, decreased precipitation/evaporation ratios and hydrological closure increased the delta(18)O values of endogenic carbonates at different times in the past, However, Palaeolake Kopais never desiccated completely or became saline. Analyses of the organic fraction from the core show that: (i) it is mainly of algal origin; (ii) productivity and carbon cycling in the lake waters,Were relatively, stable through time; and (iii) the bulk delta(13)C values vary between - 29parts per thousand and - 25parts per thousand, indicating that the lake waters were never appreciably carbon-limited and that C-4 plants did not invade the catchment. Although significant shifts in the delta(18)O and delta(13)C values of endogenic low-Mg calcite are attributable mainly to past variations in water balance, weak delta(18)O-delta(13)C covariance during marine isotope stages (MIS) 5e-5c suggests that the palaeolake leaked significantly through karstic sinkholes. Since it was effectively operating as an open system, delta(18)O may have retained the isotopic imprint of increased summer precipitation. Between MIS 5a and MIS 4, strong isotopic covariance suggests minimal outflow and drier conditions than today. After an increase in winter snowmelt during MIS 3, the climate again became cold and dry in the full-glacial (MIS 2). A fluctuating increase in moisture occurred during the late-glacial to early Holocene transition (MIS 2 - 1).

Unanticipated Geochemical and Microbial Community Structure under Seasonal Ice Cover in a Dilute, Dimictic Arctic Lake	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Despite most lakes in the Arctic being perennially or seasonally frozen for at least 40% of the year, little is known about microbial communities and nutrient cycling under ice cover. We assessed the vertical microbial community distribution and geochemical composition in early spring under ice in a seasonally ice-covered lake in southwest Greenland using amplicon-based sequencing that targeted 16S rRNA genes and using a combination of field and laboratory aqueous geochemical methods. Microbial communities changed consistently with changes in geochemistry. Composition of the abundant members responded strongly to redox conditions, shifting downward from a predominantly heterotrophic aerobic community in the suboxic waters to a heterotrophic anaerobic community in the anoxic waters. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Sporichthyaceae, Comamonadaceae, and the SAR11 Clade had higher relative abundances above the oxycline and OTUs within the genus Methylobacter, the phylum Lentisphaerae, and purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) below the oxycline. Notably, a 13-fold increase in sulfide at the oxycline was reflected in an increase and change in community composition of potential sulfur oxidizers. Purple non-sulfur bacteria were present above the oxycline and green sulfur bacteria and PSB coexisted below the oxycline, however, PSB were most abundant. For the first time we show the importance of PSB as potential sulfur oxidizers in an Arctic dimictic lake.

The median total organic carbon (TOC) in these boreal lakes was 7.8 mg l(-1), the median total inorganic carbon (TIC) 1.6 mg l(-1) and the median partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) 900 mu atm. When the data was divided into subgroups according to land use in the catchment, the proportion of TIC of the total carbon (TC) in lakes was highest (31%) in agricultural areas and lowest (10%) in peatland areas. Elevated TIC concentrations were associated with agricultural land in the catchment, whereas elevated TOC concentrations were observed in lakes with high peatland proportion in the catchment. Two contrasting important sources of CO2 in lakes were identified on the basis of statistical analysis of the data; weathering processes in the catchments and decomposition of organic matter. CO2 was also strongly associated with total nutrients TN and TP, implying the importance of quality of organic matter and availability of nutrients for the decomposition processes.					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020	Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2008	91	2-3					151	162		10.1007/s10533-008-9266-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-008-9266-8													WOS:000262503700004

Furthermore, the impacts of these hydroclimatic changes on ancient civilizations across various regions of eastern China have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we utilize precisely dated multi-proxy stalagmite records from Yuwang Cave to reveal the temporal and spatial variations of hydroclimate in central-south China during 6.0-4.0 ka BP, as well as to unravel potential impacts of these changes on the development of late Neolithic cultures in the middle Yangtze Basin. The records indicate that there was an increasing trend in stalagmite delta O-18 values from similar to 6.0 ka BP to 4.0 ka BP, suggesting that an evident decline in summer monsoon intensity occurred. In contrast to delta O-18, the delta C-13 values remained relatively stable during 6.0-4.5 ka BP but abruptly increased and sustained higher levels during 4.5-4.2 ka BP before experiencing a dramatic decrease with lower values during 4.2-4.0 ka BP; growth rates and Mg/Ca ratios exhibited synchronous changes alongside delta C-13, indicating significant shifts in dry-wet conditions throughout central-south China during the transition of mid-to-late Holocene. Notably, the drier yet more stable climatic phase between 4.5 and 4.2 ka BP coincided closely with the flourishing of the Shijiahe Culture in the middle Yangtze Basin - providing new evidence that declining monsoonal rainfall may have facilitated the expansion of late Neolithic settlements in lowland areas of the Basin around the 4.2 ka event. Taking robust geological records from other parts of eastern China together, we found that the hydroclimatic pattern of eastern China during 4.5-4.2 ka BP did not conform to dipole nor tripole modes; rather it exhibited a more complex pattern characterized by "dry conditions prevailing in both middle-lower Yangtze Basin and North China, while the middlelower Yellow River Basin alongside Southeastern China experienced wetness".

In Paul Lake [Michigan, USA] the reference ecosystem, pigment sedimentation showed no significant interannual differences. In Tuesday Lake, fish manipulations in May 1985 changed the zooplankton from an assemblage of Bosmina and small cyclopoids to one of large cladoceran grazers. Sedimentation of pigments, especially the grazing indicator pheophorbide a, increased significantly as the grazer assemblage changed. Mean grazer size was positively related to pheophorbide deposition rate in both lakes. Results of this whole-lake experiment indicate that major changes in lake food webs alter pigment deposition rates.

Hospital electronic medical record-based public health surveillance system deployed during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL												Background: Several computer biosurveillance systems are in place to detect events of public health (PH) significance; however, most lack access to timely and detailed patient-level data and investigation of alerts places a strain on PH resources. Methods: Hospital-based infection control professionals led a multi-disciplinary team to develop a computer rule-based system that relies on the patient's electronic medical record. The rules operated on HL7 messages transmitted by clinical computing systems and encompassed a variety of types of patient-level data, including laboratory test ordering and results, radiology ordering and reports, emergency room and outpatient clinic visits, and hospital admissions. Laboratory data were mapped to standard vocabularies, and radiology data were processed using natural language-processing algorithms before the rules were applied to filter for events of PH interest. For each rule, statistical process controls were applied to generate alerts when levels exceeded two standard deviations above the mean. The system was deployed at a large hospital in Salt Lake City during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, and it was accessed 3 times a day to perform surveillance. Daily reports were provided to local PH agencies after preliminary investigation of the alerts. Results: Of the 24 rules monitored, 9 generated alerts on I I different occasions. The only significant event of PH interest that was noted during the surveillance period was an increase in influenza during the Games. The positive predictive value of the rules varied with a high value (89 %) noted for identification of pneumonia from chest radiograph reports by natural language-processing algorithms. Conclusions: With the assistance of a novel computer-based surveillance system linked to the electronic medical record that uses objective, quantifiable events and access to patient data, infection control practitioners could play a front-line role in biosurveillance and facilitate bidirectional communication with PH agencies.

A register was compiled, containing a broad set of data from 644 Swedish lakes. The median Cs-137 concentration in fish increased between 1986 and 1987 by between 13% (trout) and 240% (pike). The increase between 1987 and 1988 has stagnated for most species, but not for pike where the concentration increased 82% in 'the median lake'. The in-lake, between-lake and temporal variations are large and differ from species to species. About 14 000 lakes in Sweden had fish ('100 g perch') with Cs-137 concentrations above 1500 Bq/kg (w/w) (the Swedish guideline) during the autumn of 1987. Apart from the radioactive fallout, the water retention time is the individual factor of greatest importance for the variability of Cs-137 concentration in fish between these lakes - longer water retention time gives higher Cs-137 concentrations in fish. Lake water hardness and/or conductivity also influence the uptake of Cs-137 in fish - lakes with high values of these parameters tend to have lower concentrations of Cs-137 in fish.																			0265-931X						1992	15	3					207	229		10.1016/0265-931X(92)90059-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0265-931X(92)90059-3													WOS:A1992HA96200002
J	Das, B				Das, Biswarup			"My Heart is sore": Rethinking the Human Condition Through Yeats's "The Wild Swans at Coole"	COMPARATIVE LITERATURE-EAST & WEST												This article probes into W. B. Yeats's 1917 poem "The Wild Swans at Coole" to illumine how sorrow becomes an ineluctable trait of human experience. In the poem, a fictitious visitor to Coole Park articulates his feelings on descrying fifty-nine wild swans on the lake on an autumn evening. He finds the spectacle of the effervescent creatures amidst the beauty of nature pretty delightful. Concurrently, however, the same spectacle makes him dejected. Considering the French thinker Jean-Paul Sartre's theory of matter and consciousness, this article will convey how, in essence, the visitor's anguish is twofold, and how it is the consequence of his act of relating the spectacle of the swans to external factors. The article will also reveal how the visitor's sorrow points to that of humanity in general. The conclusion will be drawn by assessing whether an escape from the twofold anguish of the visitor is possible.

J	Hart, RC; Wragg, PD				Hart, Rob C.; Wragg, Peter D.			Recent blooms of the dinoflagellate Ceratium in Albert Falls Dam (KZN): History, causes, spatial features and impacts on a reservoir ecosystem and its zooplankton	WATER SA												A lake-wide bloom of the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella, discovered in Albert Falls Dam in October 2006, exposed a significant ecological change indicative of reduced water quality in this historically mesotrophic reservoir. The spatial distribution of the bloom was examined synoptically in October 2006 and January 2007; these surveys revealed generally higher dinoflagellate densities in inshore reaches of the lake, and especially in the discharge plume of the inflowing Mgeni River. Ceratium totally dominated the phytoplankton assemblage, accounting almost completely for coincident chlorophyll levels, which generally increased with depth to generate a 'deep' chlorophyll maximum. Vertical oxygen profiles during the bloom differed substantially from corresponding profiles during non-bloom conditions historically typical in this reservoir. Direct count data and ordination analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling exposed marked changes in zooplankton community structure compared to seasonally congruent non-bloom conditions in other years. Changes included the effective replacement of Moina by Bosmina, substantial reductions in Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia, and smaller but definite increases in abundance especially of calanoid copepods, as well as cyclopoid copepods and of Chaoborus, although not all of these differences were apparent in both survey months. These compositional changes are attributable to intrinsic differences in feeding biology among taxa and their associated susceptibility to the altered food environment, which was commensurate with Ceratium's emergence. In addition, chydorid cladocerans appeared as a new (but spatially restricted) eutrophic bio-indicator component of the zooplankton, and the species diversity of cyclopoid copepods was enriched. The historical incidence of Ceratium in the lake since 1995 coincided with low NO3-N:TP values (used here as an N:P ratio proxy), particularly of inflow waters, and with broadly coincident values in the open lake. Ceratium was present but sparse in 1995, at average N:P ratios around 5.5. It disappeared in 1996 when the ratio increased radically to >10, and reappeared in 2004 after an erratic decline of the ratio to < 5 in the lake. The decline in N:P ratio of inflow waters since 1996 was clearly associated with a consistent rise in TP levels in inflows, most plausibly attributable to inputs of (Howick) wastewater treatment (WWT) plant origin. The appearance of Ceratium blooms is accordingly related to progressive elevations in mean annual P concentrations in inflows from similar to 40 mu g/l in 1995 to 120 mu g/l in 2007 (broadly mirrored in annual I'll loadings), suggesting that improved operational efficiency (and capacity) of the WWT plant offers a plausible prospect for mitigation and reversal.

Internal loading in stormwater ponds as a phosphorus source to downstream waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												We assessed the prevalence and causes of sediment phosphorus (P) release within urban stormwater ponds, a process that may reduce P removal by sedimentation. Data collected from surface water of 98 urban stormwater ponds in Minnesota showed that nearly 40% had median summer total P concentrations in excess of average stormwater runoff (0.38 mg L-1), implying effects of internal loading. We sampled seven ponds more intensively and found four were strongly stratified with persistent hypolimnetic anoxia, despite mean depths <2 m. Sediment core incubations revealed that, unlike in most lakes, both labile organic P (NaOH minus persulfate extractions) and redox-sensitive P (NH4Cl and Na2S2O4 extractions) contribute to P release. Together, these analyses suggest P accumulated in stormwater ponds is highly susceptible to internal release and potentially contributes to downstream eutrophication. Understanding how frequently these conditions occur and how they affect different P forms is vital to improving pond design and management.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011; Taguchi, Vinicius/GPX-9205-2022; Gulliver, John/AAJ-8757-2020	Taguchi, Vinicius/0000-0001-5888-6738; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030; Natarajan, Poornima/0000-0001-9506-8371; 														2378-2242				AUG	2020	5	4					322	330		10.1002/lol2.10155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10155		APR 2020											WOS:000529495500001

The freshwater snail species known as Viviparus contectus (Viviparidae: Gastropoda) is one that people eat. Here, the levels of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, As, Zn, and Cu) in water and V. contectus samples were determined. An Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, Spectro Arcos, vertical plasma) was used for the analysing the heavy metal concentrations in water and freshwater snail samples. The results of the current investigation demonstrated that freshwater snails accumulated metals in their water and soft tissues in the following orders: Pb > Cr = Zn = Cu = Cd = As and Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd > As = Cr. Autumn was the time of year when higher amounts of heavy metals (As, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Hg) were found. Pb content in the freshwater snail samples was strongly impacted by seasonal fluctuations (P 0.05). For adults, the EDI (estimated daily intake) values were lower than the TDI (tolerable daily intake) values, and the HI (hazard index) values were below 1. Freshwater snail samples had Zn and Pb levels that were over the FAO/WHO, Turkish Food Codex, JECFA, and EC limit values. Except for Pb, the water study shows mean metal concentrations below the USEPA, Turkish Pollution Control Regulation, and World Health Organisation maximum allowed levels. Aquatic ecosystems were negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities overall, and this study can provide a helpful data set for investigations on metallic contamination in water bodies and biomonitoring in freshwater ecosystems.

Available summer-temperature reconstructions for the mid- to late Eemian transition show decreasing values during that time. We present a new chironomid record from southern Germany that covers the mid-Eemian to the end of the first Wurmian stadial (c. 125-105 ka) and also parts of the late Rissian glaciation and early Brorup interstadial of the early Wurmian glaciation. Based on this record we describe lake development in the former Furamoos palaeolake and quantitatively reconstruct July air temperature during the examined interval. Late Rissian sediments are dominated by two chironomid taxa, Sergentia coracina-type and Micropsectra radialis-type, indicating very cold conditions. Following an uncertain interval, probably including a hiatus at the late Rissian/Eemian transition, mid-Eemian sediments contain Tanytarsus glabrescens-type and Tanytarsus mendax-type suggesting relatively high July air temperatures. During the late Eemian, typically thermophilic taxa such as Tanytarsus glabrescens-type disappear, suggesting decreasing temperatures. Stadial A is associated with increases in Microtendipes pedellus-type suggesting more oligotrophic conditions. Early Brorup sediments contain Tanytarsus glabrescens-type, suggesting a slight increase in July air temperature. Reconstructed July air temperatures show temperatures of 7-8 degrees C during the late Rissian and a decline from similar to 15.5-12 degrees C during the mid- to late Eemian associated with decreasing Northern Hemisphere July insolation. July air temperature values vary between 12 and 14 degrees C in the late Eemian, while reconstructed temperatures remain within 12-13.5 degrees C during Stadial A. Our new chironomid-based temperature reconstruction provides valuable corroboration and new quantification of temperature development from the mid-Eemian to the early Brorup interstadial as well as for sections of the late Rissian from the alpine foreland of southern Germany.

J	Xu, YY; Zhang, M; Wang, L; Kong, LH; Cai, QH				Xu, Yaoyang; Zhang, Min; Wang, Lan; Kong, Linghui; Cai, Qinghua			Changes in water types under the regulated mode of water level in Three Gorges Reservoir, China	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The creation of a reservoir is often the most serious impact of damming on upstream river ecosystems, which may cause the dramatic change of water types. A giant subtropical reservoir (Three Gorges Reservoir, TGR) formed by the construction of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has experienced three impoundment stages. According to the combined classification criterion of reservoir water quality management, a study of monthly change of water types was conducted in the mainstream and Xiangxi Bay of TGR from Jun. 2003 to Dec. 2009. Due to the rise of water level from the first stage to the last stage of impoundment, dramatic changes of water types were found during non-flood season for the mainstream, and during most months of the year for Xiangxi Bay. Under the planned mode of water operation, the mainstream would still be characterized by full mixing during the season of algal growth, which prevents the development of algal blooms, even though it experiences extreme drought events. However, Xiangxi Bay is characterized as a stable system similar to natural lakes (e.g., thermal stratification), which may contribute to the development of algal blooms, especially in years of extreme drought.

J	Kellman, M				Kellman, M			Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) establishment in boreal forest:: results of a transplantation experiment	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To evaluate whether seedlings of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) can establish beyond the species northern range limit in adjacent boreal forest. Location The hardwood-boreal forest transition zone on the north-east shore of Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada. Methods Seed fall of sugar maple was monitored for 5 years in a stand of this species at its northern range limit, and seed from this stand was transplanted to five micro-habitat types in an adjacent boreal forest. The establishment and survival of sugar maple seedlings there, and in the seed-source stand, was monitored for the following 7-11 years. Soil-surface light levels were measured in both forest types. Results Most seed fell in the final year of monitoring, when c. 250 seeds m(-2) were recorded. First-year seedling establishment rates in the maple stand, deriving from this mast seed year, was approximately double that deriving from seed transplanted to the boreal forest sites; this is tentatively attributed to seed predator satiation in the maple stand. However, subsequent seedling survivorship in the boreal forest was greater than that in the maple stand, resulting in comparable seedling densities by the end of 6 years. This difference is tentatively attributed to better illumination in the boreal forest sites, and canopy-opening disturbances appear to be especially facilitative of seedling survival. Main conclusions There is no fundamental impediment to sugar maple seedlings establishing in boreal forest communities if climate warming occurs and seed is available. If management intervention is needed to accelerate seed availability in a rapidly warming boreal forest, then diffuse seed application to disturbed boreal forest sites during mast years of local boreal tree species is recommended as the most effective way of avoiding seed predation and increasing seedling survival.																			0305-0270					SEP	2004	31	9					1515	1522		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01128.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01128.x													WOS:000223495000007

We documented large fluctuations in fish abundance over a 60-d survey period by conducting repeated snorkeling surveys within 16 reaches and 82 individual habitat units in a 2-km segment of the Onion River, Wisconsin. Fish densities in reaches were more stable than those within individual habitat units. Moreover, temporal trends in fish abundance were correlated strongly with the physical features of reaches but not with those of individual habitat units. In focusing on fine-scale changes in fish distribution, we uncovered three general patterns of movement within this stream. The first was associated with flood events, which caused the downstream displacement of large numbers of fish (up to 80% loss from individual pools). The second was the upstream recolonization of fish into depleted pools during the intervening periods of low flow, and the third was smallscale movement within reaches. Three separate floods did not cause a decline in average pool densities over the study; however, there was a strong shift away from glide habitats and a concentration of fish in the middle reaches of the stream by the study's conclusion. Movement of the type and magnitude described here has clear implications for the association of fish with physical habitat conditions. We also speculate that such movement may have effects on social hierarchies and the relative fitness of individual coho salmon.

The wide occurrence of small eddy structures on the lake surface is revealed during the warm period of the year. In total, 496 surface eddies with an average diameter of 2 km are registered. More than 90% of the recorded eddies belong to the submesoscale variability range. Cyclonic rotation is typical of 84% of the structures. A seasonal maximum of eddy activity is registered during the stable stratification over most of Lake Ladoga. The eddies occur most frequently to the north and northeast of the Valaam Island in areas similar to 100 m deep but close to the seabed unevenness. During the spring thermocline, the eddies are often registered from the cold side of the frontal boundary indicating their important contribution to the water exchange and mixing processes.

The key features of the bottom sediment composition in the anoxic Lake Mogil'noe	OCEANOLOGY												In the summer 2006, integrated geological, geochemical, hydrological, and hydrochemical studies were performed on the relict anoxic Lake Mogil'noe (down to 16 m depths) located on Kil'din Island in the Barents Sea. The chemical and grain-size composition of the bottom sediments were compared for the lake (a permanently anoxic basin) and the Baltic Sea Deeps (periodically anoxic basins). The vertical location of the hydrogen sulfide layer boundary in the lake (9-11 m depths) was practically the same from 1974 up to now. The concentrations of suspended particulate matter in the lake in June and July 2006 appeared to be close to its summer concentrations in the seawaters of the open part of the Baltic Sea. The mud from Lake Mogil'noe compared to those of the Baltic Sea Deeps are characterized by fluid and flake consistency and by pronounced admixtures of sandy and silty fractions probably of eolic origin. The lacustrine mud contain much plant remains; iron sulfides and vivanite were also found in ooze. The concentrations of 22 elements determined in the lacustrine bottom sediments were of the same levels as those found here 33 years ago. The concentrations also appeared to be close to those in the corresponding grain-size types of the bottom sediments in the Baltic Sea. The low C(org)/N value (5% on average) in the mud of Mogil'noe Lake compared to the values for the mud of the Baltic Sea Deeps (10% on average) points to the considerable planktogenic component in the organic matter composition of the lacustrine mud. No indications were reveled for anthropogenic contaminations of the lacustrine bottom sediments with toxic metals.

J	Houck, KJ; Lockley, MG				Houck, KJ; Lockley, MG			Life in an active volcanic arc: Petrology and sedimentology of dinosaur track beds in the Jindong Formation (Cretaceous), Gyeongsang Basin, South Korea	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												The Jindong Formation was deposited as a thick succession of fine-grained volcaniclastic sediments in a rapidly subsiding intra-arc basin. These sediments contain abundant dinosaur and bird tracks that Occur on many bedding planes throughout the approximately 110 m of stratigraphic section measured for this study. The main lithologies in the Jindong Formation are ash-rich mudstone, siltstone, and very fine sandstone. Minor lithologies are coarser sandstone, conglomerate, carbonates. and ash tuff. The sandstones are feldspathic and lithic arenites and wackes. They contain plutonic feldspars, volcanic rock fragments, volcanic ash, and a variety of quartz types. All litholqies show evidence of extensive post-depositional alteration, including, devitrification and replacement of detrital grains by authigenic minerals. The alterations are typical of burial metamorphism with high heat flow. Sediments of the Jindong Formation can be grouped into three facies associations. Association I (proximal) comprises 16% of the measured sections. It consists of various types of bedded, cross-bedded, laminated, and ripple cross-laminated sandstone and minor conglomerate. These are interpreted as fluvial or distributary channel and proximal lake deposits. Association 2 (media]) comprises 53% of the measured sections. It consists mainly of heterolithic couplets of very fine sandstone and mudstone that are mm to dm thick. They contain graded bedding, laminations, current ripples, wave ripples, and mud cracks, and are interpreted as lacustrine hyperpycnal flow deposits. Association 3 (distal) comprises 31% of the measured sections. It consists mainly of bedded shale, mudstone, and siltstone. These are interpreted as distal lake deposits. Associations 2 and 3 contain minor carbonates, which are interpreted as lacustrine and/or diagenetic in origin, and minor tuffs, which are interpreted as tephra. Small wave ripples, dinosaur tracks, invertebrate burrows, and mud cracks are common throughout the measured sections; thus the Jindong lakes are inferred to have been shallow and ephemeral in nature. Wave ripple-crest orientations are consistently WNW-ESE, indicating a prevailing wind direction from the NNE or SSW. Because the sediments are mostly fine-grained and the ash beds thin, the study area is inferred to have been in a distal lowland setting, at least tens of km away from erupting volcanoes. Paleoclimate reconstructions suggest that the study area had a seasonal climate with wet summers and dry winters. Cooler, wetter conditions are thought to have prevailed to the north, and warmer, drier conditions to the south. Modern volcanic arc environments with seasonal and/or humid climates are characterized by rapid aggradation of ashy sediment that fills drainages and causes widespread flooding. This style of sedimentation accounts for the facies found in the Jindong Formation, as well as the many bedding-plane exposures of tracks. The unusual occurrence of both sauropod and ornithopod tracks in the Jindong sections may be the result of a climate boundary that existed in the area at the time. Facies analysis of track types indicates that various track makers had the same environmental preferences, and facies association 2 contains the greatest number of tracks of all types. It is inferred that the tendency for only one track type to occur on a given bedding plane is the result of different types of animals visiting the study area at different times, rather than differing environmental preferences. The Jindong Formation contains an abundance of subaqueously deposied facies, an abundance of tracks, and many track levels that were wet when animals were walking on them. These features are not consistent with previous interpretations of aridity during Jindong time. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jana, S; Paul, AK				Jana, Subrata; Paul, Ashis Kumar			Chronological evolution of the channel functional units in association with palaeo-hydrogeomorphological environment in the ancient delta fan of Subarnarekha basin, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The assessment of chronological evolution of the channel functional units is an imperative aspect to understand the channel avulsion nature and planform change. In this study, the channel functional units (channel, aggradational and abandoned) and their distinct micro-morphologies have been assessed through the landuse and landcover classification, terrain analysis, lithostratigraphic records and fluctuating flow regimes in the ancient delta fan of the Subarnarekha basin. The distinct micro-morphological features of the functional units have been formed and evolved under the dominance of fluvial environment coupled with the fluctuating strength of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and regression phase of sea-level since 6000 years before present (YBP). However, the borehole lithostratigraphic records reveal that the ancient delta fan was formed under the different fluvio-marine depositional environments of the marine transgression, regression and stillstand phases since 32,200 YBP. The riverbed of the recent course is ascended than the palaeo-courses due to declining trends of water discharge and sediment load in the last four decades as well as during the late Holocene mega-drought event. The channel unit and abandoned unit have been transformed into the aggradational unit with micro-morphologies of point bar, fill-terrace, and natural levee under the influence of channel avulsion and bulk of sediment deposition related to the fluctuating flow regime and base level of erosion. The micro-morphological features (marshes, oxbow lakes and meander neck-cuts) of the abandoned unit have been modified from the channel unit after diversion of the recent course from the palaeo-course owing to extreme discharge and valley drowning during lowstand.					; Jana, Subrata/AGZ-3871-2022	Jana, Subrata/0000-0002-1760-7699; Paul, Ashis Kumar/0000-0001-9993-0969													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN 28	2020	79	13								10.1007/s12665-020-09093-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09093-1													WOS:000545997300003

The reason of this peculiarity is an abundance of 4 species of charophytes (Chara aculeolata, C. aspera, C. contraria and C. tomentosa) which dominate the submerged vegetation of the lake and yielded 417 g m-2 dry biomass in summer 1991. The plants have high potential for phosphorus uptake and accumulation as was checked in laboratory experiments. Due to this potential Chara can outcompete planktonic algae in mixed cultures at different mineral P supplies.

J	Krausman, PR				Krausman, Paul R.			Ruffed Grouse population ecology in the Appalachian region	WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS												The Appalachian Cooperative Grouse Research Project (ACGRP) was a multistate cooperative effort initiated in 1996 to investigate the apparent decline of ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) and improve management throughout the central and southern Appalachian region (i.e., parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina, USA). Researchers have offered several hypotheses to explain the low abundance of ruffed grouse in the region, including low availability of early-successional forests due to changes in land use, additive harvest mortality, low productivity and recruitment, and nutritional stress. As part of the ACGRP, we investigated ruffed grouse population ecology. Our objectives were to estimate reproductive rates, estimate survival and cause-specific mortality rates, examine if ruffed grouse harvest in the Appalachian region is compensatory, and estimate ruffed grouse finite population growth. We trapped > 3,000 ruffed grouse in autumn (Sep-Nov) and spring (Feb-Mar) from 1996 to September 2002 on 12 study areas. We determined the age and gender of each bird and fitted them with necklace-style radiotransmitters and released them at the trap site. We tracked ruffed grouse >= 2 times per week using handheld radiotelemetry equipment and gathered data on reproduction, recruitment, survival, and mortality. Ruffed grouse population dynamics in the Appalachian region differed from the central portion of the species' range (i.e., northern United States and Canada). Ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region had lower productivity and recruitment, but higher survival than reported for populations in the Great Lakes region and southern Canada. Population dynamics differed between oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) and mixed-mesophytic forest associations within the southern and central Appalachian region. Productivity and recruitment were lower in oak-hickory forests, but adult survival was higher than in mixed-mesophytic forests. Furthermore, ruffed grouse productivity and recruitment were more strongly related to hard mast (i.e., acorn) production in oak-hickory forests than in mixed-mesophytic forests. The leading cause of ruffed grouse mortality was avian predation (44% of known mortalities). Harvest mortality accounted for 12% ofall known mortalities and appeared to be compensatory. Population models indicated ruffed grouse populations in the Appalachian region are declining (lambda = 0.7-0.95), but differences in model estimates highlighted the need for improved understanding of annual productivity and recruitment. We posit ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region exhibit a clinal population structure characterized by changes in life-history strategies. Changes in life history strategies are in response to gradual changes in forest structure, quality of food resources, snowfall and accumulation patterns, and predator communities. Management efforts should focus on creating a mosaic of forest stand ages across the landscape to intersperse habitat resources including nesting and brood cover, adult escape cover, roosting sites, and, most importantly, food resources. Land managers can intersperse habitat resources through a combination of clearcutting, shelterwood harvests, group selection, and timber stand improvement (including various thinnings and prescribed fire). Managers should maintain current ruffed grouse harvest rates while providing high quality hunting opportunities. We define high quality hunting as low hunting pressure, low vehicle traffic, and high flush rates. Managers ca provide high quality hunting opportunities through use of road closures in conjunction with habitat management.					; Krausman, Paul/HTN-2759-2023	Devers, Patrick/0000-0002-5281-6875; 													0084-0173	1938-5455				JUN	2007		168					1	36		10.2193/0084-0173.168	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0084-0173.168													WOS:000247213100001

They and their ice cover period have been studied extensively as indicators on climate variations e.g. by Assel and Robertson (1995) and Wynne et. al. (1996). In Finland these issues, specially connected to lake Kallavesi have been studied by Simojoki (1940a, 1940b, 1956), Ruosteenoja (1986) and Kuusisto (1994). Description of lakes with physically based models is well advanced although in many occasions the complexity of the problem sets demands for the models used. In this study long climate time series from one station in central Finland were used to simulate thermal features of lakes in the surroundings. The data series describe both annual and diurnal variation. Lake Kallavesi was selected to be the target lake. The lake was modeled with a temperature model. Simulated ice covered period and water temperature were compared to observed and measured values to get a sight about the obtainable results. With this kind of long and abundant material one can expect to gain a lot of useful knowledge about physically based modeling and coupling of climate and lake models in various scales, considering also the morphometry of the lake. The statistical features can also be seen better, including more rare events. Attention can also be paid to milder winter periods, when the ice cover may be incomplete for a relatively long period. This benefits also the studies about the effects of the warming climate, and lakes in boundary regions, where ice cover does not form every winter.																									1998							597	604																WOS:000078339600061
J	Huo, YL; Peltier, WR; Chandan, D				Huo, Yiling; Peltier, William Richard; Chandan, Deepak			Mid-Holocene climate of the Tibetan Plateau and hydroclimate in three major river basins based on high-resolution regional climate simulations	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The Tibetan Plateau (TP) contains the headwaters of major Asian rivers that sustain billions of people and plays an important role in both regional and global climate through thermal and mechanical forcings. Understanding the characteristics and changes to the hydrological regimes on the TP during the mid-Holocene (MH) will help in understanding the expected future changes. Here, an analysis of the hydroclimates over the headwater regions of three major rivers originating in the TP, namely the Yellow, Yangtze, and Brahmaputra rivers, is presented, using dynamically downscaled climate simulations constructed using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) coupled to the hydrological model WRF-Hydro. Green Sahara (GS) boundary conditions have also been incorporated into the global model so as to capture the remote feedbacks between the Saharan vegetation and the river hydrographs over the TP. Model-data comparisons show that the dynamically downscaled simulations significantly improve the regional climate simulations over the TP in both the modern day and the MH, highlighting the crucial role of downscaling in both presentday and past climates. TP precipitation is also strongly affected by the greening of the Sahara, with a particularly large increase over the southern TP, as well as a delay in the monsoon withdrawal. The simulation results were first validated over the upper basins of the three rivers before the hydrological responses to the MH forcing for the three basins were quantified. Both the upper Yellow and Yangtze rivers exhibit a decline in streamflow during the MH, especially in summer, which is a combined effect of less snowmelt and stronger evapotranspiration. The GS forcing caused a rise in temperature during the MH, as well as larger rainfall but less snowfall and greater evaporative water losses. The Brahmaputra River runoff is simulated to increase in the MH due to greater net precipitation.					; Huo, Yiling/JVO-7401-2024; Peltier, William/A-1102-2008	Huo, Yiling/0000-0002-1888-8015; Chandan, Deepak/0000-0002-0756-754X; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				OCT 25	2022	18	10					2401	2420		10.5194/cp-18-2401-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2401-2022													WOS:000871574800001

Extremophile microorganisms are found in several extreme marine environments, such as hydrothermal vents, hot springs, salty lakes and deep-sea floors. The ability of these microorganisms to support extremes of temperature, salinity and pressure demonstrates their great potential for biotechnological processes. Hydrolases including amylases, cellulases, peptidases and lipases from hyperthermophiles, psychrophiles, halophiles and piezophiles have been investigated for these reasons. Extremozymes are adapted to work in harsh physical-chemical conditions and their use in various industrial applications such as the biofuel, pharmaceutical, fine chemicals and food industries has increased. The understanding of the specific factors that confer the ability to withstand extreme habitats on such enzymes has become a priority for their biotechnological use. The most studied marine extremophiles are prokaryotes and in this review, we present the most studied archaea and bacteria extremophiles and their hydrolases, and discuss their use for industrial applications.

Since the mid-1990s, the species has spread along the entire Estonian Baltic coastline. Growth rate in the brackish water population does not differ much from freshwater populations, but the freshwater populations are gynogenetic (or show high dominance of females) in contrast to the Baltic Sea population, which presents a normal sex ratio. The recent explosion of this species in the Baltic Sea could be explained by unusually warm summers during the 1990s and by the low abundance of predatory fish.																			0175-8659					AUG	2005	21	4					287	291		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2005.00680.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2005.00680.x													WOS:000231508000006

Pop-off data storage tags reveal niche partitioning between native and non-native predators in a novel ecosystem	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Niche partitioning might be predicted to be particularly dynamic in 'novel ecosystems' characterized by human-altered environmental conditions and biological invasions. Restoration efforts for native species in such systems can be informed by detailed characterization of niche partitioning. In Lake Ontario, fishery management agencies have been engaged in a long-term struggle to restore native top predators including lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Meanwhile, management agencies continue to stock non-native species like Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) into the lake to support a recreational fishery and to help control the abundance of a non-native forage fish, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). We used pop-off data storage tags to study fine scale (9.1M lines of data from 22 animals) behaviour and habitat use by lake trout (native) and Chinook salmon (non-native) in Lake Ontario in terms of depth and temperature, recorded at <= 70 s intervals for periods of up to 12 months. Chinook salmon occupied warmer and shallower waters during summer than did lake trout, and their niche breadth was wider. They achieved greater niche breadth in part because they were much more active vertically, cumulatively traveling 103 +/- 1 m/hour during summer (model-estimated median), whereas most lake trout were relatively inactive vertically (7 +/- 1 m/hour). In each of our analyses, there was more inter-individual variation among lake trout than among Chinook salmon, driven by some lake trout that spent considerable time making forays into warmer, shallower waters. Synthesis and applications. Our results illustrate the different foraging tactics used by two species in the Great Lakes and reflect their distinct life histories. Physical niche partitioning between Chinook salmon and lake trout helps to explain how these species can co-exist in a multi-species fishery even while having overlap in diet. The diversity of behaviours exhibited here by native lake trout have likely helped them persist during dramatic changes to the forage base in recent decades; that flexibility could help underlie their long-term prospects for restoration during future changes to the ecosystem.					; Kessel, Steven/HMP-2841-2023	Raby, Graham/0000-0002-0549-4017; Kessel, Steven/0000-0001-7729-7701													0021-8901	1365-2664				JAN	2020	57	1					181	191		10.1111/1365-2664.13522	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13522		OCT 2019											WOS:000493079400001

Are pollen-based climate models improved by combining surface samples from soil and lacustrine substrates?	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Differences between pollen assemblages obtained from lacustrine and terrestrial surface sediments may affect the ability to obtain reliable pollen-based climate reconstructions. We test the effect of combining modern pollen samples from multiple depositional environments on various pollen-based climate reconstruction methods using modern pollen samples from British Columbia, Canada and adjacent Washington, Montana, Idaho and Oregon states. This dataset includes samples from a number of depositional environments including soil and lacustrine sediments. Combining lacustrine and terrestrial (soil) samples increases root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for reconstructions of summer growing degree days when weighted-averaging partial-least-squares (WAPLS), weighted-averaging (WA) and the non-metric-multidimensional-scaling/generalized-additive-models (NMDS/GAM) are used but reduces RMSEP for randomForest, the modern analogue technique (MAT) and the Mixed method, although a slight increase occurs for MAT at the highest sample size. Summer precipitation reconstructions using MAT, randomForest and NMDS/GAM suffer from increased RMSEP when both lacustrine and terrestrial samples are used, but WA, WAPLS and the Mixed method show declines in RMSEP. These results indicate that researchers interested in using pollen databases to reconstruct climate variables need to consider the depositional environments of samples within the analytical dataset since pooled datasets can increase model error for some climate variables. However, since the effects of the pooled datasets will vary between climate variables and between pollen-based climate reconstruction methods we do not reject the use of mixed samples altogether. We finish by proposing steps to test whether significant reductions in model error can be obtained by splitting or combining samples from multiple substrates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Bridging theory and practice towards multiple stressor management in freshwater ecosystems	WATER RESEARCH												Despite advances in conceptual understanding, single-stressor abatement approaches remain common in the management of fresh waters, even though they can produce unexpected ecological responses when multiple stressors interact. Here we identify limitations restricting the development of multiple-stressor management strategies and address these, bridging theory and practice, within a novel empirical framework. Those critical limitations include that (i) monitoring schemes fall short of accounting for theory on relationships between multiple-stressor interactions and ecological responses, (ii) current empirical modelling approaches neglect the prevalence and intensity of multiple-stressor interactions, and (iii) mechanisms of stressor interactions are often poorly understood. We offer practical recommendations for the use of empirical models and experiments to predict the effects of freshwater degradation in response to changes in multiple stressors, demonstrating this approach in a case study. Drawing on our framework, we offer practical recommendations to support the development of effective management strategies in three general multiple-stressor scenarios. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, year-to-year changes of P loading in lakes restored with variable methods (sustainable restoration, P inactivation with iron compounds and magnesium chloride, nitrate treatment and effective microorganisms (EM) application) were expected. To verify these assumptions, we have analysed the process of internal P loading in 40 waterbodies situated in Western Poland, based on the ex situ experiments on intact sediment cores, collected from different water depths in various seasons. Additionally, basic sediment characteristics (TP and its fraction content, organic matter, SRP and TP in pore water and water above sediments) were studied. The most intensive P release from sediments into water column was noted in summer, especially at greater depths and in heavily eutrophicated lakes. Internal P loading in restored lakes usually decreased, apart from lakes in which EM were used.

Only one bird was infected with a Plasmodium sp. Parasite intensity was seven per 10,000 erythrocytes. The low prevalence of Plasmodium sp. and the lack of other blood parasites in resident mallards suggests that hemosporid parasitism at the southern periphery of their breeding range is very different from that at the northern breeding grounds.																			0005-2086	1938-4351				OCT-DEC	1994	38	4					885	886		10.2307/1592129	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1592129								7702525					WOS:A1994PZ31800027

This study investigates the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the structure of microbial communities in lake water and sediments, offering novel insights into the ecosystem's dynamics. In winter, DOM in the lake water is primarily derived from decaying plant and animal matter, while sediment DOM is predominantly associated with microbial activity. Statistical analyses revealed significant correlations between DOM components and key microbial species, including Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria (p < 0.05), highlighting the critical role of microbial communities in DOM transformation. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a latent variable approach integrating multiple regression analysis, demonstrates that DOM composition, along with environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, and nutrient levels, significantly influences microbial diversity and community dynamics in the lake. These findings highlight the importance of seasonally adjusting management strategies - such as controlling nutrient inputs, monitoring water quality, and managing sediments - to protect key microbial communities and sustain ecosystem health.					; Duarte, Isabel/B-1619-2014; Duarte, Isabel Maria/B-1619-2014; Gonçalves, José/F-9522-2010; Goncalves, Jose/F-9522-2010; yu, xuezheng/LZI-4153-2025; Fu, Pingqing/G-4863-2013	Hur, Jin/0000-0001-6735-1946; Duarte, Isabel Maria/0000-0003-1516-9266; Feng, Zhuangzhuang/0009-0007-3624-038X; Goncalves, Jose/0000-0001-8646-7880; yu, xuezheng/0009-0001-7438-7557; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				MAR 1	2025	268								120794	10.1016/j.envres.2025.120794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.120794		JAN 2025						39793877					WOS:001398955400001

Climate change, increasing human development, and resultant permafrost thaw may combine to alter the quality and quantity of fish habitat including reductions in preferred thermal habitat, changes in water quality, and modified drainage patterns. Our study objective was to understand how lake fish communities residing on permafrost landscapes may be responding to climate change and land use disturbance. We investigated the drivers of freshwater fish community health in lakes of the lower Mackenzie River basin, an ice-rich permafrost region that is experiencing substantial warming, permafrost thaw, and new major highway development. We collected lake morphometry, water quality, and fish community data from 50 lakes and derived several indicators of aquatic health including fish species richness, relative abundance, and the occurrence of three culturally important fish species. We found that water quality and lake size were significant co-drivers of fish community health whereas relationships with summer thermal habitat, as represented by July air temperature, were relatively negligible. Dissolved organic carbon (an indicator for lake browning) emerged as a particularly important driver of fish community structure, and fish community health steeply declined when dissolved organic carbon concentrations exceeded 17-18 mg/L. We suggest potential mechanisms for these declines including light inhibition during summer and a reduced capacity for overwintering in smaller and murkier lakes that may experience faster oxygen depletion rates. Using a more expansive regional water quality database of 203 lakes, we observed potential supporting evidence that warming and new road development increased dissolved organic carbon and total phosphorus concentrations, possibly reducing fish habitat quality in this region. Together, these results highlight how fishes relying on the numerous small and shallow lakes that dominate permafrost landscapes may be vulnerable to the combined effects of rapid warming and new infrastructure.

Paleogeographical Reorganization of the Moscow Syneclise during the Severodvinian (Capitanian-Wuchiapingian) Time Based on Isotopic (δ13C and δ18O) and Paleontological Data, Permian Period, East European Platform	PALEONTOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Detailed studies of the isotope composition of carbon and oxygen (delta C-13 and delta O-18) in sedimentary and pedogenic carbonates from the stratotype of the Severodvinian Stage of the Permian System (Sukhona River, Vologda Region) are provided. In these deposits, the value of delta C-13 is the greatest for the Upper Permian and Lower Triassic of European Russia. This level is correlated with the Kamura isotopic geochemical event in the marine sections of Panthalassa and the Tethyan Region, which was connected with a fall in temperature during the Early-Middle Capitanian. Variations of delta O-18 in the Severodvinian Stage also support the concept of general fall in temperature. The lower part of the Severodvinian Stage is characterized by carbonates with a very heavy oxygen isotope composition, about 32-34% SMOW, which accumulated during evaporitization of a large basin. In the upper part of the Severodvinian Stage, the value of delta O-18 rhythmically changes from 22-24% SMOW to 34%, naturally following the cyclicity established based on sedimentological features. The minimal values of delta O-18 are episodes of a significant decrease in salinity as a result of decreased temperature and humidification. The highest values of the isotope content of oxygen correspond to the episodes of short warming and evaporitization of shallow lakes. A general decrease in average annual temperature in the middle of the Severodvinian Age was associated with activation of rivers and intensification of terrigenous sedimentation, which resulted in replacement of the basin facies by alluvial facies and to wide occurrence of aerial and subaerial conditions. Simultaneously, in the latter half of the Severodvinian Age on the East European Platform, there was essential renewal of assemblages of tetrapods, fishes, ostracodes, mollusks, and plants.

Variability of the hemocyte parameters of cultivated mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lmk 1819) in Sabaudia (Latina, Italy) coastal lagoon	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The Sabaudia's lake consists of a protected coastal lagoon, located in the central Italy, historically characterized by recurrent mortality events of marine fauna during warmer months. A field study was monthly conducted on mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis cultivated inside the lagoon, measuring hemocyte parameters as total circulating count (THC), viability (HV), spreading and oxidative response to in vitro phagocytosis stimulation. A depression of the immune response was observed during the spring season, as indicated by higher values of hemocyte circularity and lower luminescence levels related to respiratory burst, also associated to modulation of THC and HV. The water temperature and the oxygen concentration appeared as the major environmental factors having influence on the phagocytosis activity. Therefore, the hemocyte variations have been intended as early danger signal to evaluate the immunodepression induced by the environmental stressors which could reveal in advance the development of critical situations for mussel survival.

These structures occur near the vent of the flow and differ from the upright folds commonly observed near the tops of lava flows. Farther from the vent, the fold patterns indicate lateral radial shortening and shearing as the spread of lava was impeded. Interpretation of the folds leads to a kinematic model of coaxial flow near the vent grading to simple shear and sub-simple shear away from the vent.					; Smith, John/Y-2316-2019	Smith, John/0000-0002-3335-9488; 													0377-0273					OCT	1994	63	1-2					89	94		10.1016/0377-0273(94)90019-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(94)90019-1													WOS:A1994PL71300006

By using the lake as a batch culture, the aim was to estimate, via different methods, the production of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in the lake and to compare these production estimates with the actual increase in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton biomass. The average water temperature was 3.5.degree. C. Of the phytoplankton biomass, > 90% was the diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii var. pusillus, by the peak of the bloom. The 14C and O2 methods of estimating primary production gave equivalent results (r = 0.999) with a photosynthetic quotient of 1.63. The theoretical photosynthetic quotient predicted from the C/NO3 N assimilation ratio was 1.57. The total integrated incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate into particulate material (> 1 .mu.m) was similar to the increase in phytoplankton C determined from cell counts. Bacterioplankton increased from 0.5 .times. 109 to 1.52 .times. 109 cells l-1 (.apprx. 0.5 .mu.g of C l-1 day-1). Estimates of bacterioplankton production from rates of [3H]thymidine incorporation were .apprx. 1.2-1.7 .mu.g of C l-1 day-1. Bacterial respiration, measured by a high-precision Winkler technique, was estimated as 4.8 .mu.g of C l-1 day-1, indicating a bacterial growth yield of 25%. The bulk of the bacterioplankton production was accounted for by algal extracellular products. Gross bacterioplankton production (production plus respiration) was 20% of gross primary production/m3 of surface area. No indication that bacterioplankton production was underestimated by the [3H]thymidine incorporation method was found.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1984	48	6					1221	1230		10.1128/AEM.48.6.1221-1230.1984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.48.6.1221-1230.1984								16346681					WOS:A1984TV50000027

Seasonal patterns of biomass and nutrient concentrations in the above- and belowground plant parts were observed over a period of two years, and nutrients released from the dead plants into the water environment were estimated at the end of the first year of the study. T. angustifolia shoots accumulated 46.7 g/m(2) N and 4.7 g/m(2) P in 2003 and 56.9 g/m(2) N and 5.9 g/m(2) p in 2004 during the growing season from April to December. At the end of the growing season, as nutrient production and accumulation slowed down, translocation of the nutrients and photoassimilate from leaves to rhizomes started. About 45-48% of the nitrogen and 37-45% of the phosphorus that had accumulated in the shoots were translocated to the rhizomes during the winter. After they died, the shoots released about 4.6 g/m(2) of nitrogen and 0.8 g/m(2) of phosphorus into the water.

Improved environmental DNA sampling scheme for Alabama sturgeon provides new insight into a species once presumed extinct	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Detection of rare species can be challenging and time-consuming using conventional methods, but environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming a commonly used tool for detection in conservation and management of species. This study demonstrates the utility of the precipitation method (precipitated and preserved in 3 M sodium acetate and 95% ethanol) for collection of eDNA to detect the seasonal distribution of the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi). Surface and benthic water samples were collected across a wider geographic area than previously published for Alabama sturgeon eDNA. Surface and benthic samples both yielded detections and resulted in a similar proportion of positive detections to previous work. However, by sampling a greater portion of the distribution of the Alabama sturgeon, further insight was provided on potential sturgeon movement. The results of the precipitation method show that Alabama sturgeon detections increase during spawning months, and that the fish may be overwintering in the Tombigbee River. High detections from winter benthic samples suggest that habitat choice may play a role in detectability and highlight the need to consider natural history when designing environmental DNA studies. When designing environmental DNA collection for rare species, sampling design should factor in species ecology, habitat use, site characteristics, and specific questions driving the research.					; Whitaker, Justine/NVM-1180-2025	Janosik, Alexis/0000-0002-4331-9703; VanTassel, Nichelle/0000-0001-9313-6000; 													0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2021	37	2					178	185		10.1111/jai.14183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.14183		FEB 2021											WOS:000617008300001

We investigated the macrobenthic faunal change after dike construction in Saemangeum Lake, South Korea, in the summer season. From July 2008 to August 2012, many individuals of bivalve species, such as Arcuatula senhousia, Potamocorbula sp., and Ruditapes philippinarum, were collected from the subtidal zone inside the dike, although the dissolved oxygen content in the bottom water was less than 1 mg/L at many stations, where the water depth was more than 2.7 m. In August 2016 and August 2018, however, most macrobenthic animals disappeared from Saemangeum Lake, because the water became more hypoxic than it was in August 2012. These facts suggest that the Saemangeum Dike negatively affects the water quality and macrobenthic animals inside the dike because of the long closure of sluices.																			1880-8247	1882-627X				NOV	2019	14	4					251	260		10.3800/pbr.14.251	http://dx.doi.org/10.3800/pbr.14.251													WOS:000501941000003

Demographic and Life History Characteristics of Black Bullheads Ameiurus melas in a North Temperate USA Lake	FISHES												Black bullheads Ameiurus melas are an environmentally tolerant omnivorous fish species that are found throughout much of North America and parts of Europe. Despite their prevalence, black bullheads are an infrequently studied species making their biology, ecology, and life history poorly understood. Although limited information has been published on black bullheads, evidence suggests that bullheads can dominate the fish biomass and have profound influences on the fish community in some north temperate USA lakes. The goal of our study was to provide additional information on black bullhead population demographics, growth rates, life history characteristics, and seasonal diet preferences in a northern Wisconsin lake. Using common fish collection gears (fyke netting, electrofishing), fish aging protocols, fecundity assessments, and diet indices, our results suggested that black bullheads exhibited relatively fast growth rates, early ages at maturity, moderate fecundity, and a diverse omnivorous diet. Due to these demographic and life history characteristics, black bullheads have the potential to dominate fish community biomass in their native and introduced range. Results from our study may inform the management of black bullhead as native and invasive species.

This study compares seasonal glacier dynamics ("cold" and "warm" seasons) in the ablation zone of Parlung No. 4 Glacier, a temperate glacier in the monsoon-influenced southeastern Tibetan Plateau, by using repeat unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys combined with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry and ground stake measurements. Our results showed that the surveyed ablation zone had a mean change of -2.7 m of ice surface elevation during the period of September 2018 to October 2019 but is characterized by significant seasonal cyclic variations with ice surface elevation lifting (+2.0 m) in the cold season (September 2018 to June 2019) but lowering (-4.7 m) in the warm season (June 2019 to October 2019). Over an annual timescale, surface lowering was greatly suppressed by the resupply of ice from the glacier's accumulation area-the annual emergence velocity compensates for about 55% of surface ablation in our study area. Cold season emergence velocities (3.0 +/- 1.2 m) were similar to 5-times larger than those observed in the warm season (0.6 +/- 1.0 m). Distinct spring precipitation patterns may contribute to these distinct seasonal signals. Such seasonal dynamic conditions are possibly critical for different glacier responses to climate change in this region of the Tibetan Plateau, and perhaps further afield.

Depth profiles of pressure, temperature, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured with a YSI 6600 profiler. Water samples were taken with a Niskin bottle and analyzed for dissolved oxygen and nutrients by standard photometric methods. Major anions and cations were analyzed by ion chromatography and ICP-OES, respectively. Benthic flux experiments were carried out with sediment cores in a batch mode assay on-site. In the Small Aral, the changes in the hydrochemical properties are not as dramatic as in the Large Aral. The Small Aral represents a brackish inland water body with salinities of 17-18 g kg(-1). The wind-mixed layer reached 8 m during the survey. The salinity is vertically and horizontally almost uniform. Below 8 m, a temporally hypoxic layer forms during summer. Salt redissolution was found to be an important source of salt in the water. About 33.5 g SO32- m(-2) day(-1) and about 30.7 g Cl- m(-2) day(-1) are released from the sediment in summer. In the Large Aral, the salinity distribution is uniform in shallow waters (less than 5 m) but varies strongly in deeper water. Tschebas Bay at the northern tip of the large Aral represents a shallow lagoon with a maximum depth of about 6 m. The water column was well mixed down to the bottom (similar to 6 m) having salt concentrations of 82 g kg(-1) on average. Almost no gradients in dissolved substances were observed. It is suspected that salinity is balanced by fresher water inflow originating from the Syr Darya flowing south and by groundwater exfiltration. Chemishov Bay in the north of the western basin is meromictic. Below a wind-mixed layer, a very strong pycnocline of 20 g kg(-1) per m at 5 m depth isolates the water below from exchanges with the water above and led to the formation of huge anoxic water body down to the bottom at about 25 m depth. Below 10 m, the water contains hydrogen sulphide. The salt concentration increases from 82 g kg(-1) in the surface water to 110 g kg(-1) at depth. The salt release from the sediment is as high as 1143 g SO42- m(-2) day(-1) and 1626 g Cl- m(-2) day(-1). Benthic release of salt is considered as an important source for salt in the bottom water of the western basin and in sustaining the stable density stratification. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Legovic, T; Justic, D				Legovic, T; Justic, D			When do phytoplankton blooms cause the most intense hypoxia in the northern Adriatic Sea?	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA					International Colloquium on Long-Term Changes in Marine Ecosystems	FEB 01-03, 1995	ARCACHON, FRANCE	Inst Francais Rech Exploitat Mer, CNRS, Inst Natl Sci Univers				Eutrophication of the northern Adriatic Sea was investigated using data on dissolved oxygen (DO) from 1911 to 1982. Beginning in the period 1955-1965, DO concentrations increased in the surface layer and decreased close to the bottom in all seasons except winter. These changes are attributed to an increase of the anthropogenic nutrient inflow. The occurrence of hypoxia near the bottom and its disappearance were investigated using the vertical distribution of DO on the transect from the Po delta to Rovinj during 1973. Horizontal distributions of DO close to the surface and near the bottom show prominent gradients from the Po delta towards the middle of the northern Adriatic Sea. Application of a simple box model indicates that phytoplankton blooms which occur in July cause the lowest DO concentrations near the bottom. For DO concentrations near the bottom to increase, anthropogenic nutrient inflow into the northern Adriatic Sea must be significantly reduced.

Volcanic signature of Basin and Range extension on the shrinking Cascade arc, Klamath Falls-Keno area, Oregon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Detailed geologic mapping of the Klamath Falls-Keno area revealed the complex relationship between subduction, crustal extension, and magmatic composition of the southern Oregon Cascade volcanic arc. Volcanism in the study area at similar to 7-4Ma consisted of calc-alkaline basaltic andesite and andesite lava flowing over a relatively flat landscape. Local angular unconformities are evidence that Basin and Range extension began at by at least similar to 4Ma and continues today with fault blocks tilting at a long-term rate of similar to 2 degrees/Ma to 3 degrees/Ma. Minimum NW-SE extension is similar to 1.5km over similar to 28km (similar to 5%). High-alumina olivine tholeiite (HAOT) or low-K, low-Ti transitional high-alumina olivine tholeiite (LKLT) erupted within and adjacent to the back edge of the calc-alkaline arc as the edge receded westward at a rate of similar to 10km/Ma at 2.7-0.45Ma. The volcanic front migrated east much slower than the back arc migrated west: similar to 0km/Ma for 6-0.4Ma calc-alkaline rocks; similar to 0.7km/Ma, if similar to 6Ma HAOT-LKLT is included; and similar to 1km/Ma, if highly differentiated 17-30Ma volcanic rocks of the early Western Cascades are included. Declining convergence probably decreased asthenospheric corner flow, decreasing width of calc-alkaline and HAOT-LKLT volcanism and the associated heat flow anomaly, the margins of which focused on Basin and Range extension and leakage of HAOT-LKLT magma to the surface. This declining corner flow combined with steepening slab dip shifted the back arc west. Compensation of extension by volcanic intrusion and extrusion allowed growth of imposing range-front fault scarps only behind the trailing edge of the shrinking arc.

However, the recent status of these life-preserving habitats remains poorly known. We performed field geomorphological mapping and limnological characterization of lakes distributed across Devil's Bay in the northern area of Vega Island, James Ross Archipelago, and described some significant changes in their physical and chemical properties during the 2013 summer season. Fifty lakes were described in the area, even though the area is relatively small (similar to 12 km(2)). Six major lake types were distinguished based on their geomorphological settings and their origins, and their hydrochemical properties were compared with the neighbouring lake districts. The geomorphic characteristics of the lakes range from stable lakes on till plains (21 out of 50 lakes), to kettle lakes on fresh moraines with an unstable shoreline, to very dynamic ice-contact lakes with fluctuating water levels and inundated areas. The ice-contact lake dynamics were observed using 'Lake Payer' as an example. At the interface between hydrology and geosciences, this study provides new and original data from a yet largely unexplored region and emphasizes the importance of cross-disciplinary research in polar sciences.

Does salinity change determine zooplankton variability in the saline Qarun Lake (Egypt)?	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Zooplankton and 14 abiotic variables were studied during August 2011 at 10 stations in Lake Qarun, Egypt. Stations with the lowest salinity and highest nutrient concentrations and turbidity were close to the discharge of waters from the El-Bats and El-Wadi drainage systems. A total of 15 holozooplankton species were identified. The salinity in Lake Qarun increased and fluctuated since 1901: 12 g/L in 1901; 8.5 g/L in 1905; 12.0 g/L in 1922; 30.0 g/L in 1985; 38.7 g/L in 1994; 35.3 g/L in 2006, and 33.4 g/L in 2011. The mean concentration of nutrients (nitrate, nitrite and orthophosphate) gradually increased from 35, 0.16 and 0.38 A mu g/L, respectively, in 1953-1955 to 113, 16.4, and 30.26 A mu g/L in 2011. From 1999-2003 some decrease of species diversity occurred. Average total zooplankton density was 30 000 ind./m(3) in 1974-1977; 356 125 ind./m(3) in 1989; 534 000 ind./m(3) in 1994-1995; from 965 000 to 1 452 000 ind./m(3) in 2006, and 595 000 ind./m(3) in 2011. A range of long-term summer salinity variability during the last decades was very similar to a range of salinity spatial variability in summer 2011. There is no significant correlation between zooplankton abundance and salinity in spatial and long-term changes. We conclude that salinity fluctuations since at least 1955 did not directly drive the changes of composition and abundance of zooplankton in the lake. A marine community had formed in the lake, and it continues to change. One of the main drivers of this change is a regular introduction and a pressure of alien species on the existent community. Eutrophication also plays an important role. The introduction of Mnemiopsis leidyi, first reported in 2014, may lead to a start of a new stage of the biotic changes in Lake Qarun, when eutrophication and the population dynamics of this ctenophore will be main drivers of the ecosystem change.

We conducted an experimental transmission regimen to determine if WDSV is capable of inducing dermal sarcoma in the closely related sauger S. canadense. Nearly all of young-of-the-year saugers (96%) inoculated with filtrates of spring-collected tumors developed dermal sarcomas, while all of the inoculated walleyes developed tumors. Most of the sauger tumors were limited to the skin, but invasive tumors, similar to those previously observed in experimental walleyes, were observed in some fish.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				FEB 26	1998	32	1					9	14		10.3354/dao032009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao032009								9676258					WOS:000073170900002
J	Heggie, TW				Heggie, Travis W.			Swimming with death: Naegleria fowleri infections in recreational waters	TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE												Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba commonly found in warm freshwater environments such as hot springs, lakes, natural mineral water, and resort spas frequented by tourists. N. fowleri is the etiologic agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), an acute fatal disease of the central nervous system that results in death in approximately seven days. Previously thought to be a rare condition, the number of reported PAM cases is increasing each year. PAM is difficult to diagnose because the clinical signs of the disease are similar to bacterial meningitis. Thus, the key to diagnosis is physician awareness and clinical suspicion. With the intent of creating awareness among travel medicine practitioners and the tourism industry, this review focuses on the presenting features of N. fowleri and PAM and offers insight into the prevention and treatment of the disease.

Todd			Drought and post-drought rain effect on stream phosphorus and other nutrient losses in the Northeastern USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Our study was conducted in the Owasco Lake watershed, which is part of the Finger Lakes, located in Central NY. Study focus: In the Northeastern United States (NE US), nutrient pollution is receiving increasing attention, and particularly phosphorus (P), in response to the recent increasing frequency of toxic blue-green algal blooms. This study assesses how land use, seasonal weather patterns, and climate extremes interact to control runoff and nutrient loading from tributaries into Owasco Lake. In 2016, NE US experienced a prolonged drought, which resulted in unusual and extreme low flows between August and October. The drought was ended by an intense rain event at the end of October. New hydrological insights for the region: The results show that during the drought period the expected influence of agricultural and mixed land use on P loads was masked. However, high P loads were observed during the first rain event after the drought, exacerbating the agricultural impact on water quality. This study aids in understanding how climate extremes might affect nutrient runoff dynamics in the NE US. These findings are an important contribution from a management perspective, as projections for the NE US suggest that total precipitation will slightly increase, but large changes are expected in the extremes, with summer rains becoming concentrated in fewer events of higher intensities, interspaced with prolonged dry periods.

The pollen sequence CON01-603-2 (53 degrees 57'N, 108 degrees 54'E) was recovered from a 386 m water depth in the Continent Ridge and dated to ca. 130 - 114.8 ky BP. This time interval covers the complete last interglacial (LI), corresponding to MIS 5e. Results of pollen analysis and pollen-based quantitative biome reconstruction show pronounced changes in the regional vegetation throughout the record. Shrubby tundra covered the area at the beginning of MIS 5e ( ca. 130 - 128 ky), consistent with the end of the Middle Pleistocene glaciation. The late glacial climate was characterised by low winter and summer temperatures (T-c similar to - 38 to -35 degrees C and T-w similar to 11-13 degrees C) and low annual precipitation (P-ann similar to 300 mm). However, the wide spread of tundra vegetation suggests rather moist environments associated with low temperatures and evaporation ( reconstructed alpha similar to 1). Tundra was replaced by boreal conifer forest (taiga) by ca. 128 ky BP, suggesting a transition to the interglacial. Taiga-dominant phase lasted until ca. 117.4 ky BP, e. g. about 10 ky. The most favourable climate conditions occurred during the first half of the LI. P-ann reached 500 mm soon after 128 ky BP. However, temperature changed more gradually. Maximum values of T-c similar to - 20 degrees C and T-w similar to 16 - 17 degrees C are reconstructed from about 126 ky BP. Conditions became gradually colder after ca. 121 ky BP. T-c dropped to similar to - 27 degrees C and T-w to similar to 15 degrees C by 119.5 ky BP. The reconstructed increase in continentality was accompanied by a decrease in P-ann to similar to 400 - 420 mm. However, the climate was still humid enough (alpha similar to 0.9) to support growth of boreal evergreen conifers. A sharp turn towards a dry climate is reconstructed after ca. 118 ky BP, causing retreat of forest and spread of cool grass-shrub communities. Cool steppe dominated the vegetation in the area between ca. 117.5 ky and 114.8 ky BP, suggesting the end of the interglacial and transition to the last glacial (MIS 5d). Shift to the new glaciation was characterised by cool and very dry conditions with T-c similar to - 28 to - 30 degrees C, T-w similar to 14-15 degrees C, P-ann similar to 250 mm and alpha similar to 0.5.					; Bezrukova, Elena/O-9114-2015; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020	Nita, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1843-0071; Granoszewski, Wojciech/0000-0002-1615-6777; Brewer, Simon/0000-0002-6810-1911; /0000-0002-7219-5009													0930-7575	1432-0894				OCT	2005	25	6					625	637		10.1007/s00382-005-0045-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-005-0045-0													WOS:000233042200004

The model succeeded in representing the hydrodynamic processes occurring in the lake such as thermal stratification during summer 2005 followed by the complete mixing of the water column in February 2006. The results of the PCB fate model highlighted that these processes play a key role for the settling of particles and consequently for the distribution of PCBs in the water column as well as for the contaminant flux at the sediment-water interface. On the air-water front, the simulations emphasised that the net atmospheric PCB input fluxes are generally more important during the cold season and show peaks during periods of high wet deposition. Finally, the seasonal variability of the distribution of PCB in the water column was assessed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability of R. raciborskii to produce cyanotoxins - in particular the alkaloid cylindrospermopsin (CYN), which is toxic to humans and animals - is of serious concern. The first appearance of R. raciborskii in Russia was noted in Lake Nero in the summer of 2010. This is the northernmost (57 degrees N) recorded case of the simultaneous presence of R. raciborskii and detection of CYN. In this study, the data from long-term monitoring of the R. raciborskii population, temperature and light conditions in Lake Nero were explored. CYN and cyr/aoa genes present in environmental samples were examined using HPLC/MS-MS and PCR analysis. A R. raciborskii strain (R104) was isolated and its morphology, toxigenicity and phylogeography were studied. It is supposed that the trigger factor for the strong development of R. raciborskii in Lake Nero in summer 2010 may have been the relatively high water temperature, reaching 29-30 degrees C. Strain R. raciborskii R104 has straight trichomes and can produce akinetes, making it morphologically similar to European strains. Phylogeographic analysis based on nifH gene and 16S-23S rRNA ITS1 sequences showed that the Russian strain R104 grouped together with R. raciborskii strains isolated from Portugal, France, Germany and Hungary. The Russian strain R104 does not contain cyrA and cyrB genes, meaning that it - like all European strains - cannot produce CYN. Thus, while recent invasion of R. raciborskii into Lake Nero has occurred, morphological, genetic, and toxicological data supported the spreading of this cyanobacterium from other European lakes. Detection of CYN and cyr/aoa genes in environmental samples indicated the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon gracile as a likely producer of CYN in Lake Nero. The article also discusses data on the global biogeography of R. raciborskii. Genetic similarity between R. raciborskii strains isolated from very remote continents might be related to the ancient origin of the cyanobacterium inhabiting the united continents of Laurasia and Gondwana, rather than comparably recent transoceanic exchange between R. raciborskii populations.

To determine if the environmental levels of this compound were changing significantly, we measured the long-term temporal trends of its concentrations near the Great Lakes between 2005 and 2015 using air (vapor particle phase) samples (N = 1047) and precipitation samples (N = 449). We used a multiple linear regression model of DP concentrations to isolate the variabilities due to sampling date and population near the sampling site. The results show that the total DP concentrations in precipitation varied seasonally, maximizing on January 18, but the concentrations in the vapor particle phase did not show seasonal variations. Vapor + particle phase DP levels were relatively high in Cleveland, and precipitation DP levels were relatively high at Point Petre. DP's concentrations in neither phase were changing as a function of sampling date, indicating that the input of this compound into the environment is continuing, presumably because its use and production are not regulated. Based on the ratio of the anti conformer relative to the total of the two conformer concentrations, we suggest that the syn conformer is somewhat more environmentally stable than the anti conformer.

Their average paleomagnetic pole is 45-degrees-N, 189-degrees-E (dp=6-degrees, dm=8-degrees), falling on the Keweenawan track of the North American apparent polar wander path (APWP) between 1098-1107 Ma reverse-polarity (R) and 1087-1098 Ma normal-polarity (N) poles of Lake Superior lavas and dikes. Unlike the Keweenawan paleopoles, which have a reversal asymmetry of almost-equal-to 30-degrees, the Shenango and Nemegosenda R and N poles are almost 180-degrees reversed, which was found also by Lewchuk and Symons (1990b). This symmetry of R and N poles casts doubt on the previously accepted predominance of asymmetric reversals of the Earth's field in Keweenawan time. The Archean Shawmere anorthosite is overprinted by a B magnetization with mean direction D=97-degrees, I=-68-degrees (k=12, alpha95=10-degrees, N=18 sites). The Shawmere B paleopole at 38-degrees-N, 226-degrees-E (dp=13-degrees, dm=16-degrees) falls between the carbonatite poles and almost-equal-to 1850 Ma cratonic poles, and the B magnetization seems to be a composite of middle and late Proterozoic overprints. Sites in the western part of the Shawmere body close to the ''carbonatite line'' of faults linking the various alkaline complexes are severely altered, with an abundance of secondary magnetite and hematite. Virtual geomagnetic poles for these sites fall close to the Keweenawan track and have an average pole of 189-degrees-E, 53-degrees-N (dp=15-degrees, dm=20-degrees), suggesting that the B NRM at these sites is an almost-equal-to 1100 Ma thermochemical overprint caused by hydrothermal fluids at the time of carbonatite intrusion. More easterly sites are less altered. Their VGPs resemble almost-equal-to 1850 Macratonic poles and average to 235-degrees-E, 30-degrees-N(dp=15-degrees, dm=17-degrees). These B natural remanent magnetizations are probably thermochemical remanent magnetizations impressed by middle Proterozoic hydrothermal activity associated with intrusion of early alkaline bodies, fault movement on the Ivanhoe Lake fault zone, or late-stage uplift of the KSZ.

Meromixis and Seasonal Dynamics of Vertical Structure of Lake Uchum (South Siberia)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The seasonal dynamics of the vertical structure of small saline Lake Uchum, located in the steppe arid zone of the south of Siberia (Krasnoyarsk krai), has been studied in detail for the first time. This lake is a meromictic water body. We have revealed a heterogeneous vertical distribution of plankton organisms and a dense population of purple sulfuric bacteria in the redox zone. The taxonomic composition and seasonal dynamics of phyto- and zooplankton are described. Presumably, the meromixis of Lake Uchum is due to the inflow of fresh water to the surface of the saline water body during the rise of its level in the early 20th century, similarly to lakes Shira and Shunet located nearby. The processes of salt displacement into the solution during the formation of ice, as well as the precipitation of salts in the winter, also contribute to the maintenance of permanent stratification. The information on the current state of the lake can be useful for reconstructing the climate by bottom sediments, as well as for creating a model of water quality and investigating the therapeutic properties of lake mud.					; Anufrieva, Tatiana/HKV-5761-2023; Barkhatov, Yuri/T-6681-2017; Botvich, Irina/HKT-6131-2023; Rogozin, Denis/AAE-8113-2019	Ivanova, Elena/0000-0002-3220-103X; Barkhatov, Yuri/0000-0003-4547-0439; Tatiana, Anufrieva/0000-0001-7637-295X; 													1995-4255	1995-4263				MAR	2018	11	2					195	206		10.1134/S1995425518020117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425518020117													WOS:000430316400007
J	Frederick, CD				Frederick, CD			Late quaternary clay dune sedimentation on the Llano Estacado, Texas	PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST												The geologic history of clay dunes of the Llano Estacado, also known as lunettes or lee-side dunes, is closely tied to the hydraulic history of the lakes and playas with which they are intimately associated. These dunes grow rapidly during periods of low lake stage and mudflat exposure, and more slowly during periods of high stage, when the sediment source, namely the lake bed and shore deposits, are greatly reduced in size. Dunes of this type are omnipresent but rarely studied features of the Llano Estacado. This paper briefly examines the morphology and age of these features and presents lithologic and geochronologic data from one such dune in Martin County, Texas. Variations in lithology associated with episodic sedimentation of the Sulphur Springs Draw lunette point to a period of low water tables during the last millennium and support a hypothesis of regional aridification at that time. Eolian sedimentation after 970 yrs BP accompanied pronounced deviations in lithology, indicating a change in conditions at the sediment source, a small salt lake on the floor of Sulphur Springs Draw. Increased amounts of clay, gypsum, and calcium carbonate in clay dune sediment suggest a drop in the local water table, exposure of the adjacent lake bed, and therefore a probable change to a more arid regional climate. The increased eolian activity, channel entrenchment, and fluctuating lacustrine and ground water conditions recorded at a number of widely scattered localities across the Great Plains around 1000 yrs BP may be the physical manifestations of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly.																			0032-0447					MAY	1998	43	164					137	155		10.1080/2052546.1998.11931896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2052546.1998.11931896													WOS:000074618400004

Floods in the Southern Alps of New Zealand: the importance of atmospheric rivers	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Extremely high precipitation occurs in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, associated with both orographic enhancement and synoptic-scale weather processes. In this study, we test the hypothesis that atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a key driver of floods in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Vertically integrated water vapour and horizontal water vapour transport, and atmospheric circulation, are investigated concurrently with major floods on the Waitaki River (a major South Island river). Analysis of the largest eight winter maximum floods between 1979 and 2012 indicates that all are associated with ARs. Geopotential height fields reveal that these ARs are located in slow eastward moving extratropical cyclones, with high pressure to the northeast of New Zealand. The confirmation of ARs as a contributor to Waitaki flooding indicates the need for their further exploration to better understand South Island hydrometeorological extremes.

The seasonal dynamics of adult C. cooperi is characterized by their disappearance from centrarchid definitive hosts during the fall months. More than 99% of the metacercariae in subimagoes of H. limbata occur in the abdomen and > 70% in IV, V and VI abdominal segments; the distribution of metacercariae among the abdominal segments is identical in the 2 sexes. During April and May and among the smallest nymphs during periods of recruitment, metacercariae distributions were best fit by the Poisson. With 1 exception, following the initiation of recruitment and continuing throughout each sampling period, the negative binomial model provided the best fit to observed frequency distributions of metacercariae in larger nymphs and subimagoes. Based on these observations, the frequency distributions seem to be generated by the compounding of Poisson variates which arise as a consequence of random waves of invasion by cercariae.

J	Unrein, F; Vinocur, A				Unrein, F; Vinocur, A			Phytoplankton structure and dynamics in a turbid Antarctic Lake (Potter Peninsula, King George Island)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Qualitative and quantitative changes in the freshwater phytoplankton from one of the largest lakes in Potter Peninsula were studied during the summer period of 1995/1996. The main limnological features were analysed. This research constitutes the first study dealing with the phytoplankton structure and dynamics from lakes in Potter Peninsula. Due to the mixing of the water column by the constant wind action during the ice-free period, neither physical, chemical nor biological parameters showed differences between depths. Soluble reactive phosphorus remained low (26 mu g l(-1)) while total phosphorus concentrations were up to 232 mu g l(-1). Suspended solids and total phosphorus differed significantly between the two basins in which the lake is divided. Sixty-five taxa were identified. The Bacillariophyceae was the dominant class followed by Chrysophyceae. Achnanthes lanceolata var. haynaldii and Hydrurus foetidus (cysts) were the dominant species. Tychoplanktonic species were the best represented in terms of abundance and species richness. The principal component analysis carried out with abiotic variables showed a temporal gradient characterised by the augmentation of suspended solids, total phosphorus, conductivity, pH and NH4-N to the end of the summer period. The Principal Component Analysis performed with biotic variables also showed a temporal trend related to a decline in phytoplankton density and an enhancement of chlorophyll-a despite a slight increase of light limitation during the study period. This inverse relation may be due to the presence of picoplankton in chlorophyll-a samples. The potential effect of grazing on the phytoplankton structure is a subject to be tested in future studies.

Data on the under-ice layer mineralization variations derived from water conductivity measurements using the SBE-25 high-precision CTD sonde are compared with the results of calculation of salt separation during the formation and growth of the ice cover. The studies demonstrated that the mineralization increase is affected not only by salinization during ice crystallization but also by the water inflow from the central basin of the lake and from the Selenga River (more than a half of its runoff propagates to Southern Baikal in winter).

Evaluation of oxythermal metrics and benchmarks for the protection of cisco (Coregonus artedi) habitat quality and quantity in Wisconsin lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The cisco (Coregonus artedi) requires cold, well-oxygenated water and is threatened by climate warming and lake eutrophication, especially at the southern edge of its range in the Laurentian Great Lakes region. In this paper, a method is described to assess the quality, quantity, and variability of suitable cisco habitat. Two metrics are proposed to characterize existing cisco oxythermal habitat in this region: water temperature in the water column at a dissolved oxygen of 6 mg/L (TDO6) and "cisco layer thickness" (CLT), the vertical extent of the water column within which water temperature is <= 22.8 degrees C and dissolved oxygen is >= 6 mg/L. It is proposed that values of TDO6 = 22.8 degrees C and CLT = 1 m be used as benchmarks to identify cisco lakes with potentially stressful oxythermal habitat. Long-term summer data from 14 Wisconsin cisco lakes with a wide range of limnological characteristics indicated that TDO6 varied from 4.2 to 27.5 degrees C and CLT from -6.2 to 66.7 m. Cisco abundance across lakes was greater at lower values of TDO6 and higher values of CLT, and non-attainments of the proposed benchmarks were most likely in lakes with remnant or extirpated cisco populations. Non-attainment of benchmarks could occur from late June through September, and three or more samples across the entire summer would be required to have a reasonable probability of detecting a non-attainment in TDO6 or CLT within any given year. Across years, to detect a single year of non-attainment with an 80% level of confidence, two years of sampling would be sufficient for CLT and three years for TD06; to detect more than one non-attaining year, three years of sampling for CLT and six years of sampling for TD06 would be required. Despite relatively high temporal variation in some lakes, the proposed metrics and benchmarks appear to have value for assessing cisco oxythermal habitat in the Great Lakes region.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	2018	75	4					600	608		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0043													WOS:000428383300011

However, the environmental controls on the biological productivity of lakes - including surface temperature, ice phenology, nutrient loads, and mixing regime - are increasingly altered by climate warming and land-use changes. To better characterize global trends in lake productivity, we assembled a dataset on chlorophyll-a concentrations as well as associated water quality parameters and surface solar radiation for temperate and cold-temperate lakes experiencing seasonal ice cover. We developed a method to identify periods of rapid net increase of in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations from time series data and applied it to data collected between 1964 and 2019 across 343 lakes located north of 40?. The data show that the spring chlorophyll-a increase periods have been occurring earlier in the year, potentially extending the growing season and increasing the annual productivity of northern lakes. The dataset on chlorophyll-a increase rates and timing can be used to analyze trends and patterns in lake productivity across the northern hemisphere or at smaller, regional scales. We illustrate some trends extracted from the dataset and encourage other researchers to use the open dataset for their own research questions.

However, when and how the desert landscape persisted during both gla-cial and interglacial periods, defined as "permanent" desert here, remain elusive. Here, we present carbonate carbon isotope and grain-size records from the Tarim Basin, western China, revealing a detailed desertification history for the Taklimakan Desert. Our records demonstrate that after desiccation of episodic lakes at ca. 4.9 Ma, alternations of eolian sand dunes and fluvial and playa-like conditions persisted for a long period until 0.7 Ma in the Tarim Basin. The onset of permanent desert landscape around 0.7-0.5 Ma occurred concur-rently with the climatic reorganization across the mid-Pleistocene transition. The occurrence of mountain glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and atmospheric circulation changes may have controlled the formation and extreme aridification of the permanent desert in inland Asia since the mid-Pleistocene transition.

Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the health status of wetland ecosystems such as lakes, identify the variables causing the wetland degradation and work to protect the wetlands from the identified variables in the future. Based on fourteen high-resolution autumn remote sensing images from 1989-2013, the classification characteristics and spatial distribution patterns of wetland landscapes in Poyang Lake were studied through quantitative interpretation technology. An established health assessment index system named the EHCI (Ecological Health Comprehensive Index) was used to assess the health status of Poyang Lake. Additionally, the relationship between water regime and health status of wetland landscape distribution of Poyang Lake were investigated by multivariate statistical analysis. The results demonstrated: (1) The total area of three first level (or six second level) types of wetland landscapes showed a stable status, which was long-term maintaining at about 3026 km(2) from 1989-2013. (2) The water area shows a downward trend, while the areas of vegetation and land-water transition zone show upward trends. (3) The proposed EHCI of the Poyang Lake wetland presented a downward trend. According to the EHCI results from 1989-2013, the health status of Poyang Lake wetland was healthy for two years, unhealthy for four years and sub-healthy for eight years. (4) The water level fluctuation greatly affected the EHCI, and the effect became greater as the water level increased. These results contribute to the understanding of specific effects of hydrological process on the health status of the Poyang Lake wetland. In addition they provide a scientific reference for the maintenance of stable ecosystem functions of the seasonal freshwater lake.

Formation, mechanism and significance of alluvial-dammed lakes in Golmud River catchment, north-eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												This study investigated a series of dammed lakes and downstream-adjacent alluvial fans in the upstream to middle reaches of the Golmud River in the eastern Kunlun Mountain, on the north-eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). An optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology shows the sediments of five dammed lakes developed from c. 45-40, 30-25, 18-14, and 12-8 ka, corresponding to MIS 3b, late MIS 3a, Last Deglaciation, and early Holocene, respectively. The remote sensing data show these dammed lakes have a total area of 109.4 km(2), with the lake volume of more than 4.0 km(3). Symmetric alluvial fans from north-south tributary valleys produced OSL ages of c. 61-52, 42-31, 26-20, and 16-10 ka, corresponding to glaciation periods: the MIS 3c and MIS 3a, MIS 2, and the Last Deglaciation. This suggests that glacial activity is responsible for the alluvial fan development, where dammed rivers occurred first, but lake formation did not take place synchronously until later periods of strong hydrologic activity, resulting from northward intrusions of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) or glacier melt. Thus, the blocking pattern is that river valleys were dammed during periods of glacial activity and lakes formed during wet periods. The lake formation and subsequent drainage may have resulted in: (i) impeded headwater incision and strengthening of downstream dissection; (ii) enriched the halite and potash in the distal Qarhan Salt Lake through hydrologic and hydrochemical processes of abundant water input, the salt lake expansion, salt redissolution from playa and final resedimentation during later dry periods. The alluvial-dammed lake pattern in the mountain-basin systems of eastern Kunlun Mountain offers a model for assessing the linkages between monsoon dynamics, geomorphic processes and distal salt lake evolutions in other arid regions.

J	ROULET, NT; WOO, MK				ROULET, NT; WOO, MK			WETLAND AND LAKE EVAPORATION IN THE LOW ARCTIC	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Evaporation from wetland and lake surfaces in the continuous permafrost region of the Low Arctic was studied using an energy balance Bowen ratio approach and lysimeter measurements respectively. Daily evaporation was also estimated using the Priestley-Taylor model. Over the summer, mean evaporation from the wetland and lake were similar, but day-to-day variation was large at times. Differences of available energy and surface roughness between the lake and wetland surface produce a larger Priestly-Taylor .alpha. value for wetland evaporation. The approach presented in this paper can be used to estimate evaporation for wetland and lake surfaces in the low arctic region.					; Roulet, Nigel/W-3402-2019	Roulet, Nigel/0000-0001-9571-1929; 													0004-0851					MAY	1986	18	2					195	200		10.2307/1551129	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551129													WOS:A1986C735900007

The sediments deposited during this period are annually laminated. A varve chronology was established and supported by Cs-137 measurements. Micro-facies and diatom assemblage composition analyses were confirmed in thin sections and compared statistically with limnological and meteorological data. Comparison of phytoplankton data with diatom assemblage data from the sediment for the time interval from 1988 to 1999 proved that the sediments reflect limnological processes in the lake and record seasonal changes in the primary producer communities. Among the climatological data, the number of contiguous ice days (days with maximal temperatures a parts per thousand currency sign0 A degrees C) and the state of the winter NAO are strong predictors for micro-facies development and diatom assemblage composition. Furthermore, solar and local (nutrient input) influences are visible in the diatom assemblage compositions. Our study illustrates the high potential for using analyses of micro-facies and diatom assemblages to reconstruct past weather conditions in varved sediments of Lake Belau.

This study aims at investigating microbial community and its shifts corresponding to different water quality during the test running period of Qingcaosha Reservoir. The results showed lower concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the reservoir than that in Yangtze Estuary. The number of total cultivable bacteria was significantly lower in the reservoir than that of Yangtze Estuary. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed that the dominant microbes were alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, Flavobacterium, Rheinheimera, Prochlorococcus, and Synechococcus. The quantitative PCR (q-PCR) results revealed significantly higher number of cyanobacteria and Microcystis in the reservoir during summer season. In addition, bacterial abundance positively correlated with TP concentration inside the reservoir. These results indicated that Qingcaosha Reservoir had ability to reduce the TN and TP in influent and improve the water quality overall. However, it also faced the risk of potential cyanobacteria bloom and eutrophication in Qingcaosha Reservoir where phosphorus will be the nutrient limiting factor.					; Lu, Jun/H-5019-2019	Lu, Jun/0000-0003-0225-6643; Xie, Bing/0000-0003-2335-5966													0175-7598	1432-0614				DEC	2014	98	23					9849	9858		10.1007/s00253-014-5928-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-5928-8								25042596					WOS:000345140200027

In this paper, we combine least-cost path models and archaeological surveys and excavations to determine the possible movements along the southern margin of General Carrera Lake. The methodology includes defining uncertainties that allow for modeling a set of equiprobable routes, thereby avoiding problems with errors and biases from predictors, such as slope, land-use cover, and seasonality. The results identify mobility corridor bottlenecks, i.e., geographical areas with a high probability of travel routes with equiprobable routes that converge. In addition, we identify areas where travel routes are likely to diverge into multiple semi-parallel routes. The study of archaeological sites provides stratigraphic data to control for the chronology and characteristics of mobility along this transect. The correlation between archaeological sites and paths, specifically for the control and winter scenarios, shows the quality of these route predictions. These results indicate the repeated use of internodal spaces that were effectively incorporated into mobility during the last three millennia.

Importance of groundwater in propagating downward integration of the 6-5 Ma Colorado River system: Geochemistry of springs, travertines, and lacustrine carbonates of the Grand Canyon region over the past 12 Ma	GEOSPHERE												We applied multiple geochemical tracers (Sr-87/Sr-86, [Sr], delta C-13, and delta O-18) to waters and carbonates of the lower Colorado River system to evaluate its paleohydrology over the past 12 Ma. Modern springs in Grand Canyon reflect mixing of deeply derived (endogenic) fluids with meteoric (epigenic) recharge. Travertine (<1 Ma) and speleothems (2-4 Ma) yield Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta C-13 and delta O-18 values that overlap with associated water values, providing justification for use of carbonates as a proxy for the waters from which they were deposited. The Hualapai Limestone (12-6 Ma) and Bouse Formation (5.6-4.8 Ma) record paleohydrology immediately prior to and during integration of the Colorado River. The Hualapai Limestone was deposited from 12 Ma (new ash age) to 6 Ma; carbonates thicken eastward to similar to 210 m toward the Grand Wash fault, suggesting that deposition was synchronous with fault slip. A fanning-dip geometry is suggested by correlation of ashes between subbasins using tephrochronology. New detrital-zircon ages are consistent with the "Muddy Creek constraint," which posits that Grand Wash Trough was internally drained prior to 6 Ma, with limited or no Colorado Plateau detritus, and that Grand Wash basin was sedimentologically distinct from Gregg and Temple basins until after 6 Ma. New isotopic data from Hualapai Limestone of Grand Wash basin show values and ranges of Sr-87/Sr-86, delta C-13, and delta O-18 that are similar to Grand Canyon springs and travertines, suggesting a long-lived spring-fed lake/marsh system sourced from western Colorado Plateau groundwater. Progressive up-section decrease in Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta C-13 and increase in delta O-18 in the uppermost 50 m of the Hualapai Limestone indicate an increase in meteoric water relative to endogenic inputs, which we interpret to record progressively increased input of high-elevation Colorado Plateau groundwater from ca. 8 to 6 Ma. Grand Wash, Hualapai, Gregg, and Temple basins, although potentially connected by groundwater, were hydrochemically distinct basins before ca. 6 Ma. The Sr-87/Sr-86, delta C-13, and delta O-18 chemostratigraphic trends are compatible with a model for downward integration of Hualapai basins by groundwater sapping and lake spillover. The Bouse Limestone (5.6-4.8 Ma) was also deposited in several hydrochemically distinct basins separated by bedrock divides. Northern Bouse basins (Cottonwood, Mojave, Havasu) have carbonate chemistry that is nonmarine. The Sr-87/Sr-86 data suggest that water in these basins was derived from mixing of high-Sr-87/Sr-86 Lake Hualapai waters with lower-Sr-87/Sr-86, first-arriving "Colorado River" waters. Covariation trends of delta C-13 and delta O-18 suggest that newly integrated Grand Wash, Gregg, and Temple basin waters were integrated downward to the Cottonwood and Mojave basins at ca. 5-6 Ma. Southern, potentially younger Bouse basins are distinct hydrochemically from each other, which suggests incomplete mixing during continued downward integration of internally drained basins. Bouse carbonates display a southward trend toward less radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86 values, higher [Sr], and heavier delta O-18 that we attribute to an increased proportion of Colorado River water through time plus increased evaporation from north to south. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 trends suggest alternating closed and open systems in progressively lower (southern) basins. We interpret existing data to permit the interpretation that the southernmost Blythe basin may have had intermittent mixing with marine water based on delta C-13 and delta O-18 covariation trends, sedimentology, and paleontology. [Sr] versus Sr-87/Sr-86 modeling suggests that southern Blythe basin Sr-87/Sr-86 values of similar to 0.710-0.711 could be produced by 25%-75% seawater mixed with river water (depending on [Sr] assumptions) in a delta-marine estuary system. We suggest several refinements to the "lake fill-and-spill" downward integration model for the Colorado River: (1) Lake Hualapai was fed by western Colorado Plateau groundwater from 12 to 8 Ma; (2) high-elevation Colorado Plateau groundwater was progressively introduced to Lake Hualapai from ca. 8 to 6 Ma; (3) Colorado River water arrived at ca. 5-6 Ma; and (4) the combined inputs led to downward integration by a combination of groundwater sapping and sequential lake spillover that first delivered Colorado Plateau water and detritus to the Salton Trough at ca. 5.3 Ma. We propose that the groundwater sapping mechanism strongly influenced lake evolution of the Hualapai and Bouse Limestones and that groundwater flow from the Colorado Plateau to Grand Wash Trough led to Colorado River integration.

The survey lasted from May 2018 to August 2019. Fifty-one samplings were carried out: 34 in the littoral zone and 17 in the central zone. The deformity assessment was based on 737 and 2767 larval specimens of C.plumosus collected from the littoral and central zones, respectively. Comparison of the larval morphometric variables between normal and deformed specimens highlighted that the deformities did not cause alterations of the larval growth. The deformity incidence amounted to 7.22% in the whole Trasimeno's ecosystem, reaching 8.28% in the littoral zone and 6.94% in the central zone. Among the different seasonal cohorts, the spring cohort had overall the highest deformity value (11.41%). The deformity type assessment protocol highlighted that the most common deformity type was "round/filed teeth" (64%). The results of this 2018-2019 survey revealed a low deformity incidence, within the background range of relatively low-impacted freshwaters. Comparison with previous investigations (2000-2010) of the same habitat showed a clear decrease of the deformity incidence. This study further contributes to the evaluation of the mentum deformity in chironomids that represent an indicator endpoint of the anthropogenic contamination level in freshwaters.

To elucidate the interactive effects of nutrients and salinity on phytoplankton assemblages, we conducted a four-season study during 2020-2021 of eight lakes from Yunnan Plateau (Southwest China) with a wide range of conductivities (Cond, reflecting degree of salinization), eutrophic states, and water depths and used General Additive Modeling (GAM) of the data. We found that: (1) species number (SN), density (D-Phyt), and biomass (B-Phyt) of phytoplankton showed stronger seasonal dynamics in shallow lakes than in deep lakes, all being, as expected, higher in the warm season; (2) annual and summer data revealed highly significant positive relationships between SN, D-Phyt, and B-Phyt with total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), which became weaker at high TP occurring when the N:P ratio was low, indicating N limitation; (3) SN, D-Phyt, and B-Phyt showed a unimodal relationship with salinity, peaking at 400-1000 mu S/cm (Cond); (4) the two dominant taxa (cyanobacteria and chlorophyta) showed different patterns, with chlorophyta generally dominating at low TN and cyanobacteria at high TN and Cond, suggesting the synergistic effect of nitrogen and Cond on cyanobacterial dominance.

Effects of Hydrological Drought Periods on Thermal Stability of Brazilian Reservoirs	WATER												Droughts can impact ecosystem services provided by reservoirs. Quantifying the intensity of droughts and evaluating their potential effects on the thermal stability of reservoirs are subjects that demand greater attention, due to both the importance of temperature on aquatic metabolism and the climate change scenarios that predict an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. This study aimed to investigate drought periods in ten Brazilian reservoirs and to discuss their effects on each reservoir's thermal stability. The Standardized Precipitation Index at a twelve month timescale (SPI-12) was applied to identify the hydrological drought periods. One-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic modeling was used to simulate the water balance and the thermal dynamics in the reservoirs. Schmidt Stability Index (St) was calculated to assess the thermal stability of the reservoirs. The drought periods identified by the SPI-12 are related to decreasing water levels of the reservoirs, but the dam operating strategies and the upstream influence of cascading reservoirs are important drivers of fluctuations. A significant difference in St between wet and dry conditions was found only during summer for all reservoirs. Thus, this study identified alterations in thermal regime during drought periods according to the seasons and the reservoirs characteristics.					; Koide, Sergio/F-2261-2015; Soares, Laura/C-5329-2019; Barbosa, Carolina/ABG-6691-2021; KOIDE, SERGIO/F-2261-2015; Mannich, Michael/L-9660-2014; Martins, Jose/F-5198-2013; Melo Vieira Soares, Laura/C-5329-2019; SCARATI MARTINS, JOSÉ RODOLFO/F-5198-2013; Bleninger, Tobias/H-3269-2012	Cerqueira Barbosa, Carolina/0000-0002-6393-5730; KOIDE, SERGIO/0000-0002-0424-5748; Cavalho, Joao Marcos/0000-0001-9526-5199; Martins, Jose/0000-0002-3331-1222; Rigotti, Jucimara Andreza/0000-0003-0140-0324; Melo Vieira Soares, Laura/0000-0003-0890-7865; Rocha Pereira, Alice/0000-0002-2731-8698; Pozzan dos Santos Duarte, Barbara/0000-0003-1214-7600; 														2073-4441				AUG	2023	15	16							2877	10.3390/w15162877	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15162877													WOS:001056788600001

Explaining Variation in Abundance and Species Diversity of Avian Cestodes in Brine Shrimps in the Salar de Atacama and Other Chilean Wetlands	WATER												Further biogeographical studies of parasites are vital to improve our understanding of biodiversity distribution and predict the impacts of global change. Hypersaline lakes are good laboratories to investigate the avian cestode abundance and species diversity given the abundance of hosts (waterbirds and Artemia) and their broad latitudinal distribution. We analysed cestode infection in brine shrimp Artemia franciscana in northern (Atacama) and central Chile and compared them to results from A. persimilis in southern Chile (Patagonia). Thus, we covered a broad latitudinal gradient from 23 degrees to 53 degrees S. Five cestode taxa including two species of the genus Flamingolepis, Gynandrotaenia stammeri, Eurycestus avoceti, and Fuhrmannolepis averini were recorded from A. franciscana in Atacama lagoons (prevalence = 4.1%). In contrast, no cestode infection was detected in central Chile, likely because they are temporary wetlands. Parasites of flamingos and shorebirds were associated with Atacama lagoons (arid and higher salinity), while Confluaria podicipina and Fimbriarioides sp. (parasites of grebes and ducks, respectively) were dominant in Patagonian lagoons (sub-antarctic and of lower salinity). These differences mirror changes in the relative abundance of the respective final hosts. The flamingo parasite Flamingolepis sp. 1 was the most prevalent and abundant cestode in Atacama, where it was recorded only in autumn. Seasonality and habitat effects (especially abundance and phenology of different bird species) appear to override any latitudinal trends in the prevalence, diversity, and distribution of cestodes. Cestode prevalence was higher in larger wetlands but was not related to the sex of either intermediate host. We recorded a greater taxonomic richness at the cestode family level in Atacama, but a greater dominance of a single family of avian hosts (the flamingos).

Aquatic environments of an urban city are apt for the persistence and prevalence of ARGs. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of ARGs and integrase genes in the sediment samples collected from drinking water sources, urban rivers, and coastal areas of Zhuhai, China, in the dry and wet seasons of 2016. The results show that sulfonamide resistance gene of sulII was present at the highest detection frequency (85.71%); and its average concentrations were also the highest in both dry and wet seasons (3.78x10(7) and 9.04x10(7) copies/g sediment, respectively), followed by tetC, tetO, tetA, ermB, dfrA1, and bla(PSE-1). Temporally, the concentrations of total ARGs in the wet season were likely higher than those in the dry season; and spatially, the concentrations of total ARGs in the drinking water sources were substantially lower than those in the urban rivers and nearby coastal areas, indicating the different degrees of anthropogenic impact and consequent health risks. Positive correlations were found between intI1 and each quantitative ARG in all wet season samples rather than dry season samples, which suggested higher temperature and more rain in summer might have positive influences on ARG dissemination, especially that mediated by intI1 gene and class I integrons.					; Sun, Weiling/E-7340-2018; Zhang, Yan/P-2718-2017; Li, Ao/GRR-5311-2022; Li, Si/ABF-7528-2020; Xie, Huijun/AGR-1795-2022	Tao, Yile/0000-0002-4418-3959; Li, Si/0000-0002-5753-5976; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2018	25	26					26209	26217		10.1007/s11356-018-2664-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2664-0								29974445					WOS:000443329100052

NASA's ICESat-2 laser altimeter brings a new capability: photons penetrate water and are reflected from both the water and the underlying ice; the difference provides a depth estimate. ICESat-2 sampled Amery Ice Shelf on January 2, 2019 and showed double returns from surface depressions, indicating meltwater. For four melt features, we compared depth estimates from eight algorithms: six based on ICESat-2 and two from coincident Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. All algorithms successfully identified surface water at the same locations. Algorithms based on ICESat-2 produced the most accurate depths; the image-based algorithms underestimated depths (by 30%-70%). This implies that ICESat-2 depths can be used to tune image-based algorithms, moving us closer to quantifying stored meltwater volumes across Antarctica and Greenland.					; Magruder, Lori/AAA-1634-2022; Wouters, Bert/A-5301-2017; Moussavi, Mahsa/B-4051-2016; Wouters, Bert/AAA-4254-2019; Arndt, Philipp/AAG-4254-2021	Pope, Allen/0000-0001-9699-7500; Fricker, Helen Amanda/0000-0002-0921-1432; Fair, Zachary/0000-0002-6047-1723; brunt, kelly/0000-0002-6462-6112; Wouters, Bert/0000-0002-1086-2435; Datta, Rajashree Tri/0000-0003-2241-0687; Arndt, Philipp/0000-0002-4759-5166													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 28	2021	48	8							e2020GL090550	10.1029/2020GL090550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090550													WOS:000672324900002

The study also covered analysis of toxigenicity and production of CYN by the culture of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii isolated from BY. The cyrJ gene associated with CYN production was identified in 22 water samples collected in the summer seasons of 2006 and 2007. The presence of CYN was confirmed in 16 samples. The homology searches revealed that amplified sequences of four water samples, which were selected from among all the samples, displayed a strong 99% homology to cyrJ gene of Aphanizomenon sp. 10E6. The culture of C. raciborskii did not contain the cyrJ gene nor the CYN. The specificity of C. raciborskii was confirmed by application of a fragment of the rpoC1. These first genetic analyses have shown that Aphanizomenon seems to be the main cyanobacterial genus responsible for the production of CYN in the Polish lakes. The lack of toxigenicity of the isolated C. raciborskii suggests that it is possible that this invasive species does not demonstrate toxigenic activity in Polish water bodies.					; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018	Gagala-Borowska, Ilona/0000-0003-0123-7440; Jurczak, Tomasz/0000-0002-1576-6741; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Dziadek, Jaroslaw/0000-0003-1427-884X													0378-1097					JAN	2012	326	2					173	179		10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02451.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02451.x								22092753					WOS:000298303200011

The spring period is also characterized by increased availability of organic carbon species that are in parts derived from cellular debris generated during bacterivory or viral lysis, such as peptidoglycan, chitin and their subunit N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). We tested the hypothesis that two dominant grazing resistant bacterial taxa, the ac1 tribe of Actinobacteria (ac1) and filamentous bacteria from the LD2 lineage (Saprospiraceae), profit from such carbon sources during periods of intense HNF predation. The abundances of ac1 and LD2 rose in parallel with HNF, and disproportionally high fractions of cells from both lineages were involved in NAG uptake. Members of ac1 and LD2 were significantly more enriched after NAG addition to lake water. However, highest growth rates of both bacterial lineages were found on chitin and peptidoglycan. Moreover, the direct or indirect transfer of organic carbon from peptidoglycan to LD2 filaments could be demonstrated. We thus provide evidence that these taxa may benefit twofold from protistan predation: by removal of their competitors, and by specific physiological adaptations to utilize carbon sources that are released during grazing or viral lysis.

Phylogenetic position and taxonomy of three heterocytous cyanobacteria dominating the littoral of deglaciated lakes, James Ross Island, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Several communities of autotrophic microorganisms, in which cyanobacteria are dominant or play a substantial role in their structure, were studied on the deglaciated Ulu Peninsula, northern part of James Ross Island, NW Weddell Sea, Antarctica, in 2007-2009. Our results were compared with similar data from maritime Antarctica (King George Island, South Shetland Islands, 2005). Characteristics and taxonomic description of three important heterocytous species, which participate in cyanoprokaryotic assemblages in the littoral of small lakes, seepages, and on wetted rocks during the Antarctic summer season, are included in this study. They belong to the form-genera Calothrix and Hassallia, respectively, and are unidentifiable according to the present determination literature. Therefore, after a polyphasic evaluation, they are described as three new species, Calothrix elsteri sp. nova, Hassallia andreassenii sp. nova, and Hassallia antarctica sp. nova. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolated strains confirmed the taxonomic position of all three species, and their ecology and seasonal development are described. All three discovered species are dominant in distinct communities with a specialized ecology and may be endemic for coastal maritime Antarctica.

Long-chain n-alkanes dominate the aliphatic hydrocarbon fraction of the sediment extract from most surface sediment samples and the sediment core. Unsaturated mid-chain n-alkanes (nC(23:1) and nC(25:1)) have high abundances in some samples, especially in core samples from the late glacial and early Holocene. TOC contents, organic biomarker and non-pollen-palynomorph concentrations and results from organic petrologic analysis on selected samples suggest three major episodes in the history of Lake Donggi Cona. Before ca. 12.6 cal ka BP samples contain low amounts of organic matter due to cold and arid conditions during the late glacial. After 12.6 cal ka BP, relatively high contents of TOC and concentrations of Botryococcus fossils, as well as enhanced concentrations of mid-chain n-alkanes and n-alkenes suggest a higher primary and macrophyte productivity than at present This is supported by high contents of palynomorphs derived from higher plants and algae and was possibly triggered by a decrease of salinity and amelioration of climate during the early Holocene. Since 6.8 cal ka BP Lake Donggi Cona has been an oligotrophic freshwater lake. Proxy data suggest that variations in insolation drive ecological changes in the lake, with increased aquatic productivity during the early Holocene summer insolation maximum. Short-term drops of TOC contents or biomarker concentrations (at 9.9 cal ka BP, after 8.0 and between 3.5 and 1.7 cal ka BP) can possibly be related to relatively cool and dry episodes reported from other sites on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau, which are hypothesized to occur in phase with Northern Hemisphere cooling events.

Genetic variation of leaf pigment content in a southern beech	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												Key message Leaf pigment concentration varied among populations, watersheds and between two consecutive years. The highest concentration of pigments was found in 2018, but both years showed the same trend among populations. Physiological, morphological and phenological attributes are potentially adaptive traits that determine functional responses to certain environmental conditions. They are crucial for understanding adaptations to environmental variation along a species natural range. Our goal was to evaluate the variation in pigment traits among Nothofagus alpina populations in a common garden trial to infer local adaptation. We also aimed to test variation in pigment traits between two consecutive years and to analyze the correlation between pigment and phenological traits (i.e., day of the year to bud burst and to beginning of senescence, growing degree days, growing season length). We analyzed 400 individuals (65 open-pollinated families) from eight natural populations coming from four lake watersheds comprising the species range in Argentina. Pigment traits were estimated using a spectrophotometer and analyzed with linear mixed models (LMMs). Significant differences among fixed factors (populations and watersheds) were found in chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, carotenoids and anthocyanins concentrations. Two populations were always the most contrasting ones. These results and the influence of the family factor on the variance of the pigment traits are evidence of the genetic control as well as of the potential adaptive value of leaf pigment content in N. alpina, giving a base for adaptation to a long-lasting change in climate. The highest values for all pigments were found in 2018, but among populations they showed the same trend for both years. Significant correlations between the population means of pigment concentrations and phenological traits were found.

J	Nepf, HM; Oldham, CE				Nepf, HM; Oldham, CE			Exchange dynamics of a shallow contaminated wetland	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Flux pathways are investigated for a wetland system comprised of a river flowing through two shallow forebays and then entering the main basin of a lake. The hydrodynamic exchanges between these three components influence the fate and transport of heavy metals in the system. During non-storm summer flows the river plume, comprised of river water and entrained forebay water, was cooler than the lake surface water and so plunged as it entered the main basin and inserted near the seasonal thermocline. Because the river plume plunged, only a fraction of its metals flux was available to the epilimnion. A return now into the forebay was always observed immediately above the river inflow, ensuring a predominantly two-layer exchange system. However during days of negative heat flux (surface heating), an additional exchange mechanism existed when the surface waters from the forebay formed a buoyant plume, flowing out into the main basin. This heated outflow produced a significant, but short-lived, arsenic nux from the forebay into the surface waters of the lake.

Factors potentially regulating phytoplankton primary production were investigated in situ in 2 enrichment bioassays. The results suggest that the macrophyte vegetation provided an unfavourable habitat for large colonial chlorophytes. Small species, mainly cryptophytes but also small chlorophytes and cyanobacteria, characterised the summer phytoplankton. Phytoplankton abundance as well as primary production were considerable and remained in the mesotrophic range. The total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio during the growth season, and the enrichment bioassays, showed that phosphorus was a significant regulator of primary production. Small-celled species had competitive advantages in the dense vegetation, and the canopy structure created by dense stands of common water milfoil allowed phytoplankton growth. Hence, although the macrophytes altered the physical and chemical conditions in the lake, coexistence of small-celled algae and macrophytes was possible.																			2044-2041						2012	2	3					137	146		10.5268/IW-2.3.490	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-2.3.490													WOS:000307721800004

Royle in Spring Creek, a 2,343-ha embayment of Lake Seminole, Georgia. Coverage of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) declined from 76% to 22% in 1 year due to a drip-delivery fluridone treatment. In contrast, largemouth bass growth only increased an average of 4% and bioenegetics modeling predicted a 13% increase in total food consumption over the same time period in the Chattahoochee River embyament, where SAV coverage naturally declined from 26% to 15%. Diets were collected from a total of 4,409 largemouth bass over a 2.5-year period in the two embayments; the primary diet item (by weight) for largemouth bass in both embayments was sunfish (mostly Lepomis spp.). Diets before and after SAV reduction were generally similar for fish greater than stock-size (>= 203 mm) in the Spring Creek arm; however, fewer invertebrates were consumed after SAV reduction. Low diet similarity was observed in smaller fish, caused by a decline in consumption of grass shrimp and sunfishes and an increase in use of damselflies, shiners Notropis spp., and topminnows Fundulus spp. after SAV reduction. Diets were similar between the same time periods for all sizes of fish in the Chattahoochee River arm. These results agreed with many laboratory results describing the effects of aquatic plant density on largemouth bass food consumption and growth, and demonstrated that increased predation efficiency resulting from decreased plant abundance was likely a stronger factor determining growth rates than any potential diet shift that may occur as a result in vegetation decline.

Radar sounding survey over Devon Ice Cap indicates the potential for a diverse hypersaline subglacial hydrological environment	CRYOSPHERE												Prior geophysical surveys provided evidence for a hypersaline subglacial lake complex beneath the center of Devon Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic; however, the full extent and characteristics of the hydrological system remained unknown due to limited data coverage. Here, we present results from a new, targeted aerogeophysical survey that provides evidence (i) supporting the existence of a subglacial lake complex and (ii) for a network of shallow brine/saturated sediments covering similar to 170 km(2). Newly resolved lake shorelines indicate three closely spaced lakes covering a total area of 24.6 km(2).

Desiccation of ecosystem-critical microbialites in the shrinking Great Salt Lake, Utah (USA)	PLOS WATER												Great Salt Lake hosts an ecosystem that is critical to migratory birds and international aquaculture, yet it is currently threatened by falling lake elevation and high lakewater salinity resulting from water diversions in the upstream watershed and the enduring megadrought in the western United States. Microbialite reefs underpin the ecosystem, hosting a surface microbial community that is estimated to contribute 30% of the lake's primary productivity. We monitored exposure, desiccation, and bleaching over time in an area of microbialite reef. During this period, lake elevation fell by 1.8 m, and salinity increased from 11.0% to 19.5% in open-water portions of the outer reef, reaching halite saturation in hydrologically closed regions. When exposed, microbialite bleaching was rapid. Bleached microbialites are not necessarily dead, however, with communities and chlorophyll persisting beneath microbialite surfaces for several months of exposure and desiccation. However, superficial losses in the mat community resulted in enhanced microbialite weathering. In microbialite recovery experiments with bleached microbialite pieces, partial community recovery was rapid at salinities <= 17%. 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that recovery was driven by initial seeding from lakewater. At higher salinity levels, eventual accumulation of chlorophyll may reflect accumulation and preservation of lake material in halite crusts vs. true recovery. Our results indicate that increased water input should be prioritized in order to return the lake to an elevation that submerges microbialite reefs and lowers salinity levels. Without quick action to reverse diversions in the watershed, loss of pelagic microbial community members due to sustained high salinity could prevent the recovery of the ecosystem-critical microbialite surface communities in Great Salt Lake.

Thermal infrared images were taken of a 1000 m(2) polygonal tundra area in 10 min intervals from July to September 2008 Under clear sky conditions, the individual measurements indicate temperature differences of up to 6 K between dry and wet tundra surfaces and which can exceed 12 K when dry tundra and water surfaces are compared These differences disappear when temperature averages are considered for intervals longer than the diurnal cycle, for weekly averages the spatial temperature variability decreases below 1 K The exception is the free water surface of a shallow polygonal pond where weekly averaged temperature differences of 25 K are sustained compared to the tundra surface. The ground based thermal infrared images are upscaled to MODIS sized pixels and compared to available MODIS LST data for individual measurements and weekly averages The comparisons show generally good agreement for the individual measurements under clear sky conditions, which exist during 20% of the studied time period However, several erroneous measurements and large data gaps occur in the MODIS LST data during cloudy conditions, leading to biased weekly temperature averages inferred from the satellite observations Based on these results the following recommendations are given for future permafrost temperature monitoring based on MODIS LST products (i) high resolution surface water masks for the quality assessment in landscapes where lakes and ponds are frequent and (ii) reliable cloud cover detection in conjunction with a gap filling procedure for accurate temporal averages.

J	Sondergaard, M; Jeppesen, E; Aaser, HF				Sondergaard, M; Jeppesen, E; Aaser, HF			Neomysis integer in a shallow hypertrophic brackish lake: distribution and predation by three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The mysid shrimp Neomysis integer is a common invertebrate predator in brackish waters of Western Europe and is thought to play a central role in the food web owing to its predation on zooplankton. Neomysis distribution and abundance were investigated for 3 years in brackish, shallow and hypertrophic Lake Ferring (surface area: 3.2 km(2), mean depth: 1.4 m, salinity: 3-6 parts per thousand, total P: 0.29-0.78 mg P l(-1), Secchi depth: 0.14-0.22 m). Mean summer abundance of Neomysis varied from 53 to 882 ind. m(-2). Neomysis density within the lake was relatively uniform and not related to sediment type, but increased with increasing depth. The high abundance of Neomysis is considered to reflect a fish stock almost completely dominated by small-sized fish species (mainly three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus). Three-spined stickleback density was high and catch per unit effort ranged between 30 and 80 per gill net. Stomach analyses showed that the sticklebacks preyed on Neomysis, but preferred specimens smaller than 3-4 mm, and only occasionally consumed those larger than 5-7 mm. In summer, between 33 and 67% of the Neomysis ingested by sticklebacks were smaller than 3 mm, while in the lake as a whole, only 5-14% were smaller than 3 mm. The periods when Neomysis is vulnerable to stickleback predation are restricted to a few weeks in late May and late July, when the new generations emerge. Sticklebacks therefore have a limited capacity for controlling large Neomysis, including gravid females.

However, efforts to characterize the contribution of these aquaculture ponds towards greenhouse gas emission like CH4 are still very few. CH4 concentration in water [pCH(4)(water)] and air-water CH4 fluxes were estimated (during the summer months) in two sewage-fed ponds having different depths situated in the East Kolkata Wetlands, India (a Ramsar site). pCH(4)(water) in both of these ponds showed significant positive correlation with water temperature (R-2 = 0.68 and 0.71, p < 0.05). Daily mean chlorophyll-a, turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and gross primary productivity (GPP) also showed positive correlation with pCH(4)(water). This indicated that higher primary production and presence of turbid materials acted as substrates for methanogenesis, which favoured air-water CH4 effluxes towards atmosphere. Mean air-water CH4 fluxes in the ponds having depth of 1.1 m and 0.6 m were observed to be 24.79 +/- 12.02 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 6.05 +/- 3.14 mg m(-2) h(-1) respectively. Higher depth facilitated net heterotrophic conditions, which led to lower dissolved oxygen levels, which, in turn, led to lower rate of CH4 oxidation. Moreover, under reduced photosynthetically active radiation (in the pond having greater depth), the pH values were comparatively lower (~7.7), which further facilitated a favourable condition for the methanogens to grow. On the whole, it was inferred that apart from pre-established physicochemical factors, depth was also found to play a decisive role in regulating the air-water CH4 fluxes from these aquaculture ponds. In future, continuous sampling should be carried out (by chamber method) to take into account the ebullition CH4 fluxes, and more number of ponds should be sampled throughout a complete annual cycle to have a more holistic understanding about this cluster of sewage-fed aquaculture ponds.

Fresh samples were collected from frozen Tagish Lake in British Columbia a week later and some properties of these samples reveal it to be a unique meteorite. We characterized Tagish Lake and 8 other samples using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and radiochemical neutron activation analysis: data for 47 elements reveal that each of 9 carbonaceous chondrites of different type exhibit the Orgueil-normalized plateaus expected for members of such types. Trends evident in Tagish Lake differ from all other carbonaceous chondrites, including Cl and CM.

J	Tal, A				Tal, Alon			The implications of climate change driven depletion of Lake Kinneret water levels: the compelling case for climate change-triggered precipitation impact on Lake Kinneret's low water levels	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The dramatic drop in water levels in the Kinneret Lake (Sea of Galilee) during the past years is evaluated. Recently published measurements of temperature, precipitation and other hydrological data support the position that climate change is driving the contraction of this iconic water resource. The article presents a range of evidence confirming long-term shifts in the hydrological dynamics of the watershed and details the associated ecological implications. In response to these trends, Israel's government has decided to build a desalination plant along the Northern Mediterranean shoreline that will provide water to replenish the depleted water levels in lake. Given the likelihood of continued global warming expediting increased evaporation and reduced precipitation, such climate adaptation policies constitute prudent public policy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study employed the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate the Taihu Lake Basin's urbanization effect on climate. The results show that as the area of urbanization increases, the downwind precipitation in the study area increases significantly. In addition, the urbanization of the land surface has a strong impact on the surface energy balance, which can not only strengthen the transportation of the sensible heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere but even affect the transportation of water vapor, resulting in a decrease in specific humidity at 2 m from the ground surface. The simulation results have important theoretical significance in understanding the impact of urbanization on regional climate.

Yet their effects on lake eutrophication are not fully understood. Here, we applied the PCLake+ model to investigate the interactive effects of nutrient loading, nutrient imbalance (varied TN:TP ratios in loading inputs), and surface warming on eutrophication of Lake Waihai, the biggest part of Lake Dianchi, which has experienced long-term eutrophication under significant anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Results showed that increasing TN:TP ratio from 5:1 to 15:1 accelerated algal growth, resulting in a 33.1% increase in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration during summer. Rising annual lake temperatures (from 16.87 degrees C to 18.09 degrees C) promoted algal biomass accumulation, leading to a 30.9% increase in Chl-a concentration during summer. The combined effects of high TN:TP ratio (>= 15:1) and elevated water temperature (annual average of 18.09 degrees C) exhibited antagonism in high-nutrient-input conditions (TP >= 1.47 mg<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1)) but synergism under low-nutrient-input scenarios (TP < 1.09 mg<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1)). These findings suggest that global warming and elevated TN:TP ratios could significantly hinder lake restoration efforts, highlighting the urgency of reducing nitrogen inputs to mitigate the negative impacts on lake ecosystems in a warming climate.					; hou, xikang/ABF-9017-2021	Gao, Wei/0000-0002-6260-0592; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2025	852	20					5073	5088		10.1007/s10750-025-05901-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-025-05901-6		JUN 2025											WOS:001506102000001

Mantle-derived fluids discharged at the Bradanic foredeep/Apulian foreland boundary: The Maschito geothermal gas emissions (southern Italy)	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The mephitis of Maschito, known since historical times as Lago Fetente (Smelly Lake) -although the lake is now dry-, is located 20 km from the Mt. Vulture volcanic edifice (Southern Italy). It is placed along the same regional tectonic discontinuity where some maars are located, close to the boundary between the foredeep and the Apulian foreland. About 300 m(2) of surface is lacking in flora, while dead animals are frequently found all around it. The smelly exhalations are mainly composed of CO2 (similar to 98%), and, in lesser amounts, of H2S, N-2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons. He, Ne and Ar occur in trace amounts. The CO2 isotopic composition is in the range of that of the main active Italian volcanic gases. The helium isotopic ratio (4.7 Ra) fits with the values measured in Mt. Vulture volcano and particularly with the olivine and pyroxene fluid inclusions of mantle xenoliths ejected during its last volcanic activity (140,000 years). The Ar-40/Ar-36 isotopic ratio of similar to 320 supports some minor non-atmospheric contributions. The C/He-3 ratio (2.9 x 10(9)) is in the typical range of magma released fluids, while delta C-13((CH4)) and delta D-(CH)4 values fall in the field of thermogenic methane. The amount of CO2 released is about 3200 tons/year. The flux of mantle-derived helium (>7 x 10(10) atoms m(-2) S-1) is at least three orders of magnitude higher than that of a stable continental crust. This study strongly supports the possibility that Maschito manifestations are fed by a geothermal system, which is powered by a degassing melt, bearing in mind that the Maschito gas emissions fall along the same fault system of the Monticchio maars, which formed during Mt. Vulture volcano's last activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The benthic community was comprised principally of oligochaetes (56.1%), chironomids (37.1%) and chaoborids (5.7%). Numbers of taxa and mean densities correlated negatively with depth and positively with mean grain size of the substratum and dissolved O2 concentration at the mud-water interface. Seasonal abundances and life history information obtained for the predominant species of Chironomidae (Polypedilum halterale, Glyptotendipes paripes, Chironomus crassicaudatus, Cryptochironomus fulvus, C. blarina, Cladotanytarsus sp., Procladius culiciformis and Coelotanypus concinnus) indicated that all of these species are multivoltine with rapid generation times. Larval lengths of life at summer temperatures of 27.degree.-31.degree. C were 14-22 days, indicating that sampling in subtropical lakes should be at short intervals (approximately 3 days) if the life cycles, ecology and function of the components of the benthic community are to be understood.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	78	2					97	105		10.1007/BF00007582	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007582													WOS:A1981LJ60900001

Eutrophication of Tenkiller Reservoir, Oklahoma, from nonpoint agricultural runoff	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Cooke GD, Welch EB, Jones JR. 2011. Eutrophication of Tenkiller Reservoir, Oklahoma, from nonpoint agricultural runoff. Lake Reserv Manage. 27: 256-270. Tenkiller Ferry Reservoir, a large (51.6 km(2)) US midcontinent reservoir in Oklahoma, switched from oligomesotrophic prior to 1975 to eutrophic by 1986, evidenced by changes in phytoplankton taxa, chlorophyll (Chl), total phosphorus (TP), transparency, and areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit. External TP loading increased 2.5-fold between 1974 and 2004, mainly as nonpoint loading from disposal of an annual (2001-2004) average 406,818 metric tons (mt) of untreated poultry litter on watershed pastures, which added an annual (2001-2006) average 4120 mt of TP. Phosphorus runoff from litter, estimated as 5% of applied, was 63% of external loading to the Illinois River from 2001-2004, 71 % after the 2004 waste water treatment plant upgrade. The 9 % load decrease from the upgrade did not affect Chl. Sediment TP release, seldom determined for reservoirs, accounted for 16 % of annual external plus internal TP load. Trophic state graded from riverine to lacustrine zone. In wet summers with low residence times, the lacustrine zone was eutrophic; in dry summers it was mesotrophic. Transition and riverine zones were always eutrophic or hypereutrophic. Trophic state assessment ideally requires multiple sampling years in all reservoir zones. A similar Oklahoma reference reservoir, Broken Bow, with modest watershed poultry activities and low inflow TP concentrations, was oligo-mesotrophic. Rehabilitation of Tenkiller Reservoir requires large reductions of TP loading by ceasing watershed litter disposal, changes in watershed management practices, and application of in-reservoir procedures.

We collected cladoceran as well as cyclopoid and calanoid copepod zooplankton from boreal and subarctic lakes throughout a year, allowing us to study zooplankton likely subjected to different isotopic fractionation processes and with highly variable lipid contents. Considerable seasonal variation was observed in the difference between bulk and lipid-extracted zooplankton delta(13)C values, indicating that seasonally changing lipid content introduced notable variation in zooplankton delta(13)C values. The difference between bulk and lipid-extracted material was most amplified in lipid-rich subarctic zooplankton in winter, delta(13)C difference being >5 units. Significant differences were also observed among zooplankton taxa, with copepods showing a greater lipid impact on delta(13)C than cladocerans. Published lipid correction models failed to produce satisfying fits to our data, and considerable variation was left even after recalibrating the model parameters. This was likely due to taxonomic differences in lipid effects on delta(13)C values. We therefore produced separate mass balance-based lipid correction models for cladocerans and also cyclopoid and calanoid copepods. We conclude that arithmetic lipid correction models perform well with zooplankton samples, but taxonomic differences need to be considered.																			0706-652X					NOV	2010	67	11					1721	1729		10.1139/F10-091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F10-091													WOS:000283921200001

The water quality conditions appear in near-infrared (NIR) data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Because blue-green algae occur in summer, the water quality of the small lake will be significantly worse at that time. On the basis of the experimental results for data from the months of July and August obtained using a fuzzy regression model, it is found that the UAV data is useful in assessing the water quality conditions in Lake Sakurako, and that the NIR data is effective in estimating the water surface conditions of the lake, especially caused by the occurrence of blue-green algae.

J	DOUTHWAITE, RJ				DOUTHWAITE, RJ			EFFECTS OF DDT ON THE FISH EAGLE HALIAEETUS-VOCIFER POPULATION OF LAKE KARIBA IN ZIMBABAWE	IBIS												Twenty clutches were collected from nests of Fish Eagles Haliaeetus vocifer at Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe, and a small dam nearby in 1989-90. Unaltered DDT, and metabolites DDD and DDE, were found in every egg. Mean levels of SIGMA-DDT(= DDT + DDD + DDE) generally varied from 14 to 49 mg/kg dry weight per clutch, but 113-223 mg/kg dry weight were found in clutches from the eastern end of the lake and the mouth of the Senga River. SIGMA-DDT and DDE levels were significantly correlated with the Ratcliffe Index of eggshell thickness. Comparison with museum specimens showed that the Ratcliffe Index has declined by 11% since 1936-41 due to a significant fall in shell weight. Eggshell thinning exceeded 20% at the eastern end of the lake. Aerial surveys in 1987 and 1990 found that hatching success along the southern lakeshore exceeded 72%, but chicks were seen in fewer than half the nests at the eastern end. However, the density of breeding pairs was greatest here. Residue levels have increased by about 8% since 1980, rising more steeply in areas recently sprayed for tsetse fly control and falling in others. The threat from DDT may now be receding as regional use has declined and will end, for tsetse fly control, by 1995. None was used for this purpose in 1991. Mercury levels in adult birds were very high and may pose a significant risk. The breeding population may be limited by availability of safe nest sites. Chicks are sometimes eaten by people. Settlement along the lakeshore is increasing and safe sites are becoming scarcer as dead trees in the lake collapse and large trees onshore are destroyed by elephants.																			0019-1019					JUL	1992	134	3					250	258		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb03807.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb03807.x													WOS:A1992JF03500005
J	COCHRANE, KL				COCHRANE, KL			THE INFLUENCE OF FOOD AVAILABILITY, BREEDING SEASONS AND GROWTH-RATE ON COMMERCIAL CATCHES OF LIMNOTHRISSA-MIODON (BOULENGER) IN LAKE KARIBA	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Commercial catches of L. miodon in Lake Kariba show clear seasonal fluctuations. Recruitment to the pelagic fishing areas was investigated. A von Bertalanffy growth curve for the species was calculated and the breeding season determined from the calculated hatching dates of observed alevins and juveniles. Distribution of the different size classes was determined by a horizontal transect. Analysis of body composition showed a decrease in total lipids at the time when catches were dropping. This was shown to be due to a decline in triglyceride fat reserves apparently resulting from food stress and possibly resulting in increased natural mortality. Recruitment to the fishing areas and the total mortality rate are believed to cause the seasonal fluctuations in catch. The annual cycle of production may be caused by the summer inflow of nutrients from the rivers. Growth is apparently stunted in comparison to the species'' growth rate in Lake Tanganyika, probably due to the lower nutrient status of Lake Kariba.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1984	24	6					623	635		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1984.tb04833.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1984.tb04833.x													WOS:A1984SY45700002
J	CEBRIAN, J; DUARTE, CM				CEBRIAN, J; DUARTE, CM			PLANT GROWTH-RATE DEPENDENCE OF DETRITAL CARBON STORAGE IN ECOSYSTEMS	SCIENCE												Detrital carbon accumulation accounts for most of an ecosystem's capacity to store organic carbon because the carbon contained as plant detritus exceeds that stored in living plants by about threefold. A comparative analysis of the mass and turnover of detrital carbon in ecosystems demonstrates that these properties are strongly related to the turnover rate of the dominant primary producers and are poorly related to ecosystem primary production. These results contribute to an understanding of the factors that control carbon storage in ecosystems and the role of carbon storage in the global carbon budget.

REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE												Small resource-based communities across Canada are experiencing rapid change within a volatile, fluctuating global economy. As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change.

Unraveling the interaction of urban emission plumes and marine breezes involved in the formation of summertime coastal high ozone on Long Island	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ATMOSPHERES												The New York City (NYC) urban region and locations downwind (i.e., Long Island) are currently characterized as one of the critical regions for studying ozone pollution with special emphasis on the interplay of the urban plume and marine breeze on warm summer days. We use the data from a new air quality monitoring site at the Long Island south shore to provide a contrast to the existing measurements along the north shore and middle of the island. We find different mechanisms for high ozone cases at the north shore vs. those resulting in high ozone at the south shore. The north shore high ozone cases mainly result from (1) a calm condition favoring high ozone formation over NYC urban regions and western Long Island, (2) a sea-breeze front originating from south Long Island diverting the high ozone plume to the north shore, and (3) the stagnation of the sea-breeze front over the Long Island north shore (and coastal Connecticut) for several hours. The cases with higher elevated ozone on the south shore are rarely reported due to the limited measurements and are highlighted in this study. They resulted from more varied wind flow patterns, but in each case involved westerly or southwesterly flow and polluted air transported to the site over the ocean in the late afternoon (around 17:00 local time). Different from the previous studies over other regions in the world where the high ozone area generally happened further inland following the sea breeze front movement, the narrow high ozone band mainly covering Long Island south coastal line can be more harmful to the clustered people enjoying the summer beach. This study highlights the necessity of setting up more air quality monitors sites along the Long Island south shore and provides guidance for other shore regions for focusing on the potential for narrow high ozone bands concentrated over near coastal areas.

Over three consecutive summers, water was collected from a series of ponds on degrading syngenetic permafrost, representing the most common geomorphological categories: erosive or stable ice-wedge trough ponds and coalescent polygon ponds. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrients were quantified, and DOM was characterized using optical analysis. These ponds were rich in carbon and nutrients, particularly the ice-wedge trough ponds with eroding permafrost. They also exhibited higher concentrations of DOC (+25% on average), total nitrogen (+36%), ammonium (+1164%), and total phosphorus (+108%) in the hypolimnion compared to the epilimnion. DOM was mainly of terrestrial origin (57%-75% of total fluorescent DOM), though protein-like fluorescent components increased in ponds colonized by vegetation and cyanobacterial mats. Weather conditions significantly influenced DOC (+26% in a wet and warm year) and DOM composition in summer, with warmer temperatures and higher precipitation enhancing lateral DOM transfer from permafrost soils and promoting contributions from cyanobacterial mats. These findings improve the understanding of Arctic pond biogeochemistry, enabling a more accurate assessment of their potential role in climate feedback mechanisms.

Reconstruction of walleye exploitation based on angler diary records and a model of predicted catches	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES												The walleye population in Canadarago Lake, New York, was 81-95% exploited in the 1988 fishing season, the year in which a previous restriction on the length and number of legally harvestable fish was liberalized. Using diary records from a subset of fishermen, growth estimates, and an estimate of the walleye population in the following year, a method is developed to reconstruct the fish population back to the spring of 1988 and thus determine the exploitation rate. The method is based on a model of diary catches that partitions time and fish length into a set of cells and relates predicted catches and population sizes in these cells. The method's sensitivity to the partitioning scheme, the growth estimates, and the diary data is analyzed. The method could be employed in other fish exploitation analyses and demonstrates the use of inexpensive angler-collected data in fisheries management. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These fluctuations are dominated by the earth's local elastic response to the changing weight of water in a reservoir located about 20km away. There is also an annual periodic component of motion that is attributed to global and regional patterns of loading, as well as a steady tectonic signal.

J	Missaghi, S; Hondzo, M; Herb, W				Missaghi, Shahram; Hondzo, Miki; Herb, William			Prediction of lake water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and fish habitat under changing climate	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We applied a three-dimensional lake water quality model to investigate the influence of local meteorological conditions on fish habitat under one historical and two future climate change scenarios. Compared to the historical normal climate scenario, the averaged surface water temperature increases up to 4 degrees C and the dissolved oxygen concentration is 1 mg L-1 less during the ice-free seasons under the future climate scenarios. The stratification periods expand up to 23% (46 days), thermocline depths increase 49%, and the onset of anoxia occurs 4 weeks earlier under the future climate scenarios. The dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures are used as the key water quality parameters to investigate the temporal and spatial variabilities of fish habitat. The good growth, restricted growth, and lethal habitats for the coolwater fish change up to 14% of the total lake volume. Compared to the historical normal climate scenario, on average, the lake total volume for good growth, restricted growth, and lethal habitat of coolwater fish change +16, -18, and +85%, respectively. The most significant (70%) changes in lethal habitat for coolwater fish occurs in the upper 5 m of the water column. During summer, a modest increase of lethal habitat for coolwater fish (8% of total lake volume) has a pronounced impact on the good growth habitat. The prediction of spatial locations and time periods of potential fish habitats during stressed or lethal environmental conditions is becoming increasingly important for managing fish habitats under changing climate.

Circulation is possible during the winter (Dec.-March), but will be interrupted if the lake becomes ice-covered. It will mix only a near-surface layer (down to 20 m); between 20 and 140 m, vertical water exchange diminishes and beneath 140 m it is very poor. This lake tends to build up a monimolimnion.

Rapid increase in contaminant burdens following loss of body condition in canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) overwintering on the Lake St. Clair region of the Great Lakes	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Overwintering canvasbacks were collected in the Lake St. Clair region of the Great Lakes in the winter of 2008/09 and livers were analyzed for organochlorines, mercury (Hg), and selenium (Se). We found dramatic increases in hepatic concentrations of Hg, Se, sum PCBs, p,p'-DDE, and other organochlorines in canvasbacks in which concentrations in February were greater than concentrations in November when overwintering ducks arrived in the study area. Increases in contaminant burdens were generally greatest between December and January which also coincided with the period when ducks from Lake St. Clair (LSC) moved following freeze-up of the Lake to forage on the St. Clair River (SCR), an area of known historic contamination, and upstream of LSC. Body condition estimated using body metrics and measured using lipid reserves (after controlling for body size) increased in LSC ducks but subsequently decreased in SCR ducks. This rapid loss of body condition through loss of lipid reserves was one factor likely driving the dramatic increase in contaminant burdens and particularly for organochlorines which were inversely related to body condition in SCR ducks. Increased exposure due to foraging in closer proximity to contaminant sources and changes in diet associated with the movement of ducks may have also contributed to temporal trends. Concentrations overall were below those associated with toxicity with the exception of Se for which 30% of ducks exceeded the Se threshold that is considered elevated and one duck exceeded the threshold associated with possible toxicity. Fitness consequences of reduced lipid reserves include reduced survival, delayed migration, reduced breeding propensity, and transfer of contaminant burdens to eggs. Food availability, ice cover, and movements of canvasbacks are additional factors influencing contaminant accumulation and lipid reserves in waterfowl utilizing this important wintering location.

Characteristics of chemical weathering and water-rock interaction in Lake Nyos dam (Cameroon): Implications for vulnerability to failure and re-enforcement	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												For the first time, comprehensive study of hydrogeochemistry of water seeps, role of chemical weathering on dam failure, estimation of minimum width of dam to resist failure and simulation of changes in dissolved ions and secondary mineral was conducted on the Lake Nyos dam. The salient results and conclusions were; the dam spring water represented a mixture of 60-70% rainwater and 30-40% Lake water (from 0 to -40 m). The chemistry of the observed waters was Ca-HCO3 for rainwater, Ca-Mg-HCO3 in boreholes, and Mg-Ca-HCO3- for spring water. The relative rate at which ions dissolved in water was HCO3- > Mg2+> Ca2+ > Na+> SiO2 > K > NO3- > SO42- > Cl-. Weathering of rocks resulted in the formation of clay minerals such as kaolinite and smectite. Relative mobility of elements compared to Alumina (Al2O3) indicated that in monzonites there was a loss of CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5 and gain of SiO2, Fe2O3, TiO2, MnO and MgO, while in basalts there was a loss of SiO2, Fe2O3, Ca2O, NaO, MgO and gain of TiO2, K2O and P2O5. Values of chemical alteration index that ranged from 49 to 82 suggest a weak to intermediate categories of chemical weathering that occurred at a rate of 5.7 mm/year. Paired to that rate, which suggests that the dam is not vulnerable to failure at the previously thought time scale, some other processes (physical weathering, secondary mineral formation and lake overflow) can cause instant failure. Hydrostatic pressure of 1.6 GN generated by Lake water can be supported only when the width of the dam is greater than 19 m. PHREEQC-based simulation for 10 years indicates decoupling of Ca and Mg, and Na and Mg. Multidisciplinary monitoring of the dam is advocated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The rivers showed significant diurnal changes in water level, temperature, and turbidity; clear and cool streams in the morning changed to cloudy rapid flow in the afternoon, and water temperature was elevated under strong light conditions where riparian forest did not cover the surface of the water. On the other hand, the pH and dissolved oxygen saturation did not show any diurnal fluctuations, which indicates low periphytic algal productivity. The aquatic insect communities were poor both in diversity and density, and the dominant life forms (from a functional feeding group perspective) were collectors, which depend on allochthonous organic matter; scrapers, which depend on autochthonous algal production, were scarce. We therefore suggest that diurnal or seasonal high waters transport products from marginal pools along dried riverbeds or from ponds on flood plains, and may serve as the source of organic matter in glacier-fed rivers.

In late June tremendous avalanches of snow, stones and slush make accurate measurements impossible, but afterwards drift could be estimated with nets, and benthic samples were gathered with scoops. Published data on erosion of similar streams were used to estimate the quantity of organic matter carried into the lake during the spring spate. About 600 kg of organic matter passes down stream from the watershed. The passage of organic matter during the brief season of free water provides the chief source of food for the limited benthic fauna, dominated by Chironomidae.sbd.Diamesa and Orthocladinae.sbd. and Enchytraeidae. The flora is dominated by diatoms. The biomass of the fauna of those parts of the stream investigated amounted to 2.54 g/m2.

A multibasin comparison of historical water quality trends in Lake Manitou, Ontario, a provincially significant lake trout lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Nelligan C, Jeziorski A, Ruhland KM, Paterson AM, Meyer-Jacob C, Smol JP. A multibasin comparison of historical water quality trends in Lake Manitou, Ontario, a provincially significant lake trout lake. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Lake Manitou, on Manitoulin Island (Ontario, Canada), is a two-basin lake that supports a natural lake trout population and currently experiences late-summer hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations below the provincial criterion set to support this sensitive coldwater fish species. However, limited direct monitoring data make it difficult to assess long-term changes in hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, and to identify what stressors may be responsible for those changes. Dated sediment cores from each basin of Lake Manitou were used to reconstruct end-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO) over the past similar to 150 years using assemblages of sedimentary chironomid remains. To assess the influence of nutrients, regional warming, and lake browning, VWHO reconstructions were compared with sedimentary diatom assemblage changes, and spectrally derived trends in both sedimentary chlorophyll a (and its main diagenetic products) and sediment-inferred lakewater total organic carbon. The chironomid-inferred VWHO reconstructions suggest that deepwater oxygen concentrations are currently lower in both basins of Lake Manitou than they were prior to the 20th century (decreasing in the late 1880s coincident with the development of Manitoulin Island by European settlers). In both basins, post-1950 diatom assemblage shifts and whole-lake primary production (sedimentary chlorophyll a) trends suggest that increased nutrient inputs and warming-related changes (i.e., enhanced thermal stability) may be contributing to the current low-oxygen conditions of Lake Manitou. In the west basin, all paleolimnological proxies underwent more pronounced (and often earlier) changes than in the east basin, an observation that suggests more targeted management strategies may be needed to protect Lake Manitou's coldwater fish population.					; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/B-8248-2014; Jeziorski, Adam/AAJ-6982-2020; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Jeziorski, Adam/0000-0001-7701-7247; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/0000-0002-8208-496X; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 2	2020	36	3			SI		243	259		10.1080/10402381.2019.1659889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1659889		OCT 2019											WOS:000492328500001

Continuous fluid circulation in Hammam Faraun geothermal system, Gulf of Suez rift, Egypt: evidences from hydrothermal deposits along rift-related faults	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Geothermal activities are often associated with hydrothermal deposits and hydrothermal features that could aid in geothermal exploration. As a case study, this paper is concerned mainly with the factors controlling the hydrothermal activities and deposits in the Hammam Faraun (HF) area, Gulf of Suez rift, Egypt. In addition to dolomites, hot spring travertine deposits recorded for the first time in this area are emphasized. The proposed conceptual models illustrated that these deposits are confined to the damage zone of the Hammam Faraun fault (HFF). The main factors controlling the hydrothermal activities through time are: syn-rift volcanic activities related to shallow magma chamber bounded to the lithosphere, variable fluid conditions and nature of hydrothermal circulation through HF fault system. At rift initiation, sea water percolated along the CLB fault (a clysmic fault parallel to HFF), reached the Nubian Sandstone and Eocene Carbonate aquifers, mixed with their water, heated and arose along the HFF. The hydrothermal deposits related to fluid circulation at this time are represented by stratabound dolomite. At rift climax, the massive dolostone was formed from coastal lakes mixed water. These dolomitizing lakes occupied the topographically low area at the flank of HF relay ramp. With the beginning of post rifting time, travertine deposits were developed from fluids inside spring lakes during the Pleistocene pluvial period. This sequential development of dolomitization, travertine, and hot fluid flow in HF area would suggest continuity of geothermal activities since the rift initiation until present.

The fluctuation of nutrients and organic carbon in the waters of some rivers in the Western Greece	Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol B, Poster Presentations	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				8th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 08-10, 2003	Lemnos Isl, GREECE	Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies, Global NEST				In this paper are presented preliminary results of a monitoring project for the water quality of three important rivers of the western Greece (Acheloos, Louros and Acherontas). The results include the concentrations as well as the temporal and spatial distributions of nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, ammonia, silicates and total organic carbon for a five month period (October 2002 to February 2003). Monthly samplings occurred in four sampling sites at Acheloos and Louros rivers and two at Acherontas river. The samples were analyzed by standard spectrophotmetrical methods. All samples were preserved by adding few drops of HgCl2 and storing in 4 C-0 until the chemical analysis. According to our measurements, Louros is the most polluted river as it concerns nitrogen compounds, probably due to the increased human activities in its catchment area. It also accepts temporary pollutants from the small stream of Vossa. Although Acheloos is the biggest and most important river for the whole territory, seems to be the less polluted. The chemical parameters level, indicate the enrichment of its water in nutrients, from the water of Lisimahia lake that enters Acheloos through the Water Lock of Dimikos. Not significant inflow of pollutants was observed in Acherontas river, as no remarkable spatial variation recorded. The concentration of silicates increased during autumn with a maximum in December. This behavior is probably due to the soil corrosion by the turbulent flow of the water during this season.

From 1972 to 1985, annual mortality and survivorship of adult females had been estimated at 1 and 96.6%, respectively, and only six dead turtles were found. Lake Sasajewun's population of C. serpentina was estimated in 1978-1979 and 1984-1985 at 38 and 47 adults, respectively. From 1976 to 1987, total number of nests found in the study area remained fairly constant and there were no significant changes in mean clutch size, mean clutch mass, or mean egg mass. On the main nest site, recruitment from 1976 to 1987 was 1.15 (1.8%) new females per year. From 1987 to 1989, we found 34 dead adult snapping turtles in the Wildlife Research Area. Observations of freshly dead animals indicated that most were killed by otters (Lutra canadensis) during the turtles' winter hibernation. A few uninjured turtles also died of septicemia in early spring shortly after emerging from hibernation. The estimated number of adults in Lake Sasajewun was 31 in 1988-1989, and the minimum number of adult residents known to be alive in the lake dropped from 47 in 1986 to 16 in 1989. In 1986 and 1987, annual adult female survivorship was estimated at 80 and 55%, respectively, and estimated numbers of nesting females declined from 82 in 1986 to 71 and 55 in 1987 and 1988, respectively. The actual number of nests found declined by 38 and 20% over the same periods. Although no significant differences occurred in mean egg mass or mean clutch size between 1987 and 1989 and earlier years, the mean clutch mass in 1988 was larger than in 1977 or 1978. This difference appeared to be due to a gradual increase in the mean age and body size of breeding females rather than to density-dependent changes. Recruitment into the adult breeding female population in 1987-1989 remained less than two individuals per year. Hatchling survival and number of juveniles were low throughout the study. Our observations support the view that populations of species with high, stochastic juvenile mortality and long adult life spans may be decimated quickly by increased mortality of adult animals, particularly if numbers of juveniles and immigrants are low. Recovery of such populations should be very slow because of a lack of effective density-dependent response in reproduction and recruitment.

Neonicotinoid Insecticides in Surface Water, Groundwater, and Wastewater Across Land-Use Gradients and Potential Effects	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Neonicotinoid insecticides cause adverse effects on nontarget organisms, but more information about their occurrence in surface and groundwater is needed across a range of land uses. Sixty-five sites in Minnesota, USA, representing rivers, streams, lakes, groundwater, and treated wastewater, were monitored via collection of 157 water samples to determine variability in spatiotemporal neonicotinoid concentrations. The data were used to assess relations to land use, hydrogeologic condition, and potential effects on aquatic life. Total neonicotinoid concentrations were highest in agricultural watersheds (median = 12 ng/L), followed by urban (2.9 ng/L) and undeveloped watersheds (1.9 ng/L). Clothianidin was most frequently detected in agricultural areas (detection frequency = 100%) and imidacloprid most often in urban waters (detection frequency = 97%). The seasonal trend of neonicotinoid concentrations in rivers, streams, and lakes showed that their highest concentrations coincided with spring planting and elevated streamflow. Consistently low neonicotinoid concentrations were found in shallow groundwater in agricultural regions (<1.2-16 ng/L, median = 1.4 ng/L). Treated municipal wastewater had the highest concentrations across all hydrologic compartments (12-48 ng/L, median = 19 ng/L), but neonicotinoid loads from rivers and streams (median = 4100 mg/d) were greater than in treated wastewater (700 mg/d). No samples exceeded acute aquatic-life benchmarks for individual neonicotinoids, whereas 10% of samples exceeded a chronic benchmark for neonicotinoid mixtures. Although 62% of samples contained 2 or more neonicotinoids, the observed concentrations suggest there were low acute and potential chronic risks to aquatic life. This the first study of its size in Minnesota and is critical to better understanding the drivers of wide-scale environmental contamination by neonicotinoids where urban, agricultural, and undeveloped lands are present.

Seasonal changes in bacterial diversity in the Salton Sea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Salton Sea is a large, shallow, endorheic, polymictic, saline lake in Southern California sustained by runoff from local agricultural and municipal wastewater. As a closed-basin lake in an arid region with declining water supply, it is becoming increasingly saline. Due to its eutrophic status and episodic wind-driven mixing, basin-wide anoxia events are becoming more common during summer. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene clones obtained from the water column and sediments provided the first molecular assessment of bacterial community structure in the Salton Sea. Similar to other saline habitats, the water column community was dominated by Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, although there was significant seasonal variability in diversity, richness, and the specific genera recovered. Sediments showed high diversity and richness and were dominated by sequences from cultured and uncultured phyla typical of marine sediments, especially the Deltaproteobacteria. This study has provided baseline data about the bacterial communities found in this important California water body and may serve as important indicators of change as the lake becomes increasingly saline over time or as remediation efforts are enacted.

Mean stocking density ranged 10-40 fingerlings/ha. In the following 5-7 years, data were collected to estimate the growth and survival rates of the fish and to assess the total yield and profitability of the releases in each lake. Catch samples were obtained from co-operating local fishermen. Fishing statistics were obtained by mailed fishing questionnaires. Reference data on growth and survival were collected from the two parent populations, which belong to the most abundant in Finland. Large annual and between-lake variation was found in the growth and survival rates of the fish released. In most year-classes, the stocked fish were smaller than one-year-old pikeperch in the parent populations. In two lakes, subsequent growth rates were faster than in the parent populations. Similarities in year-class patterns in parent populations and annual survival patterns of stocked fish suggest that common factors contribute to the variation in both cases. Year-class indices for the parent populations were, however, not correlated with summer mean temperatures or with the mean size of one-year-old fish. The yield of the releases varied in different lakes from 0.1 to 34 kg per thousand fingerlings (mean 11.5 kg). In two lakes, the estimated economic output exceeded the direct costs of the releases. An onset of natural reproduction was recorded in two other lakes. In an attempt to explain the variable results, the quality of the stocking material, the limnological features of the lakes, as well as the differences in the fish communities and in the fisheries are considered.																			0003-455X						1996	33	3-4					553	567																WOS:A1996WB44500033

However, hydroclimatic conditions within the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) regions during this event remain uncertain. Here we report a multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core obtained from Dayeze Lake in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in monsoonal China, to elucidate the hydroclimatic variabilities over the past 4.2 ka. Core intervals (4.2-3.5, 1.1-0.6 cal ka BP) containing high levels of sand fraction, low-frequency magnetic susceptibility and zirconium, and low levels of organic matter and calcium oxide, reflect outburst floods from the Yellow River. This is supported by the widespread fluvial deposits and slackwater deposits preserved in archaeological sites and loess-paleosol profiles from the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. In contrast, various climate records, such as lake level, pollen, and tree ring data, from the marginal regions of the ASM reflect widespread droughts during the same time period. This finding highlights the significant spatial heterogeneity of hydroclimate within ASM regions associated with the 4.2 ka BP event, which may be related to migrations of the monsoonal rain belt and the West Pacific subtropical high, as well as frequent El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation events. Referring to archaeological data, we conclude that the decline and collapse of Chinese Neolithic cultures were related to a pattern of droughts in the marginal regions of the ASM and floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River.

J	Zohary, T; Robarts, RD				Zohary, T; Robarts, RD			Experimental study of microbial P limitation in the eastern Mediterranean	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In this study we experimentally tested the hypothesis that phosphorus was the primary nutrient limiting phytoplankton and bacterial growth in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and examined the spatial variability in P Limitation during winter. Complementary measurements were employed using water sampled during January 1995 from nine pelagic stations east of the Straits of Sicily. Ambient concentrations of inorganic P (P-i) in the upper 50 m of the water column in seven of the stations were 20-40 nM. The upper limit of bioavailable P ranged from 6 to 18 nM, suggesting severe P shortage. Orthophosphate turnover time ranged from 2 to 7 h in those P-i-depleted waters. In nutrient-enrichment bioassays using subsurface water from the Ionian and Levantine basins, P addition caused significant increases in bacterial activity, bacterial numbers, and chlorophyll a relative to unenriched controls. The addition of NH4+ + Fe + EDTA did not have these effects. In a similar bioassay using Cretan water, microbial growth was obtained even in the unenriched controls, suggesting that other factors (e.g. grazing, light) were influential. Higher ambient P-i concentrations were encountered in the Cretan Sea (90 nM) and in the core of the Rhodes gyre (210 nM), where our sampling coincided with a convective mixing event. In those stations, P sufficiency was indicated. We concluded that in the pelagic waters of the eastern Mediterranean in winter, P was the primary limiting nutrient when other factors (such as light or grazing) did not control microbial biomass or activity. In ultra-oligotrophic waters, a delicate and dynamic balance differentiates between times when the microbial populations are nutrient limited and times when growth becomes limited by other factors. We caution that the interpretation of data obtained using conventional methods that were developed and tested in more enriched systems may not be valid in ultra-oligotrophic systems.																			0024-3590					MAY	1998	43	3					387	395		10.4319/lo.1998.43.3.0387	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.3.0387													WOS:000074215500002

Based on 4 years of continuous eddy covariance (EC) data over Erhai Lake, the monsoon effect on water- atmosphere exchange processes is investigated by comparing the energy and CO2 flux patterns and their main drivers during pre-monsoon (March-April), monsoon (May-October) and post-monsoon (November-December) periods. The results show that the atmospheric properties display a large difference during the three different periods. There is a negative difference between water surface and air temperature (T) during the pre-monsoon period, while a positive T during the post-monsoon period. The diurnal sensible heat flux (H-S) is larger during the post-monsoon period, while the latent heat flux (LE) is larger during the monsoon period. The monthly average H-S and heat storage (Q) in the lake remain negative during the pre-monsoon period and the early monsoon period, and they become positive in the middle monsoon period, which indicates that the lake absorbs heat at first and releases it subsequently. LE plays a dominating role in the energy partitioning of the lake. The Bowen ratio is higher during the post-monsoon period. The uptake of CO2 flux is observed in the middle of the day during monsoon and post-monsoon periods. The Delta T is the main driver for H-S and the effect of Delta T is increased as timescales are extended from half-hourly to monthly. The wind speed has a weak effect on H-S but a strong effect on LE and CO2 fluxes Similar main drivers for H-S are found during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods, which is also found for CO2 flux, indicating a large impact of the monsoon on the heat and carbon exchange processes over Erhai Lake.

The studies were started on the second year of the reservoir's existence. The records showed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations gradually increasing up to 25... 30 mg/L. The largest DOC pool in the reservoir comes from the spring load input, supplemented by the excessive development of phytoplankton with cyanobacteria dominance. The DOC limited the range of the photic zone, eliminated the occurrence of aquatic plants, and was a significant carrier of nutrients, which were gradually released to water, bringing about the "humoeutrophication" of the reservoir.

J	HANSSON, S; LARSSON, U; JOHANSSON, S				HANSSON, S; LARSSON, U; JOHANSSON, S			SELECTIVE PREDATION BY HERRING AND MYSIDS, AND ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN A BALTIC SEA COASTAL AREA	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In lakes, fish and invertebrate predation are recognized as strong structuring forces on zooplankton communities. The object of this investigation was to study whether predation was a similar potential in a coastal area of the brackish Baltic Sea and if it could explain observed differences in zooplankton community structure between a reference area and an eutrophied area. Species composition and daily vertical migration of zooplankton and zooplanktivores, and the diets of the latter, were studied in July and August at two 30 m deep stations differing in primary productivity. The biomass of zooplankton > 35 .mu.m was dominated by copepods, but cladocerans and rotifers also occurred in significant numbers. The dominating zooplanktivores were herring (Clupea harengus) and the mysid shrimp Mysis mixta. They fed almost exclusively on zooplankton, mainly copepods, and their estimated food consumption equalled or exceeded the summer copepodite production. The structure of the zooplankton community cannot be explained by effects of predation or by feeding conditions alone. Increases in rotifer and cladoceran abundances with increased primary production suggests effects of food supply. However, a generally rapid decline in the annual summer peak of cladocerans may be caused by predation. The total abundance of copepods did not increase with improved feeding conditions, but there was a shift in species dominance. The copepod Eurytemora affinis hirundoides, which was intensively preyed upon, increased with increased phytoplankton production, while Acartia bifilosa and/or A. longiremis, which was less eaten, decreased. Predation may explain a pronounced daily vertical migration of the most predated copepods. They occurred in deeper water during the day, when the visually feeding herring were active, and moved closer to the surface at night when M. mixta left the botton, to forage in the water column.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	1990	12	5					1099	1116		10.1093/plankt/12.5.1099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/12.5.1099													WOS:A1990DX49500014

Angling effort, particularly during the open-water season. was highest and often exceeded estimated Sustainable levels on lakes with good road access. Approximately 25% of the remote lakes also received excessive pressure during the winter season. Angler numerical responses to lake trout abundance were detected in remote lakes. but 1101 in road-accessible lakes. Smallmouth bass were more prevalent in lakes with road access and human settlement (either cottages or lodges), supporting the theory that they were introduced into these lakes. Lake trout populations were depleted throughout much of the Study range. Even without road access or smallmouth bass, lake trout abundance was still 47% lower than in unexploited reference lakes. When bass and (or) road access were present, lake trout abundance decreased by 77%. Remote lake trout populations in this area are clearly vulnerable to the negative impacts of improved access, a vector for both overexploitation and species introductions.					; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2009	66	2					212	223		10.1139/F08-205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F08-205													WOS:000264957500005

MODIS hyperspectral data, as calibrated to winged aircraft hyperspectral data, was used for ash tree characterization.

Fractal dimension analysis shows that FPAR time series data has a higher value as compared to the LAI time series data, consistent with the expectation of regulation in a biological system. A quadratic relationship was observed that suggests LAI/FPAR is proportional to FPAR, when FPAR is assumed to be indicative of the forcing parameter that represents chlorophyll content. The summer LAI/FPAR shows a 20% reduction in 2006, consistent with ground-based emerald ash borer infestation data. Such reduction of summer LAI/FPAR values has not been observed in the healthy Mary Jane Thurston State Park, Ohio, area. It is proposed that this LAI/FPAR model may be used to help delineate the spread of the emerald ash borer.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9230-2				2012	8513								851304	10.1117/12.929786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.929786													WOS:000312366600002

However, nine specimens were discovered in March and April 2010 in Lake Saiko, Yamanashi Prefecture, one of the lakes to which eyed eggs of the species were introduced in 1935. These were identified as O. kawamurae because of having 47-62 pyloric caeca, 37-43 gill-rakers, a black-colored body, and spawning at 30-40 m depth in early spring, which are unique characteristics within Oncorhynchus. Furthermore, the distinctiveness of Kunimasu from sympatric kokanee (O. nerka) was supported by microsatellite DNA data.

The concentrations of the pharmaceutical residues in the shallow, young bank filtrate (travel times < one month) were correlated to the prevailing hydrochemical conditions at the field site. In addition, their behaviour during passage through an undisturbed sediment core from the lake base at the site (clogging layer) was evaluated in the laboratory. Phenazone, 4-acetylaminoantipyrine (AAA), 4-formylaminoantipyrin (FAA) and 1,5-dimethyl-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (DP) were eliminated more efficiently under oxic conditions, while 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyloxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH) was not eliminated at all. The redox conditions and the elimination of the respective pharmaceutical residues displayed strong seasonal variations. Oxic conditions were only encountered close to the shore in winter, when temperatures were low. The column study showed that the elimination is restricted to the uppermost decimetres of the lake base, where oxygen is present. While phenazone elimination is almost complete during aerobic rapid sand filtration in the waterworks, the compounds were found to be more persistent under anoxic field conditions.

C.; Couture, Patrice			Condition and pyloric caeca as indicators of food web effects in fish living in metal-contaminated lakes	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Variations in fish condition, pyloric caeca (PC) mass and tissue metal concentrations were examined in two consecutive summers in yellow perch collected along two polymetallic gradients in Canada, Sudbury (ON) and Rouyn-Noranda (QC). The potential of PC mass variations to help interpret food web-mediated changes in condition was also evaluated. The lack of relationships between PC weight and condition, even in reference lakes, indicated that factors other than feeding rate influenced fish condition. Inter-annual variations in fish condition (12-58%), PC weight (14-20%) and tissue metal concentrations (30-550%) were often of greater magnitude than differences between reference and contaminated fish sampled in the same year. The apparent lack of correspondence between feeding rate and condition and the large inter-annual variation in examined metrics highlight the need to better understand the ecological underpinnings that influence metal toxicity in field situations.

Climate Change: A bibliometric study of the Great Lakes Basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Great Lakes region of North America is experiencing climate-driven disturbances that threaten the safety and livelihoods of coastal communities and people. Limitations to the spatial and temporal coverage of research have the potential to hamper the ability to predict site-specific conditions and responses to climatic events. In this paper, we contextualize these spatial and temporal limitations of climate change research. Our summary reveals an uneven spatial distribution of research across the basin and publication outlets, with research focused on Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron, and the increasing availability of biological and ecological data to forecast future conditions. The spatial and temporal limitations related to historical data, region-wide monitoring efforts, research during the winter season, and the technological and methodological developments in natural resource management that can overcome these limitations are explored. Future research and emerging data needs are discussed, including the need for increased inclusion of the social sciences and improving relationships with Indigenous and First Nation communities in terms of research, data sharing, and governance.					; Fergen, Joshua/AAW-3081-2021; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Fergen, Joshua/0000-0003-1359-9561; 													0380-1330					JUN	2024	50	3							102316	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102316		MAY 2024											WOS:001242659800001

Pollen in the water was sampled throughout the year near the river-mouth, and at the outflow and inflow of one lake within the watershed. The phenology of pollen of trees, grasses, Ambrosia and aquatic plants was studied and compared to the patterns found in aerial samplers; re-suspension phases and peaks were similar in both transporting media.

The efficiency of three fry trawls for sampling the freshwater pelagic fry community	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Avoidance reactions of young-of-the-year fish assemblages were investigated in the offshore zone of three reservoirs in the Czech Republic during late summer. Pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca) strongly dominated in the Lipno Reservoir in 2003, bream (Abramis brama) and bleak (Alburnus alburnus) were the most abundant species in the Slapy Reservoir in 2004 and roach (Rutilus rutilus) and bleak dominated in the Zelivka Reservoir in 2004 and 2005. Densities of fry ranged between 1.09 ind./100 m(3) in the Lipno Reservoir and 2.95 ind./100 m(3) in the Slapy Reservoir. In each reservoir, three trawl nets of different widths (dimensions .1.5 m x 3 m, 3 m x 3 m, 6 m x 3 m) were used in the pelagic area at night. For each trawl the estimated fish density was determined as the catch per 100 m(3) of water and was compared between all three trawls. The fish length-frequency distribution was also compared between all the trawls. Day catches were much lower compared with those taken at night. Adult fish showed very clear avoidance of fry trawls. At night, no important differences in estimated fry density, obtained by these trawls, were observed in any locality for any fish species, nor in the length distribution of important species between trawls. According to these results, the avoidance reactions of fry in the late summer (August, September), at night, are unimportant. At this time of year, nighttime pelagic trawling appears to be an effective method for quantitative fry sampling. We recommend the 3 m x 3 m trawl for quantitative night sampling of the fry community as a good compromise between assured efficiency and relatively easy handling. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Occasional decreases in productivity appear related to weather conditions encountered during spring migration and upon arrival at Besnard Lake. Studies of four marked birds suggest considerable nest site fidelity. Observations of marked eagles in combination with surveys of Bald Eagles on Besnard and other local lakes provide insight into age structure for the local population and into adult mortality rates. We estimate adult mortality in this stable population to be 6.5-7.7%. Population stability appears to be maintained as a result of the eagles' deferring first breeding to age six.																			0892-1016					SEP	1992	26	3					159	166																WOS:A1992JU53900007

Temperature Drives Epidemics in a Zooplankton-Fungus Disease System: A Trait-Driven Approach Points to Transmission via Host Foraging	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Climatic warming will likely have idiosyncratic impacts on infectious diseases, causing some to increase while others decrease or shift geographically. A mechanistic framework could better predict these different temperature-disease outcomes. However, such a framework remains challenging to develop, due to the nonlinear and (sometimes) opposing thermal responses of different host and parasite traits and due to the difficulty of validating model predictions with observations and experiments. We address these challenges in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) system. We test the hypothesis that warmer temperatures promote disease spread and produce larger epidemics. In lakes, epidemics that start earlier and warmer in autumn grow much larger. In a mesocosm experiment, warmer temperatures produced larger epidemics. A mechanistic model parameterized with trait assays revealed that this pattern arose primarily from the temperature dependence of transmission rate (), governed by the increasing foraging (and, hence, parasite exposure) rate of hosts (f). In the trait assays, parasite production seemed sufficiently responsive to shape epidemics as well; however, this trait proved too thermally insensitive in the mesocosm experiment and lake survey to matter much. Thus, in warmer environments, increased foraging of hosts raised transmission rate, yielding bigger epidemics through a potentially general, exposure-based mechanism for ectotherms. This mechanistic approach highlights how a trait-based framework will enhance predictive insight into responses of infectious disease to a warmer world.					; Civitello, David/A-5422-2010; Duffy, Meghan/AFN-5376-2022; Shocket, Marta/ACV-5058-2022	Shocket, Marta/0000-0002-8995-4446; Strauss, Alexander/0000-0003-0633-8443													0003-0147	1537-5323				APR	2018	191	4					435	451		10.1086/696096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/696096								29570399					WOS:000428287200004

The object was to define and compare the daily pattern of activity of the 3 species as indicated by the numbers caught hourly on 3 black cattle that were used as bait. Catching during the hours of darkness was done by the light of dimmed hurricane lamps. The period of observation covered successively a dry season, a wet season, a cool dry season and a hot dry season. At all seasons, males of G. pallidipes were caught in gradually increasing numbers from just before dawn until shortly before sunset, after which a rapid decrease took place. Females of G . pallidipes exhibited a different pattern, with a gradual rise in activity in the morning until about midday, after which activity remained more or less constant until shortly before sunset, when a rapid fall occurred. There was never any indication of a morning peak in activity such as has been described for this species elsewhere. A ctivity during the night was at an extremely low level. A ctivity of both males and females of G. p. fuscipes started about dawn, increased to a peak in the middle hours of the day, and then fell fairly rapidly in the evening; the exact time of the peak was variable. None was caught during the night. There was some activity of G. brevipalpis throughout the diel, but marked peaks of activity were exhibited by both sexes. In the open, these took place immediately after sunset and immediately before sunrise, the latter being the smaller. In the shade, the morning peak in both sexes was an hour later than in the open, and the evening peak in males alone was an hour earlier. These results are compared with those of other workers, and the influence of physical factors is discussed. Particular values of temperature and saturation deficit were not closely associated with particular levels of activity of any of the 3 species, and light intensity is probably the physical factor that is most consistently the same at times of particular levels of activity at all seasons.																			0007-4853	1475-2670					1965	56		1				141	+		10.1017/S0007485300057102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300057102													WOS:A19657266600012

However, continuous dated evidence of regional environmental changes is a rarity, but are very important for comparison with global climate events on a millennial scale. We presented a millennial-scale reconstruction of vegetation changes in the southern part of the Russian Far East during the Last Interglacial, Last Glaciation, and Holocene. The reconstruction is based on analyses of the pollen record from deep-sea sediment core from the Sea of Japan (SJ) and then it was corresponded with the previously constructed by Gorbarenko team age model. We compared vegetation changes with published data on productivity changes and sedimentation in the SJ and with the variability of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) over the last 120 kyr to determine the dynamics of climate relationships between land and sea on the millennial scale. The oak and other thermophilic species dominated in the region during the strongest Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) interstadials (DOIs) 24, 23, 18, 17, 14 and 8, indicating warm and wet climate conditions because of rapid climate changes and high activity of EASM. Simultaneously, the surface water primary productivity increased, contributing to the dark layer formation on the bottom. The shrubby alder and cold-hardy birch species spread in the adjacent land during the cold Heinrich stadials (HS) and Dansgaard-Oeschger stadials (DOS) in response to cold conditions because of global climate changes and weak intensity of EASM. The primary productivity mostly decreased in response to climate cooling, favorable to light layers formation in the JS.

A risk assessment of the golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) for Ontario, Canada	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS					2nd Freshwater Invasives - Networking for Strategy II (FINS-II) Conference	JUL 11-14, 2016	Zagreb, CROATIA	Univ Zagreb, European Inland Fisheries & Aquaculture Advisory Commiss				The golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, is an epibenthic mytilid native to freshwaters of China and south-eastern Asia. It became established in Hong Kong in 1965, in Japan in the 1990's and South America in 1991 through ballast water discharge into the La Plata River basin in Argentina. It has since expanded to Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil in South America. Populations have steadily increased in these countries since their first reported incidence. The golden mussel is not yet present in North America. A Risk Assessment of golden mussel for the Province of Ontario, Canada was performed using a four step process, developed by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry: While the potential impacts of an invasion of golden mussel in the Great Lakes has been well documented, the likelihood of a wide spread invasion (i.e., the likelihood of arrival, survival, establishment and spread) was further investigated. Uncertainty for each of the four stages of invasion was also estimated. The risk assessment ranked ballast water exchange of Atlantic transoceanic vessels from South America as the primary potential pathway for introduction of golden mussel directly into the Great Lakes. A "back door" entry into the Great Lakes was also considered via overland dispersal (e.g. trailered boats) following a ballast water exchange introduction by transoceanic vessels from Asia to the Pacific coast of North America. However, the overall probability of arrival through these two pathways was ranked low. The probability of survival, establishment, and spread of golden mussel in Ontario was deemed to be low, primarily because of its physiological intolerance of cold, winter waters. The level of uncertainty was considered moderate as there has been no golden mussel invasion reported from lakes that freeze over in Asia or South America for at least two months. Based on the current distribution of golden mussel being limited mostly to waters with minimum temperatures of 10 degrees C to 12 degrees C at 36 degrees latitude, the Climatch analysis, and the number of degree days required for reproduction and establishment, the level of risk for invasion into Ontario waters is low and the level of uncertainty is moderate. This would likely apply to all of Canada and most of the USA north of the 36th parallel that is covered by snow or where lakes have ice cover for at least two months of the year. An analysis of the impact of climate change on golden mussel in Ontario suggests that summer temperatures in Lake Erie could rise to levels that would support reproduction and establishment by 2040. However, the lowest temperature reported to support establishment of mussels is 5 degrees C and it is estimated it would likely take more than 200 years to reach and maintain this temperature in Lake Erie.																			1989-8649					SEP	2017	8	3			SI		383	402		10.3391/mbi.2017.8.3.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2017.8.3.12													WOS:000412582000012

The study was carried out at Lake Pavin during the spring planktonic bloom. Photosynthetic and photo- and chemohcterotrophic activities were measured from the assimilation of (NaHCO3)-C-14 and glucose-H-3, using a double labeling technique. The bacterial community was at low cell concentration (0.6 to 7 X 10(5) cells ml-1) and represented very low biomass values (0.9 to 11.5 mugC liter-1). The abundance of the phytoplankton varied between 0.5 and 1.8 X 10(6) cells liter-1, and biomass values ranged between 19 and 118 mugC liter-1. The diatom Melosira italica sp. subarctica (O. Mueller) was the largely dominant species in the meta- and hypolimnion. Inorganic fixation by photolithotrophy (mean value: 1.66 mg C m-3 hour-1) largely predominates over assimilation by photoheterotrophy (mean value: 0.93 mug C m-3 hour-1) or chemoheterotrophy (mean value: 2.42 mug C m-3 hour-1). However, because of the considerable underestimation of heterotrophic assimilation due to the experimental methods used, and because of the spatial and temporal separation of photolithotrophic and photo- and chemoheterotrophic activities, it is likely that the fixation of organic carbon by microalgae plays an important role in the survival of species and/or in competitive interactions, as the results with Monoraphidium contortum (Pasch. et Korschik.), the prevailing species in the epilimnion, would suggest.																			0095-3628						1992	24	2					109	123											24193131					WOS:A1992JY30200001

Influence of Environmental Factors on the Production of MIB and Geosmin Metabolites by Bacteria in a Eutrophic Reservoir	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Occurrences of odorous bacterial metabolites, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin (GSM), in drinking water supply reservoirs are considered as a nuisance by the water industry and a source of complaints from customers. In Eagle Creek Reservoir, routine monitoring programs of MIB and GSM highlight intense odorous outbreaks during the spring season when high inflow discharges occur. Cyanobacteria have always been assumed to be source of these metabolites even if no known producers are present in raw water. A copper-based algaecide is often used to terminate the metabolite production and the algal growth in the reservoir. The current study was designed to investigate and identify other biological sources involved in the biosynthesis of MIB and GSM metabolites as well as environmental factors that could be important triggers for the growth of bacterial producers. The community structure of the bacterioplankton was determined using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing technique, which showed that not only Cyanobacteria but Actinobacteria also were involved in the reservoir internal production. Planktothrix species was identified as the main source of GSM (p < 0.001) while Streptomyces (Actinobacteria) was very likely responsible of MIB (p < 0.01). Application of an algaecide disrupted GSM and the growth of Planktothrix but was less effective against MIB and Streptomyces. Statistical analyses revealed that MIB- and GSM-causing bacteria were found abundant when the water was enriched with nitrogen, temperature cooler, and the water column mixed.

We tested the hypothesis that the choice of a particular life-history tactic may be controlled by a conditional strategy with status-dependent selection. This prediction was not supported because migratory patterns did not vary as a function of individual size, age and/or sex of eels prior to migration. However, we demonstrated that the utilisation of the estuarine brackish environment, more productive than the freshwater river and lake, resulted in a higher growth rate. Freshwater yellow eels, the typical catadromous tactic, were rare and experienced lower growth rates. Moreover, we suggest that freshwater overwintering periods are not recorded in otoliths owing to the cold winter climate that occurs at northern latitudes. Thus, Sr:Ca ratio patterns that show brackish residence may in some cases hide a seasonal migration between fresh and brackish habitats.

J	Roman, M; Zhang, X; McGilliard, C; Boicourt, W				Roman, M; Zhang, X; McGilliard, C; Boicourt, W			Seasonal and annual variability in the spatial patterns of plankton biomass in Chesapeake Bay	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We conducted high-resolution, underway sampling in April, July, and October for 6 yr (1995-2000) in the large estuary, Chesapeake Bay. This period included climatological extremes in freshwater inputs that strongly influenced both the overall stocks and spatial distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Higher biomass of both phytoplankton and zooplankton occurred in springs, when freshwater input into Chesapeake Bay was above the average discharge. While whole-Bay productivity appears to be influenced by freshwater flow variability, mesoscale patterns in plankton biomass are driven by freshwater inputs, circulation, and bathymetry. Persistent maxima in plankton biomass occurred in areas of physical and topographic discontinuities such as the upper-Bay salt front, plume fronts, the hydraulic control region, tidal fronts, and near a topographically induced eddy. Although the contribution of these hot spots to the whole-Bay standing stock of plankton may vary due to changes in the background levels of plankton, controlled in part by freshwater discharge, they nevertheless represent predictable areas of higher forage for planktivorous fish. Enhanced trophic coupling between plankton and fish at these physical discontinuities may be one reason why estuaries have higher fisheries yields in relation to their primary production than lakes and other marine systems.					; Roman, Michael/F-9390-2013	McGilliard, Carey/0000-0001-5708-8283; 													0024-3590					MAR	2005	50	2					480	492		10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0480	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0480													WOS:000227835200009

Other turtle species recorded using alligator nests were Apalone ferox; Kinosfernon sp, and Sternotherus odoratus. In the seven wetlands, 26.6% of 1586 occupied (i.e, active) alligator nests contained I? nelsoni eggs. Of the four lakes sampled for 6 yr, Lake Okeechobee had the highest incidence of use of occupied nests by nesting I! nelsoni and the most turtle clutches per occupied nest Nesting P. nelsoni used occupied nests more frequently in Lake Apopka than in Lake Jesup Nesting P. nelsoni used vacant alligator nests (63.6%) more often than occupied nests (36.1%) at Lake Okeechobee, which suggests that attending female alligators may deter nesting turtles. Annual incidence of nest use by nesting turtles was correlated positively with June-July mean water levels in lakes Okeechobee and Jesup, where emergent marsh was the principal habitat and alternative nest sites were probably limited during high-water conditions. In the four lakes combined, turtles did not preferentially select alligator nests in a particular habitat type. Use of 1330 occupied nests by turtles in the four lakes was significantly lower in 1990 (13.5%) than in other years (21.9%-29.3%). We hypothesize that observed differences among lakes in turtle use of alligator nests resulted from differences in (1) water-level fluctuations, (2) availability of alternative nesting sites (i.e, distance to upland habitat), and (3) turtle population sizes.

Stages in the infection process were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy and evidence was obtained that the Lagenidium-like fungus concerned was a virulent parasite. Fungal destruction of eggs varied in timing and severity from year to year. The maximum impact of the disease was an estimated 48.4% decrease in potential copepod recruitment in 1976 due to the onset of a severe epidemic early in the summer growing season. The minimum impact, a 5.6% decrease in potential recruitment, was recorded in 1975. In this year the proportion of infected eggs was reduced and large numbers of juveniles were released before the fungal disease began. The 1974 epidemic was intermediate in severity. The effect of these epidemics on Castle Lake calanoid populations is discussed in relation to temperature, food availability and predation.

The current and previous states of the MJO are utilized as predictors, based on the Real-time Multivariate (RMM) indices of Wheeler and Hendon. Beyond the persistence-driven first pentad, potentially useful skill is mainly observed during strong MJO events in phases 3, 4, 7, and 8, which correspond to a dipole diabatic heating anomaly in the tropical Indian Ocean and western Pacific.

Increasing phytoplankton bacterivory along a gradient of lake warming and browning	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Eukaryotic phytoplankton form the basis of aquatic food webs and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Many of these evolutionarily diverse microalgae are also capable of feeding on other microbes, and hence simultaneously act both as primary producers and consumers. The net ecosystem impact of such mixotrophs depends on their nutritional strategy which is likely to alter with environmental change. Many temperate lakes are currently warming at unprecedented rates and are simultaneously increasing in water color (browning) due to increased run-off of humic substances. We hypothesized that the resulting reduction in light intensity and increased bacterial abundances would favor mixotrophic phytoplankton over obligate autotrophs, while higher temperatures might boost their rates of bacterivory. We tested these hypotheses in a mesocosm experiment simulating a gradient of increasing temperature and water color in temperate shallow lakes as expected to occur over the coming century. Mixotrophs showed a faster increase in abundance under the climate change scenario during spring, when they dominated the phytoplankton community. Furthermore, both bacterial abundances and rates of phytoplankton bacterivory increased under future climate conditions. Bacterivory contributed significantly to phytoplankton resource acquisition under future climate conditions, while remaining negligible throughout most of the season in treatments resembling today's conditions. Hence, to our knowledge, we here provide the first evidence for an increasing importance of bacterivory by phytoplankton in future temperate shallow lakes. Such a change in phytoplankton nutritional strategies will likely impact biogeochemical cycles and highlights the need to conceptually integrate mixotrophy into current ecosystem models.

Shallow groundwater systems in a polar desert, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica, exist in a hyperarid polar desert, underlain by deep permafrost. With an annual mean air temperature of -18 A degrees C, the MDVs receive < 10 cm snow-water equivalent each year, collecting in leeward patches across the landscape. The landscape is dominated by expansive ice-free areas of exposed soils, mountain glaciers, permanently ice-covered lakes, and stream channels. An active layer of seasonally thawed soil and sediment extends to less than 1 m from the surface. Despite the cold and low precipitation, liquid water is generated on glaciers and in snow patches during the austral summer, infiltrating the active layer. Across the MDVs, groundwater is generally confined to shallow depths and often in unsaturated conditions. The current understanding and the biogeochemical/ecological significance of four types of shallow groundwater features in the MDVs are reviewed: local soil-moisture patches that result from snow-patch melt, water tracks, wetted margins of streams and lakes, and hyporheic zones of streams. In general, each of these features enhances the movement of solutes across the landscape and generates soil conditions suitable for microbial and invertebrate communities.					; Barrett, John/D-5851-2016; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015	Levy, Joseph/0000-0002-6222-139X; Barrett, John/0000-0002-7610-0505; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315													1431-2174	1435-0157				FEB	2013	21	1					171	183		10.1007/s10040-012-0926-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-012-0926-3													WOS:000314333600013
J	MACOMBER, SA; WOODCOCK, CE				MACOMBER, SA; WOODCOCK, CE			MAPPING AND MONITORING CONIFER MORTALITY USING REMOTE-SENSING IN THE LAKE TAHOE BASIN	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A prolonged drought in the western United States has resulted in alarming levels of mortality in conifer forests. Satellite remote sensing holds the potential for mapping and monitoring the effects of such environmental changes over large geographic areas in a timely manner. Results from the application of a forest canopy reflectance model using multitemporal Landsat TM imagery and field measurements, indicate conifer mortality can be effectively mapped and inventoried. The test area for this project is the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit in the Sierra Nevada of California. The Landsat TM images are from the summers of 1988 and 1991. The Li-Strahler canopy model estimates several forest stand parameters, including tree size and canopy cover for each conifer stand, from reflectance values in satellite imagery. The difference in cover estimates between the dates forms the basis for stratifying stands into mortality classes, which are used as both themes in a map and the basis of the field sampling design. Field measurements from 61 stands collected in the summer of 1992 indicate 15% of the original timber volume in the true fir zone died between 1988 and 1992. The resulting low standard error of 11% for this estimate indicates the utility of these mortality classes for detecting areas of high mortality. Also, the patterns in the estimated mean timber volume loss for each class follow the expected trends. The results of this project are immediately useful for fire hazard management, by providing both estimates of the degree of overall mortality and maps showing its location. They also indicate current remote sensing technology may be useful for monitoring the changes in vegetation that are expected to result from climate change.

Similar pairs of lakes with differing infestations of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, and starry stonewort, Nitellopsis obtuse, were used as study sites to infer how being at an infested lake vs. being at an uninfested lake and different local species would impact responses. We also examined recreationists' visit motivation, and aquatic invasive species perceived risk, knowledge, and awareness of problem. We estimated mean willingness to pay about nine to ten dollars per day, which did not differ significantly by lake. Additionally, perceived risk, awareness of problem, and visit motivation were significant in predicting willingness to pay, which could have important ramifications for aquatic invasive species management.

However, due to different interpretations of the proxies and records, the pattern of Holocene precipitation/moisture variations in the region remains unclear. A lake-sediment-based reconstruction of runoff variations, which can directly and sensitively reflect changes in precipitation, provides the opportunity to reconstruct the evolution of moisture conditions in the SE Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. In this study, we used a well-dated sediment core (LGH2) from Lake Lugu, a deep alpine lake charged mainly by precipitation on the lake surface and by runoff from the watershed, to reconstruct variations in runoff during the Holocene. In addition, 70 lake surface sediment samples were collected to examine the spatial variation of grain size. Endmember modeling analysis of the grain-size data was used to characterize the processes of sediment transport and runoff fluctuations. The carbonate content of core LGH2 shows that the lake level was generally high during 11,600-3100 cal years BP, and that the lake basin was closed after 3100 cal years BP and semi-closed since 90 cal years BP. Grain-size endmember EM 3, which represents the runoff input clastic materials, is used to reconstruct runoff fluctuations in the Lake Lugu watershed. The record indicates a gradual increase in runoff during 11,600-9000 cal years BP, stable and high runoff during 9000-2000 cal years BP, and weak runoff and a low lake level since 2000 cal years BP. Our reconstruction of runoff fluctuations tracks changes in regional temperature and tropical SSTs rather than in boreal summer insolation. This finding supports the hypothesis that increasing tropical SSTs strengthened ITCZ convection which enhanced the flux of water vapour from the ocean to the air, and hence the moisture supplies to SW China.					zhang, xiaonan/D-8565-2015; Ashraf, Umar/ABB-7906-2021; Yunlong, Zhang/AAV-9041-2021; Yang, Yingying/GRS-1048-2022	zhang, xiaonan/0000-0001-6947-945X; Ashraf, Umar/0000-0003-2402-3605; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2021	31	3					346	355		10.1177/0959683620972777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620972777		NOV 2020											WOS:000637914400001

Stratification in a Reservoir Mixed by Bubble Plumes under Future Climate Scenarios	WATER												During summer, reservoir stratification can negatively impact source water quality. Mixing via bubble plumes (i.e., destratification) aims to minimise this. Within Blagdon Lake, a UK drinking water reservoir, a bubble plume system was found to be insufficient for maintaining homogeneity during a 2017 heatwave based on two in situ temperature chains. Air temperature will increase under future climate change which will affect stratification; this raises questions over the future applicability of these plumes. To evaluate bubble-plume performance now and in the future, AEM3D was used to simulate reservoir mixing. Calibration and validation were done on in situ measurements. The model performed well with a root mean squared error of 0.53 degrees C. Twelve future meteorological scenarios from the UK Climate Projection 2018 were taken and down-scaled to sub-daily values to simulate lake response to future summer periods. The down-scaling methods, based on diurnal patterns, showed mixed results. Future model runs covered five-year intervals from 2030 to 2080. Mixing events, mean water temperatures, and Schmidt stability were evaluated. Eight scenarios showed a significant increase in water temperature, with two of these scenarios showing significant decrease in mixing events. None showed a significant increase in energy requirements. Results suggest that future climate scenarios may not alter the stratification regime; however, the warmer water may favour growth conditions for certain species of cyanobacteria and accelerate sedimentary oxygen consumption. There is some evidence of the lake changing from polymictic to a more monomictic nature. The results demonstrate bubble plumes are unlikely to maintain water column homogeneity under future climates. Modelling artificial mixing systems under future climates is a powerful tool to inform system design and reservoir management including requirements to prevent future source water quality degradation.

So far, their overall role in regulating lake methane flux is a subject of debate because the oxygen produced by their roots can promote methane oxidation in the sediment but they can also enhance methanogenesis through organic substrate production. in this study, we used the eddy covariance method to investigate the temporal dynamics of the CH4 flux in a habitat of submerged macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The results show that the nighttime CH4 flux is on average 33% higher than the daytime flux, although a clear diurnal pattern is evident only in the spring. At the daily to the seasonal time scale, the sediment temperature is the main driver of the CH4 flux variations, implying higher methane production in the sediment at higher temperatures. The annual CH4 emission (6.12 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) is much higher than the published whole-lake mean flux (1.12 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and that reported previously in the eutrophic phytoplankton zone of the lake (1.35 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that the net effect of the submerged macrophytes is to enhance methane emission. At the annual time scale, 3.5% of the carbon gained by the net ecosystem production is lost to the atmosphere in the form of CH4. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yu, PS; Chen, MT				Yu, Pai-Sen; Chen, Min-Te			A prolonged warm and humid interval during marine isotope stage 13-15 as revealed by hydrographic reconstructions from the South China Sea (IMAGES MD972142)	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES					Annual Congress of Chinese-Geophysical-and-Geological-Society-of-Taiwan on Quaternary Paleoclimate of the Western Pacific and East Asia	MAY 06-07, 2009	Chiayi, TAIWAN	Chinese Geophys & Geolog Soc Taiwan				Variations of orbital-driven insolation, ice volume, and greenhouse gas effects have been proposed as major controlling factors in determining the timing and amplitude of Quaternary cyclic climate changes. However, it remains to be determined how the internal feedback in the tropical atmosphere and ocean and the coupling between the low- and high-latitude systems may have produced instability or non-cyclic changes in the long-term climate evolution. Such "abnormalities" have been reported increasingly from paleoclimatic reconstructions in East Asia and the western Pacific for a prolonged warm and humid climate interval during marine isotope stage (MIS) 13-15, similar to 475-610 kya. To better address the climate abnormality in MIS 13-15 that has been observed in the western Pacific, here we report high-resolution late Quaternary planktic foraminifer faunal abundance and faunal sea surface temperature (SST) records from the International Marine Past Global Change (IMAGES) program core MD972142, which was retrieved from the southeastern South China Sea (SCS). Our results indicate that the faunal assemblages and SSTs in the southeastern SCS express a substantially prolonged, unusual warm interglacial-type climate condition in MIS 13-15. The climate was abnormally warm during the cold MIS 14. Our study also suggests a lowering of sea surface salinity (SSS) during MIS 13-15. While the western Pacific climate experienced a persistently warm and humid period at MIS 14, a "normal" cooling (similar to 2 degrees C) condition on the surface of the eastern equatorial Pacific existed concomitantly. While assessing possible interpretations of this "abnormal" climate interval in MIS 13-15, our study indicates that an enhanced interhemispheric and/or longitudinal temperature gradient across the basin-wide Pacific cannot be ruled out. A change in the sensitivity of the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) that controlled temperature and precipitation patterns in East Asia and the western Pacific is probably also important or responsible for this climate abnormality. Based on our evidence, we suggest that the tropical dynamics would have played a role in the climate abnormality in MIS 13-15, through maintaining or even increasing the longitudinal SST gradient in the equatorial Pacific, which may have intensified the low-latitude trade winds in the eastern component of the Walker Circulation that drove a longer duration and/or stronger intensity of the summer vs. winter EAM.

The Tanganyika sardine, Limnothrissa miodon (Boulenger), thrives very well when the water is in circulation and when its food (zooplankton) is abundant due to increased nutrients in the water column. There is a fall in the sardine yields as the water column gets partitioned into a nutrient-poor epilimnion and a nutrient-rich hypolimnion during thermal stratification. A very high negative correlation (r2=0.94,n=32) was found between thermal stratification and the monthly yields of the sardines. This uneven annual distribution of sardine yields creates problems for the local fishery.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				FEB	1987	30	2					127	133		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1987.tb05739.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1987.tb05739.x													WOS:A1987G553600004

Since SVCV was isolated in Lake Ontario in 2007, concern has grown about its spread in the Great Lakes basin and its potential negative impacts on fish species of importance in stock enhancement programs basinwide. The susceptibility of representative fish species from the families Cyprinidae (Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas, Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas, Spotfin Shiner Cyprinella spiloptera, and Creek Chub Semotilus atromaculatus), Centrarchidae (Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides), Percidae (Walleye Sander vitreus), Salmonidae (Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss), and Esocidae (Muskellunge Esox masquinongy) to SVCV was evaluated by experimental infection under laboratory conditions. Morbidity and mortality were recorded, and virus re-isolation, seminested reverse transcription PCR, and histopathological assessments were performed. Using intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, Fathead Minnows and Golden Shiners were highly susceptible to SVCV (40-70% mortality). All dead or moribund and apparently healthy surviving Fathead Minnows and Golden Shiners were SVCV positive. The SVCV was also detected in challenged but healthy Spotfin Shiners (30%) and Creek Chub (5%). However, noncyprinid species exhibited no morbidity or mortality and were free of SVCV following an observation period of 30 d. In a follow-up experimental challenge, Fathead Minnows and Golden Shiners were SVCV challenged at 10(3) and 10(5) PFU/mL by means of waterborne immersion. After immersion, Fathead Minnows and Golden Shiners exhibited characteristic SVCV disease signs, but mortality was less (30% and 10% mortality, respectively) than that in fish with i.p. injections. The SVCV was detected in all mortalities and a subset of healthy Fathead Minnows and Golden Shiners. Necrotic changes were observed in the kidneys, liver, spleen, ovaries, and heart, and other histopathological lesions also occurred. These findings suggest that two of the four cyprinids tested are susceptible to SVCV-induced disease and that all four can act as potential carriers of SVCV in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

In this paper, we analyse a 7100 year summer flood record recovered from Lake Mondsee (NE Alps), using a statistical approach. We identify a point process of renewal type, with a significant change-point of the occurrence pattern around 350 CE, switching from the overlay of two mechanisms of event recurrences of 5 and 50 years before to 2 and 17 years after this change-point. This change-point approach enables a comparison to other flood records, and possibly to relate event frequencies to climatic conditions. We also highlight how lower temporal resolution of flood records can hamper the analysis of relations to climatic signals. Hence high-resolution records with robust chronologies and flood information (e.g. seasonality and event characteristics) are essential to improve the understanding of the interplay between climatic signals and flood occurrences, which is an important ingredient for proper risk estimation and risk management.

Climatic and environmental changes during the Weichselian Lateglacial Interstadial in the Weerterbos region, the Netherlands	BOREAS												van Asch, N., Heiri, O., Bohncke, S. J. P. & Hoek, W. Z. 2013 (January): Climatic and environmental changes during the Weichselian Lateglacial Interstadial in the Weerterbos region, the Netherlands. Boreas, Vol. 42, pp. 123-139. 10.1111/j.1502-3885.2012.00281.x. ISSN 0300-9483. Lake sediment records from the Weerterbos region, in the southern Netherlands, were studied to reconstruct summer temperature and environmental changes during the Weichselian Lateglacial Interstadial. A sediment core obtained from a small lacustrine basin was analysed for multiple proxies, including lithological changes, oxygen isotopes of bulk carbonates, pollen and chironomids. It was found that the oxygen isotope record differed strongly from the other proxies. Based on a comparison with three additional lake sediment records from the same region, it emerged that the oxygen isotope records were strongly affected by local environmental conditions, impeding the distinction of a regional palaeoclimate signal. The chironomid-inferred July air temperature reconstruction produced inferred interstadial temperatures ranging between similar to 15 degrees and 18 degrees C, largely consistent with previously published results from the northern part of the Netherlands. A temporary regressive phase in the pollen record, which can be tentatively correlated with the Older Dryas, preceded the expansion of birch woodland. Despite differences between the four pollen records from the Weerterbos region, a comparable regressive vegetation phase that was possibly the result of a shift to drier conditions could be discerned in all of the profiles. In addition, a temporary temperature decline of similar to 1.5 degrees C was inferred from the chironomid record during this regressive phase. The multi-proxy approach used here enabled a direct comparison of inferred changes in temperature, vegetation and environmental conditions at an individual site, while the multi-site approach provided insight into the factors influencing the pollen and isotope records from these small-scale depressions.

We here present multiple environmental and climate proxies obtained from a lake sequence of MIS 5a age in the Sokli basin (northern Finland). Pollen/spores, plant macrofossils, NPPs (e.g. green algae), bryozoa, diatoms and chironomids allowed an exceptionally detailed reconstruction of aquatic and telmatic ecosystem successions related to the development of the Sokli Ice Lake and subsequent infilling of a relatively small and shallow lake confined to the Sokli basin. A regional vegetation development typical for the early half of an interglacial is recorded by the pollen, stomata and plant macrofossil data. Reconstructions of July temperatures based on pollen assemblages suffer from a large contribution of local pollen from the lake's littoral zone. Summer temperatures reaching present-day values, inferred for the upper part of the lake sequence, however, agree with the establishment of pine-dominated boreal forest indicated by the plant fossil data. Habitat preferences also influence the climate record based on chironomids. Nevertheless, the climate optima of the predominant intermediate- to warm-water chironomid taxa suggest July temperatures exceeding present-day values by up to several degrees, in line with climate inferences from a variety of aquatic and wetland plant indicator species. The disequilibrium between regional vegetation development and warm, insolation-forced summers is also reported for Early Holocene records from northern Fennoscandia. The MIS 5a sequence is the last remaining fossil-bearing deposit in the late Quaternary basin infill at Sokli to be studied using multi-proxy evidence. A unique detailed climate record for MIS 5 is now available for formerly glaciated northern Europe. Our studies indicate that interglacial conditions persisted into MIS 5a, in agreement with data for large parts of the European mainland, shortening the Last Glacial by some 50 ka to MIS 4-2.

Paleolake sediments from two cores fromthe Garwolin Plain (Central Poland) were subjected to diatom analysis. Altogether, 63 genera including 335 species and varieties were recognized. A clear shift in diatom composition was observed, from an assemblage dominated by periphytic species including Fragilaria sensu lato taxa to a planktonic one comprising Cyclotella sensu lato species. These changes in diatom assemblages and the relative abundance of the dominant and sub-dominant taxa indicated fluctuations in water level and regional climate oscillation. The transition from the Late Saalian to the Eemian was marked by a gradual increase in the contribution of summer-blooming diatom species, indicating the presence of a growing season and humid warm conditions, together with a rise in water level. The predominance of an alkaliphilous assemblage indicates alkaline conditions in the paleolake. The local diatom assemblage zones correspond very closely with the palynostratigraphy of the period under examination. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spring Capture Site Fidelity of Adult Muskellunge in Inland Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Behaviors that affect the distribution of fish within aquatic systems are important considerations in the design of sampling programs. Although movements consistent with reproductive homing have been documented for muskellunge Esox masquinongy in relatively large, complex systems, quantitative data describing their distribution at the restricted spatial scale relevant to small lake fisheries are lacking. We sampled muskellunge by means of fyke netting over 2 years in each of four Wisconsin lakes with surface areas between 110 and 588 ha. Individual capture locations were recorded. Each muskellunge sampled during the first year was injected with a passive integrated transponder to allow identification of the individuals recaptured during the second year. The number of recaptures with functional transponders during the second year ranged from 15 to 43 per lake. Capture site fidelity, defined as the percentage of recaptured fish being found in the same spawning area in two consecutive years, varied from 55% to 93%. The results are relevant to population estimation and broodstock collection for artificial propagation. Population estimates need to include all spawning habitats because marked and unmarked fish are not well mixed throughout the lake during the spawning season. Because repeated netting effort at the same locations among years is likely to resample individuals used for broodstock collection, netting effort should be dispersed among spawning sites.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2011	31	3					461	467		10.1080/02755947.2011.590118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.590118													WOS:000296140700006

J	Zhong, W; Cao, JY; Xue, JB; Ouyang, J				Zhong, Wei; Cao, Jiayuan; Xue, Jibin; Ouyang, Jun			Last deglacial and Holocene vegetation evolution and climate variability in the subalpine western Nanling Mountains in South China	HOLOCENE												Pollen analysis of a 236-cm-long core at Daping Swamp, a subalpine swamp in the western Nanling Mountains, provided a history of vegetation evolution that was related to climate changes in the last 15,400years. Generally, pollen data revealed a subtropical climate in the past 15,400years. In the last deglacial period (15,400-10,900 cal yr BP), the study region was characterized by evergreen and deciduous broadleaved forests. A marked warm and wet period from 15,400 to 13,200 cal yr BP, which was characterized by high frequencies of arboreal pollen, corresponded to the BOlling-AllerOd event. Significant shrinkage of evergreen-deciduous broadleaved forests and expansion of grassland from 13,200 to 10,900 cal yr BP suggested evidently cool and dry conditions that were the reflection of the Younger Dryas event. In the early Holocene (10,900-8200 cal yr BP), the glacier boundary effect might cause less warm and humid conditions relative to the middle Holocene. From 8200 to 4600 cal yr BP, pollen data reflected a marked expansion of evergreen and deciduous broadleaved forests and shrinkage of grassland, suggesting the thermal maximum that could be considered as the Holocene Optimum. From 4600 to 1500 cal yr BP, grassland exhibited expansion. Between 1500 and 600 cal yr BP, the evergreen and deciduous broadleaved forests expanded, whereas the grassland shrunk, implying a short wetter and warmer interval. After 600 cal yr BP, the grassland displayed expansion again. Broad regional correlation reflected that multiple factors including the summer monsoon, variation of sea level, ocean sea surface temperature (SST), and solar insolation may have played a role in climate changes that influenced vegetation evolution in the study area. Our results also reflected that in South China, the subalpine regions exhibited a different climate variation from that of regions with low latitude and elevation.					; Xue, Jibin/KTI-2699-2024	Xue, Jibin/0000-0003-1319-3377; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				AUG	2015	25	8					1330	1340		10.1177/0959683615584206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615584206													WOS:000357524500011
J	Pluer, BD; MacRae, PSD; Travis, J				Pluer, Benjamin D.; MacRae, Pamela S. D.; Travis, Joseph			Intraspecific Variation in Elemental Composition of the Least Killifish Tracks Spatial Variation in Periphyton Composition	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Many animals, especially freshwater fish, display significant population variation in elemental composition. How often that variation reflects patterns of interspecific variation remains under-explored. We examined the elemental composition and trophic niche of Heterandria formosa, an omnivore whose trophic position varies among populations. We studied eight populations, four from freshwater springs and four from shallow lakes. We analyzed water chemistry along with elemental composition and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in periphyton and fish to determine the extent of population variation in elemental composition and any associations it might have with variation in the composition of the basal resources or the trophic level of the fish. Water chemistry varied along a gradient from lakes with lower values of pH, higher concentrations of chlorophyll-a, and lower nitrate concentrations to springs with higher values of pH, lower chlorophyll-a concentrations, and higher nitrate concentrations. The population variation in elemental composition of the fish tracked the variation observed in the periphyton samples. There was a narrow range of C:N ratios among populations, compared with studies of other species, but differences among them were statistically significant. There was little variation in C:P and N:P ratios as well. Mantel analyses revealed that differences between pairs of populations in elemental compositions of fish were not correlated with differences in the water chemistry. The differences between pairs of populations in the percentages of carbon and nitrogen in fish were strongly correlated with the pairwise differences in those variables in the periphyton, indicating that the elemental composition of the fish tracks that of its basal resource. The average values of delta C-13 in the fish populations were highly correlated with the average values of delta C-13 in the periphyton samples at those locations. Fish populations in springs, which experience less predation pressure and display higher population densities, occupied lower trophic positions than populations in lakes, which experience more predation pressure and exhibit lower population densities. The association between the elemental composition of fish and periphyton could be driven by either bottom-up or top-down effects. The constancy of elemental composition despite variation in trophic position contrasts with well-described patterns of interspecific variation. This might reflect the limited range of variation in trophic position among populations compared to the ranges observed in interspecific analyses.																			2045-7758					OCT 14	2025	15	10							e72326	10.1002/ece3.72326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.72326								41098889					WOS:001593974700001

Acoustic manifestation of bubbles frozen in an ice sheet	ACOUSTICAL PHYSICS												Hydrocarbon sources on the ocean floor produce buoyant bubble plumes, i.e., gas flares. In winter, bubbles reaching the surface freeze in an ice sheet. Such clouds of frozen bubbles are observable in Arctic seas and are usual elements of ice sheets of lakes, e.g., Lake Baikal. Based on the general solution of the problem of scattering by a sphere in an isotropic elastic medium, the frozen bubble scattering cross section is found. The theory of multiple scattering by frozen bubble plume is derived. The structure of low-frequency resonances corresponding to collective oscillations of a bubble cloud is described.																			1063-7710					MAY	2011	57	3					391	400		10.1134/S1063771011030134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1063771011030134													WOS:000291055200014

However, data on sediment N-2 fixation have been poorly documented and the contribution of sediment N-2 fixation to the N budget in lakes has rarely been studied. In this study, N-2 fixation rates in sediments of Lake Taihu were measured periodically using the traditional acetylene reduction assay. Results showed that the highest sediment N-2 fixation rate occurred in winter in Meiliang Bay, with a value of 258nmolNkg(-1)hr(-1), and the lowest rates occurred in all seasons at some sites, with values near zero. East Taihu Bay, Meiliang Bay, the southwestern coastal area, and Zhushan Bay were found to be hotspots for sediment N-2 fixation activity. The annual N-2 fixation rate and volume in sediments of Lake Taihu were 0.083g Nm(-2)year(-1) and 195tN, respectively. The N inputs via fixation were much lower than those from river inflow, sediment release, and atmospheric deposition. This study reveals that N-2 fixation in sediments contributes only a minor part to the overall N budget, while it compensates for about 1.8% of sediment N-2 loss via denitrification. The minor contribution of sediment N-2 fixation to the overall N budget in Lake Taihu may be closely linked to sediment characteristics.

J	Wang, JD; Sheng, YW; Wada, Y				Wang, Jida; Sheng, Yongwei; Wada, Yoshihide			Little impact of the Three Gorges Dam on recent decadal lake decline across China's Yangtze Plain	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The ubiquitous lakes across China's Yangtze Plain (YP) are indispensable freshwater resources sustaining ecosystems and socioeconomics for nearly half a billion people. Our recent survey revealed a widespread net decline in the total YP lake inundation area during 2000-2011 (a cumulative decrease of approximate to 10%), yet its mechanism remained contentious. Here we uncover the impacts of climate variability and anthropogenic activities including (i) Yangtze flow and sediment alterations by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and (ii) human water consumption in agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors throughout the downstream Yangtze Basin. Results suggest that climate variability is the dominant driver of this decadal lake decline, whereas studied human activities, despite varying seasonal impacts that peak in fall, contribute marginal fraction (approximate to 10-20% or less) to the interannual lake area decrease. Given that the TGD impacts on the total YP lake area and its seasonal variation are both under approximate to 5%, we also dismiss the speculation that the TGD might be responsible for evident downstream climate change by altering lake surface extent and thus open water evaporation. Nevertheless, anthropogenic impacts exhibited a strengthening trend during the past decade. Although the TGD has reached its full-capacity water regulation, the negative impacts of human water consumption and TGD-induced net channel erosion, which are already comparable to that of TGD's flow regulation, may continue to grow as crucial anthropogenic factors to future YP lake conservation.

Unifying tephrostratigraphic approaches to redefine major Holocene marker tephras, Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												In this study, geochemical fingerprinting of glass shards and titanomagnetite phenocrysts was used to match twenty complex pyroclastic deposits from the flanks of Mt. Taranaki to major tephra fall "marker beds" in medial and distal deposition sites. These correlations hinged upon identifying time-bound compositional changes (a chemostratigraphy) in distal Taranaki tephra-fall sequences preserved in lake and peat sediment records around the volcano. The current work shows that previous soil-stratigraphy based studies led to miscorrelations, because they relied upon radiocarbon dates, a "counting back" approach, and an underestimate of the number of eruptions that actually occurred in any time frame. The new tephrostratigraphy proposed at Mt. Taranaki resulted from stratigraphic rearranging of several earlier-defined units. Some tephra units are older than previously determined (e.g., Waipuku, Tariki, and Mangatoki; similar to 6 to 9 cal ka BP), while one of the most prominent Taranaki marker tephra deposit, the Korito, is shown to lie stratigraphically above a widespread rhyolitic marker bed from Taupo volcano, the Stent Tephra (also known as unit Q; similar to 43 cal ka BP). Pyroclastic tephra deposits previously dated between similar to 6 to 4 cal ka BP at a key tephra section, c. 40 km NE of Mt. Taranald's summit, were misidentified and are now shown to comprise new marker tephra deposits, including the Kokowai (similar to 4.7 cal ka BP), which is a prominent marker horizon on the eastern flanks of the volcano. A new local proximal stratigraphy for <5 cal ka BP tephra units can be well correlated to tephra layers within distal lake and peat sequences, but the.differences between the two records indicates an overall larger number of eruptions have occurred at this volcano than previously thought. This study additionally demonstrates the utility of titanomagnetite chemistry for discrimination and correlation of groups or sequences of tephra deposits- even if unique compositions cannot be identified.

This record provides evidence that wetter Zambezian woodlands always occupied this area during the late Holocene, reaching a maximum extent between 2800 and 1650 cal yr BP related to increase in summer monsoon intensity. However, three main episodes of decline have been detected, between 3450 and 2800 cal yr BP, between 1650 and 1450 cal yr BP and from 1200 to 500 cal yr BP, for which a climatic interpretation, decrease in the summer monsoon strength, was preferentially advanced. The first is synchronous with lowstand of many tropical African lakes and, so, mainly induced by increased aridity. In contrast, the abrupt change in the pollen record at 1650-1550 cal yr BP is marked by a large extension of grasslands at the expense of arboreal cover, further by an increase in Ricinus communis and an intensification of burning. It could thus indicate local clearance of vegetation by man. However, at the same time, the decline of montane forest suggests the impact of a more regional change. During the last episode, between 1200 and 500 cal vr BR dry climatic conditions are inferred from a combination of pollen, diatom and magnetic proxies, although the occurrence of Late Iron Age settlements in the region means that local human interference cannot be excluded.

The age of 840 specimens was determined from the scales. Growth rates are very slow, compared only with those of dwarf whitefish of certain North American lakes. Food varies with the length of the fish and with the season of the year. Main food items are aquatic insects (larvae and adults), mollusks and small fishes. In 1975, spawing occurred in late Oct. (water temperature, 4.degree. C), at depths of 2-4 m; substrates utilized were sand, gravel and boulders. Spawning lasted less than 2 wk. Males mature at 390 mm (age 8) and female at 400 mm (age 9). Lake Nathalie whitefish (N = 41) showe a low relative fecundity (17,980 eggs/kg). In the fall of 1974 the population density of Lake Nathalie whitefish 350 mm and longer were estimated at 839 individuals (0.72 kg/ha).																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1978	56	6					1402	1411		10.1139/z78-193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z78-193													WOS:A1978FG80100022

This paper describes the trophic status of Lake Phewa and Kulekhani Reservoir from Nepal. Sampling was conducted during October 2017 (post-monsoon), April 2018 (Pre-monsoon), July 2018 (Monsoon) and February 2019 (Winter). Trophic State Index (TSI) as given by Carlson (1977) and Trophic State Index Deviation given by Carlson (1991) were estimated to assess trophic status and deviations between the Trophic State Indices. One-way analysis of variance showed significant seasonal variation (p<0.05) in Secchi depth, total phosphorus (TP), TSI in both the water bodies. Both the water bodies were classified as eutrophic during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, and hypereutrophic during the monsoon indicating the increased flow of allochthonous inputs from their respective catchments. Non-algal turbidity was found to be the limiting factor for productivity. There is a need for sustainable watershed management in order to reduce the nutrients runoff and accumulation in the water bodies.					; Sharma, Chhatra/A-6168-2009	Dahal, Bed Mani/0000-0002-6588-7904; 													0972-9860	1875-8568					2021	18	3					49	57		10.3233/AJW210028	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/AJW210028													WOS:000680735400007

This study investigated the fate of trace metals and radionuclides in the groundwater-evaporation lake system. Six shallow cores collected across the spring zone on the western shore of Lake Tyrrell, northwest Victoria, where groundwater enters the lake, were studied. The area chosen has anomalously high surface radioactivity. Only minor deposition of many major and trace elements is apparently occurring in the sediments. Most deposition is confined to the upper 15 cm of the sediments and, for the trace elements, concentrations were quite low. X-ray diffraction identified a thin band of alunite at approximately 4-8-cm depth which is found to be enriched with Cr, Sc, Ti, La, Y, Zr, Sr, Ba, P and Mn by factors up to 10 over surrounding sediments. Cu and Fe are the only metals enriched below 15 cm. Ra-226, the source of the anomalous radioactivity, is also enriched within the alunite band. In addition, auto-radiography of an Fe-oxide (with akaganeite)-jarosite layered sample identified jarosite as another mineral phase that sequesters Ra. Analyses of radionuclides such as Pb-210 and Ra-228 with short (< 25 yr) half-lives in the sediments suggest that the deposition of radionuclides at Lake Tyrrell has occurred within a 100-yr time span. A C-14 measurement of organic mud in the center of the zone with Cu enrichment confirmed its recent origin.

In the current study, we compare and evaluate performance of different diversity measures, i.e., commonly used simple diversity indices vs. novel complex measures incorporating ecological information of species (feeding behavior and stream zonation preferences). As a target group, we chose caddisflies, a species-rich, aquatic insect order, in different habitats of an anthropogenically unimpacted, connected karst barrage lake/riverine system. In line with our hypothesis, the complex diversity measures were more efficient in ranking and distinguishing different habitats, particularly the ones with similar communities. We also constructed a novel measure to rank the habitats by sensitivity to climate change, based on diversity of caddisfly communities and vulnerability of species inhabiting them. As expected, the springs were ranked as most vulnerable habitats. Our study further underlines the importance of integrating ecological information into biodiversity and vulnerability assessment of freshwater communities. Freshwater biodiversity is facing a severe crisis due to many human impacts, yet the diversity dynamics of freshwater communities and possibilities of assessing these are vastly unexplored. We aimed at emphasizing different aspects of portraying diversity of a species-rich, aquatic insect group (caddisflies; Trichoptera) across four different habitats in an anthropogenically unimpacted, connected karst barrage lake/riverine system. To define diversity, we used common indices with pre-set sensitivity to species abundance/dominance; i.e., sensitivity parameter (species richness, Shannon, Simpson, Berger-Parker) and diversity profiles based on continuous gradients of this sensitivity parameter: the naive and non-naive diversity profiles developed by Leinster and Cobbold. The non-naive diversity profiles show diversity profiles with regard to the similarity among species in terms of ecological traits and preferences, whereas the naive diversity profile is called mathematically "naive" as it assumes absolute dissimilarity between species that is almost never true. The commonly used indices and the naive diversity profile both ranked the springs as least diverse and tufa barriers as most diverse. The non-naive diversity profiles based on similarity matrices (using feeding behavior and stream zonation preferences of species), showed even greater differences between these habitats, while ranking stream habitats close together, regardless of their longitudinal position. We constructed the Climate Score index (CSI) in order to assess how diversity and species' vulnerability project the community's resistance and/or resilience to climate change. The CSI ranked the springs as most vulnerable, followed by all habitats longitudinally placed below them. We highlight the importance of integrating ecological information into biodiversity and vulnerability assessment of freshwater communities.					; Cetinic, Katarina/HPH-0893-2023; Ivković, Marija/AAB-1756-2020	Pozojevic, Ivana/0000-0002-4524-3001; Ivkovic, Marija/0000-0003-3188-5676; 														2075-4450				MAR	2021	12	3							234	10.3390/insects12030234	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12030234								33801793					WOS:000633761400001
J	Tiberti, R; von Hardenberg, A; Bogliani, G				Tiberti, Rocco; von Hardenberg, Achaz; Bogliani, Giuseppe			Ecological impact of introduced fish in high altitude lakes: a case of study from the European Alps	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fish introduction is a major threat to alpine lake biota leading to the loss of native species and to the degeneration of natural food-webs. This study provides an extensive investigation on the impact of the introduced fish Salvelinus fontinalis on the native communities of alpine lakes in the Gran Paradiso National Park. We compared the macroinvertebrate and zooplankton communities of six stocked and nine fishless lakes with a repeated sampling approach during the summers 2006-2009. The impact of fish presence on alpine lake fauna is often mediated by the strong seasonality governing these ecosystems, and it dramatically affects the faunal assemblage of littoral macroinvertebrates and the size, structure, and composition of the pelagic zooplankton community with a strong selective predation of the more visible taxa. Direct ecological impacts include a decrease or extinction of non-burrower macroinvertebrates and of large zooplankton species, while small zooplankton species and burrower macroinvertebrates were indirectly advantaged by fish presence. Due to the existence of a compensation between rotifers and crustaceans, fish presence does not affect total zooplankton biomass and diversity even if fish are a factor of ecological exclusion for large crustaceans. These compensatory mechanisms are a key process surrounding the impact of introduced fish in alpine lakes.					; von Hardenberg, Achaz/C-7313-2008; Tiberti, Rocco/AAM-7103-2021; Bogliani, Giuseppe/IUO-9260-2023	von Hardenberg, Achaz/0000-0002-9899-1687; Bogliani, Giuseppe/0000-0001-9066-6540; Tiberti, Rocco/0000-0003-1617-8826													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2014	724	1					1	19		10.1007/s10750-013-1696-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1696-1													WOS:000328206600001

This study systematically investigates the mechanisms underlying lake area variations on the CTP by integrating glacierized area changes derived from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform with atmospheric circulation patterns from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that the limited glacier coverage on the CTP exerted significant influence only on glacial lakes in the southern region (r = -0.65, p < 0.05). The widespread lake expansion across the CTP predominantly stems from precipitation increases (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) associated with atmospheric circulation changes. Enhanced Indian summer monsoon (ISM) activity facilitates anomalous moisture transport from the Indian Ocean to the southwestern CTP, manifesting as increased specific humidity (Qa) in summer. Simultaneously, the weakened westerly jet stream reinforces moisture convergence across the CTP, driving enhanced annual precipitation. By coupling glacier coverage variations with atmospheric processes, this research establishes that precipitation anomalies rather than glacial meltwater primarily govern the extensive lake expansion on the CTP. These findings offer critical insights for guiding ecological security strategies and sustainable development initiatives on the CTP.

Many studies have been conducted to examine erosion and deposition rates in drainage networks. In this study, we proposed a new approach using grain-size standard deviation model of sedimentary samples from different geomorphological units for numerical analysis and paleo-climate interpretation in the Shiyang River drainage basin, arid China. 1043 sedimentary samples were obtained from the upper reaches, the midstream alluvial plain and the terminal lake area; chronological frames were established based on 58 radiocarbon ages. Grain-size standard deviation model was introduced to examine sediment components according to grain-size and transport forces. In addition, transient paleo-climate simulations, including the Community Climate System Model version 3 and the Kiel models, were synthesized, as well as the results from PMIP 3.0 project, to detect the long-term climate backgrounds. Totally, we found four major common components, including fine particulates (<2 m), fine silt (2-20 m), sandy silt (20-200 m), coarse sand (>200 m), from basin-wide sedimentary samples. The fine particulates and fine silt components exist in all the sedimentary facies, showing long-term airborne aerosol changes and its transport by suspended load. There are some differences in ranges of sandy silt and coarse sand components, due to lake and river hydrodynamics, as well as the distance with the Gobi Desert. Paleo-climate simulations have shown that the strong Asian summer monsoon during the transition of the Last Deglaciation and Holocene was conducive to erosion and transport of basin-wide suspended load, also enhancing sediment sorting effects due to strong lake hydrodynamics. Our findings provide a new approach in research of long-term basin-wide sediment transport processes.					; Li, Peng-Cheng/ABC-2985-2021	Li, Yu/0000-0003-3381-5372; Zhang, Chengqi/0000-0002-2244-3377; 													0016-7363	1538-4632				JUL	2017	49	3					309	327		10.1111/gean.12123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gean.12123													WOS:000405108800003

E.; Lang, Simon C.; Werner, Mario			The interplay of fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian deposition and erosion along the Neales Cliffs and its relevance to the evolution of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, central Australia, during the Quaternary	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												A high-resolution record of fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine deposits of Late Pleistocene age is exposed along the Neales Cliff in the lower reaches of the Nappamurra-Neales River, western Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre (KT-LE). Five major stratigraphic units reflect a variety of changes in sedimentary processes, depositional environments and hence palaeo-lake level fluctuations. This detailed record of a dryland terrestrial sedimentary succession in the northern part of KT-LE enables comparison to contemporaneous sequences in the southern part of KT-LE. The sedimentary record from the Neales Cliff area is placed into a continental stratigraphic framework, in which changes in sediment accumulation and depositional style are linked to climatically driven palaeo-lake level fluctuations independent of eustatic sea-level changes. Following the similar to 200 ka interglacial maximum, a drying-up systems tract is represented by a fluvial fining-upward trend, capped by palaeosols. A wettening-up systems tract followed, when lake level rose to +10 m AHD during the last interglacial, resulting in a lacustrine succession but punctuated by regular desiccation events. During the following drying-up systems tract, progressive lake-level fall resulted in deep incision around 100 ka, followed by enhanced fluvial deposition of fine-grained sediments. A brief rise in base level resulted in a wettening-up systems tract comprising a thin veneer of fluvial/alluvial sediments followed by extensive dune build-up and desert pavement development during the Last Glacial Maximum. Subsequent lake level fall to the present lake level of -15 m AHD, resulted in deep incision of up to 10 m by the modern day Nappamurra-Neales River.

J	Hein, A				Hein, Ants			ESTONIAN PEASANT IN IMAGES. NOTES ON THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE PORTRAIT ART IN ESTONIA	ACTA HISTORICA TALLINNENSIA												It goes without saying that people who used to be portrayed in Estonia belonged among the wealthiest and most powerful in society. Representatives of the lower classes, including the peasantry, were as a rule not portrayed, and if they were depicted at all, the aim was to record their typical clothes or jobs they were carrying out at the moment. Thus the first pictures of faces of Estonian peasants appeared as late as the turn of the 17th-18th centuries, although even then these images were not really portraits, as these largely constituted just some sort of 'labels' on the presents the peasants made to their local church, for example, portraits of two peasants at Kirna manor in Jarva County, Natsa Ants (Netze Hans) and Reegla Jaan (Rekela Jahn). These images were on the frame of an oil painting Adoration of the Shepherds, donated by the two men to the church in Tun in spring 1692. The same can be seen in the glass painting technique portraits of two Lohusuu peasants, Johan Karlipoeg (Johan Carl Soh) and Vadi Andres (Andres Hans Poick), donated to the church at Lohusuu near Lake Peipsi together with new windows in 1723. A totally different, more detailed manner is represented, for example, by two watercolour portraits of peasants in western Saaremaa, painted in the early 1740s by a missionary despatched there from Moravian Brethren in Herrnhut in Germany. Depicting Estonians in portraits began to develop only in the early 19th century. Considerable changes had taken place in society by that time; so even some Estonians could afford to have portraits painted of himself and his wife, e.g. a coachman called Magnus Jonassohn, who operated in the Tallinn suburb in front of the Small Coastal Gate, and also Matz Erdell, known as the first lord of the manor of Estonian descent. The first artists emerged who regarded depicting Estonian peasants as a creative challenge, for example Gerhard von Reutern (1794-1865), August Pezold (1794-1859) and Gustav Adolf Hippius (1792-1856). The most gifted of them was Gerhard von Reutern, although the period when he was able to paint local peasants was rather short, from summer 1830 to summer 1832. He nevertheless managed to record local peasants in dozens of highly skilled watercolours and drawings. Pezold's best work primarily includes a series of lithographs completed in 1832-1834, also works produced during the expedition organized by the Russian Geographical Society in 1846. The highlights in the creative work of Hippius are two portraits of his maidservant Miina painted in 1852, one showing her as a bride and the other as a young wife. Portraits of some Estonian intellectuals are known from the same period, e.g. of Kristjan Jaak Peterson (artist Franz Burchard Dorbeck, 1822) and Friedrich Robert Faehlmann (August Georg Wilhelm Pezold, 1833; Eduard Hau, about 1838). The final part of the article also tries to analyse how the earlier portraits of peasants were actually received among the peasants themselves. Surprisingly enough, quite a few depicted people later suffered painful, almost tragic consequences. For example, a young man from Rapla parish, portrayed by Elizabeth Rigby in 1839, was much despised for it by his own peers. Villem Tamm from Kassari Island was painted just once in June 1863 by Johann Koler. However, he was later regarded as a firm prototype in the best known sacral painting in Estonia, i.e. Koler's fresco Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened completed in 1879 for the Kaarli Church in Tallinn.																			1406-2925	1736-7476					2018	24	1					49	77		10.3176/hist.2018.1.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3176/hist.2018.1.03													WOS:000450233600003

In three enclosure experiments, different combinations of phosphate, nitrate and ammonium additions were tested both with and without additions of dissolved iron. The addition of iron increased the growth of diazotrophic cyanobacteria significantly compared with enclosures not receiving iron. This was especially evident for the colony-forming cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata. Tn one experiment, colonies of G.echinulata disappeared in enclosures not receiving iron, while the abundance of this species increased in those enclosures to which iron was added.

J	Alt, M; McWethy, DB; Whitlock, C				Alt, Mio; McWethy, David B.; Whitlock, Cathy			Postglacial fire and vegetation histories of a mid-elevation mixed-conifer forest in the Gallatin Range, MT, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A 13,500-year-old record from Langohr Wetland in the Gallatin Range of southwestern Montana offers new insights into the vegetation and fire history at middle elevations within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Pollen data suggest that following deglaciation, a tundra-steppe established until warmer and wetter conditions than before could support Picea parkland. The development of an open, predominantly Pinus mixed-conifer forest from ca. 9300-7000 cal yr BP suggests warming summer temperatures led to an increase in forest cover and fire activity; the increase in tree abundance supported infrequent, stand-replacing fires approximately every 600 years. Picea and Pseudotsuga increased their presence at ca. 7000 cal yr BP, and the mixed-conifer forest became denser during the Mid- and Late Holocene, suggesting summers became cooler and wetter. The additional fuel load led to increased fire activity, with stand-replacing fires occurring approximately every 350 years in the Late Holocene. The forest surrounding Langohr Wetland experienced less change in vegetation composition and structure and fewer fire episodes than other low- and high-elevation sites in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The stability of this forested ecosystem over thousands of years is likely a result of its cool mesic mid-elevation setting, limiting the frequency of intense fire episodes.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				SEP	2025	127						107	121		10.1017/qua.2025.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2025.16		JUN 2025											WOS:001514060700001

These data sets can play a pivotal role in determining natural baseline conditions, detecting early evidence of change, identifying the causal mechanisms of water quality deterioration, and in gauging the success of remediation measures. At most sites, however, such data are sparse or completely lacking. New advances in paleolimnology, that is the study of past environments based on the analysis of sediments, offer considerable potential for reconstructing these historical records. This paleolimnological approach is illustrated by way of water quality research on three ecosystems in Quebec, Canada. Lake St-Augustin is a small lake characterized by episodes of bottom-water anoxia and summer blooms of cyanobacteria that result in its municipal closure to swimming and other lake activities for several weeks each summer. A paleolimnological analysis based on fossil diatoms showed that there have been four phases of nutrient enrichment over the last 240 years coinciding with initial colonisation and land development (1760-1900), farm development (1900-1950), increased fertiliser use and intensification of agriculture (1950-1980), and major road and residential expansion (1980-present). The paleolimnological application of diatom-based transfer functions for total phosphorus analysis of Lake St-Charles; the principal drinking water supply for Quebec City, showed that substantial changes took place in the lake coincident with the raising of water level in the 1930s. There was no evidence of increasing eutrophication since that time, contrary to public perception. Finally, geochemical analysis of sediments in the St-Lawrence River showed greatly reduced concentrations of heavy metals and other pollutants over the period 1960-90, but the paleolimnological record also underscores the need for ongoing improvements in pollution control measures.

In this study, the Tianchi Lake, a typical cold-water lake and a UNESCO/MAB (Man and Biosphere) nature reserve located in high latitude and elevation with the relatively low intensity of human activity was chosen as a system to examine the linkages between climate change and eutrophication. As a part of the UNESCO Bogda Man and Biosphere Reserve, Tianchi Lake has been well preserved for prevention from human intervention, but why has it been infected with eutrophication recent years? Our results show that climate change played a significant role in the eutrophication in the Tianchi Lake. Increased temperature, changed precipitation pattern and wind-induced hydrodynamic fluctuations in the summer season were suggested to make a major contribution to the accelerated eutrophication. The results also showed that the local temperature and precipitation changes were closely linked to the large-scale atmospheric circulation, which opens the door for the method to be applied in other regions without local climatic information.

Sedimentary vanadium depletion under sulfidic conditions: Implications for (paleo)redox proxy applications	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Sedimentary concentrations of redox-sensitive trace metals are widely used to reconstruct past ocean redox conditions. Vanadium (V) has great potential as a (paleo)redox proxy, due to its strong redox-dependent speciation (+III, +IV, +V) and the increased sedimentary sequestration of its more reduced species. The geochemistry of V in sulfide-rich marine environments is not yet well understood, however, hampering the use of V as a (paleo)redox proxy. Here, we present V data for two coastal systems, with bottom water redox conditions ranging from oxic to euxinic, to further constrain V geochemistry. Our sedimentary record from a eutrophic coastal marine basin (Scharendijke basin, Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands), covering the last decade, shows distinct enrichments in molybdenum (Mo) and organic carbon (C-org) but depletions in V during seasonal bottom water euxinia, which can be discerned due to the exceptionally high sedimentation rate at our study site (up to 20 cm yr(-1)). A seasonal study for the same coastal basin confirms this trend and reveals the accumulation of V, iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in the water column during summer euxinia. We conclude that the slow kinetics of V reduction to V(III) and subsequent precipitation as (oxy)hydroxide V(OH)(3(s)) likely provide the opportunity for V to escape sedimentary sequestration during summer euxinia, resulting in the observed sedimentary V depletion. Sediments from three sites with contrasting bottom water redox conditions (oxic, seasonally hypoxic, euxinic) in the eutrophic Stockholm Archipelago, show a similar trend as that of Lake Grevelingen, with decreasing V concentrations and increasing Mo and C-org concentrations as bottom water conditions become more reducing. This confirms that our findings for Lake Grevelingen are not site-specific and are likely a generic feature of euxinic coastal systems with high sulfide concentrations (> 0.5 mmol L-1) near the sediment surface and high rates of anaerobic degradation of organic matter. Our results show that co-occurring sedimentary Mo and C-org enrichments and V depletion (or absence or suppression of an enrichment) are indicators of strongly sulfidic conditions in such settings. Finally, we show that maxima in sedimentary molar V/Mn ratios correlate with strongly reducing conditions. This finding contrasts with prior work on V/Mn ratios as a (paleo)redox proxy, implying that further research is necessary.

Influences of meteorological conditions, runoff, and bathymetry on summer thermal regime of a Great Lakes estuary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												To better understand the primary drivers of the thermal regime in a Great Lakes estuary, and their implications for local biota, water temperature variations in the Milwaukee Estuary of Lake Michigan were studied between July and October of 2019 using a network of 25 sensors at 18 locations. Like Lake Michigan, the estuary was thermally stratified July to October, and historically dredged channels with water depths greater than 6 m allowed for the free movement of cold lake water into the estuary. However, temperatures in the estuary fluctuated rapidly both spatially and temporally, reflecting lake temperature fluctuations driven by changing meteorological conditions. Lake-driven upwelling and downwelling events influenced water temperature more than tributary contributions. Periodic upwelling and downwelling events caused temperature changes by up to 15 degrees C in less than 24 h. Nearshore upwelling events occasionally allowed cold, hypolimnetic lake water to reach tributary portions of the estuary beyond dredged areas, while downwelling events disrupted thermal stratification and caused the deep, dredged portions of the estuary to exceed 20 degrees C. Thermal impacts from these events were especially noticeable in transition zones between dredged and not dredged channels less than 2 m deep. The warming effects from downwelling persisted longer inside the estuary - up to two weeks - than cooling effects from upwelling, which typically lasted a few days. The predominantly lake-driven, rapid summer water temperature fluctuations observed in the Milwaukee Estuary serve as an important consideration in habitat restoration activities happening in Great Lakes estuaries.																			0380-1330					OCT	2024	50	5							102416	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102416		SEP 2024											WOS:001324713400001

Then, based on the long-term time series data, we quantified the responses of cyanobacterial dynamics to nutrient enrichment and climatic conditions. Chla showed substantial spatial and temporal variability. In addition, the annual mean cyanobacterial surface bloom area exhibited an increasing trend across the entire lake from 2003 to 2013, with the exception of 2006 and 2007. High air temperature and phosphorus levels in the spring can prompt cyanobacterial growth, and low wind speeds and low atmospheric pressure levels favor cyanobacterial surface bloom formation. The sensitivity of cyanobacterial dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region. Our results indicate that temperature is the most important factor controlling Chla inter-annual variability followed by phosphorus and that air pressure is the most important factor controlling cyanobacterial surface bloom formation followed by wind speeds in Lake Taihu.

Ranges of mean lipid content relative to ash-free dry weight (AFDW) throughout the year were as follows: amphipods (Pontoporeia hoyi), 21-54%; lumbriculid oligochaetes (Stylodrilus heringianus), 12-19%; tubificid oligochaetes, 9-22%; chironomid larvae, 9-39%; and Mysis relicta, 26-37%. A pattern of increasing lipid content during spring was observed for P. hoyi, chironomids, and M. relicta, but seasonal changes were not apparent for oligochaetes. Excluding M.relicta, P. hoyi accounted for about 65% of the biomass and 70% of the energycontained in southern Lake Michigan benthic macroinvertebrates and may assimilate up to 30% of the total bioavailable organic detritus settling into the offshore hypolimnion. Calculation of the predation loss rate (production rate minus nonpredatory death rate) of P. hoyi indicated that about 13000 cal .cntdot. m-2 (2.1 g AFDW .cntdot. m-2) of this amphipod may be consumed annually by fish and other predators in southern Lake Michigan.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	11					1827	1832		10.1139/f85-229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-229													WOS:A1985AUV0200018
J	Fan, QD; Li, XF; Li, H				Fan, Qindong; Li, Xiaofeng; Li, Hu			Crowd Gathering and Thermal Comfort Research in Different Park Shading Spaces	SUSTAINABILITY												The thermal comfort of different shaded spaces in parks varies noticeably, and it is also a key factor influencing crowd gathering. Longzi Lake Beach Park in Zhengzhou was used as a study area in this research. For analysis, a thermal comfort index for three different space types (unshaded, semi-shaded, and fully-shaded) and a crowd aggregation index were used. The results show that during autumn, visitors are sensitive to the thermal comfort in different shaded spaces, and that the location of the playing field differs significantly. Air temperature and solar radiation are the two factors that influence tourists' thermal comfort the most. For the first time, a regression relationship between physiological equivalent temperature (PET) and mean thermal sensation vote (MTSV) is established in different shading spaces. It clarified the thermal comfort of tourists in different shaded spaces. PET and crowd aggregation index show a clear correlation. The correlation between the MTSV and crowd aggregation density increased with the increase in shade area. For the first time, the relationship between thermal comfort and crowd gathering in different shaded spaces in parks was analysed. The research is beneficial to improving the scientificity of the construction of the park's thermal environment, and providing people with more comfortable outdoor space from the perspective of shading.

This study presents a model to evaluate land suitability for cultivation of citrus in Antalya Province of Turkey. The aim of this study is to provide a Geographical Information System-Multi Criteria Evaluation based spatial decision support system, taking into account the viewpoints of local citrus growers and experts. 13 exclusion criteria, 3 main evaluation criteria (13 sub-criteria), and 52 value ranges were determined for citrus land suitability analysis. Analytic Hierarchy Process was utilised to calculate the weights of evaluation criteria. Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation approach was used to estimate the values of meteorological parameters. Thematic maps were presented for each of the criteria and final suitability map was prepared using Weighted Overlay method in Geographic Information System environment. The final suitability thematic map showed that the suitable zones (1281.19 km(2)) for citrus cultivation were located in the coastal regions of Antalya province. The average temperature in the winter season was determined to be the most important sub-criteria for citrus cultivation, followed by elevation, the average temperature in the flowering period, land use capability, daily average sunshine time, annual average precipitation, proximity to irrigation ponds and dam lakes and others. Most of the cultivated citrus orchards often coincided with the appropriate sites presented as a result of the study, and most of these sites were generally classified as high and moderate suitable zones. This study will be an important and useful regional guideline in terms of agricultural land use planning, citrus orchards management and community.

Hydrothermal waters of Dominica cover a wide spectrum of pH, temperatures and chemical composition. The pH of the thermal waters ranges from acidic to neutral (pH values of 1-7.8) and the waters are predominantly Na-SO4 in character (Na = 14-2127 mg/L; SO4 = 1-1725 mg/L), likely formed as a result of dilution of acidic H2S-rich gases in near surface oxygenated groundwater, and have experienced limited water-rock interaction. The geochemical composition of the waters for most of the hydrothermal systems studied indicate no significant changes, with the exception of the Boiling Lake, which experienced a short (-6 week) episode of instability in November 2016 which appeared to be associated with a small mud-rich explosion. Unlike the last such event in December 2004, which was reported to be earthquake-triggered, this event is possibly the consequence of a moderate-sized landslide into the lake. The lake draining episodes have been accompanied by changes in composition between Na-SO4 and Na-Cl, which is attributed to hydrothermal fluid contributions from two different aquifers: a shallower acid-sulphate hydrothermal aquifer and a deeply-sourced brine aquifer. Reservoir temperatures determined by quartz geothermometers have not changed significantly over the monitoring period, suggesting steady-state degassing of the magma chambers. In two areas, temperatures have increased: Watten Waven (from 83-90 degrees C to 89-139 degrees C) and Sulphur Springs (from 145-152 degrees C to 93-243 degrees C). The elevated reservoir temperatures have affected the isotopic composition of the waters (delta O-18 = - 5.7 to 9.1%. and 6D = -8 to 20.5%.,), that reflect a dominantly meteoric source, with boiling/degassing and evaporation also playing an important role. The time series data suggests that some hydrothermal areas are experiencing increased steam evaporation over time whereas other waters are becoming more meteoric. The delta C-13(DIC) is decoupled from the deuterium and oxygen-18 isotopes and shows very little variation over time, but a broad range in values from -11 to +5%.The dominant process contributing to delta C-13(DIC) is degassing of primarily magmatic CO2, as exhibited by the bubbling pools. Hydrothermal streams have experienced mixing with biogenic CO2 sources, including plant respiration and methanogenesis. The slight variations observed from site to site are likely a consequence of fractional degassing of the magma chamber during exsolution of CO2. Over the sampling period 2014-2017, the temperatures and delta C-13 values do not change, which suggests a current steady-state of degassing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abrupt warming and alpine glacial retreat through the last deglaciation in Alaska interrupted by modest Northern Hemisphere cooling	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Alpine glacier-based temperature reconstructions spanning the last deglaciation provide critical constraints on local to regional climate change and have been reported from several formerly glaciated regions around the world yet remain sparse from high-northern-latitude regions. Using newly and previously 10 Be-dated moraines, we report paleo-glacier equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) for 15 time slices spanning the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) for a valley in the western Alaska Range. We translate our ELA reconstructions into a proxy for summer temperature by applying a dry adiabatic lapse rate at each reconstructed ELA relative to the outermost LIA moraine. We observe similar to 4 degrees C warming through the last deglaciation at our site that took place in two steps following initial gradual warming: similar to 1.5 degrees C abrupt warming at 16 ka, similar to 2 kyr after the onset of global CO 2 rise, and similar to 2 degrees C warming at similar to 15 ka, near the start of the Bolling. Moraine deposition and modest summer cooling during Heinrich Stadial 1 and the early Younger Dryas (YD) suggest that despite these events being expressed more strongly in wintertime, the classic blueprint of North Atlantic climate variability extends to the western Arctic region.

Nest-site selection, nesting behaviour and spatial ecology of female Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in South Africa	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES												Nesting biology and ecology have been investigated for Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), but information on behaviour and movement patterns of nesting females during nest guarding is scant. Consequently, we investigated the home ranges, nest-site selection strategies, movement patterns, activity levels and nest fidelity of four nesting females using telemetry. Gravid females selected winter basking/breeding areas close (351 +/- 2m) to nest-sites. Mean home range and core-use areas of nesting females were 8539 +/- 4752 m(2), and 4949 +/- 3302 m(2) respectively. Mean home range (0.85 ha) was significantly smaller than those of non-nesting females (108.4 ha) during nesting season. Activity levels and mean daily movements while nesting were 8.1 +/- 2.5% and 213 +/- 64 m, respectively, and increased to 47.9 +/- 11.7% and 2176 708 m post-nesting. Overall levels of nest fidelity were 82.8 +/- 11.7%, (day 78.1 +/- 15.9%; night 87.3 7.8%). Highest nest fidelity recorded during incubation was 99.7% over 96 days. Telemetry data from nesting females were helpful for elucidating spatial and behavioural patterns during the nest guarding period, and provided novel insights into this biologically important event.

This hypothesis has been proposed because of midsummer blooms of blue-green algae in this eutrophic urban lake. We tested the hypothesis by performing in situ food manipulations during the midsummer decline of the D. pulicaria population, and during the early autumn low population period. In July, animals held in clear plastic vials containing GF/F filtered lake water exhibited poor survivorship, ceased producing offspring after three days, and had low lipid reserves. Daphnids fed whole-lake water or filtered water enriched with Chlamydomonas survived at a significantly higher rate and produced abundant offspring. In September, there were no significant differences in survivorship among treatments, but animals fed water enriched with Chlamydomonas produced significantly more offspring than animals in the other treatments. The hypothesis of poor food quality causing the midsummer decline of the Daphnia population is not supported by our experiments. Because predation by juvenile fish does not appear to be important in regulating the midsummer Daphnia population during these years, alternate hypotheses for the midsummer decline are suggested. These include increased predation by invertebrate predators such as Leptodora kindtii, a life history shift by daphnids during midsummer to production of resting eggs, and a combination of low levels of planktivory and deteriorating feeding conditions acting together to cause the population decline.					; De+Stasio, Bart/W-9030-2019	Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368; Soranno, Patricia/0000-0003-1668-9271													0018-8158					JUL 7	1995	307	1-3					221	230		10.1007/BF00032016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00032016													WOS:A1995RY51900028
J	O'Hare, G; Rivas, S				O'Hare, G; Rivas, S			The landslide hazard and human vulnerability in La Paz City, Bolivia	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Landslides in the city of La Paz, Bolivia are complex in space and time. Their distribution within the city is differentiated by geographical variations in slope gradient, the nature of overlying surface deposits, and drainage density patterns. When mapped, the distribution of the most landslide-prone locations in the city coincides with the most mobile surface deposits on the higher and steeper slopes of the city. The timing of landslides is triggered when slope materials become saturated with moisture by rainfall, stream water, water seepage from high surrounding water tables, and from domestic sources. Landslide frequencies over the last 40 years show the role of inter-annual variations in summer rainfalls, especially the late summer period (Jan-Mar), and rising water tables connected to Lake Titicaca. Associations with ENSO events, both warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina), prove negative, pointing to the importance of moisture sources from the north, south and east (Amazon) but not from the west (Pacific). The most vulnerable group exposed to the landslide hazard comprise the inhabitants of the self-built informal housing areas who occupy the more elevated steeper slopes of the northern part of the city. But societal vulnerability to earth movement in the city is widespread and interconnected. Higher income groups in the southern part of the city are affected by slower, if less dramatic, forms of land failure, and rich housing in downstream areas of the city are impacted by flash flooding encouraged by deforestation on the northern hill slopes where the poor live. Two case studies highlight the vulnerability and plight of the inhabitants of the self-built settlements in the aftermath of a major landslide, and a brief discussion of hazard mitigation and the importance of building hazard resilient communities concludes the paper.

The creation of snags through live-tree death varied by species, ranging from 0.24% year-1 for eastern white cedar to 5.60% year-1 for balsam fir. Snag breakage was best described as a function of snag height and snag fall described as a function of tree species, decay stage, and diameter. Long LW pieces and pieces generated close to the lake were more likely to be deposited at the shoreline. The density of LW at the shoreline was 125-550 pieces center dot km-1, and density and volume of LW were positively related to riparian slope. LW was a stable resource at the shoreline, with a recruitment rate about equal to the loss rate and average movement along the shoreline of 2.89 cm center dot year-1. LW volumes at the shoreline and in the littoral zone of the lake were positively related to lakebed slope. LW could reside in the littoral zone for centuries, providing physical structure for multiple generations of aquatic organisms in these small lakes. Our results indicate that critical habitat for fish that need aquatic LW extends at least 5 m into riparian forest and that removal of trees within 5 m of the forest edge would reduce LW input to the littoral zone.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				MAY	2022	52	5					751	768		10.1139/cjfr-2021-0245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2021-0245		FEB 2022											WOS:000789633500001

In this study, we quantitatively reconstruct the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) of Serling Co since 17.3 cal kyr BP using a novel terrestrial thermometer (ring index of OH-GDGTs, RI-OH), and reconstructed the hydroclimatic evolutionary history in combination with n-alkanes and their associated proxies. Our temperature records indicate that Serling Co experienced a period of reduced temperatures during the Younger Dryas event, approximately 6 degrees C cooler than the present conditions. Subsequently, there was a rapid warming phase, leading to peak temperatures in the early Holocene, roughly 5.5 degrees C warmer than the modern MAAT, followed by a protracted cooling trend during the subsequent middle and late Holocene. The temperature and hydroclimate trends at Serling Co exhibit a synchronized evolutionary pattern since the last deglaciation, featuring an optimal hydrothermal combination in the early Holocene. This period witnessed the peak productivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, followed by a gradual decline. Summer insolation emerges as a primary controlling factor for temperature variations, with Indian Summer Monsoon intensity and internal climate system variability exerting dominance over atmospheric moisture and precipitation variations in the region.

In particular, conditions that fell within "small drop" and "large drop" regimes are related to cloud and stability profiles, providing insight regarding whether the clouds are tied to the local boundary layer. These findings are supported by analysis of flight data from other parts of North America and used to provide context for several icing incidents and accidents where large-drop icing was noted as a contributing factor. The relationships described for drop size discrimination in continental environments provide clues that can be applied for both human- and model-generated icing forecasts, as well as automated icing algorithms.

Despite a certain symmetry of seasonal precipitation patterns along the PEP 1 transect, decadal variability of winter precipitation shows different characteristics in terms of amplitude and frequency in both the last 100 and last 1000 years. Such differences in variability are also seen in a comparison of time series of different El Nino/Southern Oscillation proxy records from North and South America, however, these differences do not appear to affect the spatial correlation with Pacific sea surface temperature patterns. Local and regional differences in response to climate change are even more pronounced for records with lower temporal resolution, and inter-hemispheric synchroneity may or may not be indicative of the same forcing. This aspect is illustrated in an inter-hemispheric comparison of the last 1000 years of glacier variability, and of the full- and lateglacial lake level history. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, the zooplankton of a small neotropical lake was studied at different times during one year and compared with changes in the lake conditions and in phytoplankton composition. The lake stratifies from March until September, and mixes during the hemispherical winter, from October until February. Besides the lake show a seasonal fluctuation in water level according to the seasonality of rains. Zooplankton was composed of at least 13 species, four Cladocerans, three Copepods, four Rotifers and other groups such as an Ostracod and the larvae of Chaoborus. The most abundant were Thermocyclops sp., Daphnia sp. and Keratella tropica. Their abundance fluctuated along the year, probably in response to changes in lake level and changes in hydrological conditions, increasing during dry season when the main outlet of the lake dried up. Changes in phytoplankton composition do not seem to be as relevant for zooplankton variation in this small lake.

Cleaner air reveals growing influence of climate on dissolved organic carbon trends in northern headwaters	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Surface water browning, the result of increasing concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM), has been widespread in northern ecosystems in recent decades. Here, we assess a database of 426 undisturbed headwater lakes and streams in Europe and North America for evidence of trends in DOM between 1990 and 2016. We describe contrasting changes in DOM trends in Europe (decelerating) and North America (accelerating), which are consistent with organic matter solubility responses to declines in sulfate deposition. While earlier trends (1990-2004) were almost entirely related to changes in atmospheric chemistry, climatic and chemical drivers were equally important in explaining recent DOM trends (2002-2016). We estimate that riverine DOM export from northern ecosystems increased by 27% during the study period. Increased summer precipitation strengthened upward dissolved organic carbon trends while warming apparently damped browning. Our results suggest strong but changing influences of air quality and climate on the terrestrial carbon cycle, and on the magnitude of carbon export from land to water.

Marie (SSM), and Traverse City, Ml, to identify spatial and temporal variation in organochlorine (OC) vapors in the central and upper Great Lakes region. Average annual and maximum concentrations of Sigma PCB were highest at Traverse and lowest at SSM. PCB 8+5 dominated the congener mix, except at Traverse in the summer. Maxima of HCB, alpha- and gamma-HCH, DDT, and DDE were observed at Traverse or Saginaw, except one unusual event at SSM in May. All compound concentrations varied seasonally at all sites except alpha-HCH. Correlations measuring regression strength between air temperature and OC concentrations show Saginaw affected most by local sources, and SSM affected the least. Among compounds with high vapor pressure, correlations were low at Traverse indicating nonlocal sources. The spatial and temporal differences observed may limit prediction of regional atmospheric trends of these compounds.					; Hermanson, Mark/ACK-5258-2022	Hermanson, Mark/0000-0002-3557-523X; 													0013-936X					DEC	1996	30	12					3464	3472		10.1021/es960093d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es960093d													WOS:A1996VV20500031

Starting with the Natural Resources Canada earthquake catalogue, we use a spectral ratio method to calculate the static stress drops of a group of relocated earthquakes ranging from December 2013 to June 2015. We find that stress drops fall within the high side of the typical reported range of tectonic events and show no correlation with earthquake magnitude, depth, or distance from the well. The stress drops appear roughly constant for events with M-w 3 to 4. Relocated hypocenters cluster both spatially and temporally around corresponding injection wells and appear to migrate deeper with increasing time from injection. Fine-scale lineations apparent in relocated hypocenters could indicate the presence and orientation of fault planes, consistent with the published focal mechanism solutions of M 4+ events in the area.

This study aims to simulate the summer LSWT long-term trends of 81 TP lakes during 1980-2018 and quantify the impacts and contributions of atmospheric variables. Results show that TP lakes warmed with 0.32 degrees C decade-1 on average. Northern TP lakes warmed faster than the southern ones (0.44 vs. 0.16 degrees C decade-1) due to stronger trends of atmospheric variables and higher sensitive of colder lakes to atmospheric changes. 55 (67.9%) lakes of the total lakes studied in current work warmed slower than air due to weakened shortwave radiation (SW down arrow). Attribution analysis suggests that the air warming and wetting over TP dominate lakes' warming. Regarding synthesis contributions, air warming contributed 79.3%, with increased surface air temperature (SAT) and downward longwave radiation (LW down arrow) accounting for 41.6% and 37.7%, respectively, and air wetting indicated by increased surface specific humidity (SSH) contributed 39.0%, followed by a positive contribution (16.8%) from declined wind speed (WS). The negative contribution (-35.1%) from weakened SW down arrow nearly counterbalances the positive effects of increased LW down arrow. 55.1% of the total synthesis contribution arises from the cross contribution through interactions among atmospheric variables and is mainly reflected in SAT and SSH, accounting for 26.8% and 24.8%, respectively. The findings enhance understanding of climate change impacts on lake systems and offer insights for lake resource management.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019; Huang, Anning/K-7473-2019	Huang, Anning/0000-0001-9872-440X; Wen, Lijuan/0000-0001-9243-9499														2333-5084				DEC	2024	11	12							e2024EA003910	10.1029/2024EA003910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024EA003910													WOS:001379275100001

Other than EE2, all selected EDCs were detected at least once in the lake water with concentrations a parts per thousand currency sign89.1 ng/L. EDCs were detected with greater occurrence in spring than in other seasons. In lake sediment, TCS was detected at the greatest concentration (30.9 ng g(-1)), whereas BPA and EE2 were not detected. Spatial distribution of the EDCs in the lake water and the lake sediment showed similar patterns, and greater EDC residuals were found from those sites with known wastewater input. The linear adsorption coefficients (K (d)) varied from 17.9 to 1,017 L kg(-1) and were related to the octanol-water partition coefficient (K (ow)) values of the compounds. Photodegradation was a major process removing the EDCs from the lake water, and the presence of dissolved organic material and NO3 (-) in the lake water can accelerate the photodegradation process. Degradation of the EDCs in the lake sediment was relatively slow and occurred mainly due to the microbial processes. All compounds were found more persistent under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions.

The ratio of independent meteorites to total number of specimens (similar to0.6) is among the highest in the world. This is due to lack of initial deep burial of the small meteorites, significant deflation of the lake exposing falls of individual stones (or small numbers of paired meteorites), and the absence of a large meteorite shower in the region.

High predictability of the seasonal dynamics of a species-like Polynucleobacter population in a freshwater lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												One of the key questions in microbial ecology is if seasonal patterns of bacterial community composition (BCC) observed in one year repeat in the following years. We have investigated if the recorded annual dynamics of a species-like Polynucleobacter (subcluster PnecB) population allowed the prediction of the population dynamics in another year. The abundance of PnecB bacteria in the pelagic of temperate Lake Mondsee was investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) over three consecutive years. The PnecB bacteria formed a persistent population, and were present in the entire water body of the lake. Two of the three investigated years differed strongly in summer temperatures and precipitation, which resulted in markedly different growth conditions. But despite of these different environmental conditions, the PnecB population demonstrated remarkably similar seasonal dynamics in the three investigated years. Water temperature was the best predictor of the population dynamics during the first half of the annual cycles. Statistical analysis also indicated influences of phytoplankton and metazooplankton successions on the PnecB population dynamics. Furthermore, 65 lakes and ponds were investigated for the presence of PnecB bacteria. They were detected in the majority (78%) of circum-neutral and alkaline freshwater habitats, but not in any investigated acidic or saline habitat.

J	Munroe, JS; Laabs, BJC				Munroe, Jeffrey S.; Laabs, Benjamin J. C.			Latest Pleistocene history of pluvial Lake Franklin, northeastern Nevada, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												At its maximum extent during the last glacial cycle, Lake Franklin covered 1100 km(2) of the Ruby Valley of northeastern Nevada, making it one of the largest pluvial lakes between Lakes Bonneville and Lahontan. Mapping of shorelines, surveying of topographic profiles, and radiocarbon dating of gastropod shells were employed to reconstruct the latest Pleistocene history of the lake. During the first half of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Lake Franklin covered similar to 42% of its maximum area. This extent increased to similar to 60% during the second half of the LGM. Some radiocarbon ages suggest that the lake briefly rose to near its highstand between 20 and 18 ka, but the best constrained rise occurred ca. 17 ka, when the lake rapidly transgressed to its highstand elevation of 1850 m. This rise was synchronous with highstands of nearby pluvial lakes, implicating a regional shift in the balance between precipitation and potential evaporation. The lake dropped to 1843 m, before rising once more to 1850 m ca. 16.0 ka. After falling and stabilizing at 1843 m again ca. 15.4 ka, the lake rapidly regressed to <1818 m (a loss in area of >70%) by 14.8 ka. This regression was synchronous with the fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline and the regression of Lake Lahontan from the Sehoo shoreline. Radiocarbon ages and stratigraphic evidence document a final transgression in the latest Pleistocene that reached 1820 m (34% of maximum area) ca. 13.0 ka, synchronous with the Recess Peak Glaciation in the Sierra Nevada, and overlapping with the start of the Younger Dryas and minor transgressions of Lakes Bonneville, Lahontan, and Owens. The correspondence of this Lake Franklin history with other climate archives from this region underscores the value of pluvial lake deposits as sources of paleoclimate information and indicates synchronous forcing of climate changes during the last glacial-interglacial transition.

J	Perriquet, M; Leonardi, V; Henry, T; Jourde, H				Perriquet, Marie; Leonardi, Veronique; Henry, Tiernan; Jourde, Herve			Saltwater wedge variation in a non-anthropogenic coastal karst aquifer influenced by a strong tidal range (Burren, Ireland)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Spatial and temporal changes in saltwater wedges in coastal karst aquifers are still poorly understood, largely due to complex mixing processes in these heterogeneous environments, but also due to anthropogenic forcing such as pumping, which commonly affect natural variations in wedges. The purpose of this study was first to characterize the hydrodynamic functioning of a karst aquifer in an oceanic temperate climate with little anthropogenic pressure but strongly influenced by a high tidal range and second, to evaluate the extent and movements of a saltwater wedge influenced by both the tide and the natural recharge of the aquifer. Variations in specific conductivity combined with water chemistry results from six boreholes and two lakes located in the Bell Harbour catchment (western Ireland) enabled us to assess the extent of the intrusion of the saltwater wedge into the aquifer as a function of both karst recharge and tidal movements at high/low and neap/spring tidal cycles. The marked spatial disparity of the saltwater wedge was analysed as a function of both the hydrodynamic and the structural properties of the karst aquifer. Results showed that the extent of the saltwater wedge depended not only on the intrinsic properties of the aquifer but also on the relative influence of the recharge and the tide on groundwater levels, which have opposite effects. Recharge in the Burren area throughout the year is large enough to prevent saltwater intruding more than about one kilometre from the shore. A strong tidal amplitude seems to be the motor of sudden saltwater intrusion observed in the aquifer near the shore while the position of the groundwater level seems to influence the intensity of the salinity increase. Competition between recharge and the tide thus controls the seawater inputs, hence explaining temporal and spatial changes in the saltwater wedge in this coastal karst aquifer. (C) Elsevier B.V.

Annual pulses of copper-enriched sediment in a North American river downstream of a large lake following the catastrophic failure of a mine tailings storage facility	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Failures of mine tailings storage facilities (TSF) can have profound and long-lasting effects on the downstream receiv-ing environment. Virtually all spills to date have been into river systems without large lakes that may buffer down-stream impacts. In August 2014, the failure of the Mount Polley copper (Cu)-gold mine TSF in British Columbia, Canada, released-25 x 106 m3 of water and solids; globally, this is the second largest TSF spill in history. Over 18 x 106 m3 was delivered to Quesnel Lake, which is-9 km from the TSF and is the third deepest lake in North America, and a crucial habitat for Pacific salmon and trout populations. We determined the sediment-associated Cu concentrations and fluxes in Quesnel River, downstream of the lake, from August 2014 to February 2021 based on the analysis of >400 samples of sediment, mainly collected using a continuous -flow centrifuge. During each winter since the spill, Cu concentrations in the fluvial sediment in the upper reaches of the river (-35 km from the TSF) were elevated relative to regional background concentrations and samples collected before the spill. Maximum Cu concentrations were-410 mg kg-1 which exceeds Canadian sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic organisms (197 mg kg-1). Monitoring of Quesnel Lake since the spill shows that these annual pulses in the winter are due to resuspension of unconsolidated tailings and sediments at the bottom of Quesnel Lake, during autumnal lake turnover, which become mixed throughout the water column and subsequently flow into Quesnel River. Results show that while large lakes may buffer downstream aquatic systems from contaminated sediment, they may prolong the environmental impact. These findings are crucial in understanding how lake processes may modify the effects of TSF spills on downstream aquatic systems.					; Laval, Bernard/J-9861-2012	Albers, Sam/0000-0002-9270-7884; Owens, Philip/0000-0001-8924-7437													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	2023	856		1						158927	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158927	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158927		SEP 2022						36152844					WOS:000871095200008
J	Takasu, H; Tani, Y; Nakano, SI				Takasu, Hiroyuki; Tani, Yukinori; Nakano, Shin-ichi			Growth and grazing mortality of Synechococcus during its summer bloom in a brackish hypertrophic lake (Lake Sanaru, Japan)	LIMNOLOGY												In the picoplankton class, the cyanobacterial genus Synechococcus is ubiquitously distributed across a wide range of trophic states in aquatic ecosystems. Most Synechococcus species are grazed on by protists such as heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates. Although HNF is typically the main grazer of Synechococcus, few studies have investigated HNF grazing of Synechococcus in hypertrophic lakes. To evaluate the importance of Synechococcus biomass within the microbial food web, the current study was performed in the hypertrophic Lake Sanaru, where we determined the growth and grazing mortality of Synechococcus during a summer bloom using a dilution method. The abundance of Synechococcus was higher (1.2-8.5 x 106 cells mL-1) than in previous studies. Daily growth and grazing mortality rates suggested that a significant fraction (170-916 mu g C L-1 d-1, 53-175%) of Synechococcus production was lost to HNF grazing in this lake. Synechococcus grew actively and grazed during the daytime and did not show marked growth or grazing mortality during the nighttime. Our findings reinforce the view that Synechococcus is an important food item for HNF in a wide trophic range of lakes, ranging from oligotrophic to hypertrophic. This is the first report of diel variations in the growth and grazing mortality of Synechococcus in a hypertrophic lake.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2025	26	2					263	269		10.1007/s10201-025-00783-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-025-00783-y		JAN 2025											WOS:001407528100001

The aim of this study was to investigate possible management actions to control eutrophication and assure water use of a eutrophic deep Mediterranean climate reservoir, dominated by cyanobacteria. With this goal, we defined the trophic state of Lake Cedrino (Sardinia, Italy) and studied its phytoplankton, paying particular attention to cyanobacteria, and to seasonal variation of phytoplankton in relation to seasonal variation of environmental variables. The water samples were collected monthly from September 2010 to August 2011 at differing depths from the surface of the water to the bottom at a station located in the deeper portion of the reservoir. Physical, chemical, nutrient, qualitative and quantitative analyses of phytoplankton were performed, and the trophic state was evaluated based on the Trophic State Index and the OECD model. Abundance of nutrients and phytoplankton (cell density, biomass and chlorophyll a) indicated a eutrophic condition of the reservoir. In summer, phytoplankton species composition was dominated by nuisance cyanobacteria, particularly Aphanizomenon flosaquae, thereby requiring management plans for harmful blooms. On the base of lake features, we propose management actions at different scales and levels to resolve eutrophication and to allow water use: from nutrient load reduction in the watershed (primarily from point-sources) to deep water aeration, to immediately face an attenuation of eutrophic effects. This study is the first explorative step in planning restoration of Lake Cedrino. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Schulze, J; Gehrmann, S; Somvanshi, A; Rudolph-Cleff, A				Schulze, Joachim; Gehrmann, Simon; Somvanshi, Avikal; Rudolph-Cleff, Annette			From District to City Scale: The Potential of Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD)	WATER												The summer of 2022 was one of the hottest and driest summers that Germany experienced in the 21st century. Water levels in rivers sank dramatically with many dams and reservoirs running dry; as a result, fields could not be irrigated sufficiently, and even power generation and supply were affected. The impact of abnormally high temperatures for extended periods (heatwaves) is not restricted to nature and the economy but is also a considerable public health burden. Experts worldwide agree that these extreme weather events are being driven by climate change and will increase in intensity and frequency in the future. The adverse impact of these extreme weather events multiplies among dense urban environments, e.g., through heat islands. This calls for cities to take action to heat-proof and water-secure their urban developments. Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) is one such approach to mitigate the aforementioned challenges by leveraging the urban water ecosystem with special attention to the subject of water reclamation, retention, treatment and distribution. This paper introduces and builds upon a prototype of WSUD that centers around an artificial lake as an integrated water resource management system (IWRMS) fed by treated grey water and storm water obtained from two housing blocks flanking the water reservoir. Based on the specifications of this prototype, indicators of site suitability are derived and applied to identify potential locations for replicable projects in the city of Darmstadt. The results confirm the impact WSUD can have: a total of 22 sites with 2527 apartments are found suitable for prototype implementation in Darmstadt. Savings in town water consumption from these 22 sites would add up to 147 million liters. Further benefits include the provision of 24 million liters of irrigation water, storm water retention, adiabatic cooling during heatwave, increased biodiversity and the improvement in livability of the sites and the city.

J	Lee, DK; Cha, DH				Lee, Dong-Kyou; Cha, Dong-Hyun			Regional climate modeling for Asia	GEOSCIENCE LETTERS												The regional climate model (RCM) with higher resolution and sophisticated physical processes can reproduce and project fine-scale climate information, which cannot be captured by the global climate model (GCM). Therefore, we developed the Seoul National University Regional Climate Model (SNURCM) in the 1990s to simulate the intrinsic and detailed climate prevailing in Asia. In this study, we reviewed the developmental processes of the SNURCM and its application researches. In the simulation of regional climate over Asia, systematic errors can be generated because of natural characteristics such as complex land-surface conditions and topography, warm ocean conditions, and strong seasonal monsoon circulation and convection. Numerous methods and techniques have been applied to reduce these errors and improve the SNURCM. For long-term simulations without climate drift, the spectral nudging technique as well as the traditional relaxation method was employed for the boundary conditions. To represent reasonable interactions between earth systems, a simple ocean model and an advanced land-surface model were implemented into the SNURCM. Physical schemes for precipitation and vertical diffusion developed for short-term numerical weather prediction models were optimized or improved for long-term simulation. The SNURCM has been applied to future climate projection, reproduction of extreme climate, and seasonal forecasting. Furthermore, the model has served as a part of the multi-model comparison program and an ensemble of international research programs.

J	Jones, MD; Richter, T				Jones, Matthew D.; Richter, Tobias			Paleoclimatic and archeological implications of Pleistocene and Holocene environments in Azraq, Jordan	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Wetlands are a key archive for paleoclimatic and archeological work, particularly in arid regions, as they provide a focus for human occupation and preserve environmental information. The sedimentary record from 'Ayn Qasiyya, a spring site on the edge of the Azraq Qa, provides a well-dated sequence through the last glacial-interglacial transition (LGIT) allowing environmental changes in the present-day Jordanian desert to be investigated robustly through this time period for the first time. Results show that the wettest period at the site preceded the last glacial maximum, which itself was characterised by marsh formation and a significant Early Epipaleolithic occupation. A sedimentary hiatus between 16 and 10.5 ka suggests a period of drought in the region although seasonal rains and surface waters still allowed seasonal occupation of the Azraq region. Archeological evidence suggests that conditions had improved by the Late Epipaleolithic, about the time of the North Atlantic Younger Dryas. The changes between wet and dry conditions at the site show similarities to patterns in the eastern Mediterranean and in Arabia suggesting the Jordan interior was influenced by changes in both these regions through the LGIT climatic transition.

Zooplankton Study of Lake Sevan as an Indicator of Ecosystem Stability in the Context of Global Climate Change	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												We have studied the state of the zooplankton community of Lake Sevan in present-day climatic conditions at a relatively stable water level. The taxonomic composition is poor but retains features that were characteristic of this lake even before the beginning of the artificial lowering of the water level (1938) for energy and irrigation purposes. The lake is mesotrophic in zooplankton development indicators, but in some years a low transparency and high values of zooplankton biomass are observed, which is characteristic of eutrophic reservoirs. This is a consequence of an increase in water level and aY possible increase in water temperature under climate change.

S	Ford, D		Slaymaker, O		Ford, Derek			Little Limestone Lake: A Beautiful Marl Lake in the Interlake Region, Manitoba	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF WESTERN CANADA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											Marl lakes are those accumulating fine-grained bottom sediments including at least 25 % CaCO3. Visually attractive examples have higher proportions of CaCO3, with crystallites precipitating in the water to give it a rich and opaque duck-egg blue colouration. Such lakes are largely limited to recently glaciated carbonate rock terrains. Most are also shallow, with much or all of the water column being in the photic zone. Little Limestone Lake (lat. 53 degrees 47' N, long. 99 degrees 19'W) is the finest example that the author has seen. It occupies a shallow glacial trough scoured in a plain of flat-lying cyclothem dolomites. It is similar to 12 km long, 1-5 km wide, and rarely >7 m deep. Including bordering wetlands, it occupies similar to 45 % of the area of an elongated, narrow topographic basin. Recharge is through impoverished boreal forest with little soil cover; it discharges chiefly as springs and seeps along and below the shore. Mean annual temperature is similar to 1 degrees C, and precipitation is similar to 475 mm/year. Springs in the surrounding region show groundwaters to be simple bicarbonate composition, with TDS = 230-300 mg/L. Grab sampling throughout the lake found its waters degassed to 125-135 mg/L. Little Limestone Lake is visually spectacular because it is almost entirely groundwater fed, with a ratio of recharge area to lake area that is low. In contrast, nearby lakes are regularly flushed by channelled surface storm water and thus cannot maintain high densities of crystallites in suspension. The lake became protected as a provincial park in June 2011.																			2213-2090	2213-2104	978-3-319-44595-3; 978-3-319-44593-9				2017							123	129		10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3_8	10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3												WOS:000415340100010

Whole-ecosystem oxygenation experiments reveal substantially greater hypolimnetic methane concentrations in reservoirs during anoxia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Lakes and reservoirs globally produce large quantities of methane and carbon dioxide in their sediments, which accumulate in the hypolimnia (bottom waters) during thermally stratified conditions. A key parameter controlling hypolimnetic greenhouse gas concentrations is dissolved oxygen. Land use and climate change have increased hypolimnetic anoxia worldwide in lakes and reservoirs, which is expected to affect their methane and carbon dioxide concentrations. We conducted whole-ecosystem oxygenation experiments to assess the effects of oxygen concentrations on dissolved hypolimnetic greenhouse gas concentrations in comparison to a reference reservoir and calculated the maximum hypolimnetic global warming potential in both reservoirs over three summers. We observed significantly greater hypolimnetic methane under anoxic conditions but similar carbon dioxide concentrations, leading to greater hypolimnetic global warming potential of anoxic hypolimnia. Our study indicates that the global warming potential of hypolimnetic greenhouse gas concentrations may increase as the prevalence of hypolimnetic anoxia increases due to global change.

The 1.5-ka varved record of Lake Montcortes (southern Pyrenees, NE Spain)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The karstic Lake Montcortes sedimentary sequence spanning the last 1548 yr constitutes the first continuous, high-resolution, multi-proxy varved record in northern Spain. Sediments consist of biogenic varves composed of calcite, organic matter and detrital laminae and turbidite layers. Calcite layer thickness and internal sub-layering indicate changes in water temperature and seasonality whereas the frequency of detrital layers reflects rainfall variability. Higher temperatures occurred in Lake Montcortes in AD 555-738, 825-875, 1010-1322 and 1874-present. Lower temperatures and prolonged winter conditions were recorded in AD 1446-1598, 1663-1711 and 1759-1819. Extreme and multiple precipitation events dominated in AD 571-593, 848-922, 987-1086, 1168-1196, 1217-1249, 1444-1457, 1728-1741 and 1840-1875, indicating complex hydrological variability in NE Spain since AD 463. The sedimentary record of Lake Montcortes reveals a short-term relation between rainfall variability and the detrital influx, pronounced during extended periods of reduced anthropogenic influences. In pre-industrial times, during warm climate episodes, population and land use increased in the area. After the onset of the industrialization, the relationship between climate and human activities decoupled and population dynamics and landscape modifications were therefore mostly determined by socio-economic factors.

The fish of the year-class grew slowly: after thr first summer, the mean wet body mass of 2.0 g was reached and after the third summer 6.9 g. The year-class 1991 dominated the vendace population until 1994. Juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) were stocked annually to the lake (6 fish per hectare in 1991-1994). In 1991, the brown trout fed predominantly on vendace and the average wet body mass of vendace in the stomachs was 1.2 g. In 1992, 1993, and 1994 proportion of vendace in the diet decreased as the mean wet body mass of vendace increased. While the annual proportion of vendace in the diet decreased, the proportion of nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) in the diet of brown trout increased. The mean wet body mass of nine-spined stickleback in the stomachs was 0.2-0.4 g in 1991-1994. The diet shift from vendace to nine-spined stickleback was consequently affected by the increase in the mean size of vendace of the year-class 1991 and by the lack of strong vendace year-classes in 1992-1994. The diet shift decreased the growth rate of brown trout in 1993. In spite of the predation pressure by brown trout, the year-class 1991 of vendace resulted in a total catch of 15 kg per hectare, predominantly in 1993. This indicates that the growth pattern of vendace population was not predator-induced, suggesting a 'bottom-up' control between the trophic levels.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						295	303																WOS:000078180200029

Chironomid dataset from Mutterbergersee: A late-Holocene paleotemperature proxy record for the Central Eastern Alps, Austria	DATA IN BRIEF												We present a dataset of subfossil chironomid assemblages in the MUT-10 sediment core obtained from the high alpine lake Mutterbergersee in the Austrian Alps in 2010. The data were presented in the research article by Ilyashuk et al. (2019) "The Little Ice Age signature in a 700-year high -resolution chironomid record of summer temperatures in the Central Eastern Alps". In addition to the results of the chi-ronomid analysis of 100 sediment samples presented in this article, we also include chironomid assemblage data from an additional 48 sediment samples that complement this dataset. The data includes raw chironomid counts, percent abundance of chironomid taxa, as well as mean July air tem-perature estimates derived from the chironomid record based on a chironomid-temperature transfer function. We also pro-vide information on age-dating of the sedimentary sequence. Given the high temporal resolution and the robust age-depth model of the record, the chironomid-based reconstruction of temperature since AD 1300 provides a detailed documenta-tion of climate change in the Eastern Alps from the Little Ice Age onwards and can be used for comparison with other in-dependent proxy-based climate reconstructions. In addition to the data, we detail the sample processing for subfossil chironomid analysis and provide a detailed description of the reconstruction technique used for producing chironomid-based quantitative temperature inferences.

In L. Manapouri, seasonal changes in both major element and trace metal concentrations were negligible and almost within the precision of analytical methods, indicating a highly uniform water composition. Major element concentrations were extremely low by global standards, in most cases below the 1% percentile level for global fresh waters. By contrast, the much shallower L. Hayes exhibited much higher major element concentrations, close to the global mean. In addition, this lake showed a clear anoxic sub-surface layer during summer, in which concentrations of the redox-active metals Fe and Mn became very high. Evidence of surface water utilisation of reactive Si, and deeper water scavenging of Cu, were both found in this lake.

The abundance of planktonic viruses and data suggesting substantial production potential (relative to bacterial secondary and photosynthetic primary production) indicate that viral lysis may be a major factor in the regulation of microbial populations in these extreme environments. Furthermore, we suggest that Antarctic lakes may be a reservoir of previously undescribed viruses that possess novel biological and biochemical characteristics.					; suttle, c/N-1144-2019	Suttle, Curtis/0000-0002-0372-0033; 													0024-3590					NOV	1998	43	7					1754	1761		10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1754	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1754								11543124					WOS:000077285000035
J	ELSER, JJ; GEORGE, NB				ELSER, JJ; GEORGE, NB			THE STOICHIOMETRY OF N AND P IN THE PELAGIC ZONE OF CASTLE LAKE, CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We measured the concentrations, as well as lake-wide amounts, of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in dissolved, seston and zooplankton pools throughout the water column of Castle Lake, California, during summer, 1991. This allowed us to determine the stoichiometric ratios of important elements in each pool (C:N, C:P, N:P) as well as for the entire lake. Dissolved and seston pools were the predominant storage compartments for both N and P; zooplankton never contained >5% of N or 10% of P lake wide. However, by late summer, the concentrations of P in seston and in zooplankton were similar in the upper portions of the water column, suggesting that changes in food web structure that alter zooplankton biomass and community composition (and hence elemental storage in the zooplankton) may produce significant shifts in nutrient storage among pelagic pools. Lake-wide levels of dissolved N were largely constant over the study period; however, lake-wide dissolved P increased. These dynamics suggested that the Majority of nutrients stored in dissolved pools were unavailable for phytoplankton growth. N:P and C:P ratios indicated that Castle Lake phytoplankton became severely deficient in P during the course of our observations. These ratios also greatly exceeded recently reported threshold values for elemental constraints on growth and reproduction for several species of zooplankton. The ratio of N to P in the zooplankton pool was relatively constant and consistently lower than that in the sestion. As a result, the predicted N:P ratio of zooplankton-regenerated nutrients exceeded the N:P ratio of the seston, implying that zooplankton nutrient regeneration further skewed N and P supply ratios, and potentially enhanced P limitation of phytoplankton in Castle Lake.

During the winter period 1981/82 the species composition of the phytoplankton changed. New species replaced those observed in previous years. We conclude that the combined effect of these three lake restoration measures was responsible for the sudden disappearance of Oscillatoria rubescens D.C.

J	Nease, P; Höök, TO				Nease, Patricia; Hook, Tomas O.			Local resource reliance of juvenile fish in small lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Juvenile stages of fishes are frequently bottlenecks to recruitment. Habitat use of early life stages and the extent to which fish rely on local resources may affect how they respond to habitat loss and alterations, with important implications for habitat management. To investigate the potential for prolonged reliance on local resources, we quantified stable isotope ratios (delta(13) carbon, delta(15) nitrogen, delta(18) oxygen and delta(2) hydrogen) of young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and isotope ratios of locally collected water and potential prey across three study components, a controlled pond experiment, a multi-lake survey and a detailed single-lake survey. Across study components, we observed habitat and site fidelity of YOY largemouth bass in mid-summer, demonstrated by distinct spatial differences in young bass stable isotope ratios. Additionally, we observed significant, positive correlations between delta C-13 of YOY largemouth bass and delta C-13 of locally collected invertebrates and small bluegill Lepomis macrochirus in the single lake survey, suggesting localised foraging. Later in summer, spatial differences in largemouth bass stable isotope ratios were not apparent, indicating a transition to more spatially integrated foraging. Prior to switch to piscivory, YOY largemouth bass rely on local resources indicating that they may be more susceptible, both positively and negatively, to hyper-local changes in forage availability or disturbances. This study demonstrates that stable isotope ratios allow for differentiating environmental experiences among young fish in relatively close proximity in small freshwater systems. Moreover, high spatial variation of consumer stable isotope ratios demonstrates the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity in stable isotope studies.

The ecosystems of shallow lakes are especially vulnerable to these changes. Traditional monitoring via microscopy is not able to quantify the dynamics of toxin-producing cyanobacteria on a proper spatio-temporal scale. Molecular tools are highly sensitive and can be useful as an early warning tool for lake managers. We quantified the potential microcystin (MC) producers in Lake Peipsi using microscopy and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and analysed the relationship between the abundance of the mcyE genes, MC concentration, MC variants and toxin quota per mcyE gene. We also linked environmental factors to the cyanobacteria community composition. In Lake Peipsi, we found rather moderate MC concentrations, but microcystins and microcystin-producing cyanobacteria were widespread across the lake. Nitrate (NO3-) was a main driver behind the cyanobacterial community at the beginning of the growing season, while in late summer it was primarily associated with the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration. A positive relationship was found between the MC quota per mcyE gene and water temperature. The most abundant variant-MC-RR-was associated with MC quota per mcyE gene, while other MC variants did not show any significant impact.

However, little is known about the seasonal dynamics of the bacterial communities inhabiting these lakes and the role of environmental factors that have the main impact on their structure. Therefore, two soda pans were sampled monthly between April 2013 and July 2014 to reveal changes in the planktonic community. By late spring in both years, a sudden shift in the community structure was observed, the previous algae-associated bacterial communities had collapsed, resulting the highest ratio of Actinobacteria within the bacterioplankton (89%, with the dominance of acIII-A1 lineage) ever reported in the literature. Before these peaks, an extremely high abundance (>10,000 individuum l(-1)) of microcrustaceans (Moina brachiata and Arctodiaptomus spinosus) was observed. OTU-based statistical approaches showed that in addition to algal blooms and water-level fluctuations, zooplankton densities had the strongest effect on the composition of bacterial communities. In these extreme environments, this implies a surprisingly strong, community-shaping top-down role of microcrustacean grazers.

(ZINGIBERACEAE) AND ACORUS-CALAMUS L (ARACEAE) UNDER HYPOXIA AND ANOXIA	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Rhizomes of wetland plants are subjected to periods of hypoxia and/or anoxia by the seasonal or permanent waterlogging of their growing sites. Hedychium coronarium, the White Ginger, and Acorus calamus, the Sweet Flag, have their origin in India and were introduced into Latin America and Europe, respectively, more than three centuries ago. The White Ginger grows in humus-rich, shaded or semi-shaded areas subjected to waterlogging but it is never totally submersed, while the Sweet Flag grows at lake margins and is totally submersed during winter. 2. Winter rhizomes of both species were cultivated in water culture in a greenhouse. The end products of fermentation (ethanol, lactic acid, malic acid), overall rhizome pH, the adenylate pool of nucleotides, the energy charge and their capacity to resume growth, were measured after periods of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 days of anoxia and hypoxia. In all cases metabolic responses were also determined in rhizomes allowed to recover for 24 h in air. 3. Ethanol was the main fermentation end product in both species, reaching higher concentrations in the anoxia-treated rhizomes. In H. coronarium, there was also a significant increase in the levels of lactic acid, with a considerable drop in overall rhizome pH. 4. Anoxia and hypoxia induced, in both species, a significant drop in the energy charge values. Control plant rhizomes and rhizomes allowed to recover in air for 24 h had energy charge values of around 0.8. In rhizomes subjected to stress these values were lower, around 0.50 in A. calamus and as low as 0.3 in H. coronarium. 5. Although in both species there is also a decrease in the amount of total nucleotides, it was much more drastic in the case of anoxia treated rhizomes of H. coronarium. The pH drop was most probably the underlying cause of the metabolic disarray that lead to a depletion of the adenylate pool and, finally, failure to regenerate after 16-days of anoxia. 6. The results also show that energy charge values without measurements of the total adenylate pool may give a misleading impression of fitness. Thus, the anaerobic metabolism of H. coronarium is less efficient and more harmful than that of A. calamus and, although considerably tolerant to hypoxia, it does not tolerate strict anoxia as the latter species does.

Occurrence of microcystins in 33 US water supplies	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												Microcystin levels in 33 lake and reservoir raw water sources were monitored biweekly during summer 2003. Hydrophobic C-18 chromatography was used for sample concentration and microcystin purification. Total toxin levels were expressed as microcystin-LR equivalent concentrations using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed that microcystins were detectable in most raw water samples, but concentrations exceeded 1 mu g/L in only 14 of 206 samples (7%). Stagnant water conditions were associated with the two raw water sources in which average toxin levels exceeded 1 mu g/L. When aggregate results were considered, plant effluent samples showed toxin levels nearly 10-fold lower, suggesting that existing water treatment processes were effective for toxin removal.																			0003-150X					SEP	2007	99	9					118	125																WOS:000249547700025

The influence of these changes on the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton communities in the YRE are still inadequately un-derstood. We studied the spatial distribution of environmental factors, zooplankton abundance and biomass, and phytoplankton abundance and community in the YRE at different WSRS stages during 2018 (WSRS year) and compared with corresponding durations in 2017 (non-WSRS year). Our results demonstrate that the WSRS (1) promoted phytoplankton growth in estuarine areas at the pre-stage and decreased phytoplankton abundances in the entire study area during the inter-stage, (2) decreased phytoplankton biodiversity and increased abundance and proportion of Synedra sp., and (3) led to a temporary rapid increase in zooplankton abundance and biomass. Bottom-up effects dominated phytoplankton variability at the pre-and end-stages of the WSRS, while top-down effects dominated the inter-stage. Redundancy analysis indicated that phytoplankton assemblages were primarily influ-enced by nitrate and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus at the pre-stage, by zooplankton abundance and biomass at the inter-stage, and by ammonium and dissolved silica at the end-stage. Our findings provide essential information for understanding and predicting the changes in the phytoplankton community due to increases in hydrodynamics, nutrients, and turbidity conditions in river estuaries. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of water temperature on the zooplankton was estimated using the Spearman rank correlation. Over the whole study period, the zooplankton in both water bodies exhibited a high species richness and a wide species diversity (expressed as the Pielou index) but a relatively low abundance and biomass. No significant relation was found between water temperature and the total abundance, biomass and diversity indices of zooplankton. On the other hand, there were significant relations between water temperature and the abundance and biomass of individual taxonomic groups.																			1644-0765						2006	5	2					111	120																WOS:000421184100011

The sample was subjected to microscopic examination and bulk, elemental, isotopic, black carbon, and molecular (lignin, lipid) analyses. The bulk elemental composition and organic carbon (OC) content (1.02% dry weight) establishes the dust's origin as continental upper crust and is typical of dusts that emanate from West Africa. These data are in accord with the extensive satellite imagery documenting the transit of dust clouds from the Sahara and Sahel regions (e. g., NASA TOMS aerosol index). Microscopic examination reveals that charcoal-like particles from vegetation fires ("black carbon'' (BC)) are the most abundant morphologically distinct organic components. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 analysis yields conventional C-14 ages for bulk OC of 1260 +/- 40 years and BC of 2070 +/- 35 years. Taken together with corresponding stable carbon isotopic compositions (delta(13)C, -18.9 and -15.1parts per thousand, respectively), these results suggest the presence of biomass and burning residues derived from predominantly C-4 vegetation that accumulated in soils over the late Holocene. Molecular-level measurements are also consistent with this scenario. For example, lignin-derived phenols in the dustfall sample indicate a significant contribution of angiosperm grass-type tissue. The altered nature of the lignin suggests storage as residues in soils. Solvent extractable (lipid) constituents include a marked leaf wax type component with a molecular and stable carbon isotopic composition similar to those observed in surface marine sediments in this region. The hydrocarbon fraction contained some diesel-type contamination but the n-alkanes (C-23-C-33) retained a prominent odd/even distribution, with delta(13)C ranging from -26.7 to 28.5parts per thousand. The suite of even carbon numbered n-alkanols (C-22-C-32) is C-14 dated at 647 +/- 150 years, with delta(13)C values ranging from 23.9 to 30.4parts per thousand. The long-chain n-alkanoic acids (C-22-C-32) exhibited delta(13)C values ranging from 22.6 to 27.4parts per thousand. These waxes are evidently a mixed signal derived from contemporary C-3 and C-4 vegetation and from ablated soils and desiccated lake sediments of middle to late Holocene age. This molecular approach shows promise as a tool for continental paleoenvironmental assessment, particularly with respect to past vegetation cover, regional aridity, and wind systems.

Berry			Hydrological Connectivity of the Landscape of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	GEOGRAPHY COMPASS												The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica are composed of nearly 2000 km 2 of ice-free terrain, supporting a vibrant cold desert ecosystem despite harsh conditions. The ecosystem is largely regulated by the hydrologic cycle within the MDV, which is controlled by climate dynamics. The strength and timing of connections among the hydrologic reservoirs of the MDV (atmosphere, glaciers, soils and permafrost, streams and their hyporheic zones, and lakes) are dependent upon daily, seasonal, and annual surface energy balance. For example, glacier melt occurs during short periods in the summer, providing stream flow to closed-basin lakes. Similarly, the magnitude of sublimation of snow on valley floors and perennial ice covers on lakes is a function of wind, temperature, radiation, and atmospheric water content (humidity). Here, we describe these reservoirs and connections across the landscape to provide an overview of our current understanding of the system, as it is poised to change in response to changing climate in the coming decades. Measurement of hydrologic fluxes and states of hydrologic reservoirs in the MDV provides both a context for quantifying responses to climate change and a careful characterization of the potential direct drivers of ecosystem response. The MDV also provide a unique real-world laboratory in which to study fundamental hydrologic processes (with the exception of rainfall).

Resuspension altered the nutrient and light climate of nearshore waters; light attenuation (K-d) and phosphorus concentrations corresponded (p less than or equal to 0.0001 and p less than or equal to 0.001, respectively) with concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM). Phytoplankton cell volume and diatom cell abundance and volume were not associated with SPM concentrations (p > 0.05). Diatom composition displayed spatial dissimilarities corresponding with resuspension (p less than or equal to 0.001); small centric diatoms exhibiting meroplanktonic life histories and pennate diatoms considered benthic in origin were most abundant within SPM-impacted, nearshore waters whereas taxa typically comprising assemblages in optically-clear, offshore waters and the basin- wide, spring bloom were not. Values of P-max(B) and alpha(B) corresponded (p less than or equal to 0.0001) with both K-d coefficients and SPM concentrations, potentially reflecting increased light harvesting/utilization within impacted assemblages. However, integral production was inversely associated with K-d coefficients and SPM concentrations (p < 0.0001) and photosynthesis was light- limited (or nearly so) for most assemblages. Although mu(Chl) values corresponded with K-d coefficients (p <= 0.05), values were quite low (<(x)over bar> +/- S. E., 0.10 +/- 0.004 d(-1)) throughout the study. Most likely, distinct rate processes between SPM- and non-impacted assemblages reflected short-term compositional (and corresponding physiological) variations due to infusion of meroplankton and/or tributary-derived phytoplankton. Overall, resuspension appears to have little, if any, long-term impact upon the structure and function of the lake's phytoplankton.

Altogether 186 species are recorded, some of which were found only as larvae and subsequently reared. Four species were found that are probably new to science. Many rare or little known species were also found, such as Xanthorhoe frigida and Aletia sollennis. Distributions of the species beyond The Remarkables, some notable absences and the ecology/biology of some species are noted and discussed. New host plant records are recorded for some species. Coleoptera, Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Plecoptera and Neuroptera collected in the area are also recorded. The Rastus Burn Basin is part of a proposed scenic reserve on The Remarkables to protect both biological and landscape values of the mountain range. Another large area of the Rastus Burn Basin is classified as a recreation reserve to accommodate a skifield operation there. Conservation values are high in the study area, and as a result human impacts associated with both the skifield operation and increased summer recreation have been kept to a minimum. This survey documents not only species diversity but also benchmark species populations of the reserve.

The results showed that concentrations of LAS ranged from 18.6 to 260.1 mu g L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), and the average concentration was 52.6 mu g L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) in Lake Dianchi. The highest concentrations of LAS were found in the Northwest region, and the distribution of LAS varied through seasons, with much lower concentrations in fall than in any other seasons. LAS can be primarily biodegraded by microorganisms in the lake water, and the percentage of degradation was > 97% after 28 days. Biodegradation of LAS was well-fitted with the kinetic model presented in this paper, and the half-lives ranged from 3.2 to 16.3 days. Temperature, pH, and initial concentrations could affect the biodegradation of LAS, among which temperature was the major factor influencing on biodegradation of LAS in water of Lake Dianchi.

Seasonal variability in the dynamics of marine-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Recent studies indicate that the dynamics of fast-flowing, marine-terminating outlet glaciers of the Greenland ice sheet may be sensitive to climate and ocean forcing on sub-annual timescales. Observations of seasonal behavior of these glaciers at such high temporal resolution, however, are currently few. Here we present observations of front position, flow speed, near-surface air temperature and ocean conditions for six large marine-terminating glaciers in the Uummannaq region of West Greenland, to investigate controls on short-term glacier dynamics. As proposed by other studies, we find that seasonal front advance and retreat correlates with the formation and disappearance of an ice melange. Our data suggest that high sea-surface temperature, anomalously low sea-ice concentration and reduced melange formation in early 2003 have triggered multi-year retreat of several glaciers in the study area, which is consistent with other regions in Greenland. Of the stable glaciers, only Rink Isbrae exhibits a seasonal speed variation that correlates with variations in front position, with the others undergoing mid-summer deceleration that indicates the effects of subglacial meltwater discharge and drainage system evolution. Drainage of supraglacial lakes and water-filled crevasses results in substantial decreases in speed (40-60%) on fast-flowing glaciers. Our results demonstrate that attempts to model ice-sheet evolution must take into account short-timescale flow dynamics resulting from drainage events and oceanographic conditions.					; Box, Jason/AAE-1654-2019; Howat, Ian/A-3474-2008	Herrington, Adam/0000-0002-8273-5507; Enderlin, Ellyn/0000-0002-8266-7719; Box, Jason/0000-0003-0052-8705; Howat, Ian/0000-0002-8072-6260; Ahn, Yushin/0000-0002-5305-6396													0022-1430	1727-5652					2010	56	198					601	613		10.3189/002214310793146232	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/002214310793146232													WOS:000283027700004

Fuji Holocene eruption history reconstructed from proximal lake sediments and high-density radiocarbon dating	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												An 8000-year lacustrine sediment record from Lake Motosu (Fuji Five Lakes) records several eruptions, including potentially unreported events, of the active Mt. Fuji volcano, which receives approximately 47 million annual visitors. A high-fidelity age model is constructed from tephra ages and high-density radiocarbon dating of terrestrial macrofossil and bulk organic matter. Variability in lake reservoir age is constrained by modern lake water radiocarbon measurement and reverse calibration of tephra calendar ages. We present more accurate ages for known eruptions, detect a wider distribution of ejecta for several eruptions, including the most recent summit eruption, and potentially identify previously undetected flank eruptions. There are closely spaced scoria-fall layers that may be difficult to differentiate as separate events in land-based surveys. These results demonstrate the utility of lacustrine sediments as powerful tools for understanding characteristics of volcanic eruptions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Modelling of climate-induced hydrologic changes in the Lake Winnipeg watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The hydrologic regime of the Lake Winnipeg watershed (LWW), Canada, is dominated by spring snowmelt runoff, often occurring over frozen ground. Analyses of regional climate models (RCMs) based on future climate projections presented in a companion paper of this special issue (Dibike et al., 2012) show future increases in annual precipitation and temperature in various seasons and regions of this catchment. Such changes are expected to influence the volume of snow accumulation and melt, as well as the timing and intensity of runoff. This paper presents results of modelling climate-induced hydrologic changes in two representative sub-catchments of the Red and Assiniboine basins in the LWW. The hydrologic model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was employed to simulate a 21-year baseline (1980-2000) and future (2042-2062) climate based on climate forcings derived from 3 RCMs. The effects of future changes in climatic variables, specifically precipitation and temperature, are clearly evident in the resulting snowmelt and runoff regimes. The most significant changes include higher total runoff, and earlier snowmelt and discharge peaks. Some of the results also revealed increases in peak discharge intensities. Such changes will have significant implications for water availability and nutrient transport regimes in the LWW.

This corridor includes the two major metropolitan areas of Toronto and Montreal and experiences more exceedences of the Canadian ozone guideline per year than any other part of the country. The overall objective of SONTOS is to elucidate the factors which lead to these high levels, The study design is based on intensive measurements made at a site to the NNW of Toronto, with supplementary measurements at other sites and on board an aircraft. This paper, and the seven which follow, describe and interpret the measurements made in the summer of 1992. Although this summer was noteworthy for generally very low ozone concentrations, a number of interesting observations have been made which have a bearing on the oxidant phenomenon in southern Ontario. In particular, this paper describes two specific events. In one, which occurred on 6 August 1992, the intensive measurement site experienced the impact of a polluted air mass, which had apparently travelled to the site from Toronto, by way of Lake Ontario. This case has been contrasted with an event in the last week of August, in which large-scale, organised southwesterly flow led to the conditions which more typically give rise to widespread ozone episodes in the province. Events similar to the 6 August episode occurred on several occasions during the study period, and underline the very important role of the Great Lakes in ozone transport and delivery in southern Ontario.

The model is of patch type and is derived with the aid of reaction-advection equations for the migratory birds in the air along the flyways. Poultry may reside at some or all of the four patches of the model, which consist of the breeding patch for the migratory birds, their winter feeding patch, and two stopover patches where birds rest and refuel on their migration. Outward and return migratory routes can be different. The equations for the migratory birds contain time delays which represent the flight times for migratory birds along particular sectors. Delays also appear in the model coefficients via quantities which represent flight survival probabilities for the various sectors. We establish results on positivity, boundedness, global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium, and the persistence of infection. We also discuss extensions of the model to include the seasonality of the migration phenomenon. Numerical simulations support the analytical findings; here we used data on H5N1 infected ducks in the Poyang Lake region of China.

It has numerous ecological, economic and social implications in terms of biodiversity, climate, species, habitat, tourism and recreation. However, during the past decade, the lake has shrunk significantly and its depth has fallen by almost 6m. Contrary to other studies that have focused on the geomorphology of the lake, this study analyses the socio-environmental impact and provides a sustainable adaptive governance management model for its revival. This study reveals that unless various stakeholders and affected parties are actively involved in an implementable adaptive governance model, the fate of the lake will remain uncertain.

J	Scheff, J; Seager, R; Liu, HB; Coats, S				Scheff, Jacob; Seager, Richard; Liu, Haibo; Coats, Sloan			Are Glacials Dry? Consequences for Paleoclimatology and for Greenhouse Warming	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Past cold climates are often thought to have been drier than today on land, which appears to conflict with certain recent studies projecting widespread terrestrial drying with near-future warming. However, other work has found that, over large portions of the continents, the conclusion of future drying versus wetting strongly depends on the physical property of interest. Here, it is shown that this also holds in simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM): the continents have generally wetter topsoils and higher values of common climate wetness metrics than in the preindustrial, as well as generally lower precipitation and ubiquitously lower photosynthesis (likely driven by the low CO2), with streamflow responses falling in between. Using a large existing global pollen and plant fossil compilation, it is also confirmed that LGM grasslands and open woodlands grew at many sites of present-day forest, seasonal forests at many sites of present-day rain forest, and so forth (116-144 sites out of 302), while changes in the opposite sense were very few (9-17 sites out of 302) and spatially confined. These vegetation changes resemble the model photosynthesis responses but not the hydroclimate responses, while published lake-level changes resemble the latter but not the former. Thus, confidence in both the model hydrologic and photosynthesis projections is increased, and there is no significant conflict. Instead, paleo- and modern climate researchers must carefully define "wetting'' and "drying'' and, in particular, should not assume hydrologic drying on the basis of vegetation decline alone or assume vegetation stress on the basis of declines in hydroclimatic indicators.					; Scheff, Jacob/AFL-7110-2022; Seager, Richard/GLW-9200-2022	COATS, SLOAN/0000-0001-6741-613X; Scheff, Jacob/0000-0003-1294-3447; Seager, Richard/0000-0003-4772-9707													0894-8755	1520-0442				SEP	2017	30	17					6593	6609		10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0854.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0854.1													WOS:000407276600001

Total P concentrations in bulk precipitation were very similar throughout the year (4.95 mu mol . L(-1) in rain versus 4.93 mu mol . L(-1) in snow). Total P concentration was lower in throughfall than in bulk precipitation, and P in growing season bulk throughfall(1.79 mu mol . L(-1)) was greater than that in the dormant season (1.00 mu mol .

Geomorphological features in the Gavkhoni playa lake, SE Esfahan, Iran	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Common features on the sand flat are gypsiferous marl mounds, gypsum interlayers, thin efflorescent salt crust, puffy surface and tufa. The first four features suggest periodic flooding and desiccation. Bi-carbonate-rich springs probably built small tufa mounds. Hard porous surface pitted by small holes with a few centimeters wide and deep is remarkable morphology on the mud flat/saline mud flat. This results from flooding, desiccation and evaporation of capillary brines and rapid and differential rising of the sedimentary surface. Polygonal halite crusts, halite pressure ridges and efflorescent cauliflowers (popcorn) are common features on the salt pan. They suggest volume reduction caused by either thermal contraction or desiccation and pumping of subsurface brine and subsequent evaporation along the cracks between the polygons.																			0891-2556					JUN	2007	22	1					1	5		10.1007/BF03175840	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175840													WOS:000247161500001

Italy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The organism responsible for the former annual reddening of Lake Tovel in the Italian Alps (up to 1964) has been identified and studied in detail. Considerable confusion exists regarding the identity of this organism, and the detailed description by Baldi in 1941 is now believed to be based on more than one organism. Baldi's red and green forms appear to be two different organisms, both of which have now been isolated into unialgal culture and studied using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and sequencing of the large subunit of ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA). The organism has been found in three lakes in the area, but only in Lake Tovel have conditions allowed for reddening of the water during summer. The name of the organism believed to be the cause of the reddening, Glenodinium sanguineum Marchesoni, used in numerous publications, is an illegitimate homonym of G. sanguineum H. J. Carter, and the organism is described here as a new species, Tovellia sanguinea sp. nov., the seventh species of the newly described genus Tovellia. T. sanguinea is closely related to the other red-coloured species of Tovellia, Tovellia coronata ( previously known as Woloszynskia coronata) but differs in several morphological features, notably the chloroplast arrangement, and in LSU rDNA sequence divergence (11-12%). Cells preserved from Lake Tovel during a reddening phenomenon in 1938 have been re-examined by scanning electron microscopy and agree morphologically with the new isolates. Tovellia sanguinea is a species of oligotrophic or mesotrophic-oligotrophic cold-water lakes, in which the average summer temperature does not exceed 15 degrees C. It occurs on both calcareous ( as in Lake Tovel) and non-calcareous substrata (as in the other two lakes).

In general, atmospheric deposition is the primary source of Hg to the watershed in the absence of point source discharges or mineral contributions. The majority of the Hg deposited from the atmosphere to the watershed is retained by the soils. The flux of Hg from the atmosphere to the watershed of Onondaga Lake is estimated at 20-30 mu g . m(-2). yr(-1), based on measurements of Hg deposition in urbanized regions of the United States and Europe. Watershed specific yield from three of the four tributaries that feed Onondaga Lake ranges from 5.3 to 7.5 mu g . m(-2). yr(-1). These watershed Hg export rates are higher than those observed for forested areas and represent approximately 25 percent of the estimated deposition to this urban location. The Hg-T specific yield from the fourth tributary, Ninemile Creek, was substantially higher. This creek had the highest suspended solids loading and receives runoff from an inactive chloralkali plant site. A summertime buildup of Hg species was observed in the hypolimnion of this thermally stratified lake (Jacobs et al., 1995). Sediment trap collections indicated that particle settling facilitates the accumulation of Hg in the hypolimnion. The sources of CH3Hg to the hypolimnion include tributary input and in situ bacterially mediated methylation. The impact of the entrainment of Hg-rich hypolimnetic water following fall destratification on the bioaccumulation of CH3Hg was not clear, because plankton CH3Hg levels were not generally higher following fall overturn.

In this study, the impacts of three major factors on the water exchange in the YPRLS from 1989 to 2016 were distinguished. Our results revealed that the catchment inflow into Poyang Lake (CIPL) dominates the variations in Q(h) (the discharge of Poyang Lake's outflow), contributing nearly 100 % of the annual variation and evenly 120 % of the seasonal variations. The forcing of the Yangtze River, including the effect of operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and effects of other Yangtze-related factors in addition to it, stably explains approximately over 76 % of the annual and seasonal variations in Z(h) (water level at the junction of the river and lake). The sensitivity coefficient of the seasonal Q(h) to the CIPL and that of the seasonal Z(h) to the forcing of the Yangtze River, varying with the seasons, are 0.63 and 0.41, respectively. Furthermore, the CIPL-induced and the Yangtze-induced frequency of the backflow from the river to the lake (BRL) is 26 times and 7 times, respectively. Specifically, the frequency of BRL events with backflow discharge of <3000 m(3)/s and >3000 m(3)/s is mainly affected by the CIPL and the forcing of the Yangtze River, respectively. The variations in the seasonal Z(h) are speculated to be influenced by the water regime and the stage-discharge relationships, which may explain the stable dominate of the forcing of the Yangtze River on the seasonal Z(h), and may affect the timing of autumn drought in the Poyang Lake. Our results may help to capture the main causes of complex hydrological changes in the YPRLS.					yang, linhan/LTF-3742-2024														0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2022	612		B						128183	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128183		JUL 2022											WOS:000860661200002

Regional populations, and possibly subspecies, occur in the Danube, Dniester, Dnieper, and Don rivers. Pontic shad, the most abundant shad of Eastern Europe, migrates 500 km upstream for spawning in the Danube River at the end of March in waters of 3-5degreesC. The peak of these movements occurs in April-May at 9-17degreesC, with the run ending in July-August at 22-26degreesC. Pelagic eggs and larvae drift seaward in the upper 0-0.5-m layer of river water. Young-of-the-year Pontic shad feed in brackish waters near the Danube delta, with juveniles leaving the shoreline in autumn. The adult stock lives at depths of 50-100 m, feeding mainly on fish. The longevity of Pontic shad is 5-7 years, with maturity occurring at 3-4 years. Most die after the spawning migration, with less than 10% spawning repeatedly. The other two shad species spawn in brackish water of deltas and lagoon lakes. The Pontic shad fishery is the most important, followed by that of Caspian shad; the Black Sea shad fishery has collapsed. Fishing pressure and pollution are the main threats for Pontic shad. However, spawning habitat for Caspian shad and Black Sea shad have drastically decreased due to damming. River fisheries for Pontic shad are managed primarily through season and area closures. Species behavior, spawning and recruitment, year-class strength, and estimation of population dynamics remain open research and management issues.

This is in stark contrast to the patterns of water contact, which differ greatly between fishing and non-fishing communities. On Lake Albert, adults appear to be more heavily exposed than children. From these observations we conclude that adults are physiologically (perhaps immunologically) more resistant to infection after treatment than children.					; Dunne, David/AAC-2530-2020	Butterworth, Anthony/0009-0009-1647-9654; Dunne, David/0000-0002-8940-9886													0031-1820					JAN	1999	118		1				101	105		10.1017/S0031182098003576	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182098003576								10070667					WOS:000078216200013

We analyze the concentrations of eight ions, total dissolved solids, and stable isotope composition of the lake and groundwater, as well as radioactive isotope tritium concentration in groundwater. The results show that annual and seasonal variations of the physical and chemical characteristics of Lake Nuoertu water are significantly greater than those of groundwater. The lake is uniformly mixed in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the hydrochemical types of the lake at different depths are consistent for Na-Cl-CO3-(SO4). Stable isotope composition of the lake and groundwater at Nuoertu is distributed along the local evaporation line (EL) slope, which is less than the slope of the global meteoric water line. The comparatively small slope shows the characteristic strong evaporation in the study area. Lake water isotopes are mostly in the upper right corner of the EL, whereas groundwater is mostly in the lower left corner. The main recharge source of Nuoertu lake water is groundwater, in combination with lake water and groundwater level change. The age of tufa springs around Nuoertu is about 75-80 a, which shows that the initial recharge source of the lake is a mix between modern and 1952 or older; however, further research is required.

LABORATORY EVALUATION OF POROUS IRON COMPOSITE FOR AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE WATER FILTER TREATMENT	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Agricultural subsurface drainage waters containing nutrients (nitrate/phosphate) and pesticides are discharged into neighboring streams and lakes, frequently producing adverse environmental impacts on local, regional, and national scales. On-site drainage water filter treatment systems can potentially prevent the release of agricultural contaminants into adjacent waterways. A recently developed porous iron composite (PIC) product may have promise as a filter material for drainage water treatment. Therefore, a laboratory study was initiated to evaluate the feasibility of using PIC for this purpose. Laboratory experiments included saturated falling-head hydraulic conductivity tests, contaminant (nutrient/pesticide) removal batch tests, and saturated solute transport column tests. The saturated falling-head hydraulic conductivity tests indicate that the original PIC product by itself has a high enough hydraulic conductivity (>0.001 cm s(-1)) to make this material hydraulically practical for filter treatment use. PIC hydraulic conductivity can be further enhanced (>0.01 cm s(-1)) by utilizing only the portion of this material retained on a 100 mesh sieve (particle size > 0.15 mm). Batch test results carried out with spiked drainage water and either unsieved or 100 mesh sieved PIC showed nitrate reductions of greater than 30%, and 100% removal of the pesticide atrazine. Saturated solute transport column tests with spiked drainage water provided more insight on the effectiveness and efficiency of utilizing PIC for drainage water filter treatment. These column tests confirm that PIC is capable of nearly complete removal of atrazine, and significant nitrate reduction. Additionally once the phosphate originally present within the PIC material is leached out, the PIC then exhibited ability to remove large quantities of phosphate. Consequently, these laboratory findings support employment of PIC for use within on-site agricultural drainage water filter treatment systems.																			2151-0032	2151-0040				SEP-OCT	2012	55	5					1683	1697																WOS:000311330100006

Abundance and movement patterns of age-0 juvenile lake sturgeon in the Peshtigo River, Wisconsin	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												In Great Lakes tributaries, age-0 juvenile lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens use riverine nursery habitats during their first summer of life and migrate to adjacent lakes after a seasonal decline in water temperature. We used mark-recapture data collected during this river-residency phase to monitor patterns in juvenile abundance and movement in the Peshtigo River, Wisconsin, during 2006 and 2007. Jolly-Seber and multistate models were used to estimate abundance and describe the probability of movement between river sections. Juvenile abundance was higher in 2007 than in 2006; however, in both years, abundance at the end of the sampling season was lower than at the beginning. Downstream movements were observed more frequently than upstream movements, and the probability of a downstream movement was higher than the probability of an upstream movement. The lower abundance later in the sampling season and propensity for downstream movements suggests that some age-0 juvenile lake sturgeon may leave the natal river before a seasonal decline in water temperature.

Chloride trends in Ontario's surface and groundwaters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks leads 11 long-term monitoring pro-grams at over 2,500 surface and groundwater sampling locations across the province that report chloride (Cl-) concentration, some dating back to the 1960s. This study integrates these disparate datasets to pro-vide comprehensive evidence relevant to spatial and temporal Cl- trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes, and Ontario's inland lakes, streams and groundwaters. While the vast majority of historical Cl- data indicate concentrations are well below the chronic exposure Canadian Water Quality Guideline (120 mg L-1), many lake, stream and groundwater sampling locations proximal to roadways or in urbanized areas meet or exceed this guideline, and concentrations in these regional areas are persistently increasing. The cur-rent evidence implicates road salting activities for winter safety as a primary contributor to elevated Cl- concentrations, and the trends may be exacerbated with urbanization and population expansion, partic-ularly in southern Ontario.

In mid-summer 2018, along with Moina salina, which had previously been reported from the lake, the year-round presence of further two cladoceran species, Chydorus sphaericus and Bosmina (Eubosmina) coregoni, was recorded there for the first time. None of those species had ever been registered from hypersaline waters anywhere else. Their introduction seems to have occurred because of a salinity decrease, even though the modern level of salinity has been observed the same level for at least the past 20 years. The presently highly eutrophic environment of Moynaki Lake is probably sufficiently energy-rich to sustain cladoceran osmo-adaptations.

The Role of Climate and Lake Size in Regulating the Ice Phenology of Boreal Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We quantified the relationships between seasonal air temperatures and ice phenology for a 0.54 km(2) boreal lake in Northwestern Ontario, Canada using a 50-year time series (1970-2019). Significant temporal trends in the duration of ice cover (-4.0 days decade(-1)) occurred over the study period and both ice-on and ice-off dates were highly predictable from seasonal air temperatures. While temporal trends in ice-off dates were not significant, ice-on dates trended later by 2.2 days decade(-1), and both ice-off dates and the duration of ice-cover became increasingly variable over the study period. For three consecutive winter seasons, we also evaluated regional variations of ice-phenology and snow and ice-thickness from 9 to 30 boreal lakes across a lake size gradient (0.02-26 km(2)) using ground based and satellite observations. Regional variation of ice-on dates (30-45 days), ice-off dates (10-21 days), and total duration of ice-cover (22-38 days) between lakes displayed significant nonlinear relationships to lake size across all years. Regional variation of ice-off dates was structured according to lake size, and appeared driven by relationships between lake size, snow thickness, and ice thickness. Multiple linear regression and generalized additive modeling approaches to predict ice-on and ice-off dates at the regional scale by integrating the effects of air temperature and lake size had similar performance, explaining >90% of the variance of observed.					; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016	van der Sanden, Josephus Johannes/0000-0003-0407-2733; Hrenchuk, Lee/0000-0002-6194-094X; Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2021	126	3							e2020JG005898	10.1029/2020JG005898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG005898													WOS:000636286700008

Sexual maturity is cyclical and seasonal, with a peak coinciding with the seasonal summer rains. Development from non-ripe adult fish to those in the ripe stages takes less than 1 mo. Descriptions of the stages of development are given. A line separating ripe and non-ripe groups of fish has the formula: FL = 0.5FS where FL is the number of large ova and FS is the number of small ova. The fecundity of ripe fish is related to length (total length = TL) by the cubic function F = 0.04TL (cm)3.39. The ova have a bimodal size distribution, suggesting the possibility of multiple spawning cycles in any 1 yr. Spawning capability is very closely related to ovary wt. Spawning behavior in the Nile catfish, C. lazera, follows the pattern of C. gariepinus.																			0024-4082	1096-3642					1979	65	4					351	365		10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01100.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01100.x													WOS:A1979HA76500004

The grain size distributions are dominated by clayey silts for both the bulk sediments and magnetic separates. Acquisition of isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and thermal demagnetization of IRM suggest (titano) magnetite as the dominating magnetic mineral in the sediments; high coercivity minerals are not detected. Therefore, the ratio of the susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (k (ARM)) to the weak field magnetic susceptibility (k), k (ARM)/k can be used to estimate the grain size of magnetite. The sediments and volcanic rocks yield values of 13.7 and 11.8 for the k (ARM)/(k), respectively, corresponding to grain size values of similar to 0.03 A mu m and similar to 0.05 A mu m. The magnetic granulometry of lake sediments is distinctive from one of the Chinese loess, in which published data suggest a value of 6.0 for k (ARM)/(k), and grain size of similar to 0.1 A mu m, but is akin to the nearby volcanic rocks. Although a Loess Plateau source of the lake sediments cannot be fully ruled out, the catchment is most probably the main source. We explain the slightly finer magnetite grain size in sediments than in the volcanic rocks as being disintegrated of particles during erosion and transportation. We conclude that there is no evidence for aeolian input of the Loess Plateau dusts into the Huguang Maar, and the relationship between magnetic parameters of the lake sediments and winter monsoon intensity is probably more complicated than previously thought.																			1001-6538	1861-9541				FEB	2010	55	4-5					418	424		10.1007/s11434-009-0585-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-009-0585-5													WOS:000274843600015

The density of dsrA in the chemocline reached up to 3.1 x 10(6) copies ml(-1) in summer by means of quantitative real-time PCR and it was generally higher than deeper layers. Most of the dsrA clones sequenced were related to green sulfur bacteria such as Chlorobium phaeovibrioides, C. limicola, and C. luteolum. Below the chemocline of the lake, we also detected other dsrA clones related to the purple sulfur bacterium Halochromatium salexigens and some branching lineages of diverse sequences that were related to chemotrophic sulfur bacterial species such as Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, Candidatus Ruthia magnifica, and Candidatus Thiobios zoothamnicoli. The abundance and community compositions of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria changed depending on the water depth and season. This study indicated that the green sulfur bacteria dominated among sulfur-oxidizing bacterial population in the chemocline of Lake Suigetsu and that certain abiotic environmental variables were important factors that determined sulfur bacterial abundance and community structure.

Tree ring-reconstructed late summer moisture conditions, 1546 to present, northern Lake Michigan, USA	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Drought can affect even humid regions like northeastern North America, which experienced significant, well-documented dry spells in the 1930s, 50s, 60s, and 80s, and proxies tell us that in the years before instrumentally recorded climate, droughts could be even more severe. To get a more complete picture of pre-recorded climate, the spatial coverage of proxy-based climate reconstructions must be extended. This can better put in context past, current, and future climate, and it can lend anthropological and historical insights. With regard to tree rings as climate proxies, however, there is increasing evidence that relationships between tree growth and climate can be inconsistent over time, in some cases decreasing the utility of tree rings in the representation of climate. We developed a chronology from white cedar Thuja occidentalis tree ring widths for the period 1469-2015 C.E. with which we modeled the relationship between growth and July-September moisture conditions (Palmer Z index). The relationship was consistent across the period of instrumentally recorded climate, 1895-present, and the model explained 27 % of variability. Therefore, we used the model to reconstruct July-September moisture conditions from 1546-2014. We found the most variable century to be the 20th, the least the 18th. The severest decade-scale droughts (x0.75 SD from mean) occurred in the 1560s, 1600s/10s, 1630s, 1770s/80s, 1840s, and 1910s/20s, the severest pluvials (>= 0.75 SD) in the 1610s/20s, 1660s/70s, and the 1970s/80s. The occasional occurrence of severe droughts throughout the reconstruction, increasing variability in the 20th century, and expected climate change-enhanced late summer drought, portend a future punctuated with severe droughts.

During retreat of Late Wisconsinan glaciers, this basin was occupied by a short-lived glacial lake impounded by remnant ice in coastal fjords, and drained by a spillway at the western end of the lake. Evidence for this lake is fragmentary, and consists of strandline features that fall on a plane of elevation consistent with the post-glacial isostatic tilt. Following collapse of the ice dams and subsequent lake drainage at some time prior to 12220 yr BP, the Deer Lake basin was inundated by the sea to an elevation of about 45 m a.s.l. Deltas were formed at the basin edges, and thick successions of fine-grained rhythmites blanketed the basin floor. Isostatic rebound resulted in falling relative sea levels, and, following a stillstand marked by a period of deltaic deposition at 33 m a.s.l., isolation oi the Deer Lake basin from marine influence in the early Holocene. This style of deglaciation differs from previously accepted models for this part of eastern Canada, which showed progressive retreat from the coast to remnant centres on topographic highs. In the model proposed here, a large, low-elevation basin was deglaciated early, at a similar time to ice retreat to coastal positions from offshore. This pattern of deglaciation may be found in other areas with similar topographic settings.																			0267-8179					DEC	1993	8	4					327	337		10.1002/jqs.3390080404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3390080404													WOS:A1993MQ14900003

A total of 15 anomalous birds were banded and examined; these had variably masculinized plumages that could be tentatively classified into three phases: A (extensively masculinized), B (moderately masculinized), and C (partially masculinized). Unbanded birds with the same external features were also found at the same location. Based on these birds and data from a previous study, the prevalence of anomalous birds at the study site during the past 10 winters (1998-2008) was 0.01-0.18% (mean 0.07%) of the local population per winter, or approximately 3,800-8,500 individuals. Anatomical examination of the eight birds sacrificed showed that their ovary had remarkably degenerated, although their oviduct and syrinx were morphologically normal; two of these were < 1 year of age, and the others were adults of unknown age. No such degeneration was seen in the ovary of controls, even those of a considerable age (> 8 years old). Long-term observation of one of the focal birds showed that the external masculinization had commenced at a certain adult stage, progressing slowly thereafter. In term of behaviors, these anomalous birds were sexually inactive, although one of them showed temporarily and exceptionally the burping behavior, which is a male-type courtship display. We consider that all of these masculinized traits seen in the Northern Pintail females were caused by spontaneous ovarian degeneration after sex differentiation.

Analysis of fin clips as a nonlethal method for monitoring mercury in fish	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Monitoring of mercury in fish typically involves removal of individuals from the sampled population and subsequent analysis of fillets. This study assessed whether the analysis of fins, structures routinely clipped to mark released fish in population studies, could provide a nonlethal approach for estimating mercury concentrations in axial muscle (fillets). We analyzed fillets and selected fins from 401 northern pike (Esox lucius) and 79 walleye (Sander vitreus) from 21 lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin, 19 Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) from Toolik Lake, Alaska, and 14 winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) from Long Island Sound, New York. On average, 83% of mercury in fins was methylmercury, and concentrations in the proximal portion were about half-those in the distal portion in pelvic fins. Mean concentrations of mercury in fins, averaged by species and fin type, ranged from 2.7 to 8.9% of those in fillets. Coefficients of determination (r(2)) for linear regressions of mercury concentrations in fillets against those in fins of individual fish ranged from 0.04 to 0.96 among species and water bodies (median r(2) = 0.52). The concentration in fin clips was a better predictor of mercury in fillets for individual Arctic grayling (r(2) = 0.65, n = 12 and r(2) = 0.84, n = 8) and winter flounder (r(2) = 0.94, n = 14) than for individual northern pike (median r(2) = 0.56) or walleye (median r(2) = 0.22) from a given lake. In northern pike in the 400-500 mm total-length interval, the mean concentrations of total mercury in caudal fins and fillets, averaged by lake (n = 12), were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.95). The analysis of composited samples of fin clips from fish within a restricted length interval could, therefore, be a useful screening tool for assessing the relative mercury contamination of fish among different water bodies.

A Leslie population estimate indicated 1556 brook trout survived from stocking to the start of the season on Feb. 1. Between Feb. 1 and 6, an estimated 1587 stocked fish were taken during 742 angler trips (4.2 trips/ha). Only 121 brook trout were caught from Feb. 7-March 31 in 706 angler trips. Estimated total catch for the season was 1708 trout, of which 92% were taken in 6 days during the 1st wk of the season. Only 22 of these fish were caught in the open-water season of 1977. Near total exploitation early in the ice-fishing season is indicated. Stocking of hatchery-reared brook trout to provide winter recreation in special situations is feasible.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1980	109	3					282	286		10.1577/1548-8659(1980)109<282:REOHBT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1980)109<282:REOHBT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1980JZ74600003

Some 2670 specimens were identified belonging to 18 spp., 8 of which are new records for Quebec [Canada] [Chelipoda contracta Melander, C. praestans Melander, Chelifera banksi Melander, C. obsoleta Loew, Hemerodromia captus Coquillett, H. melanosoma Melander, H. vittata Loew and Thanategia defecta Loew]. Except for the early-emerging Clinocera fuscipennis Loew (May) and the late-appearing Thanategia defecta (Aug.), the dance flies are summer species. H. empiformis (Say) has a bimodal emergence and may have 2 generations/year; the other species appear to be univoltine. There is a rapid succession in the appearance of species in June; the males are relatively short-lived; the females often persist throughout the summer. H. captus is lentic, occurring in 2 of the lakes; H. melanosoma, though predominantly lotic, also inhabits 1 of the lakes, and all the other species are restricted to lotic habitats. The species of Chelipoda, Chelifera and Thanategia are more or less confined to small headwater streams, while those of Hemerodromia, Neoplasta and Roederiodes typically inhabit the mainstream and the larger tributaries. Most of the mainstream species seem to prefer fast waters on a substrate of moss and rubble, though individual species differ in their stenotopy. Other species discussed are Chelipoda elongata Melander, Chelifera palloris Coquillett, H. chillcotti Harper, H. rogatoris Coquillett, Neoplasta scapularis Loew, Clinocera sp., Roederiodes junctus Coquillet and R. recurvatus Chillcott.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1980	104	1					110	117		10.2307/2424964	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424964													WOS:A1980KG11300012

Phytoplankton community of Lake Baskandi anua, Cachar District, Assam, North East India - An ecological study	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Diversity, relative abundance and dominance of phytoplankton community of the Lake Baskandi anua, an oxbow lake of Assam, North east India were studied during December 2009 to November 2010. Chlorophyll content and biomass of phytoplankton along with physico-chemical properties of water of the lake were also estimated. The lake is covered with Hydrilla and other macrophytes like Eichhornia, Trapa, Altrnenthera, Polygonum, Ludwizia sp., etc. Seasonal fluctuations of 41 genera of phytoplankton, belonging to 5 groups (Chlorophyceae, Cyanobacteria, Bacil-lariophyceae, Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae) were encountered in the lake. Chlorophyceae was found to be highest in winter, Cyanobacteria and Euglena in monsoon and Bacillariophyceae in pre monsoon. According to Engelmann's scale, Spirogyra indica was found eudominant followed by 10 dominant, 24 subdominant and 20 recedent species. Chlorophyll-a content of phytoplankton varied from 14.18 to 33.89 mu g.L-1, during the study period. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant seasonal variation in physico-chemical properties of water like Water temperature, pH, Conductivity, Dissolved oxygen, Free CO2, Total alkalinity, Calcium, Chloride, Nitrate and Ammonia. Relationship between phytoplankton group assemblage and environmental variables were explored by the ordination method CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis).

Release of CO2 and CH4 from small wetland lakes in western Siberia	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												CO, and CH4 fluxes were measured front three small wetland lakes located in the middle taiga and forest tundra zones on West Siberian Lowlands (WSL), the world's largest wetland area. Fluxes were measured during summer 2005 using floating chambers and were validated against the thin boundary layer model based on the relationship between gas exchange and wind speed. All Studied lakes were supersaturated with CO2 and CH4, and acted on a seasonal basis as sources of these,greenhouse bases to the atmosphere. Daily mean CO, fluxes measured with chambers ranged from near the zero to 3.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and corresponding CH4 fluxes from 1.1 to 120 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). CH4 ebullition (0.65-11 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) was detected in two of the lakes. Total carbon evasion from the studied lakes during the active season was 23-66 g C m(-2). of which more than 90% was released as CO2-C. The carbon loss per unit area from the studied lakes was of similar magnitude as previously reported values of net carbon uptake of Siberian peatlands. This emphasizes the importance of small water-bodies in the carbon balance of West Siberian landscape.					; Lapshina, Elena/AAC-5538-2019; Marushchak, Maija/G-1444-2011; Naumov, Aleksei/A-6257-2016	Lapshina, Elena/0000-0001-5571-7787; Naumov, Aleksei/0000-0003-4942-0375; 													1600-0889					NOV	2007	59	5					788	796		10.1111/j.1600-0889.2007.00301.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2007.00301.x													WOS:000250752400002

Due to heavy nutrient load of the river Oder especially the large Oder Lagoon (680 km(2)) suffers from severe eutrophication. Heavy cyanobacteria blooms and high water turbidity are common during summer and a problem for further tourist development. Three applications of a flexible two-dimensional flow and transport model system covering extremely different spatial scales are presented to underline the value of this simple tool for research and coastal management: a) Water flow and transport simulations in the Oder Lagoon during the extreme Oder flood of August 1997 were used to explain the large scale suspended matter and algae (Mycrocystis) distribution, visible on satellite images. b) flow simulations were conducted to analyse an extreme small-scale sub-surface patchiness of Ceratium in a sheltered bay (0.15 km(2)). c) The model was applied to simulate flow in a littoral zone and inside reed stands. Algae patchiness is visible on very different spatial scales and hydrodynamics plays a major role for its formation. The model system with its modifications, like spatial wind inhomogeneity, spatially variable bottom friction and locally increased grid density allowed to tackle problems with different spatial scales and to achieve a closer linkage between hydro-physics and biology. It is a valuable tool to predict the transport of algae and the endangerment of beaches. In this regard remote sensing is an important supporting method.																			0031-5362					SEP	2000	102			1			65	75																WOS:000166145900009

Here, we report a decadal-resolution sedimentological record from an annually laminated archive from the western Loess Plateau spanning the Middle-Late Holocene, along with a database of archaeological radiocarbon dates in northern central China. Our results reveal the occurrence of 400-600-yr cyclic variations in the climate over the last 6200 years, which correlate well with the periodicities of solar activity and the East Asian summer monsoon. This mode of climate change is associated temporally and regionally with specific prehistoric human activities. More favorable warm-humid environmental conditions may have simultaneously facilitated cultural prosperity and population growth, while less favorable cold-dry periods may have led to cultural alterations and population decline. In addition, we determine that there is a closely coupled relationship between the fluctuations in geopolitical and socioeconomic variables and the cyclicity of the environmental changes in imperial China. That is, the warm-humid cycles are characterized by the northward expansion of agriculturalist empires, a decrease in the number of battles, bumper grain harvests, and economic development, while the cold-dry cycles are characterized by the southward expansion of pastoralist empires, an increase in the number of battles, famines, and economic recession. Further analysis of our study will increase the understanding of human dispersal, cultural exchanges, and climate-human interactions within and beyond northern China.

Zircon xenocryst resorption and magmatic regrowth at El Chichon Volcano, Chiapas, Mexico	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												El Chichon volcano is the only active volcano located within the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc in southern Mexico, which lies between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Central American Volcanic Arc. Previous studies have shown that similar to 12 eruptions have occurred at El Chichon within the last 8000 years, forming a complex of lava domes with a central crater and surrounding pyroclastic deposits. Here, we report the discovery of zircon in Holocene El Chichon rocks, which were analyzed by high spatial resolution imaging (color cathodoluminescence CCL) and isotopic (secondary ionization mass spectrometry SIMS) methods to resolve core and rim crystallization ages. Pumice samples from five proximal pyroclastic flow and fall-out deposits were collected based on published stratigraphy. Two of the samples were further (re-)classified by new C-14 dates. In addition, we sampled two lavas from the 1982 eruption and from remnants of the older Somma lava complex. Zircon crystals were dated using Th-230/U-238 disequilibrium (U-Th) and U-Pb geochronology. U-Th zircon ages fall between near eruption ages and ca. 84 ka, with overlapping ages in all samples. By contrast, zircon core U-Pb ages range between ca. 290 Ma and 1.9 Ga. These ages are consistent with xenocrystic origins and their heterogeneity indicates derivation from clastic country rocks. Strong age contrasts between inherited xenocrystic and young magmatic domains in individual zircon crystals are evidence for arrested assimilation of crustal rocks where initially zircon-undersaturated magmas cooled rapidly to form a crystal mush or subsolidus amalgamate as a crustally contaminated boundary layer. This layer contributed zircon crystals to eruptible magma during episodic recharge events followed by partial melt extraction, mixing and homogenization. Zircon overgrowths are significantly older than major minerals whose U-series ages and sharp zonation boundaries suggest crystallization only within a few ka before eruption. This implies that zircon can detect magmatic longevity which is obscured in the major mineral record. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	JONASSON, PM				JONASSON, PM			LAKE MYVATN ECOSYSTEM, ICELAND	OIKOS												Lake Myvatn lies at 63.degree.35''N and 17.degree.00''W and at 278 m above sea level in northern Iceland. The climate is more continental than maritime. But in some years the proximity to the Arctic Circle causes the climate to be cold, wet and foggy. Lake Myvatn has 2 basins: the north basin and the south basin. Volcanic activity since 1975 has caused a land rise of 34 cm at the northeast coast of the north basin. Water enters the lake mainly from cold and warm springs along the east shore (range 5.2-23.1.degree. C) and is discharged, to the west, into the River Laxa. The drainage basin is at least 1000 km2. Retention time in the north basin was 14 days and in south basin, 24 days. Temperature records reveal large variations in response to climatic factors. Air temperatures correlate well with water temperature. The annual amplitude of water temperature was 18.degree. C with a daily amplitude of 3.degree. C in south basin. Wind-induced water level fluctuations are 0.7 m in the north basin and 0.4 m in the south basin. Average ice-cover is 190 days yr-1. Resuspension is high and varies with depth. It was 3 times higher in the north than the south basin. The resuspension provides renewal of nutrients from the bottom, but P seems limiting during calm periods with high demands. N-fixation ensures sufficient N. The N:P ratio in the outlet is 8:1. An inverse thermocline develops in winter and O2 is depleted from the bottom water, but oxygenated conditions are re-established in Feb.-March due to production of benthic diatoms. Phytoplankton gross production was 118 g C m-2 yr-1 in the south basin but only 75 in the north basin. Seasonal succession was unimodal. High production due to Anabaena flos-aquae coincided with high radiation, high temperature and time of ice-break. Production was low at other seasons despite considerable biomass of diatoms and chrysophyceans. Net production in the south basin was calculated to 600 kcal m-2 yr-1. A net production of benthic diatoms amounted to 2220 kcal m-2 yr-1. A dim-light adapted Cladophora aegagropila forms massive phytobenthos in the south basin with 50 g ash-free dry weight m-2. Calculated production was 500 kcal m-2 yr-1. Macro- and epiphytes are important in the north-basin. A living substratum of Cladophora and macrophytes stabilizes the sediment and acts as a sieve for resuspended organic matter. A close relation was found between substrate type and zoobenthos abundance and production. In the south basin, with mud and Cladophora, chironomids dominate numerically (average of total zoobenthos 75,500 individuals m-2) and in terms of production (200 kcal m-2 yr-1). In the north basin, with diatoms, average values are 9750 m-2 and 32 kcal m-2 yr-1. Benthic Crustacea produce approximately 10 kcal m-2 yr-1 in both basins. Zooplankton produced on an average 43 and 15 kcal m-2 yr-1 in the south and north basin, respectively. Fish production, calculated from catch data, was 3 kcal m-2 yr-1 and ducks produced 0.5 kcal m-2 yr-1. Thus energy flow is mainly channeled through phyto- and zoobenthos.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	32	1-2					289	305		10.2307/3544234	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544234													WOS:A1979HJ61200018

Jeffery			Seasonal Movement and Mesohabitat Usage of Adult and Juvenile Lake Sturgeon in the Grasse River, New York	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Long-term restoration efforts for lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens populations will benefit from better understanding of this species' movements and habitat use in riverine systems. Radio transmitters were implanted in both juvenile and adult lake sturgeon in the Grasse River, New York, and individuals were relocated over a 2-year period. Adult lake sturgeon demonstrated greater minimum daily distance moved, absolute distance moved, and mean home range size than juvenile lake sturgeon during the spring. During the course of the study, both adult and juvenile lake sturgeon exhibited movements upstream and downstream through a breached low-head weir, and individuals did not necessarily remain resident on an annual basis in the Grasse River. Mesohabitat and substrate use patterns were determined based on comparisons of frequency distributions for relocated lake sturgeon and quantified mesohabitat and substrate over a 15-km river reach. Lake sturgeon used pool mesohabitat and limited their use of run mesohabitat under both low- and mid-flow conditions. During most of the year, adult and juvenile lake sturgeon were detected over silt substrate. This study illustrates behavioral differences and similarities between the movements and habitat use of adult and juvenile lake sturgeon in a riverine system.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2011	140	4					1006	1014		10.1080/00028487.2011.603981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.603981													WOS:000296142700013
J	Siwik, EIH; Campbell, LM; Mierle, G				Siwik, Eden I. H.; Campbell, Linda M.; Mierle, Gregory			Fine-scale mercury trends in temperate deciduous tree leaves from Ontario, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study focused on the value of deciduous leaves as biomonitors of total mercury (THg). Leaf samples were collected from a range of deciduous species from five sampling sites in the province of Ontario, Canada. These included a site in the northwest (the Experimental Lakes Area, ELA), two sites in central Ontario (the town of Dorset and the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments. CARE), and two sites in the southeast (Sandbanks Provincial Park, SBPP and the City of Kingston). The sampled species exhibited distinctive species-specific differences with red oaks consistently having lower IeafTHg concentrations than all maple species, while black and white ash leaves had the highest concentrations. Spatially, leaves collected across the distance between ELA and SBPP (similar to 1500 km apart) had overlapping THg concentrations between 20 and 40 ng/g. Unexpectedly, leaves from urban parks of Kingston had considerably lower THg concentrations (<25 ng/g) than the other sites, which suggested leaves may not reflect subtle gradients of atmospheric THg found under field conditions. Leaf THg increased with the growing season, with highest THg leaf concentrations found in early autumn just before senescence. Microspatial differences within a single tree, such as position on a branch are important. since higher mercury concentrations were associated with leaves positioned deeper into the canopy relative to outer leaves more exposed to wind turbulence and sunlight Within any single leaf, THg concentrations were highest in the leaf tissue, and consistently distributed, while the vein and petiole tissue had lower THg concentrations. There was no relationship between THg concentrations and leaf area. Using deciduous tree leaves as regional temporal monitors of bioavailable mercury may be feasible, but careful selection of leaf sampling sites on the tree itself and the timing is of utmost importance for ensuring consistent and high quality biomonitoring data.

Turbidity Currents With Equilibrium Basal Driving Layers: A Mechanism for Long Runout	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Turbidity currents run out over 100 km in lakes and reservoirs, and over 1,000 km in the ocean. They do so without dissipating themselves via excess entrainment of ambient water. Existing layer-averaged formulations cannot capture this. We use a numerical model to describe the temporal evolution of a turbidity current toward steady state under condition of zero net sediment flux at the bed. The flow self-partitions itself into two layers. The lower driving layer approaches an invariant flow thickness, velocity profile, and suspended sediment concentration profile that sequesters nearly all of the suspended sediment. This layer can continue indefinitely at steady state over a constant bed slope. The upper driven layer contains a small fraction of the suspended sediment. The devolution of the flow into these two layers likely allows the driving layer to run out long distances.

In the winter of 1998-1999, four levels of forest harvesting, including a no-harvest and a clearcut treatment, were applied to even-aged trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands according to a complete block design with three replications. Two partial cut treatments removed 33% and 61% of the stand basal area. During the first growing season, harvesting induced a large increase in indigenous understorey biomass that paralleled changes in the canopy opening. Aspen sucker density increased from 4916 stems/ha in the control to 28 751 and 63 333 stems/ha in the one-third and two-thirds harvesting treatments and 102 916 stems/ha in the clearcut. Most changes in nutrient cycling occurred in the second year and included an increase in forest floor organic C, total N, and base cation availability and a decrease in microbial ON ratio. These changes may have occurred in response to reduced vegetation uptake and woody debris abundance.

J	Viles, HA				Viles, Heather A.			Microbial geomorphology: A neglected link between life and landscape	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Whilst recognition is increasing that life and landscapes are intimately related, as evidenced by growing research into ecosystem engineering, biogeomorphology and allied topics, the microbial contribution to such interactions has been relatively neglected. A revolution in environmental microbiology, based on molecular techniques, is now driving a reconsideration of the role of microbial processes in geomorphology at all scales. Recent research illustrates the hitherto unknown microbial diversity present in many extreme geomorphic environments, such as hyperarid deserts, subglacial lakes, hot springs, and much richer microbial life than previously suspected within the soils and sediments that blanket most other landscapes. Such microbial communities have been found to play important geomorphic roles across a wide range of environments, notably in weathering, precipitation of minerals and protecting surfaces from erosion. These geomorphic roles can also be conceptualised as examples of ecosystem engineering, and can pave the way for further plant-geomorphology and zoogeomorphology processes. Three key aspects which emerge from a review of microbial influences on Earth surface processes are a) that microbes play roles on a continuum from full control to passive involvement, b) that complex and widespread communities of microorganisms are involved and c) that microbial activity usually affects several Earth surface processes at once. Examples of the contribution of microbial life to geomorphology over long, medium and short timescales suggest that microorganisms play key geomorphological roles in two major situations; on the cusp between stable states, and in extreme environments where higher plant and animal life is limited and many abiotic processes are also constrained. The dominant link between microbial life and geomorphology appears to take on different forms depending on the timescale under consideration, with a stabilising microbial role apparent over short timescales being replaced by a denudational role over longer timescales. Further research involving microbiologists and geomorphologists is now needed to address three main questions, i.e. under what conditions are microbial and geomorphological processes most closely linked?, what scale issues surround links between microbes and geomorphology? And how do microbiological processes underpin broader biogeomorphological interactions? (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Localization and seasonal variation of blue pigment (sandercyanin) in walleye (Sander vitreus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Several fish species, including the walleye (Sander vitreus), have "yellow" and "blue" color morphs. In S. vitreus, one source of the blue color has been identified as a bili-binding protein pigment (sandercyanin), found in surface mucus of the fish. Little is known about the production of the pigment or about its functions. We examined the anatomical localization and seasonal variation of sandercyanin in S. vitreus from a population in McKim Lake, northwestern Ontario, Canada. Skin sections were collected from 20 fish and examined histologically. Mucus was collected from 306 fish over 6 years, and the amount of sandercyanin was quantified spectrophotometrically. Sandercyanin was found solely on dorsal surfaces of the fish and was localized to novel cells in the epidermis, similar in appearance to secretory sacciform cells. Sandercyanin concentrations were significantly higher in fish collected in summer versus other seasons. Yellow and blue morphs did not differ in amounts of sandercyanin, suggesting that the observed blue color, in fact, arises from lack of yellow pigmentation in blue morphs. The function of the sandercyanin remains unclear, but roles in photoprotection and countershading are consistent with available data.					; Berges, John/D-9520-2012	Schaefer, Wayne/0000-0002-2151-1219; Schmitz, Mark/0009-0008-1260-0050; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2015	72	2					281	289		10.1139/cjfas-2014-0139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0139													WOS:000348795800012

Anoop			Isotopic signatures of moisture recycling and evaporation processes along the Western Ghats orography	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The water isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of humid tropical mountain belts is influenced by the limited isotopic elevation effect due to the narrow temperature gradient, high relative humidity, and the moisture feedback processes. The Western Ghats mountain forest ecosystem, recognized as a biological hotspot, contributes significantly to characterizing the hydrological and weather patterns over its windward and leeward sides. The Indian Summer Monsoon southwesterly winds advancing towards the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea between June to September are obstructed by this mountain belt and get orographically uplifted, producing heavy rainfall. The present study intends to improve understanding of the variation of precipitation isotopic composition along multiple stations located at different elevations of the heavily regulated Periyar river basin (PRB), southern Western Ghats, and a coastal station (TRV). The delta O-18 variation with elevation across PRB reveals an abrupt depletion at the highland station and a pseudo-elevation effect due to the supply of evaporated local moisture from reservoirs and lakes. The contribution of recycled precipitation estimated using back trajectories suggests a maximum of 8.5% of locally recycled rainfall over midland station towards the September month, the daily contribution reaching a maximum of 50.7%. Though this approach did not show any signatures of moisture recycling in the highland station, the surface water (reservoirs and lakes) lc-excess (line-conditioned excess), and the d-excess (deuterium excess) values of precipitation suggest the higher rates of evaporation from large water bodies and their successive role in generating local rainfall. Statistically significant amount effects visible only along coastal stations with lower rates of precipitation and higher temperature indicate that precipitation along the Ghats region (midland and highland) is significantly controlled by orographic uplift of air moisture and the contribution from locally recycled moisture. This is further supported by the significant correlation of delta O-18 with regional convective processes along the Arabian Sea till midland station and further decrease towards the highland. The present study provides important information on the moisture feedback mechanism in the Western Ghats and the factors controlling the isotopic signatures over the region.

Ecological Factors Affecting Rainbow Smelt Recruitment in the Main Basin of Lake Huron, 1976-2010	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax are native to northeastern Atlantic and Pacific-Arctic drainages and have been widely introduced throughout North America. In the Great Lakes region, Rainbow Smelt are known predators and competitors of native fish and a primary prey species in pelagic food webs. Despite their widespread distribution, importance as a prey species, and potential to negatively interact with native fish species, there is limited information concerning stock-recruitment relationships for Rainbow Smelt. To better understand recruitment mechanisms, we evaluated potential ecological factors determining recruitment dynamics for Rainbow Smelt in Lake Huron using data from bottom trawl catches. We specifically evaluated influence of stock size, environmental factors (water temperature, lake levels, and precipitation), and salmonine predation on the production of age-0 recruits from 1976 to 2010. Rainbow Smelt recruitment was negatively related to stock size exceeding 10 kg/ha, indicating that compensatory, density-dependent mortality from cannibalism or intraspecific competition was an important factor related to the production of age-0 recruits. Recruitment was positively related to spring precipitation suggesting that the amount of stream-spawning habitat as determined by precipitation was important for the production of strong Rainbow Smelt recruitment. Additionally, density of age-0 Rainbow Smelt was positively related to Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush abundance. However, spawning stock biomass of Rainbow Smelt, which declined substantially from 1989 to 2010, was negatively associated with Lake Trout catch per effort suggesting predation was an important factor related to the decline of age-2 and older Rainbow Smelt in Lake Huron. As such, we found that recruitment of Rainbow Smelt in Lake Huron was regulated by competition with or cannibalism by older conspecifics, spring precipitation influencing stream spawning habitats, and predation by Lake Trout on age-2 and older Rainbow Smelt.

J.; Hahn, Dittmar			Quantifying Salmonella Population Dynamics in Water and Biofilms	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Members of the bacterial genus Salmonella are recognized worldwide as major zoonotic pathogens often found to persist in non-enteric environments including heterogeneous aquatic biofilms. In this study, Salmonella isolates that had been detected repeatedly over time in aquatic biofilms at different sites in Spring Lake, San Marcos, Texas, were identified as serovars Give, Thompson, Newport and -:z10:z39. Pathogenicity results from feeding studies with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as host confirmed that these strains were pathogenic, with Salmonella-fed C. elegans dying faster (mean survival time between 3 and 4 days) than controls, i.e., Escherichia coli-fed C. elegans (mean survival time of 9.5 days). Cells of these isolates inoculated into water at a density of up to 10(6) ml(-1) water declined numerically by 3 orders of magnitude within 2 days, reaching the detection limit of our quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based quantification technique (i.e., 10(3) cells ml(-1)). Similar patterns were obtained for cells in heterogeneous aquatic biofilms developed on tiles and originally free of Salmonella that were kept in the inoculated water. Cell numbers increased during the first days to more than 10(7) cells cm(-2), and then declined over time. Ten-fold higher cell numbers of Salmonella inoculated into water or into biofilm resulted in similar patterns of population dynamics, though cells in biofilms remained detectable with numbers around 10(4) cells cm(-2) after 4 weeks. Independent of detectability by qPCR, samples of all treatments harbored viable salmonellae that resembled the inoculated isolates after 4 weeks of incubation. These results demonstrate that pathogenic salmonellae were isolated from heterogeneous aquatic biofilms and that they could persist and stay viable in such biofilms in high numbers for some time.																			0095-3628					JAN	2013	65	1					60	67		10.1007/s00248-012-0106-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-012-0106-y								22890729					WOS:000313369900007

Onset of the Laramide orogeny and associated magmatism in southern New Mexico based on U-Pb geochronology	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Laramide orogeny is a classic yet controversial mountain-building event that resulted, in the southwest United States, in uplifts, sedimentation, and magmatism that can be used to constrain the onset of this event in the region and expand our knowledge of Late Cretaceous to Paleogene tectonism. The McRae Formation marks the onset of deposition in the Laramide Love Ranch Basin, which was located to the northeast of the west-northwest-trending coeval Rio Grande uplift in south-central New Mexico, but its age is not well constrained. A previously published late Maastrichtian age for the McRae Formation was based on the presence of dinosaur bones in the upper of two members of the formation. We obtained new U-Pb dates from one dacite clast and three ash-fall tuffs from the lower Jose Creek Member and from one ash-fall tuff from the lower part of the overlying Hall Lake Member of the McRae Formation. The clast yielded a date of 75.0 +/- 1.1 Ma, whereas the ages of the tuffs, in ascending stratigraphic order, are 74.9 +/- 0.7 Ma, 74.7 +/- 0.6 Ma, 75.2 +/- 1.3 Ma, and 73.2 +/- 0.7 Ma. These dates indicate that the onset of Laramide deposition in the Love Ranch Basin must have occurred earlier, in late Campanian time, similar to deposition in the Laramide Ringbone Basin in southwestern New Mexico. In addition, U-Pb zircon dates of 75.7 +/- 1.3 Ma and 75.0 +/- 2.8 Ma were obtained on the Twin Peaks stock and on a dacite sill, respectively, in the Burro Mountains of southwestern New Mexico. These dates are similar to those of other Laramide arc magmatic centers in southern New Mexico, which have a limited range of ages from 75 to 70 Ma, including the Hidalgo Formation in the Little Hatchet Mountains, the Silver City-Pinos Altos region, and the Copper Flat porphyry system. These new and previously published dates indicate that during the onset of Laramide deformation in southwestern and south-central New Mexico, the angle of subduction of the Farallon plate may have been steep enough to allow partial melting of an asthenospheric wedge, resulting in arc magmatism far inboard of the trench.

First Prokaryotic Biodiversity Assessment Using Molecular Techniques of an Acidic River in Neuquen, Argentina	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Two acidic hot springs close to the crater of Copahue Volcano (Neuqu,n, Argentina) are the source of the Rio Agrio. The river runs several kilometres before flowing into Caviahue Lake. Along the river, temperature, iron, other metal and proton concentrations decrease gradually with distance downstream. From the source to the lake and depending on the season, pH can rise from 1.0 (or even less) to about 4.0, while temperature values decrease from 70A degrees C to 15A degrees C. Water samples were taken from different stations on the river selected according to their physicochemical parameters. In order to assess prokaryotic biodiversity throughout the water column, different and complementary molecular biology techniques were used, mainly in situ hybridisation and 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. All microorganisms found are typical of acidic environments. Sulphur-oxidizing bacteria like Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Acidithiobacillus albertensis were detected in every station. Moderately thermophile iron- and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria like members of Alicyclobacillus and Sulfobacillus genera were also ubiquitous. Strict iron-oxidizing bacteria like Leptospirillum and Ferrimicrobium were present at the source of the river, but disappeared downstream where iron concentrations were much lower. Iron-oxidizing, mesophilic Ferroplasma spp. were the main archaea found. The data presented in this work represent the first molecular assessment of this rare natural acidic environment.

J	Holko, L; Danko, M; Sleziak, P				Holko, Ladislav; Danko, Michal; Sleziak, Patrik			Snowmelt characteristics in a pristine mountain catchment of the Jalovecky Creek, Slovakia, over the last three decades	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Jalovecky Creek catchment, Slovakia (area 22.2 km(2), mean elevation 1500 m a.s.l.), is likely the last big valley complex in the Carpathian Mountains, in which the hydrological cycle is still governed by natural processes. Hydrological research is conducted there since the end of the 1980s. The overall mission of the research is to increase the knowledge about the hydrological cycle in the highest part of the Carpathians. The research agenda, briefly introduced in the first part of this article, is focused on water balance, snow accumulation and melt and runoff formation. Recent analysis of precipitation, discharge, snow cover and isotopic data from period 1989-2018 indicates that hydrological cycle has become more dynamic since 2014. Although several indicators suggest that it could be related to the cold part of the year, direct links with snow storage and the contribution of snowmelt water to catchment runoff were not confirmed. The second part of the article is therefore focused on an analysis of daily cycles in streamflow in March to June 1988-2018 to obtain a deeper insight into the snowmelt process. We describe characteristics of the cycles and examine their variability over the study period. The results indicate that less snow at the lowest elevations (800-1150 m a.s.l.) since 2009 could have influenced the cessation of the cycles in June since 2010. The possible role of the decreased amount of snow at the lowest elevations in changes in runoff characteristics is also suggested by an increase in time lags between maximum discharges during the events and maximum air temperatures preceding discharge maxima measured near the catchment outlet (at 750 m a.s.l.) in spring 2018 compared to springs with a similar number of streamflow cycles in the years 1988, 2000 and 2009. Wavelet analysis did not indicate changes in global power spectra in hourly discharge and air temperature data.					; Danko, Michal/AAP-4123-2021; Holko, Ladislav/AAT-4452-2021; Sleziak, Patrik/Q-3207-2018	Danko, Michal/0000-0003-1300-7706; Sleziak, Patrik/0000-0003-2973-3569													0885-6087	1099-1085				APR	2021	35	4							e14128	10.1002/hyp.14128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14128													WOS:000645220700028

High water transparency permits photosynthesis to a maximum depth of over 100 m. Average annual primary produciton rates in the entire trophogenic zone are 0.5-0.6 g C m-3 per yr. Nutrient concentrations and biomass parameters showed little diel variation. Photosynthesis in mixed water columns decreased in the afternoon. This decline can be attributed to inactivation of algae by overoptimal light during mid-day hours. As the summer season progressed, algae became adapted to high light intensities and were less susceptible to light inhibition. Extracellular release by algae averaged 12.5 .+-. 4.7% of assimilated C without significant vertical differences. Damage of cells by light can be excluded. Respiratory losses overnight comprised at least 30% of the C assimilated during the preceding day. Integral photosynthesis showed a logarithmic relationship to incident light which can be used to predict daily production rates from mid-day incubation with an error of well below 10%.																			0020-9309						1979	64	2					157	176		10.1002/iroh.19790640202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19790640202													WOS:A1979HH86500001

Influence of Abiotic Factors on the Spatio-temporal Distribution of Rotifers in a Subtropical Lake of Western Himalaya	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Spatial and temporal variation of rotifers in Lake Sattal of Western Himalaya was studied from January 2011 to December 2012. A total of 22 rotifer species could be identified in the lake with a biannual mean abundance of 2.07 x 10(6) individuals/m(3) in eastern basin and 1.92 x 10(6) individuals/m(3) in western basin having maximum abundance during summer season. The main factors regulating distribution patterns of rotifers are nutrients, viz. NH4-N, PO4-P, NO2-N, and NO3-N, and turbidity, pH, and transparency. Six species of rotifers were deliberated as important species based on importance value index. Keratella quadrata, Colurella obtusa, and Asplanchna priodonta flourish under low turbid conditions. Philodina roseola demonstrated as a phosphorous-tolerant species, whereas K. quadrata and C. obtusa are thermophilous and their distributions are highly influenced by pH and transparency. The total organic matter (TOM) of the sediment has a significant positive correlation with species richness and diversity. The hierarchical environmental descriptor suggests water chemistry has a greater significant role in assemblages of rotifers as compared to sediment characteristics.

This paper presents hydro-acoustic profiles and provide lithological and chronostratigraphical information from three up to 15.75 m long sediment sequences from the Macedonian side of the lake. The sediment sequences comprise glacial and interglacial sediments likely deposited from the end of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 to present day. The information implies a distinct change of sedimentation patterns at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition and the establishment of a relatively strong Holocene current system and deposition of channel-related contourite drift in Lake Prespa. Potential causes for the establishment of this current during the Holocene include significant lake level change, reduced winter ice cover, and/or higher aeolian activity.

However, there are many difficulties in mapping paddy rice, especially mapping multi-season paddy rice in rainy regions, including differences in phenology, the influence of weather, and farmland fragmentation. To resolve these problems, a novel multi-season paddy rice mapping approach based on Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 data is proposed. First, Sentinel-1A data were enhanced based on the fact that the backscattering coefficient of paddy rice varies according to its growth stage. Second, cropland information was enhanced based on the fact that the NDVI of cropland in winter is lower than that in the growing season. Then, paddy rice and cropland areas were extracted using a K-Means unsupervised classifier with enhanced images. Third, to further improve the paddy rice classification accuracy, cropland information was utilized to optimize distribution of paddy rice by the fact that paddy rice must be planted in cropland. Classification accuracy was validated based on ground-data from 25 field survey quadrats measuring 600 m x 600 m. The results show that: multi-season paddy rice planting areas effectively was extracted by the method and adjusted early rice area of 1630.84 km(2), adjusted middle rice area of 556.21 km(2), and adjusted late rice area of 3138.37 km(2). The overall accuracy was 98.10%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.94.					; Wu, Mingquan/X-4362-2019; niu, zheng/M-9923-2017; Tian, Haifeng/HLQ-5227-2023; Wang, Li/P-9811-2018	tian, haifeng/0000-0003-4567-2313; Wang, Li/0000-0002-2929-4255; niu, zheng/0000-0001-5959-9351														1424-8220				JAN	2018	18	1							185	10.3390/s18010185	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18010185								29324647					WOS:000423286300184

A New Geochemical Perspective on Hydrochemical Evolution of The Tibetan Geothermal System	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau has caused the development of many high-enthalpy geothermal fields that are rich in exploitable rare and dispersed resource elements. However, the mechanism of the unusual enrichment of these resource elements is still unclear. From a geochemical viewpoint, including major chemical compositions, some rare and dispersed resource elements and trace elements in geothermal water and some river samples from the northern Lhasa block (saline lake area), the southern Lhasa block (Gangdise volcanic belt) and Tethyan Himalaya in Tibet, this study provides new insights into the mechanism of the hydrochemical evolution of the Tibetan geothermal system. The Cl-type geothermal waters in the Gangdise volcanic belt and Tethyan sedimentary area show similar chemical characteristics that are apparently different from that of surface cold waters. The concentrations of Sb, Tl, As, K, Cs, Li, Rb, Ga, B, Cl, Th, Sc, Mn, V, and Ti in Cl-type geothermal waters are at least one order of magnitude higher than those in surface cold waters, but the concentrations of Ca, Mg, Ni, Cr, Zn, Fe, Co, Cu, Pb, and U in Cl-type geothermal waters are slightly higher or even lower than those in surface cold waters. Some rivers and streams in Tibet also show high concentrations of toxic elements. These rivers and streams are mainly polluted by geothermal spring discharge and are unsuitable for drinking. Some ions and elements (such as Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr, SO42- and Mn) in HCO3--type geothermal waters from sedimentary rocks are affected by the availability of soluble minerals such as calcite, dolomite and gypsum. However, the other dissolved elements in HCO3--type geothermal waters show the characteristic of mixing Cl-type geothermal waters with surface cold waters. The origin of deep fluids in Cl- and HCO3--type springs is related, and this origin probably involves the contribution of crustal partial melting rather than single rock leaching. Thus, deep circulating groundwater mixes with residual magmatic fluids and evolves into the unusual enrichment of geothermal mineral resources.

Large Spatial and Temporal Variability of Carbon Dioxide and Methane in a Eutrophic Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes are conduits of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere; however, most efflux estimates for individual lakes are based on extrapolations from a limited number of locations. Within-lake variability in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) arises from differences in water sources, mixing, atmospheric exchange, and biogeochemical transformations, all of which vary across multiple temporal and spatial scales. We asked, how variable are CO2 and CH4 across the surface of a single lake, how do spatial patterns change seasonally, and how well does the typical sampling location represent the entire lake surface? During the 2016 ice-free period, we mapped surface water concentrations of CO2 and CH4 approximately weekly in Lake Mendota (USA) and modeled diffusive gas exchange. During stratification, CO2 was generally lower than atmospheric saturation (mean 19.81 mu M) and relatively homogenous (mean coefficient of variation 0.12), whereas CH4 was routinely extremely supersaturated (mean 0.29 mu M) with greater spatial heterogeneity (mean coefficient of variation 0.65). During fall mixis, concentrations of both gases increased and became more spatially variable, but their spatial arrangements differed. In this system, samples collected from the lake center reasonably well represented the spatially weighted mean CO2 concentration but overestimated annual CO2 efflux by 21%. For CH4, the lake center underestimated annual diffusive efflux by only 8.6% but poorly represented lakewide concentrations and fluxes on any given day. Upscaling from a single site to the whole lake requires consideration of spatial variation to assess lakewide carbon dynamics due to heterogeneity in within-lake processing, transport to the lake surface, and exchange with the atmosphere.					; Desai, Ankur/A-5899-2008	Schramm, Paul/0000-0002-4155-0004; Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121; Desai, Ankur/0000-0002-5226-6041													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2019	124	7					2248	2266		10.1029/2019JG005186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005186													WOS:000481443800030

Improving the Simulation of Large Lakes in Regional Climate Modeling: Two-Way Lake-Atmosphere Coupling with a 3D Hydrodynamic Model of the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Accurate representations of lake-ice-atmosphere interactions in regional climate modeling remain one of the most critical and unresolved issues for understanding large-lake ecosystems and their watersheds. To date, the representation of the Great Lakes two-way interactions in regional climate models is achieved with one-dimensional (1D) lake models applied at the atmospheric model lake grid points distributed spatially across a 2D domain. While some progress has been made in refining 1D lake model processes, such models are fundamentally incapable of realistically resolving a number of physical processes in the Great Lakes. In this study, a two-way coupled 3D lake-ice-climate modeling system [Great Lakes-Atmosphere Regional Model (GLARM)] is developed to improve the simulation of large lakes in regional climate models and accurately resolve the hydroclimatic interactions. Model results are compared to a wide variety of observational data and demonstrate the unique skill of the coupled 3D modeling system in reproducing trends and variability in the Great Lakes regional climate, as well as in capturing the physical characteristics of the Great Lakes by fully resolving the lake hydrodynamics. Simulations of the climatology and spatiotemporal variability of lake thermal structure and ice are significantly improved over previous coupled, 1D simulations. At seasonal and annual time scales, differences in model results are primarily observed for variables that are directly affected by lake surface temperature (e.g., evaporation, precipitation, sensible heat flux) while no significant differences are found in other atmospheric variables (e.g., solar radiation, cloud cover). Underlying physical mechanisms for the simulation improvements using GLARM are also discussed.					; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014	Chu, Philip/0000-0002-3089-0353; Lenters, John/0000-0002-6895-7592; Pal, Jeremy/0000-0002-5937-0319; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X													0894-8755	1520-0442				MAR	2017	30	5					1605	1627		10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0225.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0225.1													WOS:000395539100004

Eggs laid by poorly fed adults lack volatile fatty acids and fail to develop normally. Problems in young fish first appeared in some specimens collected at Fernvale on the Brisbane River during a drought, when food supplies in the river began to fail. In 2016, after poor recruitment for several years, hatchlings from Lake Samsonvale were able to feed, and reached advanced stages in the laboratory, after a moderate amount of food for parent lungfish appeared in the lake during the summer before the 2016 spawning season. However, all died after 14 months. Lungs, intestines and nervous systems in the juveniles were anomalous, and would have precluded continued development in the wild. Survival of several young to juvenile stages in the laboratory does not mean that survival and recruitment to the adult population in the wild will follow.																			1038-2097	2204-4604					2019	25	3					283	298		10.1071/PC18046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/PC18046													WOS:000909400400007

Ice formation and the risk of chloride toxicity in shallow wetlands and lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												The process of ice formation in shallow waterbodies can increase chloride to toxic levels in waterbodies already impacted by chloride loading from road salt (NaCl deicer) application. Chloride concentrations were measured bi-weekly in a shallow, urban wetland in Madison, Wisconsin. We found that in this shallow waterbody, ice thickening doubled chloride concentrations from ion exclusion as the water froze. To understand the role of ice formation and ion exclusion, we constructed a numerical model to predict chloride concentrations beneath the ice resulting from ion exclusion. Where chloride levels already are elevated above background and flushing rates are low, ice thickening can push concentrations well above toxicity thresholds for much of the winter. The compounding effects of road salt runoff and ice formation should be considered in the management of water quality and ecosystem health in shallow urban water bodies or waterbodies receiving road salt runoff from nearby roadways.

The target compounds were analysed using developed offline solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC-PDA) method. All the five PPCPs were found in the influent, whereas four were found in the effluent of the STP. However, in the surface water bodies, three PPCPs were detected in all the seasons. Above PPCPs were present in the concentration range of 1-174 mu g L-1 in the surface water bodies, 12373 mu g L-1 in the influent and 11-233 mu g L-1 in the effluent of the STP. Amongst the five PPCPs, caffeine was found to be in higher concentration as compared to others. The seasonal trends indicate higher concentrations of PPCPs in summer season and lowest in the rainy season. Additionally, physico-chemical characterisations (inorganic and organic parameters) of the collected samples were performed to access the anthropogenic pollution. Ecotoxicological risk assessment was done to appraise the degree of toxicity of the targeted compounds.

J	Molnar, E; Maasz, G; Pirger, Z				Molnar, Eva; Maasz, Gabor; Pirger, Zsolt			Environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals at a seasonal holiday destination in the largest freshwater shallow lake in Central Europe	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The presence of pharmacologically active compounds (PhACs) in surface waters poses an environmental risk of chronic exposure to nontarget organisms, which is a well-established and serious concern worldwide. Our aim was to determine the temporal changes in ecological risk quotient (RQ) based on the concentrations of 42 PhACs from six sampling sites on seven sampling dates in the water of a freshwater lake in Central Europe preferentially visited by tourists. Our hypothesis was that the environmental risk increases during the summer holiday season due to the influence of tourists. Different experimental toxicological threshold concentrations and seasonal measured environmental concentrations of 16 PhACs were applied to ecological risk assessment. RQs of 4 dominant PhACs (diclofenac, estrone [E1], estradiol [E2], and caffeine) indicated high ecological risk (RQ > 1) for freshwater ecosystems. Additionally, our results confirmed the assumptions that the high tourist season had a significant impact on the calculated RQ; however, these results are mainly due to the concentration and temporal change of particular PhACs, including diclofenac (5.3-419.4 ng/L), E1 (0.1-5.5 ng/L), and E2 (0.1-19.6 ng/L). The seasonal dependent highest RQs changed as follows: 9.80 (June 2017; E2), 1.23 (August 2017; E1), 0.43 (November 2017; E1), 0.51 (April 2018; E1), 5.58 (June 2018, diclofenac), 39.50 (August 2018; diclofenac), and 30.60 (October 2018; diclofenac).

The site located at the base of the rookeries had total phosphorus values comparable to those reported from the most eutrophic Antarctic lakes. During the ice-free period most of the Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae recorded were concentrated at this site. Phytoplankton density increased strongly in the area opposite to the rookeries where ice began to form; an under-ice bloom of Ochromonas aff. ovalis (Chrysophyceae) was observed in this area.

J	NASLUND, I				NASLUND, I			THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULAR SEASONAL HABITAT SHIFTS IN A LANDLOCKED ARCTIC CHARR, SALVELINUS-ALPINUS L, POPULATION	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Parts of the Arctic charr populaton of the subarctic Lake Visjon in north-west Sweden migrate upstream during the spring to two small, recently eutrophied and very productive lakes. Large repeat migrants arrive first, followed by young first-time migrants. Charr in the small lakes grow more rapidly than those resident in L. Visjon. In early September mature fish leave the lakes, followed by immature fish later in September and in October. Overwintering and spawning takes place in L. Visjon. Migratory females attain maturity at age 4 years and resident females at age 6 years. The migrant fish return annually until they are 5-6 years old. This limit may be due to reduced relative growth benefits of the habitat shift for larger individuals. The rapid development of these regular habitat shifts could be explained by an internally fixed exploratory behaviour in these Arctic charr that makes the detection and utilization of distant feeding resources possible. Migrants will possess a considerably higher fitness, if survival rates for migratory and resident fish are equal.																				1095-8649				MAR	1990	36	3					401	414		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb05620.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb05620.x													WOS:A1990CX69600012

Growth and recruitment dynamics of young-of-year northern pike: Implications for habitat conservation and management	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Maximising growth during the months after hatching is critical for fishes to surpass predator gape limits, make ontogenetic shifts in diet and increase overwinter survival. Constraints on growth during early life stages can have population and community-level implications, yet are rarely addressed by habitat restoration or fishery management efforts. To assess environmental controls on larval growth rates, we sampled adult and young-of-year (YOY) northern pike (Esox lucius) emigrating from spawning grounds in six tributaries of Lake Michigan. We found that YOY growth rates differed significantly among natal streams, in parallel with variation in hatch date and water temperatures. Within each stream, individual growth rates were positively associated with trophic position, as measured by nitrogen isotope enrichment and gut contents. Earlier hatching individuals also grew faster, but the strength of this relationship varied with warming water temperatures (i.e., 21-27 degrees C). Ageing of adult spawners indicated no differences among streams in average growth rates later in life. Our findings suggest that restoration efforts should replicate ecological conditions found in habitats producing large numbers of fast-growing YOY. Key habitat attributes include adequate water level throughout the spring spawning season, and stable, warm water temperature conditions. Providing these environments during early life history could enhance the robustness of northern pike populations by boosting fitness from hatching to emigration to adult habitats.

Freshwater ostracods (Crustacea) and environmental variability of polygon ponds in the tundra of the Indigirka Lowland, north-east Siberia	POLAR RESEARCH												Freshwater ostracods (Crustacea, Ostracoda) are valuable biological indicators. In Arctic environments, their habitat conditions are barely known and the abundance and diversity of ostracods is documented only in scattered records with incomplete ecological characterization. To determine the taxonomic range of ostracod assemblages and their habitat conditions in polygon ponds in the Indigirka Lowland, north-east Siberia, we collected more than 100 living ostracod individuals per site with a plankton net (mesh size 65 mm) and an exhaustor system from 27 water bodies and studied them in the context of substrate and hydrochemical data. During the summer of 2011, a single pond site and its ostracod population was selected for special study. This first record of the ostracod fauna in the Indigirka Lowland comprises eight species and three additional taxa. Fabaeformiscandona krochini and F. groenlandica were documented for the first time in continental Siberia. Repeated sampling of a low-centre polygon pond yielded insights into the population dynamics of F. pedata. We identified air temperature and precipitation as the main external drivers of water temperatures, water levels, ion concentrations and water stable isotope composition on diurnal and seasonal scales.					; Schirrmeister, Lutz/O-5584-2015; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Pestryakova, Luidmila/Q-9900-2016; Wetterich, Sebastian/AAD-6569-2019	Wetterich, Sebastian/0000-0001-9234-1192; Schirrmeister, Lutz/0000-0001-9455-0596; Pestryakova, Luidmila/0000-0001-5347-4478; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; 													0800-0395	1751-8369					2016	35								25225	10.3402/polar.v35.25225	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/polar.v35.25225													WOS:000371024900001

The Nile perch fishery of Lake Victoria: current status and management challenges	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												The Nile perch, Lates niloticus (L.), stock in Lake Victoria may be showing signs of overfishing as the average size of fish decreased rapidly in 2007 when the stock biomass fell by 50%. Fishers have increasingly abandoned large-meshed gillnets in favour of small hooks on long lines. This has allowed prey species (Rastrineobola argentea [Pellegrin] and haplochromines) to increase, shifting the fishery to one dominated by species at lower trophic levels. These changes do not reflect deterioration in the environment because evidence suggests that conditions in the lake have improved and prey species sensitive to deoxygenation have increased. Management authorities have been criticised for relying only on the control of fishing effort rather than taking a holistic approach. However, fishing effort appears to be the main cause of the fishery problems and is the only aspect that can be controlled as environmental problems are too intractable.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				FEB	2015	22	1			SI		56	63		10.1111/fme.12084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12084													WOS:000348926700006
J	Jones, V; Solomina, O				Jones, Vivienne; Solomina, Olga			The geography of Kamchatka	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												This paper briefly reviews the physical and human geography of the Kamchatka region and summarises previous research on Holocene climate dynamics. We provide context for the rest of the Special Issue of the Journal Global and Planetary Change entitled 'Holocene climate change in Kamchatka', the primary focus of which is the use of lake sediment records for palaeoclimatic inferences. In this paper an additional perspective from ongoing tree ring, ice core and borehole temperature reconstructions illustrates that the Kamchatka region is rich in paleoclimatic proxies. The period of the last 200 years is sufficiently covered by the proxy information, including reconstructions with annual resolution. In this period the tree-rings, ice cores, boreholes, and glacier fluctuations recorded a 1 degrees C warming and a general glacier retreat, i.e. the transition from the Little Ice Age climate to the modern one. Although the proxies have different resolution, accuracy and seasonality in general they demonstrate a coherent picture of environmental changes in the last two centuries. The tree ring and ice core records are up to four-six hundred years long and they provide information on annual to decadal variability of summer temperature, accumulation processes, volcanic eruptions and lahar activity.

J	HEIDORN, KC				HEIDORN, KC			INCIDENTS OF ELEVATED NITRATE IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A study of nitrate in suspended particulate in the lower Great Lakes region of southern Ontario, Canada, during 1976-1977 indicated that elevated levels (in excess of 9.9 .mu.g m-3) occurred simultaneously across the region on certain days. These days most frequently fell within the cold season months of Oct.-March. The most common weather situation on these days was the presence of an anticyclone over, or to the east of, southern Ontario. Case studies of 3 periods in early 1977, during which widespread elevated nitrates occurred, showed nitrate levels to be dependent upon the previous history of the air mass. When back trajectories showed that the air mass had previously moved across the lower Great Lakes, nitrate levels were high. Low nitrate levels were most common when the air mass had moved across the upper Great Lakes. The low variability of nitrate concentration among the monitoring network and similar history of air mass movement indicates that long range transport is responsible for elevated ambient nitrate levels.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1979	12	4					417	429		10.1007/BF01046863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01046863													WOS:A1979JA89400002
J	Yang, CT; Nan, J; Li, JH				Yang, Changtao; Nan, Jing; Li, Jianhua			Driving Factors and Dynamics of Phytoplankton Community and Functional Groups in an Estuary Reservoir in the Yangtze River, China	WATER												Qingcaosha Reservoir, an estuary reservoir on the Yangtze River and a drinking water source, is facing phytoplankton blooms and the factors driving changes in phytoplankton composition and distribution have not been well understood so far. To facilitate the understanding of this problem, we collected surface water samples from January to December 2014 monthly at 12 sampling sites. A total of 205 taxa classified into eight major taxonomic groups were identified. Cyclotella meneghiniana, Melosira varians, Melosira granulata, Cryptomonas ovata and Chlorella vulgaris were the species dominating at least one season. The long stratification period and high nutrient concentration resulted in high chlorophyll a concentration (36.1 +/- 18.5 mu g L-1) in the midstream and downstream during summer, and mass phytoplankton growth and sedimentation process led to nutrients decrease. In the reservoir, neither P or N limitation was observed in the study period. We observed that water temperature, nutrient concentrations and light availability (Zeu/Zmix) are critical in selecting functional groups. These results highlight that the functional groups characterized the water body well and showed a good ecological status based on the assemblage index (Q average = 4.0). This work also highlights that mixing regime, water temperature and light availability were the driving factors that determine phytoplankton dynamics.					; Li, Jianhua/KEI-6539-2024	Yang, Changtao/0000-0003-3849-4141; 														2073-4441				JUN	2019	11	6							1184	10.3390/w11061184	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11061184													WOS:000475346300072

J	Nguetsop, VF; Servant-Vildary, S; Servant, M				Nguetsop, VF; Servant-Vildary, S; Servant, M			Late Holocene climatic changes in west Africa, a high resolution diatom record from equatorial Cameroon	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Holocene climatic changes in West Africa are usually explained by increased/decreased activity of the monsoon from the Guinean Gulf toward the continent. According to a diatom record from Lake Ossa (3degrees50'N, 9degrees36E), we suggest that, in the near coastal areas of Cameroon, phases of intensification of the monsoon were marked by reduced precipitation and reduced evaporation, conditions nowadays prevailing South of the equator (4 5degreesS) during the austral winter. Lake Ossa is a shallow lake located in one of the rainiest area of the African rain forest belt. During the wet season (March-November) it is fed by acid meteoric waters entailing low pH in the lacustrine waters. During the dry season (December-February) groundwater discharges allow the persistence of acid waters near the borders of the lake, but, in the inner parts, the waters tend to be alkaline, alkaliphilous diatoms are abundant in the surface sediment samples and are used as indicators of low precipitation. At that time, atmospheric dust containing reworked diatoms from Saharan Quaternary deposits is transported by the northern trade winds and reaches the Ossa area. Wind blown diatoms are considered as a signature of the northern trade winds. A diatom record from the western deep part of Lake Ossa has provided climatic data for the mid-late Holocene at a resolution of 50-60 years. A major climatic change at 2700 cat yr BP was marked by the appearance of wind blown diatoms. A millennial-scale alternation between low and high precipitation episodes is recorded during the last 5500 years. The low precipitation episodes before 2700cal yr BP are interpreted as a consequence of a northward extension of the climatic conditions that nowadays characterize the Southern Congo during the austral winter, when the monsoon extends into West Africa and reaches the northern sub-tropical latitudes. The effects of low precipitation on the water balance and on the rain forest were obliterated by an extremely low evaporation. Between 2700 and 1300 cat yr BP, precipitation was high and the rain forest intensively disturbed in response to convective storms. A low precipitation episode between 1300 and 600 cal yr BP is explained, contrarily to the previous similar episodes, by tropical rainfalls located farther South than today during a larger part of the year. The modern climate settles at about 600 cal yr BP. The climatic oscillations on a millennial time scale were apparently coincident with temperature changes in the Northern and Southern Atlantic suggesting that the monsoon over West Africa was essentially driven by interactions between both hemispheres. This interpretation is in agreement with available data from other equatorial and sub-tropical regions of West Africa. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The activities of Ra-226, Ra-228, Ra-223, and Ra-224 were measured in the Sea of Galilee, Israel, surrounding saline springs, and the Jordan River, coupled with U, Th, and Ra-226 measurements in sediment cores and laboratory Ra adsorption experiments under different salinity conditions. The Ra-226 activity (0.007-0.008 Bq L-1) and Ra-226 : Cl ratio in the lake were significantly lower than those of the inflowing saline springs, indicating that 75-86% of the incoming Ra-226 is removed from the lake water. This "missing" Ra is likely adsorbed onto suspended particles. Given the observed differential depletion of Ra isotopes, we present a model consisting of adsorption-desorption, recoil, and decay of the short-lived Ra-224 and Ra-223 isotopes. We predict a removal time of similar to 2 weeks for Ra, inferring the apparent residence time of suspended matter in the lake. A mass-balance calculation of the different Ra-226 inventories reveals a saline groundwater flux of 44-61 X 10(9) L yr(-1) for "Fuliya-type" water. The residence time of dissolved Ra-226 in the lake is estimated as 3-4 yr. The Ra-228 : Ra-226 ratio of the lake water and a mass-balance calculation show that Ra-228 arrives from regeneration though bottom sediments, in addition to groundwater flux. Mass-balance calculations of the expected saline fluxes before the diversion of saline inflows to the lake (early 1960s) provide 226Ra activity estimates in the lake (0.018-0.020 Bq L-1) that are similar to the value (0.018 +/- 0.0001 Bq L-1) measured in the lake in 1962.

They yield a significant palaeobiological record comprising fossil land plants and vertebrates and constitute the best available depositional record for a preliminary palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic analysis of the northeastern part of the Palaeogene southern Iberian Margin (western Tethys). Both lacustrine systems developed under similar warm and humid climatic conditions, increasingly affected by seasonal and/or pluriannual rhythms marked by changing precipitation patterns. These climatic conditions were mainly caused by the low palaeolatitude where the lacustrine systems evolved, the still probable although decreasing influence of Indo-Pacific warm surface currents, and the occurrence of very extensive marine water masses adjacent to wide, emerged continental zones. The Palaeogene lacustrine systems were shallow, and characterised by low gradient depositional conditions. They were perennial, open freshwater-oligosaline carbonate lakes where eutrophy, thermal meromixis and anoxic bottom conditions could develop, allowing the accumulation and preservation of macrophytic plant remains of the circum-lacustrine marginal belt and neighbouring terrestrial mesophytic zones. The higher plant/algal-bacterial organic contribution balance favoured the generation of mineable huminitic coal seams, carbominerites and of gas-prone, kerogene type III and Ilb source rocks. The hydrogen-bicarbonate-rich waters led to high biogenic and inorganic bio-induced carbonate sediment production. Biogenic muds, cyanobacterial incrustations and travertine and tufa precipitation constituted the major carbonate products. Moreover, the high pH conditions in the lacustrine water bodies and in the lacustrine sediment pore waters favoured bacterial sulphate reduction, contributing to organic sulphur enrichment in coals. These highly alkaline conditions also resulted, in some cases, in the exceptionally good preservation of chlorophyllinite, a rare liptinite maceral recorded in the Eocene coal deposits. The Middle Eocene lacustrine system did not evolve in a very well defined tectonic setting, characterised by the generation of low uplifts and gently subsiding basins. Terrigenous contributions from the source areas and clastic sedimentation were restricted to river mouths. High autochthonous carbonate production and accumulation characterised most of the remaining lacustrine zones. A significant spring recharge of the lacustrine zones is suggested by the well developed spring related travertine deposits. By contrast, the Oligocene lacustrine zones developed both in fluvial-related floodplains and in the distal zones of a major alluvial system, which was fed from tectonically active source areas located to the NW of the island. A more significant water runoff contribution is suggested for this system although underground recharge could also be substantial. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In waters where attenuation was strongly affected by yellow substance absorption, the built-in correction was shown not to be satisfactory, and could sometimes produce parabolical backscattering spectra. The backscattering spectra corrected with the "quick and dirty" method could be divided into three groups, each belonging to different geographical regions of Lake Malaren.																					2-908885-22-0				1998							221	228																WOS:000166270600026

Overview of the LADCO winter nitrate study: hourly ammonia, nitric acid and PM2.5 composition at an urban and rural site pair during PM2.5 episodes in the US Great Lakes region	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												An overview of the LADCO (Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium) Winter Nitrate Study (WNS) is presented. Sampling was conducted at ground level at an urban-rural pair of sites during January-March 2009 in eastern Wisconsin, toward the western edge of the US Great Lakes region. Areas surrounding these sites experience multiday episodes of wintertime PM2.5 pollution characterized by high fractions of ammonium nitrate in PM, low wind speeds, and air mass stagnation. Hourly surface monitoring of inorganic gases and aerosols supplemented long-term 24-h aerosol chemistry monitoring at these locations. The urban site (Milwaukee, WI) experienced 13 PM2.5 episodes, defined as periods where the seven-hour moving average PM2.5 concentration exceeded 27 mu g m(-3) for at least four consecutive hours. The rural site experienced seven episodes by the same metric, and all rural episodes coincided with urban episodes. Episodes were characterized by low pressure systems, shallow/stable boundary layer, light winds, and increased temperature and relative humidity relative to climatological mean conditions. They often occurred in the presence of regional snow cover at temperatures near freezing, when snow melt and sublimation could generate fog and strengthen the boundary layer inversion. Substantial contribution to nitrate production from nighttime chemistry of ozone and NO2 to N2O5 and nitric acid is likely and requires further investigation. Pollutant-specific urban excess during episode and non-episode conditions is presented. The largest remaining uncertainties in the conceptual model of the wintertime episodes are the variability from episode-to-episode in ammonia emissions, the balance of daytime and nighttime nitrate production, the relationship between ammonia controls, NOx controls and ammonium nitrate reductions, and the extent to which snow and fog are causal (either through meteorological or chemical processes) rather than just correlated with episodes because of similar synoptic meteorology.

J	MICHALSKI, J; LEMMIN, U				MICHALSKI, J; LEMMIN, U			DYNAMICS OF VERTICAL MIXING IN THE HYPOLIMNION OF A DEEP LAKE - LAKE GENEVA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Based on 6 yr of high-resolution temperature profiles taken monthly in the 300-m-deep Lake Geneva (Lac Leman), we examine the hypothesis that vertical mixing is the dominant mixing mechanism in the hypolimnion. Using the flux gradient method, we estimate vertical turbulent mixing coefficients K-z for periods of 1 month, the summer warming season, and over the multiannual continuous heating trend observed in the lake. The hypolimnion can be divided into two distinct layers: above 90 m and below 90 m. A correlation between K-z and the Brunt-Vaisala frequency N-2 is found in the upper hypolimnion down to similar to 90 m, indicating that wind-induced vertical mixing is dominant there. Once a thermocline has developed at a depth of similar to 20 m the heat gain below 90 m becomes very small, and stratification there is stronger than in the bottom layers of shallow lakes. In the deep hypolimnion we observed large-scale temperature inversions and intrusions, suggesting that mixing is noncontinuous and cannot be adequately described by vertical mixing alone.																			0024-3590					JUN	1995	40	4					809	816		10.4319/lo.1995.40.4.0809	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.4.0809													WOS:A1995RM27700017

Chlorophyll-a, ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-), ortho-phosphate (PO4-3) analyses were conducted. Trophic status was detected according to Carlson Trophic Index and OECD criteria. According to the findings; the highest chlorophyll-a average value was reached in autumn with 39.1 mu g/L. Secchi-disc value varied between minimum 26 cm and maximum 312 cm. Correlation coefficient among secchi-disc and chlorophyll-a values was -0.4. Water temperature was minimum 11.7 degrees C and maximum 29.5 degrees C. Amonnium values were minimum 0.13 mWL and maximum 1.35 mg/L. Nitrite values were minimum 0 mg/L and maximum 0.025 mg/L. Nitrate values were minimum 0 mg/L and maximum 1.80 mg/L. Ortho-phosphate value was minimum 0 mWL and maximum 1.16 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen was minimum 5.2 mg/L and maximum 10.7 mg/L. pH value was minimum 7.08 and maximum 8.53. Electrical conductivity (EC) was minimum 472 mu mhos/cm, maximum 588 mu mhos/cm. A total of 37 phytoplankton and 19 zooplankton taxa were determined. Of these, 7 belong to Cyanobacteria, 12 to Ochrophyta, 5 to Charophyta, 8 to Chlorophyta, 2 to Dinoflagellata, 2 to Cryptophyta, 1 to Euglenozoa, 11 to Rotifera, 5 to Crustacea and 3 to Protozoa.

J	PERSSON, L				PERSSON, L			THE EFFECTS OF RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND DISTRIBUTION ON SIZE CLASS INTERACTIONS IN PERCH, PERCA-FLUVIATILIS	OIKOS												The relationships between foraging efficiencies and prey species and size were investigated in laboratory and field studies of the perch, Perca fluviatilis. When fed Daphnia in the laboratory, small perch (one year old, 1+) had both a higher capture rate and a lower handling time than large perch (two year old, 2+). When perch were fed Cyclops no significant effect of age class on capture rate was found. Large perch had a higher capture rate than small perch when feeding on chironomids and Sialis and a lower handling time when feeding on Sialis. Although the capture rate of chironomids at low prey densities was greater for 2+ perch than for 1+ perch, the lower metabolic demands of 1+ perch enabled them to obtain a higher net energy intake. Due to their lower metabolic demands and higher capture rate when fed cladocerans in the laboratory, small perch were predicted to have a higher competitive ability in the pelagic habitat of lakes. This prediction was verified in a field experiment as 1+ perch had both a higher growth rate and a greater ability to withstand resource depression. When alone 1+ and 2+ perch utilized the same food resources, but when they co-existed, their diets differed. The superior competitive ability of 1+ perch in the pelagic habitat is probably responsible for the previously observed age-class, habitat segregation that occurs in the summer during periods of low food availability. The tendency for perch populations to become stunted is most likely due to the large pelagic and small littoral zones in many lakes as well as the higher temperature during the summer. Both of these factors favour smaller perch.

In the case of Gallocanta Lake, its seasonality and shallow depth (less than 2 m) allow us to appreciate the variations in the aquatic vegetation with the apparent color. Six common vegetation indices were tested, and the one with the best response was the so-called NDI45, which uses the normalized ratio between the far red (705 nm) and red (665 nm) bands. Our aims are to show the variations in the surface area covered by vegetation at the bottom of the lagoon, its growth and disappearance when drying occurs, and recolonization in a flooding period. The degree of cover reaches 90% at the most favorable times of the year, generally in summer and coinciding with flooding of the lake. The studied period shows how this method can be used for lacustrine habitat detection and highlights the need for field vegetation inventories in future works, which will allow the spectral measurements to be related to the species present.

Diseased fish showed signs of respiratory distress, mainly during hot days. Physiochemical pond water parameters were normal, except dissolved oxygen was lower than the optimum level. Livoneca redmanii (Cymotidae, Isopoda) was isolated from the gill chamber of infested fish. The infestation percent was 41 and 33%, and the intensity was 1.146 and 1.06 in the first and second ponds, respectively. The diseased fingerlings were infested in the natural habitat (Mediterranean Sea) before collection for culture. L. redmanii infestation was associated with high economic losses due to direct fish mortality, reduced growth rates and lower condition factor. The molecular study confirmed the presence of L. redmanii based on the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA and COI gene sequences. Infested fish gills showed massive destruction in gill filaments, sloughing and curling of secondary gill lamellae with the detachment of the cartilaginous core supporting the primary gill filaments. Deltamethrin and trichlorfon effectively eradicated L. redmanii at concentrations of 12.5 mu g.l- 1 and 0.5 mg.l-1, respectively. The lowest detectable deltamethrin residue in treated pond water was 2.18 mu g.l- 1 at 120 h, with a half-life of 47.63 h.

Exogenously produced CO2 doubles the CO2 efflux from three north temperate lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												It is well established that lakes are typically sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, it remains unclear what portion of CO2 efflux is from endogenously processed organic carbon or from exogenously produced CO2 transported into lakes. We estimated high-frequency CO2 and O-2 efflux from three north temperate lakes in summer to determine the proportion of the total CO2 efflux that was exogenously produced. Two of the lakes were amended with nutrients to experimentally enhance endogenous CO2 uptake. In the unfertilized lake, 50% of CO2 efflux was from exogenous sources and hydrology had a large influence on efflux. In the fertilized lakes, endogenous CO2 efflux was negative (into the lake) yet exogenous CO2 made the lakes net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. Shifts in hydrologic regimes and nutrient loading have the potential to change whether small lakes act primarily as reactors or vents in the watershed.					; Cole, Jonathan/G-4566-2011; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; Buelo, Cal/0000-0001-7909-1440; Wilkinson, Grace/0000-0003-4051-2249; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 16	2016	43	5					1996	2003		10.1002/2016GL067732	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL067732													WOS:000373109800026
J	Zingel, P; Noges, T				Zingel, Priit; Noges, Tiina			Protozoan grazing in shallow macrophyte- and plankton lakes	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The aim of the present study was to describe the role of ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates in macrophyte and phytoplankton dominated shallow lakes and to compare the grazing on pico- and nano-sized particles by these protozoans. We sampled three shallow takes, seasonally, one dominated by macrophytes, one by phytoplankton, and one with both conditions (two basins of this lake were sampled separately). The role of ciliates as consumers of bacteria and small algae was important in both lake types. In plankton dominated lakes the grazing rate of ciliates on bacteria was higher than in macrophyte dominated ones. But when ciliates were grazing on small algae, the highest rates were found in macrophyte lakes. Our results suggest that the microbial loop is weaker in macrophyte dominated lakes and grows stronger, when a lake becomes more turbid. The dominance of herbivorous ciliates in macrophyte lakes in summer and their high grazing rates on phytoplankton may have contributed to the decrease in phytoplankton abundance in these lakes. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates were relatively less abundant and, due to their low specific filtering rates, grazed only a minor fraction of the bacterioplankton.

Most studies have found either N or P to be primarily limiting. A nutrient-diffusing bioassay was used to determine if N, P, neither nutrient, or both nutrients were limiting to periphyton growth (measured by chlorophyll a) in 6 tributaries to Lake Superior during the ice-free season of 1994. Molar ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus (DIN:SRP) were also calculated to predict potential limitation conditions and determine agreement with bioassay results. Go-limitation predominated (N + P > all other treatments). No limitation was also common during the late portion of the ice-free season. DIN: SRP ratios were not useful in predicting nutrient-limitation conditions. Results showed that nutrient limitation of periphyton biomass varied over space and time on a relatively small regional scale. This result is significant because many studies extrapolate results from a single stream or time period to a much larger spatial or temporal scale.																			0887-3593					MAR	1999	18	1					2	14		10.2307/1468005	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468005													WOS:000080684900002

The Terminal Carbonate Complex (TCC) is a late Messinian carbonate platform system that recorded western Mediterranean hydrological changes from the final stages of evaporite deposition till the advent of Lago-Mare fresh- to brackish water conditions at the very end of Messinian times. A multidisciplinary study has been carried out in three localities in south-eastern Spain to reconstruct the history of TCC platforms and elucidate their significance in the MSC. Overall, this study provides evidence that the TCC formed following a regional 4th order water level rise and fall concomitant with an opening-restriction trend. It can be subdivided into four 5th order depositional sequences (DS1 to DS4) recording two phases: (1) from DS1 to DS3, a tide-dominated ooidic to oobioclastic system with stenohaline faunas developed as a result of a 70 m water level rise. During this period, the TCC developed in a shallow sea with close to normal marine salinity; (2) in depositional sequence 4, a microbialite-dominated platform system developed. This is indicative of a significant environmental change and is attributed to a 30 to 40 m water level fall in the basins under study. These restricted conditions were coeval with intense evaporite deformation and brine recycling. The syn-sedimentary deformation of evaporites had a major impact on platform architecture and carbonate production, affecting the Messinian series throughout south-eastern Spain at the end of the TCC history. At that time, the TCC developed in a lake with fluctuating, brackish- to hypersaline water. These findings suggest a temporary restoration of marine conditions in the western Mediterranean marginal basins due to Atlantic water influxes prompted by a global sea level rise around 5.6 Ma. Whether marine conditions extended to the entire western Mediterranean still needs to be investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Logarithms of rate constants for all deep samples and for surface and epilimnetic samples in opaque bags were proportional to temperature, with degradation occurring more slowly than was estimated by (1958). Detoxification of surface samples in clear bags was in good agreement with Post''s findings, indicating that light plays an important role in detoxification of surface waters.

We examined the distributions of fossil midge (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages in the surface sediments of 54 south-central Ontario lakes and, using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), determined if fossil chironomid assemblages could be used to reconstruct levels of hypolimnetic anoxia in thermally stratifying Laurentian Shield lakes. Anoxia was expressed as the anoxic factor (AF), which represents the days per season that a sediment area equal to a lake's surface area is overlain by anoxic water. Forward selection in CCA showed that AF, maximum depth, [SO4] [Na], and watershed area all explained significant portions of species variation. A weighted-averaging regression and calibration model of the chironomid-anoxia relationship was developed which suggests that it is possible to infer AF from fossil chironomid assemblages ((r(appar)(2)) = 0.70, bootstrapped RMSE = 6.5 days/summer). Quantitative reconstruction of past changes in anoxia using fossil Chironomidae should provide a new and useful tool for paleoecological assessments of lake ecosystems.

DOC showed similar vertical distributions in all the lakes in summer when thermal stratification occurred. DOC in the epilimnion was higher than the value of 0.8 mg Cl-1 found in the hypolimnion. In three Japanese lakes, hypolimnion DOC was negatively correlated with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), reflecting the net oxidation of DOC using the dissolved oxygen in lake water. The DOC:O-2 ratios (0.1150-0.179), calculated by the slopes of the regression lines of DOC versus AOU in hypolimnion water, were as low as those of deep-sea water, which indicates low bioavailability of lake water DOC for heterotrophic bacteria. DOC and conductivity did not correlate well except in two Japanese lakes: one showed a positive correlation and the other a negative correlation, indicating DOC loading from the inflowing rivers. Eutrophic lakes tended to have higher DOC values than meso- and oligotrophic lakes, and DOC values in the surface water negatively correlated with Secchi depths.																			1439-8621					DEC	2004	5	3					165	176		10.1007/s10201-004-0128-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-004-0128-3													WOS:000225778000005

The formation is characterized by large volumes of volcaniclastics supplied passively by pyroclastic fall. Facies analysis reveals that this formation consists mostly of lacustrine delta deposits with minor alluvial fan deposits at its base. The conspicuous occurrence of a flood plain facies with infrequent channel fill deposits in the lower part of this formation suggest that the drainage area was limited in the early stage of deposition. Pyroclastic fall would therefore have been an important source of sediment during the early stages of rift development. The delta deposits are divided into two distinct successions based on lithological characteristics, separated by a thick pyroclastic layer in the middle part of the formation. The stacking pattern of the lower succession is retrogradational, whereas the upper succession is characterized by a pile of prograding bodies. Both delta successions are interpreted to have accumulated in an underfilled basin. The change in depositional mode from the lower to upper is considered to be due to a change in the balance between the sedimentation rate and the rate of lake-level rise. Assuming constant sediment supply, the apparent difference in flooding scale between the lower and upper successions is attributed to the topographical widening of the basin flat. Similar successions also occur in another basin in the East African Rift (Ngorora Formation, central Kenya), in which pyroclastic sediments are dominant and upward decrease in sedimentation rate is recognized. The differing in the stacking patterns between the Namurungule Formation and the Ngorora formation is probably induced by basin width. The narrow Namurungule basin seems to have been sensitive to increased sediment supply owing to the expansion of the catchment area. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Interbasin groundwater flow is often identified among watersheds. Because geological systems are complex ones, modelling tools are needed for its estimation. In this paper, we quantify the outflows from the endhoreic Gallocanta watershed (Spain) by means of a MODFLOW numerical model in order to assess the robustness of the boundaries of the Gallocanta Groundwater Body. Our results show the Gallocanta watershed is hydrogeologically connected with the adjoining Piedra-Ortiz and Jiloca watersheds (discharging annually in these basins about 4 and 1 Mm3 respectively). Furthermore, we hypothesized the presence of geological features altering the groundwater flow. Additional simulations were run to analyse the changes in the water budget in the cases of: i) groundwater pumping no longer allowed by the authorities, and ii) a potential drought scenario. In the first case, the results forecast an increase in discharge to the Piedra-Ortiz and Jiloca watersheds, while in the second case a diminution of the outflows to the two neighboring basins is foreseen.We then propose a larger and unique groundwater body, spanning from the Caminreal Springs on the east and the Piedra-Ortiz basin on the west, including a moving groundwater divide internal to the Gallocanta watershed. Monitoring the baseflow of the Piedra-Ortiz river and of the Caminreal Springs will allow to get information on the evolution of the groundwater resource availability in the Gallocanta watershed. Our results stress the importance of conjunctively using data and traditional geologic knowledge (i.e. surface geology maps) along with numerical modelling analyses. This holds especially true in areas, such those of hard-rock aquifers, where scarce hydrogeologic data are available, to test conceptual models, to derive and to infer information on water budgets and on the presence of relevant structural features driving the groundwater flow. This approach may lead to informed decision-making on groundwater body boundaries definition for the application of relevant groundwater management regulations.

An understanding of circulation and mixing processes are essential to assess the fate and transport of water quality constituents in Hamilton Harbour. Water level measurements showed that in addition to harbour and lake seiches, the Helholtz mode, due to pumping action from Lake Ontario, is important in generating harbour water movements while the circulation patterns in the open waters of the harbour are influenced by prevailing winds. In general, the mean summer circulation consists of two counter-rotating gyres occupying the harbour. Hamilton Harbour physical processes are further characterized by substantial water exchanges with Lake Ontario. These exchange flows play a major role in determining the retention time of the harbour, thereby exerting a large influence on water quality, including hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2016	19	2			SI		114	123		10.1080/14634988.2016.1165035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2016.1165035													WOS:000378052300004

Septal ultrastructure in R. capitatum was similar to that of species of Tilletia, Filobasidium, and Filobasidiella; it is a primitive type of dolipore rather than the simple pore found in other species of Rhodosporidium. Septal ultrastructure appears to be correlated with promycelial type and physiological characteristics.

J	HORNE, AJ				HORNE, AJ			NITROGEN REMOVAL FROM WASTE TREATMENT POND OR ACTIVATED-SLUDGE PLANT EFFLUENTS WITH FREE-SURFACE WETLANDS	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					2nd IAWQ International Specialist Conference on Waste Stabilization Ponds and the Reuse of Pond Effluents	DEC   03, 1993	OAKLAND, CA	Int Assoc Water Qual, Univ Calif Berkeley				Due to their dynamic mode of operation, waste treatment pond and activated sludge plant effluents always contain quite large amounts of nitrogen relative to those found in natural lakes, streams, and oceans. Typical activated sludge plant effluents contain 25 mgl(-1) N, mostly as ammonia. In most aquatic milieux, concentrations of ammonia > 1 mgl(-1) N are potentially toxic to fish and other wildlife. Nitrification and denitrification of activated sludge plant effluent alleviates the ammonia problem at a considerable cost but the discharges still usually contain over 10 mgl(-1) NO3-N which exceeds the WHO standard for drinking water. A great advantage of waste treatment pond effluents is that nitrogen is normally already present as nitrate or particulate-N (algae and bacteria), and nitrate concentrations are < 5 mgl(-1) NO3-N. However, even 1 mgl(-1) of nitrate-N is sufficient to cause eutrophication in unpolluted lakes, streams, and oceans and some of the particulate-N discharged will be recycled to give eutrophication downstream. Where sufficient diluting water is available, these higher effluent concentrations are not a problem. Unfortunately, clean diluting water is becoming a scarce commodity in many areas, particularly the 17 semi-arid states in We USA and in most developing countries where rainfall is needed for drinking water and wildlife support. One solution for nitrogen removal is new design for free surface constructed wetlands which have considerable potential for nitrogen polishing of waste treatment pond effluents. Particulate-N can be removed by using wetlands as large filters but the nitrogen often recycles and is released as ammonia in winter and spring. Denitrification of nitrate to N-2 gas removes the problem permanently. In particular, the relatively low BOD, high nitrate and low ammonia effluent from some stabilization ponds is ideal for nitrate removal (denitrification) by free surface wetlands. Rates of nitrate removal of 200 to over 5,000 mg N m(-2) d(-1) can be achieved with initial nitrate values of 2-14 mgl(-1) NO3-N. These rates are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than occur in most natural lake, estuarine or wetlands sediments and can be mostly attributed to denitrification rather than growth of rooted plants. In two weeks 20 mgl(-1) NO3-N can be reduced to less than 1 mgl(-1). After wetlands treatment the water is suitable for release into water-depleted live streams or lakes where a low eutrophication potential is vital for native biota. it is recommended that pond effluent be routed thorough constructed wetlands whenever possible since both better water quality and wildlife benefits occur.																			0273-1223						1995	31	12					341	351		10.2166/wst.1995.0503	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1995.0503													WOS:A1995TG76900037
J	Skoulikidis, NT				Skoulikidis, NT			Hydrochemical character and spatiotemporal variations in a heavily modified river of western Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												A 22-year series of monthly hydrochemical data from the Acheloos River in western Greece, which flows through four reservoirs, was analysed in order to assess and interpret its hydrochemical regime, spatial differentiations, seasonal variations and interannual trends. The data set was controlled for its quality and gaps in measurements were filled by a formula, developed for that purpose. The river's composition is attributed to rock weathering, precipitation quantity and quality, catchment altitude and in-lake biological activity. Regarding nutrients, organic carbon and dissolved oxygen, the water quality is good. Downstream of the last large impoundment, the river behaves as a heavily modified water body, with minimum solute concentrations in summer. Further downstream, the seasonal hydrochemical regime tends towards a natural one. Interannual climate variations influence water composition significantly. In dry-warm year periods evapotranspiration processes 'concentrate' reservoir water, enhance salt accumulation in soil pores and contribute to a mineralization of Acheloos River water.

J	Laybourn-Parry, J; Marshall, WA				Laybourn-Parry, J; Marshall, WA			Photosynthesis, mixotrophy and microbial plankton dynamics in two high Arctic lakes during summer	POLAR BIOLOGY												Photosynthesis and microbial plankton dynamics of two lakes in the Kongsfjorden catchment of Spitzbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, 78degreesN) were investigated during the summer of 2000. One of the lakes (Tvillingvatnet) served as the water supply for the village of Ny Angstromlesund. The other was a deeper, larger unnamed lake in the Ossian Sarsfjella reserve-named Lake OS in this study. Both lakes can be classified as oligotrophic on the basis of chlorophyll a and inorganic nutrient concentrations. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged between 0.33 and 1.65 mug l(-1) in Tvillingvatnet and 0.2 and 0.3 mug l(-1) in Lake OS. The phytoplankton was dominated by chrysophytes and cryptophytes, with the diatom Rhizosolenia and a number of dinoflagellate species. Rates of photosynthesis were typically low, between 24.5 mug and 1.0 mg l(-1) day(-1) in Tvillingvatnet (photosynthetic efficiency 0.004-0.26), and between 3.1 and 29.5 mug l(-1) day (-1) in Lake OS (photosynthetic efficiency 0.0019-0.0085). Among the phytoflagellates (PNAN) there were a number of mixotrophs which reached their peaks of abundance before other PNAN. Mixotrophy appeared to provide a competitive advantage. Grazing rates for the mixotroph Dinobryon ranged between 0.063 and 1.12 pg C cell(-1) day(-1) in Lake OS and between 0.22 and 1.11 pg cell(-1) day(-1) in Tvillingvatnet, with rates increasing between July and August. However, Dinobryon removed less than 1% of bacterial biomass day(-1), while the heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) removed up to 28% of bacterial biomass day(-1). Bacterial concentrations were low, with a maximum of 28.8x10(8) l(-1) in Tvillingvatnet and 23.6x10(8) l(-1) in Lake OS. Ciliated protozoan and rotifer diversity in the plankton was low.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2003	26	8					517	524		10.1007/s00300-003-0514-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-003-0514-z													WOS:000184325800004

The results show that the decrease in temperature is large in Tibet and Eastern Asia at 21 ka. The amplitudes of the decrease vary with seasons and locations. Annual mean temperature decreases between 13 degreesC and 2 degreesC. Summer and annual precipitation in eastern China at 21 ka is only about 50% of that at present; while little more or unchanged precipitation appears in northwest, west and southwest of China. The effective precipitation (P-E) shows much drier conditions in eastern and southeastern China than today. A comparison with geological evidences of lake-status and pollen-based vegetation shows that this simulation is in broad scale agreement with the geological records. The changes by using palaeo-vegetation data to prescribe land surface show improved signals in the 21 ka climate simulations in East Asia. This result encourages us to study the potential causes, feedbacks and mechanisms of palaeoclimate changes using the AGCM+SSiB modelling approach continuously.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	2002	19	7					575	583		10.1007/s00382-002-0248-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-002-0248-6													WOS:000178145700002

Energy allocation strategies of young temperate fish: an eco-genetic modeling approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We use an individual-based eco-genetic model to explore the relative selective pressures of size-dependent predation, overwinter mortality, and density-dependent energy acquisition in structuring plastic and adaptive energy allocation during the first year of life of a temperate fish population. While several patterns emerging from a suite of eco-genetic model simulations were consistent with past theoretical models and empirical evaluations of energy allocation by young fishes, results also highlight the utility of eco-genetic models for simultaneous consideration of plastic and adaptive processes. Across simulations, variation in genetic control of energy allocation was limited during very early ontogeny when size-dependent predation pressure was particularly high. While this stabilizing selection on energy allocation diminished later in the growing season, predation, overwinter mortality, and density-dependent processes simultaneously structured energy partitioning later in ontogeny through the interactive influence of plastic and adaptive processes. Specifically, high risk of overwinter mortality and low predation selected for high prioritization of energy storage. We suggest that simulations demonstrate the utility of eco-genetic models for generating null predictions of how selective pressures may structure expression of life history traits, such as early life energy allocation.

Phototrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton abundance differed by less than an order of magnitude and was typically present at densities of 103 cells .cntdot. mL-1. Heterotrophic nanoplankton was, on average, only half as abundant as phototrophic nanoplankton, but on several dates was more abundant than the latter. Both populations peaked in late June to early July. Phototrophic picoplankton, primarily chroococcoid cyanobacteria, increased rapidly during midsummer, reaching a maximum epilimnetic concentration of 4 .times. 105 cells .cntdot. mL-1 in late August. Heterotrophic picoplankton (bacteria) showed a similar seasonal pattern, reaching maximum abundance in September (6 .times. 106) cells .cntdot. mL-1. The concentrations of both picoplankton populations were significantly correlated with temperature. By late summer, picoplankton biomass represented 74% and pico-cyanobacteria alone 50% of the total weight biomass of microorganisms < 20 .mu.m; these populations are generally missed by inverted microscope techniques.

Nodularia blooms have caused several animal kills in the Baltic Sea area, and NODLN has been found in mussels and fish caught from the northern Baltic Sea in 1996 to 2002. We analyzed liver samples of common eider (Somateria mollissima) for NODLN by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Eiders feed extensively on mussel and can be exposed to NODLN by contaminated mussels. Fifteen ciders were shot and collected from three different sites in the western Gulf of Finland (northern Baltic Sea) in August and September 2002. Analyses by ELISA and LC-MS showed that eider liver samples contained 3 to 180 mug NODLN/kg dry weight and 0.1 to 5.8 mug NODLN/liver (dry wt). This is the first documentation of NODLN in seabirds and additional evidence for the transfer of NODLN in different parts of the Baltic Sea food web.

Foraging morphology and diet divergence of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) in water courses of Murmansk region	LIMNOLOGICA												European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) is a highly polymorphic species. In general, it is assumed that the divergence in whitefish is a form of a specialization in the use of the resources (including food) of the main limnological zones - pelagic (plankton), littoral (benthos, plankton), profundal (benthos) - and the morpho-logical adaptations of the shape of the body and head simultaneously determine the direction of the process. The shape and number of gill rakers, which are responsible in whitefish for prey retention, are considered the most important adaptive trait and are most often used to distinguish between its sympatric morphs or ecotypes. Current study will be devoted to foraging morphology and diet divergence of whitefish in water courses of Murmansk region. Our study of the water bodies in three major river basins of Murmansk region revealed the presence of two whitefish morphs: sparsely rakered (further sr) and medium rakered (mr). The mr morph is less common and observed only alongside the sr whitefish. In general, in sr whitefish the number of gill rakers ranges between 15 and 31, and in mr whitefish between 27 and 44. Among whitefishes with 27-31 gill rakers, both sr and mr morphs were observed and distinguishable by the shape of the rakers. In the studied sr whitefish pop-ulations, relatively long and short rakered whitefish morphs were found. In Lake Kuetsja center dot rvi (Pasvik River basin), the sr and mr whitefish formed additional slow-and fast-growing ecological morphs. In the water bodies of the Murmansk region, the greatest diversity of sympatric morphs of whitefish (from two - sr and dr to four morphs - sr1, sr2, mr1, mr2) is observed in the most polluted water bodies with higher productivity and a large abundance of such generalists as perch and European smelt. The diet of sr and mr whitefish morphs in the studied water bodies of Murmansk region in summer-autumn period is associated with hydrobiological features of fish habitats. Sr whitefish morph from the Pasvik, Tuloma and Niva Rivers basins, inhabiting mainly littoral and profundal areas of water bodies, have a benthic diet. Mr whitefish morph, inhabiting mainly littoral and pelagic areas of water bodies, have both benthic and mixed feeding types. According to our data, coexistence of four morphs of whitefish in Lake Kuetsja center dot rvi (lower Pasvik River) - sr1, mr1, sr2 and mr2 have the low specialization and use the most abundant recourses in lake. The most extensive overlapping of feeding spectra is found in small morphs in Lake Kuetsja center dot rvi - sr1 and mr1. On the basis of our data on whitefish from water bodies of Murmansk region we found active gill apparatus functioning in fish, as minimum length of food organisms in sr and mr whitefish morphs were sometimes less than or equal to gill rakers distances of fish.

We tested whether low-level cadmium and reduced calcium intake affect tissue cadmium concentrations and behaviour of captive black ducks. Adults received diets that mimicked cadmium and calcium concentrations in invertebrate prey from acid and from circumneutral wetlands for three spring and slimmer months in 1991 and 1992. Behaviours were monitored both when birds were fed experimental diets and control (commercial) diets. Cadmium in kidneys and liver differed significantly among groups and low calcium facilitated cadmium uptake. After two breeding seasons, levels of accumulated Cd were not lethal. However, birds that received Cd were significantly more active than control birds. Increased activity may have implications for survival of birds in the wild.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1995	90	2					153	161		10.1016/0269-7491(94)00102-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(94)00102-J								15091480					WOS:A1995RP93200003
J	Xiao, CD; Su, B; Wang, XM; Qin, DH				Xiao, Cunde; Su, Bo; Wang, Xiaoming; Qin, Dahe			Cascading risks to the deterioration in cryospheric functions and services	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												The cryosphere provides a wide range of benefits to human well-being, directly or indirectly and materially or spiritually. They are defined as cryosphere services, including provisioning, regulating, culture, bearing and supporting services. All cryospheric services are supported by cryospheric functions reflected in their processes, structures and properties. Examples may include energy regulation, mass (especially water) storage and transfer, load support, natural cooling, and protection from surface erosion etc. However, as a result of climate warming and corresponding cryosphere shrinkage, the cryosphere functions and their associated services have been deteriorating and would continue or be eventually lost. These are highlighted by the following aspects. Firstly, the meltwater provisioned by glaciers starts to decline once their overall mass is reduced to a tipping point, which indicates the time when the accelerated melting glaciers due to climate warming can no longer supplement the declining meltwater due to the reduction in glacier mass. Meanwhile, before reaching the tipping point, the increase in glacier meltwater causes water discharge becoming more extreme, leading to floods, while the reduced meltwater after the tipping point may exacerbate the likelihood of droughts. The deteriorated freshwater provisioning function and service could pose a serious threat to regional social and ecological systems, especially in the High Asia and Andes of South America, where the increasing population highly depends on cryospheric water supply. Secondly, with the relinquishing cryosphere following warming climate, the cryosphere is gradually losing cooling capacity and incurring reduced albedo, consequently exposing the underlying surface to absorb more and more heat that accelerates the shrinking of the cryosphere. The ocean circulation could be weakened due to increased meltwater of glaciers and sea ices, which increases the volume of freshwater at sea surface and prevent thermohaline circulation at high latitudes. The declining climate regulating function and service of the cryosphere would cause more frequent extreme weather events, such as rapid warming in the Arctic that would significantly weaken polar vortex, affecting mid- and low-latitude circulations that may bring more frequent heat waves in summer and extreme cold events in winter. Thirdly, the cryosphere would gradually lose its water storage (e.g. melting glaciers) and incur land erosion (e.g. thaw slump) following warming climate. The accelerated retreat of the fast ice along coasts of the Arctic Ocean increases the seasonal exposure of coastlines to the impact of waves. Together with the deterioration of frozen ground, the Arctic coasts world experience accelerated erosion. In permafrost regions, the thaw slumps and thermokarst lakes are also the consequences of increased temperature in the cryosphere. These may eventually cause the release of greenhouse gases and further exacerbate climate warming. Finally, landscapes in the cryosphere would become more fragmented and even lost. Correspondingly, those associated cultural functions together with the services, such as aesthetic and recreational uses, religious and spiritual activities, would all be impacted. It would not only seriously affect people's needs, but also impact on local communities. In addition, the livelihood and culture of indigenous people, especially in the Arctic, would be afflicted. The decrease or loss of cryosphere services can also create cascading risks in the eco-socioeconomic systems. It mainly includes: (1) the arid regions relying on cryospheric meltwater resources will face following- on risks such as water conflicts and climate refugees; (2) the subsequent risks in agriculture and public health may increase due to more frequent extreme weather and climate; (3) following on the deterioration of soil and water conservation functions, there would be risks of degrading eco-system and socioeconomic assets. In the case of more lost carbon sinks or even changes to carbon sources, it would more or less affect the implementation of "Paris Agreement"; (4) there are risks of the disappearance of unique cryosphere cultures, further impacting on culture diversity. Therefore, the cascading risks as a result of cryosphere changes should be highly paid attention to.					; Bo, Su/JFL-0156-2023	Su, Bo/0000-0003-1499-2728; 													0023-074X	2095-9419					2019	64	19					1975	1984		10.1360/N972018-01314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/N972018-01314													WOS:000496456400002
J	COOK, AG				COOK, AG			BIRDS OF THE DESERT REGION OF UINTAH COUNTY, UTAH	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												The common loon, white pelican, double-creasted cormorant, recurvirostrids, and most grebes, waterfowl, gulls, and terns have become more abundant in Uintah County, Utah, since 1937 (Twomey 1942) due to the establishment of Pelican Lake and adjacent water bodies and the ponds and marshes at Ouray National Wildlife Refuge and Pariette Wetlands Wildlife Management Area. The incidence of herons, egrets, thrushes, nuthatches, and icterids has generally remained about the same since 1937. Diurnal raptors have largely declined in abundance in the desert region of Uintah County since Twomey''s (1942) study. Plovers, sandpipers, phalaropes, and the whitefaced ibis were generally less common in 1977-1982 than in 1937, perhaps chiefly due to their displacement from wintering grounds by human population expansion and agricultural and industrial development. The incidence of owl species remains constant. Most flycatchers, swallows, warblers, vireos, orioles, and emberizids have diminished in number since 1937, probably because of the shrinkage of their winter habitats in Latin America and the southwestern USA. The blue grosbeak and black-throated sparrow were not recorded in Uintah County in 1937 but were found there during this study and may represent a range extension northward since 1937. The blue-gray gnatcatcher is more common now than in 1937 due to the northward extension of its range. The starling and rock dove and, more recently, the common grackle, great-tailed grackle, and cattle egret have invaded Uintah County due to the expansion of their ranges. It is not clear why the pine siskin, house finch, and most corvids are presently less common than in 1937.																			0017-3614						1984	44	4					584	620																WOS:A1984TV11900007

However, there is still a gap in whether the succession of different seasonal submerged macrophytes can be achieved by harvesting. The morphological, physiological index, competition intensity of Hydrilla verticillata (H. verticillata) and underwater light under different harvesting intensities of Potamogeton crispus (P. crispus) was studied by a controlled experiment. Under moderate harvesting intensity (harvest 30% and 45% of plant height) of P. crispus, H. verticillata was the least inhibited, resulting in accumulating more Chl a and higher plant height. The underwater light created by moderate-intensity harvesting was favorable for H. verticillata to compete with P. crispus. Thus, moderate-intensity harvesting of P. crispus can promote the growth of H. verticillata. In practice, moderate harvesting intensity of P. crispus can be used to create conditions for the growth of summer species to achieve seasonal succession of submerged macrophytes and maintain the clear-water state of the lake.

The Influence of Hydrologic Residence Time on Lake Carbon Cycling Dynamics Following Extreme Precipitation Events	ECOSYSTEMS												The frequency and magnitude of extreme events are expected to increase in the future, yet little is known about effects of such events on ecosystem structure and function. We examined how extreme precipitation events affect exports of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (t-DOC) from watersheds to lakes as well as in-lake heterotrophy in three north-temperate lakes. Extreme precipitation events induced large influxes of t-DOC to our lakes, accounting for 45-58% of the seasonal t-DOC load. These large influxes of t-DOC influenced lake metabolism, resulting in lake net heterotrophy following 67% of the extreme precipitation events across all lakes. Hydrologic residence time (HRT) was negatively related to t-DOC load and heterotrophy; lakes with short HRT had higher t-DOC loads and greater net heterotrophy. The fraction of t-DOC mineralized within each lake following extreme precipitation events generally exhibited a positive relationship with lake HRT, similar to the previous studies of fractions mineralized at annual and supra-annual time scales. Event-associated turnover rate of t-DOC was higher than what is typically reported from laboratory studies and modeling exercises and was also negatively related to lake HRT. This study demonstrates that extreme precipitation events are 'hot moments' of carbon load, export, and turnover in lakes and that lake-specific characteristics (for example, HRT) interact with climatic patterns to set rates of important lake carbon fluxes.					; Sebestyen, Stephen/D-1238-2013; Solomon, Christopher/E-6284-2014; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021	Zwart, Jacob/0000-0002-3870-405X; Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; Sebestyen, Stephen/0000-0002-6315-0108; Solomon, Christopher/0000-0002-2850-4257; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				AUG	2017	20	5					1000	1014		10.1007/s10021-016-0088-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-016-0088-6													WOS:000407846100011

Irradiance over the growing season at the maximum depth of colonization was about 1800 J/cm2 (1 cal/cm2 = 0.239 J/cm2) for angiosperms and bryophytes and 1200 J/cm2 for charophytes. These values represent, on average, 21 and 11% of the photosynthetically available radiation incident on the water surface. Changes in maximum angiosperm biomass were not correlated with Secchi depth. This suggests that while the depth distribution of aquatica macrophyte communities is primarily controlled by irradiance, environmental parameters other than irradiance and nutrients are also important in determining maximum angiosperm biomass in individual lakes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	4					701	709		10.1139/f85-090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-090													WOS:A1985AHD5400008

Analysis of ice phenology of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau from MODIS data	CRYOSPHERE												The Tibetan Plateau includes a large system of endorheic (closed basin) lakes. Lake ice phenology, i.e. the timing of freeze-up and break-up and the duration of the ice cover may provide valuable information about climate variations in this region. The ice phenology of 59 large lakes on the Tibetan Plateau was derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day composite data for the period from 2001 to 2010. Ice cover duration appears to have a high variability in the studied region due to both climatic and local factors. Mean values for the duration of ice cover were calculated for three groups of lakes defined by clustering, resulting in relatively compact geographic regions. In each group several lakes showed anomalies in ice cover duration in the studied period. Possible reasons for such anomalous behaviour are discussed. Furthermore, many lakes do not freeze up completely during some seasons. This was confirmed by inspection of high resolution optical data. Mild winter seasons, large water volume and/or high salinity are the most likely explanations. Trends in the ice cover duration derived by linear regression for all the studied lakes show a high variation in space. A correlation of ice phenology variables with parameters describing climatic and local conditions showed a high thermal dependency of the ice regime. It appears that the freeze-up tends to be more thermally determined than break-up for the studied lakes.

Mammalian faunas of the type section in the Mud Hills, California, are the basis for defining the Barstovian North American Land Mammal Age. Prior mapping, lithostratigraphy, geochronology, and fossil collecting have established a structural, chronostratigraphic, and biostratigraphic framework for the Barstow Formation. Here, we analyze the sedimentary facies of the lithostratigraphic sequence, infer the major depositional environments, and assess controls on fossil preservation in relation to major facies. We recognize six major facies associations that represent alluvial fans, shallow or seasonal lakes, and channels and floodplains. The transition from older, fan-dominated to younger, floodplain-dominated environments reflects changes in tectonics, accommodation, drainage, and depositional settings during the formation and filling of the basin. Fossil-mammal concentrations are common in four facies associations. Body fossils are abundant in two facies associations that represent well-drained floodplains and spring-fed wetlands. Fossil concentrations are moderately abundant in facies associations that represent floodplains and channel deposits, and fossils are rare in facies associations that represent alluvial fans and lake margins. The highest frequency of fossil localities occurs in the facies associations representing both suitable life habitats and high preservation potential for terrestrial mammals.

Sexual dimorphism in an under-ice spawning fish: the burbot (Lota lota)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Sexual dimorphic characteristics arise in response to differing selective pressures on the sexes and can be used to attract mates or signal reproductive readiness. How sexual dimorphism is expressed where visual cues may be of limited use is an underexplored aspect of reproductive ecology. The burbot (Lota lota (L., 1758)) is a common boreal fish that is not overtly sexually dimorphic. It spawns mid-winter in a light-limited under-ice environment. We examined a variety of morphological and reproductive characteristics in burbot from a northern lake over one full year to assess both seasonal and sex-based variation. Spawning occurred under ice in early February. Seasonal variation was more pronounced in females for many of the traits examined. Growth, fin lengths, swim bladder mass, and liver lipid concentration did not differ between the sexes. Male burbot had significantly higher body condition, larger gas glands, and smaller livers. Males also had significantly larger gonads than females, unusual for boreal fishes. The high gonadal investment of male burbot suggests that sperm competition may be intense in this species. This study demonstrates that sexual dimorphism can be subtle and is present in a seemingly monomorphic species-the burbot.

Scott			Two-step dialogue between the cladoceran Bosmina and invertebrate predators: Induction and natural selection	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Aquatic prey species respond to predators with fast (developmental) and slow (selective) feedbacks. Natural selection is assumed to fashion details of induction and to modify baseline morphology, but only rarely do we catch the slower (multi-generation) process in action. Laboratory experiments with Bosmina detected predatormediated induction and estimated spine heritability (h(2) = 0.2-0.5). Third Sister Lake, Michigan, U. S. A., Bosmina exhibited induction to resident (Mesocyclops) and to two nonresident, neighborhood predators (Epischura and Leptodora). However, the magnitude of induction in Third Sister Lake Bosmina to nonresident predators (Epischura, Leptodora) was muted, when compared with induction and final spine lengths in Epischura-Leptodora lakes. Inadvertent escape of Leptodora into Third Sister Lake in 1987 created a long-term (multiyear), whole-lake experiment, where resident Bosmina populations fell under intense size selection. During the interval, Leptodora suppressed a late-season smaller, short-featured species (B. freyii), favored seasonal expansion of an overwintering long-featured species (B. liederi), and selected for longer features in the latter species. Before local extinction, defensive spines of B. liederi achieved lengths comparable to populations that co-occur with Epischura and Leptodora.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2010	55	1					403	419		10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0403	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0403													WOS:000272759900028

There is also a broad consensus that blooms are increasing with global warming, but the impacts of other concomitant environmental changes, such as an increase in extreme rainfall events, may affect this response. One of the potential effects of high rainfall events on phytoplankton communities is greater loss of biomass through hydraulic flushing. Here we used a shallow lake mesocosm experiment to test the combined effects of: warming (ambient vs. +4 degrees C increase), high rainfall (flushing) events (no events vs. seasonal events) and nutrient loading (eutrophic vs. hypertrophic) on total phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and cyanobacterial abundance and composition. Our hypotheses were that: (a) total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial abundance would be higher in heated mesocosms; (b) the stimulatory effects of warming on cyanobacterial abundance would be enhanced in higher nutrient mesocosms, resulting in a synergistic interaction; (c) the recovery of biomass from flushing induced losses would be quicker in heated and nutrient-enriched treatments, and during the growing season. The results supported the first and, in part, the third hypotheses: total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial abundance increased in heated mesocosms with an increase in common bloom-forming taxa-Microcystis spp. and Dolichospermum spp. Recovery from flushing was slowest in the winter, but unaffected by warming or higher nutrient loading. Contrary to the second hypothesis, an antagonistic interaction between warming and nutrient enrichment was detected for both cyanobacteria and chlorophyll-a demonstrating that ecological surprises can occur, dependent on the environmental context. While this study highlights the clear need to mitigate against global warming, oversimplification of global change effects on cyanobacteria should be avoided; stressor gradients and seasonal effects should be considered as important factors shaping the response.

Its lies in Albania and Montenegro border and has been the object of study for a lot of researchers that imply the different field of study. Eutrophication is becoming main problem of the deterioration of the quality of natural waters. This problem although a natural process that happens over time is often accelerated by human activity in natural waters banks named cultural eutrophication. There are some methods to assess the condition of the trophic status of a lake, one of which is used for the Shkodra lake and is shown in this article. In this study is shown how to use the trophic states index (TSI) (Carlson 1977) to assess the trophic condition for the Shkodra lake. Results of analyses showed that open waters retain their status throughout the year as oligotrophic waters but the coast and especially the south-east coast waters of the lake represent a greater value of TSI which grows during the summer which is thought to be linked to seasonal developments of the lake and the increased human activity near the lake.

The fixation rates in the bay were low but detectable during the summer. The fixation activities were correlated with the presence of N fixing blue-green algae, and the distribution of the algal species in the water was affected by nitrate enrichment. With the addition of nitrate, species not able to fix atmospheric N became predominant. However in the absence of external N (i.e., nitrate), species able to fix N became dominant. P enrichment alone did result in higher N-fixation rates in the water and, without the addition of P, the fixation rates are lower and fluctuate throughout the season, presumably dependent on the availability of P in the water.

The highest surface water temperatures in lakes occurred most often at the turn of the last decade of July and the first decade of August, reaching values above 2 degrees C in most lakes. In the daily cycle, the highest water temperatures in the surface water layer (up to 1.5 m deep) were recorded mostly between 14:00 and 17:00 (13:00-16:00 GMT). The beginning of the bathing season on lakes in Poland usually falls between May 20 and 25, while the end is in the second half of September, reaching an average of about 69 days, characterized by a positive trend in its duration.

It is contained within sediments that were deposited in ponds or lakes in front of the retreating glacier. An herb-dominated tundra existed in the southern Puget Lowland at that time. Lake Tapps tephra is most likely the product of an eruption that in part was phreatomagmatic. It forms an early Pleistocene stratigraphic marker across the southern sector of the Puget Lowland and provides a link between Puget lobe sediments of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet and sediments deposited by Olympic alpine glaciers.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				NOV	1987	28	3					340	355		10.1016/0033-5894(87)90002-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(87)90002-0													WOS:A1987L337900002
J	Zhan, LC; Chen, JS; Li, L; Xin, P				Zhan, Lucheng; Chen, Jiansheng; Li, Ling; Xin, Pei			Plant water use strategies indicated by isotopic signatures of leaf water: Observations in southern and northern China	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Plants act as an important component in the terrestrial hydrosphere. To determine the relationship between vegetation and hydrosphere under different climate conditions of China, large-scale investigations and sampling campaigns were conducted in typical humid lake areas of southern China and in semiarid-arid regions of northern China. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic signatures were used to reveal the water utilization characteristics of plants in these areas. The results suggest that isotopic signatures of plant leaf water can effectively indicate the water source used by plants. Vegetation in humid lake areas relies mainly on water supplement from surface water, whereas groundwater constitutes the primary water source for plant survival in semiarid-arid areas. The differences in the water utilization strategies of plants suggest considerable differences in the local hydrological processes between southern and northern China. Unlike the humid areas of southern China, the dependence of plants on groundwater in semiarid-arid northern China implies the difficulty for the sparse rainfall to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater system. This study demonstrated that the analysis of plant leaf isotopic signatures could constitute a useful method for further study of the controversial groundwater origin in northern China, which is important for maintaining ecological balance and alleviating the effects of serious water shortages.					; Li, Ling/E-5632-2010; Zhan, Lucheng/HZH-3995-2023; Xin, Pei/E-6115-2011	Lucheng, Zhan/0000-0001-7389-6002; Xin, Pei/0000-0002-3090-3409													0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2019	276								107624	10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107624													WOS:000500195900021

Cyanobacterial equilibrium phases in a small tropical impoundment	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The cyanobacterium Limnothrix has been reported especially in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and lowland rivers of temperate regions. However, the first bloom of a member of this genus in Brazil was reported in Manacas Lake. Phytoplankton seasonal succession was studied weekly for 2 years, with the aim of identifying steady-state periods of Limnothrix dominance. During a 2-year period, L. bicudoi comprised 87% of the total phytoplankton biomass. Two (13- and 7-week period) steady-state phases of L. bicudoi dominance were observed during two cold dry seasons, although cyanobacterial blooms are more expected during summer months, even in the tropics. Compared with temperate systems, L. bicudoi may represent an example of steady-state formation at higher temperatures. Low disturbance during cold dry seasons, especially related to temperatures below 20 degrees C, long mixing periods, nutrient availability and high turbidity have favored these long steady-state phases. Although competitive exclusion is the primary mechanism that selects species towards equilibrium, high adaptability to these conditions seems to be the factor related to the occurrence of these steady-state phases, with the unusual dominance of Limnothrix in a tropical impoundment.

Diverse proxy records are essential to forge a robust understanding of the climate system on the TP. Currently, there is a general lack of understanding of the response of inland lakes over the TP to climate change, especially glacier-fed lakes. Paleohydrological reconstructions of such lakes could deepen our understanding of the history of lake systems and their relationship to regional climate variability. Here we use records ofn-alkanes and grain size from the sediments of Bangong Co in the western TP to reconstruct paleohydrological changes over the past 16,000 years. ThePaq record (the ratio of non-emergent aquatic macrophytes versus emergent aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial plants) is generally consistent with the variations in summer temperature and precipitation isotopes. The changes in grain-size distributions show a similar trend toPaq but with less pronounced fluctuations in the early-middle Holocene. The new data combined with previous results from the site demonstrate that: 1) Bangong Co experienced relatively large water-level fluctuations during the last deglaciation, with a steadily high lake-level during the early-middle Holocene and a decreasing lake-level in the late Holocene; 2) The lake level fluctuations were driven by both high summer temperatures via the melting water and monsoon precipitation. However, the dominant factor controlling lake level changed over time. The lake-level history at Bangong Co deduced from then-alkanes and grain-size records reveals the past hydrological changes in the catchment area, and stimulates more discussion about the future of glacier-fed lakes under the conditions of unprecedented warming in the region.

Dynamics of Aphanizomenon and Microcystis (cyanobacteria) during experimental manipulation of an urban impoundment	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Ford Lake in southeastern Michigan has a history of midsummer cyanobacterial blooms marked by a regular succession from heterocystous Aphanizomenon flos-aquae to nonheterocystous Microcystis aeruginosa. Nitrogen (N)-fixing Aphanizomenon has an advantage following seasonal thermal stratification because nitrate is consumed by assimilative uptake in the epilimnion and by anaerobic respiration in the anoxic hypolimnion. If nitrate levels increase, however, Microcystis succeeds Aphanizomenon. Bioassays corroborated the importance of nitrate to Microcystis success in late summer. Experimental releases of hypolimnetic water from the hydroelectric outlet dam before anoxia developed in 2006 destabilized the water column without altering lake volume and promoted a diatom bloom rather than cyanobacteria. To establish that the experimental manipulation was reproducible, we followed 2006 with a control year and then a second experimental year. In 2007, experimental manipulation was not performed, water was withdrawn from the epilimnion alone, and the lake reverted to historical dominance by first Aphanizomenon and then Microcystis. In 2008 we again commenced hypolimnetic discharge at onset of thermal stratification, and a sequence of diatom blooms resulted, demonstrating that community transformation first produced in 2006 was reproducible. The algal community again became transformed from cyanobacteria to diatoms, but overall biomass did not change. Bioassays demonstrated that Aphanizomenon became P limited during diatom dominance. Cyanobacterial blooms were postponed until after termination of the whole lake experiment and subsequent diatom decline.																			1040-2381					JUN 1	2013	29	2					103	115		10.1080/10402381.2013.800172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2013.800172													WOS:000320082900003
J	Thompson, BC; Hughes, MA; Anderson, MC				Thompson, BC; Hughes, MA; Anderson, MC			Effects of including non-breeding bird species on predicted bird distributions for conservation planning in New Mexico	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												There has been uncertainty in the national gap analysis program about including non-breeding birds in distribution models because of concerns that distributions of migrant and winter birds are difficult to predict and are not necessary to assess biodiversity patterns. New Mexico gap analysis included migrant and non-breeding birds assuming that distributions could be predicted using habitat associations, and that excluding non-breeding bird habitat from avian richness projections potentially underestimates community types important to birds. We compared biodiversity estimates including non-breeding birds (inclusive estimate-324 species) to estimates including only breeding birds (breeding bird estimate-257 species) in terms of estimated patterns of species richness. Inclusive and breeding bird richness estimates agreed about general locations of some species-rich areas and the most species-poor areas in the state, but were less comparable for intermediate al:eas of bird occurrence. We found < 50% agreement between the two estimates about areas with highest species richness. When non-breeding birds were included, over 2,000,000 ha of short grass steppe shifted to a higher richness category and another 11,600 ha moved into the highest richness category. Graminoid wetlands, playa lakes, and waters in eastern New Mexico also showed elevated richness levels in the inclusive estimate. Our analyses indicate that only assessing breeding distribution does not reliably predict relative importance of areas used by birds throughout New Mexico and should not be used exclusively to identify potential gaps in conservation for land-use evaluation and planning.

Recent rainfall and runoff variability in central Argentina	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Laguna Mar Chiquita, a closed, shallow, hypersaline lake in central Argentina (similar to 30-31 degrees S, 62-63 degrees W), is a sensitive marker of high- and low-frequency changes in regional hydrology and, therefore, of climatic changes at middle latitudes in southeastern South America. Its drainage basin and neighboring areas, including the Sierras Pampeanas de Cordoba, and Sierra del Aconquija (27-33 degrees S, 62-66 degrees W), are under the influence of diverse climate drivers that determine a complex behavior in rainfall and runoff dynamics. Statistical (Mann-Kendall and seasonal Kendall trend tests) and spectral analyses (Fourier and wavelet transform) of the available data show that: (a) there is significant evidence that rainfall has increased in the region since the 2nd half of the 20th century; (b) concurrently, runoff has also increased, particularly in the northern tributaries (north of 3 I'S) of Mar Chiquita; (c) northern rainfall and discharge records mostly exhibit an apparent near-decadal (also near-bidecadal in runoff) climatic signature; and d) the ENSO influence on rainfall appears faint but discernible in the southern (south of similar to 31 degrees S) portion.

Total and phylogenetic group chl a concentrations (derived using chemical taxonomy matrix factorization of diagnostic carotenoids) corresponded with assemblage and group biovolumes estimated from microscopic enumeration (Pless than or equal to 0.001). Diatoms and cryptophytes dominated assemblages and together typically comprised greater than 85% of relative chl a. Total chl a concentrations and both fucoxanthin.chl a(-1) and alloxanthin.chl a(-1) ratios were similar across depths (P > 0.05), indicating uniform distributions of and photophysiological. states for assemblages and diatoms and cryptophytes, respectively, throughout the mixed water column. Total chl a concentrations were not always spatially uniform from near-shore to offshore waters, with the greatest variability reflecting the influence of tributary inflows upon coastal assemblages. Sediment resuspension strongly influenced water column particle density and light climate; however, total and group chl a concentrations did not correspond with coefficients of K-d and suspended particulate matter concentrations (P > 0.05). The correspondence of both fight attenuation and suspended particulate matter concentration with relative diatom chl a (Pless than or equal to 0.001) indicated an apparent association between sediment resuspension and diatoms. This, and the negative association (Pless than or equal to 0.0001) between relative diatom and cryptophyte chl a, corresponded with the spatial dominance of diatom and cryptophyte chl a in near-shore and offshore waters, respectively. The presence of viable chl a and fucoxanthin within the surficial sediment layer, established this layer as a potential source of meroplanktonic diatoms for nearshore assemblages.

J	Purnomo, BJ; Pichler, T				Purnomo, Budi Joko; Pichler, Thomas			Geothermal systems on the island of Java, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												This paper presents an overview of all known geothermal systems on the island of Java by presenting physicochemical data for associated hot springs, cold springs and acid crater lakes. A total of 69 locations were sampled and classified based on their position in either a volcanic complex (volcano-hosted) or a fault zone (fault-hosted). In particular the potential of a magmatic heat source for fault-hosted geothermal systems was investigated. Volcano-hosted geothermal systems had higher HCO3- concentrations and higher Mg/Na ratios than fault-hosted geothermal systems. This geochemical difference is likely due to degassing and subsequent CO2-water reaction in the volcano-hosted systems, which is absent in the fault-hosted geothermal systems. The HCO3 vs. Cl and Mg/Na vs. SO4/Clsystematics indicated that fault-hosted geothermal systems located in the active Quaternary volcanic belt received shallow magmatic fluids, hence should be classified as volcano-hosted geothermal systems. The heat source of fault-hosted geothermal systems located in the old (Tertiary) volcanic belt was investigated by a combination of Li enrichment and calculated reservoir temperatures. There a shallow magmatic heat source was indicated only for the Cilayu and Cisolok geothermal systems. Thus, a deep seated magma was considered to be the heat source for the fault-hosted geothermal systems of Cikundul, Pakenjeng, Parangtritis and Pacitan. In ten of the volcano-hosted geothermal systems, H-2 and O-18 isotope enrichments were found, but not in any of the fault-hosted geothermal systems. Stable isotope enrichment due to evaporation was recognized in the Kawah Candradimuka and Kawah Sileri, Kawah Hujan and Candi Gedong Songo geothermal systems. A combination of intensive evaporation and magmatic gases input produced very heavy stable isotopes in the hot acid crater lakes of the Kawah Kamojang, Kawah Sikidang and Kawah Putih geothermal systems. The addition of substantial amounts of andesitic water to the geothermal fluid was observed in the Candi Songgoriti, Banyuasin and Pablengan geothermal systems. Contrary to established belief fault-hosted geothermal systems on Java could be considered a potential source for geothermal energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some blue colored lake and pond waters in Japan	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 9	International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology Proceedings				30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	AUG 12-18, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				Natural waters with a blue color are occasionally observed in hot springs, ponds, and lakes. Although water appears clear in shallows, the blue color becomes visible in deeper waters (like deep lakes or the sea), because water absorbs light at the red end of the visible spectrum (BROUN & SMIRNOV 1993). If water contains solute such as Fe2+ or Cu2+, it absorbs light and one sees greenish-blue or blue, the complementary color of red or orange. It is also well known that the particles in water can scatter light. Some glacial lakes containing finely ground rock called rock flour (e.g., Peyto Lake and Lake Louise in Canada, Gjend Lake in Norway, and Lake Pukaki & Lake Tekapo in New Zealand) have a characteristic blue color. We have reported that the blue color of some hydrothermal waters of Beppu (Oita-ken) in Japan are explained by Rayleigh scattering of the short wavelength visible light by the colloidal silica (OHSAWA et al. 2002). We have observed 3 blue natural waters generated by the mixture of sulfuric acid water (containing Al) and Na-Cl type hot spring water (containing Si) in Japan. We attempted to determine the factor responsible for the color of Lake Shima (36 degrees 37'N;138 degrees 47'E) in Gunma-Ken, Pond Aonuma (37 degrees 39'N;140 degrees 4'E) of Goshikinuma in Fukushima-Ken, and Pond Umijigoku (33 degrees 19'N;131 degrees 28'E) in Oita-Ken.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54080-8				2010	30		9				1416	+																WOS:000312418900023

The Late Upper Paleolithic occupation of the northern Tibetan Plateau margin	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The pre-Neolithic history of the Tibetan Plateau is virtually unknown. Test excavations of Late Paleolithic sites, described here, provide preliminary evidence that the initial occupation of the plateau's extreme environments was by small groups of foragers probably traveling from lower elevation plateau margins. These foragers occupied very short-term camps focused on the procurement and extensive processing of small-to-medium mammals. Five separate occupations date to 13-15,000 Cal yr BP, but limited survey data suggest mid-elevation locations may have been temporarily occupied as early as 25,000 years ago. Full-time, year-round occupation of the plateau probably did not take place until the early Neolithic advent of domesticated animals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Through four seasons of phytoplankton sampling surveys from 2019-2020, we analyzed spatial and temporal changes in phytoplankton communities, water quality, and aquatic plant recovery in conjunction with previous research literature to reveal the response mechanisms of phytoplankton community structure to rapidly recovering aquatic vegetation. The results showed that the Secchi depth increased (0.4 m to 0.7 m), the concentration of total phosphorus decreased (0.053 mg/L to 0.41 mg/L), the species of aquatic plants (5 species to 16 species), phytoplankton species (210 species to 254 species) and cell density increased after the removal of the seine. Since the removal of the seine of Shengjin Lake, the aquatic vegetation cover has exceeded 80%, the phytoplankton biodiversity has increased, and the water quality has recovered to II-III water status. Our results show that aquatic plants improve water quality through direct and indirect effects and influence phytoplankton community structure together with the water environment, which can provide guidance for the restoration situation of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River through-river lake ecosystems.

This paper considers the functional approach by Reynolds et al. (2002), a method capturing much of the species ecology and which is successfully used for describing phytoplankton successions. Deep karstic lakes are attributed with the early spring (April) formation of stratification, low phytoplankton biomass, and with maximum biomass accumulating in July. The co-occurrence of functional groups in those lakes is evident but typically distinct according to different biomass proportions. The functional groups A, B, C, D, P, E and L-O, represented by different Cyclotella, Ulnaria/Fragilaria, Dinobryon, Ceratium/Peridinium species, co-occurred in 50 % and up to 90 % of phytoplankton biomass in all investigated lakes. By observing the co-occurrence across the Croatian karstic region we: (i) demonstrate the regional distribution of phytoplankton assemblages in relation to low nutrient environment, and (ii) build a simple uniform pattern which successfully describes a variety of phytoplankton in deep karstic lakes and provides information of reliable indicators for those systems.					; Zutinic, Petar/AGR-1031-2022; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023; Borojević, Koraljka/C-7713-2013	Zutinic, Petar/0000-0002-9836-9636; Gligora Udovic, Marija/0000-0002-1982-2528; 													1863-9135					DEC	2015	187	2					101	111		10.1127/fal/2015/0759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2015/0759													WOS:000367146800002

Nineteen traplines were set in six major vegetation zones; the southern deciduous and coniferous forests, boreal forests, coastline habitats, wetlands, and river lowland. A total of 890 small mammals was trapped. The four most abundant and widely distributed species were Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse), Sorex cinereus (common shrew), Clethrionomys gapperi (Northern red-backed vole), and Sorex fumeus (smoky shrew). The abundance and distribution of omnivores, insectivores and herbivores is different between some plant communities within the park.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	1989	103	1					70	74																WOS:A1989CK61500012

With an apparent catchment of 15.6 km2, it is fed by runoff and karst springs. Its level shows strong annual and interannual variations, depending on weather conditions, particularly rainfall and evapotranspiration. Droughts that have marked the last three decades have resulted in a lowering of about 7 m of the water level. But heavy rainfall that occurred in 2008-09 and 2009-10 caused a marked rise. A multiple regression of sufficient quality (r = 0.87) binds the annual change (from august to august) at differents parameters (weather conditions and initial level of the lake).																			1958-573X						2011	5									10.4000/physio-geo.2145	http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/physio-geo.2145													WOS:000420566000018

Ragweed and sagebrush pollen can distinguish between vegetation types at broad spatial scales	ECOSPHERE												Patterns of vegetation distribution at regional to subcontinental scales can inform understanding of climate. Delineating ecoregion boundaries over geologic time is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between prairie types at broad spatial scales using the pollen record. Pollen ratios are sometimes employed to distinguish between vegetation types, although their applicability is often limited to a geographic range. The Neotoma Paleoecology Database offers an unparalleled opportunity to synthesize a large number of pollen datasets. Ambrosia (ragweed) is a genus of mesic-adapted species sensitive to summer moisture. Artemisia (sagebrush, wormwood, mugwort) is a genus of dry-mesic-adapted species resilient to drought. The log pollen ratio between these two common taxa was calculated across the North American midcontinent from surface pollen samples housed in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. The relative proportion of Ambrosia has roughly doubled since European settlement, likely due to widespread disturbance, while Artemisia proportions are nearly unchanged. Correcting surface samples for the disturbance signal in modern Ambrosia proportions will allow Ambrosia, a strong indicator of summer moisture, to be more accurately represented. In surface samples where both Ambrosia and Artemisia are reported as nonzero proportions of the pollen sum, mean annual precipitation explains approximately 78% of the variation in the log Ambrosia-to-Artemisia ratio. Application of this model to Little Ice Age pollen samples produces precipitation reconstructions which generally agree with reconstructions from independent non-pollen proxies. In addition, we find that modern ecoregions within the North American midcontinent can be successfully distinguished from one another using the log Ambrosia-to-Artemisia ratio. These relationships can improve reconstructions of past climate and improve delineation of past ecoregion boundaries.

Many engineering problems in this region can be attributed to the variations of ground thermal regime. Engineering projects such as construction of gas pipelines must be based on a good understanding of ground thermal regime and its interaction with seasonal climate changes. Numerical modeling is used to simulate a multimedia system with transient heat transfer in this research. The system includes a snow cover on the top, a shallow lake in the middle, and soils beneath the lake. The finite-element method is used for the spatial domain solution, and the finite-difference method is used for the temporal domain solution. The model is applied to three sites in northern Alaska for a nine-month period during the winter of 1995-1996. The result reveals the impacts of thaw lake on the ground thermal regime, the formation of the talik, as well as the formation of ice in the lake. The model is verified against field observations. The difference between the simulated and observed ice thickness is less than 3%.					; Zhou, Wendy/AAM-7032-2020	Zhou, Wendy/0000-0001-8226-375X; 													0887-381X	1943-5495				JUN	2004	18	2					70	87		10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2004)18:2(70)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2004)18:2(70)													WOS:000221654800002

We report genome-wide ancient DNA for 38 skeletons from Roopkund Lake, and find that they cluster into three distinct groups. A group of 23 individuals have ancestry that falls within the range of variation of present-day South Asians. A further 14 have ancestry typical of the eastern Mediterranean. We also identify one individual with Southeast Asian-related ancestry. Radiocarbon dating indicates that these remains were not deposited simultaneously. Instead, all of the individuals with South Asian-related ancestry date to similar to 800 CE (but with evidence of being deposited in more than one event), while all other individuals date to similar to 1800 CE. These differences are also reflected in stable isotope measurements, which reveal a distinct dietary profile for the two main groups.

Picocyanobacterial abundances ranged between 4.5x10(4) and 1.6x10(5)cellsmL(-1) in Lake Annecy vs. 2.2x10(3) and 1.6x10(5)cellsmL(-1) in Lake Bourget. Cyanomyoviruses ranged between 2.8x10(3) and 3.7x10(5)copies of g20mL(-1) in Lake Annecy vs. between 9.4x10(3) and 9.4x10(5)copies of g20mL(-1) in Lake Bourget. The structures of picocyanobacteria and cyanomyoviruses differed in the two lakes, and a more pronounced dynamic pattern with greater seasonality was observed in Lake Bourget. At the annual scale, there was no relationship between cyanomyovirus and picocyanobacterial abundances or structures, but we could observe that abundances of the two communities covaried in spring in Lake Bourget. We showed that (i) the changes of picocyanobacteria and cyanomyoviruses were caused by the combined effect of several environmental and biological factors the importance of which differed over time and between the lakes, and (ii) the viral control of the picocyanobacterial community was probably relatively weak at the scale of the investigation.

J	Rahel, FJ; Olden, JD				Rahel, Frank J.; Olden, Julian D.			Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Different components of global environmental change are typically studied and managed independently, although there is a growing recognition that multiple drivers often interact in complex and nonadditive ways. We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems, Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between climate change and invasive species that will influence how aquatic ecosystems and their biota will respond to novel environmental conditions.					; Olden, Julian/A-8535-2010	Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; 													0888-8892	1523-1739				JUN	2008	22	3					521	533		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x								18577081					WOS:000256612800007

SGSPs play a significant role in lithium extraction, but the CO32- concentration will decease significantly after a cold winter, resulting in low precipitation efficiency of lithium in SGSPs. Analyzing the characteristics of the brine in the lower convective zone shows the key causative factors of this reduced extraction efficiency to be the imbalances in lithium car-bonate concentration and metastability of the water at low temperatures. In this study, this problem was solved by adding sodium carbonate and agitating the LCZ. First, the proportion of sodium carbonate was determined through experiments and the practicality was further verified using SGSPs. Meanwhile, system changes caused by sodium carbonate in the LCZ were investigated and numerical simulation was carried out for thermal efficiency and salt diffusion process. This study found that the addition of sodium carbonate improved the quality of the brine and the seasonally-induced concentration imbalances between the Li+ and CO32-. By agitating the LCZ, the stable low convection state of the brine was broken, the ions were remixed evenly, and the supersaturation of lithium carbonate was increased. By adding 5 % sodium carbonate to the SGSPs and agitating the brine, the ponds' average lithium yield was increased by 48.3 %, and the grade of the lithium carbonate was increased to over 80 %. This study enriches the application of SGSPs as an industrial tool for mineral exploitation.

J	Gounelle, M; Spurny, P; Bland, PA				Gounelle, M; Spurny, P; Bland, PA			The orbit and atmospheric trajectory of the Orgueil meteorite from historical records	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Using visual observations that were reported 140 years ago in the Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences de Paris, we have determined the atmospheric trajectory and the orbit of the Orgueil meteorite, which fell May 14, 1864, near Montauban, France. Despite the intrinsic uncertainty of visual observations, we were able to calculate a reasonably precise atmospheric trajectory and a moderately precise orbit for the Orgueil meteoroid. The atmosphere entry point was similar to 70 km high and the meteoroid terminal point was similar to 20 km high. The calculated luminous path was similar to 150 km with an entry angle of 20 degrees. These characteristics are broadly similar to that of other meteorites for which the trajectory is known. Five out of six orbital parameters for the Orgueil orbit are well constrained. In particular, the perihelion lies inside the Earth's orbit (q similar to 0.87 AU), as is expected for an Earth-crossing meteorite, and the orbital plane is close to the ecliptic (i similar to 0 degrees). The aphelion distance (Q) depends critically on the pre-atmospheric velocity. From the calculated atmospheric path and the fireball duration, which was reported by seven witnesses, we have estimated the pre-atmospheric velocity to be larger than 17.8 km/sec, which corresponds to an aphelion distance Q larger than 5.2 AU, the semi-major axis of Jupiter orbit. These results suggest that Orgueil has an orbit similar to that of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), although an Halley-type comet cannot be excluded. This is at odds with other meteorites that have an asteroidal origin, but it is compatible with 140 years of data-gathering that has established the very special nature of Orgueil compared to other meteorites. A cometary origin of the Orgueil meteorite does not contradict cosmochemistry data on CII chondrites. If CII chondrites originate from comets, it implies that comets are much more processed than previously thought and should contain secondary minerals. The forthcoming return of cometary samples by the Stardust mission will provide a unique opportunity to corroborate (or contradict) our hypothesis.

In this paper, we reviewed satellite-based studies on vegetation cover changes, biomass and productivity variations, phenological dynamics, desertification, and grassland degradation in China that occurred over the past 23 decades. Our review shows that the satellite-derived index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) during growing season and the vegetation net primary productivity in major terrestrial ecosystems (for example forests, grasslands, shrubs, and croplands) have significantly increased, while the number of fresh lakes and vegetation coverage in urban regions have experienced a substantial decline. The start of the growing season continually advanced in China's temperate regions until the 1990s, with a large spatial heterogeneity. We also found that the coverage of sparsely-vegetated areas declined, and the NDVI per unit in vegetated areas increased in arid and semi-arid regions because of increased vegetation activity in grassland and oasis areas. However, these results depend strongly not only on the periods chosen for investigation, but also on factors such as data sources, changes in detection methods, and geospatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we should be cautious when applying remote sensing techniques to monitor vegetation structures, functions, and changes.

Morphological adaptations to reduce the energetic costs associated with migratory transport are commonly documented for migratory species. However, few studies have investigated whether variation in body morphology can be explained by variation in migratory strategy within a species. We address this question in roach Rutilus rutilus, a partially migratory freshwater fish that migrates from lakes into streams during winter. We both compare body shape between populations that differ in migratory opportunity (open vs. closed lakes), and between individuals from a single population that vary in migratory propensity (migrants and residents from a partially migratory population). Following hydrodynamic theory, we posit that migrants should have a more shallow body depth, to reduce the costs associated with migrating into streams with higher flow conditions than the lakes the residents occupy all year round. We find evidence both across and within populations to support our prediction, with individuals from open lakes and migrants from the partially migratory population having a more slender, shallow-bodied morphology than fish from closed lakes and all-year residents. Our data suggest that a shallow body morphology is beneficial to migratory individuals and our study is one of the first to link migratory strategy and intraspecific variation in body shape.

J	Fussmann, G				Fussmann, G			The importance of crustacean zooplankton in structuring rotifer and phytoplankton communities: An enclosure study	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												During the spring clear-water phase of 1993, an enclosure experiment was performed in the mesotrophic Schohsee (Plon, FRG) in order to assess the impact of crustacean zooplankton on the rotifer and phytoplankton community. Among the crustacean plankton, calanoid and cyclopoid cope pods were abundant, but Daphnia 'longispina' reached the highest densities in this experiment. The colonial rotifer Conochilus unicornis was not affected by crustacean plankton. The two most abundant species, Synchaeta pectinata and Keratella cochlearis, increased exponentially when macrozooplankton had been excluded from the enclosures, but did not increase when crustaceans were present. Birth and death rates of K. cochlearis could be reliably determined in this field experiment, suggesting that this rotifer species was mainly controlled by exploitative competition rather than by mechanical interference or predation. Daphnia 'longispina' generally grazed selectively on the smaller ciliates and algae, thus depriving the rotifers of their phytoplankton resources. ?he dominant alga, the chrysophycean Dinobryon, increased, whether crustaceans were present or not, but appeared to be grazed upon to a certain extent despite its considerable cell size and colonial organization.

Growth of Muksun Coregonus muksun in Different Water Conditions in the Ob River (Russia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Water temperature within the optimum range, a decrease in fish concentration, a high development of the food base, and a long period of flooding of the floodplain have a positive effect on the growth of the muksun Coregonus muksun (Pallas). The low water content and strong summer warming of water in the floodplain-salt-lake system are the unfavorable factors. In cold, high-water years, the growth rate of mature muksun decreases. Individuals of generations born in favorable conditions for feeding and reproduction in the first years of life are characterized by a higher growth rate. An increase in the frequency of hot years adversely affects the growth and reproduction of muksun. Years of average water content and warm high-water years are most favorable for muksun growth.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				JUN	2022	15	3					293	304		10.1134/S1995082922030129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082922030129													WOS:000814408600009

The major finding is a shift toward an earlier date of peak snow water equivalent (SWE) by around fifteen days. Less robust findings are reductions in the amounts of peak SWE and I April SWE. This suggests increased chances of late-summer water shortages, especially when combined with rapid recent population growth. Less freshwater is likely to be available to flow into die Great Salt Lake, increasing its salinity and potentially affecting its ecology.

This article provides a critical overview of regional tourism and climate change research published in academic journals following the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). This article highlights the differential climate risks and opportunities by impact type (e.g. temperature, precipitation, extreme weather, sea level rise, ecosystem change) for all available market segments (e.g. winter sports, beach, parks, and fishing). A synthesis of studies that estimate sectoral carbon emissions and the risk of not transitioning to a net-zero future are also explored, including an overview of national climate policies and decarbonization strategies. Key knowledge gaps are underscored, with research priorities offered to help advance climate action within North America's tourism sector.

Verrucomicrobia are prevalent in north-temperate freshwater lakes and display class-level preferences between lake habitats	PLOS ONE												The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4th most abundant phylum (range 1.7-41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and > 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.

ESR analyses for herbivore teeth and molluscs from Kharga, Dakhleh, and Bir Tarfawi Oases: Constraining water availability and hominin paleolithic activity in the Western Desert, Egypt	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Today, Bir Tarfawi, Kharga and Dakhleh Oases all sit in Egypt's hyperarid Western Desert. A dearth of naturally occurring surface water coupled with <= 0.1 mm/y of precipitation, and evaporation rates > 2 m/y make Bir Tarfawi uninhabitable today, while Dakhleh and Kharga depend on borehole water to support human inhabitation. Yet in scattered locations dotting the Quaternary surfaces and deposits near each oasis, Paleolithic artefacts, fossil ungulate teeth, and snails record times when surface water did exist in wetlands, small ponds, and even large lakes. At Bir Tarfawi in Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5, 7, and 13, wetlands or small lakes supported freshwater snails, large herbivores, and hominins. Dakhleh Oasis hosted a large lake in MIS 6 that provided a deep reliable water supply for many millennia subsequently. ESR dates on fossils and tufa dates show thriving lacustrine and terrestrial ecosystems at Dakhleh during MIS 5, 7, 9,11, and 17, and in shorter episodes in MIS 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12. At Kharga Oasis, springs discharged along the Libyan Escarpment edge, but the water was ponded in small basins dammed within tufa deposits. These dated deposits and fossils attest that water existed there in MIS 2-11, and one spot dating to 2.3 Ma. This proxy evidence suggest that, thanks to higher rainfall and/or groundwater tables, sufficient water persisted for much of the Pleistocene, supporting food resources, like large herbivores and molluscs, to thrive and enabling hominin habitation. and activity in the Western Desert.

Paleoenvironmental reconstruction using stable isotopes and trace elements from archaeological freshwater bivalve shell fragments in Northwest Patagonia, Argentina	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Stable oxygen and carbon isotopes (O-18 and C-13) and the trace elements, manganese (Mn) and strontium (Sr) were analyzed in archaeological bivalve (Diplodon chilensis) shell fragments recovered from Parque Diana Cave, Patagonia, Argentina, to analyze the temporal trends of human occupation of the North Patagonia forest with climatic conditions recorded at regional scale but poorly known at local scale for this site. We established a stratigraphic sequence of thirteen 10 cm thick layers spanning the period c. 2370 BP to c. 580 BP and grouped these layers into three cultural components. According to this region's climate, with rain and snow concentrated in winter and dry summers, our data suggest that these components are contemporary with three climatic periods. A dry period indicated by high values of delta O-18(shell), delta C-13(shell) and Sr/Ca ratio (Mn/Ca ratio does not show any significant trend), in the Lower component is associated with brief incursions of hunter-gatherers from the eastern steppe. In the Middle component, low delta O-18(shell), delta C-13(shell) and Sr/Ca ratios, suggest a humid climate with increased supply of meteoric and/or melt-water along with terrestrial plants organic matter and soil carbonates to the river. According to the archaeological evidence, in this period, hunter gatherers from the Pacific coast and forest started to colonize the area across the Andes cordillera. At the beginning of the Upper component, which is mostly contemporary with the expression of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), the proxies are not totally coincident but a tendency to progressively drier conditions could be inferred. Except for layer 4 for delta O-18(shell) and layer 5 for Sr/Ca ratio, delta O-18(shell), delta C-13(shell) and Sr/Ca ratio show consistently high levels in the Upper than in the Middle component. In layer 5, delta O-18(shell) and delta C-13(shell) are elevated with respect to the Middle component while Sr/Ca ratio remains low. In layer 4, delta C-13(shell) and Sr/Ca ratio are high while delta(18)Oshell shows a negative peak. In layers 3 to 1, delta(18)Oshell, delta C-13(shell) and Sr/Ca ratio remain at high levels, indicating an arid-warm climate with high aquatic plant productivity, in coincidence with the expression of the MCA reported for this region in a partially contemporaneous period (1080-1250 AD). At this time, the occupation of the site by groups of the same origin as those present in the Middle component became permanent. Extensive and intensive use of local resources in this period can be inferred from the quality and quantity of artifacts recovered.

The First Record of Northern Sunfish (Lepomis peltastes) in the Lake Champlain Watershed	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In the summer of 2016, a population of Lepomis peltastes (Northern Sunfish), a New York State threatened species, was discovered in an 8-km reach of the Great Chazy River in Clinton County, NY. This population is the first known from the Lake Champlain watershed. Further investigation showed the population extending upstream of the lowest fish barrier for 2.3 km. Northern Sunfish were found in sheltered habitat shared with several other species of Centrarchidae. While a variety of methods were successfully used to catch Northern Sunfish, backpack electroshockers were the most effective. The future of the Northern Sunfish in New York is discussed, as well as the ecological implications for some of the other fish species in the river.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				MAR	2018	25	1					181	187		10.1656/045.025.0113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.025.0113													WOS:000427410200014

The trophic importance of food sources from the riparian zones for invertebrate consumers was analysed using the dual stable isotope technique. We measured stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values for three energy sources and primary consumers in four ponds in NW Spain to determine food sources that support primary consumers. Samples of littoral macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, epiphyton, and riparian vegetation were collected during two periods (summer 2010 and summer 2011) at each site. We used the Mix SIR Bayesian mixing model to model the contribution of potential food sources of organic carbon supporting primary consumers at the study sites. The delta C-13 signatures of food sources varied between -35.5 parts per thousand and -20.76 parts per thousand, whereas the delta N-15 signatures ranged from -6.2 parts per thousand to 11.27 parts per thousand. Primary consumer isotope signatures corrected for the discrimination factor were within the range of the isotope values of the potential food sources in three of the ponds. Significant differences were observed in delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures among sources at each site and overall (p < 0.05). Significant differences were also found among sampling sites for each source separately and for overall food sources (p < 0.05). The MixSIR Bayesian stable isotope mixing model indicated that riparian vegetation and epiphyton were the most important production sources supporting the biomass of invertebrates overall. In addition, riparian vegetation and epiphyton were, most likely, a food source in the three ponds. Macrophytes were an unlikely food source for invertebrates in all ponds, although they could have some importance as a source in the Bodeira pond.					; Benetti, Cesar Joao/C-4404-2013	Garrido, Josefina/0000-0001-6008-8276; Benetti, Cesar Joao/0000-0001-6795-2194													0213-8409	1989-1806				JUN	2014	33	1					89	105																WOS:000338003400008
J	Qiang, XK; Xu, XW; Zhao, H; Fu, CF				Qiang, Xiaoke; Xu, Xinwen; Zhao, Hui; Fu, Chaofeng			Greigite formed in early Pleistocene lacustrine sediments from the Heqing Basin, southwest China, and its paleoenvironmental implications	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												The ferrimagnetic iron sulfide greigite (Fe3S4) occurs widely in sulfidic lacustrine and marine sedimentary environments. Knowledge of its formation and persistence is important for both magnetostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental studies. Although the formation mechanism of greigite has been widely demonstrated, the sedimentary environments associated with greigite formation in lakes, especially on relatively long timescales, are poorly understood. A long and continuous sequence of Pleistocene lacustrine sediments was recovered in the Heqing drill core from southwestern China, which provides an outstanding record of continental climate and environment. Integrated magnetic, geochemical, and paleoclimatic analysis of the lacustrine sequence provides an opportunity to improve our understanding of the environmental controls on greigite formation. Rock magnetic and scanning electron microscope analyses of selected samples from the core reveal that greigite is present in the lower part of the core (part 1, 665.8-372.5 m). Greigite occurs throughout this interval and is the dominant magnetic mineral, irrespective of the climatic state. The magnetic susceptibility (chi) record, which is mainly controlled by the concentration of greigite, matches well with variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) index and total organic carbon (TOC) content, with no significant time lag. This indicates that the greigite formed during early diagenesis. In greigite-bearing intervals, with the chi increase, B-c value increase and tends to be stable at about 50 mT. Therefore, we suggest that chi values could estimate the variation of greigite concentration approximately in the Heqing core. Greigite favored more abundant in terrigenous-rich and organic poor layers associated with weak summer monsoon which are characterized by high chi values, high Fe content, high Rb/Sr ratio and low TOC content. Greigite enhancement can be explained by variations in terrigenous inputs. Our studies demonstrate that, not only the greigite formation, but also its concentration changes could be useful for studying climatic and environmental variability in sulfidic environments.					xu, xinwen/OEN-8727-2025														1367-9120	1878-5786				MAY 1	2018	156						256	264		10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.01.033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.01.033													WOS:000428829700020

The Nhecolandia, a subregion of the Pantanal wetland in Brazil, is characterized by the existence of similar to 500 saline-alkaline lakes, which support an underexplored and rich diversity of microorganisms. In this study, unicellular and homocytous cyanobacteria from five saline-alkaline lakes were accessed by culture-dependent approaches. Morphological evaluation and analyses of near complete sequences (similar to 1400 nt) of the 16S rRNA genes were applied for phylogenetic and taxonomic placement. This polyphasic approach allowed for the determination of the taxonomic position of the isolated strains into the following genera: Cyanobacterium, Geminocystis, Phormidium, Leptolyngbya, Limnothrix, and Nodosilinea. In addition, fourteen Pseudanabaenales and Oscillatoriales representatives of putative novel taxa were found.

Interflow was found to be the dominant river entrance mode, suggesting future susceptibility of the lake thermal structure to the overall effects of climate change expected in the upstream alpine watershed. A lake model employed the results of a long-term hydrologic model to simulate the effects of a climate change scenario on the lake's thermal evolution for the period 2012-2050. The model predicts an overall average increase in the lake water temperature of 0.012 degrees C/year and a reinforced Schmidt thermal stability of the water column in the winter up to 800 J/m(2). Both these effects may further hinder the deep circulation process, which is vital for the oxygenation of deep water. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Entry, JA; Emmingham, WH				Entry, JA; Emmingham, WH			Nutrient content and extractability in riparian soils supporting forests and grasslands	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Current agricultural practices are responsible for the deposition of large quantities of nutrients to lakes and streams. As the quantity of fertilizer applied often exceeds soil storage capacity, excess nutrients may be discharged from the surface and subsurface into lakes and streams. Riparian forests have been shown to filter some nutrients from agricultural runoff and subsurface flow. We measured nutrient stores and extractability in each season on three sites in surface organic litter and the top 10 cm of mineral soil to compare the buffering capacity of riparian soils supporting forest and grassland vegetation. In all seasons, greater total amounts of nutrients were immobilized in forest surface litter than in grassland surface litter, and greater amounts of NH4+ NO3- P, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Fe were extracted. In the forest, more total N, P, K, Mg, and Zn were found in the surface organic litter in autumn than in other seasons; amounts in grassland did not vary with season. On like soils, the forested riparian sites had substantially greater quantities of macronutrients in the surface organic litter than did grassland sites. In the top 10 cm of mineral soil, more P, K, Ca, Mn, and Fe, but less Zn, B, and Cu, were stored in forest than in grassland ecosystems; more P, K, Ca, but less Mg, were extracted. In the top 10 cm of mineral soil, forest sites had substantially greater quantities of macronutrients but smaller quantities of micronutrients than did grassland sites.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				SEP	1996	4	2					119	124		10.1016/0929-1393(96)00111-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0929-1393(96)00111-4													WOS:A1996VU80500003
J	Valero-Garcés, B; Arenas, C; Delgado-Huertas, A				Valero-Garcés, B; Arenas, C; Delgado-Huertas, A			Depositional environments of Quaternary lacustrine travertines and stromatolites from high-altitude Andean lakes, northwestern Argentina	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Four distinctive depositional subenvironments of fossil travertines and stromatolites are identified in three high-altitude (3500-4000 m above sea level) lacustrine basins: El Peinado, San Francisco (Las Coladas Salar subbasin), and Las Peladas (southern Andean Altiplano, northwestern Argentina). These late Quaternary occurrences are characterized using geomorphological, sedimentological, petrographic, and stable isotopic data. Stromatolites of cyanobacterial origin only develop in shallow lacustrine margins of El Peinado basin. In the same basin, macrophytic travertines occur both near thermal spring seepage areas along the lake margin as in situ facies and in littoral lacustrine environments up to water depths of several metres as phytoclastic travertine facies. The stromatolites and macrophytic travertines have relatively heavy delta O-18 compositions, suggesting initial O-16-depleted waters and (or) evaporation effects through time. Their high delta C-13 compositions are interpreted as a reflection of intense CO2 evasion from the thermal groundwaters feeding the lakes. Similar laminated travertine facies, with no petrographic evidence for biotic origin, occur in both Las Coladas and Las Peladas basins. Neither petrographic nor isotopic data alone can differentiate between these two cases. Besides, diagenetic overprint in Las Peladas facies precludes the use of isotopic values as original isotopic signatures. However, the depositional environmental conditions defined by the geomorphological and sedimentological features are different. Laminated aragonitic crusts in Las Coladas basin formed in a shallow, saline lake and are associated with shoreline and terrace deposits cemented by aragonite. These travertine crusts represent periods of spring, O-16-rich discharge to the lake, as suggested by the lighter oxygen isotopic compositions. In contrast, travertines from Las Peladas occur as laminated calcitic and aragonitic units intercalated at the top of fining-upward sequences composed of conglomerates, sandstones, and intraclastic limestones. Sedimentological data suggest that these travertines originated in fluvial-influenced lake margins during low lake-level episodes.

J	FEDYNICH, AM; GODFREY, RD				FEDYNICH, AM; GODFREY, RD			WATERFOWL MORTALITY SURVEYS ON THE SOUTHERN HIGH-PLAINS OF TEXAS	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Waterfowl carcass surveys were conducted at 15 lakes on the Southern High Plains of Texas during the winter of 1985-1986 to obtain information on the extent and causes of waterfowl mortality. Carcasses and moribund waterfowl were collected during shoreline censuses and necropsied. One hundred forty-four waterfowl, representing eight species, were collected. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) accounted for 45% of the total, followed by American wigeons (Anas americana; 22%), green-winged teals (Anas crecca; 20%), and northern pintails (Anas acuta; 7%). Sex class comparisons were made for the four species most-collected. Significantly more males were collected than would be expected with a 50:50 ratio. Within species, sex class was significant in two of four comparisons (mallards and wigeons). Age class comparisons were performed on three species. Significantly more adults were collected than would be expected with a 50:50 ratio. Within species, age was significant in one of three comparisons (mallards). However, similar sex and age ratios were obtained from ducks live-trapped, suggesting that mortality in our sample was not age or sex specific. Results from 21 necropsied birds indicated that most of the non-hunting mortality was attributable to avian cholera (10 of 12 cases), low-level mortalities from avian cholera can occur without causing a major epizootic, and mild weather does not necessarily preclude the possibility of an avian cholera epizootic. Overall, non-hunting mortality due to disease appears to be highly variable and during the winter of 1985-1986, on at least 15 playas on the Southern High Plains, disease was not an important mortality factor in waterfowl.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				JUN 15	1988	33	2					185	191		10.2307/3671893	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3671893													WOS:A1988P056100007

Supraglacial ponds can also coalesce, forming moraine-dammed lakes at risk of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Given Bhutanese glaciers have some of the highest ice loss rates in the Himalaya and GLOF vulnerability is high, we seek to advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and evolution of supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs. Here, we use high-resolution (3 m) Planet Labs satellite imagery to provide the first short-term, high-resolution dataset of supraglacial pond and ice cliff evolution for three glaciers along the Bhutan-Tibet border from 2016 to 2018. A total of 5754 ponds and 2088 ice cliffs were identified. Large intra-annual changes were observed, with ponded area changes and drainage events coinciding with the seasonality of the Indian Summer Monsoon. On average, similar to 19% of the total number of ponds had a coincident ice cliff. Pond spatial distribution was driven by ice-surface velocities, with higher numbers of ponds found in areas of low velocity (<8 m a(-1)) Our study provides the first detailed, quantitative investigation of supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs in Bhutan, providing a framework for further monitoring in this understudied, yet important, region of the Himalaya.

However, the transition from icehouse to greenhouse conditions was asynchronous across Gondwana suggesting that, in some cases, regional controls played a significant role in deglaciation. Of particular interest to understanding changing LPIA climatic conditions, is the eastern Paganzo Basin. This region was flanked by ice centers in the Precordilleran and Sierras Pampeanas regions of Argentina on the west, and major ice sheets in the Parana, Chaco-Parana, and Sauce Grande basins to the east, all of which resided between similar to 40 and 65 degrees S latitude. Hypotheses on the occurrence of ice in the eastern Paganzo Basin are based on interpretations of the narrow, steep-walled, Olta-Malanzan paleovalley as carved by an alpine glacier or by an outlet glacier draining an eastern ice sheet, and that glaciers deposited coarse clastics within the paleovalley. However, we found no evidence for glaciation. Rather, gravel from prograding alluvial fans/fan deltas and rock falls ponded drainage resulting in lacustrine activity in the eastern end of the valley. A transition from either subaerially or shallow subaqueously deposited sandstones to marine mudstones in the western end of the Olta paleovalley suggest a marine transgression, which, in turn, was overlain by deposits of prograding Gilbert-type deltas. Dropstones were from rock falls off valley walls and rafting by lake ice rather than from icebergs. Therefore, we conclude that the climate in western Argentina resulted from uplift induced glaciation in the Precordilleran region and along the western margin of the Paganzo Basin, and the occurrence of a precipitation shadow to the east. The disappearance of the western glaciers during the mid-Carboniferous, prior to deglaciation elsewhere at the same paleolatitude, resulted from a westward shift in the position of the active margin, collapse of the glaciated upland(s), and an expansion of the precipitation shadow across the whole of western Argentina.

Effects of Early Dry Season on Habitat Suitability for Migratory Birds in China's Two Largest Freshwater Lake Wetlands after the Impoundment of Three Gorges Dam	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, the China's two largest freshwater lakes, are the most important wintering area and pathways for migratory birds in East Asia. As a result of human activities (impounding of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), and sand mining) and climate change, the dry season of Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake came early after the impoundment of TGD. And the early dry season (EDS) would change wildlife habitat and would have a negative effect on biology and biodiversity. In this paper, we compared the habitat suitability for Anatidae, Charadriidae, Ardeidae and Laridae (the four main types of migratory birds) of the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake between three normal hydrologic years (NY) and three hydrologic years which had EDS (EY) of each lake by geo-spatial overlay calculation, to reveal the effect of EDS on the habitat suitability for the main types of migratory birds. The grading systems of suitability included four grades: poor (0-25), fair (25-50), good (50-75), and very good (75-100). The results showed that the EDS 1) improved the habitat suitability for Anatidae; 2) had no significant influence on the habitat suitability for Charadriidae and Ardeidae; and 3) had an almost significant adverse effect (would be significant in fact and in the future) on the habitat suitability for Laridae at the two wetlands.					guangming, zeng/AHD-0360-2022; Wu, Haipeng/O-2852-2015; Xiong, Weiping/JXY-1775-2024	Wu, Haipeng/0000-0002-9888-6959; 													1726-2135	1684-8799				DEC	2020	36	2					82	92		10.3808/jei.201900411	http://dx.doi.org/10.3808/jei.201900411													WOS:000604972000002

The main focus of this study was to investigate the effects of single and multiple moderate doses of lime (slaked lime, Ca(OH)(2), and/or calcite, CaCO3) on eutrophic hardwater lakes. This information would contribute to strategies to manage phytoplankton and macrophyte biomass in eutrophic lakes. 2. Water chemistry and biota were monitored for up to 7 years after initial lime treatment and results were compared with reference systems. 3. Complementary studies investigated the effect of lime on macrophytes in ponds, irrigation canals and microcosm experiments. 4. When water pH was kept within its natural range (less than or equal to 10), single and multiple lime applications to lakes and ponds controlled macrophyte biomass, without negatively affecting invertebrate communities. 5. Single lime treatments at moderate dosages of lakes and ponds resulted in variable and mostly temporary changes in chlorophyll a (chl a) and phosphorus (P) concentration. Although sediment P release was reduced in single-dose lakes during the first winter following treatment, reductions appeared temporary. 6. Multiple treatments of lakes and ponds were effective at reducing both chl a and P concentrations over longer periods. Mean winter P release rate was also reduced after initial treatment. 7. In laboratory studies, sediment cores were incubated with eight different treatments to assess P release. Redox-sensitive treatments were no more effective at lowering total P concentration in overlying water than some redox-insensitive treatments. Lime reduced total P concentrations, but was not as effective as treatments with alum. 8. The use of lime in managing macrophyte and phytoplankton biomass in shallow, hardwater lakes and ponds may be preferable over other treatments, because lime is economical and non-toxic as long as pH is kept within a natural range.					; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/U-9107-2019	Murphy, Thomas/0000-0002-5427-1290; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/0000-0002-1070-2968													0046-5070					AUG	2001	46	8					1049	1060		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00788.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00788.x													WOS:000170565800004

Chemical and Ecological Characteristics of Lakes Located in the Muraviovka Park	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												The purpose of this research is to provide ecological and chemical characterization of lakes located in the Muraviovka Park, where more than 300 species of birds nest, rest and winter. High concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water of lakes that comes with as high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) indicates that reservoirs experience eutrophication. Concentration of biogenic organic substances is caused to fluctuate by seasonal changes in water temperature. The fires make the hydro-chemical indicators of wetlands change. Lead concentration in the water is high because it enters the water, moving from the surface layers of soil when natural areas transform into cultivated lands. Macrophytes contain an excess concentration of lead and manganese. Heavy metal concentration in fish is below permissible limits. Despite significant differences in the biology of bird species, birds living in the Muraviovka Park have great amounts of iron, copper and zinc in their feathers. Feather lead concentration was also high. The ecological state of lakes located in the Muraviovka Park is necessary to investigate in order to undertake actions to regulate economic activities.

Climate change (global warming) is predicted to increase these fluctuations, potentially leading to more frequent summer lake drying of shallow, fishless ponds where most R. sierrae breeding and larval development (requiring >= 3 years) occurs today. This study explored the interaction between water availability and the abundance and recruitment of R. sierrae in Dusy Basin, Kings Canyon National Park, California, USA. We mapped the Dusy Basin lakes with GPS, calculated water volumes in a low-snowpack and a high-snowpack year (2002, 2003), and counted R. sierrae. The lakes that dried up in 2002 were repopulated by adults in 2003, without any recruitment of metamorphosed frogs from previous year's tadpoles. The lakes that retained water, even with notable volume decreases (-60%), showed tadpole-to-subadult recruitment in the following year (2003). Similar results are obtained using data for years 1997-2006: significantly greater abundance of metamorphs in permanently wet lakes than in lakes that had dried even once during the 10 years. Similarly, those lakes that had retained water during any two preceding years had significantly more metamorphs than lakes that had dried up during that period. Our results suggest that any increase in drying of small ponds will severely reduce frog recruitment. Combined with the invasive fish that prevent frog breeding in larger lakes, lake drying may cause extinction of local frog populations.

J	Zhang, SR; Xiao, JL; Xu, QH				Zhang, Shengrui; Xiao, Jule; Xu, Qinghai			Regional precipitation variations during Heinrich events and Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles in the northern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon region	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Due to the scarcity of long, high-resolution paleoclimate records, the effects of abrupt climatic events on regional climate variations in middle to high latitudes of East Asia are unclear. We present a detailed pollen record for the past 35,000 years, with an AMS C-14 chronology, from Hulun Lake in northern China. The results reveal four episodes of regional vegetation change during the Last Glaciation, characterized by increases in cold-resistant and drought-tolerant plants and decreased regional vegetation cover. These episodes coincided with Heinrich events (H3, H2 and H1) and the Younger Dryas event (YD) that originated in the North Atlantic region. Additionally, during the warm intervals of the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles and the Bolling-Allerod (B/A) interstadial recorded in Greenland ice cores, patches of broadleaved deciduous forest expanded in the surrounding mountains while typical steppe vegetation expanded in the vicinity of Hulun Lake. Overall, the structure and amplitude of regional vegetation change in the Hulun Lake region during abrupt climatic events differ from the registration of these events in the oxygen isotope records from Greenland ice cores; however, they are similar to coeval stalagmite oxygen isotope records from East Asia. Thus, we suggest that the regional climate variations were characterized by increased or decreased precipitation during H events and D-O cycles in the Hulun Lake region, which was mainly controlled by changes in the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Our results suggest that the variability of the EASM was physically linked to the North Atlantic climate system on centennial- to millennial-scale. In addition, the amplitude of regional precipitation variations during H events and D-O cycles was low during the interstadial of the Last Glaciation and the Last Glacial Maximum; however, the amplitude of regional precipitation variations during H1 event and B/A warming event was substantially greater during the Last Deglaciation. We suggest that differences in NHSI and land surface conditions (ice sheets and sea level) were responsible for the contrasting responses of EASM precipitation to these abrupt climatic events during different intervals.

J	Wisniewska, M; Paczuska, B				Wisniewska, Marzenna; Paczuska, Bogna			Dynamics of the phytoplankton community in mesotrophic Lake Borwno	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The phytoplankton in Lake Borwno has never been included in phycological studies. The objective of our research was qualitative and quantitative analysis with reference to physicochemical parameters. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytoplankton assemblages were performed in 2004 and 2009. A total of 117 taxa were identified in Lake Borwno: Cyanoprocaryota - 35, Cryptophyta - 2, Euglenophyta - 1, Pyrophyta - 3, Chrysophyceae - 4, Bacillariophyceae - 25, Chlorophyta - 47. The bottom of the shallow water was covered with meadows of Charophyceae, with the dominant species Chara vulgaris L. Biomass of the phytoplankton varied from 1.23 mg dm(-3) in April to 5.74 mg dm(-3) in August 2009. Ceratium hirundinella (O.F.Muller) Bergh was the dominant taxon during the whole season, but during summer another co-dominant taxon, Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutz.)Kutz., occurred. The quality parameters, phytoplankton biomass, chlorophyll-a concentration and TSI indicate the mesotrophic character of the lake. The blue-green algae blooms, which are the major problem for preserving the good conditions of water in lakes, were not observed either in 2004 or 2009.

Structure of freshwater zooplankton communities from tundra waterbodies in the Lena River Delta, Russian Arctic, with a discussion on new records of glacial relict copepods	POLAR BIOLOGY												We present new and more complete information than previously available on the pelagic fauna of the Lena River Delta, eastern Siberia. Zooplankton samples collected between 2000 and 2011 from 11 varied aquatic habitats on Samoylov Island have been examined and clear differences noted between the zooplankton communities in different types of tundra waterbody. Well-marked synchronism in the development of common species populations was, however, revealed by analysis of their life cycles. The pelagic fauna of the investigated aquatic ecosystems is heterogeneous in origin, consisting mainly of aboriginal Arctic species but also including invasive species from more temperate latitudes and relicts of ice-age fauna. One hundred and twenty-five zooplankton taxa belonging to Rotifera (67) and Arthropoda (58) phyla were identified. Five Copepoda species and seven Cladocera species were recorded for the first time in the Lena River Delta; the presence of most of these species in the delta's aquatic ecosystems is associated with Lena River water influx during spring flood. Two calanoid copepods, Eurytemora arctica Wilson and Tash and Eurytemora foveola Johnson, are new species to Palearctic pelagic fauna, previously known only from the Nearctic. The data obtained provide new confirmation that the last glaciation had a marked influence on microcrustacean distributions within the Arctic.

We examined both the macrophytic vegetation of the dominant species of the lake in relation to some physical and chemical factors (transparency, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, nutrients of phosphorus and nitrogen and metals) and the effects of dessication and irregular inundation on these species. Apart from macronutrients, high concentrations of nitrate nitrogen were recorded in spring which are attributed to the inundation of the cultivated stretches, but phosphorus was still high throughout the year. The aquatic vegetation of the Kerkini lake is dominated by the species Nymphaea alba L. in deeper and by Salvinia natans in shallow sites. These species appear to better withstand the stress of the fluctuations of the water level. The increase of water depth however led to disappearance of stands of a number of helophytes (e. g. Phragmites, Typha, Scirpus etc.) and to a significant decrease in the species Trapa natans which was dominant in the area.

(2) Both lakes were highly nutrient-rich but, probably because of differences in flushing rate, Hoveton Great Broad had a phytoplankton dominated in summer by diatoms whilst Ranworth Broad had prolific populations of the cyanophyte Oscillatoria. (3) Daphnia hyalina was present in both lakes in early summer but declined in July in Hoveton Great Broad and in June in Ranworth Broad. These declines occurred in both fish-free enclosures and in the open lakes which were not fish-free. The earlier decline in Ranworth Broad is attributed to decline in food quality. (4) For a given body length, smaller eggs were produced by Daphnia hyalina in Ranworth Broad. Such eggs are likely to give smaller neonates, perhaps better able to survive in water dominated by filamentous cyanophytes likely to occlude the feeding apparatus of larger animals. (5) Very large populations of the large-bodied Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna developed in July and August in the enclosures in Hoveton Great Broad but not in the open lake nor at all in Ranworth Broad or its enclosures. This suggests that food quality was suitable in Hoveton Great Broad but not in Ranworth Broad, and that in the presence of adequate food and the absence of fish predation, large grazer communities of Daphnia can be maintained from May to September in shallow eutrophic lakes.

We found that (i) A. ligamentina and A. plicata displayed different seasonal changes in physiology and biochemical composition, (ii) larval brooding affected the physiology but not the biochemical composition of A. ligamentina, and (iii) A. plicata had a greater carbohydrate content and condition index than A. ligamentina. A. ligamentina and A. plicate had different patterns of ammonia excretion rate, O:N ratio. and clearance rate, while patterns of oxygen uptake rate were similar between the two species. Overall, weight specific metabolic rates were higher in A. ligamentina than in A. plicata. Both species had low protein and high carbohydrate content in early summer. Brooding specimens of A. ligamentina had lower oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion rates and higher O:N ratios than non-brooding specimens. Differences in condition and carbohydrate content between the two species could explain some of the species-specific mortalities observed since the introduction of zebra mussels.

J	HENNES, KP; SIMON, M				HENNES, KP; SIMON, M			SIGNIFICANCE OF BACTERIOPHAGES FOR CONTROLLING BACTERIOPLANKTON GROWTH IN A MESOTROPHIC LAKE	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Bacterium-specific viruses have attracted much interest in aquatic microbial ecology because they have been shown to be about 10 times more abundant than planktonic bacteria. So far most of the studies of interactions of planktonic bacteria and viruses have been done in marine environments, and very little is known about these interactions in lakes. Therefore, we studied phage proliferation in Lake Constance, a large mesotrophic lake in Germany. We enumerated bacteria and quantified the fraction of bacteria with mature intracellular phage particles and the number of free viruses by transmission electron microscopy. Between the end of March and early August 1992, peaks of bacterial abundance were followed in 1 to 2 weeks by peaks in the fraction of bacteria containing visible phage particles (0 to 1.7%) and in the number of free viruses (1 x 10(7) to 4 x 10(7) ml(-1)). We estimated that 1 to 17% +/- 12% of all bacteria were phage infected, implying that phage-induced mortality was <34% +/- 24% of total mortality. A direct comparison between phage-induced mortality, the net decrease of bacterial numbers, and bacterial growth rates indicated that phage-induced mortality accounted for <11% of total bacterial mortality during the phytoplankton spring bloom and 18 to 21% following the bloom. Estimated burst sizes ranged from 21 to 121 phages. Phage production rates of 0.5 x 10(6) to 2.5 x 10(6) ml(-1) day(-1) accounted for 70 to 380% of the observed net increase rates of free phages, implying high rates of simultaneous phage decay. The cyclic dynamics between bacteria and phages and the varying size structure of the intracellular mature phage particles suggested that phage infection was important in structuring the bacterial host assemblage during the study period.																			0099-2240					JAN	1995	61	1					333	340		10.1128/AEM.61.1.333-340.1995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.61.1.333-340.1995								16534914					WOS:A1995PY86700054

The aim of the investigations was to monitor changes in heavy metal (HM) concentrations in different media over the periods, as well as to evaluate potential of two littoral plants, Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia, for phytoremediation under natural conditions. Investigations revealed differences in HM concentrations in water and sediments. Higher values were observed in sediments than in water. The decrease in concentrations of both HMs in sediments was noted in two of the three selected water reservoirs during growing seasons, which suggests the possibility of their adsorption and accumulation by aquatic plants. Both investigated plant species accumulated ample amount of Cd and Pb in underground and aboveground plant tissues, however T. angustifolia revealed higher Cd translocation potential than P. australis. The latter revealed higher Pb accumulation in two lakes. Moreover, the translocation ratio was usually higher in spring, especially for Pb, in both plant species. Increasing level of pollution load index in sediment along the Bogdanka watercourse indicates accumulation of measured HMs.					; Borowiak, Klaudia/O-1333-2015; Mleczek, Mirosław/MCI-7217-2025; Lisiak-Zielinska, Marta/LSL-6256-2024	Borowiak, Klaudia/0000-0001-9879-3683; Kanclerz, Jolanta/0000-0001-5871-0097; Lisiak-Zielinska, Marta/0000-0002-0655-9820; Mleczek, Miroslaw/0000-0002-0064-6472; Drzewiecka, Kinga/0000-0002-8658-2691													2083-4772	2083-4810				SEP	2016	42	3					47	57		10.1515/aep-2016-0032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aep-2016-0032													WOS:000383829700008
J	KLEIN, TM; ALEXANDER, M				KLEIN, TM; ALEXANDER, M			BACTERIAL INHIBITORS IN LAKE WATER	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The populations of six bacterial genera fell rapidly after their addition to sterile lake water but not after their addition to buffer. The decline in numbers of two species that were studied further, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Micrococcus flavus, occurred even when the buffer was added to sterile lake water. The inhibition of K. pneumoniae by substances in lake water varied with the season of the year, and the rate and extent of decline of both species were different in sterile samples of different lakes. The extent of reduction in the density of K. pneumoniae was independent of initial population size and was diminished by the addition of 10 .mu.g of glucose per ml of lake water. The toxin was removed from lake water by dialysis and by a cation-exchange resin but not by an anion-exchange resin, and it was destroyed by heating. The inhibition of K. pneumoniae was not evident in lake water buffered at a pH value above 8.0. We suggest that toxins may be important in determining the composition of the bacterial community of lakes.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				JUL	1986	52	1					114	118		10.1128/AEM.52.1.114-118.1986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.52.1.114-118.1986								16347097					WOS:A1986D078300021

Between 1976 and 1994, 186 Trumpeter Swans were found either dead or sick in British Columbia; 87 (47%) were diagnosed with acute lead toxicosis. The largest die-off of 32 Trumpeter Swans occurred at Judson Lake in 1992. Tissues from 102 swans were analyzed for lead; 65 (64%) were classified as lead-poisoned. Lead residues detected in kidney, liver, bone, and blood samples of lead-poisoned swans averaged 30.6 mg/g, 23.7 mg/g, 18.3 mg/g and 4.4 mg/g wet weight, respectively. Ingested lead shot were detected in gizzards of 46 of the 62 lead-poisoned swans examined; number of pellets per gizzard were counted in 34 swans with an average of 16.8 pellets per bird (range:1-80, SD 17.3). Steel shot were detected in the gizzards of 18 of the 62 lead-poisoned swans examined; number of pellets per gizzard were counted in nine swans with an average of 3.3 pellets per bird (range:l-ll, SD 3.2). Although the use of lead shot for waterfowl hunting has been banned in the main wintering areas of Trumpeter Swans since 1990, these birds continue to die from lead poisoning. Despite the high rate of unnatural mortality among Trumpeter Swans reported to our agency, their populations in the region currently are increasing. Lead poisoning as a threat to Trumpeter Swan populations in British Columbia is assessed.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1998	112	2					204	211																WOS:000075085600003

However, some recent researches have proposed a mid-Holocene drought interval of millennial-scale in East Asian monsoon margin areas. Thus whether mid-Holocene was dry or humid remains an open issue. Here, Zhuyeze palaeolake, the terminal lake of the Shiyang River Drainage lying in Asian monsoon marginal areas, was selected for reconstructing the details of climate variations during the Holocene, especially mid-Holocene, on the basis of a sedimentological analysis. Qingtu Lake (QTL) section of 6.92m depth was taken from Zhuyeze palacolake. Multi-proxy analysis of QTL section, including grain size, carbonate, TOC, C/N and delta C-13 of organic matter, was used to document regional climatic changes during 9-3 cal ka B.P. The record shows a major environmental change at 9.0-7.8 cal ka B.P., attributed to a climate trend towards warmth and humidity. This event was followed by a typical regional drought event which occurred during 7.8-7.5 cal ka B.P. And a warm and humid climate prevailed from 7.5 to 5.0 cal ka B.P., attributed to the warm/humid Holocene Optimum in this region. After that, the climate gradually became drier. Moreover, comparison of the climate record from this paper with the summer insolation at 30 degrees N indicates that the climate pattern reflecting the Asian monsoon changes was caused by insolation change.

Climate and species affect fine root production with long-term fertilization in acidic tussock tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska	OECOLOGIA												Long-term fertilization of acidic tussock tundra has led to changes in plant species composition, increases in aboveground production and biomass and substantial losses of soil organic carbon (SOC). Root litter is an important input to SOC pools, although little is known about fine root demography in tussock tundra. In this study, we examined the response of fine root production and live standing fine root biomass to short- and long-term fertilization, as changes in fine root demography may contribute to observed declines in SOC. Live standing fine root biomass increased with long-term fertilization, while fine root production declined, reflecting replacement of the annual fine root system of Eriophorum vaginatum, with the long-lived fine roots of Betula nana. Fine root production increased in fertilized plots during an unusually warm growing season, but remained unchanged in control plots, consistent with observations that B. nana shows a positive response to climate warming. Calculations based on a few simple assumptions suggest changes in fine root demography with long-term fertilization and species replacement could account for between 20 and 39% of the observed declines in SOC stocks.					; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013; Nadelhoffer, Knute/AAE-7744-2020	Sullivan, Patrick/0000-0002-8015-3036; Nadelhoffer, Knute/0000-0001-9775-894X													0029-8549	1432-1939				SEP	2007	153	3					643	652		10.1007/s00442-007-0753-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-007-0753-8								17497180					WOS:000248812000016

Through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, twenty-nine elements were analyzed and their sources and fluxes were investigated. Mean elemental concentrations were lower than those at the edge of the TP. Some elements, such as Cr, Ni, Cd, and Pb, exhibited high enrichment factors (Cr: 22; Ni: 17; Cd: 23; and Pb: 9), indicating possible anthropogenic influence in this remote region, particularly during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. In addition, an empirical orthogonal function analysis revealed the dominance of crustal-origin elements, rather than anthropogenic elements, in the aerosol. Furthermore, backward air mass trajectories demonstrated that the Nam Co region was mainly influenced by air masses from Central and South Asia. Accordingly, because of dust storms from Central Asia and within the TP, crustal element concentrations, such as of Al, were higher during winter and pre-monsoon seasons than during the monsoon season. By contrast, anthropogenic elements, such as Cr and Cd, were relatively higher during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons because of pollutants transported from South Asia, where atmospheric brown clouds are concentrated and biomass combustion is prevalent. Dry deposition of aerosols dominated in the Nam Co region, particularly during the non-monsoon period, which is useful to interpret the elemental records in the TP ice cores and lake sediments.

In this paper, the principal anthropogenic influences on the ecosystem of the Armenian highland lake Sevan during the past century are identified. The diversity and severity of the pressures were influenced by national priorities and the catchment's growth. Changes in the lake's morphometry and the littoral's morphology, as well as unsustainable usage of the lake's fish resources, were among the repercussions. They are discussed depending on how each sort of disturbance affects the ecosystem. Although the timing and degree of each stressor were specified, identifying the direct effects of each stressor was often challenging. The current management decisions and future threats to the lake's ecosystem are discussed. This article describes the history of the anthropogenic change of Lake Sevan and, using it as an example, assesses the ecological footprint of people on natural resources and their repercussions.

J	Gyllström, M				Gyllström, M			Induction and termination of diapause in a freshwater zooplankton community	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												I examined production of, and emergence from, diapausing eggs, together with planktonic dynamics of three cladoceran genera (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, and Daphnia) for 16 months in a shallow lake. In a complementary field experiment I manipulated environmental variables potentially important as cues for induction and termination of diapause. Ceriodaphnia and Daphnia, but not Bosmina, were dependent on emergence to initiate planktonic populations in spring. During the rest of the season, emergence was unimportant for population and community dynamics. The timing of diapausing-egg production differed between genera, but tended to coincide with peaks in abundance. No hatching was found in any of the experimental treatments, but diapausing-egg production was found in high nutrient treatments with no fish. Field study and experiment together imply that the types of environmental cues involved in diapause induction are different from the ones stimulating its termination. Seasonal cues such as photoperiod appear to govern the hatching of diapausing eggs. In comparison, the induction of diapausing-egg production seems less dependent on season and more on biotic factors.																			0003-9136					SEP	2004	161	1					81	97		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0161-0081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0161-0081													WOS:000224201400005

In the present study, we demonstrate that its applicability to upland lakes is limited due to the modification of water chemistry by catchment processes, in particular, the contribution of rock weathering to sodium ion concentration. In Northern Ireland, 615 lakes between 1 and 100 hectares surface area were sampled and analysed in the summers of 1988-1990. Data from these lakes are used to derive a modified version of Gibbs' model, which accounts for local rainfall chemistry and the contribution of rock weathering or other sources to sodium ion concentration.																			0043-1354					JAN	1996	30	1					178	182		10.1016/0043-1354(95)00140-G	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(95)00140-G													WOS:A1996TG77200022
J	Chapin, DM; Paige, DK				Chapin, David M.; Paige, Dwayne K.			Response of Delta Vegetation to Water Level Changes in a Regulated Mountain Lake, Washington State, USA	WETLANDS												Water level fluctuations are well known to structure wetland vegetation along lakeshores, but the hydroperiod components that drive plant community change are often not differentiated. This study characterized river delta plant communities and examined the distribution and hydroperiods of dominant species in response to a changing, hypervariable lake water regime. At three intervals over an 18 year period we mapped plant communties and developed hydroperiod graphs of dominant plant species at comparable points along their elevation distribution. These low diversity community types (sedge, willow, and cottonwood/alder dominated) generally shifted upslope as lake water levels increased. Hydroperiod graphs showed that the dominant sedge species (Carex vesicaria) moved upslope enough to maintain a similar hydroperiod as lake water levels increased, but the dominant shrub species (Salix spp.) did not. The lower sedge boundary was best correlated to late summer water levels, indicating that inundation duration and growing season length was likely controlling the lower limit of sedge vegetation. Salix spp. distribution was likely controlled primarily by maximum depth and secondarily by inundation duration. Hydroperiod graphs provide a simple way of relating key hydrologic variables to the distribution of wetland vegetation, and to predict vegetation response to future reservoir water levels.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2013	33	3					431	444		10.1007/s13157-013-0401-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-013-0401-5													WOS:000318797900005

Platypuses were equipped with activity loggers or time-depth recorders, which allowed constant recordings for up to 48 days. The recordings revealed an unexpectedly high variety of foraging behaviors. Although nocturnal activity, as reported from other habitats, was still predominant, diurnal activity as well as highly fragmented activity patterns were common. Mean foraging duration was 12.4 h/day, with some animals foraging continuously for up to 29.8 h. Daily emergence and return times as well as durations of daily foraging trips varied considerably. At least 2 animals showed a distinct shift in activity pattern related to the lunar cycle. Season and water temperature affected platypus behavior. Foraging durations were longer and activity levels were higher in winter. In contrast to observations in river systems, temporal separation likely served as a mechanism to avoid intraspecific competition, and was particularly important for adult males during the breeding season. Dominant males were preferentially nocturnal, whereas lower-ranked males adopted more variable or fragmented activity patterns.																			0022-2372	1545-1542				DEC	2009	90	6					1350	1356		10.1644/08-MAMM-A-355R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1644/08-MAMM-A-355R.1													WOS:000273080600009
J	Bradic, H				Bradic, Haris			The Autonomous House, Sarajevo	NEW ARCH-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ARCHITECTURE												This Paper is a presentation of an "energy autonomous" residential villa near Sarajevo. The house is located in Nisici, a plateau ca. 30km from Sarajevo. The parcel lies on an altitude of 951m, with longitude of 18 degrees 30'38.14" and latitude of 44 degrees 04'23.17". It is a 30-dunum southwest oriented plot, located within natural environment dominated by beautiful scenery with coniferous and deciduous trees and wild pastures. In spring, a natural lake is formed here thanks to accumulation of rainfall. The house is a residential unit that provides comfortable living, resting and recreation. The total area of the house is 420m(2), which is functionally laid out into public and private zones across three floors: partially buried basement, ground floor and first floor. This forms playful architecture, materialized with nearby wood, stone and white plaster. Use of nearby autochthonous recyclable materials in construction of both the exterior and the interior is very important. All visible wooden elements are made of fir/spruce wood and coated with biological oils to preserve the wood structure. The same wood is used in the interior (for floors and walls). Besides the visual and technical characteristics of this house, special attention was also given to the relationship between the house and its microlocation, that is, its potential in terms of exploitation of renewable energy sources. The idea was to develop a concept of "energy autonomous structure" that will completely rely on renewable energy sources. The concept of adjusting a house to fit the location requires proper orientation of its transparent parts towards the south to allow the house to absorb the solar energy during winter periods. The north side is completely closed, with the U-value below 0,10W/m(2). The external envelope has been designed to exploit the renewable energy potential of the site. Micro-climate analysis was carried out based on the on-site measurements and the data from the Hydro-meteorological Institute of FBiH. All of the above resulted in a unique energy concept that uses several energy sources, including the sun, wind and ground, to meet the energy needs of the house. The total simulated energy need of the house is 14kWh/m(2)/year. A network of mutually related energy sources was established, complementing each other throughout the year and constantly providing energy to the entire house. Electricity surplus (especially the one generated from the sun) is to be sent to the grid for local purposes.																			2198-7688					DEC	2014	1	2					112	118		10.14621/tna.20140206	http://dx.doi.org/10.14621/tna.20140206													WOS:000436625300006

The morphology of supraglacial lake ogives	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Supraglacial lakes on grounded regions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets sometimes produce 'lake ogives' or banded structures that sweep downstream from the lakes. Using a variety of remote-sensing data, we demonstrate that lake ogives originate from supraglacial lakes that form each year in the same bedrock-fixed location near the equilibrium-line altitude. As the ice flows underneath one of these lakes, an 'image' of the lake is imprinted on the ice surface both by summer-season ablation and by superimposed ice (lake ice) formation. Ogives associated with a lake are sequenced in time, with the downstream ogives being the oldest, and with spatial separation equal to the local annual ice displacement. In addition, lake ogives can have decimeter- to meter-scale topographic relief, much like wave ogives that form below icefalls on alpine glaciers. Our observations highlight the fact that lake ogives, and other related surface features, are a consequence of hydrological processes in a bedrock-fixed reference frame. These features should arise naturally from physically based thermodynamic models of supraglacial water transport, and thus they may serve as fiducial features that help to test the performance of such models.

Controls on rapid supraglacial lake drainage in West Greenland: an Exploratory Data Analysis approach	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The controls on rapid surface lake drainage on the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) remain uncertain, making it challenging to incorporate lake drainage intomodels of GrIS hydrology, and so to determine the ice-dynamic impact of meltwater reaching the ice-sheet bed. Here, we first use a lake area and volume tracking algorithm to identify rapidly draining lakes within West Greenland during summer 2014. Second, we derive hydrological, morphological, glaciological and surface-mass-balance data for various factors that may influence rapid lake drainage. Third, these factors are used within Exploratory Data Analysis to examine existing hypotheses for rapid lake drainage. This involves testing for statistical differences between the rapidly and non-rapidly draining lake types, as well as examining associations between lake size and the potential controlling factors. This study shows that the two lake types are statistically indistinguishable for almost all factors investigated, except lake area. Thus, we are unable to recommend an empirically supported, deterministic alternative to the fracture area threshold parameter for modelling rapid lake drainage within existing surface-hydrology models of the GrIS. However, if improved remotely sensed datasets (e.g. ice-velocitymaps, climate model outputs) were included in future research, it may be possible to detect the causes of rapid drainage.

Alona had a density peak in early June on reeds (emergent) and in late June on Potamogeton malaianus (submerged). In summer, Alona density remained low in both habitats. Although density was positively correlated with the abundance of epiphytic algae, the birth rate was constant and no correlation between algal abundance and clutch size was detected. In a field experiment using ropes as an artificial substrate covered with high and low densities of epiphytic algae as food, more Alona attached to the ropes with the high density of algae. These results suggest that Alona may select food-rich habitats and migrate seasonally, and that migration is an important factor in the population dynamics of epiphytic chydorid cladocerans such as Alona. In Lake Suwa, Alona may migrate from the reed zone to the submerged macrophyte zone in June.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2004	5	1					17	23		10.1007/s10201-003-0110-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0110-5													WOS:000220834700003

Lake-Bottom Seismograph Observations of Microseisms in Yellowstone Lake	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Ambient-noise records from a seismograph deployed in Yellowstone Lake during July-August 2016 contain high-amplitude signals in the 0.4-1.1 Hz frequency band, which exhibit strong diurnal variations. These diurnal amplitude variations are highly coherent with wind-speed data from a meteorological station on the lake's northern shore, and as the wind builds over the course of a typical summer day, the amplitude and period of the microseism signal progressively increase, consistent with the evolution of a gravity-wave amplitude spectrum. The peak spectral levels are at frequencies of similar to 1.0 Hz, which is roughly twice the peak frequency of a fetch-limited wavefield given the 10-19 km fetch to our lake-floor station, suggesting the signals represent double-frequency microseisms. The similar to 3.4 hr lag observed between wind speed and seismic noise levels are consistent with this interpretation.																			0895-0695	1938-2057				MAY-JUN	2019	90	3					1200	1208		10.1785/0220180242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0220180242													WOS:000465502500014

Increased utilisation of shallow groundwater could help towards achieving multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) by positively impacting poverty, hunger, and health. However, these shallow aquifers are little studied and poorly understood, partly due to a paucity of existing hydrogeological information in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. This study develops a hydrogeological conceptual model for Dangila woreda (district) in Northwest Ethiopia, based on extensive field investigations and implementation of a citizen science programme. Geological and water point surveys revealed a thin (3-18 m) weathered volcanic regolith aquifer overlying very low permeability basalt. Hydrochemistry suggested that deep groundwater within fractured and scoriaceous zones of the basalt is not (or is poorly) connected to shallow groundwater. Isotope analysis and well monitoring indicated shallow groundwater flow paths that are not necessarily coincident with surface water flow paths. Characteristics of the prevalent seasonal floodplains are akin to "dambos" that are well-described in literature for Southern Africa.

This research is transferrable to the shallow volcanic regolith aquifers that overlie a substantial proportion of Ethiopia and are prevalent throughout the East African Rift and in several areas elsewhere on the continent.

For last few years hydrological regime of the lake catchment has been changed dramatically which was caused by functioning nearby peat mine and longer autumn drought periods for following years. Progressing macrophytes succession leaded complete emergent macrophytes overgrowth of the lake beginning from 2000. The analyses include records of previous samples and data for morphology, water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton and macrophytes. The trophic status of Gorbacz Lake was verified compare to the previous studies. The results indicate that even with minimum amount of water Gorbacz Lake itself still keeps its dystrophic character with increasing of water color and of DOC, biogenic substances, chlorophyll a concentrations. Humic State Index (HSI) and hydrochemical dystrophy index (HDI) confirm the dystrophic status of the lake with values 71.3 and 76.2 respectively. Both typical phytoplankton representatives of eutrophic and dystrophic waters were recorded. Very high diversity of desmids in the telmatoplankton, indicates the observed process of shallowing in the reservoir. Planktonic crustacean fauna was represented by small filtrators. Rotifera community was strongly dominated by Trichocerca simonei. The article concludes with the main causes of the observed changes and some future remarks for the lake state.

The species has an interesting life history because winter-spawning adults migrate over long distances to form spawning aggregations, a behaviour which should maintain genetic homogeneity across large spatial scales. Availability of the reported microsatellites will facilitate the investigation of population genetic structure with regard to postglacial colonization history and conservation strategies. The primers were screened on 30 individuals from a natural population (Lake Constance, southern Germany), revealing three to 24 alleles per locus with expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.48 to 0.93.

The densities of bivalves, damselfly nymphs, snails, dragonfly nymphs, nematodes, and crayfish did not differ significantly between years. Five taxa (dipteran larvae, hemipterans, Rana sp. tadpoles, Bluegill [Lepomis macrochirus], and coleopteran larvae) were observed in 2002 but not in 2001. For all taxa, densities in Wood Duck Pond tended to be lower than those reported in other nearby ponds. Thus, although recovery from the winterkill was progressing, the fauna of this small permanent pond was still affected two years later.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2005	20	1					201	203		10.1080/02705060.2005.9664955	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2005.9664955													WOS:000227202200026

Analyses of remotely sensed open-water temperatures with sinusoidal models produced estimates of T-P and J(P) predominately better than other models. Those estimates were analyzed for lake and climate patterns. Linear mixed effects regression produced a significant model of T-P with fixed positive effects for mean July and annual air temperatures and lake perimeter, but negative effects with mean July and annual percent cloud cover, mean annual precipitation, range of monthly mean global clear sky radiation, area, and elevation. Subsets of the estimates with mean, maximum, or Secchi depth values produced similarly significant models with negative depth coefficients. J(P) was relatively invariant but small, significant lake and climate effects were detected. The best models identified in our analyses will be useful tools for forecasting how climate change will alter aspects of the limnetic seasonal water temperature cycle that strongly influences the species composition and productivity of their fisheries.

The natural history and fisheries ecology of Lake Chilwa, southern Malawi	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Chilwa produces between zero and 24,000 metric tons of fish per year, making it one of the most productive but variable lakes in Africa. The size of the lake varies seasonally and among years, sometimes drying completely. Its surrounding wetland and floodplain provide habitat for a diversity of birds and economically valuable grasses and reeds. When the lake has water, there is considerable activity on its shores and temporary fishing villages spring up. People move in and out of the lake basin in concert with these seasonal and longer term changes. This paper examines the environmental dynamics of Lake Chilwa and its surrounding wetlands, presents an overview of the socio-economic context of the area and discusses threats to this resilient system that might occur as a result of climate change. We conclude that management of Lake Chilwa must place the lake in the wider economic and ecological system in which it is situated. Ultimately, land-use practices within the basin present more of a threat to the resilience of the fishery and people's livelihoods than overfishing or a strict focus on the lake's resources. These perspectives present significant challenges to conventional fisheries governance. (C) 2010 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To determine the time at which the morphological deviations from a normal gonadal arrangement develop, we conducted experiments designed to: (1) examine whether the morphologic gonadal variations develop during or after gonadal differentiation, and (2) characterise the entire ontogenetic gonadal development in whitefish from hatching until maturity. For these experiments, whitefish were reared under controlled conditions with distinct water sources and temperature regimes (Lake Thun water: 4 to 22 degrees C; spring water: 8 to 9 degrees C). Gonadal development in the spring water group was clearly delayed with respect to age, but similar to the Lake Thun water group with respect to degree-days in Celsius (degrees D). Undifferentiated gonads were first seen at 65 d post-hatch and 491 degrees D. Ovarian differentiation (starting from 1734 to 1820 degrees D) preceded testicular differentiation (starting from 1989 to 3673 degrees D). The first fish with mature germ cells were recognised at 8163 to 8356 degrees D. Morphological gonadal deviations became evident during gonadal differentiation. Constrictions and asymmetries developed for the first time in the first (0+) or second (1+) year-of-life, at a body length of 13 to 18 cm. Aplasia and compartmentation were recorded in the third (2+) year-of-life at a body length of 16 to 18 cm. Intersex fish occurred at a frequency of 8 to 9% during gonadal sex differentiation. Because no evidence for the presence of exogenic endocrine active substances was revealed, we suppose that there is a naturally increased mosaic intersex condition in whitefish during the ontogenetic gonadal differentiation process.

J	Tatarkiewicz, D				Tatarkiewicz, Dawid			Analysis of the emergence of the Scarce Chaser Libellula fulva OF Muller, 1764 (Odonata: Libellulidae)	AQUATIC INSECTS												The Scarce Chaser (Libellula fulva) is widespread in Europe and in many regions is relatively common. It is also abundant in the lake districts of western and northern Poland. Although the species frequently occurs in large numbers its biology is poorly known. Emergence of L.fulva was investigated in this study as a contribution to the life history of the species. Studies were carried out in the vicinity of Chojno (52 degrees 41N, 16 degrees 12E) on the edge of the Notecka Forest in 2003 and 2004. The stem habitat of the population is a stream with the adjacent swamps. Libellula fulva belongs to the spring species sensu Corbet (1999). The emergence of the studied population lasted 19days (between 18 May and 5 June) and 31days (between 13 May and 12 June) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. It was characterised by synchronous and, especially in the first phase, mass emergence. The high synchronisation is reflected in the fact that 50% of the population had emerged by the seventh (in 2003) and the fifth (in 2004) days of the process. This is vital to the imagines, which mature and return to the water body as soon as possible to reproduce. Timing of the end of emergence depends on atmospheric conditions during its duration and the conditions preceding the start of emergence on a given day. In the daily course there is a tendency for emergence to finish as soon as possible. Extension of the emergence is synonymous with increased mortality in the dragonfly population caused by predators.																			0165-0424	1744-4152				DEC 1	2012	34	3-4					173	193		10.1080/01650424.2013.800556	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650424.2013.800556													WOS:000328106500001

Almost all were found in streams, but some inhabited wave-swept lake margins and spring-ponds. Adults and larvae of eight species were collected almost exclusively from submerged, decaying wood, while those of most other species inhabited rock or gravel substrates, especially in stream riffles, and only occasionally were found in wood; adults of three species of Dubiraphia were found also on macrophytes.

Hydroclimate variability in the Madagascar and Southeast African summer monsoons at the Mid- to Late-Holocene transition	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The 4.2 ka event at the Mid- to Late-Holocene transition is often regarded as one of the largest and best documented abrupt climate disturbances of the Holocene. The event is most clearly manifested in the Mediterranean and Middle East as a regional dry anomaly beginning abruptly at 4.26 kyr BP and extending until 3.97 kyr BP. Yet the impacts of this regional drought are often extended to other regions and sometimes globally. In particular, the nature and spatial extent of the 4.2 ka event in the tropics have not been established. Here, we present a new stalagmite stable isotope record from Anjohikely, northwest Madagascar. Growing between 5.22 and 2.00 kyr BP, stalagmite AK1 shows a hiatus between 4.31 and 3.93 kyr BP (+/- 40 and +/- 35 yrs), replicating a hiatus in another stalagmite from nearby Anjohibe, and therefore indicating a significant drying at the Mid- to Late-Holocene transition. This result is the opposite to wet conditions at the 8.2 ka event, suggesting fundamentally different forcing mechanisms. Dry conditions are also recorded in sediment cores in Lake Malawi, Lake Masoko and the Tatos Basin on Mauritius, also in the southeast African monsoon domain. However, no notable event is recorded at the northern (equatorial East Africa) and eastern (Rodrigues) peripheries of the monsoon domain, while a wet event is recorded in sediment cores at Lake Muzi and Mkhuze Delta to the south. The spatial pattern is largely consistent with the modern rainfall anomaly pattern associated a with weak Mozambique Channel Trough and a northerly austral summer Intertropical Convergence Zone position. Within age error, the observed peak climate anomalies overlap with the 4.2 ka event. However regional hydrological change consistently begins earlier than a 4.26 kyr BP event onset. Gradual hydrological change frequently begins around 4.5 kyr BP, raising doubt as to whether any coherent regional hydrological change is merely coincident with the 4.2 ka event or part of a global climatic anomaly.

Creation and Validation of a Comprehensive 1° by 1° Daily Gridded North American Dataset for 1900-2009: Snowfall	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												This study details the creation of a gridded snowfall dataset for North America, with focus on the quality of the interpolated product. Daily snowfall amounts from National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program stations and Meteorological Service of Canada surface stations are interpolated to 18 by 18 grids from 1900 to 2009 and examined for data record length and quality. The interpolation is validated spatially and temporally through the use of stratified sampling and k-fold cross-validation analyses. Interpolation errors average around 0.5 cm and range from less than 0.01 to greater than 2.5 cm. For most locations, this is within the measurement sensitivity. Grid cells with large variations in elevation experience higher errors and should be used with caution. A new gridded snowfall climatology is presented based on in situ observations that capture seasonal and interannual variability in monthly snowfall over most of the North American land area from 1949 to 2009. The Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network is used as an independent set of point data that is compared to the gridded product. Errors are mainly in the form of the gridded data underestimating snowfall compared to the point data. The spatial extent, temporal length, and resolution of the dataset are unprecedented with regard to observational snowfall products and will present new opportunities for examining snowfall across North America.

As a result of periods of high precipitation, sediment confined at the bottom of karstic basins migrates from 45 m depth to approximately 25 m depth. Fluidization processes are associated to monthly rainfall 1.5 to 4.5 times larger than the long-term mean (1970- 1999). As a result of a fluidization event, the water column of the lake maintains the particle volume concentrations of suspended sediment (pVC) as high as 44 mul/l, which is similar to8-29 times larger than the usual values of pVC.

Influenza viruses were isolated mainly from fecal samples of dabbling ducks in their nesting places in central Alaska. The numbers of subtypes of 108 influenza virus isolates were 1 H2N3, 37 H3N8, 55 H4N6, 1 H7N3, 1 H8N2, 1 H10N2, 11 H10N7, and H10 N9. influenza viruses were also isolated from water samples of the lakes where they nest. Even in September of 1994 when the most ducks had left for migration to south, viruses were still isolated from the lake water. Phylogenetic analysis of the NP genes of the representative isolates showed that they belong to the North American lineage of avian influenza viruses, suggesting that the majority of the waterfowls breeding in central Alaska migrate to North America and not to Asia. The present results support the notion that influenza viruses have been maintained in waterfowl population by water-borne transmission and revealed the mechanism of year-by-year perpetuation of the viruses in the lakes where they breed.					kawaoka, yoshihiro/JOZ-2295-2023; OKAZAKI, Katsunori/H-6727-2019; Webster, Robert/B-9176-2015; Kida, Hiroshi/F-7244-2012; Takada, Ayato/A-6679-2012	Okazaki, Katsu/0000-0002-5390-2580; 													0304-8608	1432-8798					1995	140	7					1163	1172		10.1007/BF01322743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01322743								7646350					WOS:A1995RK39400001

Lake Sturgeon Geographic Range, Distribution, and Migration Patterns in the Saskatchewan River	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined geographic range, distribution, and migration patterns of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens within the largest contiguous section of the Saskatchewan River system in Saskatchewan, Canada. Lake Sturgeon use portions of the North, South, and main-stem Saskatchewan River during the summer months. The Forks area was observed to be an overwintering area. Lake Sturgeon were observed to migrate each year, and all Lake Sturgeon migrated at least once in the 3-year study. Lake Sturgeon were observed to undertake significant migrations (> 100 km/year) using all three rivers. Migration initiation date was consistent over the 3-year period, whereas migration return date was more variable and may be linked to river flow rate. No significant differences in distance covered between years were identified, but Lake Sturgeon tended to migrate longer distances in years when flow rates were higher. Finally, the spatial extent of Lake Sturgeon in the Saskatchewan River System appears to be larger than that of many previously studied river and lake populations. This study provides important insights into Lake Sturgeon distribution and migration patterns within large prairie rivers, increasing our basic knowledge of this unique fish species in understudied river systems, and provides important information for conservation within their historic range.

The highest frequencies are observed in the Peloponnese and Ionian Islands, followed by Central Greece and the North Aegean, characterized by dense faulting and frequent strong earthquakes. EQHAs are classified into six main types, with hydraulic variations being the most common. About 77% of earthquakes produced only one or two types of EQHA, suggesting localized hydrogeological effects, while only a few induced multiple types. Strong events (M-w = 6.0-7.0), often historic, generated the broadest variety, highlighting the influence of local geological, hydrological, and tectonic conditions on magnitude alone. Springs and wells, representing 81% of the cases, dominate the affected systems, while lakes and rivers respond less often but significantly. Most EQHAs occur in Greece's second seismic hazard zone (74%) due to its larger geographic area. EQHAs primarily develop in karstic and porous formations but also appear in impermeable rocks due to fracturing or karst. Larger earthquakes trigger anomalies at greater distances (>100 km). Though rarely fatal, EQHAs can damage water infrastructure, contaminate supplies, and cause shortages, underscoring the need for systematic monitoring and post-earthquake water resource management.																				2076-3263				SEP 17	2025	15	9							367	10.3390/geosciences15090367	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences15090367													WOS:001581495600001
J	Amann, B; Szidat, S; Grosjean, M				Amann, Benjamin; Szidat, Soenke; Grosjean, Martin			A millennial-long record of warm season precipitation and flood frequency for the North-western Alps inferred from varved lake sediments: implications for the future	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The recent warming of the global climate is well recognized. However, does a warmer climate also mean a moister climate? Does dry get drier and wet get wetter? There are important questions as they relate to changes in the water cycle and impacts the water resources as well as the frequency and intensity of storms and floods in the near future. In Europe, regional climate models do not show consistent and robust results for future hydroclimatic changes and how extreme events will evolve in response to future climate change. Paleo-hydroclimatic data from natural archives are one of the few means to assess such changes in the longer context. Here, we present an annually-resolved record of warm season (MJJA) precipitation and summer flood frequency from the varved (annually laminated) sediments of proglacial Lake Oeschinen (46 degrees 30'N-7 degrees 44'E, 1580 m, NW Swiss Alps) back to AD 884. These data sets are inferred from the thickness of annual sediment deposits and the occurrence of flood event layers in the sediments. The chronology of the sediment record is based on multiple varve counts and validated with historical floods chronicled in written documents (back to the 14th century) and C-14 AMS dates. The precipitation record shows pronounced interannual to centennial variability with humid warm season phases between AD 920-950, AD 1100-1180, AD 1300-1400, AD 1590-1650, AD 1700-1790, AD 1820-1880, and AD 1960-2008. Driest conditions are reconstructed for AD 960-1080, AD 1250-1300 and for AD 1880-1900. Our precipitation record is consistent with the few multi-centennial warm-season precipitation records available for Europe. We did not find a persistent relationship between warm-season precipitation and temperature. In contrast, results show that the relation between precipitation and temperature has oscillated between positive correlations (warmer gets wetter, cooler gets drier) and negative correlations (warmer gets drier, cooler gets wetter),with a highly significant (chi(2) = 99%) multidecadal (60-70 yrs) periodicity over the last millennium. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are changes in the weather type statistics or the within-weather-type variability, which influence the combinations between precipitation and temperature over continental central Europe and operate at multidecadal scales. Such multidecadal effects might also be important for precipitation scenarios in the Alpine area under future warming. Our record of flood frequency suggests more frequent floods under cool and humid climate during the warm seasons. This picture is consistent with other studies from small and medium size catchments at mid- and high elevations in the Alpine area. However, the 13th century reveals a period with high flood frequency during warm and moderately dry (average precipitation) conditions. This anomalous situation is currently not understood; nonetheless, this is also one out of several possible scenarios for the future. From the different combinations found in our record, we conclude that the relation between floods, precipitation and temperature and, in consequence, future projections remain poorly constrained.

Previous measurements show that a 3.5-km long segment of the aquifer lost a large volume of water (26,000-65,000 m(2) in cross section) between spring 2012 and spring 2013, compared to annual meltwater accumulation of 6000-15,000 m(2). The water is thought to have entered the crevasses, but whether the water reached the bed or refroze within the ice sheet is unknown. We used a thermo-visco-elastic model for crevasse propagation to calculate the depths and volumes of these water-filled crevasses. We compared our model output to data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), which reveals the near-surface geometry of specific crevasses, and WorldView images, which capture the surface expressions of crevasses across our 1.5-km study area. We found a best fit with a shear modulus between 0.2 and 1.5 GPa within our study area. We show that surface meltwater can drive crevasses to the top surface of the firn aquifer (similar to 20m depth), whereupon it receives water at rates corresponding to the water flux through the aquifer. Our model shows that crevasses receiving firn-aquifer water hydrofracture through to the bed, similar to 1000m below, in 10-40 days. Englacial refreezing of firn-aquifer water raises the average local ice temperature by similar to 4 degrees C over a ten-year period, which enhances deformational ice motion by similar to 50m year(-1), compared to the observed surface velocity of similar to 200m year(-1). The effect of the basal water on the sliding velocity remains unknown. Were the firn aquifer not present to concentrate surface meltwater into crevasses, we find that no surface melt would reach the bed; instead, it would refreeze annually in crevasses at depths < 500 m. The crevasse field downstream of the firn aquifer likely allows a large fraction of the aquifer water in our study area to reach the bed. Thus, future studies should consider the aquifer and crevasses as part of a common system. This system may uniquely affect ice-sheet dynamics by routing a large volume of water to the bed outside of the typical runoff period.					; Brucker, Ludovic/ACJ-3763-2022; Nowicki, Sophie/D-5114-2012; Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008; Lilien, David/HNQ-6542-2023	Kehrl, Laura/0000-0002-4926-2015; Poinar, Kristin/0000-0002-1386-9659; Lilien, David/0000-0001-8667-8020; Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X; 														2296-6463				FEB 7	2017	5								5	10.3389/feart.2017.00005	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2017.00005													WOS:000393612400001

THE BASS PARASITES OF ONEIDA LAKE, 80 YEARS LATER	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												A survey of largemouth (Micropterus salmoides) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) parasite communities in Oneida Lake, New York, was conducted in the summer of 2012 and compared to an earlier survey conducted by Van Cleave and Mueller during the summers of 1929 to 1931. The component helminth communities between surveys were 31% similar in composition for largemouth and 28% similar for smallmouth bass. Between species, the component helminth communities were considerably more similar in the present survey (71%) than in the survey conducted by Van Cleave and Mueller (47%). Seven species reported by Van Cleave and Mueller were present in this survey and 21 species are new records for the bass of Oneida Lake. Van Cleave and Mueller did not report prevalence values for several taxa (Monogenea, Copepoda, Myxozoa, and a Trichodina sp.) that were important for separation of parasite infracommunities in species space for both bass species. These parasites represented 28% of all species found in the current survey and may be ecologically important. Several species of parasites exhibited differences in prevalence between surveys. Two species (Rhipidocotyle papillosa and Crepidostomum cornutum) were absent from this survey but were reported as common in the 1929-1931 survey and almost certainly represent extirpations that coincide with the loss of their native bivalve hosts from Oneida Lake. Other differences in the parasite communities may also be explained by the ecological disturbances in Oneida Lake over the past 81 yr. The changes in bass parasite communities between surveys emphasize the importance of recognizing the historical nature of parasite communities, especially in ecosystems with a history of large-scale changes. Most importantly our findings suggest that, similar to trends observed in free-living freshwater biotic communities, anthropogenic ecosystem disturbances may homogenize fish parasite communities.

J	Dillon, PJ; Molot, LA				Dillon, PJ; Molot, LA			Long-term phosphorus budgets and an examination of a steady-state mass balance model for central Ontario lakes	WATER RESEARCH												The objective of this study was to evaluate, modify if necessary, and calibrate a mass balance steady-state total phosphorus (TP) model for use in the Precambrian Shield area of Ontario. Hydrologic data, TP mass balances and lake concentrations data were collected between June 1978 and May 1992 from seven oligotrophic and oligomesotrophic lakes located on the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario. Two of the lakes (Dickie and Harp) had substantial shoreline development; four lakes had alkalinities <25 mu eql(-1). The gross settling or loss coefficient, v, was underestimated when internal load was ignored. Long-term mean rr ranged about three-fold, from 4.7 m yr(-1) in Plastic Lake to 13.7 m yr(-1) in Dickie Lake with an average for six lakes of 7.9 m yr(-1). The exception was Harp Lake where v was 23.2 m yr(-1). The difference in v between heavily developed Dickie and Harp Lakes may have been due to the unusually thick glacial tills in the Harp catchment and their likely ability to retain at least some of the TP from septic effluent. The current inability to predict septic TP retention rates by soils/tills, the highly variable nature of soils/tills, and the decades required to reach equilibrium after installation leave environmental managers with little choice but to apply the ''precautionary principle'' to ensure adequate protection of inland recreational waters and assume that soils do not retain septic TP. There was no evidence that enhanced sedimentation of TP (''oligotrophication'') occurred in any of the three most acidic lakes. In fact, losses via sedimentation were lowest in these lakes. Average retention, R ((input-output)/input) of TP during the ice-free months of May to November was much higher than average R in winter (December-April) in all lakes. Lack of wind-induced mixing, low biological activity and thermal stratification caused by ice cover make it more likely that stream loads are discharged directly from lakes during winter. Seasonal variation in retention suggests that R and v should be higher in warmer climatic zones. There may be no globally valid v, although the data presented here suggest that a regionally applicable estimate of v may be appropriate. The model should only be calibrated with a long-term data set and should be only used to predict long-term, average responses to changes in average TP loading.

Distribution model transferability for a wide-ranging species, the Gray Wolf	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Using existing data can be a reliable and cost-effective way to predict species distributions, and particularly useful for recovering or expanding species. We developed a current gray wolf (Canis lupus) distribution model for the western Great Lakes region, USA, and evaluated the spatial transferability of single-state models to the region. This study is the first assessment of transferability in a wide-ranging carnivore, as well as one of few developed for large spatial extents. We collected 3500 wolf locations from winter surveys in Minnesota (2017-2019), Wisconsin (2019-2020), and Michigan (2017-2020). We included 10 variables: proportion of natural cover, pastures, and crops; distance to natural cover, agriculture, developed land, and water; major and minor road density; and snowfall (1-km res.). We created a regional ensemble distribution by weight-averaging eight models based on their performance. We also developed single-state models, and estimated spatial transferability using two approaches: state cross-validation and extrapolation. We assessed performance by quantifying correlations, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), sensitivities, and two niche similarity indices. The regional area estimated to be most suitable for wolves during winter (threshold = maximum sensitivity/specificity) was 106,465 km(2) (MN = 48,083 km(2), WI = 27,757 km(2), MI = 30,625 km(2)) and correctly predicted 88% of wolf locations analyzed. Increasing natural cover and distance to crops were consistently important for determining regional and single-state wolf distribution. Extrapolation (vs. cross-validation) produced results with the greatest performance metrics, and were most similar to the regional model, yet good internal performance was unrelated to greater extrapolation performance. Factors influencing species distributions are scale-dependent and can vary across areas due to behavioral plasticity. When extending inferences beyond the current occurrence of individuals, assessing variation in ecology such as habitat selection, as well as methodological factors including model performance, will be critical to avoid poor scientific interpretations and develop effective conservation applications. In particular, accurate distribution models for recovering or recovered carnivores can be used to develop plans for habitat management, quantify potential of unoccupied habitat, assess connectivity modeling, and mitigate conflict, facilitating long-term species persistence.					; Beyer, Dean/HTM-6783-2023; Belant, Jerrold/HDM-7749-2022	Beyer, Jr., Dean/0009-0000-1708-4958; 													2045-2322					AUG 8	2022	12	1							13556	10.1038/s41598-022-16121-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16121-6								35941166					WOS:000837764800010

Hydrodynamics were simulated by dynamically coupling a laterally averaged, vertical-plane model, which includes a turbulence closure sub-model, and a one-dimensional river model. The transport of suspended sediment was modified by the inclusion of source/sink terms for resuspension, deposition and settling. The model study has been performed using conditions which are typical of the fall season for the region, and in this case a single sediment grain size was used. The dredged portion of the model domain contains two sills that form as the result of the interaction of storm-induced long-waves at the lake end of the tributary and increased sediment load due to runoff upstream. The model results show flow reversals and significant lake water intrusion upstream even for moderate long-wave amplitudes.																					0-7844-0350-3				1998							781	791																WOS:000085572100055

Frequent floods in the European Alps coincide with cooler periods of the past 2500 years	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Severe floods triggered by intense precipitation are among the most destructive natural hazards in Alpine environments, frequently causing large financial and societal damage. Potential enhanced flood occurrence due to global climate change would thus increase threat to settlements, infrastructure, and human lives in the affected regions. Yet, projections of intense precipitation exhibit major uncertainties and robust reconstructions of Alpine floods are limited to the instrumental and historical period. Here we present a 2500-year long flood reconstruction for the European Alps, based on dated sedimentary flood deposits from ten lakes in Switzerland. We show that periods with high flood frequency coincide with cool summer temperatures. This wet-cold synchronism suggests enhanced flood occurrence to be triggered by latitudinal shifts of Atlantic and Mediterranean storm tracks. This paleoclimatic perspective reveals natural analogues for varying climate conditions, and thus can contribute to a better understanding and improved projections of weather extremes under climate change.					; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014; Schar, Christoph/A-1033-2008; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013	Wirth, Stefanie B./0000-0002-1276-8506; Gilli, Adrian/0000-0003-4193-2157; Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641													2045-2322					SEP 26	2013	3								2770	10.1038/srep02770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep02770								24067733					WOS:000324861200013

The annual amount of sedimental phosphorus relative to that of phosphorus inflow was different for each of the three water bodies: 16% for Lake Shinji, 3% for the Honjo area, and -8% for Lake Nakaumi, as estimated in a 10-year period from January 1993 to December 2002. During the warm season, the quantity of phosphorus released surpassed sedimentation in these three water bodies. The low annual sedimentation ratio in Lake Nakaumi is related to a large seawater backflow resulting in phosphorus removal, in addition to a stable stratified structure promoting phosphorus release from sediment due to oxygen depletion in the lower layer. In Lake Nakaumi, field data shows that if dissolved oxygen at the sediment surface falls below 2.54 mg L(-1), phosphorus release from the sediment begins to be accelerated.

The northern part of the Caspian Sea freezes in the winter. Waters start icing in November and ices spread during December and January. The northern part of the Caspian Sea is covered by ices in severe winters. Ice-covered area is at its maximum during January and February, and then ices begin melting in March and disappear in April. The occurrence of ices must have significant effects on circulation and thermohaline structures as well as ecosystem in the northern Caspian Sea. In the present study, formation of ices is modeled assuming that ices do not move but spread and shrink on water surface. Under the ices, it is assumed that the exchange of momentum flux is impeded and the fluxes of heat and brine salt are given at sea-ice boundary. The ice model was coupled with a hydrostatic model based on MEC (Marine Environmental Committee) Ocean Model developed by the Japan Society of Naval Architect and Ocean Engineers. Numerical simulation was carried out for 20 years to achieve stable seasonal changes in current velocity, water temperature, and salinity. The fluxes of momentum, heat, and salt were estimated by using measurement data at 11 meteorological stations around the Caspian Sea. Inflow of Volga River was taken into account as representative of all the rivers which inflow into the Caspian Sea. Effects of icing event on circulation and thermohaline structures were discussed using the results of numerical simulation in the last year. As a result, the accuracy of predicting water temperature in the northern Caspian Sea was improved by taking the effects of icing event into account. Differences in density in the horizontal direction create several gyres with the effects of Coriolis force. The differences were caused by differences in heat capacity between coastal and open waters, differences in water temperature due to climate, and inflow of rivers in the northern Caspian Sea. The water current field in the Caspian Sea is formed by adding wind-driven current to the dominant density-driven current, which is based on horizontal differences in water temperature and salinity, and Coriolis force.																					978-0-7918-4911-8				2010							221	228																WOS:000290556500028

The occurrence of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) during the early Holocene has recently been reconsidered and seasonal biases have been suggested in the paleoclimatic proxies. High regional variability and a low number of reliable and continuous quantitative reconstructions compared with the oceanic realm further complicate study of the Holocene climate in the continental realm. We analyzed branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), an organic paleothermometer, and palynological signals as part of a multiproxy analysis of the sedimentary record from Lake St Front, in the Massif Central (France). Identification of a shift in brGDGT sources through the Holocene required removing terrigenous influences from the temperature signal. BrGDGT- and pollen-inferred paleotemperature reconstructions (based on the Modern Analog Technique and the Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares method) were compared. Both showed a thermal maximum during the early Holocene followed by a decrease of temperatures. We evaluated biases which could potentially influence the reconstructed signal. There was no evidence for a summer temperature bias either for brGDGT-derived temperatures or for pollen-derived temperatures. The Lake St Front data, in agreement with other regional records, confirm the occurrence of the HTM as a general warm period during the early Holocene followed by mid-Holocene cooling in Western Europe and suggest that seasonal biases are not the main explanation of the Holocene conundrum - the disagreement between model simulations and proxy-based temperature reconstructions for the northern hemisphere.

Seed Abundance for Waterfowl in Wetlands Managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Managed wetlands on public lands in Illinois, United States, provide foraging habitats for migrating and wintering waterfowl. However, few studies have estimated abundances of waterfowl foods in mid-migration regions of North America, yet such information is needed to inform management and conservation decision-making. During 20052007, we used a multistage sampling design to estimate moist-soil plant seed production (kg/ha, dry mass) and energetic carrying capacity at sites managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and modeled variation in seed biomass. Average seed biomass among all sites ranged from 1,030.0 +/- 64.1 (SE) kg/ha in 2005 to 501.5 +/- 124.1 kg/ha in 2007. Our overall estimate (2005-2007) of moist-soil plant seed biomass was precise (691.3 +/- 56.4 kg/ha; CV: 8.2%), equaling 5,128 energetic use-days/ha. This value was similar to or slightly greater than previous estimates from other regions of North America and exceeded the estimate used the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture for waterfowl conservation planning (514 kg/ha). We formulated eight models to predict abundance of moist-soil plant seeds within sampled wetlands. The best approximating model included the number of desirable plant species within wetlands and study year. The second best model included the categorical effect of management intensity and indicated that, although variable, actively managed wetlands produced about 240 kg/ha more seed than those that were passively managed. As with other regions, wetland management practices that encourage diverse plant communities over monotypes and growth of early successional plants should yield substantial increases in waterfowl food abundances at Illinois Department of Natural Resources sites, especially given that only 27% of our study wetlands were actively managed. Such efforts would also help reduce deficits in energetic carrying capacity identified by the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture.

Some Biological Characteristics of Tadpole Shrimp, Triops cancriformis, from Seasonal Pools of West Azarbaijan (Iran)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The tadpole shrimp of genus Triops is a well-known living fossil whose fundamental morphology has been unchanged for 220 million years. We collected specimens of Triops cancriformis in temporary water bodies near the southern part of Urmia Lake (in the Fall of 2005). Some biological characteristics of this Triops were investigated. The feeding regime of T. cancriformis was found to be related to the fauna and flora of the temporary pools. Invertebrates and animal detritus were found to constitute major part of the feeding regime. The existence of Triops cysts and particles in the gut also showed certain degree of cannibalism. Morphological and histological investigations showed that the population of T. cancriformis was female and there was only one male among 400 samples collected. Observation of sperm among follicle ducts of a few samples indicated some degree of hermaphrodity, but the animal seemed to reproduce mainly through parthenogenesis. Fecundity, varying from 100 to 2500 cysts, was with a few exceptions related to the body size. The average cyst diameter was 400+/-85 mu m.

Thermal stratification is weak and comprises only about 8% of the bottom surface. In summer, the epilimnion is oversaturated with oxygen due to intensive phytoplankton growth (chlorophyll a up to 80.2 mu g l(-1)), while conditions in the hypolimnion are anaerobic. The high concentration of ammonium nitrogen and low N:P ratio stimulated intense growth of cyanobacteria in the period from June to November. The domination of rotifers in the metazooplankton and low diversity and biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates was the cause of low top-down pressure of these organisms on the phytoplankton. The most advantageous restoration measures were identified to improve water quality and make the recreational use of the lake possible.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018; Budzyńska, Agnieszka/AAC-6860-2020	Dondajewska-Pielka, Renata/0000-0002-6761-0669; Podsiadlowski, Stanislaw/0000-0002-1712-6174; Szelag-Wasielewska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-7542-6490; Kowalczewska-Madura, Katarzyna/0000-0003-0243-1085; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Budzynska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-4983-1940													1730-413X					SEP	2010	39	3					65	80		10.2478/v10009-010-0040-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10009-010-0040-6													WOS:000282362900006

Obtained data series were analysed by Spearman's rank correlation method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method and Renkonen's similarity test. UPMGA method was used for single linkage clustering of the lakes based on the abundance of phyto- and zooplankton taxa. Low similarity between the obtained cluster trees and hydrological grouping was stated indicating minor impact of the flooding hydrology on summer plankton communities of these lakes. Significant correlation between the flooding frequency and several physicochemical and biological parameters was found. Six main factors, which explain observed variations, were extracted by PCA. Significant negative impact of hydrological connectivity on zooplankton species diversity as well as positive impact on Oligochaeta density was stated, whereas other biotic parameters were affected by local factors, such as lake morphology, internal loading of nutrients from sediments, throphic interactions as well as local source of dissolved organic matter.

The ionic content of the lakes was generally low, with conductivity (at 20 degrees C) ranging from 1.1 to 4.7 mS m(-1) and 23% of the lakes had a depleted carbonate buffering system. Major factors governing differences in the lake-water chemistry were bedrock composition and amount of soil and vegetation in their catchment areas. Compared to lakes in the predominantly granitic central part of the Tatra Mountains, lakes in the West Tatra Mountains had higher concentrations of base cations and alkalinity due to the presence of metamorphic rocks in the bedrock. Concentrations of phosphorus, organic carbon, organic nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a were highest in forest lakes and decreased with decreasing density of vegetation and soil cover in the catchment areas. Concentrations of nitrate showed an opposite trend. Several exceptions to these general patterns in chemical and biological composition were due to exceptional geology or hydrology of the lake catchments.

Light noble gases in 12 meteorites from the Omani desert, Australia, Mauritania, Canada, and Sweden	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												We measured the concentrations and isotopic compositions of He, Ne, and Ar in 14 fragments from 12 different meteorites: three carbonaceous chondrites, six L chondrites (three most likely paired), one H chondrite, one R chondrite, and one ungrouped chondrite. The data obtained for the CV3 chondrites Ramlat as Sahmah (RaS) 221 and RaS 251 support the hypothesis of exposure age peaks for CV chondrites at approximately 9Ma and 27Ma. The exposure age for Shir 033 (CR chondrite) of 7.3Ma is also indicative of a possible CR chondrite exposure age peak. The three L chondrites Jiddat al Harasis (JaH) 091, JaH 230, and JaH 296, which are most likely paired, fall together with Hallingeberg into the L chondrite exposure age peak of approximately 15Ma. The two L chondrites Shelburne and Lake Torrens fall into the peaks at approximately 40Ma and 5Ma, respectively. The ages for Bassikounou (H chondrite) and RaS 201 (R chondrite) are approximately 3.5Ma and 5.8Ma, respectively. Six of the studied meteorites show clear evidence for 3He diffusive losses, the deficits range from approximately 17% for one Lake Torrens aliquot to approximately 45% for RaS 211. The three carbonaceous chondrites RaS 221, RaS 251, and Shir 033 all have excess 4He, either of planetary or solar origin. However, very high 4He/20Ne ratios occur at relatively low 20Ne/22Ne ratios, which is unexpected and needs further study. The measured 40Ar ages fit well into established systematics. They are between 2.5 and 4.5Ga for the carbonaceous chondrites, older than 3.6Ga for the L and H chondrites, and about 2.4Ga for the R chondrite as well as for the ungrouped chondrite. Interestingly, none of our studied L chondrites has been degassed in the 470Ma break-up event. Using the amount of trapped 36Ar as a proxy for noble gas contamination due to terrestrial weathering we are able to demonstrate that the samples studied here are not or only very slightly affected by terrestrial weathering (at least in terms of their noble gas budget).					; Gnos, Edwin/AAI-7477-2020	Hofmann, Beda/0000-0003-2738-8466; Leya, Ingo/0000-0002-3843-6681; Gnos, Edwin/0000-0003-0940-8435													1086-9379	1945-5100				AUG	2013	48	8					1401	1414		10.1111/maps.12142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12142													WOS:000325867500003

Role of the Atmospheric Moisture Budget in Defining the Precipitation Seasonality of the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Precipitation in the Great Lakes region has a distinct seasonal cycle that peaks in early summer, followed by a decline in August and a secondary peak in September. This seasonality is often not captured by models, which necessitates understanding of the driving mechanisms to ascertain the model biases. This study analyzes the atmospheric moisture budget using reanalysis datasets to assess the role of regional evapotranspiration and moisture influx from remote origins in defining the precipitation seasonality, and to understand how the Great Lakes modulate spatial patterns and magnitudes of these components. Specifically, the land-water thermal contrast yields large seasonal variations in the evaporative fluxes and creates distinctive localized spatial patterns of moisture flux divergence. We find considerable month-to-month variations in both evapotranspiration and the net moisture transport through the boundaries, where they play a cooperative (contrasting) role in amplifying (dampening) the moisture content available for precipitation and total precipitable water. Our seasonal analysis suggests that the misrepresentation of the budget quantities in models, for example, in simulation of moisture transport processes and parameterization schemes, can result in an anomalous precipitation behavior and, in some cases, violation of the atmospheric moisture mass balance, resulting in large residual magnitudes. We also identify conspicuous differences in the representation of moisture budget components in the various reanalyses, which can alter their representation of the regional hydroclimates.

Commensalism used by freshwater crayfish species to survive drying in seasonal habitats	INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												Gramastacus insolitus is a very small non-burrowing Australian freshwater crayfish with a restricted distribution, occurring almost exclusively in seasonal habitats throughout its range. It is listed as a threatened species but its strategy for surviving dry periods was unknown. Eight seasonal surveys of crayfish distribution showed that members of G. insolitus were never found at sites that were outside the distribution of two larger burrowing freshwater crayfish species, Geocharax falcata and Cherax destructor. Excavation of 80 burrows of members of G. falcata and C. destructor in three different seasonal habitats in the Grampians National Park, Victoria, Australia, revealed that individuals of G. insolitus found refuge from drying by estivating in cracks and shallow depressions at the side of the main burrow tunnels constructed by larger species. Members of G. insolitus were not found estivating at the surface, such as under fallen wood, nor was it usually found in crayfish burrows unoccupied by the host crayfish. This study indicates that members of G. insolitus are commensal upon larger crayfish species, using their burrows to survive the seasonal drying of their habitat. Conservation strategies for populations of G. insolitus will need to consider co-existing species of burrowing crayfish.					; Robson, Belinda/G-4694-2010	Robson, Belinda/0000-0002-9215-3666; 													1077-8306	1744-7410					2009	128	3					269	275		10.1111/j.1744-7410.2009.00169.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7410.2009.00169.x													WOS:000269806200008

After the reduction in organic matter loading in 1976, the lake initially shifted from a summer clear-water state, most likely reflecting high grazing pressure by large Daphnia species, to a turbid state with extremely high summer mean chlorophyll a (up to 1400 mu g L-1), high pH (up to 10.2), and low zooplankton grazing. Subsequently, a more variable stale with periodically high grazing rates on phytoplankton and bacteria was established. Changes in zooplankton abundance and grazing could be attributed to variations in cyprinid abundance due to a fish kill (probably as a consequence of oxygen depletion) and pi-I-induced variations in fish recruitment and fry survival. The results suggest strong cascading effects of fish on the abundance and size of zooplankton and phytoplankton and on phytoplankton production. A comparatively weak cascading effect on ciliates and bacterioplankton is suggested. Due to high internal loading, only minor changes were observed in lake-water TP after a reduction in external TP loading of approximately 80% in 1982; net retention of TP was still negative 13 years after the loading reduction, despite a short hydraulic retention time of a few weeks. TN, however, decreased proportionally to the TN-loading reduction in 1987, suggesting a fast N equilibration. Only minor improvement in the environmental state of the lake has been observed. We suggest that another decade will be required before the lake is in equilibrium with present external P loading.

J	Iglikowska, A; Namiotko, T				Iglikowska, Anna; Namiotko, Tadeusz			The non-marine Ostracoda of Lapland: changes over the past century	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Novel faunistic data are presented from the poorly explored area of northern Lapland and comparisons are made between the present day ostracod diversity and historical records from a century ago. Twenty sites were sampled across Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish Lapland: eight to the west of the Scandinavian Mountain range, where the climate is milder under the influence of the Gulfstream, and 12 sites in the slope area east of these mountains, where the impact of the continental climate is stronger The sample sites were mainly peat bogs fed by springs (the dominant habitat type in the study area), but also included helocrene springs, ditches, ponds and the littoral zone of lakes. In total 4376 individuals belonging to 16 species were collected. The most widespread and abundant species were Cyclocypris ovum, Candona candida and Pseudocandona rostrata, whereas Cyclocypris serena, Cryptocandona vavrai and Eucypris pigra were least abundant. The diversity of the ostracod assemblages to the west and to the east of the Scandinavian Mountains was significantly different, as measured by the Shannon diversity index. Mean values were 0.36 (western slopes) and 0.84 (eastern slopes). Three assemblage types were distinguished using UPGMA cluster analysis, with C. ovum, C. candida and P. rostrata as the three characteristic species. However, no statistically significant differences were revealed between the ostracod site assemblages when grouped geographically into west and east of the Scandinavian Mountains. Our results did not show any significant correlation between the Bray-Curtis similarity of the ostracod assemblages and the geographical separation between sites. The most marked difference in ostracod diversity between the present data and the records from the beginning of the 20th century seems to be a retreat of some Arctic species from the Lapland area and a shift of a few eurytopic species further to the north of Lapland. Possible factors influencing this shift are discussed.

J	Hu, Y; Xiao, J; He, WX; Gao, XY				Hu Yong; Xiao Juan; He Wenxiang; Gao Xiaoyang			Application of high frequency lake level change in the prediction of tight sandstone thin reservoir by sedimentary simulation	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The reservoir distribution of block X in Ordos Basin is mainly controlled by the lake level change. The frequent rise and fall of lake level results in the thin interbedded reservoir. Because the seismic data is not sensitive to tight sandstone and it is difficult to predict thin reservoir, this paper uses the Sedimentary Simulation Technology Based on the principle of sequence stratigraphy to predict thin reservoir in the study area. In the process of sediment simulation, the key to this study is to obtain the accurately high-frequency lake level change curve (The frequency of curve is consistent with that of logging, which depends on the number of vertical grids in the process of sedimentary simulation) and reflect it in the model. Because there is only one well in the study area and the data is relatively scarce, the conventional analysis and test data are difficult to provide the characteristics of lake level change. Therefore, this paper uses the INPEFA (Integrated Prediction Error Filter Analysis) technology to analyze the high frequency lake level change. Through the INPEFA processing of GR curve, the obtained lake level change has a clear trend of change, which can directly see the macro change of lake level and the secondary change of lake level in the stratum. On the premise of obtaining the high frequency lake level change curve, in order to ensure that the simulation results can reflect the characteristics of thin layer, combined with the formation thickness and the high frequency lake level change curve, the vertical step size is refined (refined to 60), and the sedimentary simulation is carried out. The simulation results show the characteristics of high resolution, the thin layer is in good agreement with the logging results, and the change of sandstone caused by the secondary rise and fall of lake level is also well reflected in the model. According to the characteristics of tight sandstone reservoir, the high-quality reservoir prediction is carried out by using the simulation results, which provides a new idea for tight sandstone exploration in this area.

Latitude and lake size are important predictors of over-lake atmospheric stability	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Turbulent fluxes across the air-water interface are integral to determining lake heat budgets, evaporation, and carbon emissions from lakes. The stability of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) influences the exchange of turbulent energy. We explore the differences in over-lake ABL stability using data from 39 globally distributed lakes. The frequency of unstable ABL conditions varied between lakes from 71 to 100% of the time, with average air temperatures typically several degrees below the average lake surface temperature. This difference increased with decreasing latitude, resulting in a more frequently unstable ABL and a more efficient energy transfer to and from the atmosphere, toward the tropics. In addition, during summer the frequency of unstable ABL conditions decreased with increasing lake surface area. The dependency of ABL stability on latitude and lake size has implications for heat loss and carbon fluxes from lakes, the hydrologic cycle, and climate change effects.

J	Daiyrov, M; Narama, C				Daiyrov, Mirlan; Narama, Chiyuki			Formation, evolution, and drainage of short-lived glacial lakes in permafrost environments of the northern Teskey Range, Central Asia	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In the Teskey Range of the Tien Shan (Kyrgyz Republic), five outburst flood disasters from short-lived glacial lakes in 2006, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2019 caused severe damages in the downstream part. Short-lived glacial lakes in the Teskey Range grow rapidly and drain within a few months, due to closure and opening of an outlet ice tunnel in an ice-cored moraine complex at the glacier front. In addition to these factors, summer meltwater from the glacier can cause rapid growth. Outburst floods of this lake type are a major hazard in this region and differ from the morainedam failures common to the eastern Himalaya. To clarify how short-lived glacial lakes store and drain water over short periods, we use results from a field survey and satellite data to analyze the water level, area, volume, and discharge of Korumdu lake (2017-2019) as well as satellite data to monitor the appearance of 160 other short-lived lakes (2013-2018). Except in 2016, Korumdu lake appeared and drained within about 1 month during all the summers. Water level data recorded by a data logger and time-lapse camera images show that the lake appeared and expanded suddenly from July to August in 2017-2019. The timing of lake appearance indicates that the lake formed when an outlet ice tunnel (subsurface channel) drainage was blocked by depositions of an ice-debris mixture due to ice melting and not by freezing of stored water. For 2017, we used uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-derived digital surface models (DSMs) and water levels, finding that the lake's volume reached 234 000 m(3) within 29 d, and then the water discharged for 17 d at a maximum rate of 0.66 m(3)/s. This discharge rate is more than 20 times smaller than those found earlier (2006-2014) for four short-lived lakes of tunnel type in this region. We argue that this large variation in discharge rates is due to variation in the dimensions of the outlet ice tunnels. For the 160 other short-lived glacial lakes, we found that 117 formed during the ice-melt period from July to September. This timing and our findings for Korumdu lake show that these 117 lakes likely formed primarily because deposition of an ice-debris mixture blocked the outlet tunnel, though increased glacial melt would also have contributed. In the Teskey Range, the appearance of short-lived glacial lakes on the moraine complexes at glacier fronts is inevitable in summer when the melting rate is high Similar behavior of short-lived lakes may occur in other mountain regions of Central Asia, such as the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains, wherever ice-cored moraine complexes exist within mountain permafrost zone. Moreover, increasing temperatures may increase both tunnel size and lake-basin size (lake volume), leading to increased hazard potential from such lakes in the future.

To study the bottom-up linkages in arctic lakes, we treated one side of a partitioned lake with inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus for a 6-week period each summer for 6 years starting in the summer of 1985. We took a variety of weekly measurements to determine the impact of the nutrient loading on the lake and continued weekly measurements for 2-6 years after the cessation of nutrient loading to observe the recovery of the treated side. The loading rates (2.91 mmol N m(-2) day(-1) and 0.23 mmol P m(-2) day(-1)) were five times the calculated loading rates for Toolik Lake, located nearby. 2. In all 6 years of nutrient addition, phytoplankton biomass and productivity were greater in the treated sector than the reference sector. In the first 4 years of nutrient addition there was no flux of phosphorus from the mineral-rich sediments. This changed in the last 2 years of nutrient addition as phosphorus was released to the lake. 3. The response of the animal community to increased plant production was mixed. One of the four macro-zooplankton species (Daphnia longiremis) increased in number by about twofold in the first 5 years. However, the copepod Cyclops scutifer showed no response during the treatment phase of the study. The benthic invertebrate response was also mixed. After a 2-year lag time the snail Lymnaea elodes increased in the treated lake sector but chironomids did not. 4. Ecosystem response to fertilisation was not controlled solely by nutrient addition because phosphorus was not recycled from the sediments until the last 2 years of nutrient addition. Phytoplankton still showed the effects of nutrient addition in the recovery period and the hypolimnion of the treated sector was still anaerobic starting at 6 m in 1996.

J	Rietmeijer, FJM				Rietmeijer, Frans J. M.			Quantitative material properties for meteoroids from interplanetary dust particles	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Low-porosity, high-density meteoroids could be more common than porous aggregate meteoroids because hydration of porous aggregates initially embedded in ice is relatively fast even at low temperatures causing the collapse to partially and fully hydrated aggregates. Efficient hydration was possible because the matrix of such aggregates is dominated by highly metastable ferromagnesiosilica dust. Measured H/Fe ratios in comet dust support partial dust hydration. Aggregate densification is expressed in different shapes of the meteor light curve ranging from a humped (compound) to a classical-shape for massive hydrated meteors. (c) 2005 COSPAR.

The suspension is designed to provide a stable platform to keep the wheel treads on tract, to insulate the car and the driver from the surface irregularities and to take part of good handling properties. The surface condition of the lake beds is basically flat without undulations but with inconsistent surface textures and ridges. Spring with nonlinear rate is used with the reason that the resistance builds up roughly proportional to the aerodynamic download for keeping the height more nearly constant. The objective of the work is to produce an efficient method for assisting the design of suspension system. At the initial step, the stiffness and the damping constants are determined based on RMS optimization by following the optimization strategy i.e. to minimize the absolute acceleration respect to the relative displacement of the suspension. Power bond graph technique is then used to model the nonlinearity of the components i.e. spring and dashpot of the suspension system. This technique also enables to incorporate the interactions of dynamic response of the vehicle's body with aerodynamic flow as a result of the base excitation of the ground to the wheels. The simulation is conducted on the platform of Simulink-MATLAB and the interactions amongst the components within the system are observed in time domain to evaluate the effectiveness of the suspension.																			0277-786X		978-0-8194-7912-9				2010	7522								752244	10.1117/12.851304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.851304													WOS:000285572800146
J	GOOSSEN, JP; SEALY, SG				GOOSSEN, JP; SEALY, SG			PRODUCTION OF YOUNG IN A DENSE NESTING POPULATION OF YELLOW WARBLERS, DENDROICA-PETECHIA, IN MANITOBA	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The reproductive success and productivity of a dense nesting population of yellow warblers (D. petechia) were studied during the breeding seasons of 1974-1976 on the forested dune ridge along the south shore of Lake Manitoba, Manitoba. Spring temperatures influenced clutch commencement. The mean clutch size for all years was 4.5. Five-egg clutches prevailed during the 1st part of the breeding season; 4-egg clutches were laid (many in re-nests) later. Annual and seasonal variations in clutch size were not significant. Nest success ranged from 40% (1976)-64% (1974); it was 48% for all years combined. Higher nests were not more successful than low nests. Nest success increased as the breeding season advanced. Five-egg clutches gave rise to the most young. Fewer young were produced per pair on the study area compared to the production of young yellow warblers in less dense populations, but more young were produced per unit of habitat. Predation caused most of the failures. About 25% of the active yellow warbler nests were parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Cowbird parasitism decreased reproductive success.																			0008-3550						1982	96	2					189	199																WOS:A1982PM80700011

Shallow freshwater ecosystems of the circumpolar Arctic	ECOSCIENCE												This review provides a synthesis of limnological data and conclusions from studies on ponds and small lakes at our research sites in Subarctic and Arctic Canada, Alaska, northern Scandinavia, and Greenland. Many of these water bodies contain large standing stocks of benthic microbial mats that grow in relatively nutrient-rich conditions, while the overlying water column is nutrient-poor and supports only low concentrations of phytoplankton. Zooplankton biomass can, however, be substantial and is supported by grazing on the microbial mats as well as detrital inputs, algae, and other plankton. In addition to large annual temperature fluctuations, a short growing season, and freeze-up and desiccation stress in winter, these ecosystems are strongly regulated by the supply of organic matter and its optical and biogeochemical properties. Dissolved organic carbon affects bacterial diversity and production, the ratio between pelagic and benthic primary productivity via light attenuation, and the exposure and photoprotection responses of organisms to solar ultraviolet radiation. Climate warming is likely to result in reduced duration of ice-cover, warmer water temperatures, and increased nutrient supplies from the more biogeochemically active catchments, which in turn may cause greater planktonic production. Predicted changes in the amount and origin of dissolved organic matter may favour increased microbial activity in the water column and decreased light availability for the phytobenthos, with effects on biodiversity at all trophic levels, and increased channelling of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/K-8423-2014	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Bonilla, Sylvia/0000-0002-1772-9899; Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/0000-0002-3324-1017													1195-6860	2376-7626					2011	18	3			SI		204	222		10.2980/18-3-3463	http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/18-3-3463													WOS:000297478200004

(mm) of precipitation have been developed for 1-, 3-, and 6-h periods over the conterminous United States. The frequency fields are analyzed on a rectangular grid with a 20-km mesh. Raw (unsmoothed) frequencies at randomly spaced points were computed from 33 yr (1963-95) of hourly precipitation measurements from approximately 3000 stations composing the U.S. Climatic Hourly Precipitation Network. Initial grids of the raw frequencies were then obtained from objective analyses of the randomly spaced values. The final grids were obtained following the application of smoothing, which was applied spatially over the grid and temporally over consecutive months and consecutive time periods of the day. The smoothing applied for each precipitation category and accumulation period was minimized to retain as much coherent temporal and spatial derail as possible. The detail in the frequencies is greater than that for previous nationwide climatic precipitation analyses of this type. The database was developed for use as a climatological predictor input to a statistically based forecast model for the various categories of precipitation amount, but it should also have other operational or research applications. The monthly frequency fields exhibit known climatic features across the nation and features at small temporal and spatial scales that either have not been previously documented or that clarify those incompletely defined in the published literature. The discussions link both known and new climatic features to physiographic features, such as mountain ridges and valleys, large lakes, and ocean coasts, as well as to the diurnal hearing-cooling cycle. Examples of clarifications of previous findings include the spatial and temporal properties of the eastward migration of summer afternoon precipitation frequency peaks from the Rocky Mountains to the high plains and corresponding aspects of the formation of the Great Plains nocturnal precipitation maximum. New discoveries include a secondary summertime nocturnal precipitation peak in the Texas panhandle, a persistent summer maximum for light precipitation southwest of Lake Superior, and a weak leeshore maximum (minimum) for summertime Lake Michigan precipitation during morning (afternoon) hours. These and other new findings resulted from the fine spatial and temporal scale of the analysis.																			0882-8156					MAR	1998	13	1					25	57		10.1175/1520-0434(1998)013<0025:GCMFOP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1998)013<0025:GCMFOP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000072917800003

Annual primary production values in 1979 and 1980, measured by the 14C-technique, were respectively 422 and 588 g C m-2. autoradiographic analyses showed that more than 95% of the blue-green algae were photosynthetically active, and similar levels occurred for Cryptomonas sp. and the nannoplankton. On the other hand, the occurrence of high biomasses of diatoms was rarely accompanied by a corresponding level of primary production. For instance, the maximum diatom biomass in the autumn of 1979 (38.7 mg fresh weight l-1) included more than 50% of photosynthetically inactive cells. In 11 instances only 10% or less of the diatom plankton could be characterized as photosynthetically active. Two reasons for this phenomenon, were discussed: 1) the exclusion of turbulence in the experimental bottles allowing settling of diatoms and deterioration of their nutrient supply, and 2) presence of an unknown proportion of dead cells, resuspended from the lake sediments by wind.																			0020-9309						1985	70	2					237	246		10.1002/iroh.19850700208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19850700208													WOS:A1985AMZ2700005

To achieve this, water and sediment samples were collected seasonally from three stations over 1 year. Results show that the water quality generally remains within acceptable limits, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Surface Water Quality Management Regulation (SWQMR) standards for dam water. Regarding irrigation suitability, the sodium absorption rate (SAR) and magnesium rate (MgR) indices indicate that the lake is appropriate for irrigation. However, the Kelly index (KI) values are only marginally suitable, and the %Na Index suggests that it is unsuitable for irrigation. The Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) indicates that the lake is free from heavy metal pollution (maximum of 98.72) and is safe for drinking. Based on the Metal Index (MI), Class II results were observed in autumn, while Class I results appeared in the other seasons. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index displayed low values (maximum H ' = 1.354) for the aquatic groups. Overall, the water quality parameters and biodiversity data suggest that the lake exhibits oligotrophic characteristics.

However, the impact of climate change and human activities on groundwater recharge patterns is not understood well. Herein, water samples during different seasons were analysed for delta D and delta O-1(8). Based on HYSPLIT and statistical methods, the results show that groundwater recharge primarily comes from agricultural irrigation return flow and precipitation. During monsoon seasons, precipitation infiltrates and recharges shallow groundwater, while in the autumn irrigation period, evaporated water recharges shallow groundwater via soil infiltration. Spatially, the eastern basin experiences more rainfall recharge, leading to heavy isotope depletion, while irrigation activities in the western basin result in isotopic enrichment. Factors including elevation, evapotranspiration, salinity, and irrigation influence the isotopic composition of groundwater, demonstrating significant regional and seasonal variations. Recharge from high-altitude areas usually leads to isotope depletion, while an increase in potential evapotranspiration enhances the enrichment of delta O-1(8) and delta D. Additionally, the rise in salinity caused by evaporation is closely associated with isotope enrichment, and the infiltration of high-phosphorus concentration irrigation water further promotes isotope enrichment. This study provides new insights into the groundwater recharge characteristics in the Ulansuhai Lake basin and encourages the management of groundwater resources.

We reconstructed the long-term variations of the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water (K-d,K-PAR) in the photosynthetically active region (PAR, 400-700 nm) partly on the basis of measured beam attenuation spectra and partly using regression analysis. From K-d,K-PAR we calculated the depth of the euphotic zone (z(1%)) and the mean light availability in the mixed layer (E-mix). The reconstructed time series of these bio-optical parameters gave a plausible picture of the long-term development of light conditions in the two lakes studied, which was in accordance with their eutrophication history and changes in their water levels. Better light availability in both lakes generally coincided with years of a low water level, and the coincidence was more distinct in the shallower Vortsjarv. Values of E-mix revealed a probable light limitation in Peipsi in autumn and in Vortsjarv throughout the year.

Xiaoheishan Island is located at 37A degrees 58'14aEuro(3)N and 120A degrees 38'46aEuro(3)E in Shandong Province, China. A total of 65 species of phytoplankton belonging to three phyla and 27 genera were identified, with Bacillariophyta having the largest number of species. The annual average chlorophyll a concentration for this area was 3.11 mu g/L, and there occurs a Skeletonema costatum bloom in winter. The Shannon-Weaver indexes (log(2)) of the phytoplankton from all stations were higher than 1, and the Pielou indexes were all higher than 0.3. The results of the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that water temperature, PO (4) (3-) and Cu were the environmental factors that had the greatest influence on the distribution of the phytoplankton community throughout the entire year. Although the concentration of heavy metal is well up to the state standards of the first grade of China (GB 3097-1997), these metals still have an impact on the phytoplankton community from this area.

The results showed that the concentrations of dissolved (FeO-DP), particulate (FeO-PP) and total bioavailable phosphorus (FeO-P) had similar horizontal distribution. The BAP concentrations were the highest in those estuaries in the northern bay. With the decrease of the distance to the estuary or long shore, there was little difference between BAP concentrations in an open lake area. During the observation period, algal blooms occurred in most waters of the northern bay, which was reflected from the high concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a). While they were not highest in the estuarine waters of those major rivers, this is the case for the BAP concentrations. The concentrations of Chl-a had a significantly positive correlation with those of bioavailable phosphorus in the open area of the Meiliang Bay. With the sediment resuspension induced by wind and wave, BAP concentrations increased in a short-term, indicating that the riverine P inputs mainly contribute to the concentrations of BAP in the estuarine water while internal P release was the major source of BAP in the open lake area. In the eutrophic shallow lake, the blooms of alga may cause pH increase and further result in internal P release. The above results showed that the new membrane of FeO/CAM can be used to monitor the concentrations of BAP and provide the scientific justifications for the control strategy of the lake eutrophication.

Given that water temperature is vital for maintaining the integrity of aquatic ecosystems, study-ing the effects of small dams is important. This study aims to understand the effect of small dams on summer stream temperatures in a protected area in southern Quebec, Canada. We assessed the effect of small surface-release dams on four attributes of the thermal regimes (magnitude, frequency and duration of warm events, and rate of change) of streams by comparing water temperature measured in the main tributary upstream and in the main outlet down-stream of the reservoir. We also compared the thermal effects of reservoirs to those of natural lakes of similar size. Using a generalized additive model, we identified key determinants of stream temperature to assess the influence of reservoir and natural lake characteristics on the thermal regime of streams. In August 2020, we observed an average warming of 3.7 degrees C downstream of reservoirs regulated by small dams compared to conditions upstream of the reser-voir. During this period, the warming effect of reservoirs was not significantly different from the warming effect of natural lakes (3.4 degrees C). In addition to the drainage area, distance to an upstream water body, and the proportion of the watershed occupied by water bodies were the primary determinants of stream temperature in August, demonstrat-ing the importance of nearby water bodies on stream thermal regimes. Given their warming effect, small waterbodies may limit the available habitat for species that are sensitive to warm temperatures. As the construction of small dams is accelerating at the global scale, a clear understanding of the cumulative effects of small lakes and reservoirs on stream temperature is required to ensure the sound management of aquatic ecosystems.					; Turgeon, Katrine/K-9980-2019; Maheu, Audrey/N-6483-2019; St-Hilaire, André/W-7120-2019; Senecal, Jean-Francois/J-3714-2019	Senecal, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4937-8552; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 15	2023	869								161445	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161445		JAN 2023						36634771					WOS:000964878600001

Development of a Subcloud Layer over the Sea during a Cold Air Invasion	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												Evaporation and vertical moisture and heat transfer from the underlying surface are the basis of cloud formation. The situation when the coming relatively cold stably stratified air moves over a warm ocean is a typical problem in the development of a turbulent convective layer. The problem of cloud formation is also of scientific and practical interest. This paper considers the problems of the formation of a turbulent convective layer over a warmer ocean and the vertical distribution of relative humidity. The results of the theoretical model are compared with the data of observations of the development of the turbulent convective layer at low latitudes (in the Indian Ocean) and at higher latitudes (in autumn over Lake Michigan). Approximate equations describe well the dynamics of temperature and humidity of the layer as a function of the difference between the temperatures of the approaching and near-surface air layers. The theoretical results are compared with the data on measurements of the condensation heights obtained at the Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport. Some discrepancy between them is due to the unsteadiness measurement and the approximations adopted in the theoretical model.

Increasing nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the mesocosms represented different trophic states, from mesotrophic to hypertrophic. In 1998, the mesocosms were in a turbid state with a high biomass of phytoplankton, whereas in 1999, macrophytes proliferated and a clear-water state prevailed. The bacterial communities in the mesocosms also developed differently, as shown by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of partial 16S rRNA gene fragments and by nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. In 1998, nutrient treatments affected the diversity and clustering of bacterial communities strongly, but in 1999, the bacterial communities were less diversified and not clearly affected by treatments. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that bacterioplankton communities in the mesocosms were influenced by environmental physicochemical variables linked to the increasing level of eutrophication. Nitrogen concentration correlated directly with the bacterioplankton composition. In addition, the high nutrient levels had indirect effects through changes in the biomass and composition of phyto- and zooplankton. Sequencing analysis showed that the dominant bacterial divisions remained the same, but the dominant phylotypes changed during the 2-year period. The occurrence of Verrucomicrobia correlated with more eutrophic conditions, whereas the occurrence of Actinobacteria correlated with less eutrophic conditions.

Stomach contents were examined among habitat types (i.e., main channel, main-channel border, and shoreline habitats) and depth (surface, middle, and bottom). Diet of larval bluegill sunfish was dominated by Chironomidae, temporally and spatially. Chironomidae dominated larval longear sunfish diet in main channel and main-channel border collections from all three depths. However, along the shoreline, larval longear sunfish diet was dominated by Cladocera.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1998	13	2					221	228		10.1080/02705060.1998.9663610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1998.9663610													WOS:000074003400009

The taxonomic composition and size fractions of phytoplankton, as well as number and biomass of phyto-, zoo- and bacterioplankton, were investigated. Despite the removal of all fish before the experiment and extensive stocking with predatory fish, attempts to biomanipulate a top-down control of phytoplankton in the Maltanski Reservoir were not successful except for the first season. Macrozooplankton filtration (including cladocerans and calanoids) was found to control the development of small organisms only, such as pico-, nano- and bacterioplankton. Microplankton were also under the influence of filter feeders, but these were not effectively eliminated. Zooplankton grazing stimulated the development of large phytoplanktonic organisms both by providing intermediate disturbances for their growth and by supplying them with nutrients released from grazed small-size organisms. A similar influence on micro- and nanophytoplankton was exerted by microzooplankton (including rotifers and nauplii). The presence of picophytoplankton and bacterioplankton, however, was positively correlated with microzooplankton number.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Kozak, Anna/0000-0001-7448-0498; 													0142-7873					JAN	2004	26	1					37	48		10.1093/plankt/fbh006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbh006													WOS:000187988400005
J	Ducklow, HW				Ducklow, HW			The bacterial component of the oceanic euphotic zone	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Bacteria in the open sea remote from land are sustained strictly on local sources of organic production which should make understanding their nutrition and growth regulation easier than in nearshore systems, estuaries and lakes. Until now, a paucity of data from geographically isolated oceanic sites prevented ready :interpretation. In the past decade investigation of bacterial properties in oceanic systems has increased rapidly, stimulated in part by large oceanographic programs like the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study. Here I review comprehensive investigations of bacterial biomass and production dynamics in the subarctic north Atlantic and north Pacific, oligotrophic gyres in both oceans, upwelling provinces in the equatorial Pacific and northwest Arabian Sea, and in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Euphotic zone bacterial stocks are remarkably similar across all except the last regime, averaging about 1 g C m(-2). Production and growth rates vary more widely, suggesting independent regulation of biomass and production. The seasonal to annual mean ratio of bacterial to primary production is usually below 20%.

Despite the cold nutrient-poor water and the short ice-free summer, the mosses form dense stands on the lake bottom down to great depths. The environmental conditions suggest that moss growth and decomposition are extremely slow, but logistical and methodological difficulties have so far precluded direct measurements of the processes. Here. we use temporal changes in the size and density of leaves along the axis of moss shoots collected from different depths in Char Lake and North Lake in the Canadian High Arctic to reconstruct the annual growth and decomposition of the mosses during the past 10-17 years. Our results show low but remarkably constant annual elongation rates (about 10 mm shoot(-1)) in the long-lived shoots that carry green leaves for several years and decompose slowly. Cold temperatures and low nutrient supply in combination with the short Arctic growing season can account for the low growth rate, the low decomposition rates, and the unprecedented longevity of these moss communities relative to other submerged macrophytes.

Chronogaster Cobb, 1913, Plectus Bastian, 1865 and Prismatolaimus de Man, 1880, two of which are new to science are described from a hot spring, Rivers Abbay and Gelda and Lake Tana, Ethiopia. Chronogaster ethiopica n. sp., in its possession of a ventral mucro, comes close to a number of species but differs from all hitherto known species in a combination of characteristics: its possession of crystalloid bodies, vacuolated lateral glandular bodies, horse-shoe-shaped amphids and spineless tail terminus, and its lack of longitudinal lateral lines. C. getachewi n. sp. is a unique species in the genus in having more than 100 vacuolated lateral glandular bodies and a dorsal mucro that emerges from the tail terminus about 1.5 mu m from the tail tip. Detailed descriptions of C. multispinatoides Heyns & Coomans, 1984, Plectus (Plectus) galapagensis De Ley & Coomans, 1994, and Prismatolaimus matoni Mulk & Coomans, 1979 are given. The most important characteristics in the specific identifications of the genus Chronogaster are discussed. These most important characteristics of the seventeen species described after the first review of the genus by Heyns & Coomans (1980) are reviewed in the form of tables and illustrations. Additional information on the morphology of the genus generated after the first review is particularly dealt with. In addition, SEM pictures of C. getachewi n. sp., C. multispinatoides, P.

G.; Opfergelt, Sophie			Seasonal Changes in Hydrology and Permafrost Degradation Control Mineral Element-Bound DOC Transport From Permafrost Soils to Streams	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Mineral elements bind to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in permafrost soils, and this may contribute to the stabilization or the degradation of organic carbon along the soil to river continuum. Permafrost thaw enlarges the pool of soil constituents available for soil to river transfer. The unknown is how changes in hydrology upon permafrost degradation affect the connection between soil-derived mineral element-bound DOC and headwater streams. Here, we study Al, Fe, Ca, and DOC concentrations in water from a headwater stream at Eight Mile Lake, Alaska, USA (colloidal [0.22 mu m-1 kDa] and truly dissolved [<1 kDa] fractions) and in soil pore waters sampled across a gradient of permafrost degradation at the same location. We target the peak flow to base flow transition to show that there is a narrow window of mineral element-bound DOC colloid transport from soils to streams. We show that during spring thaw and maximum thaw there is an enhanced lateral transfer of mineral element-bound DOC colloids in extensively degraded sites compared to minimally degraded sites. This is explained by a more rapid response of hydrology at peak flow to base flow transition at degraded sites. Our results suggest that ongoing permafrost degradation and the associated response of soils to changing hydrology can be detected by targeting the composition and size of mineral element-DOC associations in soil waters and headwater streams during peak flow-baseflow transitions.

One sediment core was collected from Dali Lake in north EASM margin of China and high-resolution multi-proxies are analyzed. The constant rate of supply (CRS) model based on Cs-137 and Pb-210 contents is established and provides a detail history of EASM variability and environmental changes over past similar to 168 years. The period from similar to 1847 to 1900 AD was characterized by the steady values of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC) and C/N and decrease in C-13(org) values reflected slightly enhanced EASM. The period between similar to 1901 to 1944 AD, C-13(org) values indicated EASM first decrease and then increase. The gradually increased TN, TP and TOC values and the decreased C/N ratios indicated the shrink of the lake area caused by the higher evaporation and autochthonous OM increased. From similar to 1945 to 2015 AD, the increased values in TN, TP and TOC may be mainly caused by the shrink of the lake area and the enhanced human activities, and C-13(org) values suggested a fluctuant EASM in this period. Mercury (Hg) element in Dali Lake sediments gradually increased since 1847 AD while it was constant in the interval of similar to 1944-1959 AD and then kept increasing, which may be caused by the increased Hg content in atmosphere from Europe and other industrial area. The EASM variability over past similar to 168 years showed the trends were similar to EASM records in other regions of China. Furthermore, our findings indicated that the variability of the EASM was forced by changes in oceanic-atmospheric circulation interaction.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				MAR	2019	46	2					172	181		10.1134/S0097807819020180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807819020180													WOS:000468625300004
J	Gilbert, R; Desloges, JR; Clague, JJ				Gilbert, R; Desloges, JR; Clague, JJ			The glacilacustrine sedimentary environment of Bowser Lake in the northern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Bowser Lake, a fiord lake in the northern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, contains a thick Holocene fill consisting mainly of silt and clay varves. These sediments were carried into the lake by proglacial Bowser River which drains a high-energy, heavily glacierized basin. Sedimentation in the lake is controlled by seasonal snow and ice melt, by autumn rainstorms, and by rare, but very large jokulhlaups from glacier-dammed lakes in the upper Bowser River basin which complicate environmental inferences from the sedimentary record. Sediment is dispersed through the deep western part of the lake by energetic turbidity currents. The turbidity currents apparently do not overtop a sill that separates the western basin from much shallower areas to the east. Large amounts of silt and clay are deposited from suspension in the eastern part of the lake, but sediment accumulation rates there are much lower than to the west. Several strong acoustic reflectors punctuate the varved fill in the western basin; these may be thick or relatively coarse beds deposited during jokulhlaups or exceptionally large storms. The contemporary sediment yield to Bowser Lake, estimated from sediments in the lake, is about 360 t km(-2) a(-1). This is a relatively high value, but it is less than yields in some other, similar montane basins with extensive snow and ice cover. The most likely explanation for the difference is that large amounts of sediment have been, and continue to be, stored on the Bowser delta and in small proglacial lakes.

J	Barrett, CM; Kelly, R; Higuera, PE; Hu, FS				Barrett, Carolyn M.; Kelly, Ryan; Higuera, Philip E.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Climatic and land cover influences on the spatiotemporal dynamics of Holocene boreal fire regimes	ECOLOGY												Although recent climatic warming has markedly increased fire activity in many biomes, this trend is spatially heterogeneous. Understanding the patterns and controls of this heterogeneity is important for anticipating future fire regime shifts at regional scales and for developing land management policies. To assess climatic and land cover controls on boreal forest fire regimes, we conducted macroscopic-charcoal analysis of sediment cores and GIS analysis of landscape variation in south-central Alaska, USA. Results reveal that fire occurrence was highly variable both spatially and temporally over the past seven millennia. At two of four sites, the lack of distinct charcoal peaks throughout much of this period suggests the absence of large local fires, attributed to abundant water bodies in the surrounding landscape that have likely functioned as firebreaks to limit fire spread. In contrast, distinct charcoal peaks suggest numerous local fires at the other two sites where water bodies are less abundant. In periods of the records where robust charcoal peaks allow identification of local-fire events over the past 7000 years, mean fire return intervals varied widely with a range of 138-453 years. Furthermore, the temporal trajectories of local-fire frequency differed greatly among sites and were statistically independent. Inferred biomass burning and mean summer temperature in the region were not significantly correlated prior to 3000 years ago but became positively related subsequently with varying correlation strengths. Climatic variability associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, along with the expansion of flammable Picea mariana forests, probably have heightened the sensitivity of forest burning to summer temperature variations over the past three millennia. These results elucidate the patterns and controls of boreal fire regime dynamics over a broad range of spatiotemporal scales, and they imply that anthropogenic climatic warming and associated land cover changes, in particular lake drying, will interact to affect boreal forest burning over the coming decades.

Plectolyngbya hodgsonii: a novel filamentous cyanobacterium from Antarctic lakes	POLAR BIOLOGY												A special cluster of filamentous, false-branched cyanobacteria, isolated from littoral mat samples in coastal lakes of the Larsemann Hills region (coll. by D. Hodgson) was studied by a polyphasic approach. This morphotype has several characters corresponding to the traditional genera Leptolyngbya (morphology of trichomes), Pseudo-phormidium (type of false branching) or Schizothrix (occasional multiple arrangement of trichomes in the sheaths). However, this cluster of strains is distinctly isolated according to its phylogenetic position (based on 16S rRNA gene sequences), and thus, a separate generic classification its justified. The cytomorphology of this generic entity is also characteristic. Therefore, a new genus (Plectolyngbya with the type species P. hodgsonii) was described. The same cyanobacterial morphotype was found in the littoral zone of the partially frozen inland Monolith Lake in the northern, deglaciated area of James Ross Island, in the NW part of the Weddell Sea. Plectolyngbya hodgsonii occurs evidently in more Antarctic lakes of the continental type, under very particular conditions (littoral with average temperature below 3 C during the Antarctic summer season, with periodical drying and freezing for more than 8 months in a year). The valid definition, phenotype documentation and ultrastructural characters of this cyanobacterium are presented in this article. Morphologically (and possibly genetically) similar types are common in other habitats in various regions and represent probably different species.					; Elster, Josef/B-1031-2008; Komarek, Jiri/H-1597-2014; Wilmotte, Annick/H-1686-2011	Elster, Josef/0000-0002-4535-5636; Wilmotte, Annick/0000-0003-3546-3489; 													0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	2011	34	2					181	191		10.1007/s00300-010-0868-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-010-0868-y													WOS:000287904600003

Air-sea gaseous exchange of PCB at the Venice lagoon (Italy)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Water bodies are important storage media for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and this function is increased in coastal regions because their inputs are higher than those to the open sea. The air-water interface is extensively involved with the global cycling of PCBs because it is the place where they accumulate due to depositional processes and where they may be emitted by gaseous exchange. In this work the parallel collection of air, microlayer and sub-superficial water samples was performed in July 2005 at a site in the Venice lagoon to evaluate the summer gaseous flux of PCBs. The total concentration of PCBs (sum of 118 congeners) in air varies from 87 to 273 pg m(-3), whereas in the operationally defined dissolved phase of microlayer and sub-superficial water samples it varies from 159 to 391 pg L-1. No significant enrichment of dissolved PCB into the microlayer has been observed, although a preferential accumulation of most hydrophobic congeners occurs. Due to this behaviour, we believe that the modified two-layer model was the most suitable approach for the evaluation of the flux at the air-sea interface, because it takes into account the influence of the microlayer. From its application it appears that PCB volatilize from the lagoon waters with a net flux varying from 58 to 195 ng M-2 d(-1) (uncertainty: +/- 50-64%) due to the strong influence of wind speed. This flux is greater than those reported in the literature for the atmospheric deposition and rivers input and reveals that PCB are actively emitted from the Venice lagoon in summer months.

Effects of stocking, environment, and fish community on Walleye recruitment in eastern South Dakota natural lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Recruitment of Walleye Sander vitreus has experienced declines across the upper Midwest, but there remains no consensus among managers about the factors influencing recruitment. The South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks manages Walleye fisheries in eastern South Dakota and commonly relies on stockings to maintain populations with limited natural recruitment. Using over 20 years of sampling and stocking data, we evaluated the importance of various abiotic and biotic factors on Walleye recruitment, indexed as age-2 catch per gill net (CPGN).Methods We compared 31 Bayesian mixed-effects hurdle models using an approximated leave-one-out cross validation to assess combinations of stocked products (fry, small fingerling, large fingerling, and not stocked), water body surface area, cohort-year environmental variables (growing degree-days, winter severity, and spring precipitation), and cohort-year stock-length centrarchid (Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus and Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus) catch per frame net (CPFN) and Northern Pike Esox lucius CPGN on age-2 Walleye CPGN.Results Stocking product and centrarchid CPFN were factors incorporated in all four top models. Age-2 Walleye CPGN more than doubled following fry, small fingerling, or large fingerling stockings compared with nonstocked years and declined as centrarchid CPFN increased. Age-2 Walleye CPGN increased with lake surface area and slightly decreased with Northern Pike CPGN. The probability that age-2 Walleye CPGN equaled zero increased with higher centrarchid CPFN and decreased with water body surface area for fry and nonstocked years and was low following fingerling stockings. However, these models explained little variation in our data, and the Bayesian R2 values for the four top models were <= 0.303. The poor model fit likely indicates that a large suite of factors and their interactions have a considerable influence on Walleye recruitment.Conclusions Our models suggest that stocking Walleye in eastern South Dakota is important for increasing relative abundance of age-2 Walleye, high centrarchid and Northern Pike abundances may limit Walleye recruitment, and recruitment success may increase with water body size. Walleye recruitment to age 2 in eastern South Dakota lakes is improved by stocking, is negatively affected by centrarchid and Northern Pike relative abundances, and increases with surface area. However, the models used in analysis generally explained little variability in age-2 Walleye gill-net catch.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2025	45	5					813	824		10.1093/najfmt/vqaf056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqaf056		JUL 2025											WOS:001533468900001

However, little is known about its occurrence and potential in eutrophic freshwater habitats. This study investigated the diazotrophic diversity and seasonal variation of nitrogenase activity (NA) in the sediments of a cyanobacterial bloom-occurring bay of a freshwater lake. Sequencing analysis of the nifH gene revealed that diazotrophs in Clusters I and III constituted the dominant components of the diazotrophic community in Meiliang Bay. Both nifH and 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the microbes in sediments have different community structures during the winter than during other seasons. The concentrations of dissolved sulfide, sulfate, and nitrate in pore water were significantly correlated with NA in sediments; however, the Mantel test indicated that dissolved sulfide had a more significant effect on the structure of the diazotrophic community than did other environmental factors. Laboratory culture experiments under different redox conditions further confirmed the inhibitory effect of dissolved sulfide on BNF in sediments. This study revealed that the BNF in sediments of Meiliang Bay was closely linked to variations in dissolved sulfide concentration, which has broadened our understanding of BNF in freshwater lakes.

We identified a total of 6 sea ice events that occurred in the sea areas to the south of 35 degrees N. These extreme events occurred in the winters of AD 821/822, 903/904, 1453/1454, 1493/1494, 1654/1655 and 1670/1671. According to the historical records, the southern limit of sea ice in the Chinese marginal seas should be in Hangzhou Bay (30-31 degrees N), and most probably near Haiyan County in Zhejiang Province (30.5 degrees N). The sea ice events of 1453/1454 and 1654/1655 were synchronous with the freezing events of Taihu Lake, and the sea ice event of 1670/1671 was synchronous with the freezing event of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. However, none of the sea ice events was synchronous with the abnormally early freezing dates of Suwa Lake in Japan or the extreme freezing events of Venice Lagoon in Italy. Although all of the sea ice events occurred in a cold climate on a 30 yr timescale, they were not synchronous with the extreme cold winters of other sites in the northern hemisphere. However, the sea ice event of 1453/1454 may have been related to the ca. 1453 Kuwae eruption. Our findings increase our understanding of both regional environmental change in the Chinese marginal seas and the regional nature of global climate change.

New climate proxies presented here from the BB3-I core, whose chronology was established in a recent publication focusing on its paleomagnetic record, consist of sediment grain-size, C-org/N, ostracode faunal counts, lipid molecular stratigraphy, and palynology. They build on previously publised proxies from this basin based on environmental magnetism and supporting lithological features found in outcrop and core. Results from granulometry, geochemical analysis and the presence of the ostracode Cytherissa lacustris consistently demonstrate the correspondence of low lake conditions and colder water temperatures during Dansgaard-Oeschger stadials during a time interval including the low magnetic intensity feature of the Mono Lake Excursion, a paleomagnetic event found both in the lake core of this study and the composite Greenland ice core record between Interstadials #7 and #6. Pollen data also support this finding, suggesting colder and drier continental montane woodland conditions during stadials versus warmer and wetter semi-arid woodland conditions during interstadials. This is further supported with lipid molecular stratigraphy, indicating a consistent tendency toward terrestrial-sourced vegetation, reflecting increased stream discharge into deeper lakes during interstadials versus dominance of aquatic vegetation during low-discharge, low lake stadials. These results suggesting wet interstadials confirm those of earlier studies at Summer Lake and for other lake records in the Great Basin for millennial-scale climate change during MIS 3 age.

Derek			Mortality, Dispersal, and Habitat Use of Stocked Juvenile Muskellunge in Two Western North Carolina Rivers	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Muskellunge Esox masquinongy is a highly sought-after sport fish that is native to the Tennessee River drainage of western North Carolina. After the extirpation of Muskellunge from North Carolina in the 1950s, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission began a stocking program to re-establish the species and produce viable Muskellunge fisheries in North Carolina. Although stocking efforts have created a Muskellunge fishery in, for example, the French Broad River (where the species was native), there is little evidence of success in North Carolina sections of the New River (where the species was not native). Possible mechanisms inhibiting stocking success are unclear because there is relatively little information available on the juvenile life stage of the Muskellunge, especially in the southern portion of its distribution. We addressed the perceived differences in recruitment between the two fisheries by using telemetry to investigate dispersal, mortality, and habitat use by stocked juvenile Muskellunge. Fifty hatchery-reared, age-0 Muskellunge (282-307 mm TL) were tagged prior to stocking in the New River (fall 2013) and French Broad River (fall 2014). Three months after stocking, known survival of tagged fish was 4% in the New River and 29% in the French Broad River; the survival probability after 3 months was estimated at 9% (range = 4-17%) in the New River and 37% (range = 25-56%) in the French Broad River. Extended survival in the French Broad River was 14% at 252 d poststocking. High dispersal was observed, with maximum individual dispersal of 67.4 km in the New River and 55.5 km in the French Broad River. Habitat suitability analyses indicated that juvenile Muskellunge in the FBR selected shallow nearshore areas with low water velocity, fine substrate, and substantial cover in the form of woody debris and overhanging vegetation. Information on the survival and behavior of stocked Muskellunge can facilitate efforts to successfully manage these fisheries.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	1					108	121		10.1080/02755947.2016.1245222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1245222													WOS:000394648700012

Proxies included % total organic matter, % total carbonate, magnetic susceptibility, C/N ratios, % organic carbon, % total nitrogen, % biogenic silica and delta(18)O and delta(13)C of carbonate, as well as delta(13)C and delta(15)N of bulk organic matter. There is a marked shift in most proxies at similar to 9.4 ka which defines the start of Holocene warmth in this region. Prior to this, the area was influenced by the post-Younger Dryas cold/wet interval, controlled by a southward displacement of the polar front jet stream, when many proxies were at their minimum. The Hypsithermal interval (similar to 9.4 - 5.3 ka) was the warmest and wettest of the Holocene due to a long- term increase in summer insolation. The Hypsithermal, however, was interrupted by two cold climates; the 8.2 ka event (similar to 8.4 - 8.0 ka) and the Nipissing Rise (similar to 6.8 - 5.0 ka), both of which are linked to a reduction in thermohaline circulation and northward oceanic heat transport. The Neoglacial interval (similar to 5.3 ka to similar to 1850 AD), driven by a long- term decrease in summer insolation, was cooler and dryer, but more stable, than the Hypsithermal. The short Historic interval (post similar to 1850 AD) was characterized by some of the largest amplitude and most abrupt anomalies of the past 10,000 years, due to intense anthropogenic activity, when a number of proxies reached unprecedented values.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012	Anderson, William/0000-0003-0301-8938; Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2005	33	3					371	391		10.1007/s10933-004-7634-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-004-7634-5													WOS:000227704300009

Recent research on taliks has been driven largely by the potential for release of greenhouse gases as taliks expand, and engineering challenges associated with thawing permafrost. Observations of talik configuration and development have been assisted by advances in geophysical techniques that complement mechanical and thermal measurements. Suprapermafrost taliks have been observed in a range of settings associated with disturbance from wildfire and infrastructure. These features are included in a revised talik classification scheme presented in this paper. Observations of methane release have renewed interest in lake talik initiation and development, resulting in substantial efforts to model thaw lake expansion. Hotspots of methane release have also been identified at saline springs. Recent simulations indicate that groundwater flow can significantly accelerate talik expansion and that incorporating heat advection may be required for accurate transient simulations. Ongoing global warming is expected to exacerbate the effects of surface disturbances on talik development and limit the ability of permafrost to recover in marginal permafrost areas.

Snowcover and melt characteristics of upland/lowland terrain: Polar Bear Pass, Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												The seasonal snowcover and snowmelt (2008-2010) of an extensive low-gradient wetland at Polar Bear Pass, Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada (75 degrees 40' N, 98 degrees 30' W) was examined. This wildlife sanctuary is characterized by two large lakes and numerous tundra ponds, and is bordered by rolling hills with incised hillslope stream valleys. In arctic environments snow remains one of the most important sources of water for wetlands. End-of-winter snowcover measurements (snow depth, density, water equivalent) together with direct and modeled estimates of snowmelt provided an assessment of the seasonal snowcover regime of representative terrain types comprising upland (plateau, stream valley, late-lying snowbed) and lowland landscapes (wet meadow, ponds, lakes). In all three seasons, deep and persistent snowpacks occurred in sheltered areas (stream valleys) and in the lee of slopes adjacent to the wetland. Exposed areas yielded shallow snowpacks (e.g. plateau, pond) and they melted out rapidly in response to favorable weather conditions. Overall, the basin snowcover and melt progression was dominated by accumulation and melt occurring in upland areas. We surmise the sustainability of this low-gradient wetland is dependent on snowmelt contributions from upland sites.																			1998-9563	2224-7955					2013	44	1					2	20		10.2166/nh.2012.083	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2012.083													WOS:000312498000002

Cladophora (Chlorophyta) spp. harbor human bacterial pathogens in nearshore water of Lake Michigan	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Cladophora glomerata, a macrophytic green alga, is commonly found in the Great Lakes, and significant accumulations occur along shorelines during the summer months. Recently, Cladophora has been shown to harbor high densities of the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and enterococci. Cladophora may also harbor human pathogens; however, until now, no studies to address this question have been performed. In the present study, we determined whether attached Cladophora, obtained from the Lake Michigan and Burns Ditch (Little Calumet River, Indiana) sides of a breakwater during the summers of 2004 and 2005, harbored the bacterial pathogens Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. The presence of potential pathogens and numbers of organisms were determined by using cultural methods and by using conventional PCR, most-probable-number PCR (MPN-PCR), and quantitative PCR (QPCR) performed with genus- and toxin-specific primers and probes. While Shigella and STEC were detected in 100% and 25%, respectively, of the algal samples obtained near Burns Ditch in 2004, the same pathogens were not detected in samples collected in 2005. MPN-PCR and QPCR allowed enumeration of Salmonella in 40 to 80% of the ditch- and lakeside samples, respectively, and the densities were up to 1.6 X 10(3) cells per g Cladophora. Similarly, these PCR methods allowed enumeration of up to 5.4 X 10(2) Campylabacter cells/g Cladophora in 60 to 100% of take- and ditchside samples. The Campylobacter densities were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the lakeside Cladophora samples than in the ditchside Cladophora samples. DNA fingerprint analyses indicated that genotypically identical Salmonella isolates were associated with geographically and temporally distinct Cladophora samples. However, Campylobacter isolates were genetically diverse. Since animal hosts are thought to be the primary habitat for Campylobacter and Salmonella species, our results suggest that Cladophora is a likely secondary habitat for pathogenic bacteria in Lake Michigan and that the association of these bacteria with Cladophora warrants additional studies to assess the potential health impact on beach users.					; Sadowsky, Michael/J-2507-2016; Ishii, Satoshi/C-7000-2012	Byappanahalli, Muruleedhara/0000-0001-5376-597X; Sadowsky, Michael/0000-0001-8779-2781; Shively, Dawn/0000-0002-6119-924X													0099-2240					JUL	2006	72	7					4545	4553		10.1128/AEM.00131-06	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00131-06								16820442					WOS:000238961000006

Samples were collected from 3 areas: the profundal zone, a shallow littoral zone dominated by Paspalum fluitans and the rush Scirpus americanus and a deep littoral zone dominated by dense stands of floating and emergent macrophytes. The profundal zone had a limited fauna, dominated by the chironomid Coelotanypus tricolor. Littoral areas had a more diverse macroinvertebrate fauna, with the amphipod genus Crangonyx (C. gracilis and C. serratus) dominant. Densities were generally highest in the shallow littoral sediments, lower among the shallow littoral macrophytes and still lower in the deep littoral zone. Profundal macroinvertebrate densities exhibited little seasonal variation and were considerably lower (< 1000 m-2) than densities in the littoral zone. Marked seasonal variation in littoral macroinvertebrate densities were associated with fluctuations in the quantity and quality of food resources and with a drop in water level during the summer dry season.																			0003-9136						1981	92	3					306	320																WOS:A1981MN01800003

The sequences were derived from monoclonal strains isolated from four volcanic high-altitude athalassohaline lakes in Mexico, five glacial ultraoligotrophic North Patagonian lakes and six Italian lakes of glacial, volcanic and morenic origin. The new sequences fall into a number of both novel and previously described clades within the phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA gene. The new cluster of Lake Nahuel Huapi (North Patagonia) forms a sister clade to the subalpine cluster II and the marine Synechococcus subcluster 5.2. Our finding of the novel clade of halotolerants' close to the marine subcluster 5.3 (Synechococcus RCC307) constitutes an important demonstration that euryhaline and marine strains affiliate closely.

The hatchery spawners were released in autumn 1989 into the spawning localities of two wild trout stocks in River Oyreselv, Norway The F-1 generation was sampled and genotyped at the 0+, 1+, and 2+ stages. Juveniles carrying the genetic markers were found in both localities, proving that the introduced spawners had spawned among themselves and with the wild stocks. The genetic contribution from the hatchery fish was estimated at 19.2 and 16.3% at the 0+ stage in the two wild stocks. Estimates of survival rates of 0+ trout revealed that survival was nearly three times higher in wild trout than in hybrids of wild and introduced trout, possibly because of a difference between introduced and wild stocks in size of eggs and alevins. The frequency of the marker alleles in the F-1 generation declined during the 2-year observation period.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1996	53	9					2027	2035																WOS:A1996WE25900010

The project was organised within the framework of the Italian Antarctic Program (Programma Nationale di Richerche in Antartide, PNRA). The search was carried out in the vicinity of Frontier Mountain (North Victoria Land) and 256 meteorite fragments were discovered, most of which were wind-blown across the blue-ice field to the NE of Frontier Mountain and finally caught in an ice depression about 5 km to the N. The larger meteorites which remained on the ice surface from which they were uncovered may have been transported down to the mountain edge where they have subsequently been destroyed or covered in debris. A search for meteorites at neighbouring Sequence Hills, where similar glaciological conditions as at Frontier Mountain exist, proved unsuccessful. At this location the surface of the blue ice in the valleys with suspected meteorite concentrations was covered by meltwater lakes.

Climate variability in the Upper Jordan Valley around 0.78 Ma, inferences from time-series stable isotopes of Viviparidae, supported by mollusc and plant palaeoecology	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Early-Middle Pleistocene lacustrine sediments at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov (GBY) in the Upper Jordan Valley span ca. 100 Ka across the Matuyama-Brunhes Boundary (MBB) at 780 Ka and oxygen isotope stages (OISs) 20 to 18, provide a continuous record of their sedimentary history and prevailing climate. The lacustrine environment is investigated using ecological and stable isotope characteristics of gastropods belonging to the family Viviparidae supplemented by other molluscan and floral indicators. The sedimentary framework of the 34 in thick sequence is bounded by channel conglomerates at its base and top, and consists of six sedimentary cycles Each one starts with shore sediments (coquina and sand) and ends with deeper water sediments (black mud or gray mud) Time series of delta O-18 and delta C-13 values were determined in individual shells belonging to two sympatric genera of viviparid gastropods: Viviparus apameae gahleae and Bellamya sp found in the sedimentary cycles 2 through 5. The total overall range of delta O-18 in the time series of all the shells is from -10 5 parts per thousand to -5 2 parts per thousand (VPDB), and the delta C-13 from -9.2 parts per thousand to -4 8 parts per thousand (VPDB). The delta C-13 values of shells recovered from black mud are lower than those from the other sediment types suggesting a higher proportion of carbon of organic origin. The delta C-18 values show only a weak relation with sediment type. The time series of the individual shells indicate a relative constancy in the water delta C-18 and temperature whilst the variation in delta C-13 could be related to the annual productivity cycle (growth and decay of aquatic plants) of the lake. The delta C-13 patterns in the time series and winter rings indicate that the rate of growth of the individual snails was ca. 15-30 mm/year. The isotopic characteristics of the Viviparid shells from these beds indicate diverse sedimentary environments and suggest that above the MBB (cycles 2-5) the GBY lake received constant and isotopically consistent water inflow. Our integrated data, isotopic and ecological of molluscs. and ecological of plants. indicates that the geophysical-magnetic phenomenon of MBB coincides with an environmental change from a relatively cold dry climate towards a warmer temperate subtropical climate in this region. This change coincides with the occurrence of hominin artifacts, which were found mainly in layers of the sedimentary cycles 3-5. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Shankman, D; Liang, QL				Shankman, D; Liang, QL			Landscape changes and increasing flood frequency in China's Poyang Lake region	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												Jiangxi Province in southeastern China contains Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. Poyang Lake and the lower sections of the major Jiangxi rivers flowing into the lake often flood during the early summer months. Floodwater can be several meters above the surrounding lowlands during the most severe flood events. Levees at the margins of Poyang Lake and along the Jiangxi rivers provide flood protection for about 10 million people. The number of severe floods in this region has increased rapidly during the past few decades, resulting in catastrophic levee failures. The three factors likely responsible for the increasing frequency of severe floods are (1) land reclamation and levee construction and (2) lake sedimentation, both of which reduce lake volume, and (3) increasing Changjiang water level, which slows Poyang Lake drainage.																			0033-0124					NOV	2003	55	4					434	445		10.1111/0033-0124.5504003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0033-0124.5504003													WOS:000186231200003

Altogether 312 water samples were analyzed. The fen/bog limit, as determined in the field with vascular plant and moss indicators, was seldom clearly reflected in the concentrations of individual chemical elements, but clearer differentiation was obtained when the chemical parameters were combined. The means of the total material of ombrotrophic and poor minerotrophic mire waters differed significantly with respect to 14 chemical or biological parameters (particulary pH, Ca, Mg, Fe). The algal flora showed good correspondence with the water chemistry of the different hollow types. The average algal growth potential (AGP) recorded with Ankistrodesmus falcatus (Corda) Ralfs, Selenastrum capricornutum Printz. [and Oocystis solitaria] was clearly higher in bog water than in fen water. In the former AGP was near to that reported for the most oligotrophic Finnish lakes and in the latter it was near to that of mesotrophic lakes. The growth of Ankistrodesmus correlated best with the Cl concentration of the water.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1978	15	1					55	72																WOS:A1978EX63000008

The water from Nagase river is the cause of acid water in this lake. Deep lakes have a possibility of occurring internal seiche, which is very important in terms of not only hydraulics but also water quality, because it contributes to the water purification and mixture. Field observation was carried out in autumn season when the thermocline breaks down gradually. From the result of water temperature observation, the existence of internal seiche was confirmed. The wave height and difference of water temperature attain to about 15m and 8 degree, respectively and internal seiche continued about 6 days. After this event the thermocline was disappeared. It thus suggests that the internal seiche mixed the lake water all over the depth. To examine three dimensional interface response to wind stress, two layer model using a constant depth was applied. The nonlinear term and the interface stress are neglected to calculate this model. The input external force is only wind stress, which is obtained at AMeDAS (Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System, Japan Meteorological Agency) station located about 3km north from Lake Inawashiro. From the result of calculation, computation and observation shows fairly good agreement, and the existence of internal Kelvin wave was confirmed in Lake Inawashiro. However there are some differences between observed and calculated. One of the reasons about it, the difference of actual wind and AMcDAS data is regarded.																									2001							578	583																WOS:000175456900083

Understanding the mechanisms of P release from sediments should help to restore water quality. This study used the diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) technique to investigate the seasonal variation in the lability, remobilization mechanisms, and release characteristics of sediment P in the uncontaminated Xizhi River and the severely contaminated Danshui River, South China. P accumulation in sediments contributed to higher DGT-labile P concentrations in contaminated reaches, and the highest labile P concentrations were generally observed in summer season at each site. The significant positive relationships (p < 0.05) between labile Fe and P confirmed the Fe-P coupling release mechanism in uncontaminated sediments. Stronger relationships between labile Mn and Pat contaminated sites indicated that Mn oxides played an important role in P remobilization. However, sulfate reduction associated with microbial activities (crucial genera: Desulfobulbus, Desulfomicrobium and Desulforhabdus) was considered to decouple the Fe & Mn-P cycling relationship, promoting P release at contaminated sites. The effluxes of sediment P were much higher in the Danshui River (mean 0.132 mg cm(-2).d(-1)) than in the Xizhi River (mean 0.038 mg cm(-2).d(-1)). And hot season led to growth in P effluxes that was much greater in contaminated river. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Denitrification in aquatic environments:: A cross-system analysis	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												A meta-analysis was conducted on 136 data sets of denitrification rates (DR) recorded both during the period of highest water temperature and monthly in five types of aquatic ecosystems: oceans, coastal environments, estuaries, lakes and rivers. There was a gradual increase of DR from the ocean to rivers and lakes at both scales, with the rivers showing the highest DR variability. Denitrification peaked during summertime and showed highest seasonal variability in lakes and rivers. High concentrations of nitrate and interstitially-dissolved organic carbon as well as low oxygen concentration in the overlying water enhanced DR both during summer and at a seasonal scale whereas total phosphorus did at the seasonal scale only. There was a positive linear relationship between overlying nitrate and DR over the range of 1-970 mu mol NO3 (r(2) = 0.86, P = 0.001). DR in lakes and rivers might reach values doubling those in the more denitrifying terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. agrosystems). Discrepancies in DR and its controlling factors between site-specific studies and this meta-analysis may arise from environmental variability at two, often confounded, scales of observation: the habitat and the ecosystem level. Future studies on denitrification in aquatic environments should address the topic of spatial heterogeneity more thoroughly.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				OCT	2006	81	1					111	130		10.1007/s10533-006-9033-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-006-9033-7													WOS:000240980500008

Here, we construct the Tibetan Plateau Microbial Catalog by sequencing 498 metagenomes from six water ecosystems (saline lakes, freshwater lakes, rivers, hot springs, wetlands and glaciers). Our catalog expands knowledge of regional genomic diversity by presenting 32,355 metagenome-assembled genomes that de-replicated into 10,723 representative genome-based species, of which 88% were unannotated. The catalog contains nearly 300 million non-redundant gene clusters, of which 15% novel, and 73,864 biosynthetic gene clusters, of which 50% novel, thus expanding known functional diversity. Using these data, we investigate the Tibetan Plateau aquatic microbiome's biogeography along a distance of 2,500 km and >5 km in altitude. Microbial compositional similarity and the shared gene count with the Tibetan Plateau microbiome decline along with distance and altitude difference, suggesting a dispersal pattern. The Tibetan Plateau Microbial Catalog stands as a substantial repository for high-altitude aquatic microbiome resources, providing potential for discovering novel lineages and functions, and bridging knowledge gaps in microbiome biogeography.					; Cheng, Mingyue/JGM-3703-2023; Ning, Kang/ABD-3446-2020; zhang, pengshuai/HGF-2832-2022	Cheng, Mingyue/0000-0003-1243-5039; Ba, Sang/0000-0002-7927-8034; Ning, Kang/0000-0003-3325-5387; zhang, peng/0000-0002-0239-3923; 														2041-1723				FEB 16	2024	15	1							1438	10.1038/s41467-024-45895-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45895-8								38365793					WOS:001164810100017

The decline in cyprinids led to a shift from a turbid to a clearwater state in three of the four lakes. In these lakes total nitrogen (N) concentrations decreased and the percentage of N retained in the sediment, or lost by denitrification (N-ret%) increased substantially. In Lake Vaeng, summer N-ret% increased from 22-39% before to 60-72% after the biomass of cyprinids had been reduced by 50%. N-ret% temporarily decreased to 42% during a short-term return to the turbid state. In Lake Engelsholm, a 90% reduction in cyprinids resulted in an increase in summer mean N-ret% from 13-50% to 58-60%, and in Lake Arreskov the annual mean N-ret% increased from -4-34% before a major fish kill to 54-59% after. A comparison with data from 16 non-manipulated lakes revealed that these changes could not be ascribed to natural interannual variations. No significant changes in N concentrations or N-ret% were found in Lake Sobyg (a) over circle rd, which remained turbid and maintained a relatively high biomass of cyprinids. In the three lakes that shifted to a clearwater state, N-ret% was significantly inversely related to chlorophyll-a, but independent of the abundance of submerged macrophytes and biomass of N-fixing cyanobacteria. The increase in N-ret% might have resulted from 1) a decrease in organic N in the lake and the outlet due to the decrease in phytoplankton biomass and thus phytoplankton-N, which was not compensated by an increase in inorganic N, 2) reduced resuspension, probably reflecting both a decrease in the number of fish foraging in the sediment and a suggested increase in benthic algal growth, 3) higher denitrification in the sediment, reflecting less competition between denitrifiers and phytoplankton for nitrate, enhanced N retention by phyto-and zoobenthos and enhanced sediment nitrification due to higher oxygen concentrations, the latter reflecting lower sedimentation, higher density of zoobenthos and higher oxygen production by benthic algae. More research is needed to elucidate the relative importance of these mechanisms. It may, however, be concluded that fish manipulation or phosphorus-loading reduction leading to a shift from a turbid to a clearwater state in eutrophic lakes may markedly enhance lake N-ret% and consequently reduce the transfer of nitrogen to coastal waters.

On average, similar to 70% of bacterial production was consumed by heterotrophic flagellates and similar to 20% by ciliates. Ciliate numbers increased from 5 to 70 cells ml(-1) over the 5-week study period. Ciliates <30 mu m in size were numerically dominant in both layers and included Halteria grandinella and Strobilidium hexakinetum (Oligotrichida), Cyrtolophosis mucicola (Cyrtolophosida), Cinetochilum margaritaceum (Scuticociliatida), Urotricha spp., and Coleps sp. (Prestomatida). Ciliate species-specific grazing rates on bacteria and picocyanobacteria were determined. The highest individual cell grazing rates, 4,200 bacteria and 560 picocyanobacteria cell(-1) h(-1), were observed in Vorticella aquadulcis-complex. Oligotrichs ingested on average 360-2,130 bacteria and 76-210 picocyanobacteria cell(-1) h(-1), with H. grandinella (1,560 bacteria cell(-1) h(-1)), due to its high abundance, as the most important ciliate bacterivore within the system. C. mucicola ingested on average 173 bacteria and 27 cyanobacteria cell(-1) h(-1); C. margaritaceum, 57 bacteria and 7 picocyanobacteria cell(-1) h(-1); and prostomatids, 23-100 bacteria and 2-14 picocyanobacteria cell(-1) h(-1). Although there was a tight relationship between grazing rates on bacteria and picocyanobacteria (r(s) = 0.89, n = 12, P < 0.001), most of the ciliate species preferred larger picoplankton (i.e. picocyanobacteria), as indicated by their clearance rates. According to our data, several oligotrichous ciliate species and Cyclidium sp. can grow in pelagic conditions and exclusively on picoplankton food at rates of one doubling every 24-75 h.

Consequently, identifying and protecting denning habitat is important for grizzly bear management. We evaluated small-scale den-site selection by comparing grizzly bear den sites (n = 21) in the Southern Lakes region, Yukon, Canada to random locations within 100 m of dens. We measured indices of structural stability (slope at den opening, tree and shrub cover, percent soil <2 mm), and security (horizontal cover) at each den site and random location, and used mixed model analysis of variance to determine selection. Our results indicated selection for both steeper slopes and horizontal cover, suggesting that stability and security are important components of den-site selection at small spatial scales.

During droughts, falling lake levels force the Autoridad del Canal de Panam & aacute; to restrict ship transits, disrupting international supply chains. Recent droughts have raised concerns about how climate change could affect canal operations. Here we present new simulations of Gat & uacute;n Lake levels using statistically downscaled, bias-corrected model projections. We find that minimum annual lake levels decline substantially through the 21st century under higher emissions pathways (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), driven primarily by reduced wet season rainfall. Though the magnitude of future drying in Central America remains uncertain, these projections-holding operational practices constant-highlight the growing risk of disruptions without adaptation or emissions mitigation. The Panama Canal illustrates both the need for infrastructure adaptation and emissions reductions to limit economic risk.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 17	2025	52	18							e2025GL117038	10.1029/2025GL117038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025GL117038													WOS:001572135700001

This study outlines a framework for projecting potential impacts of climate change on lakes using linked environmental models. Impacts of climate drivers on catchment hydrology and thermal balance in Onondaga Lake (New York State) are simulated using mechanistic models HSPF and UFILS4. Outputs from these models are fed into a lake ecosystem model, developed in AQUATOX. Watershed simulations project increases in the magnitude of peak flows and consequent increases in catchment nutrient export as the magnitude of extreme precipitation events increases. This occurs concurrently with a decrease in annual stream discharge as a result of increased evapotranspiration. Simulated lake water temperatures increase by as much as 5 degrees C during the 2040-2069 time period, accompanied by a prolonging of the duration of summer stratification. Projected changes include shifts in the timing of nutrient cycling between lake sediments and water column. Plankton taxa projected to thrive under climate change include green algae and Bosmina longirostris. Responses for species at higher trophic levels are mixed. Benthic macroinvertebrates may either prosper (zebra mussels) or decline (chironomids), while fish (e.g., gizzard shad) exhibit high seasonal variability without any clear trend.

Monitoring of the seasonal variations and trends in ice thickness is also important for the operation of winter ice roads that northern communities rely on for the movement of goods as well as for cultural and leisure activities (e.g., snowmobiling). Therefore, consistent measurements of ice thickness over lakes is important; however, field measurements tend to be sparse in both space and time in many northern countries. Here, we present an application of L-band frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) for the estimation of lake ice thickness. The proof of concept is demonstrated through the analysis of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) time series extracted from Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation L1 band raw data acquired between 8 and 22 March (2017 and 2019) at 14 lake ice sites located in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Dominant frequencies are extracted using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE) for the retrieval of ice thickness. Estimates compare favorably with in-situ measurements (mean absolute error = 0.05 m, mean bias error = -0.01 m, and root mean square error = 0.07 m). These results point to the potential of GPS/GNSS-IR as a complementary tool to traditional field measurements for obtaining consistent ice thickness estimates at many lake locations, given the relatively low cost of GNSS antennas/receivers.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; Ghiasi, Yusof/0000-0001-5875-3572; Murfitt, Justin/0000-0002-7388-0964														2072-4292				SEP	2020	12	17							2721	10.3390/rs12172721	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12172721													WOS:000569976800001

Because of its abundance, this filter-feeding clam has the potential to influence nutrient cycling by excretion of metabolic wastes, including NH3 and PO4. Excretion rates of ammonia and orthophosphate were estimated seasonally in Corbicula freshly collected from the Chowan River, a large coastal plain river in eastern Virginia-North Carolina [USA]. Excretion was expressed as a function of clam dry weight, and was highest in May and September for both nutrients. Using Corbicula population estimates from an earlier benthic survey of the Chowan to calculate excretion volumes per square meter suggests that the clams can have a substantial effect on nutrient cycling in summer in the upper Chowan River and a large tributary, the Blackwater River, with ammonia excretion ranging from 357 to 8642 .mu.moles m-2 d-1, and orthophosphate excretion ranging from 161 to 3924 .mu.moles m-2 d-1.																			0887-3593					JUN	1989	8	2					134	139		10.2307/1467631	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467631													WOS:A1989AB03300002

Efficacy of a Short-Term Captive Broodstock Program Compared with Hatchery-Origin Spring Chinook Salmon Derived from the Same Population	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												We examined the efficacy of a one-generation (five brood years: 1997-2001) captive broodstock program for spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha by comparing survival rates of captive broodstock progeny (CBP; F-2) with that of hatchery-origin fish (HOR) from a conservation hatchery supplementation program in which both groups were derived from the Tucannon River (Washington State) population for the 2000-2006 brood years. Survival rates compared were egg to fry, fry to smolt, egg to smolt, total (ages 3-5) and adult (ages 4+) smolt-to-adult-return (SAR) survival, and total (ages 3-5) and adult (ages 4+) progeny-to-parent (P:P) ratio. Total escapement and adult P:P ratios were also examined to determine if observed demographic benefits to the population continued after the captive broodstock program ended. The CBP group had lower within-hatchery survival than the HOR group, with significant differences in survival at the egg-to-fry and egg-to-smolt stages due to poor egg viability. Mean untransformed total and adult SARs for the CBP were half those of the HOR group; however, SARs did not differ significantly. The CBP also had significantly lower total and adult P:P ratios than the HOR group and were below replacement for six of the seven brood years. While the captive broodstock provided additional fish for release that would not have been available otherwise, overall the CBP performed poorly and below expectations compared with the HOR group, both within the hatchery and after release. The captive broodstock program provided a short-term demographic boost, most notable in the 2008-2010 return years, but the benefit did not carry over after the program ended.

A case study of convectively sourced water vapor observed in the overworld stratosphere over the United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												On 27 August 2013, during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys field mission, NASA's ER-2 research aircraft encountered a region of enhanced water vapor, extending over a depth of approximately 2 km and a minimum areal extent of 20,000 km(2) in the stratosphere (375 K to 415 K potential temperature), south of the Great Lakes (42 degrees N, 90 degrees W). Water vapor mixing ratios in this plume, measured by the Harvard Water Vapor instrument, constitute the highest values recorded in situ at these potential temperatures and latitudes. An analysis of geostationary satellite imagery in combination with trajectory calculations links this water vapor enhancement to its source, a deep tropopause-penetrating convective storm system that developed over Minnesota 20 h prior to the aircraft plume encounter. High resolution, ground-based radar data reveal that this system was composed of multiple individual storms, each with convective turrets that extended to a maximum of similar to 4 km above the tropopause level for several hours. In situ water vapor data show that this storm system irreversibly delivered between 6.6 kt and 13.5 kt of water to the stratosphere. This constitutes a 20-25% increase in water vapor abundance in a column extending from 115 hP to 70 hPa over the plume area. Both in situ and satellite climatologies show a high frequency of localized water vapor enhancements over the central U.S. in summer, suggesting that deep convection can contribute to the stratospheric water budget over this region and season.

Bonnet Carre Spillway freshwater transport and corresponding biochemical properties in the Mississippi Bight	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Large freshwater pulses to coastal ecosystems change local hydrologic regimes and alter biogeochemical processes. The Mississippi Bight coastal ecosystem, located in the northern Gulf of Mexico shelf, is influenced by extensive freshwater inputs: the Mississippi River (MSR) and several smaller rivers to the east. Under river flood conditions, MSR waters flow through the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) to relieve pressure on levees in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 2015, mild wintertime temperatures and heavy rainfall throughout the MSR watershed led to extreme flooding and prompted an unusually early BCS opening on January 10, 2016 for 23 days. This study examines the effects of such intermittent freshwater diversions on local shelf circulation, planktonic distributions, and potential contaminant transport pathways. Physical, chemical, and remote sensing data collected one month after the BCS opening suggested the region was comprised of three water masses: shelf saltwater, MSR waters, and local river waters. Observations and circulation model results showed the BCS waters remained within the estuarine lakes and sounds, where winter wind patterns mixed the waters and prevented BCS waters from flowing onto the shelf. Freshwater within the Mississippi Bight was primarily from concurrent flooding of local rivers. Two distinct clusters of microplankton (offshore versus nearshore stations) and zooplankton (Chandeleur Sound versus other stations) community compositions were detected. No algal blooms were observed during this BCS opening. The 2016 wintertime BCS opening resulted in muted effects on the sounds and shelf because of its short duration and uncharacteristically early release.

J	Awramik, SM; Buchheim, HP				Awramik, Stanley M.; Buchheim, H. Paul			Giant stromatolites of the Eocene Green River Formation (Colorado, USA)	GEOLOGY												The Eocene Green River Formation in the Sand Wash Basin, Colorado (United States), contains the largest known lacustrine columnar stromatolites. Spectacular columns, as much as 5.5 m high with diameters of 7 m, occur over a broad area. The stromatolites are composed of laterally continuous centimeter-thick layers that can be traced from the base to the top of the column (synoptic relief), thus these stromatolites stood as much as 5.5 m above the lake floor. The layers consist of one to several different kinds of microbialites, which makes these large columns even more unusual. The giant columns were the result of a combination of factors including the lake transgressing a flooded woodland, in situ tree stumps providing elevated substrates above the lake floor, an abundant supply of calcium-rich spring and surface water that mixed with saline-alkaline lake water, and the subsidence rate of the nearshore lake environment not exceeding the rate at which the stromatolites grew.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				AUG	2015	43	8					691	694		10.1130/G36793.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G36793.1													WOS:000359014600009

We use the first under-ice temperature observations from the largest Tibetan freshwater lake, Ngoring Lake, and a one-dimensional lake model to quantify the mechanism of solar thermal accumulation under ice, which relies on the ice optical properties and weather conditions, as well as the effect of the accumulated heat on the land- atmosphere heat exchange after the ice breakup. The model was able to realistically simulate the feature of the Ngoring Lake thermal regime: the "summer-like" temperature stratification with temperatures exceeding the maximum density point of 3.98 degrees C across the bulk of the freshwater column. A series of sensitivity experiments revealed solar radiation was the major source of under-ice warming and demonstrated that the warming phenomenon was highly sensitive to the optical properties of ice. The heat accumulated under ice contributed to the heat release from the lake to the atmosphere for 12 months after ice-off, increasing the upward sensible and latent surface heat fluxes on average by similar to 50 and similar to 80 W m(-2), respectively. Therefore, the delayed effect of heat release on the land-atmosphere interaction requires an adequate representation in regional climate modeling of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and other lake-rich alpine areas.

We aggregated and reviewed habitat records from several collaborating projects in the Madre de Dios region of Peru. The records originated from opportunistic sampling, intensive surveying, and radio telemetry tracking. We include details on detection, capture, and processing methodology. Our efforts yielded 180 observations of 50 individual E. murinus, four of which were tagged with very high-frequency radio tags and tracked. We report the first presence of E. murinus for several river tributaries and field sites, and provide insight into the species' habitat use. In the western Amazon, E. murinus is cryptic and typically exposed only when basking. Of all radiolocations of tagged individuals, in only 17.7% (n = 23) were individuals observable without disturbance. Well-vegetated embankments were used as basking habitats in aguajales, oxbow lakes, streams, and rivers. On rivers, log jams appeared to be the preferred basking habitat. In oxbow lakes and lakes of aguajales, E. murinus basked on fixed and freefloating vegetation mats. When not basking, radiotracked E. murinus were almost always partially or entirely concealed by fallen logs, detritus, submerged vegetation, inside fallen Mauritia flexuosa trunks, beneath undercut banks, and on one occasion within a burrow of unknown origin. Based on our field observations, basking behaviour should be an important factor for evaluating population densities of this species using survey detection methods in Amazon rainforest systems.

J	Coulson, IM; Dipple, GM; Raudsepp, M				Coulson, IM; Dipple, GM; Raudsepp, M			Evolution of HF and HCl activity in magmatic volatiles of the gold-mineralized Emerald Lake pluton, Yukon Territory, Canada	MINERALIUM DEPOSITA												We examine the halogen contents of biotite, amphibole, and apatite from four magmatic phases of the Emerald Lake pluton to document the evolution in composition of magmatic volatiles in this system, and to determine if this evolution is consistent with the nature and distribution of weak gold mineralization in the pluton. In general, the variations in halogen compositions of hydrous minerals are greater between magmatic phases than within single magma batches, and the abundance of chlorine decreases and fluorine increases in hydrous minerals during the evolution of the Emerald Lake pluton. By applying the internally consistent thermodynamic database and mineral activity-composition relationships that account for coupled site-substitution, we further employ biotite and apatite compositions as independent monitors of fluid composition. Most analyzed biotite exhibits textural and/or compositional features characteristic of late, subsolidus halogen exchange with fluid. However, we have identified biotite that appears to retain halogen contents indicative of magmatic conditions. Fluorine contents of these biotites range from around 1.5 (syenite and monzonite) to greater than 2.2 wt% (in a late-stage pegmatite dike). Chlorine, by contrast, shows a more restricted range of values, and typically falls between 1.0 (syenite and monzonite) and 0.6 wt% (pegmatite). Apatite inclusions within anhydrous phenocrysts have fluorine contents of around 3.3 (syenite) to greater than 3.7 wt% (granite), while chlorine contents fall from 0.5 to 0.1 wt% with evolution from syenite to granite phases of the pluton. The fluid a(HCl)/a(HF) conditions recorded by biotite and apatite are in close agreement. These two independent measures of HCl and HF both show a modest decrease in HCl/HF as the system evolves. The highest log a(HCl)/a(HF)-values (0.6 to 0.3) are associated with magmatic volatiles of syenite, the first phase to intrude at Emerald Lake. Activity ratios recorded from the second phase (monzonite) show a slight fall to similar to0.4 to 0.1. A similar drop is recorded in the transition to hydrothermal activity recorded in biotite from a late pegmatite dike (similar to0.1 to ?0.1). A decrease in log a(HCl)/a(HF) is consistent with a loss of chlorine and residual enrichment of fluorine in the magma, due to progressive release of a chlorine-bearing (metalliferous ?) fluid. The relatively small variation in inferred fluid HCl and HF activity suggests that the magmatic volatiles present during crystallization were relatively homogeneous, and argues against both the incursion of external fluids, and of substantial temporal variation in fluid composition from the magma source. Furthermore, if magmatic volatiles are the source of the gold mineralization found across all phases of the Emerald Lake pluton, as advocated by other workers, our data would suggest that the mineralizing fluids were remarkably homogeneous and distributed throughout the pluton. The disseminated and low-grade nature of mineralization may be, at least in part, a consequence.

We used satellite imagery to study the evolution of 292 lakes across two sites totalling 22 000 kin 2 in area. During 200 1, the lakes combined area increased to 75 +/- 5 km(2) by the beginning of July. Over the following 25 days, an area totalling 36 +/- 3.5 km(2) drained from 216 lakes. At one study site, we used meteorological data and a positive degree day model to calculate the volume of water generated by melting in the lake catchments. Based on this estimate, the mean depth of filling lakes surveyed rose from 1.5 +/- 0.7 m on 7th July to 3.9 +/- 1.1 in on 1st August, in agreement with a value for one lake of 4.4 +/- 0.9 in we have derived from airborne altimetry. During this 25 day period, we estimate that 38 +/- 18 x 10(7) m(3) of water drained from the surface at this site, and that there was an average water flux of 1.3 +/- 0.3 m(3) s(-1) passing through each lake that drained completely.

In Bangladesh, seasonal distribution of these organisms in aquatic environment was studied during July 1986-August 1987. Water, sediment, plant, and plankton samples were collected monthly from the Dhanmondi lake and the Buriganga river during the study period. Aeromonas spp, were isolated from all samples throughout the year. The seasonal peak of Aeromonas spp, was observed in warmer months (April-May) in the surface waters. In the sediment, the highest peak was observed in March and August. In most plants, the highest peak was observed during the winter months (December-February). In the plankton samples of the Dhanmondi lake and the Buriganga river, the highest counts were obtained in July and February respectively. In both the sampling sites, plants were observed to contain more Aeromonas than did the water and sediment samples. The prevalence of Aeromonas spp, throughout the year in aquatic environment suggests the autochthonous nature of these organisms and that there is an association of Aeromonas with the aquatic environment.																			0253-8768					SEP	1995	13	3					183	186											8568196					WOS:A1995TJ44300008

Net pelagic heterotrophy in mesotrophic and oligotrophic basins of a large, temperate lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Understanding the effects of trophic status and dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) on lake carbon cycling is essential for accurate ecosystem carbon models. Using isotopically labelled substrates we assessed spatial and temporal variability in bacterial respiration (BR) and algal primary production (PP) in two trophically, morphometrically and hydrologically different basins in Loch Lomond, a large temperate lake in Scotland. GIS modelling was used to construct a whole lake balance for bacterial production/respiration and PP, and from this the proportion of heterotrophy fuelled by allochthonous carbon was estimated. We tested the hypotheses that trophic status and DOC concentration affect the balance between PP and BR and examined which is the more significant driving factor. Additionally we estimated the percentage of BR that is fuelled by terrestrial carbon. PP varied seasonally and showed inter-basin homogeneity. BR was greatest in the mesotrophic south basin in autumn, which corresponded to measured peak DOC input, though over an annual cycle no relationship was observed between BR and DOC concentration. The PP:BR ratio was 0.37 +/- A 0.30 and 0.3 +/- A 0.45 in the north and south basins, respectively, assuming a bacterial growth efficiency of 0.1. We have found that allochthonous carbon potentially supports a substantial quantity of pelagic production, even during periods of high photosynthesis. Less productive systems are thought to be dominated by heterotrophic processes. However, we have found that the mesotrophic basin of a large lake to be as heterotrophic as its neighbouring oligotrophic basin, an observation that has implications for our understanding of modelling of the role of lakes in linking the terrestrial-atmospheric carbon cycle.

Sedimentation rates were able to be calculated using the Pb-210 and Po-210 methods in 26 out of 28 cores. For the Cs-137 method (shown equivalent to the previous methods) calculable rates were obtained in 13 out of 19 cores. An age estimation was always possible by one of the methods. Values of Pm-147 and Ce-144 showed that most surface layers were undisturbed, hence the hypothetical mixing often invoked to explain Cs-137 profiles lacking the expected 1965 peak is incorrect for most of these cores. Deficits in surface layer Pb-210 caused by Rn-222 loss did not affect the estimates of sedimentation rate. One core contained a record dated back to 1800 A.D. Deposition rates of Pb-210 depended on rainfall, not river input. Some local geothermal activity emits Rn-222 and deposits more Pb-210 than usual for New Zealand lakes, but otherwise absolute Pb-210 levels are generally very low compared to other studies. Deposition rates varied from a low of 0.11 kg m(-2) yr(-1) (Lake Tikitapu) to a high of 28 kg m(-2) yr(-1) (one Lake Pukaki core).

Concentrations of metals (cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, selenium, and zinc) and of inorganic anions (sulfate, sulfite, sulfide, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, cyanide, thiocyanate, halogens carbonate, silicate, and phosphate) were generally lower than those reported for other lakes of Egypt which are used as wastewater reservoirs. The concentrations of metals and inorganic anions in water varied according to the distance from the origin of the lakes, depth, and seasons of the year. Concentrations of heavy metals in fish and in selected wild life fauna and flora of the surrounding deserts were also determined. Animals living near the lakes had much higher concentration of heavy metals, particularly lead, mercury, and cadmium, than animals of the same species collected further away from the lakes.

Abrupt climate change and its influences on hominin evolution during the early Pleistocene in the Turkana Basin, Kenya	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Rapid climate variability has been hypothesized to play an important role in hominin evolution, yet our knowledge of Plio-Pleistocene climate change on short timescales is poor. Here, we developed centennial-scale reconstructions of precipitation from leaf wax biomarker hydrogen isotope ratios (delta D-wax) using lacustrine sediment from West Turkana, Kenya. We analyzed two time intervals (similar to 1.72 and similar to 1.60 Ma) with different orbital configurations (0.043 and 0.025 eccentricity, respectively) to examine the influence of seasonal insolation forcing on high-frequency climate variability and the rates of climate transitions. Our data indicate that under low summer insolation, which should induce high latitude glaciation and tropical African aridity, millennial-scale climate variability was stronger. This suggests that hominins may have been forced to contend with increased climate variability during already extreme environmental conditions. Additionally, we observe a rapid shift from arid to humid conditions occurring in less than 200 years under high-amplitude precessional-scale insolation change. The rate of this transition is similar to that observed in some proxy records of the onset of the African Humid Period, indicating high sensitivity to gradual insolation forcing in the Turkana Basin. Such abrupt climate changes could induce evolutionary selection for generalist behavioral traits in hominins. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Model to Approximate Lake Temperature from Gridded Daily Air Temperature Records and Its Application in Risk Assessment for the Establishment of Fish Diseases in the UK	TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES												Ambient water temperature is a key factor controlling the distribution and impact of disease in fish populations, and optimum temperature ranges have been characterised for the establishment of a number important aquatic diseases exotic to the UK. This study presents a simple regression method to approximate daily average surface water temperature in lakes of 0.5-15ha in size across the UK using 5km(2) gridded daily average air temperatures provided by the UK Meteorological Office. A Geographic information system (GIS) is used to present thematic maps of relative risk scores established for each grid cell based on the mean number of days per year that water temperature satisfied optimal criteria for the establishment of two economically important pathogens of cyprinid fish (koi herpesvirus (KHV) and spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV)) and the distribution and density of fish populations susceptible to these viruses. High-density susceptible populations broadly overlap the areas where the temperature profiles are optimal for KHV (central and south-east England); however, few fish populations occur in areas where temperature profiles are most likely to result in the establishment of spring viremia of carp (SVC) (namely northern England and Scotland). The highest grid-cell risk scores for KHV and SVC were 7 and 6, respectively, out of a maximum score of 14. The proportion of grid cells containing susceptible populations with risk scores of 5 or more was 37% and 5% for KHV and SVC, respectively. This work demonstrates a risk-based approach to inform surveillance for exotic pathogens in aquatic animal health management, allowing efficient use of resources directed towards higher risk animals and geographic areas for early disease detection. The methodology could be used to examine the change in distribution of high-risk areas for both exotic and endemic fish diseases under different climate change scenarios.																			1865-1674	1865-1682				OCT	2013	60	5					460	471		10.1111/j.1865-1682.2012.01368.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2012.01368.x								22862828					WOS:000324018800009
J	Wu, XD; Wang, Y; Bian, L; Shen, J				Wu, Xudong; Wang, Yong; Bian, Liu; Shen, Ji			Diagenetic effects on magnetic minerals in a Holocene lacustrine sediment core from Huguangyan maar lake, southeast China	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Post-depositional reductive diagenesis usually results in partial or entire cleansing of the pristine palaeomagnetic signal, therefore, its intensity is important to be assessed for sediments that are in the purpose of retrieving palaeomagnetic information. Grain size, rock magnetic and geochemical studies on the entire core, along with scanning electron microscope observations and X-ray diffraction analyses for representative samples were carried out on a Holocene sediment core retrieved from the deep water part of Huguangyan maar lake (HGY), southeast China. The pristine magnetic mineral assemblage of the studied core is domianted by superparamagnetic (SP) and stable single domain titanomagnetite, and high coercivity minerals are not detectable. Based on down-core variations of the average grain size (M-Z), total organic carbon (TOC), detrital elements (Al, Ti, Fe and Mn) and the concentration and mineralogy of magnetic minerals, the studied core could be divided into three subsections. The uppermost subsection is the least affected by diagenesis, with detrital titanomagnetite as the dominant magnetic mineral. This is owing to low TOC contents, but high detrital input generated by weak Asian summer monsoon intensity during the late Holocene. The intermediate subsection shows down-core progressively enhanced dissolution of detrital titanomagnetite, and concomitant formation of authigenic pyrite and siderite, which indicates down-core progressively enhanced diagenesis generated by down-core progressive increasing TOC content, but decreasing detrital input as the result of down-core progressively strengthened Asian summer monsoon intensity. The pristine magnetic mineral assemblage has been profoundly modified in the lowermost subsection. At certain positions of the lowermost subsection, detrital titanomagnetite has been even completely dissolved via diagenesis, giving place to authigenic pyrite and siderite. High TOC content, but low detrital input generated from strong Asian summer monsoon intensity during the early Holocene are accountable for intensive diagenesis in the lowermost subsection. Complete erasing of detrital magnetic input signal at certain positions of the lowermost subsection, and considerable formation of authigenic siderite indicate that palaeomagnetic records of the studied core have been significantly compromised. The studied core has relatively higher TOC content, lower detrital matter content, calmer sedimentary environments, and less DO available at its water-sediment interface than the cores retrieved at relatively shallower water depths, which all contribute to its relatively stronger diagenesis. Progressive thickening of the upper two subsections with increasing water depth is owing to progressive increase in sedimentation rate with increasing water depth, which is the key factor in determining the thickness of each diagenetic subsection of cores from HGY. It would be better that lake sediments for palaeomagnetic investigations collected at a water depth shallower than the depth of its thermocline.					wu, xudong/KGL-1857-2024														0956-540X	1365-246X				SEP	2016	206	3					1586	1598		10.1093/gji/ggw223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw223													WOS:000384650400012

Investigation of Water Quality Index of River Noyyal and Its Connected Ponds Coimbatore Tamilnadu India	ORIENTAL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												This investigation deals with the determination of various physico-chemical and biological parameters of surface water quality of river Noyyal and its connected ponds at Coimbatore, India. Based on their significance, the sampling locations were selected. There are five sampling locations were selected like river Noyyal at sorce (S-1), Perur Lake, (S-2), Ukkadam Pond (S-3), Singanallur Lake (S-4) and Sulur Pond (S-5), and samples were collected from each locations at river Noyyal basin in and around Coimbatore district. The surface water quality index determination is prerequisite and essential. In this present work, from different methods of water quality determination, the most commonly used index of National Sanitation Foundation water quality index (NSF-WQI) has been followed.The physico-chemical and biological parameters such as dissolved oxygen, faecal coliforms counts, pH, biochemical oxygen demand, phosphate, nitrates, turbidity, and total dissolved solids were investigated. Except in Noyyal river at source (S-1) all the measured parameters are showed to be very high pollution compared to limits suggested by WHO particularly during summer season and thereby it is not suitable for public use.

J	Pentecost, A				Pentecost, A			Taxonomic identity, ecology and distribution of the calcite-depositing cyanobacterium Phormidium incrustatum (Oscillatoriaceae)	CRYPTOGAMIE ALGOLOGIE												The morphology of the common and widely distributed calcite-encrusted cyanobacterium Phormidium incrustatum (Ndg.) Gomont is redescribed. Numerical analysis indicated that the species was conservative for trichome width and cell length but not for end cell characteristics. Phormidium incrustatum colonised travertine (calcium carbonate deposits) in alkaline streamwaters, low in dissolved orthophosphate but high in nitrate-nitrogen. Stream sites were often surrounded by trees, and a bimodal seasonal illumination regime occurred. Biomass, measured as biovolume, was low for this species, averaging 0.28 mm(3) cm(-2) and resulted from the low illumination regime imposed by calcite deposition and tree shading. No significant correlation was found between the biomass of Phormidium and rate of travertine deposition, and the taxonomic value of calcification in this cyanobacterium is questioned. The species has a worldwide distribution currently spanning latitudes 54degreesN to 30degreesS. It is common on shaded spring-deposited travertine, and in the encrusted littoral zone of calcareous lakes. In some populated regions, the species has been lost as a result of water pollution or channel modification.																			0181-1568					NOV	2003	24	4					307	321																WOS:000188397700002

The incidence of femur fractures averaged 0.8 per 100,000 days of skiing and accounted for 0.4% of reported accidents in this series. Skiers sustaining femur fractures had a mean age of 30.2 years, significantly older than the skier mean age overall. Comminuted femoral shaft and trochanteric fractures that were the result of high-energy impact most often occurred in advanced skiers in firm or icy conditions. Firm ski conditions provided the most striking correlation to this type of fracture in the older age groups. In skeletally immature individuals (< 18 years of age), the femur fractures were mainly of the low-energy impact and minimally comminuted variety and were produced by an indirect, torsional, or bending mechanism. This injury typically occurred while skiing fast and resulted from catching the tip of a ski in wet or heavy snow. The majority of fractures (55%) occurred in the young adult population (18-45 years of age). Being predominantly advanced skiers, most of their fractures were the result of a high-energy, direct-impact fall or collision that led to severely comminuted femoral shaft and trochanteric fractures. Nineteen percent of those injured were >45 years of age. More than two thirds of these individuals sustained fractures about the hip, typically a simple fracture in low-impact falls on hard or icy surfaces. No person >52 years old sustained a fracture to the femoral shaft.																			0890-5339					AUG	1994	8	4					310	314		10.1097/00005131-199408000-00006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00005131-199408000-00006								7965292					WOS:A1994NY38900006

Here we present a high-resolution fire history for the past similar to 15,500 years from a sediment core in Dali Lake, located in the foothills of the Greater Hinggan Mountains, one of the areas of highest fire risk in China. The results demonstrate that fire activity was rare during the last deglaciation (similar to 15,500-11,700 yr BP), gradually increased at the beginning of the Holocene, and reached its highest level during similar to 9000-5000 yr BP, after which there was a decreasing trend. However, after similar to 2000 yr BP this decreasing trend ended, and the most prominent feature is a peak in fire activity during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Overall, fire activity corresponded well to changes in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation on the millennial timescale during similar to 15,500-2000 yr BP, but this relationship changed after similar to 2000 yr BP. We propose that fire activity in northern China on the millennial timescale during similar to 15,500-2000 yr BP was dominated by the biofuels reserve under the control of the EASM precipitation. In contrast, with the intensification of human activities after similar to 2000 yr BP, human activity caused a similar to 62%-73% increase in fire activity, which altered the fire-climate relationship that had previously prevailed in northern China. Our results indicate that a wet-warm climate (increased EASM intensity), rather than a dry-cold climate, was the dominant control on fire activity in northern China during 15,500-2000 yr BP on the millennial timescale, but that human activities played an important role in fire occurrence after similar to 2000 yr BP.

The consistency between the stratigraphic position and the apparent age at each of the sampling sites strongly supports the reliability of the ages. Most of the ages fall with two clusters that are coincident with ages representative of oceanic oxygen-isotope stages 5 and 7. The colder intervening stage 6 was not a period of substantial travetine formation. During the warmer global episodes of isotopic stages 5 and 7 the arid south of Israel apparently was considerably wetter than at present.																			0033-5894	1096-0287					1985	24	2					164	172		10.1016/0033-5894(85)90003-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(85)90003-1													WOS:A1985APH4700003

The authors investigated the rotifer community structure and environmental factors in upper Shengjin Lake from February to July of 2014. A total of 17 genera and 31 species of rotifers were identified, the dominant species being Brachionus angularis, Brachionus calyciflorus, Asplanchna priodonta, and Schizocerca diversicornis. Rotifer density and the nutrient salt content were higher in the areas inhabited by migratory birds. The highest density (176.0 ind./L) was recorded in June, the lowest (14.0 ind./L) in April. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and correlation analysis showed that some environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, water depth, Secchi depth (SD), and chlorophyll a concentration, had a considerable effect on the lake's rotifer community structure.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2016	23	8					8076	8084		10.1007/s11356-015-6009-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-6009-y								26780056					WOS:000374994600097

This study highlights perhaps the most visible manifestation of the link between convection over two or more of the Great Lakes lake-to-lake (L2L) cloud bands. Emphasis is placed on L2L cloud bands observed in high-resolution satellite imagery on 2 December 2003. These L2L cloud bands developed over Lake Superior and were modified as they passed over Lakes Michigan and Erie and intervening land areas. This event is put into a longer-term context through documentation of the frequency with which lake-effect and, particularly, L2L cloud bands occurred over a 5-yr time period over different areas of the Great Lakes region.

In this study, we evaluated potential effects of water impoundment and seasonal water-level manipulation on the bioaccumulation, trophic transfer and health risk of HMs (Cu, Fe, Zn, Hg, Cd and Pb) in food web components (seston, aquatic invertebrate and fish) in TGR. Our results show that, after the impoundment for eight years (2003-2010), all of the six metal concentrations in aquatic biota fell within the criteria of safety quality guidelines. The concentrations of Cu, Fe, Zn and Hg in fish and aquatic invertebrates were higher than those before impoundment, whereas Cd and Pb were lower than those before impoundment. Nonetheless, Hg, Cd and Pb in aquatic consumers underwent an increasing trend during the entire impoundment, implying potential reservoir effect in the future. Only the concentrations of Hg, Cd and Pb in aquatic consumers exhibited a declining trend towards the dam, showing consistent with the background level at the three reaches. Seasonal variations in HM concentrations of fish and aquatic invertebrates were ascribed to the water-level manipulation associated with reservoir management. Our findings show that Hg or Cd biomagnified through aquatic food web during different hydrological periods, whereas Pb, Cu, Fe and Zn exhibited weak biomagnification power. Overall, Hg, Cd and Pb showed a higher risk than that of Cu, Fe and Zn. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of ecological and anthropogenic factors on waterbird abundance at a Ramsar Site in the Yangtze River Floodplain	AMBIO												Continuing declines in abundance of many waterbird species on wetland ecosystems require explanations to support effective management interventions. We used 6 year survey data from Shengjin Lake National Nature Reserve in the Yangtze River Floodplain, China, to study the effects of ecological and anthropogenic variables as determinants of waterbird species abundance. Our results showed that effects were guild-dependent, although distance to nearest human settlements had the largest adverse effects on bird abundance across all guilds. These results suggested that although the abundance of waterbird species could be affected by habitat conditions and buffalo grazing activities, Yangtze River Wetlands would most likely benefit most from reduced pressure from the proximity to the surrounding human population. We suggest that screening and/or restricting public access at some key sites may be the most cost-efficient way to restrict or reduce human activity in these wetlands, to improve the conservation status and wintering conditions for these waterbirds.					; LU, Changhu/LBI-4341-2024	Prins, Herbert/0000-0003-1131-5107; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; lu, zhang hu/0000-0002-8607-7134; Zhang, Yong/0000-0001-7054-4634													0044-7447	1654-7209				MAR	2019	48	3					293	303		10.1007/s13280-018-1076-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-1076-1								29987519					WOS:000458934100007

It is concluded that 1) Three lake shoreline sets were classified in the Qinghai Lake Basin with the corresponding elevations of 3220-3260, 3206-3215 and 3194-3205 m. 2) C-14 dating on lake sediments is restricted by the upper dating limit of similar to 35 thousand years (ka) BP in practice, availability of dating materials and reservoir effect, and that quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages older than 80-60 ka may be underestimated while feldspar post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) ages could be reliable for dating these older samples. 3) Four highstands were detected by ages. The highest lake-levels at elevations of 3220-3260 m with 26-66 m above the present lake-level occurred in MIS 5, and highstands also occurred in MIS 3 (similar to 42-38 ka), the last deglaciation (similar to 16-12 ka), and the Holocene (similar to 6-5 ka) with similar heights at elevations of similar to 3200-3209 m. During the Holocene, lake-levels were relatively low in the early Holocene (similar to 11-8 ka), increasing substantially after similar to 8 ka and reaching the highest lake-levels (elevation of 3203.1 m) at similar to 6-5 ka, then decreasing with an interruption by a highstand (elevation of 3202.4 m) at similar to 1.8 ka. 4) Shoreline-based lake-level variations are consistent with major climatic proxies (e.g., delta C-1(3)org and % thaum) of drilling cores from the lake, regional aeolian activity/pedogenesis and climate change. 5) Compared with the representative lake-levels and moisture records in the Westerlies and East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) dominances, it is suggested that lake-level variations in the southern Qilian Mountains exhibited simultaneity with changes in the intensity of EASM, while those in the northern part were synchronous with the moisture records in arid central Asia, suggesting that EASM did not extend further to the northern Qilian Mountains where the Westerlies prevailed.

The aims of the study were to know the main trophic roles and ecological significance of ciliates in a highly productive environment. A low number of taxa (27) and a wide abundance fluctuation (104-387 cil ml(-1)) were found. The most abundant species (up to 162 cil ml(-1)) was Halteria grandinella, an oligotrich ciliate that graze on bacteria and picoplankton, but also several big body sized species that feed on pico and nanoplankton were abundant. Sudden temporal changes in species dominance occurred. Ciliate biomass was very high and fluctuated widely (1.6-88 10(6) mu m(3) ml(-1)) being dominated by the >50 mu m size fraction that mainly included the pico and nanoplankton feeders. Ciliates are a very important component in the plankton of hypertrophic lakes and their main control factor seems to be the grazing by big-body size Daphnia species.

NONLINEAR REGRESSION APPLICATIONS IN MODELING OVER-DISPERSION OF BIRD POPULATIONS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												The aim of this study was to statistically evaluate bird populations in Akdogan Lakes by means of Poisson and negative binomial regression models. The over-dispersion value in Poisson regression was much higher than 1.0 (33.827). In contrast, the value of over-dispersion in the negative binomial regression was very close to 1.0 (1.598). Therefore, the parameter estimates were interpreted considering the negative binomial regression. When spring season was considered as a reference parameter, the change in population densities in other seasons was not statistically significant. The population changes in other habitats were not statistically significant, when reed area was considered as a reference parameter. The change in the population density of 13 ordo groups is non significant when the Anseriformes order was evaluated as reference parameter. The population change in the Gruiiformes population was 11.951 times higher compared with the change in reference parameter and the change was statistically significant (p <0.01). As a result, it is recommendable to use negative binomial regression with the scope of removing over-dispersion problem in the bird population modeling.

In the present study, we used satellite data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST products to study the land surface phenology (LSP) of alpine grasslands in response to LST changes in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB), which is on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results showed that LSP, including the start (SOS), end (EOS), and length (GSL) of the growing season, presented high spatial heterogeneity and had significant correlation with landform elevations. Both averaged SOS and EOS across QLB were advanced from 2001 to 2017, but the greater advancement of SOS compared to that of EOS led to an overall prolonged GSL. Daytime LST (LSTd) and nighttime LST (LSTn) had the contrasting effects on SOS (i.e., SOS can be delayed with the increase in LSTd, while it can be advanced with the increase in LSTn). However, increase in LSTd and LSTn in August had the same advancing effect on EOS. Moreover, LSTd played the dominant role in controlling the grassland phenology. Specifically, an 1 degrees C increase in the LSTd in the nongrowing season (i.e., from previous October to April) significantly postponed the SOS by 2.2 d and advanced the EOS by 1.1 d in August. This study highlights the utility and biological relevance of LST in research of grassland phenology and differential impacts of daytime and nighttime LST on grassland phenology.					; Guo, Weibin/ABE-8517-2021	Li, Xiaoting/0000-0003-1211-9132; Zhang, Junzhe/0000-0003-0215-7514													2150-8925					JUN	2021	12	6							e03578	10.1002/ecs2.3578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3578													WOS:000667707100020

One of the most frequently discussed research problems is the possibility of using long-term ice phenology as an indicator of changes of the thermal conditions of ambient air. The study used correlation analysis and regression models in order to determine changes in the parameters studied over time. In order to compare the ice regime of the study reservoir and other lakes in the region, discriminant function analysis, principal components analysis (PCA), and canonical redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied. During the 52 winter seasons studied (1964-2015), there were weak but still statistically significant trends concerning the increase in air temperature in the region (by 0.3 degrees C per decade), the reduction in the number of days with ice cover (by 8.6 days per decade) and the decline in the maximum and average thicknesses of lake ice (by 2.0 cm and 1.2 cm per decade). The low average depth and volume capacity are reflected in the rapid freezing rate of the reservoir, and its location results in a longer duration of ice cover, greater ice thickness, and later dates of its melting.

Diversity of rotifers (Rotifera, Eurotatoria) of Loktak lake, Manipur, North-eastern India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												The rotifer communities of Loktak lake (a Ramsar site), Manipur, N.E. India, contain 120 species belonging to 36 genera and 19 families and represent the richest biodiversity of Phylum Rotifera known from any aquatic ecosystem of the Indian subcontinent. Biogeographically interesting elements include one Australasian, three Oriental and seven Palaeotropical species. Cosmopolitan species (69.2%) show higher richness while Cosmotropical > Pantropical species are well represented. The rotifer fauna is characterized by notable richness of Lecanidae > Lepadellidae > Trichocercidae > Brachionidae, general 'tropical character', occurrence of several acidophilic species, and a paucity of Brachionus spp. The richness (47-79; mean +/- SD 57 +/- 10 species) follows multimodal pattern of monthly variations with a peak during winter. The rotifer communities have 52.3-80.6% temporal similarity, and show lack of seasonal periodicity of occurrence of different families. The Rotifera form an important quantitative component of zooplankton (45.8 +/- 8.1%), and have higher species diversity, lower dominance and higher evenness. Richness and density are inversely correlated with water, temperature, rainfall, hardness, nitrate, chloride and total dissolved solids and positively correlated with dissolved oxygen. In addition, richness is inversely correlated with pH.																			0564-3295	2661-8982				WIN	2009	50	2					277	285																WOS:000269413300008

Whilst much attention has concentrated on understanding freshwater populations of the species, marine populations have received less research attention, with the majority of marine studies focusing on determining abundance and distribution. As part of The Cambodian Marine Mammal Conservation Project, the current study utilises a combination of year-long land and boat survey techniques to identify seasonal critical habitats for the species in Cambodia's Kep Archipelago, as well as fill knowledge gaps on the species' behavioural ecology, to contribute to the design of effective and tailored regional conservation strategies. Results showed Irrawaddy dolphins to be present in the Kep Archipelago in all seasons, with the highest encounter rates in Summer Monsoon (May-September) and Post-Monsoon (October-November) seasons, and the lowest encounter rates in Pre-Monsoon season (March-April). Juveniles were present in all seasons, suggesting the region represents an important nursing ground for the population. Foraging was the most commonly observed behaviour, with significant associations found between certain behavioural states and events, group sizes and seasons, group sizes and juvenile presence, and swim styles and juvenile presence.

J	Seijmonsbergen, AC; Woning, MP; Verhoef, PNW; de Graaff, LW				Seijmonsbergen, AC; Woning, MP; Verhoef, PNW; de Graaff, LW			The failure mechanism of a late glacial sturzstrom in the subalpine Molasse (Leckner valley, Vorarlberg, Austria)	GEOMORPHOLOGY					IAG Symposium on the Relationships Between Man and the Mountain Environment in Terms of Geomorphological Hazards and Human Impact in Europe	JUL, 2002	Dornbirn, AUSTRIA	Int Assoc Geomophologists				A number of prehistoric landslides and rock avalanches occurred in the folded and faulted section of the Molasse Zone in Vorarlberg, Austria. Some developed into a Sturzstrom, defined as a 'rapidly moving fluidised mass movement of large volumes of rock, derived from the disintegration of a falling rock mass, that spread under the influence of gravity'. Their impact on the landscape usually is related to obstruction of rivers and valleys. In this paper, we analyse the geomorphology and the failure mechanism of a relative small 'Sturzstrom'. The failure mechanism can be described as a 'buckling failure'. The morphological situation indicates that failure took place after local deglaciation by the end of the Upper Wurm. The period of failure coincides with glacial and ice-marginal remnants, which developed between 15.000 and 14.600 BP. The lithological sequence and rock structure, as well as the impact of the processes related to the former glacial environment, were major causal conditions. The rock sequence consists of conglomerates, sandstone layers, and marls. Next to glacial scouring, which increased the inclination of the valley slopes, the effect of lateglacial unloading and postglacial processes, such as weathering and fluvial erosion, subsequently weakened the mass rock fabric until failure occurred. Discontinuity orientation measurements, geostructural and geomechanical conditions, and the former hydrological and geomorphological conditions support bucklings failure. In fact, three-hinge buckling may have occurred. The frontal section of the Sturzstrom consists mainly of large conglomerate blocks, averaging 1.5 m(3) in volume, although megablocks, reaching of up to 4000 m(3), are present as well. The volume of the entire Sturzstrom equals approximately 10 X 10(7) m(3). Present activity is only restricted to minor rock falls derived from the conglomerates and mudflows originating from the marl layers. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nine clinical research centers (CRC) in sub-Saharan Africa conducted HIV observational epidemiology studies in populations at risk for HIV infection as part of an HIV prevention and vaccine trial network. Annual HIV incidence ranged from below 2% to above 10% and varied by CRC and risk group, with rates above 5% observed in Zambian men in an HIV-discordant relationship, Ugandan men from Lake Victoria fishing communities, men who have sex with men, and several cohorts of women. HIV incidence tended to fall after the first three months in the study and over calendar time. Among suspected transmission pairs, 28% of HIV infections were not from the reported partner. Volunteers with high incidence were successfully identified and enrolled into large scale cohort studies.

Polarimetric Doppler Radar Observations of Kelvin-Helmholtz Waves in a Winter Storm	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Kelvin-Helmholtz waves were observed by the Twin Lakes, Oklahoma (KTLX), Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D); the Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN), polarimetric WSR-88D; and the polarimetric Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) radars on 30 November 2006 during a winter storm in central Oklahoma. The life cycle and structure of the waves are analyzed from the radar data, and the nearby atmospheric conditions are examined. The initial perturbations associated with the waves are first evident only in the radars' radial velocity fields. As the waves mature, perturbations become discernable in the reflectivity factor Z and spectrum width (SW) fields of both radars, and in the differential reflectivity Z(dr) and, to a lesser extent, the cross-correlation coefficient rho(hv) fields of KOUN. As the waves break and begin to dissipate, the perturbations subside. A dual-Doppler analysis is synthesized to examine the kinematic structure of the waves and to relate the polarimetric observations to the kinematics. It is determined that Z and Z(dr) are enhanced in regions of upward motion (wave crests), and rho(hv) is reduced in the same vicinity and near the base of the wave circulations. Vertical velocity perturbations transport horizontal momentum upward and downward, inducing horizontal wind perturbations that are approximately 90 degrees out of phase and downstream from their corresponding vertical velocity perturbations. Perturbations in Z, Z(dr), and rho(hv) observed in the vicinity of wave crests while SW perturbations occur predominately in and just upstream from wave troughs. It is determined that perturbations in the polarimetric variables are a result of the waves modifying local precipitation microphysics. Perturbations in Z and Z(dr) are hypothesized to be the result of columnar ice crystal generation whereas those in rhv likely result from the mixing of ice crystals of various shapes and sizes. Perturbations in SW are a result of turbulent motions likely associated with wave breaking and downward advection of a strong shear layer.					; Bluestein, Howard/N-5452-2019	Houser, Jana/0000-0003-2452-2535; 													0022-4928					AUG	2011	68	8					1676	1702		10.1175/2011JAS3566.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2011JAS3566.1													WOS:000293622300008

On thin ice: Linking elevation and long-term losses of lake ice cover	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Despite long-term analyses of lake ice phenology globally, comparatively little is known about high-elevation lakes, for which climate shifts are thought to be occurring faster than at lower elevations. Using a 36-yr dataset (1983-2018) on alpine lakes (> 3000 m ASL) from the Green Lakes Valley, Colorado (GLV), we found that ice-cover duration decreased by an average of similar to 24 d, due to both earlier ice-off (9 d) and especially later ice-on (15 d). Spring ice thickness also decreased by 0.88 cm yr(-1). By comparison, ice-cover duration in the GLV is decreasing similar to 50% faster than for Northern Hemisphere lakes (n = 215), which translates to an increase in open water duration similar to 2.5 times more in the GLV than the average of the Northern Hemisphere. Our analytical comparison demonstrated more rapid trends in this alpine region compared to lakes more broadly, and especially emphasized the influence of elevation on lake ice phenology.

Here, we review the magnitude and timing of tributary export and plume formation in Lake Superior, how these patterns and interactions may shift with global change, and how emerging technologies can be used to better characterize tributary-lake linkages. Peak tributary export occurs during snowmelt-driven spring freshets, with additional pulses during rain-driven storms. Instream processing and transformation of nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can be rapid but varies seasonally in magnitude. Tributary plumes with elevated DOC concentration, higher turbidity, and distinct DOM character can be detected in the nearshore during times of high runoff, but plumes can be quickly transported and diluted by in-lake currents and mixing. Understanding the variability in size and load of these tributary plumes, how they are transported within the lake, and how long they persist may be best addressed with environmental sensors and remote sensing using autonomous and unmanned vehicles. The connections between Lake Superior and its tributaries are vulnerable to climate change, and understanding and predicting future changes to these valuable freshwater resources will require a nuanced and detailed consideration of tributary inputs and interactions in time and space.					; Kane, Evan/IAN-1625-2023; Brooks, Colin/AAF-2128-2020; Marcarelli, Amy/J-3017-2012	Brooks, Colin/0000-0003-4544-2569; Coble, Ashley/0000-0002-5821-5026; Green, Sarah/0000-0002-8094-433X; Buffam, Ishi/0000-0002-2625-6640; Marcarelli, Amy/0000-0002-4175-9211; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2019	55	2					442	458		10.1111/1752-1688.12695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12695													WOS:000464285900013

Flooding caused by the expansion of lakes beyond normal shorelines occurred during the summer of 2020 and provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the capabilities of remote sensing platforms to map surface water expansion into vegetated landscape with complex surface connectivity. Firstly, multi-source remotely sensed data via satellites were used to create a temporal reconstruction of the event spanning May to September. Optical synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and altimeter data were used to reconstruct surface water area and elevation as seen from space. Lastly, temporal water surface area and level data obtained from the existing satellites and hydrometric stations were used as input data in the CNES Large-Scale SWOT Simulator, which provided an overview of the newly launched SWOT satellite ability to monitor such flood events. The results show a 25% smaller water surface area for optical instruments compared to SAR. Simulations show that SWOT would have greatly increased the spatio-temporal understanding of the flood dynamics with complete PAD coverage three to four times per month. Overall, seasonal vegetation growth was a major obstacle for water surface area retrieval, especially for optical sensors.

Magnetochronostratigraphic Data From Three Sediment Cores Recovered From the SE Pacific, Off Patagonia, Chile	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Three long sediment cores recovered from the SE Pacific were subjected to a comprehensive magnetostratigraphic investigation. According to the partly preliminary age models obtained, the cores reach 48, 140, and 482 ka back in time, respectively. At two sites (PC02 and PC03 at similar to 46 degrees S) sedimentation rates are highly variable, ranging from about 2 to 100 cmka-1, whereas sedimentation rates are significantly lower at the southernmost site (PC04, similar to 51 degrees S), ranging from about 1 to 20 cmka-1. All three cores provide evidence for the Laschamps geomagnetic excursion at 41 ka. However, the excursion was recorded during times of low sedimentation rates and thus, only little detail on geomagnetic field variability could be obtained. Nevertheless, the excursion is documented in inclination and declination, thus as a full reversal, and is associated with a deep low in relative paleointensity. At site PC04, the Iceland Basin excursion (similar to 195 ka) was also recorded as a short almost reversed phase, followed by an apparently long phase of non-dipolar directions, all associated with a deep low in paleointensity. This is interpreted as the result of variable sedimentation rates not resolved by the preliminary age model of the core. A directional anomaly coinciding with a deep low in paleointensity at around 220 ka is interpreted as the Pringle Falls excursion. Besides these findings, no evidence for further excursions could be found in the studied cores.					; Arz, Helge/A-6659-2013	Harada, Naomi/0000-0002-2725-7346; 													2169-9313	2169-9356				FEB	2025	130	2							e2024JB030137	10.1029/2024JB030137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JB030137													WOS:001421936900001

Using a supervised classification algorithm, measured backscatter values (converted to dB) for three ice types and calm water were applied to an 8 x 8 pixel averaged ERS-2 calibrated SAR image. Certain assumptions were made on the local incidence angle, one of which was that any change in incidence angle across a distributed target was neglected, i.e. a distributed target corresponds to one average value of the incidence angle (23 degrees was used). Although the calculated overall uncertainty was about +/- 1 dB as a result of the averaging and incidence angle effect, an algorithm to correct for power loss and local incidence angle effect is applied in this study to the ERS-2 image, resulting in a more accurate classification.

It is argued that either cyanobacteria should not be treated as a group or that more information is needed. It is suggested that the required piece of information is that non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have low competitiveness for nitrate nitrogen sources and high competitiveness for ammonium nitrogen sources. Supporting evidence from enclosure experiments with low-dose phosphate additions, and either ammonium- or nitrate-nitrogen in two lakes is presented. In both lakes, depletion of nitrate-nitrogen occurred before cyanobacteria started to develop. In the oligotrophic, low-alkaline, clearwater Lake Njupfatet, a non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, Merismopedia tenuissima usually dominates during late summer. Concurrent with Merismopedia's dominance, nitrate additions in one enclosure led to successively increased importance of dinoflagellates, whereas Merismopedia remained dominant in the enclosure to which ammonium was added. In a second experiment, performed in early summer, Merismopedia failed to become dominant after nitrate additions which led rather to complete dominance of dinoflagellates. Ammonium additions led to co-dominance by Merismopedia and a dinoflagellate. In mesotrophic, alkaline Lake Erken ammonium in combination with phosphate stimulated the growth of non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (Microcystis spp. and Synechococcus sp.), whereas nitrate additions produced no such outcome. Measurements of nitrate reductase activity in enclosure waters containing nitrate and phosphate indicated that eukaryotic nitrate reductase activity (NADH-NR) was induced more rapidly and to a greater extent than the prokaryotic (cyanobacterial) nitrate reductase activity (MV-NR). It is argued that dominance by cyanobacteria is attributable to the following factors: ability to minimize sedimentation and grazing losses in combination with i) the ability to fix molecular nitrogen (nitrogen-fixing species) in nitrogen deficient systems or ii) the ability to out-compete most other phytoplankton for ammonium-nitrogen (non-nitrogen-fixing species) in nitrate depleted systems.

J	ROSE, GA				ROSE, GA			GROWTH DECLINE IN SUBYEARLING BROOK TROUT (SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS) AFTER EMERGENCE OF RAINBOW-TROUT (SALMO-GAIRDNERI)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In a tributary of Lake Superior [USA, Canada], brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) subyearlings, after emergence in April, initially gained length at 0.51 mm/d and weight at a specific growth rate per day (G) of 0.058. After the emergence of larval rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in June, however, length increments of brook trout declined to 0.05 mm/d and G was reduced to 0.005. During August, brook trout growth rebounded somewhat (0.12 mm/d; G = 0.008). Rainbow trout subyearlings, by contrast, grew at relatively constant rates of 0.42 mm/d and G of 0.040, from emergence until September. By late August, mean weights of brook and rainbow trout, 2026 and 2282 mg, respectively, did not differ significantly. Stream positions occupied by brook trout, characterized by flows of less than 20 cm/s and depths of less than 40 cm, did not change over the first summer. During June and July, stream positions of rainbow trout subyearlings coincided with those of brook trout. During August, however, rainbow trout moved to faster waters (> 20 cm/s). The taxonomic composition of the diets of the two species did not differ. Mean width of food items consumed was linearly correlated with the total length of the fish (r = 0.97). The range of sizes of items eaten by the two species overlapped considerably by mid-June. For brook trout, mean food size increased, and amount consumed decreased, after the emergence of rainbow trout larvae. Growth reduction during first summer, an outcome of interspecific competition for food and spance, may result in increased overwintering mortality of fish at high latitudes, and be a mechanism by which brook trout are excluded by rainbow trout.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1986	43	1					187	193		10.1139/f86-021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-021													WOS:A1986AYV4700021

Oxygen dynamics control the burial of organic carbon in a eutrophic reservoir	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Organic carbon (OC) mineralization in freshwaters is dependent on oxygen availability near the sediments, which controls whether OC inputs will be buried or respired. However, oxygen dynamics in waterbodies are changing globally due to land use and climate, and the consequences of variable oxygen conditions for OC burial are unknown. We manipulated hypolimnetic oxygen availability in a whole-reservoir experiment and used a mass balance OC model to quantify rates of OC burial. Throughout summer stratification, we observed that OC burial rates were tightly coupled to sediment oxygen concentrations: oxic conditions promoted the mineralization of "legacy" OC that had accumulated over years of sedimentation, resulting in negative OC burial. Moreover, our study demonstrates that fluctuating oxygen conditions can switch ecosystem-scale OC burial in a reservoir between positive and negative rates. Consequently, changing oxygen availability in freshwaters globally will likely have large implications for the role of these ecosystems as OC sinks.

The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations increased from 3.6 mg/L to 7.1 mg/L in the 15 muE/m(2) per s irradiance treatment, while in the dark control the DO concentrations decreased to 1.1 mg/L in June. Along with the oxygen increase, chlorophyll a concentration increased from 0.24 mug/L to 1.35 mug/L while inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus decreased. These results indicate that low-intensity light is effective in stimulating photosynthesis of coastal bottom water and for net production of DO, especially in summer. It is a promising way to improve the anoxic bottom environment.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				JUN	2004	70	3					421	429		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2004.00821.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2004.00821.x													WOS:000222742800009

We analysed 41 years of data (19682008) from Blelham Tarn, U.K., to determine the consequences of eutrophication and climate warming on hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO). 2. The establishment of thermal stratification was strongly related to the onset of DO depletion in the lower hypolimnion. As a result of a progressively earlier onset of stratification and later overturn, the duration of stratification increased by 38 +/- 8 days over the 41 years. 3. The observed rate of volumetric hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (VHODobs) ranged from 0.131 to 0.252 g O2 m) 3 per day and decreased significantly over the study period, despite the increase in the mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in the growing season. The vertical transport of DO represented from 0 to 30% of VHODobs, while adjustments for interannual differences in hypolimnetic temperature were less important, ranging from) 11 to 9% of VHODobs. 4. The mean wind speed during May made the strongest significant contribution to the variation in VHODobs. VHODobs adjusted for the vertical transport of DO and hypolimnetic temperature differences, VHODadj, was significantly related to the upper mixed layer Chl a concentration during spring. 5. Hypolimnetic anoxia (HA) ranged from 27 to 168 days per year and increased significantly over time, which undoubtedly had negative ecological consequences for the lake. 6. In similar small temperate lakes, the negative effects of eutrophication on hypolimnetic DO are likely to be exacerbated by changes in lake thermal structure brought about by a warming climate, which may undermine management efforts to alleviate the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication.

To measure how and the extent to which a trunk river can influence its tributary lakes, we made a case study in Changjiang River and one of its tributary lakes, Lake East Dongting (Lake ED) during a 35-year study period (1980-2014). Specifically, we investigated Lake ED's discharge ability into Changjiang River using stage-discharge relationship curves, and hence the changes of the lake discharge ability under different hydrologic conditions of the Changjiang River. The results show that (1) the Changjiang River does exert a huge impact on the water regimes of Lake ED. And this impact varies seasonally. A variation of 3000 m(3)/s in Changjiang River's runoff would change the lake water level by about 1.1 m in dry seasons, by 0.4 m in wet seasons, and by 0.6 m during severe summer floods. (2) Changes in the Changjiang River runoff triggered by the Three Gorges Dam since 2003 have led to dramatic water regime variations in Lake ED. Other factors, including reduction of lake inflow and the lake bed erosion, also exacerbated the water regime variations in Lake ED.					dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024; Li, YanY/ABC-3649-2020														1009-637X	1861-9568				AUG	2018	28	8					1072	1084		10.1007/s11442-018-1542-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-018-1542-5													WOS:000440115800003

Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) emanations from Lake Natron's saline mudflats	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												In a recent global analysis of satellite-derived atmospheric NH3 data, a hotspot was observed in the vicinity of Lake Natron, Tanzania. The lake is in the centre of an endorheic (limited drainage) basin and has shallow, saline-alkaline waters. Its remote location and the absence of nearby large anthropogenic sources suggest that the observed NH3 is mainly of natural origin. Here we explore 10 years of IASI NH3 satellite data and other publicly available datasets over the area to characterize the natural NH3 emissions in this unique ecosystem. Temporal analysis reveals that the emissions are episodic and linked with the lake's surface area. The largest NH3 column loadings generally occur at the end of the dry season in September-November over Lake Natron's largest mudflat, that is exposed with receding water levels. The timing is different from the agricultural dominated NH3 emissions in the wider Natron area, which peak early in the year, after the first wet season. The likely source of NH3 at Lake Natron is decomposition of organic material, either from rivers and springs or produced in the lake (plankton, bird excreta). High temperatures and alkalinity are known to promote NH3 losses from soda lakes. We formulate six processes that may explain why the largest losses are observed specifically over concentrated brines and/ or exposed sediments. As a by-product, we also show that hyperspectral infrared sounders such as IASI are capable of mapping different types of evaporative minerals such as trona and thermonatrite.

Modelling the Early Weichselian Eurasian Ice Sheets: role of ice shelves and influence of ice-dammed lakes	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												During the last glaciation, a marine ice sheet repeatedly appeared in Eurasia. The floating part of this ice sheet was essential to its rapid extension over the seas. During the earliest stage (90 kyr BP), large ice-dammed lakes formed south of the ice sheet. These lakes are believed to have cooled the climate at the margin of the ice. Using an ice sheet model, we investigated the role of ice shelves during the inception and the influence of ice-dammed lakes on the ice sheet evolution. Inception in Barents sea seems due to thickening of a large ice shelf. We observe a substantial impact of the lakes on the evolution of the ice sheets. Reduced summer ablation enhances ice extent and thickness, and the deglaciation is delayed by 2000 years.					; Vaughan, David/C-8348-2011; Krinner, Gerhard/A-6450-2011	Ritz, Catherine/0000-0003-0785-8571; Krinner, Gerhard/0000-0002-2959-5920; Peyaud, Vincent/0000-0001-5583-4086; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2007	3	3					375	386		10.5194/cp-3-375-2007	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-3-375-2007													WOS:000249785600002

Regional climatic drivers of synchronous zooplankton dynamics in north-temperate lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The role that climate plays in determining the temporal dynamics of freshwater zooplankton is poorly understood, despite its potential to synchronize population dynamics on a regional basis. We quantify the spatial synchrony of common zooplankton taxa among lakes in the Dorset, Ontario, area and investigate the climatic mechanisms responsible for these patterns at both annual and seasonal scales. We show that the dynamics of several taxa are characterized by similar patterns of abundance among lakes across the region, suggesting a synchronising effect of climate on zooplankton population abundances. Using multiple regression analyses to compare zooplankton dynamics with climatic and in- lake variables, we find that El Ni (n) over tildeo - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO) events and ice cover variability are among the most important predictors of synchrony at annual and seasonal scales, particularly for Leptodiaptomus and Bosmina. Leptodiaptomus, a dominant herbivore in these lakes, had decreased abundances in years with earlier ice- off dates and shorter periods of ice cover. Secchi depth was also synchronous and appeared to respond to regional meteorological factors ( spring temperature and precipitation, ice duration). A warming climate with the ability to modify ice and ENSO dynamics, as well as temperature and precipitation patterns, may also alter the structure and dynamics of zooplankton communities in north- temperate lakes.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013; Reagan/ABE-6875-2020	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; 													0706-652X					MAY	2008	65	5					878	889		10.1139/F08-043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F08-043													WOS:000255671700009

The concentrations of nitrate SRSi had often a decline phase with about constant decline rate. The mean decline rate seemed to increase with increasing mean concentration of total phosphorus (TP). The possibility of Si- and N-limiting growth was higher in eutrophic than in oligo- and mesotrophic lakes, which may partly explain the higher dominance of Oscillatoria compared with the diatoms in many eutrophic lakes. In the lakes studied the mean concentration oF TP and the spring concentrations of SRSi and nitriate may be used to determine roughly when Si- and N-limiting growth may take place respectively. If the concentrations of SRSi or nitrate are high at the beginning of the growth season and the mean concentration of TP is low, Si- or N-limiting growth may not take place. The SRSi:NO3 decline ratio often varied between 2 and 8 and Si was always the first of these two nutrients to become growth-limiting.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 28	1990	196	3					255	263		10.1007/BF00006137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006137													WOS:A1990DL03400007

WATER												Despite various water protection measures, good water quality and reduction of nutrient loads seem very distant goals, largely due to limited knowledge of processes occurring in river valleys. Our study aimed at establishing the role of small floodplain reservoirs in the eutrophication processes, in the face of recent climate changes. The content of phosphorus and nitrogen compounds was determined in sediments and water of small floodplain reservoirs, (the Vistula River Valley, Poland) using spectrophotometric and Kjeldahl's method. Nutrient loads in sediments were linked to the texture and total organic carbon content. Seasonal changes in water quality were strictly connected to changing weather conditions, flood and drought. The concentrations of PO43- and NO3- were found to rise after summer flooding. Increases in NH4+, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were correlated with the surface water area reduction in the reservoirs, which during the year of the study was on average 62%. Therefore, small floodplain reservoirs could be considered simultaneously as sinks and sources of nutrients. On the one hand, they accumulate P and N compounds carried by the river during the flood. On the other hand, climate change cause that small floodplain reservoirs may be responsible for enhanced biomass production.

In a saline lake in south eastern Italy, populations of the two species were observed for two years. A. parthenogenetica was typical of the early wet season (October-January), while B. spinosa, even if it was present before, developed in the late part of the wet season (February-May). Adult A. parthenogenetica were recorded only in the season 1999-2000. The seasonal distribution of A. parthenogenetica is probably controlled by abiotic conditions (i.e., photoperiod, temperature, conductivity, and rainfall); however, competition between specimens of similar body size (e.g., adults of A. parthenogenetica, and juveniles of B. spinosa) could explain the lower numbers of B. spinosa population in winter. The discovery of cysts of both species deep in the sediment of the lake suggests a long-lasting co-occurrence of these two Anostraca.

J	Hamzehpour, N; Bogaert, P				Hamzehpour, Nikou; Bogaert, Patrick			Improved spatiotemporal monitoring of soil salinity using filtered kriging with measurement errors: An application to the West Urmia Lake, Iran	GEODERMA												Real-time monitoring of soil salinity based on field samples and laboratory analyses is a costly and time demanding procedure, so that sound methods that could reduce the burden by making use of cheaper data would be a step toward a more sustainable salinity hazards monitoring system on the long run. Typically, this involves replacing presumably error-free laboratory salinity measurements with indirect measurements that are however affected by various source of uncertainties, and these uncertainties need to be accounted for in order to avoid compromising the quality of the final results. More specifically, in a spatiotemporal prediction framework where salinity maps need to be drawn repeatedly at various time instants and where salinity, values need to be compared over time for agricultural areas that are prone to salinity hazards, it is of major importance to process these uncertainties in a sound way, as failing to do so would impair our ability to detect salinity changes at an early stage for taking preventive actions. The aim of this paper is to propose a filtered kriging framework that allows the user to rely on cheap field sampled electrical conductivity (EC) measurements, that cannot however be assumed as error-free. Field EC measurements need to be calibrated from laboratory measurements and the corresponding calibration errors cannot be neglected. Moreover, when sampling is repeated over time, positioning errors are quite common and can adversely impact the results due to the inclusion of an extra variability source. It is shown how these uncertainties can be quantified and successfully processed afterwards for improving both the reliability of the spatial predictions and temporal comparisons of soil salinity. The idea is to rely on a same general optimal linear predictor that can be easily adapted to get rid of these unwanted effects. The procedure is illustrated by using a rich data set of EC measurements that cover a time span of seven years in the western part of Urmia Lake, northwest Iran. From these data, it is shown how calibration errors can be considered as spatially independent and zero-mean Gaussian distributed, while laboratory measurements exhibit a clear spatial structure but are also affected by a not inconsiderable spatial nugget effect, which is in turn impacting the errors for field EC measurements due to the positioning errors. By relying on a linear optimal predictor that reduces here to filtered kriging with measurement errors, it is shown that filtering out these two random effect components clearly improves the quality of the results when it comes to map EC values and to detect changes that occurred over time. Comparing filtered values for the successive sampling campaigns provided evidence that a major salinity shift did occur between autumn 2011 and autumn 2014 while the other parts of the area were left unchanged by comparison. From this study, it can be concluded that even if the only errors involved in this work were linked to calibration and positioning errors, the methodology is general enough to process various sources of uncertainties in general. It is thus a valuable tool for practitioners, with a field of potential applications that goes beyond the framework of salinity monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Beyond the hockey stick: Climate lessons from the Common Era	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												More than two decades ago, my coauthors, Raymond Bradley and Malcolm Hughes, and I published the now iconic "hockey stick" curve. It was a simple graph, derived from large-scale networks of diverse climate proxy ("multiproxy") data such as tree rings, ice cores, corals, and lake sediments, that captured the unprecedented nature of the warming taking place today. It became a focal point in the debate over human-caused climate change and what to do about it. Yet, the apparent simplicity of the hockey stick curve betrays the dynamicism and complexity of the climate history of past centuries and how it can inform our understanding of humancaused climate change and its impacts. In this article, I discuss the lessons we can learn from studying paleoclimate records and climate model simulations of the "Common Era," the period of the past two millennia during which the "signal" of human-caused warming has risen dramatically from the background of natural variability.

Late Noachian Icy Highlands climate model: Exploring the possibility of transient melting and fluvial/lacustrine activity through peak annual and seasonal temperatures	ICARUS												The nature of the Late Noachian climate of Mars remains one of the outstanding questions in the study of the evolution of martian geology and climate. Despite abundant evidence for flowing water (valley networks and open/closed basin lakes), climate models have had difficulties reproducing mean annual surface temperatures (MAT) > 273 K in order to generate the "warm and wet" climate conditions presumed to be necessary to explain the observed fluvial and lacustrine features. Here, we consider a "cold and icy" climate scenario, characterized by MAT similar to 225 K and snow and ice distributed in the southern highlands, and ask: Does the formation of the fluvial and lacustrine features require continuous "warm and wet" conditions, or could seasonal temperature variation in a "cold and icy" climate produce sufficient summertime ice melting and surface runoff to account for the observed features? To address this question, we employ the 3D Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique global climate model (LMD GCM) for early Mars and (1) analyze peak annual temperature (PAT) maps to determine where on Mars temperatures exceed freezing in the summer season, (2) produce temperature time series at three valley network systems and compare the duration of the time during which temperatures exceed freezing with seasonal temperature variations in the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) where similar fluvial and lacustrine features are observed, and (3) perform a positive-degree-day analysis to determine the annual volume of meltwater produced through this mechanism, estimate the necessary duration that this process must repeat to produce sufficient meltwater for valley network formation, and estimate whether runoff rates predicted by this mechanism are comparable to those required to form the observed geomorphology of the valley networks. When considering an ambient CO2 atmosphere, characterized by MAT similar to 225 K, we find that: (1) PAT can exceed the melting point of water (>273 K) in topographic lows, such as the northern lowlands and basin floors, and small regions near the equator during peak summer season conditions, despite the much lower MAT; (2) Correlation of PAT > 273 K with the predicted distribution of surface snow and ice shows that melting could occur near the edges of the ice sheet in near-equatorial regions where valley networks are abundant; (3) For the case of a circular orbit, the duration of temperatures >273 K at specific valley network locations suggests that yearly meltwater generation is insufficient to carve the observed fluvial and lacustrine features when compared with the percentage of the year required to sustain similar features in the MDV; (4) For the case of a more eccentric orbit (eccentricity of 0.17), the duration of temperatures >273 K at specific valley network locations suggests that annual meltwater generation may be capable of producing sufficient meltwater for valley network formation when repeated for many years; (5) When considering a slightly warmer climate scenario and a circular orbit, characterized by MAT similar to 243 K, we find that this small amount of additional greenhouse warming (similar to 18K MAT increase) produces time durations of temperatures >273 K that are similar to those observed in the MDV. Thus, we suggest that peak daytime and seasonal temperatures exceeding similar to 273 K could form the valley networks and lakes with either a relatively high eccentricity condition or a small amount of additional atmospheric warming, rather than the need for a sustained MAT at or above 273 K. The results from our positive-degree-day analysis suggest that: (1) For the conditions of 25 obliquity, 600 mbar atmosphere, and eccentricity of 0.17, this seasonal melting process would be required to continue for similar to(33-1083) x 10(3) years to produce a sufficient volume of meltwater to form the valley networks and lakes; (2) similarly, for the conditions of 25 degrees obliquity, 1000 mbar atmosphere, circular orbit, and similar to 18 Kadditional greenhouse warming, the process would be required to continue for similar to(21-550) x 10(3) years. Therefore, peak seasonal melting of snow and ice could induce the generation of meltwater and fluvial and lacustrine activity in a "cold and icy" Late Noachian climate in a manner similar to that observed in the MDV. A potential shortcoming of this mechanism is that independent estimates of the required runoff rates for valley network formation are much higher than those predicted by this mechanism when considering a circular orbit, even when accounting for additional atmospheric warming. However, we consider that a relatively higher eccentricity condition (0.17) may produce the necessary runoff rates: for the perihelion scenario in which perihelion occurs during southern hemispheric summer, intense melting will occur in the near-equatorial regions and in the southern hemisphere, producing runoff rates comparable to those required for valley network formation (similar to mm/day). In the opposite perihelion scenario, the southern hemisphere will experience very little summertime melting. Thus, this seasonal melting mechanism is a strong candidate for formation of the valley networks when considering a relatively high eccentricity (0.17) because this mechanism is capable of (1) producing meltwater in the equatorial region where valley networks are abundant, (2) continuously producing seasonal meltwater for the estimated time duration of valley network formation, (3) yielding the amount of meltwater necessary to incise the valley networks within this time period, and (4) by considering a perihelion scenario in which half of the duration of valley network formation is spent with peak summertime conditions during perihelion in each hemisphere, higher runoff rates are produced than in a circular orbit and the rates may be comparable to those required for valley network formation.

A 900-year New England temperature reconstruction from in situ seasonally produced branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs)	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Paleotemperature reconstructions are essential for distinguishing anthropogenic climate change from natural variability. An emerging method in paleolimnology is the use of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in sediments to reconstruct temperature, but their application is hindered by a limited understanding of their sources, seasonal production, and transport. Here, we report seasonally resolved measurements of brGDGT production in the water column, in catchment soils, and in a sediment core from Basin Pond, a small, deep inland lake in Maine, USA. We find similar brGDGT distributions in both water column and lake sediment samples but the catchment soils have distinct brGDGT distributions suggesting that (1) brGDGTs are produced within the lake and (2) this in situ production dominates the down-core sedimentary signal. Seasonally, depth-resolved measurements indicate that most brGDGT production occurs in late fall, and at intermediate depths (18-30 m) in the water column. We utilize these observations to help interpret a Basin Pond brGDGT-based temperature reconstruction spanning the past 900 years. This record exhibits trends similar to a pollen record from the same site and also to regional and global syntheses of terrestrial temperatures over the last millennium. However, the Basin Pond temperature record shows higher-frequency variability than has previously been captured by such an archive in the northeastern United States, potentially attributed to the North Atlantic Oscillation and volcanic or solar activity. This first brGDGT-based multi-centennial paleoreconstruction from this region contributes to our understanding of the production and fate of brGDGTs in lacustrine systems.

The method improves on previous airglow techniques by employing direct characterization of the GW temperature perturbations averaged over the OH airglow layer and correlative wind and temperature measurements to define the intrinsic GW properties with high confidence. These methods are applied to two events, each of which involves superpositions of GWs having various scales and character. In each case, small-scale GWs were found to achieve transient, but very large, momentumfluxes with magnitudes varying from similar to 60 to 940m(2) s(-2), which are similar to 1-2 decades larger than mean values. Quantification of the spatial and temporal variations of GW amplitudes and pseudo-momentum fluxes may also enable assessments of the total pseudo-momentum accompanying individual GW packets and of the potential for secondary GW generation that arises from GW localization. We expect that the use of this method will yield key insights into the statistical forcing of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by GWs, the importance of infrequent large-amplitude events, and their effects on GW spectral evolution with altitude.					; Yuan, Tao/AAD-2816-2019; Pautet, Pierre-Dominique/HRC-1681-2023	Bossert, Katrina/0000-0002-7076-0449; Stober, Gunter/0000-0002-7909-6345; Yuan, Tao/0000-0003-3008-0171; Pautet, Pierre-Dominique/0000-0001-9452-7337													2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 27	2014	119	24					13583	13603		10.1002/2014JD022150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022150													WOS:000348460000001

Throughout the history of urban centers, a sufficient water supply has been the backbone of each city. All sources of water, rivers, lakes, springs, underground sources, and rainwater collection, were exploited for urban supply starting from the earliest civilizations. The specific choice was dependent upon the civilization, the geomorphology, the topography, and the local climatic and hydrological conditions. No large-scale lifting techniques were available; thus, water was transferred from the source by aqueducts from a higher altitude. Cisterns used for collection of rain water and wells for drawing groundwater were very well developed since the Bronze Age. During historical times, Greeks and later Romans reached a high level of water supply technologies that greatly influenced modern achievements in water engineering and management.

Glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are sources of water for most major Asian rivers, but their melting history remains unclear, preventing in-depth understanding of their mechanisms. Here, we propose the authigenic carbonate delta O-18 from glacial lakes as a quantitative proxy to estimate variations of glacier meltwater. In the Western Kunlun Mountain, 6 18 0 record at Guozha Co indicates that maximum glacier meltwater (-28.62 +/- 25.76 Gt) occurred at 9.5-8.5 ka BP, and minimum glacier meltwater (24.53 +/- 25.02 Gt) at 1.3-0.5 ka BP. Nearly 20% of regional glaciers melted from the Early to Late Holocene, likely controlled by the summer temperature and accumulation of melting potential estimated by positive degree-day. Based on the projected temperature, this study suggests the TP glaciers likely face severe threats at the current rates of global warming. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Less than 1% of the spawning run entered Taylor Creek before flow from Fallen Leaf Lake was increased on 2 October 1991; in 1992 the peak occurred on 30 September or 1 October after flows increased on 29 September. In both years spawners concentrated in the middle three of five stream reaches below the impassable Fallen Leaf Lake dam. From tag-and-recovery experiments, the average longevity of male spawners in the stream was 3.5 days in 1991 and 2.8 days in 1992, whereas the average female longevity was 2.0 days in 1991 and 2.3 days in 1992. Observed carcasses accounted for less than 10% of spawners counted, suggesting removal by scavengers or high predation on prespawners. An estimated 1928 males and 1309 females spawned in 1991, and 8021 males and 8712 females spawned in 1992. Our estimate of 3237 spawners in 1991 compared favorably to our estimate of 3520 +/- 1474 prespawners staging in Lake Tahoe in mid-September. An index of kokanee abundance in Lake Tahoe has historically been based on 1-day surveys every 1 November since 1960; however, estimated total spawner abundance was 19 times higher than the annual index of 158 spawners in 1991, and 141 times higher than the index count of 100 spawners in 1992. The index count and mean fork lengths of spawners (278 +/- 10 mm [2 SE] for males, and 248 +/- 3 mm for females) in 1991 and 1992 were the lowest on record.																			0017-3614					APR	1994	54	2					130	141																WOS:A1994NJ56100005

S.; Mueller, Daniel; Walter, Thomas R.; Winder, Tom; Rawlinson, Nicholas			Lava Lake Spattering Drives Seismic Tremor During the Geldingadalir 2021 Eruption, Iceland	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Volcanic eruptions generate a continuous ground motion that is commonly referred to as tremor. Although tremor is used worldwide for real-time monitoring of volcanoes, the mechanisms involved are generally poorly understood. Here, we study the episodic effusion during 2021 Geldingadalir eruption. We use photogrammetric data and videos acquired by drones hovering over the active lava lake on 8 June 2021, and compare them with volcanic tremor recorded by a seismometer at 1.8 km distance from the vent. This allows us to investigate the timing of tremor, eruption, and the rise and falls of the lava lake. We observe an episodic seismic tremor lasting about 5 min, followed by over 7-min-long repose times. A closer study of one effusion episode reveals that within these 12 min the lava lake rises and falls by 24.6 +/- $\pm $ 0.6 m. The rise time is about 10 min, while the lake level drops within 2 min, contrasting with the tremor observations. By combining tremor and video analysis, we show that the tremor amplitude is not related to the lake level, but peaks when the bubble bursting and spattering in the lava lake is at its maximum. We therefore suggest that the tremor is closely related to the bubble bursting activity and is thus indicative of near-surface processes during an eruption. This study provides insights into tremor generation associated with the Geldingadalir eruption, leading to a conceptual model to assess its implications for the characterization and interpretation of dynamic lava lake evolution.					; Eibl, Eva/HIR-7341-2022; Walter, Thomas/AAQ-7405-2021	Eibl, Eva/0000-0002-0667-0035; Winder, Tom/0000-0001-7047-8673; 														1525-2027				AUG 11	2025	26	8							e2024GC012084	10.1029/2024GC012084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GC012084													WOS:001547586000001

Motivated by finding effective and economically feasible measures for suppressing evaporation, we study the efficacy of self-assembling floating covers in suppressing evaporation under field conditions and potential ecological ramifications of the covers. We conducted a multi-season study with eight identical small reservoirs (13.5 m(2) area and 1.5 m deep) using ethylene-vinyl acetate foam disks (200 mm in diameter, 15 mm thick) in white and black to cover six reservoirs (cover fraction of 91%), leaving two uncovered reservoirs for control. Physical attributes such as evaporative losses, radiative balance, temperature, and heat fluxes were measured and compared with modeling results. Evaporation suppression under field conditions ranged between 65% and 80% in the summer. Despite significant differences in energy partitioning, evaporation from white and black disks were relatively similar (similar to 20% for white and similar to 30% evaporation for black disks compared to uncovered reservoir). Replacing black disks with water filled black polyethylene balls improved suppression efficiency and diminished seasonal variations (similar to 80% suppression irrespective of season). We developed a physically based model to describe and extend the experimental findings by exploring effects of reservoir management regimes on evaporation and to optimize cover and reservoir characteristics for different climatic conditions.					; Or, Dani/D-8768-2012; Lehmann, Peter/AGK-2787-2022	Mady, Bassem/0000-0002-1421-1197; Or, Dani/0000-0002-3236-2933; Lehmann, Peter/0000-0001-6315-7441													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2021	57	4							e2020WR028753	10.1029/2020WR028753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028753													WOS:000644063800056

Based on a monthly sampling at 11 stations in three regions of Hongze Lake, the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of cyanobacteria community was comprehensively investigated from March 2011 to February 2013. A total of 23 cyanobacterial species which belong to 16 genera were identified, and Microcystis was the most predominant cyanobacterial genus mainly composed of Microcystis wesenbergii in Hongze Lake. The cyanobacterial abundance ranged from 0 to 2.6 x 10(7) cells/L, and the average cyanobacteria abundance of Northern region was significantly higher than those of Western region and Eastern region in the 2-year study. The total cyanobacteria abundance and the Microcystis abundance both took on a similar seasonal regularity in the three regions. The results of correlation analysis indicated that Microcystis abundance was correlated with water temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD)(Mn), nitrate (NO3-N), and total nitrogen (TN)/total phosphorus (TP) mass ratio, among which water temperature had the highest correlation coefficient. In summer, cyanobacteria blooms may take place under suitable environmental conditions at some special areas in Hongze Lake, especially where the concurrence of slow water exchange and steady wind direction exists.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2014	186	10					6919	6933		10.1007/s10661-014-3899-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3899-y								25004855					WOS:000341497800069

Cryptic cycling by electroactive bacterioplankton in Trout Bog Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The potential for extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a prevailing genomic feature of humic lake bacterioplankton. However, there has been little evidence for the substantial ecological contribution predicted by genetics. We hypothesized that anoxygenic phototrophic electrotrophs and accompanying heterotrophic electrogens cycle dissolved organic matter (DOM) between oxidized and reduced states. We predicted that such bacterioplankton would exhibit diel-scale oscillations due to the light dependency of photosynthesis. Using Trout Bog Lake in Wisconsin, USA, as our model ecosystem, we profiled the water column with depth-discrete metagenomic, physiochemical, and electrochemical analyses. We observed variation in oxidation reduction potential (ORP) in response to sunlight, initiating at depths populated by anoxygenic phototrophs with EET genes. We developed an automated buoy to measure electric current flow between many pairs of electrodes simultaneously, observing correlation in electron consumption to sunlight. Our results, combined with published metatranscriptomic analysis, indicate the occurrence of electron cycling between phototrophic oxidation (electrotrophic metabolism) by Chlorobium and anaerobic respiration (electrogenic metabolism) by Geothrix, involving DOM. We also repeatedly observed gradual seasonal increases in hypolimnion ORP throughout summer. These diel and seasonal patterns imply that electroactive DOM mediates the ecology of electroactive bacteria in lakes, controlling humic lake methane emissions.IMPORTANCEWe investigated the physical, chemical, and redox characteristics of a bog lake and electrodes hung therein to test the hypothesis that dissolved organic matter is being cycled between oxidized and reduced states by electroactive bacterioplankton powered by phototrophy. To do so, we performed field-based analyses on multiple timescales using both established and novel instrumentation. We paired these analyses with recently developed bioinformatics pipelines for metagenomics data to investigate genes that enable electroactive metabolism and accompanying metabolisms. Our results are consistent with our hypothesis and yet upend some of our other expectations. Our findings have implications for understanding greenhouse gas emissions from lakes, including electroactivity as an integral part of lake metabolism throughout more of the anoxic parts of lakes and for a longer portion of the summer than expected. Our results also give a sense of what electroactivity occurs at given depths and provide a strong basis for future studies.

J	Butler, DR				Butler, David R.			Characteristics of beaver ponds on deltas in a mountain environment	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Many beaver ponds in the Rocky Mountains, that have been described in the literature, are in-channel ponds that are relatively small and short-lived. This paper describes floodplain beaver ponds on low-gradient deltas in glacial finger lakes in Glacier National Park, Montana. These ponds are distinctly larger, probably fed by hyporheic flow, and stable and long-lived. Ponds examined were, with one exception, 44 years old. Glacial discharge is present in each valley where beaver ponds occupy low-gradient deltas, and this discharge likely sustains pond water level over the course of the summer. As glaciers recede and disappear, deltaic beaver ponds dependent on hyporheic flow may be negatively affected. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

With view to resolving this problem, the sampling of the lake and recording of measurements, coordinated by the National Office of Forest, shows the diffusion process of NaCl : the rate is determined by hydrolimatic an hydrologic conditions of site. Analysis of the amounts of the NaCl and of the conductivity of take's water shows a series of peak values rising to 145 mg/l, related to different seasons and change in the weather Variations are also due to hydrological characteristics of both natural and man-made (road) features of the catchment a a.

However, the impacts of these two factors on waterbird populations at three biological levels (i.e., the species, foraging guild, and community levels) remain poorly understood. Using multi-source remote sensing data and annual winter waterbird survey data (2013-2018), combined with statistical methods such as one-way ANOVA, generalized linear models, and redundancy analysis, we investigated landscape patterns influencing waterbird populations at three biological levels under human disturbance. Results indicated that most waterbird populations, excluding those specializing in invertebrate consumption, thrived greatly under low human disturbance intensity. Wetland vegetation and water connectivity played the most significant role among landscape metrics in shaping waterbird populations at three biological levels. The expanded wetland vegetation coverage strongly promoted waterbird populations, especially under low human disturbance intensity. Expanding main lakes with high water connectivity tended to suppress waterbird populations, while the newly formed shallow sub-lakes with limited connectivity promoted them. The role of water connectivity showed complexity across different intensities of human disturbance. Additionally, larger cropland patches benefited tuber- and seed-eating birds under low-moderate human disturbance, whereas built-up expansion harmed the waterbird community in highly disturbed areas. These findings offer useful insights for conserving overwintering waterbird populations and informing habitat management strategies in floodplain wetlands.

Royer, Todd; Bolster, Diogo			A watershed model predicts the effects of cover crops on river flows, sediment transport, and nutrient loss to Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recent investigations highlight the imperative of diminishing nonpoint nutrient loading to mitigate the prevalence of harmful algal blooms and hypoxic conditions in the Great Lakes region. This study employs the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance in simulating hydrology, sediment, and nutrient dynamics at the St. Joseph River Basin (SJRB). We used the SWAT model to evaluate the effectiveness of the planting of winter cover crops (WCC) on the magnitude and dynamics of dissolved nutrient and sediment export within the basin. We modeled different WCC scenarios by varying the fraction of the row-crop land to which WCC were planted during the fallow period. We show that although WCC have a minimal effect on streamflow, they substantially reduce total suspended solids (TSS) losses by up to 30 %, demonstrating their efficacy in soil erosion control. In contrast, there were variable effects of WCC on reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and nitrate-N (NO3-N) losses, with a higher effect on NO3-N losses than on DRP, resulting in up to a 4 % reduction in DRP and 12 % reduction in NO3-N losses. This study underscores the versatility of the SWAT model in assessing watershed flow and nutrient and sediment dynamics, offering valuable insights into the quantification and intercomparison of conservation and management interventions that improve water quality in agricultural watersheds in the Great Lakes region.					; Bolster, Diogo/D-9667-2011	Aboelnour, Mohamed/0000-0003-2441-1149; Bolster, Diogo/0000-0003-3960-4090													0380-1330					APR	2025	51	2							102528	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102528		MAR 2025											WOS:001449951400001

However, vegetation evolution in response to regional climatic trends and events during this interval remains controversial. Here, we present well-dated decadal-resolution loss on ignition (LOI) and grain size records from the Xing Co Lake on the eastern QTP. The records show an overall drying trend since 10 thousand years ago (ka), with multiple extreme precipitation events observed during 10 to 7 ka. An extreme drought event occurred at around 5.5 ka, after which the climate was drier and unstable with several drought events. In comparison with the hydroclimate, insolation, and El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation records, our data show a close correspondence with the summer insolation differential between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S and El Ni & ntilde;o events on orbital-millennium timescales. This suggested that the increased rainfall during the early Holocene on the eastern QTP can be attributed to the high insolation differential between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S and low El Ni & ntilde;o events. Conversely, the drying trend in the late Holocene appears to correlate with a low insolation differential and high El Ni & ntilde;o events. Whenever ice-rafted debris events occurred in the North Atlantic, there was a corresponding occurrence of drying events in the late Holocene in the Zoige Basin. This suggested that teleconnection between the precipitation on the eastern QTP and the North Atlantic climate exists in the Holocene. When compared to independent hydroclimatic and arboreal pollen (AP%) records on the eastern QTP, the evolutionary trends and events of AP% align closely with local hydroclimate changes. This suggested that arboreal coverage could rapidly respond to climate change during the Holocene, but further studies are needed.

J	Maeno, F; Taniguchi, H				Maeno, F.; Taniguchi, H.			Spatiotemporal evolution of a marine caldera-forming eruption, generating a low-aspect ratio pyroclastic flow, 7.3 ka, Kikai caldera, Japan: Implication from near-vent eruptive deposits	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The VEI 7, 7.3 ka caldera-forming eruption of the Kikai caldera occurred in a shallow sea, and caused devastating damage to the prehistoric human settlements of southern Kyushu, Japan. This Holocene activity at this volcano records eruptions with compositional range of 56 to 74 wt.% in SiO2 spanning with the climactic eruption. In this study, stratigraphy, component, and lithology of the pyroclastic deposits were analyzed at near-vent islands (Satsuma Iwo-jima and Take-shima) in order to reconstruct this eruption. Stratigraphic sections are characterized by plinian pumice-fall deposits (Unit A), intraplinian flow deposits (Unit B), climactic pyroclastic flow deposits (Units C1-C3), and co-ignimbrite ash-fall deposits (Unit D). In total the estimated magma volume in the system was 70-80 km(3) (DRE) and the eruption therefore represents the evacuation of a major silicic magmatic system. The plinian stage (Phase 1) is subdivided into an initial small phase and a second large one. The column height in the second phase was estimated to be 40-43 km. The total tephra volume of this stage was estimated to be 40 km(3). The magma discharge rate has been calculated from the column height data to be 2 x 10(8) kg/s. The eruption duration is also estimated to be a minimum of approximately 28 It. Collapse of the column (Phase 2) produced Unit B, which consists of multiple thin lithic-rich or pumice-rich layers or pods, including welded pumice-fall layers. The deposits are characterized by stratified or cross-stratified facies and display various degree of welding. These sedimentary characteristics indicate that, during the plinian column collapse, high temperature turbulent density currents were generated where dense pyroclasts were well segregated, resulting in the lithic-rich layers or pods. Phase 3 is characterized by Units C1-C3. Unit C1 shows non-welded stratified facies, which consist of lithic and crystals, including quenched juvenile materials as a minor constituent. Unit C2 displays welded stratified facies, which consist of lithic-rich layers and pumice-rich layers. These two subunits occur only in topographic lows in Satsuma Iwo-jima. Unit C3 is thickest and poorly-sorted non-welded massive deposit, which includes fragments of welded tuff from underlying units in proximal regions. These facts indicate that multiple pyroclastic density currents produced Units C1 and C2 in the near-vent area, and were followed by the main sustained current producing Unit C3, a tow-aspect ratio ignimbrite, distributed over a wide area of southern Kyushu across the sea. Varying extents of magma-water interactions started during Phase 2, continuing during the early stages of Phase 3, and diminished during the climactic C3 ignimbrite stage. In addition, collapse of the caldera may have started before Unit C deposition, based on the evidence of a fault overlain by Unit C on the caldera rim. The collapse may have initiated water access to the magma. The source appears to have been biased toward the western side of the caldera. The Holocene evolution of the Kikai volcano records the existence of a large silicic magma system at depths of about 7 kin that coexisted with or was regularly recharged with mafic magma.

J	Pazdur, A; Goslar, T; Pawlyta, M; Hercman, H; Gradzinski, M				Pazdur, A; Goslar, T; Pawlyta, M; Hercman, H; Gradzinski, M			Variations of isotopic composition of carbon in the karst environment from Southern Poland, present and past	RADIOCARBON												We describe a comprehensive study of carbon isotopes in several karst springs and their environs in a contemporary karst environment in the region of the Cracow-Wielun Upland and Western Tatra Mountains, Southern Poland. We collected samples of water, plants and carbonate deposited on aquatic plants, and obtained C-13 values and C-14 concentrations. We also investigated a group of the youngest calcium carbonates from caves where deposition is still being observed or ceased no more than a few hundred years ago. The determination of a C-14 dilution factor (q) in these carbonates allows us to determine the "true" radiocarbon ages of old speleothems from caves in the area under investigation and enables the use of old speleothems as suitable material for extending the C-14 calibration time scale, the "Absolute" age having been determined by U/Th or amino acid racemization (AAR) dating methods. Measurements of delta(13)C and C-14 concentrations were made on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) extracted from water samples. Calculated values of q range from 0.55 to 0.68 and delta(13)C values range from -10 parts per thousand to -13 parts per thousand versus VPDB with mean values equal to 0.65 and -12 parts per thousand, respectively. results indicate that the dissolution process of limestone bedrock is a closed system with the dominating contributor being biogenic carbon dioxide. Isotopic composition of carbon in contemporary plants collected at the karstic springs at 3 localities is highly diverse, with different species distinctly varying in both q and delta(13)C values. Extremely light values of C-13 (under -40 parts per thousand), observed in Algae and Hyloconium splendens, are correlated with C-14 concentrations that are much Bower than 100 pMC. Small systematic changes of isotopic composition were found in plants of the same species collected along streams at various distances from the spring. The youngest calcium carbonates from different caves show a relatively high scatter of both delta(13)C values and C-14 concentration. The lower reservoir effect for C-14 is observed in samples with higher value of delta(13)C, indicating equilibrium conditions in the sedimentation of carbonate. Pazdur et al. (1995b) presented C-14 dating results and paleoclimatic interpretation of 170 C-14 analyses of 89 speleothems from 41 caves obtained through 1994. Investigations continued until early 1997, during which time a speleothem, JWi2, was dated by C-14, U/Th and AAR dating methods, and its stable isotope composition (delta(13)C and delta(18)O) analyzed in detail (reported here). Carbon isotope analyses indicate very large differences among results obtained by U/Th, AAR, and C-14 dating methods.

J	Brantingham, PJ; Xing, G				Brantingham, P. Jeffrey; Xing, Gao			Peopling of the northern Tibetan Plateau	WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY												Early archaeological investigations on the Tibetan Plateau concluded that this harsh, high-elevation environment was successfully colonized around 30,000 years ago. Genetic studies have tended to support this view on the assumption that the uniquely evolved physiological capacities seen among, modern Tibetan populations required long-term exposure to high-elevation selective pressures. Archaeological evidence amassed over the last decade suggests, however, that colonization leading to full-time occupation occurred much later. Seasonal foraging forays into high-elevation settings at c. 30 and 15 cal. ka appear to have been limited 'adaptive radiations' coincident, respectively, with the appearance of early and late Upper Palaeolithic adaptations in low-elevation source areas around the plateau. More permanent occupation of the plateau probably did not begin before c. 8200 cal. BP and may have been driven by 'competitive exclusion' of late Upper Palaeolithic foragers from low-elevation environments by emerging settled agricultural groups. The appearance of specialized epi-Palaeolithic blade and bladelet technologies on the high plateau, after 8200 cal. ka, may indicate 'directional selection' impacting on these new full-time residents. An 'adaptive radiation' of agriculturalists into the mid-elevations of the plateau, this time leading to year-round occupation, is again seen after 6000 cal.

Thus, this study investigated the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in Belgrade, Serbia. Enterococcus species collected from ten surface water sites, including a lake, two major river systems, and springs, were tested. Among enterococci, we found single (21.7 %), double (17.4 %), and multiple antibiotic resistance patterns (56.3 %). Vancomycin-resistant strains were not found, indicating that their abundance in Belgrade is tightly linked to clinical settings. The multiple drug-resistant strains Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus mundtii were frequently detected in the lake during the swimming season and in the rivers near industrial zones. We confirmed the presence of ermB, ermC, ant(6)-Ia, tetM, and tetL and mutations in gyrA genes. The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene of E. faecium isolates that harbor esp gene classified them into two groups based on high-bootstraps scores in the tree analysis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of antibiotic-resistant enterococci revealed genomic similarity ranging from 75 to 100 %.

J	Bernal, NF; Gleeson, SA; Dean, AS; Liu, XM; Hoskin, P				Bernal, Nelson F.; Gleeson, Sarah A.; Dean, Abbie S.; Liu, Xiao-Ming; Hoskin, Paul			The source of halogens in geothermal fluids from the Taupo Volcanic Zone, North Island, New Zealand	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Forty-seven samples of deep geothermal well fluids and hot springs from 14 geothermal sites in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), North Island, New Zealand, were analyzed for Cl, Br and Li concentrations and delta Cl-37, delta Li-7, delta O-18 and delta D values. The main purpose of this study was to identify the sources of salinity in the TVZ fluids and to assess the processes that control stable chlorine isotopic fractionation in the geothermal waters. The samples were obtained from deep wells in the Mokai, Ohaaki, Wairakei, Rotokawa, Kawerau, Ngatamariki and Tauhara geothermal fields and from the hot springs at Rotorua, Waiotapu, Lake Taupo, Waimangu, Waikite, Orakei Korako and Tokaanu. Two main meteoric recharge areas were identified in the central TVZ, one located to the NE with delta O-18 and delta D values of -5.5 parts per thousand and -35 parts per thousand, respectively and the other to the SW with a delta O-18 value of -6.7 parts per thousand and delta D value of -43 parts per thousand. Water rock interactions in most of the geothermal fluids resulted in a delta O-18 shift to more positive values; up to 1 parts per thousand for Mokai and over 3 parts per thousand for Kawerau. The delta Li-7 values range from -2.9 parts per thousand to 2.0 parts per thousand and suggest that the deep geothermal fluids have interacted with rocks with low delta Li-7 values. The highest delta Li-7 values (1.4 parts per thousand) in the reservoir fluids were found at Kawerau where the low quartz content of the greywacke may result in the depletion of Li-6. The delta Cl-37 values of the samples ranged from -1.0 parts per thousand to 0.8 parts per thousand. The delta Cl-37 values of 0.2 parts per thousand, 0.1 parts per thousand and 0.0 parts per thousand were measured in samples from Orakei Korako, Waiotapu and Waimangu respectively, and these are interpreted to have been affected by surface evaporation and distillation processes. Excluding these data, most waters with high Cl/Br ratios had positive delta Cl-37 values. The Cl/Br molar ratios in well samples ranged from 659 to 1664 and the delta Cl-37 values from -1.0 parts per thousand to 0.8 parts per thousand. The hot springs had Cl/Br molar ratios ranging from 858 to 1611 and delta Cl-37 values from -0.8 parts per thousand to 0.7 parts per thousand. Overall, the Cl/Br molar ratios of the fluids are comparable with published data on basaltic magmas, and these magmas are inferred to be the main source of halogens in the geothermal fluids. However, the geothermal fluids can be separated into two main groups: one associated with rhyolitic magmas characterized by positive delta Cl-37 values and high Cl/Br molar ratios, and other related to andesitic magmas with negative delta Cl-37 values and lower Cl/Br molar ratios. We suggest therefore, that the isotopic fractionation of the stable Cl isotopes is related to the difference in water contents of andesitic and rhyolitic magmas and that the fluid phase is enriched in Cl-37 during magmatic evolution.

After the heavy rainfall, our unplanned cities turn into almost a lake. The main reason for this is the increase in hard floors and the narrowing of the green areas where water can be discharged. Besides, strong winds can cause plant organs to fall off and spread to the environment. Therefore, they can create dangerous situations that can lead to loss of lives and damages on properties. In this study, the effects of the storm on street trees are discussed. Following the storm on July 24, 2018, in Aydinlikevler Neighborhood of Altindag District of Ankara Province, the status of trees in Cagdas Street, Arama Street, Arilik Street, Sehit Omer Halisdemir Boulevard and Cevreli Street were photographed, and species were determined. After the storm, it was observed that most of the large branches of the trees were broken and fell on the pavements and parked vehicles under them. The suitability of the tree species used in these avenues and the street, the extent to which pruning and maintenance operations were performed were investigated through similar studies in the literature. Local and foreign sources about street afforestation were reviewed. It has been seen that the trees are not maintained regularly, pruned correctly; therefore, they can be broken more quickly in harsh winds; because they cannot show homogeneous and intensive branch development. In addition, it was concluded that faulty decisions regarding species selection were made.

In autumn season of 2019 and 2020, MLE (6%) was foliar sprayed onto lettuce grown under glasshouse conditions. Vitamin C, total polyphenols, total chlorophyll content and nitrate accumulation in three lettuce cultivars (May King, Kobak, and Great Lakes) and some correlations among the bioactive compounds were assessed. The results in 2019 show that there was no significant differences in the total polyphenols (mg GAE 100 g(-1) FW) and vitamin C (mg 100 g(-1) FW) between treated and untreated plants, while in 2020 significantly higher vitamin C (mg 100 g(-1) FW) and total polyphenols (mg GAE 100 g(-1) FW) were recorded in the plants treated with 6% MLE. In contrast, in 2019 application of 6% MLE lowered nitrate content (mg kg(-1)) by 13% in May King, 23% in Kobak, and 44% in Great Lakes. Similarly, in the season of 2020 foliar application of 6% MLE reduced the leaf nitrate content by 16% in May King, 19% in Kobak, and 44% in Great Lakes. In the mean of varieties, the only significant difference in total polyphenol and vitamin C was in the Great Lakes variety grown in 2020 whereas no differences were found for the experiment of 2019. In the mean of years, the only statistical difference was recorded for the nitrate content in control of the Great Lakes variety by 44% lower nitrate in the treated plants with 6%MLE. Positive correlation was found between vitamin C and total polyphenol content, whereas nitrate had a negative regression slop to vitamin C and total polyphenol content in both experiments. The major total chlorophyll differences were found in the experiment of 2019, although no significant differences were found for the SPAD value of the experiment of 2020. In our 2 years study, there was a positive correlation between vitamin C and total polyphenol while negative correlation was found between vitamin C and total polyphenol to nitrate content in all the lettuce cultivars.

Water samples were collected from different locations of the reservoir in June, July and September of 2015 and in February 2016. Water samples were extracted with dichloromethane solvent and quantified using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses. The results showed that all pesticides were detected for all periods and include dichlorvos, trifluralin, diazinon, methyl parathion, fenitrothion, malathion, profenofos and ethion. The highest concentrations were found in the summer that is related to malathion (on average 0.78 mu g L-1). In midwinter, no pesticide residues were detected. The results showed that concentration of single and total pesticides for all stations were greater than the maximum contamination level of the European Economic Commission.

The microplankton community included oligotrich ciliates, but rotifers and zooplankton nauplii comprised greater than 90% of total estimated heterotrophic microplankton biomass. Dominant rotifer taxa included Keratella cochlearis, Kellicottia longispina, Polyarthra vulgaris, Conochilus unicornis and a Synchaeta sp. Microplankton biomass was lowest in highly oligotrophic Toolik Lake (< 5 mugC l-1 at the surface) and highest (up to 55 mugC l-1) in the most eutrophic lakes, experimentally fertilized lakes, and fertilized limnocorrals, consistent with bottom-up regulation of microplankton abundance.																			0018-8158					SEP 21	1992	240	1-3					133	141		10.1007/BF00013458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013458													WOS:A1992JQ94000013

Chaoborus spp. Transport CH4 from the Sediments to the Surface Waters of a Eutrophic Reservoir, But Their Contribution to Water Column CH4 Concentrations and Diffusive Efflux Is Minor	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Chaoborus spp. (midge larvae) live in the anoxic sediments and h-ypolimnia of freshwater lakes and reservoirs during the day and migrate to the surface waters at night to feed on plankton. It has recently been proposed that Chaoborus take up methane (CH4) from the sediments in their tracheal gas sacs, use this acquired buoyancy to ascend into the surface waters, and then release the CH4, thereby serving as a CH4 "pump" to the atmosphere. We tested this hypothesis using diel surveys and seasonal monitoring, as well as incubations of Chaoborus to measure CH, transport in their gas sacs at different depths and times in a eutrophic reservoir. We found that Chaoborus transported CH, from the hypolimnion to the lower epilimnion at dusk, but the overall rate of CH4 transport was minor, and incubations revealed substantial variability in CH4 transport over space and time. We calculated that Chaoborus transport similar to 0.1 mmol CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) to the epilimnion in our study reservoir, a very low proportion (<1%) of total CH4 diffusive flux during the summer stratified period. Our data further indicate that CH4 transport by Chaoborus is sensitive to water column mixing, Chaoborus density, and Chaoborus species identity.

J	Srinivasan, G; Nair, S				Srinivasan, G; Nair, S			Daily rainfall characteristics from a high density rain gauge network	CURRENT SCIENCE												Enhanced observational information on the spatial distribution of rainfall, at a finer resolution, is vital for evaluation of mesoscale models. The present study examines the daily rainfall data from a high-density mesoscale rain gauge network consisting of 25 stations within a hundred sq. kin. area, during the south west monsoon season (June-September) for the period 1996-2000. The rainfalls reported are from lake catchments along the Western Ghats, falling in the district of Raigad and other urban locations in and around Mumbai. Using this data-set, an attempt has been made to examine the spatial distribution of heavy rainfall events. Poor correlations between stations indicate that they cannot be pooled together during spatial averaging for representing rainfall over the area. Heavy rainfall events contributed largest rainfall amounts at the foothills of the ghats and the least for sites on the Western ghats at higher altitudes. The results suggest that different controls modulate the synoptic situations to produce a spectrum of spatial and temporal precipitation variability on local scales, which would require further observational and modeling efforts to understand and predict.																			0011-3891					MAR 25	2005	88	6					942	946																WOS:000228202500029

Insights on post-breeding movements from a northeastern population of Canada Warblers (Cardellina canadensis)	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												The study of migratory songbird transition periods, such as the post-breeding period, is complex because birds undertake different types of movements that vary in space and time. Nonetheless, it is important to understand the extent and duration of the territory and specific sites use to identify human activities likely to affect the species' survival. Individuals from different regional populations may exhibit specific movements during the various phases of their annual cycle, and therefore conservation actions must be adapted. We studied a population of Canada Warblers (Cardellina canadensis) from the Saguenay region of Quebec, Canada, in the northeastern part of the species' breeding range. We used a coordinated radio-telemetry network (Motus) to determine the residence time within the breeding territory, dates and times of departure, and early fall migration routes of 18 adult birds. We expected individuals to leave by mid-August and to migrate through the eastern flyway, along the Atlantic Coast. Six tracked individuals remained on their breeding territory until early September, corresponding to a residence time of approximately 90 days. These individuals left just after sunset on their day of departure. Twelve individuals departed earlier, and in the daytime, before the end of August; their earlier departure was likely for a purpose other than migration. Nine individuals were detected outside their breeding territory along the Atlantic migratory flyway: four migrated through the Great Lakes region, one in the Great Appalachian Valley, three along the Atlantic Coast or coastal plain, and one with an undetermined route. Our results suggest that adult Canada Warblers remain in the Saguenay region longer than expected, and that, although some individuals remain close to their breeding territory during the post-breeding period, others may use surrounding territories prior to initiating their fall migration. Our results will allow regional conservation managers to recommend that regional industry postpone the timing of certain activities that could negatively affect the species' survival. Our study highlights the importance of fine-scale studies focused on specific periods of migratory songbird annual cycles to fill important knowledge gaps for understanding of the ecology of their species.

Circumpolar Mapping of Ground-Fast Lake Ice	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Shallow lakes are common across the entire Arctic. They play an important role as methane sources and wildlife habitats, and they are also associated with thermokarst processes which are characteristic of permafrost environments. Many lakes freeze to the ground along their rims and often over the entire extent during winter time. Knowledge on the spatial patterns of ground-fast and floating ice is important as it relates to methane release, talik formation and hydrological processes, but no circumpolar account of this phenomenon is currently available. Previous studies have shown that ground-fast ice can easily be detected using C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter intensity data acquired from satellites. A major challenge is that backscatter intensity varies across the satellite scenes due to incidence angle effects. Circumpolar application therefore requires the inclusion of incidence angle dependencies into the detection algorithm. An approach using ENVISAT ASAR Wide Swath data (approximately 120 m spatial resolution) has therefore been developed supported by bathymetric measurements for lakes in Siberia. This approach was then further applied across the entire Arctic for late winter 2008. Ground-fast ice fraction has been derived for (1) two million lake objects larger than 0.025 km(2) (post-processed GlobeLand30), (2) a 50 x 50 km grid and (3) within certain zones relevant for climate studies (permafrost type, last glacial maximum, Yedoma). Especially lakes smaller than approximately 0.1 km(2) may freeze completely to the ground. The proportion of ground-fast ice increases with increasing soil organic carbon content in the proximity of the lakes. This underlines the importance of such lakes for emission studies and the need to map the occurrence of ground-fast lake ice. Clusters of variable fractions of ground-fast ice occur especially in Yedoma regions of Eastern Siberia and Alaska. This reflects the nature of thaw lake dynamics. Analyses of lake depth measurements from several sites suggest that the used method yields the potential to utilize ground-fast lake ice information over larger areas with respect to landscape development, but results need to be treated with care, specifically for larger lakes and along river courses.					; Bartsch, Annett/G-6332-2012; Dvornikov, Yury/J-5087-2016; Khomutov, Artem/M-6490-2017; Leibman, Marina/V-6577-2017	Pointner, Georg/0000-0003-2539-3827; Bartsch, Annett/0000-0002-3737-7931; Dvornikov, Yury/0000-0003-3491-4487; 														2296-6463				FEB 16	2017	5								12	10.3389/feart.2017.00012	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2017.00012													WOS:000393958300001

Juvenile growth rates on diets consisting of 100% Ankistrodesmus falcatus (a nutritious green alga) or 100% Microcystis aeruginosa (toxic) were compared for D. pulicaria clones isolated from lakes expected to have low and high levels of bloom-forming cyanobacteria during summer. Growth rates of clones isolated from high-nutrient lakes (range of total phosphorus, 31-235 mu g L-1) were higher, and showed less relative inhibition, on the cyanobacterial diet compared to clones isolated from low-nutrient lakes (range of total phosphorus, 9-13 mu g L-1). Our results suggest that D. pulicaria populations exposed to high cyanobacterial levels over long periods of time can adapt to being more tolerant of toxic cyanobacteria in the diet.

Predicted ultrafine particulate matter source contribution across the continental United States during summertime air pollution events	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The regional concentrations of airborne ultrafine particulate matter mass (D-p < 0.1 mu m; PM0.1) were predicted in 39 cities across the United States (US) during summertime air pollution episodes. Calculations were performed using a regional source-oriented chemical transport model with 4 km spatial resolution operating on the National Emissions Inventory created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Measured source profiles for particle size and composition between 0.01 and 10 mu m were used to translate PM total mass to PM0.1. Predicted PM0.1 concentrations exceeded 2 mu g m(-3) during summer pollution episodes in major urban regions across the US including Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Houston, Miami, and New York. PM0.1 spatial gradients were sharper than PM2.5 spatial gradients due to the dominance of primary aerosol in PM0.1. Artificial source tags were used to track contributions to primary PM0.1 and PM2.5 from 15 source categories. On-road gasoline and diesel vehicles made significant contributions to regional PM0.1 in all 39 cities even though peak contributions within 0.3 km of the roadway were not resolved by the 4 km grid cells. Cooking also made significant contributions to PM0.1 in all cities but biomass combustion was only important in locations impacted by summer wildfires. Aviation was a significant source of PM0.1 in cities that had airports within their urban footprints. Industrial sources, including cement manufacturing, process heating, steel foundries, and paper and pulp processing, impacted their immediate vicinity but did not significantly contribute to PM0.1 concentrations in any of the target 39 cities. Natural gas combustion made significant contributions to PM0.1 concentrations due to the widespread use of this fuel for electricity generation, industrial applications, residential use, and commercial use. The major sources of primary PM0.1 and PM2.5 were notably different in many cities. Future epidemiological studies may be able to differentiate PM0.1 and PM2.5 health effects by contrasting cities with different ratios of PM0.1 = PM2.5. In the current study, cities with higher PM0.1 = PM2.5 ratios (ratio greater than 0.10) include Houston, TX, Los Angeles, CA, Bakersfield, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Cleveland, OH. Cities with lower PM0.1 to PM2.5 ratios (ratio lower than 0.05) include Lake Charles, LA, Baton Rouge, LA, St. Louis, MO, Baltimore, MD, and Washington, D.C.

Response of river water chemistry to changing atmospheric environment and sulfur dynamics in a forested catchment in central Japan	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Reduction of atmospheric sulfur (S) deposition and recovery of terrestrial ecosystems from acidification are matters of concerns in Asia. The Lake Ijira catchment (IJR) is located in the downwind region of the Chukyo Industrial Area in central Japan and has historically experienced large-scale deposition of S and nitrogen (N) from the atmosphere. Long-term monitoring data on the river water (RW) chemistry since 1988 were assessed with intensive-survey datasets on the input-output material budgets and S isotopic analysis (S-34). Previous studies have suggested that IJR was acidified and N-saturated, which was triggered by climatic anomalies (cold summer and drought summer) in the mid-1990s. Analysis shows that with a decline in NO3- concentrations, RW pH recovered to its original level in the early 2000s. Reductions in atmospheric deposition, diminished effects of climatic anomalies, and forest management practices, have all contributed to RW chemistry recovery. Although the SO42- concentration in the RW has declined continuously after the peak in 1994, the mean SO42- output significantly exceeded the input; the 5-year means from 2010 to 2014 are 2.5kmol(c)ha(-1)year(-1) and 0.86kmol(c)ha(-1)year(-1), respectively. The mean S-34 values of SO42- in rainwater and soil solution at 20cm depth were 4.3 parts per thousand and 3.5 parts per thousand, respectively, and that in the RW was -13.2 parts per thousand. The contributions of groundwater S to the RW S were estimated to range from 75 to 91%. Geological S with significantly low S-34 values largely contributed to the discrepancy of the input-output budget, while atmospheric S appeared to accumulate in soil as organic S. The tree-ring S-34 profile recorded historical changes in the atmospheric inputs in the region. With recovery of the RW, the relative contribution of atmospheric S became smaller. However, most of the atmospheric S is still retained in soil. Over the last few decades, RW chemistry has sensitively responded to changes in the atmospheric environment, including the atmospheric deposition of S and N and climatic anomalies, and as future changes are likely, long-term monitoring is essential.					; Takahashi, Masamichi/B-6584-2009; Sase, Hiroyuki/AAS-2461-2021; Inoue, Takanobu/AGD-2838-2022; Matsuda, Kazuhide/C-2041-2013; Ishida, Takuya/AAG-5562-2019; Tayasu, Ichiro/A-9924-2009	Ishida, Takuya/0000-0003-3290-4840; Kaneko, Shinji/0000-0002-5933-5214; Sase, Hiroyuki/0000-0001-9129-4339; Tanikawa, Toko/0000-0002-6042-8071; Matsuda, Kazuhide/0000-0003-3663-6126; Tayasu, Ichiro/0000-0002-3006-7973; Takahashi, Masamichi/0000-0002-6109-0826; Morohashi, Masayuki/0009-0007-7788-6443													0168-2563	1573-515X				FEB	2019	142	3					357	374		10.1007/s10533-019-00540-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-019-00540-1													WOS:000458845600003

On sealing a lakebed: mass media and environmental democratisation in China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												This paper examines a transition of environmental governance in China that involves increased transparency and public participation. It pays close attention to the role of the mass media in this transformation. After briefly reviewing the history of environmental governance in China, the paper examines the particular transformations in the governance regime that are associated with the controversy over the sealing of the eastern lake in the Old Summer Palace, Beijing. The paper argues that the central government has increasingly enlisted the support of the public and the media in governing environmental matters and provides evidence that the traditional mass media and the Internet have become increasingly active in environmental debates in China.

A biased sex ratio towards females occurred only in the anadromous population. The first 2 or 3 years in the life cycle of anadromous charr is spent in the river, followed by an intermediate period of a year in the salt wedge area and then by a 2- or 3-mo. period in salt water before returning to the river. Bigger charr started upstream migration earlier in the season than smaller charr. Migration peaks in 1979 were synchronized with the new moon. Fish movements in the estuary were greater during spring tides than neap tides. Diel activity was highest in the day in the estuary; the inverse situation occurred in the river. From tag returns, anadromous brook charr had a strong homing tendency.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1982	60	12					3084	3091		10.1139/z82-392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z82-392													WOS:A1982QD95700012

The comparative characteristics of the chemical composition and water quality of flowing and drainless lakes are given, and the multiplicities of exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations of pollutants in the summer period of 2016-2020 are revealed. It is noted that flowing lakes with a swampy catchment area in the Ser-Bulak river valley are most susceptible to biogenic load.

The relative influence of land cover, hydrology, and in-stream processing on the composition of dissolved organic matter in boreal streams	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Low-order boreal streams are particularly sensitive interfaces where dissolved organic matter (DOM) is transported from soils to inland waters. Disentangling the relative influence of key environmental factors suspected to influence stream water DOM composition is highly relevant to predicting the reactivity and fate of terrestrial DOM entering inland waters. Here we examined changes to DOM composition using absorbance and fluorescence, from 17 boreal streams ranging from first to fourth orders, over 14 months, including the rarely studied winter season, and two snowmelt periods (n = 836). We also analyzed soil pore water samples from three forest soil lysimeters to a depth of 70 cm (n = 60). Of five identified fluorescing parallel factor analysis components, two (C4 and C5) expressed a clear mire wetland or forest signature, providing distinct molecular markers of dominant land cover. In fact, land cover alone explained 49% of the variability in DOM composition. In contrast, seasonal fluctuations in hydrology only contributed to minor shifts (8%) in the composition of stream water DOM, while in-stream transformations to DOM composition were undetectable. These findings suggest that low-order boreal streams act as a passive pipe, since in-stream processing of DOM is restricted by short water residence times (6 h to 2 days). In addition, we demonstrated the sensitivity of optical approaches to distinguish between key terrestrial sources of DOM in the boreal landscape. By distinguishing the proportional leverage of key environmental controls on headwater stream DOM composition, we are better equipped to predict where and when key DOM transformations occur in the aquatic conduit.

J	Nygaard, G				Nygaard, G			Temporal and spatial development of individual species of plankton algae from European lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The temporal and spatial developments of 15 phytoplankton species widely distributed in European and North American lakes, have been studied by informations in the literature and especially by their behaviour during a 5 years development in the Danish lake Grane Langso. The species were characterized by temporal differences in maximum abundance, the density at the maximum, the number of maxima per year, the length of the vegetative period and the constancy of the annual maximum based on long-term studies. In several cases the phytoplankton species can be characterized by one individual behaviour in one group of lakes, while the same species behaves differently in another group of lakes. The results suggest that several species include two or more types with different tolerances and environmental requirements. Most of the species included are Chrysophytes, mainly species of Uroglena and Dinobryon. A remarkable feature of Grane Langso's Chrysophytes is their predilection to accumulate in the bottom water during the summer. A similar behaviour was not demonstrated by Chrysophytes in other lakes.																			0018-8158					OCT 1	1996	332	2					71	91		10.1007/BF00016687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016687													WOS:A1996VR41100001
J	BAILEY, RO				BAILEY, RO			PROTEIN RESERVE DYNAMICS IN POSTBREEDING ADULT MALE REDHEADS	CONDOR												Labile protein reserve dynamics were studied in postbreeding adult male redheads (A. americana) at Lake Winnipegosis, Manitoba, [Canada] from 1974-1977. Changes in tissue masses were related to molt and behavioral activity. Total body protein fluctuated seasonally but tended to increase from breeding to late fall. Redheads did not increase foraging time to meet the nutritional demands of the simultaneous wing molt. Protein reserve index (PRI) increased from the late premolt period to the first half of the flightless phase each year. Losses in breast muscle from late premolt to early wing molt were not compensated by the increasing weight of leg muscles. Breast protein may have shifted to growing feathers or other concurrent tissue growth. Breast muscle gained weight over the latter half of the flightless phase in 1977. Changes in locomotor muscle size were related to overall PRI, foraging time and anticipated seasonal use rather than simply use-disuse phenomena. Non-breeding male redheads maintained significantly higher PRI from breeding to late molt and appeared to more easily meet seasonal protein requirements than birds which had bred previously.																				1938-5129					1985	87	1					23	32		10.2307/1367126	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1367126													WOS:A1985ADM6400003

Turbidity, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations are key water quality parameters (WQPs) that reflect the level of water eutrophication in inland waters. Due to the complex interaction effects between different water quality in urban rivers, the water quality retrieval models still have the problem of single input features and poor applicability. This paper proposed a robust feature selection method based on machine learning and utilized Sentinel-2 remote sensing images for water quality retrieval of Chan and Ba rivers in Xi'an City. The ReliefF and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods (ReliefF-GSA) were used to select the optimal feature combination from the potential feature dataset. Based on the optimal feature combination, Random Forest regression (RFR), LightGBM and XGboost models were constructed for the three WQPs retrieval, respectively. The optimal models were then used to invert the three WQPs and the spatial-temporal variation of WQPs from January 2021 to January 2022 was analysed. The results show that (1) The RelieF-GSA method is suitable for high-dimensional feature filtration and enables optimal feature selection for specific WQPs retrieval. It is revealed that the BOI index (black odour water index) is the key feature for the retrieval of turbidity and TN concentration. (2) The RFR model was found to be better than other models and more appropriate for Chan and Ba rivers, with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.90, 0.89 and 0.81, respectively. (3) It was found that the water qualities in the Chan and Ba rivers have prominent seasonal characteristics. Turbidity and TP concentrations showed higher, while TN concentration showed relatively low in autumn. The method and conclusions of this paper can further provide a reference for WPQs retrieval in urban rivers.

GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Net photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf temperature (LT), transpiration rate (E) and in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored February 1996-February 1997 in Quercus ilex plants growing in the climax area (Rome) and in the Garda lake region. Photosynthetic activity is an appropriate temperature-dependent functional trait linked to plant metabolism and performance. We employed photosynthesis as a stress temperature indicator. Regression analysis showed that in such regional climatic conditions, net photosynthetic rates were primarily correlated with temperature. The introduction of rainfall in the function did not significantly improve the theoretical prevision, in the range of temperature and rainfall analysed. The favourable leaf temperatures allowing 90-100% of the highest photosynthetic rates were 14-28 degrees C, decreasing over 50% when leaf temperature were respectively below 6 degrees C and over 37 degrees C: the low potential photochemical efficiency of 0.71 PSII (Fv/Fm) at Castelporziano during summer, confirmed the state of stress. Transpiration rates remained high with the increase of leaf temperature in summer, in spite of the 46% decrease of stomatal conductance. Nevertheless, this decrease allowed the maintenance of acceptable Pn rates in stressful conditions. The potential productivity of Q. ilex lied on high peaks of activity during periods of lower evaporative demand and a rapid stomatal response to an increase in air temperature and soil water deficit. Although it is difficult to forecast Q. ilex productivity and plant structure, we may hypothesize its future presence in the Mediterranean Basin by the capability of vegetative activity in a wide range of temperatures, the high stomatal control in stressful conditions, the high plasticity index and water use efficiency (WUE).

J	Engel, Z; Cesák, J; Escobar, VR				Engel, Zbynek; Cesak, Julius; Escobar, Vanessa Rios			Rainfall-related debris flows in Carhuacocha Valley, Cordillera Huayhuash, Peru	LANDSLIDES												Continuous heavy rainfall hit northern Peru in the second half of the 2008/2009 summer season. From the end of January to the beginning of March, the Cordillera Huayhuash experienced abnormally high precipitations that exceeded 270 mm. The antecedent rainfall, aggravated with a severe rainstorm of 20 mm on March 7 triggered a large debris flow in the upper Carhuacocha Valley early in the morning on March 8. The debris flow interrupted drainage from the upper part of the valley damming a lake in the narrow depression between the trough slope and the lateral moraine. As a result of the drainage interruption, water percolated through the moraine dam of Cangrajanca Lake where a secondary mass movement occurred in its inner slope. In September 2009, we mapped the debris flow and related landforms and estimated the total area and volume of both mass movements using geodetic measurements. About 104,000 m(3) of sediments was moved from the trough slope towards the moraine from which 534,000 m(3) flowed to Cangrajanca Lake subsequently. We analysed the rainfall conditions that triggered the debris flow using rainfall data from the nearby stations. We also compared the precipitation preceding the event with the rainfall thresholds for debris flow initiation.

The lakes display great geomorphological and hydrochemical diversity. The aim of the study was to characterize temporal changes in the physicochemical conditions of the pit lakes over the last 30 years (1986-2016) and to determine the main factors influencing their evolution. All the lakes were characterized in terms of the same set of physicochemical parameters measured and used for comparative analysis with literature data from the years 1986 and 1992. The results showed significant temporal differentiation in terms of morphometric features and most of the physicochemical characteristics. pH, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+ and total Fe were among the most significantly differentiating parameters. A similar pattern of changes was found for most of the lakes, suggesting natural fluctuations. Despite the differences in values of thermal and oxygen profiles, there were also similarities in lake stratification. Additionally, meromictic conditions were found in 4 lakes. In some of the lakes a negative effect of neutralization and fertilization of the water was observed. Our results showed that the Muskau Arch lakes are subject to dynamic hydrogeological and hydrochemical changes. In addition to natural changes, human-caused transformations were among the key factors responsible for the differentiation of the physicochemical conditions.

Paleolimnological hydrogen and oxygen isotopes have been used to reconstruct changes in precipitation isotopes and continental climates. However, the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope records from lakes are rarely compared and integrated directly to study past changes in climate and environment due to their different fractionation pathways. Combined studies on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes would provide much more information than single isotope records. Here, we reanalyzed published lacustrine hydrogen and oxygen isotope records across the Tibetan Plateau, to investigate how both isotope records reveal the influences of the Indian summer monsoon and the westerlies on the Plateau throughout the Holocene. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that the first principal component (PC1) of 16 lacustrine hydrogen isotope records resembles that of 28 oxygen isotope records. The PC1s of the hydrogen and oxygen isotope records were generally low at 12-6 ka BP, followed by gradual increase since 6 ka BP, suggesting the influence of the Indian summer monsoon. Reconstruction of Holocene precipitation isotopes showed that the slopes of segmented precipitation isotope lines generally followed changes in monsoon intensity. The PC2s for hydrogen and oxygen isotope records remained relatively low at similar to 8-4 ka BP, coinciding with moisture variation in westerlies dominated regions. The millennial-scale variations in both hydrogen and oxygen isotope records, revealed by the PC3-PC6, likely responded to the ice drift events in the North Atlantic Ocean, as well as differences in the isotope fractionation pathways at specific sites. The reanalysis of stable hydrogen and oxygen records across the Tibetan Plateau suggests that the water vapor source is the most important factor affecting the isotope variation, though the isotopic fractionation processes may differ significantly. Our results revealed nonlinear variations of monsoon and westerlies on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. This review shows that integration of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope records would provide comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric circulation on the Tibetan Plateau.

It was referred to as the 'Red Dawn' event. Along its course across the state of New South Wales, the dust plume passed over Canberra, the capital of Australia located some 300 km from Sydney. In this study we identified the sources of the dust and tracked the progression of the dust storm using satellite imagery. We also examined the meteorological conditions that led to the formation of the dust plume. We also investigated the microbial and lipid composition, grain-size distribution, pollen content and geochemical composition of several samples of the dust that fell in Canberra (called 'Canberra dust'), with particular attention paid to the ratio of some rare earth elements as well as strontium and neodymium isotopes. This was done to identify a geochemical and palynological 'fingerprint' of this dust to determine the source of the material. Collectively, the meteorological and fingerprinting analyses identified the principal location of dust entrainment as between the large playa Lakes Gairdner and Torrens in arid South Australia, some 1600 km away from Canberra. We also determined through Sr isotope analyses and other elements measured in the dust that fell in Canberra and the township of Eden, located south of Sydney, that the dust changed composition slightly over a few hours, being the consequence of local dust entrainment along the path of the dust plume across South Australia and New South Wales. In addition, we present a scenario which explains dust transport away from the direction of the major dust plume. Those investigations carried out on the Canberra dust are compared with a previously documented event when dust was also sampled in Canberra in 2002. The origin and composition of the 2002 dust plume was clearly different from that which occurred in 2009, as demonstrated by the different chemical (organic and inorganic) composition, grain-size characteristics and palynological fingerprints, as well as microbial composition.

J	Belger, L; Forsberg, BR; Melack, JM				Belger, Lauren; Forsberg, Bruce R.; Melack, John M.			Carbon dioxide and methane emissions from interfluvial wetlands in the upper Negro River basin, Brazil	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Extensive interfluvial wetlands occur in the upper Negro River basin (Brazil) and contain a mosaic of vegetation dominated by emergent grasses and sedges with patches of shrubs and palms. To characterize the release of carbon dioxide and methane from these habitats, diffusive and ebullitive emissions and transport through plant aerenchyma were measured monthly during 2005 in permanently and seasonally flooded areas. CO2 emissions averaged 2193 mg C m(-2) day(-1). Methane was consumed in unflooded environments and emitted in flooded environments with average values of -4.8 and 60 mg C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Bubbles were emitted primarily during falling water periods when hydrostatic pressure at the sediment-water interface declined. CO2 and CH4 emissions increased when dissolved O-2 decreased and vegetation was more abundant. Total area and seasonally varying flooded areas for two wetlands, located north and south of the Negro River, were determined through analysis of synthetic aperture radar and optical remotely sensed data. The combined areas of these two wetlands (3000 km(2)) emitted 1147 Gg C year(-1) as CO2 and 31 Gg C year(-1) as CH4. If these rates are extrapolated to the area occupied by hydromorphic soils in the upper Negro basin, 63 Tg C year(-1) of CO2 and 1.7 Tg C year(-1) as CH4 are estimated as the regional evasion to the atmosphere.					; forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Belger, Lauren/B-6518-2014	forsberg, bruce/0000-0001-7606-0585; Belger, Lauren/0000-0002-6633-1975													0168-2563	1573-515X				SEP	2011	105	1-3					171	183		10.1007/s10533-010-9536-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-010-9536-0													WOS:000294501100013

Azam; Masabni, Joseph; Niu, Genhua			Cultivar-Specific Responses of Spinach to Root-Zone Cooling in Hydroponic Systems in a Greenhouse Under Warm Climates	SUSTAINABILITY												Growing spinach year-round via greenhouse hydroponics in warm climates can be challenging because of the intolerance of many spinach cultivars to heat. Root-zone cooling in hydroponic systems in warm climates may be a promising cooling method to alleviate heat stress; however, its effectiveness is still unknown in spinach plants. This study aimed to investigate the impact of root-zone cooling on the growth and physiological responses of four spinach cultivars ('Lakeside', 'Hammerhead', 'Mandolin', and 'SV2157') grown in deep water culture hydroponic systems in a greenhouse during the summer season in two growing cycles. The experiment consisted of the following three root-zone temperatures (RZTs): Control (ambient water temperature), RZT24 (24 degrees C), and RZT21 (21 degrees C). Among the four cultivars, 'SV2157' performed equally regardless of the treatment, demonstrating superior heat tolerance versus the other three cultivars. 'Mandolin' exhibited the greatest benefit from root-zone cooling, with increases in shoot dry weights of 87% and 94% under RZT24 and RZT21, respectively, compared to those under control treatment. Additionally, total leaf areas significantly increased under the two root-zone cooling treatments. 'Lakeside' and 'Hammerhead' generally benefited from root-zone cooling, although the magnitude of growth increases was small or statistically insignificant. However, 'Lakeside' and 'Hammerhead' were highly responsive to lower ambient air temperatures, as evidenced by increases of 121% and 90%, respectively, in shoot fresh weights across the treatments in Cycle 2 (average air temperature of 24.7 degrees C) compared to those in Cycle 1 (29.3 degrees C). Physiological responses to root-zone cooling varied among cultivars, with 'SV2157' exhibiting the highest chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin levels. Higher total phenolic contents under control treatment in Cycle 1 in all three cultivars except for 'SV2157' suggested greater reactive oxygen species production, indicating oxidative stress. Root-zone cooling reduced oxidative stress indicators, including mortality (%), hydrogen peroxide content, and malondialdehyde content, and minimized cell leakage. Based on plant growth, physiological and biochemical traits, and electricity consumption, cooling the root zone to 24 degrees C rather than 21 degrees C is recommended for hot summers with high air temperatures.					; Khan, Mehak Nawaz/JQJ-2104-2023	niu, genhua/0000-0001-5845-1873; Khan, Md Noor E Azam/0009-0001-5182-5307														2071-1050				APR 27	2025	17	9							3925	10.3390/su17093925	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17093925													WOS:001486512300001
J	Smith, R; Hamas, M; Dallman, M; Ewert, D				Smith, R; Hamas, M; Dallman, M; Ewert, D			Spatial variation in foraging of the Black-throated Green Warbler along the shoreline of northern Lake Huron	CONDOR												The Great Lakes strongly influence local climate, vegetation, and animal communities, all of which are important to both migrating and breeding birds. This influence can be considerable during springtime in nearshore habitats, as onshore winds depress air temperatures, delaying development of shoreline vegetation relative to inland areas. These developmental differences also may affect abundance, distribution, activity, and growth of insect prey, resulting in spatially-related differences in foraging by birds. Here we test the hypothesis that northern Lake Huron influences the foraging behavior of Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) during both migratory periods and the breeding season. We detected spatial variation in a number of variables we used to describe foraging, with most differences occurring during spring migration. We suggest that birds primarily varied foraging in response to spatial differences in prey resulting from microclimatic influences of nearby Lake Huron. We also suggest that emerging aquatic insects in shoreline habitats, primarily midges (Diptera: Chironomidae), are important to birds and propose that this abundant prey source has a primary influence on foraging.																			0010-5422					AUG	1998	100	3					474	484		10.2307/1369713	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1369713													WOS:000075307900007

Potential impacts of climate change on reservoir services and management approaches	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Reservoirs are important resources for supporting economic growth and provide numerous cultural and ecological services. Currently, loss of storage capacity due to sedimentation, water quality degradation, and toxins from blue-green algal blooms are issues that threaten reservoir services. Climate change is hypothesized to exacerbate these problems by increasing sediment and nutrient export from the surrounding watersheds, changing flow regimes, and increasing summer water temperatures. This report adds to the reservoir management literature by synthesizing the disparate literature on potential impacts of climate change to reservoir services and reviewing both watershed and in-reservoir management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change. In addition, this study can serve as a resource for managers who seek to study the impacts of climate change on reservoirs by compiling tools and data sources that have been successfully used to study the impacts of climate change on reservoir systems.					; Sturm, Belinda/M-9143-2019	Witthaus, Lindsey/0000-0002-0909-060X; Sturm, Belinda/0000-0002-5010-2078; 													1040-2381	2151-5530					2016	32	1					13	26		10.1080/10402381.2015.1107665	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2015.1107665													WOS:000372472200002

Feeding habits and ontogenic changes in digestive enzyme patterns in five freshwater teleosts	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Feeding habits and the activity of digestive enzymes (total alkaline proteases, -amylase and lipase) from dace Leuciscus leuciscus, roach Rutilus rutilus, Prussian carp Carassius auratus gibelio, perch Perca fluviatilis and pikeperch Sander lucioperca fry were studied in the Malye Chany Lake-Kargat Estuary (western Siberia, Russia). The diet of fry from all studied species was mainly composed of chironomid larvae and zooplanktonic organisms (i.e. cladocera and copepoda), whereas carnivorous species such as P. fluviatilis and S. lucioperca also preyed on fry from other fishes while detritus and microalgae were also important in the diet of ommivorous species. When comparing diet similarity (SOrensen-Dice index, Q(S)) among fry at different stages of development, both omnivorous and carnivorous species showed a high level of similarity (067<Q(S)<089 and 073<Q(S)<089, respectively). Diet similarity values were in agreement with the overall digestive activity profile analysed by cluster analysis. Diet similarity suggested potential trophic competition when zooplanktonic and benthic prey began to decline towards autumn. The analysis of pancreatic digestive enzymes revealed a correlation among their activities and fry feeding habits with -amylase:total proteases (A:P) values higher than 1 in omnivorous species and lower (A:P1) in carnivorous species.

J	Rinke, K; Yeates, P; Rothhaupt, KO				Rinke, Karsten; Yeates, Peter; Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto			A simulation study of the feedback of phytoplankton on thermal structure via light extinction	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. A simulation study of the feedback of phytoplankton biomass on temperature stratification in the large, monomictic Lake Constance was undertaken. Phytoplankton biomass affects the light extinction coefficient (LEC) of the water and, in turn, the vertical distribution of short-wave radiation, which shapes the temperature stratification in the lake. 2. A sensitivity study of the variation in LEC using the hydrodynamic model DYRESM showed that a high LEC is associated with stronger stratification, shallower thermoclines, higher surface temperatures and reduced heat content during the heating phase of the lake. During the cooling phase, a shallower thermocline at high LEC leads to a faster decrease in water temperature so that during autumn, a high LEC is associated with lower surface temperatures. Thermal structure was particularly sensitive to changes in LEC when its value was below 0.5 m-1. 3. When LEC is simulated dynamically with the coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model DYRESM-CAEDYM, its value is a function of phytoplankton dynamics that change vertically and temporally. Comparing simulations with and without dynamic LEC (i.e. with and without phytoplankton dynamics) produced a complex picture: during the vegetation period, we often found a warmer surface layer and colder water beneath in the simulations with dynamic LEC, as expected from the higher LEC when phytoplankton is abundant. However, since phytoplankton biomass (as LEC) fluctuates and because of occasional cooling phases, the patterns were comparatively weak and not consistent over the whole growing season. 4. The most obvious patterns emerged by comparing simulations of oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions. In the eutrophic state, with its higher LEC, stratification was stronger and characterized by higher surface water temperatures, a shallower thermocline and colder water temperatures between 5 and 10 m depth. 5. Statistical analysis of long-term data of water temperatures in Lake Constance, corrected for external forcing by air temperature, revealed a significant tendency towards warmer temperatures at 7.5 and 10 m depths with decreasing LECs over the course of reoligotrophication. This finding is consistent with our model results.

Based in qualitative research, including focus groups and key informant interviews conducted in the SON community in summer 2016, we identify the inter-related structural and relational mechanisms influencing the ability of SON community members to derive food security benefits, including culturally appropriate and nutritious diets and sustainable livelihoods, from local fisheries. There is, however, a need for ongoing efforts to better link the fisheries management, economic and cultural development, and traditional food access objectives of the community, ideally through better connecting and managing existing social networks.

We collected samples from the pelagic, littoral, and riverine zones of Lake Bangongco, located on the western side of the Plateau, to characterize bacterial community composition and geochemistry in three distinct, but hydrologically connected aquatic environments during summer. Bacterial community composition differed significantly among zones, with communities changing from riverine zones dominated by Bacteroidetes to littoral and pelagic zones dominated by Gammaproteobacteria. Community composition was strongly related to the geochemical environment, particularly concentrations of major ions and total nitrogen. The dominance of Gammaproteobacteria in the pelagic zone contrasts with typical freshwater bacterial communities as well as other lakes on the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Hölker, F; Breckling, B				Hölker, F; Breckling, B			A spatiotemporal individual-based fish model to investigate emergent properties at the organismal and the population level	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A spatiotemporal individual-based model (IBM) of roach (Rutilus rutilus) including bioenergetic principles was used to study emergent properties at the individual and the population level which appeared as a result of resource allocation and time scheduling of activities related to maintenance, growth, and reproduction in a seasonally changing environment. The model was used as a virtual laboratory to consider the impact of various parameters on vital rates and spatial behaviour of roach, which is particularly difficult to study in the field. The parameterisation based on field studies performed at Lake Belau (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) and laboratory measurements. This allowed us to explore the relationship between population structure and environmental heterogeneity on an integrated base. At the individual level emergent properties such as spatial behaviour, growth, and food consumption could be identified. Emergent properties at the population level resulted as phenotypic consequences of a trophic bottleneck, the influence of lake morphology on the phenotype as well as size-dependent winter mortality rates and post-reproductive mortality rates.

Most models hold that these events occurred through green corridors created during humid periods because arid intervals constrained population movements(2). Here we report an archaeological site-Shinfa-Metema 1, in the lowlands of northwest Ethiopia, with Youngest Toba Tuff cryptotephra dated to around 74,000 years ago-that provides early and rare evidence of intensive riverine-based foraging aided by the likely adoption of the bow and arrow. The diet included a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic animals. Stable oxygen isotopes from fossil mammal teeth and ostrich eggshell show that the site was occupied during a period of high seasonal aridity. The unusual abundance of fish suggests that capture occurred in the ever smaller and shallower waterholes of a seasonal river during a long dry season, revealing flexible adaptations to challenging climatic conditions during the Middle Stone Age. Adaptive foraging along dry-season waterholes would have transformed seasonal rivers into 'blue highway' corridors, potentially facilitating an out-of-Africa dispersal and suggesting that the event was not restricted to times of humid climates. The behavioural flexibility required to survive seasonally arid conditions in general, and the apparent short-term effects of the Toba supereruption in particular were probably key to the most recent dispersal and subsequent worldwide expansion of modern humans.

A review of the South American monsoon history as recorded in stable isotopic proxies over the past two millennia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We review the history of the South American summer monsoon (SASM) over the past similar to 2000 yr based on high-resolution stable isotope proxies from speleothems, ice cores and lake sediments. Our review is complemented by an analysis of an isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) for the past 130 yr. Proxy records from the monsoon belt in the tropical Andes and SE Brazil show a very coherent behavior over the past 2 millennia with significant decadal to multidecadal variability superimposed on large excursions during three key periods: the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the current warm period (CWP). We interpret these three periods as times when the SASM's mean state was significantly weakened (MCA and CWP) and strengthened (LIA), respectively. During the LIA each of the proxy archives considered contains the most negative delta O-18 values recorded during the entire record length. On the other hand, the monsoon strength is currently rather weak in a 2000-yr historical perspective, rivaled only by the low intensity during the MCA. Our climatic interpretation of these archives is consistent with our isotope-based GCM analysis, which suggests that these sites are sensitive recorders of large-scale monsoon variations. We hypothesize that these centennial-scale climate anomalies were at least partially driven by temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere and in particular over the North Atlantic, leading to a latitudinal displacement of the ITCZ and a change in monsoon intensity (amount of rainfall upstream over the Amazon Basin). This interpretation is supported by several independent records from different proxy archives and modeling studies. Although ENSO is the main forcing for delta O-18 variability over tropical South America on interannual time scales, our results suggest that its influence may be significantly modulated by North Atlantic climate variability on longer time scales. Finally, our analyses indicate that isotopic proxies, because of their ability to integrate climatic information on large spatial scales, could complement more traditional proxies such as tree rings or documentary evidence. Future climate reconstruction efforts could potentially benefit from including isotopic proxies as large-scale predictors in order to better constrain past changes in the atmospheric circulation.					; Burns, Stephen/H-9419-2013; Novello, Valdir/P-5824-2015; Taylor, Breana/ABT-3801-2022; Vuille, Mathias/S-3906-2019; Cruz, Francisco/G-6059-2012; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017	Vuille, Mathias/0000-0002-9736-4518; Cruz, Francisco/0000-0002-4030-4581; Novello, Valdir/0000-0002-0120-3745; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2012	8	4					1309	1321		10.5194/cp-8-1309-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-8-1309-2012													WOS:000308244600013
J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG				Fang, X; Stefan, HG			Projected climate change effects on winterkill in shallow lakes in the northern United States	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Each winter, hundreds of ice-covered, shallow lakes in the northern United States are aerated to prevent winterkill, the death of fish due to oxygen depletion under the ice. How will the projected climate warming influence winterkill and the need to artificially aerate lakes? To answer this question, a deterministic, one-dimensional year-round water quality model, which simulates daily dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles and associated water temperatures as well als ice/snow covers on lakes, was applied. Past and projected climate scenarios were investigated. The lake parameters required as model input are surface area, maximum depth, and Secchi depth as a measure of radiation attenuation and trophic state. The model is driven by daily weather data. Weather records from 209 stations in the contiguous United States for the period 1961-1979 were used to represent past climate conditions. The projected climate change due to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 was obtained from the output of the Canadian Climate Center General Circulation Model. To illustrate the effect of projected climate change on lake DO characteristics, we present herein DO information simulated, respectively, with inputs of past climate conditions (1961-1979) and with a projected 2 x CO2 climate scenario, as well as differences of those values. Specific parameters obtained were minimum under-ice and lake bottom DO concentration in winter, duration of under-ice anoxic conditions (<0.1 mg/liter) and low DO conditions (<3 mg/liter), and percentage of anoxic and low DO lake volumes during the ice cover period. Under current climate conditions winterkill occurs typically in shallow eutrophic lakes of the northern contiguous United States. Climate warming is projected to eliminate winterkill in these lakes. This would be a positive effect of climate warming. Fish species under ice may still experience periods of stress and zero growth due to low DO (<3 mg/liter) conditions under projected climate warming.																			0364-152X					MAR	2000	25	3					291	304		10.1007/s002679910023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002679910023								10629311					WOS:000084862800006

Here, we configured five separate SWAT (US Department of Agriculture's Soil and Water Assessment Tool) models to assess load reduction strategies for the agriculturally dominated Maumee River watershed, the largest P source contributing to toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie. Although several potential pathways may achieve the target loads, our results show that any successful pathway will require large-scale implementation of multiple practices. For example, one successful pathway involved targeting 50% of row cropland that has the highest P loss in the watershed with a combination of three practices: subsurface application of P fertilizers, planting cereal rye as a winter cover crop, and installing buffer strips. Achieving these levels of implementation will require local, state/provincial, and federal agencies to collaborate with the private sector to set shared implementation goals and to demand innovation and honest assessments of water quality-related programs, policies, and partnerships.

Extensive glycogen storage of hepatocyte nuclei could regularly be found in Arctic char from the 2 acidic high mountain lakes. In contrast, in Arctic char from the circumneutral lake (slightly acidic during winter), nuclear glycogen storage could only be documented in a few specimens. In alkaline lakes, however, nuclear glycogen deposition was absent in 64 out of 65 specimens. Additional nuclear pathology in char of the most acidic lake was evident from a reorganization of nucleolar components. The number of nuclei involved in glycogen storage showed a distinct seasonal pattern which correlated with the intensity of feeding, but not with the seasonality of other environmental parameters (trace metals, temperature, pH).																			0177-5103	1616-1580				FEB 13	1997	28	2					139	150		10.3354/dao028139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao028139													WOS:A1997WT47700007

The density of Rock Ptarmigan at Windy Lake declined during the 3 years of the study from 5.8 to 3.5 to 2.8 birds per 100 ha. The number of nesting pairs of raptors within 10 km of Windy Lake also declined during this period from 9 to 10 to 5. Nesting raptors included Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). Common Ravens (Corvus corax) were also present. During the breeding seasons of 1988 and 1989, 15% of the adult breeding population of Rock Ptarmigan were depredated. There was no sex or age bias among Rock Ptarmigan killed, but a temporal bias was recorded over the course of the breeding season. Predation was the proximate cause of death for 91 % of Rock Ptarmigan found dead over the three summers. Falcons accounted for 95% of all predation, the majority likely by Gyrfalcons.																			0892-1016					SEP	1992	26	3					146	151																WOS:A1992JU53900005
J	White, B; Matsumoto, K				White, Brooke; Matsumoto, Katsumi			Causal mechanisms of the deep chlorophyll maximum in Lake Superior: A numerical modeling investigation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) is a near ubiquitous feature in Lake Superior during the summer stratified season. Previous studies have elucidated observable characteristics of the DCM in Lake Superior but the physical and biological mechanisms controlling the creation and maintenance of the DCM remained unclear. We use a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Superior coupled to an ecological model to perform sensitivity runs exploring the influence of photoadaptation, photoinhibition, zooplankton grazing, and phytoplankton sinking on the vertical distribution of chlorophyll in the water column. The role of a nutricline in determining the presence and nature of the DCM is also explored. The presence of the DCM is dependent upon the presence of thermal stratification in the model. The sensitivity runs reveal that photoadaptation plays a primary role in determining the depth of the DCM in the model while zooplankton grazing and phytoplankton sinking affected the magnitude but not the presence or depth of the DCM. Photoinhibition showed negligible effects on chlorophyll concentration distribution. The presence of a nutricline in the model is also a necessary condition for the formation of the DCM and it influences both the depth and magnitude of the DCM.

J	KREBS, CJ; WINGATE, I				KREBS, CJ; WINGATE, I			POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SMALL MAMMALS OF THE KLUANE REGION, YUKON TERRITORY	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												From 1973 to 1977 we studied population changes in small rodents of the Kluane Lake region, southwestern Yukon. Six species were at maximal abundance in 1973 and were relatively scarce from 1974 to 1977. Only 1 sp., Microtus oeconomus (tundra vole), showed a correlation between body size and population size (the Chitty Effect). Reproductive rates varied among species but were not related to population density in any species. Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse) had the lowest reproductive rate because of a short breeding season, so that females had only 1 or 2 litters in most years. There was no evidence of winter breeding in any species. We conclude that none of the small rodent species in the Kluane region, except M. oeconomus, show good evidence of 3-4 yr population cycles. Density fluctuations are irregular and populations appear to be strongly r-selected in an unfavorable environment which is typically almost empty of rodents. [The other species studied were Clethrionomys rutilus, M. pennsylvanicus, Phenacomys intermedius, M. miurus, M. longicaudus, Synaptomys borealis, Lemmus sibiricus and Zapus hudsonicus.].																			0008-3550						1985	99	1					51	61																WOS:A1985AHC5800009

These samples were analyzed for trace elements via neutron activation analysis and aerosol concentrations were determined for the time period from 1992 through 1994. The seasonal trends of these aerosols were investigated and the results for bromine indicated seasonal highs in the month of March. This was different from the trend displayed by sodium whose peak was not as pronounced. Sodium was an indicator of the salt component of the aerosol that Br was associated with at this site. Wind trajectory end-point analysis was utilized to show that the high Br aerosol concentrations originate from the Arctic where Br aerosols have seasonal highs in the spring due to the photo-induced production of particulate Br. This research shows that the highest levels of the Br aerosol in the rural north Lake Huron area originate from the production of Br in the Arctic.

J	Istvánovics, V; Honti, M; Torma, P; Kousal, J				Istvanovics, Vera; Honti, Mark; Torma, Peter; Kousal, Josh			Record-setting algal bloom in polymictic Lake Balaton (Hungary): A synergistic impact of climate change and (mis)management	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												After 25 years of apparently successful eutrophication management, a record-breaking mixed bloom of Ceratium furcoides and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae developed unexpectedly in 2019 in the large, polymictic Lake Balaton. The peak concentration of chlorophyll exceeded 300 mg/m(3), 1.5 times higher than the pre-management maxima. The external load was insufficient to provide the phosphorus (P) required to support this bloom, and its taxonomic composition was radically different from blooms in the 1980s. We hypothesised: (1) that unusually long periods of intermittent stratification led to anoxic P release from the sediments, providing the required P; and (2) that the surprising bloom composition indicated a potential regime shift. To test hypothesis 1, we analysed decade-long high-frequency data on drivers of lake metabolism recorded at a shallow near-shore observatory. To explore likely dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions in deep water in 2019, we performed a sensitivity analysis of a one-dimensional DO model driven by the General Ocean Turbulence Model, the latter being calibrated against high-frequency hydrometeorological data measured in the open water. Hypothesis 2 was examined by a sequential t-test analysis applied to multidecadal (1976-2020) data on phytoplankton biomass and composition, nutrient loads and summer mean air temperature. We found that DO depletion (<1 g/m(3)) was the immediate precursor of the large 2019 bloom. The synergistic impact of a climatic regime shift and multiple coincident management actions provoked a shift in phytoplankton composition in 2013 and forced the ecosystem into the state of internal eutrophication. In the present ecosystem state, similarly large blooms could develop in any summer depending on the sequence of weather events. Within the present, warmer climate regime identified here, the effectiveness of external nutrient control in eutrophication management may be limited by changes in the thermal structure. Therefore, it is vital to supplement external nutrient control with internal nutrient control strategies, such as water level regulation, to manage eutrophication and prevent future blooms. Large, continuous polymictic lakes are susceptible to small changes in water level, because the likelihood of stratification (and thus the likeliness of a eutrophication event) increases steeply and non-linearly with increasing depth. With a climate that continues to warm, and the associated changes expected in internal lake processes, it is possible that we will see regime shifts (such as that identified in Lake Balaton) across more lakes globally. Managing these conditions will require case-specific modifications of lake management plans.

At approximate to 54m below the lake floor, shear strength and high-resolution bulk density measurements suggest the presence of an unconformity in the varved proglacial clays. Incremental load consolidation tests reveal highly overconsolidated sediments below this level. Preconsolidation pressures for the underlying sediments are between 1250 and 2100kPa, up to approximate to 1700kPa more than the current in-situ effective stress. The highly overconsolidated sediments indicate either substantial erosion (the removal of 215-360m of sediment), or consolidation under a large grounded ice mass sitting up to 230m above paleo-lake level. Glaciotectonic deformation in underlying sediments supports the interpretation of a grounded ice mass. It is likely that this horizon is either contemporaneous with or older than the Levene moraine, formed between 13.4 and 13.8ka. In the approximate to 30m of overlying proglacial clays, there is no further evidence for grounded ice, indicating that any ice advance to southern Lake Vattern during the Younger Dryas would have been limited to an extremely thin ice tongue.

We obtained model lake climatology through offline runs of a lake model FLake (Freshwater Lake model) with different values of lake depth parameter. As a result, a global dataset with the resolution of 1 degrees was developed. To project lake climatology onto a particular NWP model grid, data are extracted from the dataset depending on the lake depth value provided on the target grid. To prevent drifting of the bottom temperature in warm deep lakes, relaxation to the long-term mean air temperature was applied in FLake. Lake model climatology was validated against observations for different types of lakes. We suppose that detected errors for boreal lakes in spring are connected with inaccuracies in forcing data, but further study of errors is needed.					; Le+Moigne, Patrick/AAU-9622-2020	Batrak, Yurii/0000-0003-0756-2295; Martin, Eric/0000-0002-1491-9590													0280-6495						2012	64								17226	10.3402/tellusa.v64i0.17226	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v64i0.17226													WOS:000302382900001

However, uncertainties remain in the history and driving mechanisms of precipitation changes in this region over the past two millennia. We present an 1800 yr multiproxy reconstruction of monsoon precipitation based on hydroclimate variations inferred from Lake Nvshan sediments in the Jiang-Huai region of central eastern China. We find that rainfall in the Jiang-Huai region was higher during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), and that these changes were modulated by the mean state of the tropical Pacific Ocean on centennial time scales. We infer that an El Nino-like (La Nina-like) mean state caused a strengthening and westward displacement (weakening and eastward displacement) of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) and a weakening (strengthening) of the EASM, causing more (less) rainfall in the Jiang-Huai region during the LIA (MWP). These hydroclimate changes are likely to have been a response to changes in effective radiative forcing.

Diatoms dominated both the species diversity and biomass, while among the small centric species, Lindavia (Cyclotella) comensis Grunow showed excessive reproduction. L. bodanica Eulenstein, Achnanthidium minutissimum Kutzing and Diatoma mesodon (Ehrenberg) Kutzing are the other subdominant taxa. The distribution of algae groups in phytoplankton concentration is as follows: Diatoms > Chlorophytes > Cyanophytes > Ochrophytes.

The food habits of the bird were studied based on 66 stomachs in 1998 and 2001-2002, and a seasonal variation in food contents was observed. The proportion of ayu in stomachs increased after April, and became most dominant during July and August (0.62 in proportion of weight, 0.85 in frequency of occurrence). In contrast, ayu was not found in the stomachs after late October. The increase of ayu in individuals and density in the surface layer of the pelagic zone of the lake during spring was considered as a trigger for the change of the food habits of the birds. The feeding impact of great cormorant on ayu in Lake Biwa was estimated to be approximately 46 t during April to June, and 310 t in July and August. During the main period for the commercial ayu catch (November to the following June), the estimated mass consumed by the bird is much smaller in comparison with the commercial catch.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				JUN	2006	72	3					477	484		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01175.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01175.x													WOS:000238065900004

During this episode temperature profiles, sediment size distributions, bulk density, and settling rates showed that the jet-generated turbulence produced strong mixture in the central core of the conic depression forming the basin. Data from another basin where the sediment was always in suspension are presented for comparison. Here, the stratification in density and settling rate of the particles suggest sorting out of the aggregates, with the largest flocs occupying the deepest parts of the basin.

J	Forget-Klein, É; Green, DM				Forget-Klein, Emilie; Green, David M.			Toads use the subsurface thermal gradient for temperature regulation underground	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												As ectotherms with moist, permeable skins, amphibians continually seek a physiological balance between maintaining hydration and optimizing body temperature. Laboratory studies have suggested that dehydrated and starved amphibians should select cooler temperatures to slow the rate of water loss and reduce metabolism. However, much less is known about amphibian thermoregulatory behaviour in the wild, where environmental conditions and constraints may be more variable. In seasonally cold environments, where animals must maximize growth, gamete production and/or fat storage for winter dormancy over a short active season, maintaining a high metabolic rate may be primary. We investigated the thermoregulatory behaviour of the Fowler's Toads, Anaxyrus fowleri, in the wild at their northern range limit at Long Point, Ontario. We outfitted adult toads with small temperature loggers and radio-tracked them for periods of 24 hours. Simultaneously, we also recorded air and subsurface temperatures to a depth of 18.6 cm. When active at night, toads rapidly equilibrated with ambient air temperatures. However, during the day, resting toads selected and maintained body temperatures around 30 degrees C during the heat of the day by adjusting the depth to which they were buried. This strongly suggests that they behaviourally thermoregulate during their resting hours to maintain a high metabolic rate without regard to the dryness of their immediate surroundings.

During most of this period there has been no significant tidal or marine influence, and the lagoon is now schizohaline. Rainfall is seasonal: more than 50% is during June-August. Annual evaporation is 2.5 times precipitation, causing the lagoon to be intermittent, drying up during the summer. These conditions, plus the abundance of photosynthetic organisms, lead to widespread carbonate mud accumulation throughout most of the lagoon. This mud, up to 30 cm thick in some parts of the lagoon, is typically in the form of < 2 mu m crystals. Unlike other carbonate-accumulating back-barrier lagoons, most of the CaCO3 is low-Mg calcite with some skeletal aragonite. High-Mg calcite is present in two small lakes within the Pleistocene barrier immediately landward of Lake Reeve, and no dolomite was detected. We interpret the carbonate mud to have resulted from the activities of cyanobacteria, which are abundant through much of Lake Reeve.																			1073-130X					JAN 2	1995	65	1					178	184																WOS:A1995QE05100019

The research was carried out in selected lakes located within the administrative boundaries of the city of Olsztyn, the largest city in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The experiment was conducted in three summer seasons near bathing sites in three lakes, which are the most popular as recreational sites (Lake Kortowskie, Lake Tyrsko, and Lake Skanda). Microfungi isolated from the phyllosphere of 13 plant species of the littoral zone from dropped leaves of coast plants with no disease symptoms were used as the study material. The isolated fungi were identified in accordance with the accepted diagnostic procedures applied in mycological laboratories. A total of 36 yeast species of 16 genera were identified. Fungi found earlier at the bathing sites of the lakes were identified in 60% of the cases. Nine species were categorised as class BSL-2 fungi. This study provides a valuable complement of data concerning the natural composition of the littoral microbiota.					; Biedunkiewicz, Anna/K-9858-2018; Kulesza, Kamila/JNQ-9823-2023; Kubiak, Dariusz/AAY-1341-2020	Kulesza, Kamila/0000-0002-2486-2444; Kondratowicz (Nowacka), Karolina/0000-0002-5773-7949; Biedunkiewicz, Anna/0000-0003-3498-7432; Kubiak, Dariusz/0000-0001-7266-0647; Sucharzewska, Ewa/0000-0001-6754-5994; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				APR	2020	79	3					552	561		10.1007/s00248-019-01447-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-019-01447-y		OCT 2019						31655872					WOS:000492638100001

Remote Sensing of the North American Laurentian Great Lakes' Surface Temperature	REMOTE SENSING												The Great Lakes Surface Temperature (GLST) is the key to understanding the effects of climate change on the Great Lakes (GL). This study provides the first techniques to retrieve pixel-based GLST under all sky conditions by merging skin temperature derived from the MODIS Land Surface Temperature (MOD11L2) and the MODIS Cloud product (MOD06L2) from 6 July 2001 to 31 December 2014, resulting in 18,807 scenes in total 9373 (9434) scenes for MOD11L2 (MOD06L2). The pixel-based GLST under all sky conditions was well-correlated with the in situ observations (R-2 = 0.9102) with a cool bias of -1.10 degrees C and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.39 degrees C. The study also presents the long-term trends of GLST. Contrary to expectations, it decreased slightly due to the impact of an anomalously cold winter in 2013-2014.					; Moukomla, Sitthisak/AEA-3849-2022	Moukomla, Sitthisak/0000-0003-4054-4670; BLANKEN, PETER/0000-0002-7405-2220													2072-4292					APR	2016	8	4							286	10.3390/rs8040286	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8040286													WOS:000375156500019
J	Kann, J; Smith, VH				Kann, J; Smith, VH			Estimating the probability of exceeding elevated pH values critical to fish populations in a hypereutrophic lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Current eutrophication models typically are used to predict seasonal mean conditions. However, the risk of summer fish kills in hypereutrophic lakes is likely to be more closely dependent on periodic extreme events, such as potentially lethal peaks in pH driven by algal photosynthesis. In hypereutrophic Upper Klamath and Agency lakes, Oregon, peak summertime pH values frequently exceed critical levels that can reduce fish growth and survival (pH > 9.50, a likely sublethal tolerance limit for two resident endangered fish species). We developed two empirical models, one parametric and one nonparametric, that predict the likelihood of exceeding user-defined critical values of pH from concentrations of chlorophyll a in these lakes. Separate models were derived to incorporate seasonal dynamics and differences between the two lakes, and the behavior of these models was tested under four different critical pH scenarios. Both parametric and nonparametric models performed similarly, suggesting that management efforts to reduce chlorophyll a in these lakes from 200 to 100 mu g.L-1 should decrease the probability of exceeding pH 9.5 by 45%. We suggest that this general approach potentially can be applied to the management of fish populations in other hypereutrophic lakes as well.																			0706-652X					DEC	1999	56	12					2262	2270		10.1139/cjfas-56-12-2262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-12-2262													WOS:000084267600005

GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												This paper examines new geomorphological, chronological and modelling data on glacier fluctuations in southernmost South America in latitudes 46-55 degrees S during the last glacial-interglacial transition. Establishing leads and lags between the northern and southern hemispheres and between southern mid-latitudes and Antarctica is key to an appreciation of the mechanisms and resilience of global climate. This is particularly important in the southern hemisphere where there is a paucity of empirical data. The overall structure of the last glacial cycle in Patagonia has a northern hemisphere signal. Glaciers reached or approached their Last Glacial Maxima on two or more occasions at 25-23 ka (calendar) and there was a third less extensive advance at 17.5 ka. Deglaciation occurred in two steps at 17.5 ka and at 11.4 ka. This structure is the same as that recognized in the northern hemisphere and taking place in spite of glacier advances occurring at a time of high southern hemisphere summer insolation and deglaciation at a time of decreasing summer insolation. The implication is that at orbital time scales the 'northern' signal dominates any southern hemisphere signal. During deglaciation, at a millennial scale, the glacier fluctuations mirror an antiphase 'southern' climatic signal as revealed in Antarctic ice cores. There is a glacier advance coincident with the Antarctic Cold Reversal at 15.3-12.2 ka. Furthermore, deglaciation begins in the middle of the Younger Dryas. The implication is that, during the last glacial-interglacial transition, southernmost South America was under the influence of sea surface temperatures, sea ice and southern westerlies responding to conditions in the 'southern' Antarctic domain. Such asynchrony may reflect a situation whereby, during deglaciation, the world is more sensitized to fluctuations in the oceanic thermohaline circulation, perhaps related to the bipolar seesaw, than at orbital timescales.					; Bentley, Michael/F-7386-2011; Fogwill, Christopher/KWU-8243-2024; Fogwill, Chris/AAW-3502-2021	McCulloch, Robert/0000-0001-5542-3703; Bentley, Michael/0000-0002-2048-0019; Fogwill, Christopher/0000-0002-6471-1106; 													0435-3676	1468-0459					2005	87A	2					273	288		10.1111/j.0435-3676.2005.00259.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0435-3676.2005.00259.x													WOS:000230361200002

Highly permeable structures, such as faults, provide fluid channels that are the most suitable access points to the geothermal resource. Accurate mapping of these structures therefore guides the successful targeting of wells. Lakes, rivers or ocean, can hide surface footprints of these permeable structures, such as in our case beneath Lake Linau. High-resolution bathymetry identifies linear and conical discontinuities, which are linked to offshore tectonic structures as confirmed by surrounding outcrops and hot springs. Geochemical measurements document inflow of hot saline acidic water into the lake verifying bathymetry-located highly permeable structures. Integrating onshore well data, our bathymetry and chemical results locates an ideal drilling site into the geothermal reservoir beneath the western shore line of Lake Linau.

J	CAMPBELL, P				CAMPBELL, P			PHOSPHORUS BUDGETS AND STOICHIOMETRY DURING THE OPEN-WATER SEASON IN 2 UNMANIPULATED LAKES IN THE EXPERIMENTAL LAKES AREA, NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A comparative mass-balance approach is used to describe and quantify phosphorus (P) cycles during the open-water season in two unmanipulated Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) lakes. A bimodal cycle generally prevailed, in which water-column total phosphorus (TP = total dissolved P plus sestonic particulate P) peaked just after ice-out and again late in the summer. Changes in mass of water-column TP were often much larger than corresponding net external inputs. Shifts of P to and from either zooplankton or fish in the water column do not explain the P residuals. Rather, the bottom sediments must have been adding P to the water column. Short-term regeneration of P from the bottom sediments also probably occurs in artificially eutrophied ELA lakes. The mechanism of regeneration is probably biological. Other aspects of P cycling and P stoichiometry are discussed, particularly in relation to nutrient control of population structure and the function of primary and secondary producers.																			0706-652X					DEC	1994	51	12					2739	2755		10.1139/f94-275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-275													WOS:A1994RD71800013

The mammals were live-trapped from the various ecological habitats and careful attention paid to host distribution, host-parasite interrelationship, and factors affecting distribution of parasitic spp. geographically and seasonally. Twenty-three spp. of nematodes were recovered, 6 of which may constitute new forms. Animals collected during May, June and early July had a combined incidence of infection of 39.2% while those collected during August and September has 60%. Reasons for the increase in the late season group were found to be due to (1) seasonal distribution, spp. with stomach-inhabiting spirurid forms being found only in the July-August-September group; (2) increased use of insects for food in the late season group, as these are intermediate hosts for spirurid worms; (3) increased population density of mammal spp. later in the summer, leading to increased probability of infection.																			0022-3395	1937-2345					1957	43	1					105	112		10.2307/3274773	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3274773								13406677					WOS:A1957XE82900033

We present a detailed record of vegetation and climate changes over the past 1.74 million years in a lake sediment core from the Zoige Basin, eastern Tibetan Plateau. Results show three intervals with different orbital- and millennial-scale features superimposed on a stepwise long-term cooling trend. The interval of 1.74-1.54 million years ago is characterized by an insolation-dominated mode with strong similar to 20,000-year cyclicity and quasi-absent millennial-scale signal. The interval of 1.54-0.62 million years ago represents a transitional insolation-ice mode marked by similar to 20,000- and similar to 40,000-year cycles, with superimposed millennial-scale oscillations. The past 620,000 years are characterized by an ice-driven mode with 100,000-year cyclicity and less frequent millennial-scale variability. A pronounced transition occurred 620,000 years ago, as glacial cycles intensified. These new findings reveal how the interaction of low-latitude insolation and high-latitude ice-volume forcing shaped the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau climate.

Factors modulating cottongrass seedling growth stimulation to enhanced nitrogen and carbon dioxide: compensatory tradeoffs in leaf dynamics and allocation to meet potassium-limited growth	OECOLOGIA												Eriophorum vaginatum is a characteristic species of northern peatlands and a keystone plant for cutover bog restoration. Understanding the factors affecting E. vaginatum seedling establishment (i.e. growth dynamics and allocation) under global change has practical implications for the management of abandoned mined bogs and restoration of their C-sequestration function. We studied the responses of leaf dynamics, above- and belowground biomass production of establishing seedlings to elevated CO2 and N. We hypothesised that nutrient factors such as limitation shifts or dilutions would modulate growth stimulation. Elevated CO2 did not affect biomass, but increased the number of young leaves in spring (+400 %), and the plant vitality (i.e. number of green leaves/total number of leaves) (+3 %), both of which were negatively correlated to [K+] in surface porewater, suggesting a K-limited production of young leaves. Nutrient ratios in green leaves indicated either N and K co-limitation or K limitation. N addition enhanced the number of tillers (+38 %), green leaves (+18 %), aboveground and belowground biomass (+99, +61 %), leaf mass-to-length ratio (+28 %), and reduced the leaf turnover (-32 %). N addition enhanced N availability and decreased [K+] in spring surface porewater. Increased tiller and leaf production in July were associated with a doubling in [K+] in surface porewater suggesting that under enhanced N production is K driven. Both experiments illustrate the importance of tradeoffs in E. vaginatum growth between: (1) producing tillers and generating new leaves, (2) maintaining adult leaves and initiating new ones, and (3) investing in basal parts (corms) for storage or in root growth for greater K uptake. The K concentration in surface porewater is thus the single most important factor controlling the growth of E. vaginatum seedlings in the regeneration of selected cutover bogs.

Freshwater Outburst from Lake Superior as a Trigger for the Cold Event 9300 Years Ago	SCIENCE												Paleoclimate proxy records reveal a pervasive cooling event with a Northern Hemispheric extent similar to 9300 years ago. Coeval changes in the oceanic circulation of the North Atlantic imply freshwater forcing. However, the source, magnitude, and routing of meltwater have remained unknown. Located in central North America, Lake Superior is a key site for regulating the outflow of glacial meltwater to the oceans. Here, we show evidence for an similar to 45-meter rapid lake-level fall in this basin, centered on 9300 calibrated years before the present, due to the failure of a glacial drift dam on the southeast corner of the lake. We ascribe the widespread climate anomaly similar to 9300 years ago to this freshwater outburst delivered to the North Atlantic Ocean through the Lake Huron-North Bay-Ottawa River-St. Lawrence River valleys.

The freezing of water flow to freezing thickening is a nonisothermal-flow phase transition process coupled with the water flow temperature, environment and riverbank. Here, the Nusselt number and viscous dissipation are used to consider the flow velocity influence on icing, and a thermodynamic model of static ice cover horizontal distribution considering riverbed heat transfer is established. The initial ice time, freezing time and static ice cover thickness formed by static and dynamic water calculated by the model were consistent with measured data. The model reflects the horizontal growth process of the static ice cover, which was significant for narrow and deep channels. The horizontal distribution of the static ice cover was thin in the center and thick on both sides. The maximum horizontal thickness difference of -20 degrees C indoor freezing for 24 h reached 15% of the central ice thickness. Compared with the degree-day method for calculating ice thickness, the numerical model and dimensionless formula better reflect the growth law and horizontal distribution characteristics of static ice cover and provide a theoretical basis for safe water conveyance under ice cover in winter and ice cover formation in reservoirs and lakes in cold regions.																				2073-4441				NOV	2023	15	22							3893	10.3390/w15223893	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15223893													WOS:001113965100001

Airborne and ground-based observations of ammonium-nitrate-dominated aerosols in a shallow boundary layer during intense winter pollution episodes in northern Utah	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Airborne and ground-based measurements of aerosol concentrations, chemical composition, and gas-phase precursors were obtained in three valleys in northern Utah (USA). The measurements were part of the Utah Winter Fine Particulate Study (UWFPS) that took place in January-February 2017. Total aerosol mass concentrations of PM1 were measured from a Twin Otter aircraft, with an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). PM1 concentrations ranged from less than 2 mu g m(-3) during clean periods to over 100 mu g m(-3) during the most polluted episodes, consistent with PM2.5 total mass concentrations measured concurrently at ground sites. Across the entire region, increases in total aerosol mass above similar to 2 mu g m(-3) were associated with increases in the ammonium nitrate mass fraction, clearly indicating that the highest aerosol mass loadings in the region were predominantly attributable to an increase in ammonium nitrate. The chemical composition was regionally homogenous for total aerosol mass concentrations above 17.5 mu g m(-3), with 74 +/- 5 % (average +/- standard deviation) ammonium nitrate, 18 +/- 3 % organic material, 6 +/- 3 % ammonium sulfate, and 2 +/- 2 % ammonium chloride. Vertical profiles of aerosol mass and volume in the region showed variable concentrations with height in the polluted boundary layer. Higher average mass concentrations were observed within the first few hundred meters above ground level in all three valleys during pollution episodes. Gas-phase measurements of nitric acid (HNO3) and ammonia (NH3) during the pollution episodes revealed that in the Cache and Utah valleys, partitioning of inorganic semi-volatiles to the aerosol phase was usually limited by the amount of gas-phase nitric acid, with NH3 being in excess. The inorganic species were compared with the ISORROPIA thermodynamic model. Total inorganic aerosol mass concentrations were calculated for various decreases in total nitrate and total ammonium. For pollution episodes, our simulations of a 50 % decrease in total nitrate lead to a 46 +/- 3 % decrease in total PM1 mass. A simulated 50 % decrease in total ammonium leads to a 36 +/- 17 % mu g m(-3) decrease in total PM1 mass, over the entire area of the study. Despite some differences among locations, our results showed a higher sensitivity to decreasing nitric acid concentrations and the importance of ammonia at the lowest total nitrate conditions. In the Salt Lake Valley, both HNO3 and NH3 concentrations controlled aerosol formation.

Geological Setting, Volcanic Stratigraphy, and Flank Failure of the El Estribo Volcano, Patzcuaro (Michoacan, Mexico)	STRATI 2013	Springer Geology				1st International Congress on Stratigraphy (STRATI)	JUL 01-07, 2013	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	IUGS, Int Commiss Stratig, New Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Geol Sci & Engn, New Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci & Techno, Dept Earth Sci, GALP Energia SGPS S A, Partex Oil & Gas, Inst Francais Portugal, Centro Investigacao Ciencia & Engn Geologica, New Univ Lisbon				The El Estribo Volcano is located within the Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic Field in western Mexico. Previous works have considered this volcano as a single cinder cone. The results of this study, however, suggest that it consists of a basal shield volcano crowned by a cinder cone. The upper cinder cone has a 1.2 km base and a 0.5 km crater with a maximum altitude of 2450 m a.s.l. The shield volcano has a basal diameter of 3.6 km and it is cut by an E-W-oriented normal fault. Several landslides have been triggered at the fault scarp, resulting in debris avalanche deposits being emplaced to the north into Lake Patzcuaro. A refined stratigraphy of El Estribo Volcano comprises three main lithological units (Flv-la, E-Sh, and E-Ci): (1) three different sequences of lacustrine and ash layers with ages >30,000 yr, 10,000-30,000 yr, and <3000 yr, respectively (Flv-la); (2) basaltic-andesitic lava flows of the shield volcano (E-Sh); and (3) stratified scoria falls, reworked beds, and scoria falls interbedded with pyroclastic surge deposits (E-Ci) covering a palaeosol dated at 28,360 +/- 170 yr BP (Ps). The southern shore of Lake Patzcuaro is characterized by at least two debris-avalanche deposits, with marked differences in morphology. The first one, dated at 28,000 yr BP, presents an emplacement length of 3.2 km and a height/length (H/L) ratio of 0.06. The second one, dated at 14,000 yr BP, has a maximum run-out of 2 km and an H/L ratio of 0.08. The causes of these collapses are still under study and may involve the operation of different factors, such as: (i) destabilization during the emplacement of the cinder cone; (ii) different rock strengths between the involved rocks and sediments; (iii) seismic events; and (iv) slope instability.

J	Pezold, F				Pezold, F			Fish diversity in an isolated artificial wetland	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Adult, juvenile and larval fishes were sampled in a managed isolated wetland in the Red Chute Bayou floodplain, LA from December 1994 to July 1995. Nineteen species were captured. Principal components analysis of adult fishes showed little difference between sites, but a gradient of habitats and seasons reflecting variable richness was observed. Bowfin (Amia calva), black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) and fliers (Centrarchus macropterus) were the dominant adult fishes. Juvenile and post-larval fishes had low catch-per-unit-effort and were dominated by fliers. Principal components analysis distinguished three habitat groups and significant seasonal variation in the juvenile/post-larval fish community. The ichthyofauna resembled that described for irregularly inundated isolated floodplain ponds of the lower Mississippi River valley. The relatively low diversity of this system is probably due to the isolation of the backwaters from active river cycles. The problem may be further compounded by the timing of water drawdown in late spring.

Diatom assemblages promote ice formation in large lakes	ISME JOURNAL												We present evidence for the directed formation of ice by planktonic communities dominated by filamentous diatoms sampled from the ice-covered Laurentian Great Lakes. We hypothesize that ice formation promotes attachment of these non-motile phytoplankton to overlying ice, thereby maintaining a favorable position for the diatoms in the photic zone. However, it is unclear whether the diatoms themselves are responsible for ice nucleation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed associations of bacterial epiphytes with the dominant diatoms of the phytoplankton assemblage, and bacteria isolated from the phytoplankton showed elevated temperatures of crystallization (T-c) as high as -3 degrees C. Ice nucleation-active bacteria were identified as belonging to the genus Pseudomonas, but we could not demonstrate that they were sufficiently abundant to incite the observed freezing. Regardless of the source of ice nucleation activity, the resulting production of frazil ice may provide a means for the diatoms to be recruited to the overlying lake ice, thereby increasing their fitness. Bacterial epiphytes are likewise expected to benefit from their association with the diatoms as recipients of organic carbon excreted by their hosts. This novel mechanism illuminates a previously undescribed stage of the life cycle of the meroplanktonic diatoms that bloom in Lake Erie and other Great Lakes during winter and offers a model relevant to aquatic ecosystems having seasonal ice cover around the world.

The 1972 community of submerged vascular plants was severely affected. Standing crops were drastically reduced and the species composition of the plant community changed compared to 1970. In 1973, standing crop values had increased to 87% of those of 1970. Shifts in spatial distribution had occurred and the community had further changed to one highly dominated by Myriophyllum sp. with the virtual exclusion of some previously abundant forms, especially Heteranthera dubia.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1976	48	3					251	255		10.1007/BF00028697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00028697													WOS:A1976BQ48500008

The dwindling Lake Victoria water level	Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Environmentally Sound Technology in Water Resources Management: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY					IASTED International Conference on Environmentally Sound Technology in Water Resources Management	SEP 11-13, 2006	Univ Botswana, Gaborone, BOTSWANA	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev, Potswana Power Corp, BCL Min Co, Broadband Botswana Internet	Univ Botswana			This paper analyses the operation of the Owen Falls (Nalubale) dam as a run-of-the river facility or according to what came to be known as the "Agreed Curve". The outflows at Jinja had to be effected in such a way that the original relationship between the Jinja releases/outflow and the lake level was maintained as before the construction of the Owen Falls dam. Comparison of the trend of the Jinja releases and satellite Lake Victoria height variations was carried out from 1998 to 2004. Rainfall, evaporation and drought conditions for the same period were reviewed to assess their possible effects on the lake level. The results indicated that the operation of the dam according to the agreed curve was followed for most of the time varying the Jinja releases according to lake level as required until about 2001. Thereafter Jinja releases were progressively increased to the maximum ever in 2004 without regard to changes in lake levels. This meant that the operation of the dam/s was no longer based on the agreed curve after 2001. No significant influence on lake level could be deduced from changes in rainfall, evaporation and drought conditions as these remained essentially about average at least up to 2004. The conclusion from this analysis was therefore that the diminishing Lake Victoria level experienced from 2003 was mainly due to the departure from the original operation policy at the Nalubale dam which meant that more water than authorized by the agreed curve was being released.																					978-0-88986-622-5				2006							85	90																WOS:000246299300016
J	Li, TH; Zhong, W; Quan, MY; Wang, XJ; Yu, J				Li, Tianhang; Zhong, Wei; Quan, Mingying; Wang, Xiaojun; Yu, Jian			A 47.0-kyr record of mercury deposition in lake sediments from Dahu swamp in the East Nanling Mountains, southern China: Implications for paleoclimatic and environmental changes	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												In this study, we provide an similar to 47.0-kyr mercury (Hg) deposition record derived from a lacustrine sedimentary sequence in Dahu swamp in the eastern Nanling Mountains, China. The results indicate that organic matter (OM) input played a role in Hg accumulation, whereas the contribution of inorganic weathering detritus had a negligible impact. On the other hand, evolution of the plant community and wildfire events were also important factors affecting Hg accumulation. Compared to arboreal plants, lower (herbs and ferns) plants had stronger absorption and enrichment ability for Hg thus favoring enhanced Hg accumulation in the sediments. We therefore infer that Hg deposition in Dahu sediments was greatly controlled by changes in climatic conditions. Relatively dry and cold climatic conditions, which resulted in reduced arboreal plant communities and increased lower plants, would favor an increased Hg accumulation rate; furthermore, dry conditions may cause more wildfire events thus leading to enhanced release of Hg into the environment and increased contribution of Hg to the sediments, whereas relatively wet and warm conditions would result in the opposite situation. The record of Hg deposition demonstrates a synchronous orbital-scale variation trend with the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon. Period analysis reveals several millennial- and centennial-scale cycles similar to solar insolation, together with several millennial events of increased Hg concentration and accumulation rate, which coincided with the corresponding Heinrich events, suggesting joint impacts of solar irradiation and the action of melting water as well as changes in zonal atmospheric circulation on Hg accumulation in Dahu sediments.

The SHWW are the most powerful prevailing winds on Earth. Their variation plays a role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels and rainfall amounts and distribution, both today and in the past. We obtained a piston core (LF06-PC8) from Bahia Grande, a protected sub-basin at the southern margin of Lago Fagnano, the largest lake in Tierra del Fuego. This article focuses on the uppermost 185 cm of this core, corresponding to laminated sediment from the last similar to 6.3 ka. Laminations consist of millimetre-scale paired dark and light layers. Previous studies and new geochemical analysis show that the dark and light layers are characterized by differing concentrations of Mn and Fe. We attribute the distribution of Mn and Fe to episodic hypolimnic oxic-anoxic variations. The age model suggests an approximately bidecadal timescale for the formation of each layer pair. We propose a new model of these redox changes with the SHWW variations. The most likely phenomenon to produce complete water-column mixing is thermobaric instability, which occurs in colder winters with low-intensity SHWW (El Nino-like conditions). In contrast, windier winters are characterized by higher temperatures and reduced mixing in the water column, facilitating a decline in oxygen concentration. Laminations, and the inferred presence of periodic hypolimnion redox changes, are common features of the past similar to 6.3 ka. Geochemical proxy variability is compatible with an intensification of El Nino/Southern Oscillation activity during the past similar to 2 ka.					; JIMENEZ-ESPEJO, Francisco J./F-4486-2016; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022; Jimenez-Espejo, Francisco/F-4486-2016; Neugebauer, Ina/AAG-2278-2020; Garcia-Alix, Antonio/H-2464-2011	Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; Dunbar, Robert/0000-0002-9728-5609; JIMENEZ-ESPEJO, Francisco J./0000-0002-0335-8580; Neugebauer, Ina/0000-0002-8612-6573; Mucciarone, David/0000-0003-4482-2463; Garcia-Alix, Antonio/0000-0002-1823-488X													0300-9483	1502-3885				JAN	2023	52	1					124	138		10.1111/bor.12600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12600		SEP 2022											WOS:000855005500001

During summer 2014, we made unique high-resolution simultaneous measurements of CH4 in the atmosphere above, and surface waters of, the Laptev and East Siberian Seas. Turbulence-driven sea-air fluxes along the ship's track were derived from these observations; an average diffusive flux of 2.99mgm(-2) d(-1) was calculated for the Laptev Sea and for the ice-free portions of the western East Siberian Sea, 3.80mgm(-2)d(-1). Although seafloor bubble plumes were observed at two locations in the study area, our calculations suggest that regionally, turbulence-driven diffusive flux alone accounts for the observed atmospheric CH4 enhancements, with only a local, limited role for bubble fluxes, in contrast to earlier reports. CH4 in subice seawater in certain areas suggests that a short-lived flux also occurs annually at ice-out.

Impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on body condition, survival, and site fidelity of nonbreeding Piping Plovers	CONDOR												The impact of habitat loss on shorebirds may be exacerbated by disturbance from human recreational use, which further reduces the amount of coastal habitat that is functionally available. This can have consequences for the condition of individual birds or for population processes, both of which should be considered in strategies to reduce conflict between shorebirds and recreational users of coastal habitat. Our objectives were to determine the associations between human recreational use, coastal habitat modifications, and Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) body condition and demography. We monitored banded Piping Plovers throughout their annual cycle to assess variation in body condition, true survival, and site fidelity related to disturbance regimes in 8 geographically proximate, nonbreeding areas along the southeastern Atlantic Coast of North America from 2012 to 2016. Piping Plovers in disturbed sites were 7% lighter than those in less disturbed sites. Additionally, true annual survival was lower in more disturbed areas. However, site fidelity was less influenced by disturbance than were body mass and survival. Movements away from specific nonbreeding areas were uncommon, regardless of disturbance regime, but individuals that moved to new wintering locations had high probabilities of annual survival (S = 0.80) relative to their site-faithful counterparts (S = 0.67). Associations among nonbreeding conditions, body condition, and demography highlight the importance of nonbreeding habitats to annual population dynamics of migratory species. Conservation strategies for Piping Plovers that focus solely on breeding season dynamics may not account for some of the mechanisms that influence demographic rates and population trajectories.

Though not connected to the world seas, Lake Pannon shows significant signs of relative lake level variations controlled by tectonics and climate changes. The incision surface of the Alpar canyon system is connected to SB Pa-4 (6.8 Ma sensu Vakarcs, 1997), earlier reported to represent a significant relative base-level fall in the basin, however, debated recently. Incised several hundred meters in the preexisting substrate, the individual canyon valleys of the Alpar canyon system are enormous in size and display a multi-story nature. They loose topographic expression headwards and basinward. Widths of individual valleys range from 5 to 10 km, with smaller tributaries. In the study area several adjacent canyon valleys can be seen on seismic profiles. The valley depth is greatest near their confluence, where a major trunk valley (600-700 m deep) was formed by eroding most of the Upper Miocene succession. The canyons are filled with clay marls. They are incised into an extremely thick aggrading deltaic complex and are overlain by fluvial sediments, suggesting a major transgression in between. The Late Miocene Alpar canyon system developed on the southern margin of the Mid-Hungarian Mobile Belt, the latter is characterized by NE-SW oriented fold axis and NE-SW oriented left lateral strike-slip faults. The canyon system coincides with a large releasing bend and/or extensional duplex of the Paks-Szolnok strike-slip system being active as sinistral during the late Miocene. Presumably, the formation of the deep canyons was generated by the close interaction of several factors and events in space and time, among them tectonic uplift forced relative base-level fall, the reactivation and bending/duplexing of a strike-slip fault system located near the coeval zone of the lake shoreline and shelf edge, and the possible change of sediment supply carried by overfed rivers.

This test consists in conveying into quarry lake, located in the recharge area of the alluvial fan, an additional volume of water through a channel. The increase in the volume of water in the lake, should result in a rapid increase in the availability of water in the aquifers. To verify the recharge efficacy a special monitoring network consisting of 20 measuring points, 5 of which are specially drilled, it has been implemented. In 9 of these points a data logger for the continuous measure of level, temperature and electric conductivity at 20 degrees C, it has been installed. A data logger has also been positioned in the channel from which the water flows into the lake. For about a month groundwater level was monitored prior to the recharge experiment. On 25 February 2014 managed aquifer recharge began and the volume of water flowing through the canal to lake until April 30, 2014, was approximately 600,000 m(3). In this period it was possible to observe that the intervention produces the expected effects, thus inducing an increase in the groundwater level which is maximum near the lake and decreases away from it. The rise in the water level of the lake has been rapid and substantial. Within the area of the lake have settled some protected bird species in need of a precise environmental balance for nesting; an excessive increase of the lake level could put at risk of flooding some nests present. The objective of the following phases of the study will be to calibrate an adequate water level of the lake, to the purposes of managed aquifer recharge and to maintain the existing ecosystem. At the moment, it was decided to stop the flow of water into the lake and then to re-set it at a lower flow rate. In the test area also falls a well field that is not currently used. It will be interesting to check in the future, in the event of a major withdrawal, the influence on the progress of the flow lines in conjunction with the managed aquifer recharge.					; Severi, Paolo/KCY-1907-2024	severi, paolo/0000-0003-0103-2162; 													1828-454X						2014	3	3			SI		49	54		10.7343/AS-083-14-0110	http://dx.doi.org/10.7343/AS-083-14-0110													WOS:000428696700007

J	Gioria, M; Osborne, BA				Gioria, Margherita; Osborne, Bruce A.			Biological Flora of the British Isles: Gunnera tinctoria	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Gunnera tinctoria (Molina) Mirb. (G. chilensis Lam.; G. scabra Ruix & Pav.; G. pilosa Kunth) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Gunnera tinctoria is a gynomonoecious, clonal, perennial herb that is naturalized in parts of Britain, becoming invasive in parts of Ireland and, more recently, Scotland. It occurs where winter temperatures are mild, and precipitation and humidity are high. Gunnera tinctoria is native to South America, predominantly in the Andean region of Chile and Colombia, and probably in parts of Argentina, ranging from sea level to c. 2000 m a.s.l. 3. Typical habitats in Britain and Ireland include stream and river banks, lake and pond margins, coastal cliffs, as well as disturbed areas, such as roadsides, quarries and ditches. In its native range it occurs predominantly on the banks of rivers and streams, on coastal cliffs and within canopy gaps or at the margins of temperate-humid rain forests. 4. Gunnera tinctoria occurs on a variety of substrates, mainly on alluvial or colluvial soils derived from volcanic material or on thin gley soils of marine origin. In Ireland, it occurs naturally on soils with a pH ranging from 4.6 to 6.2 and has been cultivated in soils with a pH up to 7. Soil moisture content and soil organic matter vary greatly, although it rarely colonizes highly organic soils such as peat. It is susceptible to even mild water deficits at all stages of development, and its seedlings are also sensitive to waterlogged conditions. 5. Gunnera tinctoria produces large numbers of seeds and also spreads clonally, by a horizontal rhizome system. It is wind pollinated, although insect pollination has been reported in New Zealand. Seeds are likely to be predominantly water and/or bird dispersed. In its invasive range, it can form a large and persistent soil seed bank. Recruitment from seeds seems to be important for its initial establishment, while vegetative propagation is the main means of expansion, leading to dense clonal stands. Long-distance seed dispersal seems to be central to the colonization of new areas, although the transport of vegetative propagules may also be important. 6. Gunnera tinctoria is a strong competitor in its invasive range, particularly in wet, humid environments. Its competitive ability arises from its large stature, the persistence of its seeds and rhizomes and a capacity for fixing nitrogen through a unique intracellular symbiosis with cyanobacteria (Nostoc) that may be particularly important for supporting the rapid growth of established plants early in the spring.

Equilibrium and non-equilibrium hypotheses have often been used to explain observations in community ecology. Published case studies have demonstrated that steady state phytoplankton assemblages are more likely to occur in deep lakes than in shallow mixed ones. 2. Phytoplankton seasonal succession was studied by weekly sampling in Faxinal Reservoir (S Brazil), a subtropical deep, clear, warm monomictic and slightly eutrophic reservoir. This study demonstrated an alternation of steady and non-steady state phases of phytoplankton assemblages with different dominant species during the steady states. 3. During the studied period, three steady states were identified with different dominant algal species: Anabaena crassa (Cyanobacteria), Nephrocytium sp. (green algae) and Asterionella (diatoms). 4. Each steady state in Faxinal Reservoir developed under stratified conditions of the water column according to the predictions of the disturbance concepts. Apparently, the major forces driving the development and persistence of these steady-state phases were closely related to thermal stratification and its consequences. 5. This study is the first report on development of more than one steady state within a year in a stratified water body. The development of three steady states might be the result of the relatively long stratification period in the Faxinal Reservoir and to its unique geochemical features.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF HYDROBIOLOGICAL PROCESSES DURING THE SPRING THERMAL BAR ON THE BASIS OF THE NUTRIENT PHYTOPLANKTON - ZOOPLANKTON MODEL	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-MATEMATIKA I MEKHANIKA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS												In this paper, a mathematical model for simulating the hydrodynamic and hydrobiological processes in a temperate water body during the evolution of the spring riverine thermal bar is described. A thermal bar is a narrow zone in a lake where the water, which has a maximum density, sinks from the surface to the bottom. Numerical simulation of the dynamics of plankton ecosystems in case of Kamloops Lake (British Columbia, Canada) is accomplished by using the nutrient - phytoplankton - zooplankton model of Franks et al. (1986). The hydrodynamic model, which includes the Coriolis force due to Earth's rotation, is written in the Boussinesq approximation with the continuity, momentum, energy, and salinity equations. Closure of the simultaneous equation system is performed with a two-parameter Wilcox k-omega turbulence model and algebraic relations for the coefficients of turbulent diffusion. The convection-diffusion equations are solved by a finite volume method to satisfy the integral conservation laws. The numerical algorithm for the flow and temperature fields' indication is based on a Crank Nicolson difference scheme. In the equations, the convective terms are approximated with the QUICK second-order upstream scheme. The systems of grid equations are solved by the under-relaxation method at each time step. The data from numerical experiments have shown qualitative agreement with results obtained by Holland et al. (2003). Simulations with the variable values of the concentrations of the biological components, coming from the Thompson River, have demonstrated that the high riverine nutrient concentrations do not play a significant role in dynamics of the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses; increasing of the phytoplankton in the river leads to a reduction of the nutrient at the location of the thermal bar, and the monotone growth of the riverine zooplankton incoming has a negative impact on the phytoplankton population.

J	Meierjohann, A; Brozinski, JM; Kronberg, L				Meierjohann, Axel; Brozinski, Jenny-Maria; Kronberg, Leif			Seasonal variation of pharmaceutical concentrations in a river/lake system in Eastern Finland	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												In this study, the concentrations of 15 pharmaceuticals were monitored during four seasons (February, May, July, and November 2010) along a 32 km stretch of a highly wastewater polluted watercourse (River Rakkolanjoki, Lake Haapajarvi) in Eastern Finland. The aim was to study the seasonal variation in the elimination of the pharmaceuticals and the stability of the compounds along the watercourse. The analysis was carried out using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method combined with extraction and preconcentration on HLB solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Pharmaceutical concentrations were determined at 9 points along the watercourse, and loads and removal of parent compounds were calculated using flow data from the discharge point and the last sampling point. The pharmaceuticals were found in concentrations ranging from low ng l(-1) to low mg l(-1) values at the discharge point and at concentrations of 0-556 ng l(-1) at the last sampling point. The rate of elimination of the pharmaceutical load was significantly higher in May and July than in February and November. There were clear differences in the stability of the individual compounds along the watercourse. Carbamazepine was not eliminated during any season, while ibuprofen, ketoprofen and sertraline were fully eliminated over the studied stretch of river during the summer months. Other compounds showed continuous elimination independent of the season, indicating different elimination paths, such as sorption, biodegradation and phototransformation, for the studied compounds.																			2050-7887	2050-7895					2016	18	3					342	349		10.1039/c5em00505a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5em00505a								26822330					WOS:000372249800006

Peak ciliate densities occurred at the oxic/anoxic interface; ciliate numbers then declined in an approximately exponential manner with increasing depth. Two thermally stratified 2 m high artificial lake ecosystems were constructed in which an anaerobic hypolimnion developed. Within these model lakes, populations of hypolimnetic ciliates were maintained for many months. Community structure, growth characteristics and spatial distribution of the ciliates were similar to those in the natural environment.																			0022-1287						1984	130	DEC					3113	3122																WOS:A1984TY91300007

Data were collected in east Tennessee during March through August of 1994-97. Water levels were not a major barrier to participation during the six-month period, but levels did affect the number of trips taken by anglers. Maintaining lakes at full pool for one additional summer month would result in an additional one-third trip per angler, or an additional 87,000 trips in the study region. The average net benefit of a full pool is $1.82 per angler, or an aggregate benefit of approximately $476,500 in the region.																			1068-5502					DEC	2000	25	2					520	532																WOS:000165156000011

The technique of atmospheric-pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometry provides online, in situ monitoring as well as chemical information about the arsenic species, identified as protonated trimethylarsine oxide (AsC3H10O+) and AsO(H2O)(n)(+) clusters (n = 0-4). Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the proposed cations are stable under atmospheric conditions. Our most remarkable discovery is that minimal arsenic appeared during spring 2011 until after the ground began to thaw, triggering a sharp increase in airborne arsenic levels as snowmelt flooded the soil with water and stimulated microbial activity. These findings reveal that volatile arsenic species, detected here as atmospheric ions, link the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic through air, soil, water, and living organisms.

Data Descriptor: A European Multi Lake Survey dataset of environmental variables, phytoplankton pigments and cyanotoxins	SCIENTIFIC DATA												Under ongoing climate change and increasing anthropogenic activity, which continuously challenge ecosystem resilience, an in-depth understanding of ecological processes is urgently needed. Lakes, as providers of numerous ecosystem services, face multiple stressors that threaten their functioning. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are a persistent problem resulting from nutrient pollution and climate-change induced stressors, like poor transparency, increased water temperature and enhanced stratification. Consistency in data collection and analysis methods is necessary to achieve fully comparable datasets and for statistical validity, avoiding issues linked to disparate data sources. The European Multi Lake Survey (EMLS) in summer 2015 was an initiative among scientists from 27 countries to collect and analyse lake physical, chemical and biological variables in a fully standardized manner. This database includes in-situ lake variables along with nutrient, pigment and cyanotoxin data of 369 lakes in Europe, which were centrally analysed in dedicated laboratories. Publishing the EMLS methods and dataset might inspire similar initiatives to study across large geographic areas that will contribute to better understanding lake responses in a changing environment.

PAEs, such as dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, were effectively removed at a 40 mg/L activated carbon dosage by emergency activated carbon treatment for excessive amounts of PAEs. The optimal BAC process parameters were an initial PAE concentration of 10 mu g/L and an empty bed contact time of 10 min. Results further showed that with higher summer temperatures, mature biofilms were formed, and CODMn, NH3-N and PAE removal efficiency tended to stabilize for approximately 1 month. During stable BAC operation, biodegradation was the primary mechanism.

J	Li, DY; Lai, XJ; Dong, ZC; Luo, XL				Li, Dayong; Lai, Xijun; Dong, Zengchuan; Luo, Xiaoli			Effects of the Three Gorges Project on the Environment of Poyang Lake	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Impounding by the Three Gorges Project (TGP) changed the hydrological process and affected the ecosystem in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Poyang Lake is closely linked with the Yangtze River. This paper presents a coupled numerical model designed for simulating the tempo-spatial variation of water quantity and quality in the lake's water system that features complex river-lake interactions. According to the calculated results of a typical year (2000) under two scenario schemes, we evaluated TGP's effects on the ecological environment of the lake. The results show that due to TGP impoundment, the hydraulic gradient at the lake outlet has increased and that the outflow fluctuates dynamically and regularly with the increase and decrease of the TGP released discharge. The lake water level falls in advance and the average reduction magnitude of the water level decreases progressively from north to south, showing a spatially uneven effect, which is 0.95 m, 0.70 m, 0.74 m, 0.35 m, and 0.80 m at Xingzi, Tangyin, Duchang, Kangshan, and Wucheng stations, respectively. The ammonia nitrogen output from the lake to the Yangtze River increases and the total ammonia nitrogen amount within the lake region decreases. The average ammonia nitrogen concentration within the lake region tends to increase slightly and the influence magnitude on the concentration is reduced from north to south. The wetland vegetation area fluctuates dynamically with the decline of the water level, and the increase of the wetland vegetation area ranges from 0.64 to 215.48 km(2). As a result of the falling water levels, the bottomlands in the lake region are exposed relatively earlier and the continuous exposure days increase, which intensifies the problem that migrant birds do not have enough food. Meanwhile the number of days when the bottomland and wetland are submerged decrease, which will further accelerate the degradation succession of wetland vegetation.

In seasonally ice-covered lakes, CH4 transported by ebullition (bubbling) from anoxic sediments gets trapped at the water-ice interface. If not oxidized by methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB), this can potentially lead to high episodic CH4 emissions at ice-melt. To understand the fate of CH4 trapped below ice, we measured depth-distributions of CH4 concentrations in the water column near bubbles trapped below ice in Lake Erken. We also performed a 21 d incubation experiment at low temperature (2.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C) to investigate the potential for CH4 oxidation. During most sampling occasions, we found steep CH4 concentration gradients just below the ice with a 13-fold decrease from the surface to a depth of 20 cm. In vitro incubations revealed that CH4 oxidation can occur at low temperatures typical for the water-ice interface. CH4 oxidation was observed as a significant decrease in CH4 concentration, a significant increase in stable isotope C-13 signature, and an increase in MOB during the incubation. Thus, CH4 accumulating in the top 20 cm of the water column, fed by diffusion from CH4 in trapped bubbles, may fuel significant CH4 oxidation. Since northern latitude lakes can be ice-covered for many months of the year and significant amounts of CH4 accumulate below the ice, the extent of CH4 oxidation under these low temperature-conditions is important for understanding the potential CH4 emissions to the atmosphere during ice-melt.

The influent and effluent mass loadings of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), suspended solid (SS), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of riparian wetland systems were monitored for nearly one year. In addition, influent and effluent samples of each riparian wetland treatment unit were collected and analyzed for nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and organic nitrogen) and phosphorus (organic phosphorus and phosphate). Results showed that the wetland systems removed various pollutants. There was a little seasonal change on the COD, SS, TN, and TP removal efficiency. There was no flow in the wetland during the winter. Therefore, the pollutant removal efficiency could not be determined. The nitrogen analysis results showed that ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were the main nitrogen species present in the influent and effluent of each wetland functioning unit. Information obtained from this study is helpful in providing a design basis for similar wetland systems to control agricultural non-point source pollution.

Nutrient concentrations in the water column and in bottom sediments were determined throughout seven seasonal sampling cruises from May 2003 to October 2004. Physicochemical parameters, such as transparency, temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen, were measured in situ in the water column using suitable equipment. Nutrient concentrations in bottom water were found generally higher than those in surface water. Nitrogen, mainly as nitrates, and phosphorus are released into the water column from the bottom sediments, especially during the summer period. Anoxia in the bottom water, as well as resuspension of the sediments are the main factors affecting nutrient internal loading in this lagoon. An approximate calculation showed that total phosphorus release was about 80 mg m(-2) d(-1) for the period March-August 2004. Vistonis Lagoon restoration will be possible only through the minimization or elimination of both external and internal nutrient loadings.

J	Lantz, TC; Kokelj, SV				Lantz, Trevor C.; Kokelj, Steven V.			Increasing rates of retrogressive thaw slump activity in the Mackenzie Delta region, NWT, Canada	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate warming at high latitudes may be contributing to the increase in areal extent of terrain disturbance associated with thawing permafrost. To evaluate change over time we analyzed historical temperature records and mapped retrogressive thaw slumps in the Mackenzie delta region using 1950, 1973 and 2004 aerial photographs. Here we show that rates of retrogressive thaw slump activity from 1973-2004 were significantly greater than during the preceding period (1950-1973) and suggest that these changes have occurred in response to a significant warming of annual and summer air temperatures during the period of record. In rolling, ice-rich terrain, the rate of thaw slump activity can be expected to increase with continued climate warming. The impacts of slumping on landscape evolution and soil and lake chemistry will likely magnify the direct effects of warming on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

J	NORMAN, FI; MUMFORD, L				NORMAN, FI; MUMFORD, L			STUDIES ON THE PURPLE SWAMPHEN, PORPHYRIO-PORPHYRIO, IN VICTORIA	AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Details are presented of gonad parameters and reproductive status, body measurements, molt, and food taken by purple swamphens collected in the Gippsland Lakes area between July 1971 and July 1973. Information from other studies is also discussed. Plant material (76% estimated average volume) dominated gizzard contents, particularly when inorganic material (23%) was discounted, and animal remains (.apprx. 1%) were found in only 51 of the 234 gizzards with food examined. Mostly semi-aquatic plants were eaten, predominately from Gramineae (59%), Cyperaceae (17%) and Hydrocharitaceae (11%), and Phragmites australis was the main species identified. The proportion of roots, rhizomes and tubers in gizzards increased in autumn samples. Monthly variations in the grit content of gizzards were significant; males (which were larger than females) held more large-sized fragments than females, and there was a moderate negative correlation between hard seeds and grit. Ovarian follicles were generally largest between July and Nov. and seminiferous tubule diameters in males increased from June and July to reach a maximum from Sept. to Nov., sperm were present from July to Nov. There were no simple correlations between gonad parameters and local rainfall in the preceding 30 days. The presence of a bursa of Fabricius did not successfully exclude reproductively active birds, but male swamphens with cloacal papillae and no bursa had larger testes than those with a bursa but no papillae. Color scores for bill and tarsus showed some seasonal variation in subsamples of males and females. Management of wetlands for this species must take account of its requirement for a relatively restricted range of food types.																			0310-7833						1985	12	2					263	278																WOS:A1985ALP1500015
J	BIMBER, DL; NIGRO, AA				BIMBER, DL; NIGRO, AA			THE SPRING SALMONID FISHERY NEAR A THERMAL DISCHARGE IN LAKE ERIE AT DUNKIRK HARBOR	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												A creel survey was conducted from March 10-April 30, 1977 in Dunkirk harbor located on the eastern shore of Lake Erie. Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) and brown trout (S. trutta) comprised 55% of angler harvest. Finclips indicated that 13.5% of coho salmon caught in the harbor were stocked in Ohio tributaries of the lake. Average catch per unit effort estimates for the salmonid part of the catch were 0.298 fish/h (pier) and 0.322 fish/h (boat) for successful salmonid anglers. The estimated total weight of the salmonid catch taken during the study was 610 kg.																			0030-0950						1982	82	4					193	195																WOS:A1982PK14700008

Cyanobacterial blooms in lakes frequently display high spatial heterogeneity, which may drive temporal changes in microbial community structure. Here we report on the spatial (horizontal and vertical) structure of the cyanobacteria community and of the co-occurring heterotroph microbial community during a major lake-wide bloom event at Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel). 2. We sampled the upper water layer (0, 1 and 5 m depths) at five locations across the lake, spatially representing north, south, east, west and centre of the lake, on two dates during winter 2016 when the Microcystis biomass was high. We aimed to characterise the spatial distribution of the bloom and the associated microbiota, as well as testing the extent to which variation in the structure of the microbial community could be associated with Microcystis biomass. 3. During the winter 2016 bloom, Microcystis biomass was spatially heterogeneous, but the Microcystis population structure was rather homogenous, dominated by a single genotype (ITS sequence variant). By contrast, the composition of the bacterial community, assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was spatially heterogeneous, differing between depths, sampling locations and time. 4. The largest difference in microbial community structure was between particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) fractions. The PA community was characterised by a relatively lower diversity, and dominated by Proteobacteria, whereas the FL community was significantly more diverse and dominated by members of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Variation in the microbial community was significantly correlated with geographical location and sampling depth. However, there was no clear relationship between the Microcystis biomass density (cells biovolume) and the structure of the microbial communities. 5. These results suggest that the structure of the bacterial community is partly decoupled from Microcystis population density, and potentially more affected by other environmental factors such as temperature and/or physicochemical conditions. Our study highlights the importance of spatial information on bloom composition and intensity in clarifying the factors affecting the progression of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and how this impacts their microbial counterparts.

J	Martinsen, KT; Kragh, T; Sand-Jensen, K				Martinsen, Kenneth Thoro; Kragh, Theis; Sand-Jensen, Kaj			Carbon dioxide fluxes of air-exposed sediments and desiccating ponds	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Ponds are active components of the global carbon cycle processing and emitting carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. These common habitats frequently experience seasonal water table variations resulting in periodically air-exposed sediments. However, the influence of these events on both the system scale carbon balance and in-pond environmental conditions remains poorly studied. We took advantage of an extraordinarily warm and dry summer to quantify the CO2 efflux from air-exposed sediments and water surfaces in desiccating ponds on oland, Sweden. Simultaneously, we modelled metabolism and measured environmental variables within the ponds. We found that air-exposed sediments had high CO2 effluxes greatly exceeding that from the water surfaces. Sediment water content influenced the temperature and strongly regulated the CO2 efflux gradually approaching zero as water evaporated. Within the desiccating ponds, respiration was generally higher than gross primary production, but was lower compared to the same ponds with higher water table. These findings highlight the role of periodically air-exposed pond sediments as sites of highly active carbon processes. Not only is this important for the system-scale carbon in ponds, but it may also influence the destiny of buried carbon in lakes subject to climate changes. The environmental conditions within desiccating ponds, most notably high water temperatures and poor oxygen conditions, further iterate the dynamics and extreme nature of ponds.

In lake models, one essential parameter is water clarity, parameterized via the light extinction coefficient, K-d, for which a global constant value is usually used. We used direct eddy covariance fluxes and basic meteorological measurements coupled with lake water temperature and clarity measurements from a boreal lake to estimate the performance of two lake models, LAKE and FLake. These models represent two 1-D modeling frameworks broadly used in NWP. The results show that the lake models are very sensitive to changes in K-d when it is lower than 0.5m(-1). The progress of thermal stratification depended strongly on K-d. In dark-water simulations the mixed layer was shallower, longwave and turbulent heat losses higher, and therefore the average water column temperatures lower than in clear-water simulations. Thus, changes in water clarity can also affect the onset of ice cover. The more complex LAKE modeled the seasonal thermocline deepening, whereas it remained virtually constant during summer in the FLake model. Both models overestimated the surface water temperatures by about 1 degrees C and latent heat flux by >30%, but the variations in heat storage and sensible heat flux were adequately simulated. Our results suggest that, at least for humic lakes, a lake-specific, but not time-depending, constant value for K-d can be used and that a global mapping of K-d would be most beneficial in regions with relatively clear lakes, e.g., in lakes at high altitudes.

Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at 350 m resolution was used to identify active fires locations. We focussed on a sequence of wildfires that affected the Sila mountain area during the summer of the 2017. This area of the Calabria region (southern Italy) was interested by a range of fires for the second half of July and the whole month of August ([1], [2]) due also to an extremely dry and hot summer We used a pair of optical images acquired from Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 July 2017 (pre-events) and 23 August 2017 (post-events). Firstly, we computed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for both images and calculated the difference between these two (dNDVI) at 10m resolution; the results put in evidence several areas characterized by vegetation reduction, with dNDVI values up to 0.3-0.4. Concerning the SAR data, we evaluated the coherence changes by exploiting two pairs of Sentinel-1 SAR data over the same area. Both pairs were acquired along descending orbit, respectively before (on July, 19th and 31st ) and after (on September, 5th and 17th ) the fires occurred in the Sila mountain area. The coherence was computed separately for the first (gamma(pre)) and the second pair (gamma(post)) and the difference gamma(post )- gamma(pre) was calculated. In this way, we evaluated the difference in coherence between September, i.e. post-fires, and July, i.e. prefires expecting a higher coherence after burning, due to the vegetation reduction. In several areas, the coherence seems to be consistent with the fire events showing increments up to 0.20-0.25. However, the increasing of coherence difference could also be due to other reasons such as the soil moisture variations in the proximity of lakes/rivers or the seasonal cultivation changes. Further analysis integrating more information such as the SAR amplitude signal and the cross-polarized backscattering coefficient will be conducted in order to better evaluate and discriminate any contributions.

J	Golder, D; Chattopadhyay, S				Golder, Debashree; Chattopadhyay, Sanjib			Interrelationship between physico-chemical characteristics of a tropical lake and their impact on biodiversity of planktons	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												The physicochemical parameters including temperature, pH, dissolved O-2, free CO2, total alkalinity, permanent hardness, salinity, transparency, specific conductivity, BOD, COD, phosphate and nitrate were studied in a tropical lake, called Bonhooghly Lake (situated at Baranagar, Kolkata) around the year 2014 and the correlation between the said parameters, as well as their impact on Biodiversity indices were made. There is stable increase of CO2 content in water from August (27.24 mg l(-1)) and afterwards due to decaying of plant materials. Therefore there is a slight fall of pH (7.1). Significant negative correlation (p<0.01) between pH and CO2 content was also obtained. It also shows a significant negative correlation with O-2 content as well. During February and March transparency of water falls significantly with the increase of algal bloom. It significantly decreases dissolved O-2 content and pH but increases free dissolved CO2 (p<0.01). Phosphate has a definite correlation with nitrate content of the Lake, possibly because both are among the most essential nutrients of living system. Increase of one obviously indicates escalation of other. During the early months of the year phosphate and nitrate content of water increased steadily (up to 0.13 and 1.85 mg 11 respectively) and a very high number of Chlamydomonas(up to 15100 1(-1)) and Chlorella (up to 13140 l(-1))were observed. Species richness indices (Menhinick's index) of Phytoplanktons were observed maximum in the month of May, dominance (Simpson's index) in January and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) in April. Zooplanktons also followed the same trend indicating close interdependence. It was significant that apart from other factors, temperature played a most pivotal role in bringing the diversity in the plankton community.																			0254-8704					NOV	2016	37	6					1281	1289											29257653					WOS:000389393000008
J	BELL, G; WOLFE, LM				BELL, G; WOLFE, LM			SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN A NATURAL-POPULATION OF HYDRA-PSEUDOLIGACTIS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Populations of H. pseudoligactis were censussed during 1980-1981 in a lake and a small pond in southern Quebec [Canada]. Both natural and artificial substrates (glass slides) were used. Population density rose during the early part of the season to a maximum in June-July, after which a decline in the rate of asexual budding drove density down. The decline in budding rate lagged .apprx. 2 wk behind the increase in density. High local population density on the glass slides reduced rates of budding and caused dispersal from crowded slides. Sexual individuals appeared in the middle of the growing season, near the time of maximal density, when rates of asexual budding had begun to fall. Sexual individuals were more frequent in the site where and in the year when budding rates were lower; 66% of the variance in the frequency of sexual individuals between dates in the pond was explained by variance in the number of buds borne by asexual individuals. These results are consistent with the interpretation of sexuality as a device to reduce competition between offspring in a spatially heterogeneous environment.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	4					851	856		10.1139/z85-126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-126													WOS:A1985AJG1500019

By using a mathematical model it was possible to calculate the speeds at which 2- and 4-celled colonies re-form into the 1-cell stage, and at which the cells are eliminated. The rate of cell production is generally 0.5-3 cells/parent cell per day and the elimination rate is nearly always of the same magnitude. All flow rates seem to be regulated mainly by water temperature and the effective light climate.																			0003-9136						1980	89	1-2					118	134																WOS:A1980KA38500009

The LGM culmination, LGM-b, lasted from about 21 to 17 ka and was followed by rapid deglaciation. This finding suggests a millennial-scale state with extreme glacial conditions (at least regionally) that immediately preceded the onset of full deglaciation marked by Heinrich event 1. In order to check how regional climate and vegetation in subtropical East Asia responded to the global-scale LGM culmination and the deglaciation onset, a new high-resolution pollen record from the Lijiafang peatland (LJF: 26 degrees 36.849'N, 116 degrees 08.463'E, 270 m) in Southeast China was generated. This record demonstrates a massive expansion of herbs during LGM-b. The dominance of herbaceous pollen suggests sparse forest cover in the lowlands of the subtropical East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) region and indicates an approximately 3300-year-long interval of the driest climate conditions of the entire last glacial-interglacial cycle. The LJF pollen-based reconstruction is consistent with the other vegetation records from the larger region, suggesting the climate change during LGM-b significantly impacted terrestrial ecosystems. The environmental change in the EASM region is likely linked to the Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) decrease that weakened the Walker cell convection over the western Pacific Ocean and reduced convection and moisture content in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The strengthened decrease in moisture supply during LGM-b seems to have resulted in extreme and widespread mega-droughts in the EASM and Australian regions. Our data indicate that the cold SSTs may have also decreased air temperatures in the neighboring parts of the continents. We suggest that the widespread SSTs decline in the western Pacific may have been linked to the cooling of the Southern Ocean and the expansion of Antarctic sea ice during LGM-b.

As one of the most distinct climatic events of the last 11.7 ka, it has been used to establish the formal boundary between the mid- and late-Holocene. Although the 4.2 ka event was not pronounced in East-Central Europe, its exact impact on the area has yet to be evaluated. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to reconstruct the functioning of the selected lake and terrestrial ecosystems from northern Poland around the time of the 4.2 ka event, and (2) to disentangle the drivers of the recorded environmental changes (local factors vs. climate impact). We studied the sedimentary record of Lake Spore, focusing on the period between 3.8 and 4.5 cal. ka BP using numerous biotic and abiotic proxies, such as chironomids, cladocerans, pollen and spores, delta C-13(org), delta N-1(5)org, delta O-18(carb), delta C-13(carb), TOC/N, Fe, S, LOI550, and LOI950. The chironomid-derived reconstruction of mean July air temperature did not change during the 4.2 ka event. Pollen accumulation rate (PAR) data showed lower pollen production of some tree taxa during the period 4.0-4.25 cal. ka BP that is consistent with low PARs recorded for the corresponding period in the sediments of nearby (similar to 75 km) Lake Suminko. This change might have occurred due to either regional-scale forest disturbance or cooler winters resulting from an exceptionally strong Siberian High during the 4.2 ka event. Distinct peaks of Fe and delta C-13(carb) at 4.2 cal. ka BP likely record a pulse of podzolization. Although soil transformation processes were common in East-Central Europe after ca. 5 cal. ka BP due to general climate cooling, they could have been enhanced at Lake Spore during the 4.2 ka event, if winters were more severe. The delta C-13(org), delta N-15(org), TOC/N and delta O-1(8)carb records point to a water level rise after 4.2 cal. ka BP that most likely resulted from soil transformation in the catchment, not a change in effective precipitation. The composition of the terrestrial vegetation and the lake fauna and flora remained largely unaffected by the 4.2 ka event.					; Lamentowicz, Mariusz/E-8784-2010; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020; Slowinski, Michal/B-6546-2011; Suchora, Magdalena/ABB-6762-2020; Słowiński, Michał/B-6546-2011; Joniak, Tomasz/K-5802-2019; Kołaczek, Piotr/HLX-2920-2023; Suchora, Magdalena/R-6910-2016; Pleskot, Krzysztof/HTQ-1814-2023; Kramkowski, Mateusz/HGC-8797-2022	Joniak, Tomasz/0000-0001-7395-1585; Kolaczek, Piotr/0000-0003-2552-8269; Slowinski, Michal/0000-0002-3011-2682; Kramkowski, Mateusz/0000-0001-8025-7815; Wozniak, Magdalena/0000-0002-1863-5122; Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Fojutowski, Michal/0000-0002-8171-355X; Suchora, Magdalena/0000-0002-3210-8492; Pleskot, Krzysztof/0000-0002-3724-1700; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2020	191								104565	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104565													WOS:000531077700008

For this purpose, we developed a method for raising a diary database in the colony, obtaining variables such as production, effort, catch per unit effort (CPUE), fishing spots, amongst others. We have identified two species of "pacu" - Mylossoma aureum and M. duriventre - with productions of 10.5 and 9.5 tonnes respectively which generated an income of U$ 22,173.00. Captures occurred mostly randomly, due to the region's fishing characteristics although the CPUE was higher when compared to bigger cities. We could also find evidence over their migratory cycles from a correlation between the catching sites and the period, where: i) during the falling water (May to July), the "pacus" start to leave the streams and concentrate in lakes; ii) during the dry season (August to October), the "pacus" perform a second migratory cycle, leaving streams and lakes and going to rivers; iii) finally, during the rising water, "pacus" once again move to small streams. The generated information can be used in fishing strategies in the region, reducing costs with inputs.

Our interpretation suggests an initially open landscape during the early Neolithic, surrounding a large palaeobay, developing into a dense Pistacia scrubland ca. 6700 cal BP. From about 4450 cal BP the landscape once again becomes open, coinciding with the start of the Bronze Age on the archipelago. This period is concurrent with increased climatic instability (between 4500 and 3700 cal BP) which is followed by a gradual decrease in summer moisture availability in the late Holocene. During the early Roman occupation period (1972-1730 cal BP) the landscape remains generally open with a moderate increase in Olea. This increase corresponds to archaeological evidence for olive oil production in the area, along with increases in cultivated crop taxa and associated ruderal species, as well as a rise in fire events. The Maltese archipelago provides important insight into vegetation, human impacts, and climatic changes in an island context during the Holocene.					; Marriner, Nick/AAA-3004-2019; Montade, Vincent/F-8198-2019; ANDRIEU-PONEL, Valerie/J-2818-2014	Gambin, Timmy/0000-0002-8404-2632; Marriner, Nick/0000-0002-7916-6059; Montade, Vincent/0000-0002-8518-2610; ANDRIEU-PONEL, Valerie/0000-0001-7044-967X													1814-9324	1814-9332					2016	12	2					273	297		10.5194/cp-12-273-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-273-2016													WOS:000371625400007

Microbial arsenite oxidation is catalyzed by either of two distantly related arsenite oxidases, referred to as AIO and ARX. The arx genes encoding ARX and its regulatory proteins were originally defined in the genomes of gammaproteobacteria isolated from an alkaline soda lake. The arx gene cluster has been identified in a limited number of bacteria, predominantly in gammaproteobacteria isolated from lakes characterized by high pH and high salinity. In the present study, a novel arsenite-oxidizing betaproteobacterium, strain M52, was isolated from a hot spring microbial mat. The strain oxidized arsenite under both microaerophilic and nitrate-reducing conditions at nearly neutral pH. Genome analysis revealed that the strain possesses the ant gene cluster in its genome and lacks genes encoding AIO. Inspection of the bacterial genomes available in the GenBank database revealed that the presence of this gene cluster is restricted to genomes of Proteobacteria, mainly in the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. In these genomes, the structure of the gene cluster was generally well-conserved, but genes for regulatory proteins were lacking in genomes of strains belonging to a specific lineage. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that ARX encoded in the genomes can be divided into three groups, and strain M52 belongs to a group specific for organisms living in low-salt environments. The ArxA protein encoded in the genome of strain M52 was characterized by the presence of a long insertion, which was specifically observed in the same group of ARX. In clone library analyses with a newly designed primer pair, a diverse ArxA sequence with a long insertion was detected in samples of lake water and hot spring microbial mat, characterized by low salinity and a nearly neutral pH. Among the isolated bacterial strains whose arsenite oxidation has been demonstrated, strain M52 is the first betaproteobacterium that possesses the arx genes, the first strain encoding ARX of the group specific for low-salt environments, and the first organism possessing the gene encoding ArxA with a long insertion.

J	Eckmann, R				Eckmann, R			Allocation of echo integrator output to small larval insect (Chaoborus sp.) and medium-sized (juvenile fish) targets	FISHERIES RESEARCH					International Workshop on Shallow Waters Fisheries Sonar	SEP 16-18, 1996	UNIV LONDON, ROYAL HOLLOWAY, INST ENVIRONM RES, EGHAM, ENGLAND	Royal Soc, Uk, BioSonics, Hydroacoust Technol, Environm Agcy, UK, SIMRAD Norge	UNIV LONDON, ROYAL HOLLOWAY, INST ENVIRONM RES			In acoustic sampling for fish, thresholding is normally applied to eliminate the unwanted contribution of noise to the integrator output. Since thresholding discriminates against small targets, this technique cannot be used for the quantitative study of these small targets in the presence of larger ones. When the integrator output (area backscattering coefficient, s(a)) due to one size class of targets is plotted vs. decreasing s(v)-threshold (volume backscattering strength) in 1 dB steps, the resulting curve can be described by an asymptotic Bertalanffy growth function. If the slope of the resulting curve decreases at some intermediate threshold level and then increases again before the final plateau is reached, the total integrator output can be allocated to two groups of targets according to the linearity principle in acoustics. The maximum s(a) value for the larger targets (s(a)-large) is estimated by fitting a Bertalanffy function to the lower part of the curve. The echo integral that corresponds to the smaller targets is then found by subtracting s(a)-large from the s(a) value that is reached at the lower threshold level. In a shallow (max. depth 8.5 m) mesotrophic lake of 24 ha surface area in northeastern Germany, this new technique was tested to estimate the abundance of insect (Chaoborus) larvae in spring. Hydroacoustic data were sampled during night, when juvenile roach occurred together with midge larvae in the pelagic zone. Chaoborus abundance was estimated by replicate vertical tows of a 1 m(2) plankton net of 0.5 mm mesh size. The s(a) values that were allocated to Chaoborus larvae were significantly correlated to mean Chaoborus abundance. This relationship was then used to map the lakewide distribution of Chaoborus larvae on two dates in spring.

The pool contained a strong side-to-side thermal gradient (8-15 degrees C) created by the confluence of Granite Creek (water temperature 15 degrees C) with Sullivan Springs, a much colder (8 degrees C) stream of comparable discharge. Juvenile bull trout chose the coldest water available (8-9 degrees C).

J	BURNHAM, RJ; WING, SL; PARKER, GG				BURNHAM, RJ; WING, SL; PARKER, GG			THE REFLECTION OF DECIDUOUS FOREST COMMUNITIES IN LEAF LITTER - IMPLICATIONS FOR AUTOCHTHONOUS LITTER ASSEMBLAGES FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD	PALEOBIOLOGY												To assess the degree to which forest litter reflects the source forest, three 1-ha plots of temperate deciduous forest were mapped and litter accumulating in these forests was sampled. Identity, position, and diameter of all stems 2 cm or larger diameter at breast height are known for each forest. Composition of the leaf litter is governed by two key factors: (1) abscised leaves are deposited primarily on the forest floor directly underneath the canopy that produced them, and (2) the leaf mass of a species is highly correlated with its stem cross-sectional area. These factors produce autochthonous litter samples that correspond closely in composition to the forest within a circle of canopy-height radius or less. Even relatively small litter samples (350 leaves) consistently contained all the common species in the local area. However, the rarer tree species were seldom recovered in the litter samples. Correlation coefficients for litter mass and basal area by species are typically over .80. These observations have three important implications for interpreting autochthonous compression-fossil assemblages. First, approximate relative abundances of locally dominant and subdominant forest taxa can be obtained from relatively small samples of autochthonous compression-fossil assemblages. Second, representation of rare forest species, even in large fossil samples, will be fortuitous. For this reason, complete species lists and consistent estimates of richness cannot be derived directly from most existing samples of autochthonous compression-fossil assemblages. Third, the strong tendency for leaves to fall beneath the canopy of the tree that sheds them suggests that properly sampled autochthonous fossil leaf assemblages may yield information on crown size of individual trees and the spatial distribution of individuals and species, aspects of vegetational structure that have been thought accessible only in well-preserved "fossil forests" with standing trunks.

A detailed understanding of relationship between water quality and land use is critical for effective land use management to improve water quality. Linear mixed effects and multiple regression models were applied to water quality data collected from 2003 to 2010 from 36 stations in the Huai River basin together with topography and climate data, to characterize the land use impacts on water quality and their spatial scale and seasonal dependence. The results indicated that the influence of land use categories on specific water quality parameter was multiple and varied with spatial scales and seasons. Land use exhibited strongest association with dissolved oxygen (DO) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations at entire watershed scale and with total phosphorus (TP) and fluoride concentrations at finer scales. However, the spatial scale, at which land use exerted strongest influence on instream chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels, varied with seasons. In addition, land use composition was responsible for the seasonal pattern observed in contaminant concentrations. COD, NH3-N, and fluoride generally peaked during dry seasons in highly urbanized regions and during rainy seasons in less urbanized regions. High proportion of agricultural and rural areas was associated with high nutrient contamination risk during spring. The results highlight the spatial scale and seasonal dependence of land use impacts on water quality and can provide scientific basis for scale-specific land management and seasonal contamination control.

A total of 75 taxa belonging mostly to Oligochaeta, Ephemeroptera, Chironomidae, and Mollusca were recorded. The most abundant were the invasive bivalve mollusks Dreissena sp., larvae of Ch. crystallinus and oligochaetes. The highest taxa diversity was recorded in the reservoirs located in close proximity to the Danube River and in the reservoirs with the largest areas. The occurrence and abundance of invasive Dreissena species, electrical conductivity, Ca2+ concentration and water transparency were identified as potential factors for the mactroinvertabrate distribution. Based on 7 macroinvertebrate metrics, the ecological potential of the reservoirs was assessed in the range from "Good" to "Bad". Most of the reservoirs were classified as having a "Moderate" ecological potential. It is recommended that the invasive alien species are considered in the use and development of macroinvetebrate metrics and assessment tools for lakes, and in the river basin and reservoir management strategies Immediate management actions are crucially needed to improve the ecological potential of reservoirs.					; Tyufekchieva, Violeta/HNI-2291-2023; Kenderov, Lyubomir/X-9497-2019; Vidinova, Yanka/K-2467-2019	Tyufekchieva, Violeta/0000-0001-9324-0430; Kenderov, Lyubomir/0000-0002-3027-4331; 													0324-0770					SEP	2013	65	3					337	348																WOS:000325676600010

The reservoir was built for reducing nutrients load to the Lake Balaton. Most of the surface of the reservoir is open and only the offshore region is covered by emergent vegetation. Four microhabitats dominated by reeds (principally Phragmites sp.), bulrushes (Typha sp.), sedges (Carex sp.) and weeds (Myriophyllum sp., Ceratophyllum sp. and Polygomum sp.). Spatial and temporal distribution of zooplankton were analysed since these habitats could be assumed as refuges for zooplankton from fish predation. The highest abundance of zooplankton were measured in the microhabitat dominated by sedges and rushes in summer and weeds;and reeds in all of other seasons. In this reservoir two main microhabitat types could be separated by the zooplankton community: emergent (composed of reeds, bulrushes and sedges) and submerged vegetation. Distribution of zooplankton species among microhabitats depends primarily on the texture, but not on the species composition of the vegetation.

Strong cyanobacterial blooms have contributed, among others, to the cessation of recreational use of this urban lake. Its sustainable restoration was started in autumn 2011. These treatments were a combination of three complementary methods: aeration with a pulverizing aerator, phosphorus inactivation with small doses of magnesium chloride and iron sulphate (<15 kg ha(-1)) and biomanipulation. These treatments were carried out for three years (2012-2014), and in the next two (2015-2016), treatments were limited from three to one method-aeration. The obtained effects (a decrease in the number of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton and at the same time an increase in its biodiversity, decrease in chlorophyll a concentration and improvement of transparency) were lost due to the cessation of phosphorus inactivation and biomanipulation. The biological balance was upset, which resulted in an increase in chlorophyll a concentration, the return of cyanobacteria dominance in the phytoplankton and a deterioration of water quality. Leaving only a pulverizing aerator active, to maintain low oxygen concentrations near the bottom zone was not sufficient to ensure a gradual improvement of water quality with quite a significant external load of nutrients.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018; Rosinska, Joanna/J-2864-2012	Kowalczewska-Madura, Katarzyna/0000-0003-0243-1085; Dondajewska-Pielka, Renata/0000-0002-6761-0669; Rosinska, Joanna/0000-0002-8443-7546; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161														2073-4441				MAY	2020	12	5							1383	10.3390/w12051383	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12051383													WOS:000555915200162
J	Mcandrews, JH; Turton, CL				Mcandrews, John H.; Turton, Charles L.			Canada geese dispersed cultigen pollen grains from prehistoric Iroquoian fields to Crawford Lake, Ontario, Canada	PALYNOLOGY												Crawford Lake, Ontario, Canada (43 degrees 28.1'N, 79 degrees 56.9'W, 278 mas]) has varved and AXIS dated sediments containing fossil pollen that record native Iroquoian farming ca. AD 1268 to 1520. From before AD 1000 to 1268, bioturbating organisms caused poor varve preservation but since then, well-preserved varves and dung pellets reflect anoxic bottom water due to meromixis. The onset of varve preservation coincides with the occurrences of pollen grains of Zea (maize), Helianthus (sunflower), Phaseolus (bean), Cucurbita (squash) and Portulaca (purslane), and spores of Ustilago cf. maydis (maize smut). These pollen grains and spores are more abundant in pellets between varve laminae than in the surrounding sediment matrix. Analyses of DNA from five pellets demonstrate that they are dung from wild Canada geese (Branta canadensis). In the autumn, as geese foraged in Iroquoian fields, they inadvertently ingested pollen and spores before flying to the lake. There they roosted and cast the pollen-rich dung pellets, which became part of the sediment. This study demonstrates that birds, wild geese and perhaps ducks, can be important vectors of pollen to lake sediments located near agricultural settlements.																			0191-6122						2007	31						9	18		10.2113/gspalynol.31.1.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gspalynol.31.1.9													WOS:000252435100005

In this experiment, four different dosages of calcium peroxide (CaO2) were adopted to study the control effects of nutrients release from the sediments in the simulated landscape waters. The results demonstrated that CaO2 addition could effectively improve the physicochemical properties and microbial composition in sediments, and an obvious improvement was achieved with a larger dosage. It was observed that the surface sediments of experiment groups were oxidized to form a capping barrier between the sediment and overlying water, which might cut off the pollutant diffusion in sediment. Meanwhile, CaO2 could decrease the nutrients concentration in water obviously, and the reduced effect was positively correlated with the CaO2 dosage. Compared with the nutrients release fluxes in CK (105.89 mg-TN m(-2) day(-1), 106.48 mg-NH4+-N m(-2) day(-1,) 4.14 mg-TP m(-2) day(-1), and 4.30 mg-SRP m(-2) day(-1)), the CaO2 dosages of 0.12 and 0.18 kg m(-2) could entirely inhibit the nutrients release from sediment, and partially reduce the original pollutants in the overlying water. However, 0.18 kg m(-2) CaO2 would cause a higher increase of pH value and NO2--N concentration, and bring potential risk to the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, 0.12 kg-CaO2 m(-2)-sediment was selected as the optimal dosage by considering the control effect, economic cost, and potential risk comprehensively. In general, this study provided a quantitative usage method of CaO2, which is convenient and effective to prevent or control the nutrients release from sediment caused by anoxic and reductive condition in summer.

Overall, the trace metal concentrations and Pb isotope compositions correlate with latitudinal position, since lichens retrieved north of latitude 60degreesN are characterized by low enrichment factors (EF) (mainly between 10 and 30) for heavy metals (i.e. Pb, Zn) and radiogenic Pb-206/Pb-207 isotope values (similar to1.170-1.180). Samples collected further south are characterized by higher EF for heavy metals and much lower Pb isotopic compositions (i.e. Pb-206/Pb-207 less than or equal to 1.150). Lichens retrieved in the immediate vicinity of major urban centers (i.e. Calgary, Alberta and Victoria, British Columbia) record distinct Pb isotopic values compared to the regional signal measured in adjacent (remote) samples. The total variation defined by the Pb isotopic compositions of the lichens may be attributed to the mixing of atmospheric particulates and aerosols derived from at least four end-member components, three anthropogenic and one natural. The latter is the predominant signal recorded in lichens retrieved north of 60degreesN, and is similar in Pb isotopic composition to a natural component identified in aerosols collected during the autumn season of 1994 at Alert (Canadian High Arctic). In contrast, samples collected further south reflect in-part mixing between Canadian and USA anthropogenic sources of atmospheric Pb. The third (unradiogenic) anthropogenic end-member most probably represents atmospheric emissions originating from one of the world's major Zn/Pb smelters located at Trail, British Columbia.

J	Notaro, M; Bennington, V; Lofgren, B				Notaro, Michael; Bennington, Val; Lofgren, Brent			Dynamical Downscaling-Based Projections of Great Lakes Water Levels	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Projections of regional climate, net basin supply (NBS), and water levels are developed for the mid- and late twenty-first century across the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Two state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) are dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model (RCM) interactively coupled to a one-dimensional lake model, and then a hydrologic routing model is forced with time series of perturbed NBS. The dynamical downscaling and coupling with a lake model to represent the Great Lakes create added value beyond the parent GCM in terms of simulated seasonal cycles of temperature, precipitation, and surface fluxes. However, limitations related to this rudimentary treatment of the Great Lakes result in warm summer biases in lake temperatures, excessive ice cover, and an abnormally early peak in lake evaporation. While the downscaling of both GCMs led to consistent projections of increases in annual air temperature, precipitation, and all NBS components (overlake precipitation, basinwide runoff, and lake evaporation), the resulting projected water level trends are opposite in sign. Clearly, it is not sufficient to correctly simulate the signs of the projected change in each NBS component; one must also account for their relative magnitudes. The potential risk of more frequent episodes of lake levels below the low water datum, a critical shipping threshold, is explored.

LIMNOLOGY	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												A wildfire in the early spring in the largely virgin forest of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area burned most of the coniferous watersheds of two lakes in largely granitic terrane. The chemical and biological limnology of the two lakes was followed for two years, starting immediately after the fire, and a third lake of comparable size nearby was used as a control. Results show that major ions, silica, and total nitrogen and phosphorus were not significantly different in the three lakes, implying that the runoff from the burned forest did not appreciably affect the two lakes in question. The same conclusion is reached from an analysis of algal biomass and phyotplankton composition.																			0003-9136					APR	1986	106	2					177	202																WOS:A1986C095000003

The goal of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of nutrient transformation processes on surface water quality, especially rivers in cold regions where ice-covered conditions persist for a substantial part of the year. We established a sensitivity analysis framework for water quality modelling and monitoring of rivers in cold regions using the Water Quality Analysis Program WASP7. The lower South Saskatchewan River in the interior of western Canada, from the Gardiner Dam at Lake Diefenbaker to the confluence of the North and South Saskatchewan rivers, is used as a test case for this purpose. The study reveals that parameter sensitivities differ between ice-covered and ice-free periods and biological model parameters related to nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics can still be sensitive during the ice-covered season. For example, sediment oxygen demand is an important parameter during the ice-on period, whereas parameters related to nitrification are more sensitive in the ice-off period. These results provide insight into important water quality monitoring aspects in cold regions during different seasons.

Nutrient Excretion Rates of Anadromous Alewives during Their Spawning Migration	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Excretion is one of the processes through which anadromous fishes move marine-derived nutrients into freshwater ecosystems, but no direct estimates of nutrient excretion rates by anadromous fish exist. We estimated the mass-specific nutrient excretion rates of anadromous alewives Alosa pseudoharengus during their spring spawning migration into Bride Lake, Connecticut. Anadromous alewives excreted an average of 2.17 mu g of phosphorus per gram of wet fish mass per hour and 24.71 mu g of nitrogen. The mean N:P ratio (by mass) of nutrient excretion was 11.7. Most of the nitrogen excreted was in the form of NH(4)(+). Our results suggest that excretion by anadromous fish can affect local food webs and ecosystem function when ecosystems are relatively small and fish aggregate at high densities, such as at the peak of the spawning run.					; Post, David/A-6987-2009	Walters, Annika/0000-0002-8638-6682; Post, David/0000-0003-1434-7729													0002-8487					MAR	2009	138	2					264	268		10.1577/T08-111.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T08-111.1													WOS:000268501000003

Earthquake location result shows that these earthquakes mainly occurred near the Tianchl caldera. Almost all swarms were concentrated at southwest of the caldera, and no swarms occurred in northeast area where earthquakes densely concentrated. In other seasons, the permanent station CBS is the only seismic station to monitor volcanic earthquakes in Tianchi volcano. Waveform correlation analysis of seismic data recorded at CBS in different time shows that earthquake swarms occurred in other seasons also concentrated in the southwest Tianchi Lake. High-precision relative location shows that hypocenters of earthquake swarm distributed along northwest with a dip angle of 80 degrees to southwest. During the July 13, 2003 earthquake swarm the hypocenters migrated from deep to shallow and deeper events had upward first motion directions at almost all stations. That means they had obvious expansion component in source mechanism. Taking into account of significant surface deformation in Changbaishan Tianchi volcano since 2002, geochemical anomalies and harmonic-spectral earthquakes, we believe that the earthquake swarm activity was caused by magmatic and hydrothermal activity and pressure increase of magma near the depth of 5 km.

Total floristic similarity between the neighbouring mountain sytems (100 km apart) was only 22.74%. One of the sites has been influenced by glaciation, while the other contained habitats that served as glacial refugia.

First evidence of free-living Naegleria species in recreational lakes of Alberta, Canada	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Rising temperatures are increasing environmental habitats for thermotolerant pathogens, such as the so-called 'brain-eating amoeba', Naegleria fowleri. To the best of our knowledge, however, Naegleria species have not been reported in environmental water sources in Canada. We surveyed popular recreational lakes in Alberta, Canada during the summer bathing period to determine the presence or absence of Naegleria species. While N. fowleri was not isolated in this study, we identified other thermotolerant species, including Naegleria pagei, Naegleria gruberi, Naegleria jejuensis and Naegleria fultoni using culture-based methods, hence indicating the potential conditions to support N. fowleri.

J	Howard, J; Merrifield, M				Howard, Jeanette; Merrifield, Matt			Mapping Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems in California	PLOS ONE												Background: Most groundwater conservation and management efforts focus on protecting groundwater for drinking water and for other human uses with little understanding or focus on the ecosystems that depend on groundwater. However, groundwater plays an integral role in sustaining certain types of aquatic, terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, and their associated landscapes. Our aim was to illuminate the connection between groundwater and surface ecosystems by identifying and mapping the distribution of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in California. Methodology/Principal Findings: To locate where groundwater flow sustains ecosystems we identified and mapped groundwater dependent ecosystems using a GIS. We developed an index of groundwater dependency by analyzing geospatial data for three ecosystem types that depend on groundwater: (1) springs and seeps; (2) wetlands and associated vegetation alliances; and (3) stream discharge from groundwater sources (baseflow index). Each variable was summarized at the scale of a small watershed (Hydrologic Unit Code-12; mean size = 9,570 ha; n = 4,621), and then stratified and summarized to 10 regions of relative homogeneity in terms of hydrologic, ecologic and climatic conditions. We found that groundwater dependent ecosystems are widely, although unevenly, distributed across California. Although different types of GDEs are clustered more densely in certain areas of the state, watersheds with multiple types of GDEs are found in both humid (e. g. coastal) and more arid regions. Springs are most densely concentrated in the North Coast and North Lahontan, whereas groundwater dependent wetlands and associated vegetation alliances are concentrated in the North and South Lahontan and Sacramento River hydrologic regions. The percentage of land area where stream discharge is most dependent on groundwater is found in the North Coast, Sacramento River and Tulare Lake regions. GDE clusters are located at the highest percentage in the North Coast (an area of the highest annual rainfall totals), North Lahontan (an arid, high desert climate with low annual rainfall), and Sacramento River hydrologic regions. That GDEs occur in such distinct climatic and hydrologic settings reveals the widespread distribution of these ecosystems. Conclusions/Significance: Protection and management of groundwater-dependent ecosystems are hindered by lack of information on their diversity, abundance and location. By developing a methodology that uses existing datasets to locate GDEs, this assessment addresses that knowledge gap. We report here on the application of this method across California, but believe the method can be expanded to regions where spatial data exist.																			1932-6203					JUN 23	2010	5	6							e11249	10.1371/journal.pone.0011249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011249								20585640					WOS:000279135400011

A comparison of two different time-periods (1902 to 1992 versus 1920 to 1980) revealed that the lake restoration programme since 1982 has had a significant impact on the formation of the seasonal layers. Results of the partitioning of the variance in the varve thickness measures showed that about two thirds of the variance are unexplained by a climate and trophic state model and that trophic state explains 6%, whereas climate accounts for about 28% of the variance before the effect of lake restoration had a strong impact on the varves. Among the climate parameters the amount of annual precipitation is a strong predictor for explaining the thickness of both dark layer and total couplet thickness, whereas summer precipitation is important for the thickness of the light layer.

In the rest of the year, the ice cover shields the light and inhibits the photochemical processes in the water columns. Previous work has shown that chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in these lakes is very reactive photo chemically. A model assessment is here provided of lake-water photoreactivity in field conditions, based on experimental data of lake water absorption spectra, chemistry and photochemistry obtained previously, taking into account the water depth and the irradiation conditions of the Antarctic summer. The chosen sample contaminants were the solar filter benzophenone-3, and the antimicrobial agent triclosan, which have very well known photoreactivity and have been found in a variety of environmental matrices in the Antarctic continent. The two compounds would have a half-life time of just a few days or less in the lake water during the Antarctic summertime, largely due to reaction with CDOM triplet states ((CDOM)-C-3*). In general, pollutants that occur in the ice and could be released to lake water upon ice melting (around or soon after the December solstice) would be quickly photodegraded if they undergo fast reaction with (CDOM)-C-3*. With some compounds, the important (CDOM)-C-3* reactions might favour the production of harmful secondary pollutants, such as 2,8-dichlorodibenzodioxin from the basic (anionic) form of triclosan.

Three-dimensional bluff evolution in response to seasonal fluctuations in Great Lakes water levels	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Effects of lake level fluctuations on coastal bluff erosion in the Great Lakes are pervasive and of significant concern to policy-makers and property owners. Previous studies of bluff erosion have primarily estimated two-dimensional bluff recession rates over years to decades. However, bluff erosion is an irregular process in time and space so averaging coarse resolution observations over long time periods may neglect important processes driving erosion. To address this we use photogrammetric surveys of a Lake Michigan bluff to create four high resolution (10 cm) digital elevation models (DEMs) that span one year with images collected from small unoccupied aerial systems (sUAS). The elevation models were differenced to compare variations in sediment loss to modelled time-series of wave data, atmospheric temperature and lake level. The sub-annual erosion rates calculated from sUAS surveys were compared to longterm recession rates obtained by digitizing historic aerial imagery. The rate of erosion of the bluffs is a time dependent function of two factors: (1) the supply of sediment to lower regions on the bluffs from mass wasting and (2) increased wave erosion resulting from above-average lake levels and intensified onshore wave energy. These factors combine in the early spring when wave energy is elevated and atmospheric temperatures increase, causing reduction in bluff sediment strength by thawing, as well as an increase in porewater pressure from snow melt. Most importantly, above-average lake levels sustained in the longer term (multiple years) are required for the combination of (1) and (2) to result in substantial bluff erosion.

Of the ~370 bird species in this country, approximately 40% are wetland-dependent and most are migratory. Knowledge of bird use of Cuba's wetlands is critical for regional conservation. This study characterized waterbird assemblages in Cuban south coastal wetlands, reports spatio-temporal variations in waterbird diversity and suggests conservation strategies. We conducted 543 surveys across six wetlands (2011-2013). We recorded 110 species. Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors) and Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla) were the dominant species. The site with the highest richness and waterbird abundance was Humedal Sur de Los Palacios. Differences in waterbird composition were identified among sites and seasons but not among years. No differences were found in spatial or temporal variability in abundance among sites, seasons or years. Assemblage composition was not spatially dependent on the location of wetlands. Twelve species were at abundance levels exceeding 1% of their estimated global population. This study highlights the global importance of the Cuban south coast to waterbird conservation, particularly during fall migration and the uniqueness of Humedal Sur de Los Palacios. We encourage creation of new Ramsar sites, an Important Bird Area and a new protected area.					; Manica, Lilian/M-6222-2016	Aguilar Mugica, Susana/0000-0002-2638-6090; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2020	40	2					407	419		10.1007/s13157-019-01178-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-019-01178-3													WOS:000538546400016

Water Resources of Serbia and Its Utilization	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN BALKAN COUNTRIES	Springer Water											Serbia is landlocked country with territory of 88,361 km(2) primarily draining through the Danube River/Black Sea Basin. The rivers Tisa, Sava and Velika Morava are three significant tributaries flowing into the Danube River on the territory of Serbia. The dominant natural conditions influencing water resources in the country include characteristics of moderately continental climate, with average monthly air temperature ranging from 0 degrees C in the winter to 23 degrees C in the summer, and average annual precipitation sum of 720 mm. The relief changes from mountaneous forms in the south, east and west, over hilly-mountaneous in the central part surrounding the Morava River valleys, to the plain in the north of the country. Geological structure of Serbia is distinctively complex, predominant automorphic soils quickly drain excess water, and forest land is present on one third of the territory with deciduous trees as prevailing forest type. Such natural conditions provide for the average river network density of 747 m/km(2), a few natural lakes from the most famous Palic (5.6 km(2)) to a tiny karstic lake Vrmdza, and groundwater accumulation estimated to potentially utilizable 67 m(3)/s. The primary water resources utilization sectors in the country are water supply and hydro-power production. Water supply for population and industry is currently distributed from numerous local groundwater and surface water sources, together with 18 regional water supply systems. Hydropower provides for almost one third of the total electricity production in Serbia, with lead hydropower plant being Djerdap I on the Danube River. Irrigation in agriculture holds great, yet insufficiently utilized potential, because the soil and climatic conditions favour many cereals, industrial and fodder plants, fruits and vegetables. In this sector, with present water consumption of 1,600 m(3)/ha per year Serbia is behind its neighbouring countries. The same stands for water transport, present up to 5% in the total load transport in Serbia nowadays. However, the traffic of passengers and the number of cruise ships have been steadily increasing in the last two decades. Tourism, sports and recreation on rivers and lakes, together with spa tourism play an important role in the overall tourist offer of the country. Also, a promising sector in water utilization in Serbia is fish farming, which together with catch in fishing waters satisfy almost 1/2 of the domestic needs. The chapter describes legislation, regulatory and institutional framework for water utilization, and provides the detailed data and information about natural conditions, as well as the latest monitoring data on water resources quantity and quality significant for water utilization in Serbia. The data and information are mapped and many indicators crucial for understanding commercial, economic and other activities related to water utilization are presented.					; Langović, Marko/KCX-9362-2024; Dragicevic, Slavoljub/K-8986-2017	Zivkovic, Nenad/0000-0002-2731-2835; Novkovic, Ivan/0000-0002-1706-0451; Dragicevic, Slavoljub/0000-0002-1417-5405; Langovic, Marko/0000-0002-4614-7265													2364-6934	2364-8198	978-3-030-22468-4; 978-3-030-22467-7				2020							213	247		10.1007/978-3-030-22468-4_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-22468-4_9	10.1007/978-3-030-22468-4												WOS:000647072300010

Here, we comprehensively investigated the occurrence, distribution and risk assessment of representative antibiotics in a large drinking water reservoir (Fengshuba Reservoir, China). The total concentrations of antibiotics in the water phase, porewater phase, sediment phase and soil phase (drawdown area) were in the ranges of 195-569 ng/L, 47.1-333 ng/L, 114-272 mu g/kg and 2.84-77.2 mu g/kg, respectively. The dominant antibiotic was CIP in both the water and porewater phases, while it was OTC in the sediment phase. For the water phase, seasonal factor consisting hydrologic condition and pattern of antibiotic use could influence the occurrence level and environmental fate of antibiotics. In contrast, exogenous particles derived from the soils that had used manures during the spring planting season coupled with heavy rainfall was responsible for the occurrence level and composition of antibiotics in the sediment phase. Moreover, Chl-alpha, NO3-,TP and EC were the most dominant factor influencing the antibiotic distributions in the water phase, porewater phase, sediment phase and soil phase, respectively. Pseudo-partitioning coefficients indicated that PENV and PENG might accumulate more easily into the sediments from the aqueous phase compared with other antibiotics.

First surface velocity maps for glaciers of Monte Tronador, North Patagonian Andes, derived from sequential Pleiades satellite images	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We apply cross-correlation to Pleiades satellite images to generate accurate, high-resolution monthly surface velocity maps of Monte Tronador glaciers between March and June 2012. Measured surface displacements cover periods as short as 19 days, with a precision of similar to 0.58 m (11 m a(-1)). These glaciers follow a radial flow pattern, with maximum surface speeds of similar to 390 m a(-1) associated with steep icefalls. The lower reaches of the debris-covered tongues of Verde and Casa Pangue glaciers are almost stagnant, whereas Ventisquero Negro, another debris-covered glacier, shows acceleration at the front due to calving into a proglacial lake. Low-elevation debris-covered glacier tongues show increasing velocities at the beginning of the accumulation season, whereas higher-elevation, clean-ice tongues reduce their speed during this period. This contrasting behavior is probably in response to an increase in water input to the subglacial system from winter rainfall events at low elevations and a decrease in meltwater production at higher elevations. These sequential velocity maps can help to identify the controls on glacier surface velocity, aid in the delimitation of ice divides and could also contribute to more realistic calibration of ice-flux-mass-balance models in this glacierized area.					; Pitte, Pierre/GLT-9746-2022; Berthier, Etienne/B-8900-2009	Ruiz, Lucas/0000-0002-8837-436X; Villalba, Ricardo/0000-0001-8183-0310; Pitte, Pierre/0000-0001-5625-8287; Masiokas, Mariano/0009-0007-1437-415X; Berthier, Etienne/0000-0001-5978-9155													0022-1430	1727-5652					2015	61	229					908	922		10.3189/2015JoG14J134	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2015JoG14J134													WOS:000366345000008

From 1994 through 2009, we noted a significant increase in the number of algal blooms reported each year (P 0.001). There was also an increase in the number of blooms in which cyanobacteria were dominant (P 0.001), with these samples making up 50% of the total during peak years. The most common taxa of cyanobacteria identified were Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Microcystis, Gloeotrichia, and various Oscillatoriales. The remaining samples were dominated by filamentous green algae, or occasionally by chrysophytes. We also noted geographic and seasonal trends in the bloom reports. Most of the increase in the number of cyanobacterial bloom reports was accounted for from lakes on the Canadian Shield (located within the boundary of the Ministry's Northern Region). Algal blooms are now being reported later into the fall than they were during the 1990s; bloom reports have extended well into November in recent years. We attributed these trends to (1) increased nutrient inputs in some areas, which promote the growth of algae; (2) factors associated with climate warming, which may exacerbate bloom conditions; and (3) an increase in public awareness of algal issues. An increase in algal bloom reports is a management issue in Ontario, and blooms of potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria prompted a formal response protocol to be followed.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2011	27	2					107	114	PII 936032341	10.1080/07438141.2011.557765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2011.557765													WOS:000291853900001

Seasonal variation in physicochemical properties of coastal waters of Kalpakkam, east coast of India with special emphasis on nutrients	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study pertaining to the seasonal variation in physicochemical properties of the coastal waters was carried out at Kalpakkam coast for a period of 1 year (February 2006 to January 2007). It revealed that the coastal water was significantly influenced by freshwater input during North East (NE) monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Concentration of all the nutrients and dissolved oxygen (DO) was relatively high during the NE monsoon, whereas, salinity and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) were at their minimum level during this period. Phytoplankton production peak was observed in summer during which a typical marine condition prevailed. The present observed values of nitrate, phosphate, silicate, and turbidity are significantly high (five to ten times) compared to that of the pre-Tsunami period from this coast. Relatively low DO and chl-a concentration was noticed during the post-Tsunami period. A notable feature of this study is that though nutrient concentration in the coastal waters during post-Tsunami period has increased significantly, turbidity, the most single dominating factor, was found to adversely affect the phytoplankton production during post-Tsunami period as reflected by relatively low chl-a concentration. Thus, the post-Tsunami period may result in a change in coastal biodiversity pattern concomitant with change in coastal water quality.

The samples were analyzed for water-soluble inorganic ions, elemental composition of atmospheric aerosol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We found that the local emissions play an important role in the formation of the aerosol composition in Ulaanbaatar and Sukhbaatar. Polluting anthropogenic components arrive in Mongolia primarily from the southern and southeastern directions, originating in China. This observation is supported by simulations of the air mass pathways with the HYSPLIT model. The major ions in the aerosol particles in Sainshand and Baruun-Urt are SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ and, in certain cases, HCO3- and Ca2+ ions as well. The concentration of water-soluble ions in particulate matter with diameters less than 10 mu m (PM10) at these points in the absence of transport from the southern direction does not exceed 10 mu gm(-3). The concentration of ions in PM10 aerosols in Sainshand and Baruun-Urt increases to 20.3 mu gm(-3) under the influence of the southern transport pathways, a level comparable to the concentration of aerosols in the industrial cities of Mongolia, such as Ulaanbaatar. In Ulaanbaatar and Sukhbaatar the SO42-, NO3-, HCO3-,Ca-2(+), and NH4+ ions are the main components of PM10. This study was the first to investigate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of atmospheric aerosols from the Mongolian Gobi. The results showed that all aerosol samples were dominated by PAHs with five or six benzene rings, and the total concentration of PAHs in the aerosol particles was less than 3 ng m(-3). The concentration of PAHs in the Mongolian Gobi is several times higher than that in the air near the Baikal Lake due to the transport of anthropogenic emissions from China to Mongolia.

Lake Erie hypoxia spatial and temporal dynamics present challenges for assessing progress toward water quality goals	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Seasonal hypolimnetic hypoxia has been documented in Lake Erie's central basin since the 1950s. Shipbased surveys to monitor hypoxia have been conducted since the 1980s, but they occur at a relatively low frequency and focus on the deeper areas of the central basin. To better document the seasonal development of stratification and the consequent occurrence of hypoxia, we deployed eight moorings, in both nearshore-shallow areas and offshore-deep areas of the central basin, equipped with temperature and oxygen sensors at multiple depths, that recorded temperature and oxygen concentrations every 10 min. Results from 2017 to 2019 reveal that hypoxia occurs as early as July in the shallower areas west of, and around the southern perimeter of the central basin, but does not occur until August or September in the deeper central basin. Hypoxia is intermittent in the shallower perimeter areas; whereas in the deeper areas, hypoxia can persist into October, often progressing to anoxia. The intra- and inter-annual differences in the spatial and temporal extent of hypoxia indicate that an extensive monitoring program will be necessary to more accurately assess progress toward reducing the extent of hypoxia pursuant to the lake ecosystem objectives of the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

IN LAKE ONTARIO WETLANDS	WETLANDS												Wetlands of the Great Lakes region are increasingly dominated by invasive cattails (Typha angustifolia and Typha X glauca) which form dense stands of live and dead biomass that may reduce plant diversity. We hypothesized that differences in plant litter accumulation explain cattail dominance under certain hydrologic regimes related to wetland hydrogeologic setting. We investigated cattail abundance, litter accumulation, and species density in three bayside wetlands hydrologically connected and three protected wetlands hydrologically isolated from Lake Ontario. Mean litter biomass was higher in bayside wetlands (1.7-2.6 vs. 0.4-1.2 kg/m(2)) and negatively related to species density (p = 0.004) in both settings. A litter addition experiment demonstrated that fallen litter negatively influenced seedling survival (p = 0.061) and species density (p = 0.024). Decomposition rates accounted only partially for higher overall litter accumulation in bayside wetlands. Growing season water levels in bayside wetlands tracked Lake Ontario levels and showed less variation than protected wetlands. More stable water levels and higher density of standing dead stems in bayside wetlands may limit litter fragmentation, resulting in greater litter accumulation. Thus, anthropogenic and natural factors affecting cattail litter production, fragmentation, and decomposition could influence species diversity in coastal wetlands.

J	Uchida, Y; Inoue, M				Uchida, Yuki; Inoue, Mikio			Fish species richness in spring-fed ponds: effects of habitat size versus isolation in temporally variable environments	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Species richness in a habitat patch is determined by immigration (regional) and extinction (local) processes, and understanding their relative importance is crucial for conservation of biodiversity. In this study, we applied the Island Biogeography concept to spring ponds connected to a river in southwestern Japan to examine how immigration and extinction processes interact to determine fish species richness in temporally variable environments. 2. Fish censuses were conducted 15 times in 13 study ponds at 1-4 month intervals from August 1998 through October 2000. Effects of habitat size (pond area), isolation (distance from the river) and temporal environmental variability (water level fluctuation) on (i) species richness, (ii) immigration and extinction rates and (iii) population size and persistence of each fish species were assessed. 3. The results revealed predominant effects of distance on species richness, immigration/extinction rates and population size and persistence. Species richness decreased with increasing distance but was not related to either pond area or water level fluctuation. A negative effect of distance on immigration rate was detected, while neither pond area nor water level fluctuation had significant effects on extinction rate. Further, population size and persistence of four species increased with decreasing distance, suggesting that, in ponds close to the river, immigrants from the river reduce the probability of extinction (i. e. provide a rescue effect), contributing to the maintenance of high species richness. 4. Overall results emphasise the importance of immigration processes, rather than extinction, in shaping patterns of species richness in our system. The predominant importance of immigration was probably because of (i) high temporal variability that negates habitat-size effects and (ii) continuous immigration that easily compensates for local extinctions. Our results suggest that consideration of regional factors (e. g. connectivity, locations of source populations and barriers to colonisation) is crucial for conservation and restoration of local habitats.																			0046-5070					MAY	2010	55	5					983	994		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02335.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02335.x													WOS:000276655200005

Detecting the effect of water level fluctuations on water quality impacting endangered fish in a shallow, hypereutrophic lake using long-term monitoring data	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Water level fluctuations (WLFs) affect phytoplankton dynamics, water quality, and fish populations in lakes and reservoirs around the world. However, such effects are system-specific and vary due to interactions with other external factors such as solar radiation, air temperature, wind, and external phosphorus loading. Utilizing data from a long-term monitoring program (1990-2016), we developed an approach using cross-tabulation contour and conditional probability analyses to detect the effects of WLFs on the frequency of poor water quality impacting native fish in a large, shallow, hypereutrophic lake. Through the incorporation of long-term inter-annual and seasonal variability in climatic factors and cyanobacterial bloom periodicity, our approach detected non-linear WLF effects whereby both high and low-lake levels were associated with higher probabilities of poor water quality conditions stressful to fish including high pH, high un-ionized ammonia, and low dissolved oxygen. Although lake level management may not prevent poor water quality in any given year due to other external factors such as temperature or wind, we determined that seasonally based intermediate lake levels bracketing the long-term median afforded the best water quality conditions for endangered fish during the summer period when poor water quality is most common.

By 1984 this species had been found in tributaries of Lakes Huron and Michigan, and in the open waters of both lakes. All specimens indentified were the completely plated morph that is most prevalent in fresh water along the east coast of North America. The status of this species in Lakes Huron and Michigan appears to be "Possibly Established."

The use of repeated digital photography provides an opportunity to conduct long-term monitoring of plant phenology and to extract phenological transition dates. Here, we tracked the phenological changes in the flowering tree, Elaeagnus angustifolia L., in the Cherigele (CRGL) of the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) and the nearby Lianggejing (LGJ); using one-year near-surface digital repeat photography and meteorological data, the phenological difference between the two sites was revealed. We found that the use of digital cameras allowed for the monitoring of plant phenology with high temporal and spatial accuracy in these dryland ecosystems. Furthermore, in the lake group region of BJD, the onset of greening occurred 23 days earlier, the onset of dormancy began 13 days later and the growing season was 36 days longer, compared to those of the surrounding area. This difference is partly related to the higher altitude in the LGJ; however, it is dominantly related to the warm island effect in the lake group region. This effect resulted in the mean annual temperature in the CRGL being similar to 1.6 degrees C higher than in the LGJ.

J	Auer, B; Elzer, U; Arndt, H				Auer, B; Elzer, U; Arndt, H			Comparison of pelagic food webs in lakes along a trophic gradient and with seasonal aspects: influence of resource and predation	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Composition and seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton, bacteria, and zooplankton (including heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, rotifers and crustaceans) were studied in 55 lakes in Northern Germany with different trophic status, ranging from mesotrophic to hypertrophic. Mean abundance and biomass of all groups increased significantly with trophic level of the lake, but bacteria and metazooplankton showed only a weak correlation and a slight increase with chlorophyll concentration. Composition of phytoplankton showed a dominance of cyanobacteria in hypertrophic lakes, whereas the importance of chrysophytes and dinophytes decreased with an increase in trophic status. Protozoans (heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates) made up 24% (mesotrophic lakes) to 42% (hypertrophic lakes) of total zooplankton biomass on average, and were dominated by ciliates (62-80% of protozoan biomass). Seasonally, protozoans can build up to 60% of zooplankton biomass in spring, when heterotrophic flagellates can contribute similar to50% to protozoan biomass. Correlation analyses revealed significant relationships between the planktonic groups and indicated that pelagic food webs are influenced by both bottom-up as well as top-down mechanisms. Comparing lakes along a trophic gradient, resource parameters seem to be of major importance, whereas seasonal changes within a lake were perhaps regulated by the presence of predators.

Energy density was strongly negatively correlated with water content for all fishes (r(2) = 0.86 to 0.99). For fishes of comparable size, energy density of siscowet (10.8 kJ/g) was significantly higher than lean lake trout (7.8 kJ/g) and both were significantly higher than burbot (5.1 kJ/g). Energy density in spring was higher in lean and siscowet lake trout, and lower in burbot than in other seasons. No significant differences were apparent between sexes within a species. Energy density increased in a predictable fashion with body mass for lean and siscowet lake trout, but varied without trend for burbot. The regression common to the three species (kJ/g wet mass = 36.78 - 0.41(% water), p < 0.001) provides a straightforward method for estimating ontogenetic and seasonal energy density in these fishes.					; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Mason, Doran/0000-0002-6017-4243; 													0380-1330						1999	25	2					275	281		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70736-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70736-7													WOS:000081807600005

A decrease in water column concentrations of chlorophyll a coincident with an increase in pheophorbide and pheophytin concentrations occurred during a "clear-water" phase in June. The lack of a corresponding decrease in carotenoid pigment concentrations indicated that carotenoid pigments were degraded to a lesser extent than chlorophyll a during this period of heavy grazing pressure. Chlorophyll a, pheophorbide, and pheophytin showed temporal trends in fluxes to sediment traps that were similar for ail pigments but did not correspond to trends in water column pigment concentration. Fucoxanthin concentrations and microscopic examination indicated that the sedimentation of large, dense diatoms increased the sedimentation rate of chlorophyll during the clear-water phase. In addition, ungrazed diatoms apparently were the main source of pheophorbide in trap material during the clear-water phase, indicating that pheophorbide should not be used as a surrogate for fecal pellet sedimentation in lakes influenced by the sedimentation of large diatoms.

THE EFFECT OF REED CUTTING ON THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BREEDING PASSERINES	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE					5th Conference of Societas-Internationalis-Limnologiae (SIL)	AUG 26-30, 2006	Aqua Birds Working Grp, Eger, HUNGARY	Soc Int Limnol	Aqua Birds Working Grp			Reedbeds support high conservational value with their unique avifauna. Inadequate reed cutting methods can cause serious declines in the abundance of these bird species. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of reed cutting on the abundance and diversity of breeding passerine species, mainly Acrocephalus warblers. The study was carried out at Lake Kolon in Central Hungary, in homogenous reed (Phragmites communis) vegetation. Sample areas of 1 hectare in size were cut during 4 consecutive winters. Areas not cut but of the same size functioned as control areas. Sampling was carried out during the breeding season by mist-netting. Lake Kolon's passerine avifauna at the cut areas showed decreased species richness and decreased abundance of most of the reed-nesting species, which also resulted in decreased diversity. The Savi's Warbler (Locustella luscinioides), the Moustached Warbler (Acrocephalus melanopogon), the Sedge Warbler (A. schoenobaenus), and the Reed Warbler (A. scirpaceus) showed definite avoidance of the cut areas. Only the Great Reed Warbler (A. arundinaceus) showed preference for the cut areas. The study also revealed that edges created between cut and non-cut areas are much less preferred by passerine species than natural edges.																			1217-8837						2008	54			1			177	188																WOS:000266462100018

However, little work has been conducted to simultaneously investigate the abundance and diversity of AOA as well as correlations between archaeal amoA genotypes and environmental parameters of different ecosystems at one district. To understand the abundance, diversity, and distribution of AOA in Pearl River Delta of China in response to various habitats, the archaeal amoA genes in soil, marine, river, lake, hot spring and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples were investigated using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and clone libraries. Our analyses indicated that the diversity of AOA in various habitats was different and could be clustered into five major clades, i.e., estuary sediment, marine water/sediment, soil, hot spring and Cluster 1. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the structure of AOA communities in similar ecological habitats exhibited strong relation. The canonical correspondence method indicated that the AOA community structure was strongly correlated to temperature, pH, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and dissolved oxygen variables. Assessing AOA amoA gene copy numbers, ranging from 6.84 x 10(6) to 9.45 x 10(7) copies/g in dry soil/sediment, and 6.0(6) x 10(6) to 2.41 x 10(7) copies/L in water samples, were higher than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) by 1-2 orders of magnitude. However, AOA amoA copy numbers were much lower than AOB in WWTP activated sludge samples. Overall, these studies suggested that AOA may be a major contributor to ammonia oxidation in natural habitats but play a minor role in highly aerated activated sludge. The result also showed the ratio of AOA to AOB amoA gene abundance was positively correlated with temperature and less correlated with other environmental parameters. New data from our study provide increasing evidence for the relative abundance and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in the global nitrogen cycle.

The main objective of this study was to analyze the difference in species composition of cyanobacteria and to determine the concentration of cyanotoxins. Potentially toxic species of cyanobacteria were found to be the dominant species in each sample. Microcystis aeruginosa was dominant in Lake Niegocin, Limnothrix redekei and Planktolyngbya limnetica in Lake Pilwag, and Planktothrix agardhii in Lake Rekaty. Furthermore, the occurrence of an invasive cyanobacteria species, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, was detected in two lakes, Rekaty and Pilwag.

The boom is installed every winter to promote the formation of a stable ice cover on Lake Erie and to reduce ice discharge into the Niagara River. Sustained large ice discharges into the river can precipitate ice jams in the vicinity of the New York Power Authority's (NYPA) hydropower intakes located about 3 km upstream of Niagara Palls.

Effects of the 2011 Missouri River flood on walleye natal recruitment and habitat use in Lake Sharpe, South Dakota	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Floods affect fish populations in the short term (e.g. entrainment, mortality) and long term (e.g. recruitment, habitat availability), but oftentimes long-term effects are overlooked. In 2011, a catastrophic flood with record peak flows (4,200 m(3)/s) occurred in Lake Sharpe, a mainstem Missouri River reservoir. The flood's immediate impacts on the Lake Sharpe walleye (Sander vitreus) population have been documented, but long-term effects on natal recruitment and habitat use have not been assessed. We used otolith chemistry to evaluate spatial patterns in walleye natal recruitment and late-summer (i.e. July - September) habitat use in years before, during, and after the flood to gain insight into long-term flood impacts on the Lake Sharpe walleye population. From 2004 to 2013, all walleye hatched in embayments and main channel habitats as opposed to stilling basins or tributaries, and the majority of age >= 1 fish (i.e. age-1 or older) used the former habitats in late summer. During the flood year, natal recruitment remained stable relative to pre-flood levels in embayments (26% pre-flood, 20% during flood) and main channels (74% pre-flood, 80% during flood). Habitat use of age >= 1 walleye was generally unaltered by the flood as it remained consistent in embayments and main channel habitats before, during, and after the disturbance. Hence, the Lake Sharpe walleye population was largely unaffected by the flood in terms of natal recruitment and habitat use. Our results highlight the resilience of the Lake Sharpe walleye population to a catastrophic flood, providing fisheries professionals with an otolith chemistry approach for quantifying flood effects on natal recruitment and habitat use and developing spatially informed management approaches (e.g. habitat protection/rehabilitation, harvest regulations).

McKenzie			The shrinking Great Salt Lake contributes to record high dust-on-snow deposition in the Wasatch Mountains during the 2022 snowmelt season	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Seasonal snowmelt from the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah, USA, is a primary control on water availability for the metropolitan Wasatch Front, surrounding agricultural valleys, and the Great Salt Lake (GSL). Prolonged drought, increased evaporation due to warming temperatures, and sustained agricultural and domestic water consumption have caused GSL water levels to reach record low stands in 2021 and 2022, resulting in increased exposure of dry lakebed sediment. When dust emitted from the GSL dry lakebed is deposited on the adjacent Wasatch snowpack, the snow is darkened, and snowmelt is accelerated. Regular observations of dust-on-snow (DOS) began in the Wasatch Mountains in 2009, and the 2022 season was notable for both having the most dust deposition events and the highest snowpack dust concentrations. To understand if record high DOS concentrations were linked to record low GSL levels, dust source regions for each dust event were identified through a backward trajectory model analysis combined with aerosol measurements and field observations. Backward trajectories indicated that the exposed lakebed of the GSL contributed 23% of total dust deposition and had the highest dust emissions per surface area. The other potential primary contributors were the GSL Desert (45%) and the Sevier +Tule dry lakebeds (17%), both with lower per-area emissions. The impact on snowmelt, quantified by mass and energy balance modeling in the presence and absence of snow darkening by dust, was over 2 weeks (17 d) earlier. The impact of dust on snowmelt could have been more dramatic if the spring had been drier, but frequent snowfall buried dust layers, delaying dust-accelerated snowmelt later into the melt season.					; Mallia, Derek/JFK-8237-2023	Lang, Otto/0000-0002-3435-5032; Mallia, Derek/0000-0003-1983-7305; 													1748-9326					JUN 1	2023	18	6							064045	10.1088/1748-9326/acd409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acd409													WOS:001008339000001

Groundwater mixing in an alkaline paleolake: Eocene Green River Formation, Wyoming	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Tufa in the Little Mesa area of the northern Bridger Basin has been interpreted to record carbonate deposition via subaqueous and subaerial springs emanating near the shoreline of Eocene Lake Gosiute. Sedimentary facies record an overall transgression, culminating with mound structures that reach up to 9 m in height and 40 m in diameter. Mounds exhibit a strong positive, linear covariance between delta C-13 and delta O-18, defining a slope of similar to 1. Similar trends occur in many other paleolake deposits, where they are interpreted to reflect changes in evaporation, atmospheric CO2 exchange, and organic matter burial. However, delta C-13 and delta O-18 in this study also covary strongly with Sr-87/Sr-86, a new finding that is inconsistent with previously proposed mechanisms. We conclude that Little Mesa isotopic trends reflect mixing of groundwater with low Sr-87/Sr-86, delta O-18 and delta C-13 and lake water with opposite characteristics. Low Sr-87/Sr-86 in groundwater likely resulted from interaction with marine carbonate strata within the Sevier fold and thrust belt to the west, whereas drainage from Precambrian-cored uplifts that bounded Lake Gosiute to the north, east, and south was responsible for higher lake water ratios. Little Mesa carbonate facies are all less radiogenic than any time-equivalent facies near the center of the basin, implying horizontal and vertical gradients in Lake Gosiute Sr-87/Sr-86. Previous studies have shown that the lowest Sr-87/Sr-86 in basin center deposits correspond to lake highstands. Results of this study support the hypothesis that climatic modulation of surface runoff and spring emanations from the Sevier belt were principally responsible for precessional-scale expansions and contractions of Lake Gosiute. More broadly, groundwater discharge may represent an important but underappreciated contributor to covariance between Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, delta C-13 and delta O-18 in closed paleolake systems.

Assessing the effect of abiotic variables and zooplankton on picocyanobacterial dominance in two tropical mesotrophic reservoirs by means of evolutionary computation	WATER RESEARCH												Evolutionary computation has been applied to predict the occurrence of massive cyanobacteria proliferations; in the present study, this tool was further used to explore the factors responsible for maintaining picocyanobacterial dominance. Aiming to increase the understanding of factors that promote dominance of picocyanobacteria in tropical reservoirs, we chose two reservoirs used for water supplies located in different regions of Brazil and subjected to climate changes such as warmer winters that intensify water column stratification and prolonged dry seasons that cause water level decreases. This study focused on the diagnosis of the relationships among picocyanobacteria (1-2 mu m), zooplankton and environmental variables using evolutionary computation. The integrated data analysis performed here was very successful in elucidating the dynamics of picocyanobacterial density variation influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors by the modeling approach. Relative water column stability - RWCS and electrical conductivity were highlighted as the most important environmental drivers for picocyanobacterial peaks. Hybrid Evolutionary Analysis (HEA) models for the two reservoirs indicated for the first time in the literature that rotifers, small-sized cladocerans and copepods (mainly nauplii) can directly or indirectly control picocyanobacteria in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs, depending on RWCS conditions and electrical conductivity. However, this control is modulated by pH, water transparency and water temperature thresholds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Achyuthan, H; Kar, A; Eastoe, C				Achyuthan, Hema; Kar, Amal; Eastoe, Chris			Late Quaternary-Holocene lake-level changes in the eastern margin of the Thar Desert, India	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A study on two closed salt lake basins, Tal Chapar and Parihara in the eastern margin of the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, was carried out to unravel late Quaternary geomorphic evolution of these saline lakes. Both lakes are elliptical in shape bordered by stabilised dunes, and are oriented in a NE-SW direction, i.e., in the direction of the prevailing summer monsoon wind. Both lakes have been formed in the wind-shadow zones of isolated hills of Precambrian quartzite. Our study indicates that the late Quaternary sediments in the lakes began with the cyclic deposition of laminated fine silt layers (0.5 m thick), rich in organic matter, alternating with ripple cross-bedded sand layers (each similar to 1.5-2 m thick). Sand layers that are moderately sorted are separated by laminated silt-clay layers with gypsum/calcite and this unit occurs in the upper most 4 m sequence in deeper sections. The presence of gypsum crystals within the laminated sediments suggests a high concentration of Ca in the inflowing water. At Parihara Lake the organic carbon-rich sediments at 95 cm depth was dated to 7,375 + 155/-150 year BP. At Tal Chapar radiocarbon dates of 7,190 + 155/-150 and 9,903 + 360/-350 was obtained from the sediments rich in organic carbon occurring at a depth of 1.35 m and 1.80 m, respectively. The study reveals strong hydrologic oscillations during the past similar to 14,000 year BP (13,090 + 310/-300 year BP). Quaternary geomorphic processes, especially the strong aeolian processes during dry climatic phases, played a major role in the formation of the lake basins, as well as the fringing linear dunes. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses of the lacustrine sediments, supported by radiocarbon dates indicate the existence of an ephemeral lake earlier than similar to 13,000 year BP as sediments began to be deposited in a lacustrine environment implying sustained runoff in the catchments. A freshwater lake formed between 9,000 year and 7,000 year BP. The lake dried periodically and this strong fluctuating regime continued until about similar to 7,000 year BP. Mid-Holocene was wet and this was possibly due to higher winter rains A saline lake existed between 6,000 year and 1,300 year BP and finally present day semi arid conditions set in since 1,200 year BP. Remnants of a habitation site (hearth and charred bones) on stabilised dune at Devani near Tal Chapar were dated to 240 +/- 120 year, while that at Gopalpura was dated to 335 +/- 90 year. These historical sites on stabilised dunes were, according to the local accounts, settlements of people who used the lake brine for manufacturing salt.					; Achyuthan, Hema/AAA-6898-2022	Achyuthan, Hema/0000-0001-5495-4115; 													0921-2728					NOV	2007	38	4					493	507		10.1007/s10933-006-9086-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9086-6													WOS:000250238600003

C	Marsh, BH		Laflen, JM; Tian, JL; Huang, CH		Marsh, BH			Runoff contaminants from reduced tillage systems	SOIL EROSION AND DRYLAND FARMING					Conference on Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming	1999	YANGLING, PEOPLES R CHINA					Strict guidelines were established in the Delaware River Basin in Kansas regarding atrazine usage in an effort to reduce the amount entering rivers and lakes. Incorporation was stressed heavily because atrazine moves primarily in the solution phase in runoff No-till is required under conservation compliance for many acres in corn production. The surface-applied herbicides are more susceptible to movement with runoff water. Each best management practice addresses an important concern but may conflict with others. This study evaluated runoff and contaminants in tillage systems that varied in residue management and chemical placement. Three tillage treatments were used on three terraces, which were between 3/4 and 11/2 hectares. The disk tillage treatment was disked in the fall and spring and a field cultivator pass followed chemical application. The Mulch Master treatment was a single tillage operation after chemical application. The no-till treatment had surface-applied chemicals and only planting disturbed surface residue. Atrazine(2 kg ha(-1)) was applied in liquid fertilizer (112 kg N and 50 kg P ha(-1)). Runoff was measured, sampled, and analyzed for contaminants. The percent of soil surface covered by residue increased over time and was substantially higher for the no-till and Mulch Master treatments, whereas the amount from the disk tillage treatment remained constant. Following planting in 1996, residue cover for each treatment was 79% for no-till, 65% for Mulch Master, and 21% for disk tillage. Less runoff was measured from the no-till treatment because the soil surface was protected by the crop residue and soil structure was improved. Runoff from the Mulch Master treatment was higher than that of the no-till treatment but less than the disk tillage treatment. Plenty of residue remained on the soil surface, but the Mulch Master tillage disrupted the continuous pores that developed. Sediment losses were negligible for the no-till and Mulch Master treatments throughout the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons. However, intense rainfall events produced substantial soil loss in the disk tillage system caused by the combination of low infiltration, high runoff, and an unprotected soil surface. In contrast to the low sediment amounts in runoff water from the no-till treatment, very high atrazine concentrations were measured in the first runoff event. Herbicide concentrations declined with each successive runoff event for all tillage treatments, and by the fourth runoff event, atrazine concentrations were not different among treatments. Incorporation reduced atrazine concentration and loss by two-thirds when it was done after application early in the growing season. When chemical application occurred late in the growing season, much higher concentrations of atrazine were observed in runoff water for all treatments. Total atrazine loss was greater from the tillage treatments because substantially higher runoff amounts resulted from tillage done during June when intense rainfall events can occur. Best management practices that keep water from leaving the field improve crop production and reduce surface water contamination. When tillage is necessary, preserving as much residue on the surface as possible reduces soil loss and water contamination. New tillage technology that can maintain substantial residue amounts on the soil surface and incorporate herbicides and fertilizers through that residue can reduce the amounts of both sediment and chemical contaminants that leave a field with runoff water.																					0-8493-2349-5				2000							153	163																WOS:000088804600017
J	DURAZO, J; FARVOLDEN, RN				DURAZO, J; FARVOLDEN, RN			THE GROUNDWATER REGIME OF THE VALLEY OF MEXICO FROM HISTORIC EVIDENCE AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater is a matter of major importance in the Valley of Mexico because some 20 million people depend on it for most of their water supply. In Mexico, historical accounts, documents and native legends provide additional information of past conditions which relates to hydrogeological conditions. In any analysis of groundwater resources it is important to know the original conditions. The Valley of Mexico is a graben structure, closed hydrologically and covered by a series of lakes at the time of the Conquest. Groundwater recharge occurs in the mountains of volcanic rocks that surround the Valley to form the Basin of Mexico. Where the rocks are visibly permeable, the water-table is deep, for the most part, and runoff is low. Thick lacustrine clays cover the Valley floor and artesian conditions once prevailed. Large springs of potable water were numerous at the edge of the Valley, and when permeable aquifers pinch-out. Thermal mineral springs occur along lineaments thought to be fractures in the rocks below the alluvial fill. The entire Valley floor and the lowest slopes of the mountains were zones of groundwater discharge. All water discharge from the Valley was by evaporation and transpiration, and salts accumulated in the lake-water and in the clays. The main lakes were nonpotable and the Aztecs and later the Spanish colonials depended on groundwater from the springs. Salt production from brines was an important industry in the Aztec society as it is today. The ahuehuete tree, (Taxodium mucronuatum), which commonly lives to be many hundreds of years olds is a phreatophyte and an indicator of fresh groundwater discharge in the Valley. It used to be much more abundant. Its occurrence where earthquake damage is worst suggests upward migration of fresh groundwater through fractures in the clay that have been opened by seismic response. The water table and the capillary fringe are near ground surface over a wide zone of lowlands around the edge of the ancient lakes. A small amount of rain produces overland flow almost immediately and flooding has always been a problem to societies that occupy the Valley. Except for one site known to us, groundwater gradients have been reversed everywhere in the Valley by pumping of the aquifes, which began in 1847 and became intense beginning in the 1930s, so that the direction of flow is downward, which allows, for the first time, contaminants from the surface to migrate downward to the aquifers. Heavy pumping has also caused drainage and consolidation of the lacustrine clays, and consequently land subsidence of up to 8 m in the central part of the city. A simple water-balance indicates that groundwater discharge to the Valley floor is about 43 m3 s-1, which is less than in being pumped for municipal supply. Some of the deficiency is made up from compaction of the clays, a nonrenewable source.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	1989	112	1-2					171	190		10.1016/0022-1694(89)90187-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(89)90187-X													WOS:A1989CM68500011

But, little is known about how these functional groups coexist with each other in aquatic environments, particularly in subtropical reservoirs. In this study, we describe the nature of microeukaryotic communities in a subtropical deep reservoir during the strongly stratified period. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis gel band sequencing, pyrosequencing, and light microscopy were used together to facilitate an in-depth investigation of the community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fungi. Our results showed that thermal and oxygen stratification shaped the composition of the phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fungi populations in the reservoir. Stratification was evident among ecological functional groups in autumn: producers and consumers were overwhelmingly dominant in the epilimnion characterized by high temperatures and oxygen levels, whereas decomposers were inclined to inhabit the hypolimnion. These results contribute to our understanding of the relationship of ecosystem functional groups in the man-made aquatic systems and have important practical implications for reservoir management. Results suggest that the strategies for the control of eutrophication and harmful algal bloom prevention should focus on a fuller understanding of the consequences of both thermal stratification and vertical distribution of microplankton.

The purpose was to evaluate the effects of burning on the regeneration of blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, and post oak, Quercus stellata. At each site, the study compared three treatments: burned during growing season, burned during dormant season, and an unburned control. The Oklahoma locations were Lake Carl Blackwell, Lake Keystone, and Tall Grass Prairie Preserve. Twenty five plots were sampled in each treatment at each site. Densities of seedlings and saplings were measured. The density of seedlings, saplings and overstory trees was measured. The occurrence of seedlings was rare. Oak regeneration was plentiful and resulted mainly from sprouting for both species regardless of the fire regime. No seedlings of Q. stellata were found and those of Q. marilandica were found only at Lake Carl Blackwell. Although fire stimulates sprouting, it can prevent saplings from growing into larger trees. Fire has benefited Q. marilandica more than Q. stellata.					Wittwer, Raphael/AFK-9307-2022																0-939970-77-5				1999							359	361																WOS:000085856700052

Chironomid assemblages were studied in 49 samples along an g m long sediment core covering the last 1800 years. July air temperatures were inferred using an inference model based on the distribution of chironomid assemblages in 100 Swiss lakes. The transfer function has a leave-one-out cross-validated coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.88, a root mean square error of prediction 1.40 degrees C. Despite possible biases induced by methodological aspects and the ecological complexity of the chironomid response to both climate and environmental changes, the concordance of the Lake Anterne temperature reconstruction with other Alpine records suggests that the transfer function has successfully reconstructed past summer temperature during the last two millennia. The twentieth century is the only section of the record which shows a poor agreement with other climate reconstructions and the distinct warming found in most instrumental records for this period is not apparent in the Lake Anterne record. Stocking of the lake with fish from the early twentieth century onwards was found to be a possible cause of changes in the chironomid fauna and subsequent distortion in the inferred climate signal. Evidence was found of a cold phase at Lake Anterne between AD 400 and 680 a warm episode between AD 680 and 1350, and another cold phase between AD 1350 and 1900. These events were possibly correlated to the so-called 'Dark Age Cold Period' (DACP) the 'Mediaeval arm Period' (MWP) and the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). The chironomid-based inference model reconstructed a July air temperature decrease of c. 0.7 degrees C for the DACP and 1.3 degrees C for the LIA compared with the temperature prevailing during the MWP.

J	Moreno, PI				Moreno, Patricio, I			Timing and structure of vegetation, fire, and climate changes on the Pacific slope of northwestern Patagonia since the last glacial termination	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												By virtue of its location in the southern mid-latitudes, northwestern Patagonia (40 degrees-44 degrees S) offers the opportunity to unravel the mechanisms involved in the initiation and propagation of paleoclimate signals of hemispheric and global significance. Of particular importance is deciphering the evolution of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) considering their influence at continental, zonal, hemispheric, and global scale. Here I present a multi-decadal record from Lago Proschle, a small closed-basin lake located on the Pacific slope of northwestern Patagonia, to examine the timing and structure of vegetation, fire, and climate change along a continuum since the onset of the Last Glacial Termination (T1). The record shows rapid glacier recession during T1, reaching the western Andean foothills in similar to 400 years or less. Nothofagus-dominated forests established between similar to 17.4-17 ka, followed by closed-canopy North Patagonian Rain Forests (NPRF) with shade-tolerant thermophilous trees between similar to 16.3-15.4 ka. These changes suggest an abrupt warming trend and an increase in precipitation at similar to 16.3 ka, associated with a northward shift of the SWW. Subsequent increases in cold-tolerant hygrophilous trees between similar to 15.4-12.8 ka imply a shift to cold, more humid conditions during the Antarctic Cold Reversal, suggesting stronger SWW influence. This was followed by stand-replacing fires brought by a sudden decline in summer precipitation at similar to 12.8 ka, associated with a millennial-scale southward shift of the SWW which was contemporaneous with the onset of the Younger Dryas. Dominance of thermophilous, summer-drought tolerant Valdivian rainforest trees and high fire activity ensued between similar to 10.3-7.8 ka, suggesting peak warmth and overall decline in annual precipitation associated with weakening of the SWW during the early Holocene. A multi-millennial cooling and wetting trend started at similar to 7.8 ka, brought by stronger SWW influence, followed by recurrent, centennial-scale variations in temperature and precipitation starting at similar to 6.4 ka. Deforestation, fire, and spread of non-native herbs by Chilean/European settlers began during the late 18th century. Abrupt vegetation changes in the Lago Proschle record were driven by rapid climate changes over the last 17,400 years amplified, in some instances, by fire disturbance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2007 flood in the Sahel: causes, characteristics and its presentation in the media and FEWS NET	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												During the rainy season in 2007, reports about exceptional rains and floodings in the Sahel were published in the media, especially in August and September. Institutions and organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP) and FEWS NET put the events on the agenda and released alerts and requested help. The partly controversial picture was that most of the Sahel faced a crisis caused by widespread floodings. Our study shows that the rainy season in 2007 was exceptional with regard to rainfall amount and return periods. In many areas the event had a return period between 1 and 50 yr with high spatial heterogeneity, with the exception of the Upper Volta basin, which yielded return periods of up to 1200 yr. Despite the strong rainfall, the interpretation of satellite images show that the floods were mainly confined to lakes and river beds. However, the study also proves the difficulties in assessing the meteorological processes and the demarcation of flooded areas in satellite images without ground truthing. These facts and the somewhat vague and controversial reports in the media and FEWS NET demonstrate that it is crucial to thoroughly analyze such events at a regional and local scale involving the local population.

High flow of water occurred in feeding drains of Sanghar and Sindhri during summer season. In KPOD, tidal link and Cholri Lake have come under the influence of seawater. The water from the seawater moves back along tidal link and KPOD due to a number of breaches and extensive erosion in the region. The lower areas of KPOD toward tidal link have become highly saline (brackish water). Salinity was in between 44.6 - 51.5g/L.

The loss can be partially compensated by growth of filamentous algae. Our results show that macroinvertebrates typically associated with submerged macrophytes as well as planktonic crustaceans and rotifers occurred within algal mats at high densities. Aggregations of filamentous algae are usually short-term, with frequent appearances and disappearances. The rate of colonization of algal mats by invertebrates is rapid. In locations with a high degree of water exchange, animals colonize both living and decomposing algal mats at a similar rate, but in sheltered habitats, decomposing filamentous algae are colonized by a smaller number of animals. Comparison was made between the occurrence of invertebrate macrofauna on Chara spp., Potamogeton perfoliatus, P. lucens and Myriophyllum spicatum in several lakes. Although these macrophytes differ visibly in morphology and phenology, the number and composition of macroinvertebrates during summer was associated more closely with trophic state of a lake than with plant species.

The temperature ranged from 10.4 to 28 degrees C showing subtropical nature. pH was consistent both spatially and temporally except at one Station where it was alkaline having value ranging from 6.9 to 7.26. There was a trend in dissolved oxygen to be more during cold season. Electrical conductivity ranged between 105.56 to 201 mu S cm(-1). It was high during the dry season and low during rainy season. Transparency and turbidity values indicated that in most Stations water was clear and the two parameters were found to be negatively correlated (r= -0.381). Based on the hardness (41 to 78mg l(-1)), water was soft. Significant negative correlation(r=-0.532) was found between rainfall and hardness. Calcium and magnesium ions were found to be below the prescribed value of WHO. These two parameters were found to be positively correlated with hardness.

Naegleria fowleri: Diagnosis, Pathophysiology of Brain Inflammation, and Antimicrobial Treatments	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE												Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a very rare disease with a high mortality rate. PAM is caused by Naegleria fowleri, an amoeba which resides in freshwater lakes and ponds and can survive in inadequately chlorinated pools (Lopez, C.; Budge, P.; Chen, J., et al. Primary amebic meningoencephalitis: a case report and literature review. Pediatr. Emerg. Care 2012, 28, 272-276). In the past 50 years, there have been over 130 cases of Naegleria induced PAM in the United States with only three known survivors; one survivor was diagnosed and treated at Arkansas Children's Hospital. Successful treatment of PAM started with a rapid diagnosis, extensive antimicrobial therapy including an investigational medication rniltefosine, supportive care, an intraventricular shunt, and hypothermia. These treatments address different aspects of the disease process. Increased understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of PAM is important especially for patients who present with meningitis like findings during the summer months.																			1948-7193					SEP	2016	7	9					1178	1179		10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00232								27525348					WOS:000384041000003

Association between geomorphic attributes of watersheds, water temperature, and salmon spawn timing in Alaskan streams	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Intraspecific variation in the seasonal reproductive timing of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) has important implications for the resilience of salmon and for organisms in freshwater and terrestrial communities that depend on salmon resources. Stream temperature has well known associations with salmon spawn timing but how stream and watershed geomorphology relates to the variation in salmon spawn timing is less understood. We used multivariate statistics applied to five environmental variables to compare conditions across 36 watersheds in the Wood River basin in southwest Alaska. We found that the environmental conditions in the first two axes of a principal components analysis (PCA) explained 76% of the variation in summer temperature among streams and 45% of the variation in spawn timing of sockeye salmon. The average habitat characteristics of streams that characterized three spawn timing groups of sockeye salmon were significantly distinct from one another. Sites supporting early spawning populations tend to have steeper and smaller watersheds, while late spawning populations occur in streams draining large, lower gradient watersheds with lakes in the drainage network. Finally, we show that stream temperature and spawn timing among streams have little spatial correlation across the landscape, thereby producing a fine-scale mosaic of spawn timing across the river basin. These results demonstrate that geomorphology and hydrology interact to produce a heterogeneous thermal template for natural selection to influence salmon spawn timing across river basins.

J	Hammerschmidt, CR; Fitzgerald, WF				Hammerschmidt, CR; Fitzgerald, WF			Photodecomposition of methylmercury in an arctic Alaskan lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sunlight-induced decomposition of monomethylmercury (MMHg) reduces its availability for accumulation in aquatic food webs. We examined MMHg degradation in epilimnetic waters of Toolik Lake (68 degrees 38' N, 149 degrees 36' W) in arctic Alaska, a region illuminated by sunlight almost continuously during the summer. MMHg decomposition in surface water of Toolik Lake is exclusively abiotic and mediated by sunlight; comparable rates of MMHg decomposition were observed in filter-sterilized and unfiltered surface waters incubated under in situ sunlight and temperature conditions, and no MMHg was degraded in unfiltered aliquots incubated in the dark. Rates of photodecomposition are first order with respect to both MMHg concentration and the intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), except at the lake surface where rates of photochemical degradation are enhanced relative to PAR intensity and may be attributed to an additional influence of ultraviolet light. The estimated annual loss of MMHg to photodecomposition in Toolik Lake, though limited to a 100-d ice-free season, accounts for about 80% of the MMHg mobilized annually from in situ sedimentary production, the primary source in Toolik Lake. These results suggest that greater light attenuation in lacustrine surface waters, a potential result of increased loadings of dissolved organic matter due to continued warming in the Arctic, may result in less photodecomposition and subsequently greater availability of MMHg for bioaccumulation.

Without any formal competencies they are exclusively based on cooperation between widely self-organized systems (regions). Thus, cross-border governance is facing multiple governance dilemmas. In this respect imperative environmental problems have often served as unifying element, putting diverging forces into the back. But just as often these issues fell from the agenda when the most important problems seemed to be solved - as they are too likely to cause severe conflicts between the partners. The paper discusses the significance of cross-border governance for environmental issues in Europe, mainly based on empirical data from the cross-border region of Lake Constance.

The patterns of nitrogen fixation in haloalkaliphilic phototrophic communities of Kulunda Steppe soda lakes (Altai, Russia)	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Nitrogen fixation (NF) of phototrophic communities was studied in a number of soda lakes with a wide range of salinity (25-400 g/l) located in Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia) during several summer seasons (2011-2016). The phototrophic communities were represented by the algal-bacterial Ctenocladus communities or cyanobacterial biofilms dominated by heterocystous and non-heterocystous cyanobacteria and purple sulfur bacteria Ectothiorhodospira sp. (up to 210 g/l) and endoevaporitic Euhalothece communities dominated by the extremely salt-tolerant unicellular cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp. and Ectothiorhodospira sp. (above 350 g/l). Salinity was the major factor influencing the composition and NF potential of the phototrophic communities. The communities dominated by vegetative heterocystous cyanobacteria exhibited light-independent NF at total salinity up to 60 g/l. The communities dominated by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria exhibited light-dependent NF in a range of 55-100 g/l, but it was significantly suppressed at 100 g/l. At 160-200 g/l the dark heterotrophic NF was a prevailing process if communities didn't contain Euhalothece sp. At salt-saturating ranges above 350 g/l, light-dependent NF associated with the Euhalothece communities was detected. A statistically significant positive correlation between the NF and diurnal light intensity was found in all samples of communities dominated by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria in contrast to communities dominated by heterocystous cyanobacteria with insignificant correlation coefficients.

Using National-Scale Data To Develop Nutrient-Microcystin Relationships That Guide Management Decisions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Quantitative models that predict cyanotoxin concentrations in lakes and reservoirs from nutrient concentrations would facilitate management of these resources for recreation and as sources of drinking water. Development of these models from field data has been hampered by the high proportion of samples in which cyanotoxin concentrations are below detection limits and by the high variability of cyanotoxin concentrations within individual lakes. Here, we describe a national scale hierarchical Bayesian model that addresses these issues and that predicts microcystin concentrations from summer mean total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations. This model accounts for 69% of the variance in mean microcystin concentrations in lakes and reservoirs of the conterminous United States. Mean microcystin concentrations were more strongly associated with differences in total nitrogen than total phosphorus. A general approach for assessing this and similar types of models for their utility for guiding management decisions is also described.

Walleye consumption and long-term population trends following gizzard shad introduction into a western South Dakota Reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) was introduced into 1,955-ha Angostura Reservoir, South Dakota to provide increased prey resources for walleye (Sander vitreus). Linear correlation analysis indicated that following gizzard shad introduction, walleye catch-per-unit-effort and mean length at age have increased over time (r = 0.68 to 0.85, P = 0.02 to 0.001). Walleye stomach contents were collected monthly from April through September, 2004 to determine the extent to which age-0 gizzard shad were being utilized as prey during the growing season. Age-0 gizzard shad were absent from walleye diets from April to mid-July (pre-shad-available period); however, from mid-July through early September (shad-available period), age-0 gizzard shad were an important prey item in all walleye diets. Mean weight decreased for walleyes of ages 2-5 during the spring, before age-0 gizzard shad became available; however, growth rate of walleyes increased appreciably during the shad-available period and was attributable to consumption of age-0 shad prey. In Angostura Reservoir, which lies at the northwestern edge of the gizzard shad range, walleye population characteristics have improved following shad introduction and during 2004, age-0 shad directly affected walleye feeding and growth.

AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The aim of this study was to draw a general picture of the phytoplankton community in peri-Alpine lakes, including for the first time a broad data set of six deep peri-Alpine lakes, belonging to the same geographical region. The objective was to define the main key drivers that influence the phytoplankton community composition in this particular vulnerable region, for which the impacts of climate change have been demonstrated to be stronger than on a global average. The phytoplankton was investigated with a particular focus on cyanobacteria and using a classification approach based on morpho-functional groups. We hypothesized that phytoplankton in peri-Alpine lakes is mainly driven by nutrient loads as well as by water temperatures, variables that are strongly influenced by climate change and eutrophication. Though different phytoplankton configurations among lakes were partly due to their geographical (altitude) position, assemblages were mostly linked to temperature and nutrients. Furthermore, the results confirmed the significant role of the spring fertilization on the seasonal phytoplankton development. Cyanobacteria were related to the increasing annual average of air and water temperature gradient and therefore might become more important under future warming scenario. Air temperatures have a significant impact on water temperature in the uppermost meters of the water column, with a stronger influence on warmer lakes.

Data collected by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) from Lake Erken in Sweden has been corrected for radiometrical irregularities close to the borders of the image and the radiance values were converted to reflectance values using the 6S code. The data was then geometrically corrected, merged with GPS data and correlated with data from a simultaneous field sampling session using linear regression. The correlation between the extracted image data and the studied water quality parameters (chlorophyll a and phaeophytine a, suspended particulate matter and beam attenuation) is moderate, and the data processing has revealed special problems in this kind of correlation studies, partly caused by the dynamic character of the water. Spectral mode data from the same area has also been used to study the spectral variability of the lake.																					2-908885-22-0				1998							229	+																WOS:000166270600027

Trees in upper shore positions were disturbed by waves and ice erosion. These geomorphic events were dated using compression wood, ice scars, and traumatic annual rings. Trees that established during favorable episodes in the 19th century have been severely destabilized by shoreline disturbances in most decades since 1881; 1881-83, 1912, 1922, 1936, 1947-48, 1958-59 and 1974-79. The age structure of shoreline shrubs indicates recent colonization associated with low lake levels (gauged since 1974).

The extracellular polysaccharide content was significantly higher in treatments b and c than in the control treatment. All Microcystis species existed as single cells under the control treatment but formed colonies in treatments b and c. All of the colonies were irregular with indistinct margins. M. ichthyoblabe, M. viridis, M. flos-aquae, and M. wesenbergii formed colonies with similar morphologies and their cells were loosely aggregated. In contrast, M. aeruginosa formed denser colonies with no distinct holes. The colony morphologies differed from the classic morphology of M. ichthyoblabe field-grown colonies but resembled that of small colonies found in Lake Taihu (Yangtze Delta Plain, China) during early spring. This indicates that field- and laboratory-grown colonies are governed by similar formation processes. We suggest that in laboratory and field environments, M. ichthyoblabe (or M. flos-aquae) colonies are representative of small colonies formed from single Microcystis cells, whereas the morphology of older colonies evolves to resemble M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa colonies.					xiao, man/N-2972-2014; Xiao, Man/N-2972-2014; Li, Ming/JPA-5759-2023	Xiao, Man/0000-0003-0021-2129; 													0921-8971	1573-5176				JUN	2016	28	3					1533	1541		10.1007/s10811-015-0707-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-015-0707-1													WOS:000375315100008

Here we use biogenic silica ( BSi) concentrations preserved in lacustrine sediment from an oligotrophic lake to quantitatively reconstruct air temperature at Hallet Lake in south-central Alaska. Mean June through August temperature measured over the past 80 yr at Valdez ( Alaska) correlate with BSi from Hallet Lake ( r = 0.87, p = 0.01). We chose a nested function to model the non-linear relation between summer temperature and BSi in the calibration data set, and to reconstruct temperature for the past 2 ka. Our BSi-inferred temperature reconstruction shows synchronous changes with independent paleoclimatic proxies for southern Alaska, and provides evidence for a greater rate and magnitude of 20th century temperature warming at Hallet Lake than recorded by other quantitative temperature proxies in the region.					; McKay, Nicholas/JYQ-5440-2024; Kaufman, Darrell/A-2471-2008	McKay, Nicholas/0000-0003-3598-5113; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 13	2008	35	5							L05709	10.1029/2007GL032876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL032876													WOS:000254165200003

Observations over ten recent years show that the number of small and medium earthquakes (6 < K <less than or equal to> 13) in "quiet" time is nearly twice as high as that during storms, which indicates the influence of storm vibrations on the seismicity.

On the basis of the chlorophyll content in the summer season (July-August), the main part of the sampled lakes can be attributed to the mesotrophic type, 2 lakes - oligotrophic, 10 - eutrophic. The content of chlorophyll-a in the lakes ranged from 0.3 to 55.2 mu g/l, seston - from 0.3 to 29.8 mg/l. Pigment indices, reflecting the state of planktonic producers, did not change significantly depending on the trophic state of the lake. However, in more trophic waters, the absorption spectra are written more clearly; accordingly, the indices appear to be more reliable and informative.

Impact of lake breezes on ozone and nitrogen oxides in the Greater Toronto Area	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Meteorological and air quality datasets from summertime (May to September, 2010-2012) were analysed in order to assess the influence of lake-breeze circulations on pollutant levels in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). While previous estimates of the frequency of summer days experiencing lake breezes range between 25 and 32 % for the GTA, a simple algorithm using surface meteorological observations suggested Lake Ontario breezes occurred on 56% of summer days, whereas a more reliable multiplatform approach yielded a frequency of 74%. Data from five air quality stations across the GTA were used to compare air quality on days during which a lake-breeze circulation formed ("lake breeze days") versus days when one did not ("non-lake breeze days"). Average daytime O-3 maxima were 13.6-14.8 ppb higher on lake breeze days relative to non-lake breeze days. Furthermore, the Ontario Ambient Air Quality Criteria (AAQC) for 1-h average O-3 (80 ppb) and 8-h average O-3 (65 ppb) were exceeded only on lake breeze days and occurred on a total of 30 and 54 days throughout the study period, respectively. A causal link between lake-breeze circulations and enhanced O-3 was identified by examining several days in which only some of the air quality sites were inside the lake-breeze circulation. O-3 mixing ratios at sites located within the circulation were at least 30 ppb higher than sites outside the circulation, despite similar temperatures, cloud conditions and synoptic regimes across the region. Rapid O-3 increases were concurrent with the arrival of the lake-breeze front, suggesting O-3-rich air from over the lake is being advected inland throughout the day. Lake-breeze circulations were found to have less impact on nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels. Morning NO was greater on lake breeze days, probably due to the stagnant conditions favourable for lake breeze formation. During the late afternoon, only inland sites experience increased NOx on lake breeze days, likely as a result of being downwind from near-shore city centres. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J.; van Hinsberg, Vincent J.; McKenzie, Jeffrey M.; Yee, Sophia			Characterization of acid river dilution and associated trace element behavior through hydrogeochemical modeling: A case study of the Banyu Pahit River in East Java, Indonesia	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Kawah Ijen volcano in East Java, Indonesia emits hyperacid (pH approximate to 0) brines rich in toxic elements including F, Al, Cd and Tl, which are transported downstream by the Banyu Pahit River, which is eventually used to irrigate farmland on the Asambagus Plain. The fate and behavior of major and trace elements are investigated, in the region of greatest change to the Banyu Pahit River, where thermal springs and the neutral Kali Sat and Kali Senggon Rivers increase its discharge 6-fold and pH increases from 1.9 to 4.5 with the development of abundant precipitates. The conservative behavior of Cl, F and SO4 allows determination of the proportions of the mixing constituents at each confluence. Comparing a mass balance model based on the resulting proportions with measured concentrations demonstrates conservative behavior for most cations, with the exception of Si, Zr, Sn and Ba, which precipitate as amorphous silica, barite, and Zr and Sn phases, respectively. Iron is added as particulate Fe-(oxy) hydroxide in mixing with thermal spring outflow, and dissolves in the lower pH water. This also contributes Co, Cd, Mn, Y, and the rare earth elements, which are desorbed from the Fe-(oxy) hydroxide upon entering the acid water. Subsequent saturation in Fe-(oxy) hydroxide after mixing with the neutral rivers leads to a reverse response. Still, element behavior is close to conservative, which means that the volcanogenic toxic element load is almost entirely transferred to the Asambagus Plain with ensuing environmental and health impacts. This study shows that compositions of these acid waters can be understood and reproduced in a thermodynamic model, but only when fine-tuned using measured compositions and field observations. Therefore, the model's utility in assessing the fate of toxic elements and in planning the environmental mitigation is limited. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	DENDY, FE				DENDY, FE			SEDIMENT YIELD FROM A MISSISSIPPI DELTA COTTON FIELD	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Sediment yield from flat (0.2% slope) delta fields was measured during a 33-mo. study. Annual erosion rates were higher than anticipated, ranging from a maximum 12 metric tons ha-1 for a year of above normal rainfall to a minimum 5 metric tons ha-1 for a year of slightly below normal rainfall. Highest sediment concentrations in runoff occurred in the spring during the seedbed preparation and planting season when the soil was bare of vegetative cover, freshly plowed, and highly susceptible to erosion. Lowest concentrations occurred in Sept. and Oct. when vegetative cover was good. Sediment particle size data from selected storms showed that about 83% of the sediment removed from the fields was < 2 .mu.m in diameter and nearly all, 98%, was < 16 .mu.m. Field soils were composed of 24% clay, 23% silt and 53% sand, so considerable enrichment of fine particles occurred during the erosion process. Most sediment deposits in streams and lakes of the area are composed of fine materials. Gradual enrichment of coarse particles in the soils is occurring over long periods of time.																			0047-2425	1537-2537					1981	10	4					482	486		10.2134/jeq1981.00472425001000040012x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1981.00472425001000040012x													WOS:A1981MP30500013

It has been detected in various environment media and has been approved to be high toxic to aquatic organisms. However, the exposure levels of TBBPA in the main watersheds in China have not been investigated sufficiently. In this study TBBPA concentrations in water, sediment and tissues of four fish species from Lake Chaohu were determined. Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of TBBPA in water and sediment, and the relationship among TBBPA concentrations in fish tissues and fish size were analyzed. The results showed that the maximum TBBPA concentration in sediment was 518 ng/g in March 2008. It is almost the highest value than those ever reported anywhere in the world. In lake water, TBBPA level reached the maximum value of 4.87 mu g/L in July. Tissue distributions of TBBPA in four fish species were similar, and the mean concentrations in the fish were in the range of 28.5-39.4 ng/g, much higher than those reported in Japan, Europe, and the United States. The maximum concentrations of TBBPA were found in kidneys where TBBPA concentration was positively correlated with fish size of Cyprinus carpio. Results demonstrated a widespread distribution of TBBPA in Lake Chaohu. The source was mainly inflow rivers near the cities. The distribution coefficient among water, fish, and sediment was 1:28:117. This indicated that sediment was the main repository for TBBPA within Lake Chaohu. Furthermore, TBBPA may pose a potential ecological risk in the lake during summer.

Spatio-temporal November and March snowfall trends in the Lake Michigan region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study has investigated the spatio-temporal variability of November and March Lake Michigan snowfall for the period 1950-2013. Snowfall characteristics were assessed using time series analysis, geographic information systems, and visualization. Results indicate significant temporal decreases of November and March snowfall, peak inter-annual variability within the lake-effect belt, modest concurrent and lagged sensitivity to teleconnection indices, and strong dependence of snowfall on temperature. The decreased snowfall is in contrast to December-February snowfall and associated with a decreasing fraction of November and March precipitation days occurring as snow days, rather than changes in precipitation frequency. The decreasing fraction of precipitation days occurs as snowfall is consistent with synoptic-scale disturbances producing rain rather than snow and lake-effect rain falling in lieu of snow.					; Lyza, Anthony/JAX-6933-2023	Lyza, Anthony/0000-0002-8485-8666; Clark, Craig/0000-0001-8389-7519; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN 30	2018	38	8					3250	3263		10.1002/joc.5498	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5498													WOS:000439793900004

Although 60% of the maximum, midsummer biomass overwinters, little or no new tissue is produced between Oct. and early May. Annual net production, estimated from the rate of leaf turnover, is less than the maximum biomass (P/B = 0.69/yr). N and P concentrations are lowest in mid-Aug., when the amount of each analyzed element per square meter is near its maximum (N, P, Ca, Mg, Na, K). Autumnal uptake of N may contribute 25% of the next season''s growth requirements, but P uptake is largely offset by losses during the winter. Fruiting and sterile plants have similar contents of N, P and K in late July, but the fruiting plants are richer in Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn and Zn. At the maximum depth limit of the population in Mirror Lake, New Hampshire [USA] (2.3 m), flowering is absent and seedlings are sparse, suggesting reproductive failure as a controlling factor at the margin of the population.																			0008-4026						1978	56	12					1425	1433		10.1139/b78-165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b78-165													WOS:A1978FG94100006
J	Wissink, JG; Herlina, H				Wissink, J. G.; Herlina, H.			Direct numerical simulation of gas transfer across the air-water interface driven by buoyant convection	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS												A series of direct numerical simulations of mass transfer across the air-water interface driven by buoyancy-induced convection have been carried out to elucidate the physical mechanisms that play a role in the transfer of heat and atmospheric gases. The buoyant instability is caused by the presence of a thin layer of cold water situated on top of a body of warm water. In time, heat and atmospheric gases diffuse into the uppermost part of the thermal boundary layer and arc subsequently transported down into the bulk by falling sheets and plumes of cold water. Using a specifically designed numerical code for the discrctization of scalar convection and diffusion, it was possible to accurately resolve this buoyant-instability-induced transport of atmospheric gases into the bulk at a realistic Prandtl number (Pr = 6) and Schmidt numbers ranging from Sc = 20 to Sc = 500. The simulations presented here provided a detailed insight into instantaneous gas transfer processes. The falling plumes with highly gas-saturated fluid in their core were found to penetrate deep inside the bulk. With an initial temperature difference between the water surface and the bulk of slightly above 2 K. peaks in the instantaneous heat flux in excess of 1600 W m(-2) were observed, proving the potential effectiveness of buoyant-convective heat and gas transfer. Furthermore, the validity of the scaling law for the ratio of gas and heat transfer velocities K-L/H-L alpha (Pr/Sc)(0.5) for the entire range of Schmidt numbers considered was confirmed. A good time-accurate approximation of K-L was found using surface information such as velocity fluctuations and convection cell size or surface divergence. A reasonable time accuracy for the K-L estimation was obtained using the horizontal integral length scale and the root mean square of the horizontal velocity fluctuations in the upper part of the bulk.

J	Ngomanda, A; Neumann, K; Schweizer, A; Maley, J				Ngomanda, Alfred; Neumann, Katharina; Schweizer, Astrid; Maley, Jean			Seasonality change and the third millennium BP rainforest crisis in southern Cameroon (Central Africa)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The third millennium BP crisis of the central African rainforest is not Sufficiently understood. The low resolution of most pollen profiles and a large plateau of the calibration Curve aggravate the exact dating of the event, and its causal climatic parameters are debated. We present a high-resolution pollen profile from the swamp site Nyabessan in the Southern Cameroonian rainforest, covering the period 3100-2300 cal yr BR Between 3100 and 2500 cal yr BP, the climate was favourable for a regional evergreen forest with Caesalpiniaceae and Lophira and a local Raphia swamp forest. Around 2500/2400 cal yr BP, a significant decrease of mature forest and swamp forest taxa and an increase of pioneers indicate that the rain forest was seriously disturbed and replaced by secondary formations. The dominance of Trema orientalis, a pioneer well adapted to seasonal desiccation, points to a much more accentuated seasonality after 2500 cal yr BP, which seems to be linked to a Southwards shift of the ITCZ during the northern hemisphere winter months. We propose that the rain forest crisis between 2500 and 2200 cal BP created favourable conditions for farming and paved the way for a major expansion of Bantu speaking Populations.

Late Holocene climate and environmental change in the Teuchitlan basin, Jalisco, Mexico	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												A 116 cm sediment sequence from paleolake Teuchitlan provided information for the last 4000 years related to past climate and human disturbance in western Mesoamerica. Concentrations of Ti, Zr, CaCO3, and TOC were compared with their average values to infer variations in runoff, perturbation of sediments, lakewater salinity and productivity in the basin. During the first half of the Late Holocene (similar to 4.0-1.9 ka), conditions were generally dry. Highest abundance of CaCO3 occurred at 3.95-3.90, 3.85-3.55, and 3.35-3.05 ka, and below-average transport of Ti-bearing clastic minerals during 2.75-2.15 ka indicates arid conditions within this generally drier interval of the Late Holocene. Southward migration of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, summer insolation and increased ENSO activity influenced summer precipitation and overall hydrologic variations during this interval. During the time period 1.9-0.3 ka (100-1600 CE), Ti, Zr and K indicate a mixed source, from the Early Classic (100 CE) until the end of the Postclassic (1600 CE), during a period of increasingly moist conditions. Enhanced evidence of human activities is related to agricultural practices during the Classic, Epiclassic and Postclassic Periods, associated with greater transport of allochthonous sediments from both nearby and distant sources. The Colonial-Industrial Period (1600-2017 CE) was characterized by an increase in human activities, with periodic additions of materials for agriculture in the region.

Carbon dioxide emissions from an oligotrophic temperate lake: An eddy covariance approach	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In recent years, several studies have suggested that most lakes are net carbon sources to the atmosphere rather than carbon sinks. Quantifying and understanding the environmental drivers of carbon dioxid e(CO2) flux from lakes is important in order to have a better understanding of the current and future greenhouse-gas budget of aquatic systems and the global ecosystem as a whole. In this study, we presentobservations of CO2 fluxes in an oligotrophic lake in Northern Michigan during two full growing seasons. We used the eddy covariance technique to measure continuous fluxes of CO2 and calculate the advective fluxes between the lake and the surrounding forest. We found that, at our measurement location far from shore, to the effects of horizontal advection were significantly lower than EC-observed vertical turbulent fluxes and contributed minimally to estimate of the seasonal totals. We found that during the summers the lake was an overall net carbon source, though at rates at much lower magnitude thannear by terrestrial ecosystems. Using a hierarchical modelling approach, we determined that net carbon flux from the lake is primarily correlated with wind speed, indicating the key role of mixing in the upper water layer. Variables indicative of microbial activity and lake gas storage were more highly correlated with the positive fraction of carbon flux than with carbon uptake. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Climate change impacts on lake thermal dynamics and ecosystem vulnerabilities	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Using water column temperature records collected since 1968, we analyzed the impacts of climate change on thermal properties, stability intensity, length of stratification, and deep mixing dynamics of Lake Tahoe using a modified stability index (SI). This new SI is easier to produce and is a more informative measure of deep lake stability than commonly used stability indices. The annual average SI increased at 16.62 kg/m(2)/decade although the summer (May-October) average SI increased at a higher rate (25.42 kg/m(2)/decade) during the period 1968-2014. This resulted in the lengthening of the stratification season by approximately 24 d. We simulated the lake thermal structure over a future 100 yr period using a lake hydrodynamic model driven by statistically downscaled outputs of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Model (GFDL) for two different green house gas emission scenarios (the A2 in which greenhouse-gas emissions increase rapidly throughout the 21st Century, and the B1 in which emissions slow and then level off by the late 21st Century). The results suggest a continuation and intensification of the already observed trends. The length of stratification duration and the annual average lake stability are projected to increase by 38 d and 12 d and 30.25 kg/m(2)/decade and 8.66 kg/m(2)/decade, respectively for GFDLA2 and GFDLB1, respectively during 2014-2098. The consequences of this change bear the hallmarks of climate change induced lake warming and possible exacerbation of existing water quality, quantity and ecosystem changes. The developed methodology could be extended and applied to other lakes as a tool to predict changes in stratification and mixing dynamics.					; Forrest, Alexander/C-3765-2014; Dettinger, Michael/JAC-9558-2023	Dettinger, Michael/0000-0002-7509-7332; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2016	61	2					496	507		10.1002/lno.10228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10228													WOS:000390706800005
J	Allen, G; Rector, L				Allen, George; Rector, Lisa			Characterization of Residential Woodsmoke PM2.5 in the Adirondacks of New York	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH												Although woodsmoke from residential wood heating can be the dominant source of winter PM2.5 in rural areas, routine monitoring is done primarily in urban or suburban areas. To obtain data on elevated woodsmoke concentrations from nearby sources, the PM2.5, black carbon at 880 and 370 nm, particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and wind speed and direction were measured during winter at three residential locations in Saranac Lake, New York. A paired-site design enabled the identification of local sources relative to larger spatial scales. With the exception of occasional regional PM events, the hourly measurements of this pollutant between the paired sites exhibited poor correlations, suggesting that local woodsmoke was responsible for the observed increases in PM values. One location that was adjacent to a residence with a wood stove, which was 40 meters from the monitoring site, experienced repeated episodes of elevated PM2.5 concentrations, with a maximum 3-hour average of 150 mu g m(-3), a maximum 24-hour rolling average of 64 mu g m(-3), and a maximum midnight-to-midnight average of 46 mu g m(-3). Despite these PM events, the data indicated that this location was likely in compliance with the current U.S. EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5. The daily PM2.5 concentration peaked and troughed during the nighttime and the daytime, respectively, at all of the sites, which is consistent with local ground-level pollution sources, such as woodsmoke; this diel pattern was also confirmed by Aaethalometer Delta-C (DC) data, a woodsmoke PM indicator. The particle-bound PAH data was less specific than the DC data to the PM in the woodsmoke, partly because the instrument for the former also responds to traffic pollution. One site repeatedly displayed the influence of 2-cycle engine snowmobile exhaust during the early evening hours, with very high PAH concentrations but only modestly elevated DC concentrations. Subsequent tests showed that fresh 2-cycle small engine exhaust produces a somewhat weaker response than woodsmoke in the DC in terms of the concentration per unit of PM.

J	Neto, JOAG; Aguiar, TR				Andrade Guimaraes Neto, Jose Osmar; Aguiar Jr, Terencio Rebello			Evaluation of the efficiency of three different mineral adsorbents in the removal of pollutants in samples from a tropical spring in Northeastern Brazil	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Human water sources are increasingly threatened around the world due to various sources of pollution such as agriculture and industry. The objective of this study was to evaluate three new adsorbents as pollutant remedies for subsequent application in the Joanes River located in the State of Bahia in Brazil. The specific pollutants were nitrogen, phosphorus (P), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), cyanobacteria, and saxitoxins. Initially, studies (pH 7 and 22 degrees C) were performed with samples contaminated in the laboratory with phosphorus (P), nitrate (NO3-), and ammonia (NH3), to select the most efficient adsorbent and to determine the equilibrium time. Pumice bituminous coal was found to have the best efficiencies (>= 70%) at 360 min (equilibration time). The experimental data did not fit the Langmuir and Freundlich model. The bituminous coal with pumice stone was then applied to water samples from a designated capture point of the Joanes springs, a river system that is responsible for supplying the city of Salvador and the metropolitan region, located on the northern coast of Bahia. The removal efficiency analyses were performed on a DR6000 UV/VIS SPECTROPHOTOMETER, using the methodology defined in the Standard Methods 2017, after which this adsorbent was subjected to scanning electron microscopy. As a result, removal efficiencies (>= 98%) were obtained for all contaminants (nitrogen, phosphorus (P), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), cyanobacteria, and saxitoxins) as well as a highly heterogeneous layer pointed by SEM images, further demonstrating the adsorbent potential as a efficient alternative in environmental control after additional studies. Practitioner points Pumice bituminous coal has proven to be an excellent adsorbent for a wide range of pollutants such as phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonia, toxins, cyanobacteria, and metals. The adsorbent promoted a high reduction in phosphorus concentrations (3.40 mg/L to 0.01 mg/L), about 98% and 81% for cyanobacteria (12,850 Cel/ml to 2,560 Cel/ml). The adsorbent promoted a high reduction in concentrations of 98% saxitoxins (4.32 mu g/L to 0.2 mu g/L).

The increase in human population leads to more demand for water and degradation of the water bodies around the globe, resulting in scarcity of water. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of anthropogenic activity on the water quality of the Loktak lake. Water samples were collected seasonally, namely, monsoon, post monsoon, winter and pre-monsoon, during 2013-2014 from 10 sites. For each water sample, 20 physicochemical parameters were analysed using the American Public Health Association method. Furthermore, 11 significant parameter values were used to develop the water quality index (WQI). The result shows high concentrations of nitrite (5.45-11.83 mg/l) and nitrate (93.67-177.75 mg/l) in rivers which is beyond the permissible limit and higher compared to the Loktak. Highest turbidity was observed at Langthabal with 21 NTU, which is above the permissible limit. The WQI of the Loktak ranged from 64 to 77, while for rivers they ranged from 53 to 95, which indicates that the water is in a very poor state. The WQI values of rivers are higher compared with those of the lake, and it was identified that water from the rivers is a major reason for increase in pollution in the lake water. The study suggests the need for long-term monitoring of the lake aquatic ecosystem and identification of pollution sites for proper management of the lake water. The WQI is an important tool to enable the public and decision makers to evaluate the water quality of the Loktak lake.

Groves	BOTANY LETTERS					7th International Symposium on Extant and Fossil Charophytes	2016	Astana, KAZAKHSTAN					Nitellopsis obtusa usually inhabits deep lakes, where the plants display vegetative growth and survive through the winter. In the present study we investigated a shallow lake where Nitellopsis reproduces sexually; we were interested in the effect of light conditions, temperature and water level on sexual reproduction of the species and its ability to survive lakebed drying. We estimated the distribution of all macrophyte species each July from 2009 to 2014 and correlated annual variations with fluctuations in hydrological conditions. We also sampled a variety of morphological characteristics of N. obtusa plants in nine periods throughout the 2009 and 2010 growth seasons and related them to water depth, day length and accumulated heat energy (growing degree-day) at the date of sampling. N. obtusa population was negatively impacted by decrease of water level, probably through the combined effects of competition with fast-growing pioneer species and lack of intrinsic ecological requirements. The fertility of N. obtusa could be interpreted as a response to disturbance in external conditions, leading to the production of long-lived and drought-resistant oospores. Development of male shoots prior to female shoots and their persistence throughout the season probably optimize the fertilization process. Sexual reproduction seems to be controlled by light and temperature conditions. An alternative hypothesis suggests that fertile and sterile populations belong to two distinct ecotypes.

The fraction of surface area covered by ice and the timing of ice-on and ice-off therefore affects hydrodynamics and the seasonal development of stratification and related ecosystem processes. Multi-year model simulations of temperate lake ecosystems that freeze partially or completely therefore require simulation of the formation and duration of ice cover. Here we present a multi-year hydrodynamic simulation of an alpine lake with complex morphology (Lower Lake Constance, LLC) using the three-dimensional (3D) model Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D) over a period of 9 years. LLC is subdivided into three basins (Gnadensee, Zeller See and Rheinsee) which differ in depth, morphological features, hydrodynamic conditions and ice cover phenology and thickness. Model results were validated with field observations and additional information on ice cover derived from a citizen science approach using information from social media. The model reproduced the occurrence of thin ice as well as its inter-annual variability and differentiated the frequency and extent of ice cover between the three sub-basins. It captured that full ice cover occurs almost each winter in Gnadensee, but only rarely in Zeller See and Rheinsee. The results indicate that the 3D model AEM3D is suitable for simulating long-term dynamics of thin ice cover in lakes with complex morphology and inter-annual changes in spatially heterogeneous ice cover.

J	Crampton, WGR				Crampton, William G. R.			Ecology and life history of an Amazon floodplain cichlid: the discus fish Symphysodon (Perciformes: Cichlidae)	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												The discus fishes of the genus Symphysodon are popular ornamental cichlids that occur in floodplain lakes and flooded forests of the lowland Amazon Basin. These habitats are characterized by extreme seasonal fluctuations in the availability of food, shelter and dissolved oxygen, and also the densities of predators and parasites. Most aspects of discus biology are influenced by these fluctuating conditions. This paper reports an autoecological study of the western Amazonian discus S. haraldi (until recently classified as S. aequifasciatus). This species feeds predominantly on algal periphyton, fine organic detritus, plant matter, and small aquatic invertebrates. At high water it forages alone or in small groups in flooded forests. At low water it forms large aggregations in fallen tree crowns along lake margins. Breeding occurs at the beginning of the flood season, ensuring that the progeny are well grown before the next low water period. Symphysodon haraldi is an iteroparous partial spawner, reaches reproductive maturity within a year, and undertakes parental care of its eggs and larvae. The timing of spawning events, and/or the rate of brood survival, may be influenced by fluctuations in the flood level, resulting in a non-unimodal distribution of size classes for the subsequent 1+ cohort.

Framework for understanding the influences of wildlife water developments in the western United States	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Water both limits and supports life; as such, it is essential for life processes. Free water is a limiting factor for some wildlife species in arid regions of the world. In the western United States, management agencies have installed numerous water developments to benefit wildlife. Despite >50 years as an active management practice, questions have been raised concerning the efficacy and potential negative impacts of wildlife water developments. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding more generally how, when, and where water developments are likely to benefit wildlife that are intended to use such devices. We argue that five elements are fundamental to an integrated understanding of the use of water developments by wildlife: (1) availability of free water in time and space; (2) water state (free, metabolic, or pre-formed) used by wildlife; (3) seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns that influence the physiological need for water by wildlife; (4) behavioral constraints that limit use of otherwise available free water; and (5) proper spacing and placement of water developments for targeted species. These elements are intended to help guide research and management efforts concerning the influences of wildlife water developments.

J	Perry, KD; Cliff, SS; Jimenez-Cruz, MP				Perry, KD; Cliff, SS; Jimenez-Cruz, MP			Evidence for hygroscopic mineral dust particles from the Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation Experiment - art. no. D23S28	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Two collocated, eight-stage rotating drum impactors were deployed at Trinidad Head ( California) during the spring of 2002 as part of the Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation 2002 (ITCT 2K2) experiment. One of the samplers operated at ambient relative humidity while the other was operated at a relative humidity of 55%. The impaction substrates from these samplers were analyzed using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) to provide continuous measurements of the size-resolved aerosol elemental composition with 3-hour time resolution. The aerosol elemental composition data identified three significant mineral dust episodes near the beginning of the time series. The backward air mass trajectory calculations from the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the PM10 to PM2.5 elemental mass ratios are consistent with the long-range transport of mineral dust from Asian sources. The data from the paired ambient relative humidity and low-relative-humidity samplers show that the aluminum, silicon, and iron elemental mass distributions are a function of relative humidity. In each case, the elemental mass distributions shifted toward smaller sizes as the relative humidity was reduced. This behavior indicates that the mineral dust transported from Asia to the west coast of the United States is somewhat hygroscopic upon its arrival. The hygroscopic nature of the aged mineral dust should increase its ability to nucleate cloud droplets (i.e., act as cloud condensation nuclei). Measurements of transported Asian mineral dust made at a high-elevation mountain site in Oregon (i.e., Crater Lake National Park) during the spring of 2002 show a strong correlation between the silicon and sulfur elemental mass concentrations. The ratio of calcium to sulfur makes it unlikely that this coarse sulfur is derived from gypsum (i.e., CaSO4). Instead, it indicates that the coarse mineral dust most likely accumulates sulfate coatings either near the source region or during transport across the Pacific Ocean.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 2	2004	109	D23							D23S28	10.1029/2004JD004979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004JD004979													WOS:000225584600002
J	Carlucci, JR; Westrop, SR; Brett, CE; Burkhalter, R				Carlucci, Jesse R.; Westrop, Stephen R.; Brett, Carlton E.; Burkhalter, Roger			Facies architecture and sequence stratigraphy of the Ordovician Bromide Formation (Oklahoma): a new perspective on a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic ramp	FACIES												The Upper Ordovician (Sandbian; late Whiterockian to Mohawkian) Bromide Formation of south-central Oklahoma was deposited along a distally steepened ramp that descended into the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen (SOA). It provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine a spectrum of marine facies that extended from back ramp peritidal settings to the center of the basin. The depositional history and environmental context of the unit are reconsidered using lithofacies analysis and the characterization of sequence stratigraphic patterns at a variety of hierarchical scales. Inner-ramp (above fair weather wavebase; FWWB) lithofacies suggest deposition in a range of environments: tidal flat, lagoon, shoreface, semi-restricted shallow subtidal, and bioclastic shoal. Middle-ramp environments between FWWB and storm wavebase (SWB) are thick and faunally diverse, and consist of rhythmically bedded marls, wackestone, packstone, and shales. Outer-ramp environments (below SWB) are represented by either fissile tan-green shale or thin-bedded carbonate mudstone and shale. Ramp stratigraphy, facies associations, and bounding surfaces suggest that three third-order depositional sequences are present in the Bromide. They demonstrate the transition from a clastic-dominated ramp in the late Whiterockian to a carbonate-dominated ramp in the Mohawkian, and show that the deposition of the Bromide was considerably more complex than the simple transgressive-regressive cycle traditionally used to describe accommodation dynamics in the basin. Meter and decameter-scale cycles (high-frequency sequences) are a common motif within the depositional sequences, and the Corbin Ranch Submember records an important peritidal succession prior to a major sequence boundary with the overlying Viola Springs Formation. New correlations based on measured sections, outcrop gamma-ray profiles, and subsurface well-logs document a novel pattern where the middle Bromide depositional sequence 2 (Mountain Lake Member) expanded down-ramp, whereas the succeeding carbonate-dominated sequence 3 (Pooleville Member) was progressively removed down-ramp. This demonstrates the existence of a major, regionally angular unconformity at the base of the Viola Springs Formation that has implications for basin evolution. Other implications include the validation of high-frequency sequences as a model for elementary cycles in mixed carbonate-siliciclastic systems and, more regionally, documentation of a new depositional sequence at the Turinian-Chatfieldian stage boundary.

The role of snow in the thickening processes of lake ice at Lake Abashiri, Hokkaido, Japan	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To clarify the properties of lake ice at mid-latitudes subject to moderate air temperature, heavy snow and abundant solar radiation even in winter, we conducted field observations at Lake Abashiri in Japan for three winters and developed a one-dimensional (1-D) thermo-dynamical ice growth model. Using this model with meteorological datasets, we examined the role of snow in the ice thickening process, as well as the Lake Abashiri ice phenology (including the interannual trend) for the past 55 years to compare with high latitude lakes. The ice was composed of two distinct layers: a snow ice (SI) layer and a congelation ice layer. The SI layer occupied a much greater fraction of total ice thickness than that at high latitude lakes. In-situ observations served to demonstrate the validity of the model. Freeze-up and break-up dates supplied by satellite imagery enabled further model validation prior to the availability of field data (2000/01-2015/16). Based on both observations and numerical experiments, it was found that one important role of snow is to moderate the variability of ice thickness caused by changes in meteorological conditions. Furthermore, ice thickness is more sensitive to snow depth than air temperature. When applied to an extended 55-year period (1961/62-2015/16) for which local meteorological observations are available, the mean dates of freeze-up and break-up, ice cover duration and ice thickness in February were estimated to be 12 December (no significant trend), 17 April (-1.7 d/decade), 127 d (-2.4 d/decade) and 43 cm (-1.4 cm/decade). For this long-term period, while snow still played an important role in ice growth, the surface air temperature warming trend was found to be a strong factor influencing ice growth, as reported for the high latitude lakes.

Diversity and succession of pelagic microorganism communities in a newly restored Illinois River floodplain lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												While the success of restoration efforts frequently depends on reconstructing ecological communities, time series observations of community structure over the course of restoration are rare. Here, frequent sampling of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, planktonic protozoa (ciliates and testaceans), and zooplankton was done along with measurements of select physical and chemical parameters during the first year of ecological restoration of Thompson Lake (TL), an Illinois River floodplain lake not connected to the river. The primary objective was to describe the microbial composition, diversity, and seasonal dynamics in TL and compare these results to similar measurements made in a nearby reference lake, river flood-pulsed Lake Chautauqua (LC). Strong seasonal patterns in bacterioplankton diversity were observed for both lakes. While TL phytoplankton diversity was lower and blooms more erratic than in LC, ciliate richness and abundance patterns were similar in both lakes. Rotifers and microcrustaceans were about 5x more abundant in TL than LC, with copepods and cladocerans exhibiting a fall abundance peak only in TL. When compared to temporal patterns of planktonic microorganisms in the reference lake (LC), the microbial dynamics in a lake recovering from decades of agriculture and drainage (TL) reflect the instability associated with early stages of ecological restoration.					; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/B-7856-2017; Velho, Luiz Felipe/I-9130-2016; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Rodrigues, Luzia/B-7856-2017; Lemke, Mike/AFC-8860-2022; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/I-9130-2016	Lemke, Michael/0000-0002-3714-3617; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/0000-0002-0593-0931; Dungey, Keenan/0000-0002-9920-2280; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/0000-0001-8111-4955													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2017	804	1					35	58		10.1007/s10750-017-3327-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3327-8													WOS:000414375700003

Dryness of ephemeral lakes and consequences for dust activity: The case of the Hamoun drainage basin, southeastern Iran	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study examines the influence of changes in the water coverage in the Hamoun dry-bed lakes on visibility, dust outbreaks, aerosol loading and land-atmospheric fluxes over the region covering the period 1985-2005. The Hamoun basin, located on the southeastern Iran and western Afghanistan borders, has been recognized as one of the major dust source regions in south Asia and is covered by shallow, marshy lakes that are fed by the Helmand and Farahrood rivers. When the water in watersheds that support the lakes is drawn down for natural or human-induced reasons, the end result is a decrease in the water coverage in the basin, or even complete dryness as occurred in 2001. Then, strong seasonal winds, mainly in summer, blow fine sand and silt off the exposed lakebed, enhancing dust activity and aerosol loading over the region. Satellite (Landsat) and meteorological observations reveal that the water levels in the Hamoun lakes exhibit considerable inter-annual variability during the period 1985-2005 strongly related to anomalies in precipitation. This is the trigger for concurrent changes in the frequency of the dusty days, aerosol loading and deterioration of visibility over the region, as satellite (TOMS, MODIS, MISR) observations reveal. On the other hand, soil moisture and latent heat, obtained via model (GLDAS_noah-10) simulations are directly linked with water levels and precipitation over the region. The desiccation of the Hamoun lakes in certain years and the consequent increase in frequency and intensity of dust storms are serious concerns for the regional climate, ecosystems and human health.

An overview of aquatic vegetation in Serbia	TUEXENIA												The majority of aquatic vegetation studies in the Middle Danube Basin (Serbia) were done independently during the last two decades, including data from small areas, which resulted in several classification solutions. The main purpose of this paper was to develop a numerical classification of the aquatic vegetation in Serbia, without fitting the vegetation groups into the existing phytocoenological classification scheme. Datasets of (i) surface and subsurface vegetation of free-floating duckweeds, ferns, liverworts and bladderworts, and (ii) vegetation of free-floating hydrocharids, submerged occasionally anchored ceratophyllids and rooted aquatic vegetation were compiled from phytocoenological releves (974). In order to fill the geographical and methodological gaps of these datasets, additional data matrix (iii) was compiled from sample quadrats (1055), collected during the aquatic vegetation season (summer months) of 2009, 2010 and 2011 at 31 lakes in Serbia. The datasets were analyzed using SYN-TAX 5.1 program, by non-metric hierarchical clustering OrdClAn and the Goodman-Kruskal's gamma resemblance coefficient. The cluster analysis revealed 28 aquatic vegetation groups (VG), of which three have been recognized as new vegetation units for the area of study: VG dominated by Vallisneria spiralis and Potamogeton perfoliatus, VG characterized by Polygonum amphibium and VG with Paspalum paspaloides as a constant. Geographical ranges and constant, diagnostic and dominant species of vegetation groups were determined.					; Novković, Maja/GYJ-6824-2022; Cvijanović, Dušanka/W-2419-2019; Anđelković, Ana/MZQ-3273-2025; Vukov, Dragana/AIB-3969-2022	Pavlovic, Danijela/0000-0002-1365-7330; Andelkovic, Ana/0000-0001-6616-1710; Novkovic, Maja/0000-0002-7646-3998; Cvijanovic, Dusanka/0000-0001-8732-1269; Vukov, Dragana/0000-0001-9737-6538													0722-494X						2018		38					269	286		10.14471/2018.38.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.14471/2018.38.005													WOS:000447356800015

However, estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from reservoirs remain poorly constrained due to the absence of spatially and temporally resolved measurements. We performed high-resolution monitoring of CO2 emissions (F-CO2) in a semiarid hard-water reservoir to examine its seasonal and diel variability. Our results suggest that dissolved inorganic carbon input plays a central role in sustaining the surface water CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), which varies from 1076 to 4587 mu atm. Although the reservoir is moderately to highly productive throughout the year, it is a net CO2 source with F-CO2 values in the range of 308-1753 mg C m(-2) d(-1). This high CO2 efflux indicates that productive waters are not necessarily CO2 sinks. Both pCO(2) and F-CO2 exhibit clear seasonal and diel patterns. Surface water pCO(2) is highest in March and presents a consistent diurnal/nocturnal pattern with the daytime pCO(2) 6-13% lower than the nighttime pCO(2). High CO2 efflux is observed during the ice-thaw period, indicating the release of CO2 that was accumulated during the winter. CO2 effluxes are typically higher during the nighttime driven by aquatic metabolism, but episodic weather events (e.g., rainfall and strong winds) can significantly enhance CO2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern. Our study also shows that using only daytime measurements to estimate daily CO2 emissions would underestimate it by 9-25%. Hence, future global assessments should incorporate CO2 emissions from hard-water reservoirs and account for their seasonal and diel variability.

Richness and Elevation Patterns of a Stonefly (Insecta, Plecoptera) Community of a Southern Appalachian Mountains Watershed, USA	ECOLOGIES												Protected areas are relatively free of human disturbance, are especially common in montane regions, and provide opportunities to study native fauna and flora. Stoneflies are model organisms to assess present and future environmental changes. While stoneflies inhabit cold lakes and a wide size range of lotic systems, diversity is greatest in streams draining mountain landscapes. This study addressed seasonal and elevation patterns of a stonefly fauna inhabiting a protected landscape draining the eastern flank of Mount Mitchell, the highest point of the Appalachian Mountains, USA. In total, 58 species were collected with estimated richness values ranging from 63 to 65. Species determinations were assisted with an integrative molecular approach using the mitochondrial barcode gene. Sampling during spring yielded the most species seasonally. Although certain species were only found at lower or higher sites, several were collected from across a broad range of elevations. Roughly 1/3 (21 = 36%) of the fauna present is known only from the southern Appalachian Highlands region, including one species described as new during this study. The assemblage reported here, however, did not closely align with other Appalachian fauna. Overall, well-structured faunal research continues to be important in light of continuing habitat modifications and climate change.

All recorded GLOFs were classified into the regions of Alaska, Western Canada and USA, Central Andes, Southern Andes, Iceland, Scandinavia, Alps, Caucasus, Tian Shan, Central Asia I (west), Central Asia II (east), and New Zealand. In each of these regions, the influence of temperature and precipitation on the frequency of glacial flood occurrences was investigated. It was established that GLOFs occur mainly during the summer months and air temperature is their main triggering factor. Since the frequency of GLOFs is influenced by both temperature and precipitation, a gradual increase in the frequency of GLOFs is expected because of global warming, although the relative importance of each factor will vary across regions.																			0300-5402	2336-1980					2024	59	2					282	293		10.14712/23361980.2024.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.14712/23361980.2024.12													WOS:001389003400008

Exploring internal phosphorus loads and management interventions through Bayesian reservoir modeling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient for eutrophication in many lakes and reservoirs across the world. While most management strategies aim at reducing external (watershed) phosphorus sources, internal phosphorus loading (IPL) often receives less attention, as it is challenging to measure or estimate through modeling. Here, we present a novel approach to characterize internal loading dynamics, leveraging multi-decadal monitoring data and a mass-balance model developed within a Bayesian inference framework. The model performs well (R2 = 57 % and RMSE = 0.032 mg/L for total phosphorus) when applied to Jordan Lake, a segmented eutrophic reservoir in North Carolina, USA. Results highlight the dominant and increasing role of internal loading in summers (0.53 g/ m2/month), contributing nearly twice the external phosphorus loading. We also explore long-term lake warming scenarios that intensify fluxes both into and out of the sediment layer, but have little effect on water-column phosphorus concentrations. Additionally, we investigate long-term phosphorus dynamics under different management interventions. Our simulations demonstrate the potential for IPL mitigation (e.g., capping, dredging) to accelerate and sustain water quality improvements, particularly when paired with external loading reductions. The modeling approach is transferable to similar waterbodies, especially where there is a need to characterize internal phosphorus fluxes based largely on water-column monitoring data. It also provides a computationally efficient framework for making long-term, probabilistic forecasts accounting for future climate, anthropogenic impacts, and the gradual accumulation (or depletion) of phosphorus in the sediment layer.

Modeling the influence of open water surfaces on the summertime temperature and thermal comfort in the city	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Due to the combination of rapid global urbanization and climate change, urban climate issues are becoming relatively more important and are gaining interest. Compared to rural areas, the temperature in cities is higher (the urban heat island effect) due to the modifications in the surface radiation and energy balances. This study hypothesizes that the urban heat island can be mitigated by introducing open surface water in urban design. In order to test this, we use the WRF mesoscale meteorological model in which an idealized circular city is designed. Herein, the surface water cover, its size, spatial configuration, and temperature are varied. Model results indicate that the cooling effect of water bodies depends nonlinearly on the fractional water cover, size, and distribution of individual lakes within the city with respect to wind direction. Relatively large lakes show a high temperature effect close to their edges and in downwind areas. Several smaller lakes equally distributed within the urban area have a smaller temperature effect, but influence a larger area of the city. Evaporation from open water bodies may lower the temperature, but on the other hand also increases the humidity, which dampens the positive effect on thermal comfort. In addition, when the water is warmer than the air temperature (during autumn or night), the water body has an adverse effect on thermal comfort. In those cases, the water body eventually limits the cooling and thermal comfort in the surrounding city, and thus diverges from the original intention of the intervention.

J	NICHOLS, DS; NICHOLS, PD; SULLIVAN, CW				NICHOLS, DS; NICHOLS, PD; SULLIVAN, CW			FATTY-ACID, STEROL AND HYDROCARBON COMPOSITION OF ANTARCTIC SEA-ICE DIATOM COMMUNITIES DURING THE SPRING BLOOM IN MCMURDO SOUND	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The lipid composition of microalgal communities dominated by diatoms collected from the sea ice at three locations within McMurdo Sound during the austral spring bloom of 1989/90, was determined using gas chromatography (GC) and GC mass spectrometry. A range of C27-C29 sterols were detected. The major sterols found at the three sites were 24-methylcholesta-5,22E-diene-3beta-ol (Cape Armitage); trans-22-dehydrocholesterol, 24-ethylcholesterol and 24-methylenecholesterol (Erebus Ice Tongue); and 24-methylenecholesterol (Cape Royds). The difference in sterol profiles is believed to reflect the differing species composition at each site. The high relative levels (as % of total) of 24-ethylcholesterol at the Erebus Ice Tongue site (possibly related to Amphiprora kufferathii) supports the proposal that diatoms are a more probable source of C29 sterols in Antarctic lakes than are other algal groups or cyanobacteria. Changes in sterol composition over the course of the bloom were evident at the Cape Armitage site, particularly within the cellular free-lipid fraction. The major fatty acids identified were 14:0,16:0,16:1omega7c, 16:4omega1 and 20:5omega3 (Cape Armitage and Erebus Ice tongue sites); 16:0,16:1omega7c and 20:5omega3 (Cape Royds site). All sites demonstrated high levels of PUFA (40-50% of total fatty acids), with an average 20:5omega3 level of 21% Erebus Ice Tongue, 20% Cape Royds, and 17% Cape Armitage. Variation was also observed in the percentage of 20:5omega3 for the Cape Armitage community over the sampling period. Levels of 22:6omega3 were between 0.4 and 1% of total fatty acids for the three sites. A C25:2 isoprenoid hydrocarbon was present in samples from all sites, adding further evidence to the proposal that diatoms are probably a source of this and related isoprenoid alkenes in marine and coastal sediments.

The plume, generated from a warm source develops upward carrying a suspension of particles from the bottom. It is found that the vertical structure of the plume depends on the stratification of the water column, which in turn depends on the seasonal meteorological conditions. During the stratified period of the lake, the plume is constricted to the hypolimnion zone. At the beginning of the summer season, the plume reaches the bottom of the metalimnion meanwhile at the end of this season the plume does not. In the mixed period of the lake, the plume develops in the whole water column and reaches the surface of the lake, where particles accumulate and spread around the center. Measurements of the vertical fish distribution in the stratified period show that the plume can constrict the fish habitat due to an increase of suspended particles transported by the plume.

J	BAKKER, C				BAKKER, C			ZOOPLANKTON SPECIES COMPOSITION IN THE OOSTERSCHELDE (SW NETHERLANDS) BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STORM-SURGE BARRIER	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During the period of construction of a storm-surge barrier current velocities decreased strongly and the Eastern compartment of the basin obtained a lagoon-like character. The rotifer Synchaeta spp., already abundant in the neighbouring salt and brackish lakes, profited from this condition. Higher and less fluctuating salinities caused the estuarine character of this compartment to disappear in the post-barrier years. This was reflected in the obscured succession of some Acartia species: the estuarine A. tonsa dominated in pre-barrier- and barrier years during summer, while the marine A. clausi was abundant in the post-barrier Oosterschelde during that time. Also the changed food conditions (Bakker & Vink, 1993) may have played a role in this phenomenon. Further changes in species composition were hardly observed. The main changes were of a quantitative nature (Bakker & Van Rijswijk, 1993; Tackx et al., 1993). A list of the commonly occurring species is given.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 6	1994	283						117	126																WOS:A1994NQ71100011

However, studies on small ponds, particularly those used for rice cultivation, are limited. This study analyzed the vertical water quality profiles, including the bioavailable Caesium-137 (137Cs) in an irrigation small pond classified as discontinuous cold polymictic based on water mixing type, and subjected to a high (2.0 MBq m-2) deposition of 137Cs and evaluated their potential risk associated with agricultural use. During 2014-2015, the suspended and dissolved concentrations of 137Cs in the pond water ranged from 0.10 to 7.7 Bq L-1 and 0.03-0.88 Bq L-1, respectively. The elution of dissolved 137Cs from the bottom sediment occurred only during the summer when the water temperature exceeded 15 degrees C, NH4+ increased, and dissolved oxygen decreased. Except during flood inflow mixing events, the activity concentration of dissolved 137Cs in the bottom layer did not increase in the surface layer at depths <= 1.0 m. In a 3 m shallow pond without a well-defined thermocline, a gradual density stratification primarily occurred in the lower layer during summer, limiting the transport of dissolved 137Cs from the bottom to the surface layer. About 5 % of 137Cs in the suspended solids and bottom sediment are exchangeable, indicating the mica-rich soils and geological conditions with a high fixation capacity of 137Cs reduce the risk of 137Cs elution. Even after three to four years of considerable depositions, the risk of radiocaesium absorption by paddy rice and subsequent increase in radiocaesium concentration in brown rice was negligible as long as the surface water of the pond was used for agriculture.

J	Chen, YZ; Lin, WQ; Zhu, JR; Lu, SQ				Chen Yizhong; Lin Weiqing; Zhu Jianrong; Lu Shiqiang			Numerical simulation of an algal bloom in Dianshan Lake	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												A hydrodynamic model and an aquatic ecology model of Dianshan Lake, Shanghai, were built using a hydrodynamic simulation module and the water quality simulation module of Delft3D, which is an integrated modelling suite offered by Deltares. The simulated water elevation, current velocity, and direction were validated with observed data to ensure the reliability of hydrodynamic model. The seasonal growth of different algae was analyzed with consideration of observed and historical data, as well as simulated results. In 2008, the dominant algae in Dianshan Lake was Bacillariophyta from February to March, while it was Chlorophyta from April to May, and Cyanophyta from July to August. In summer, the biomass of Cyanophyta grew quickly, reaching levels much higher than the peaks of Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. Algae blooms primarily occurred in the stagnation regions. This phenomenon indicates that water residence time can influence algal growth significantly. A longer water residence time was associated with higher algal growth. Two conclusions were drawn from several simulations: reducing the nutrients inflow had little effect on algal blooms in Dianshan Lake; however, increasing the discharge into Dianshan Lake could change the flow field characteristic and narrow the range of stagnation regions, resulting in inhibition of algal aggregation and propagation and a subsequent reduction in areas of high concentration algae.					chen, yizhong/G-2485-2016	chen, yizhong/0000-0002-1552-1162													0254-4059	1993-5005				JAN	2016	34	1					231	244		10.1007/s00343-015-4298-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4298-0													WOS:000370345300023

Here we merge bacterial and algal lipid biomarkers (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers and long-chain alkenones, respectively) to quantify Holocene temperature change from a small lake in northwest Iceland. Our local proxy record shows that early Holocene and late Holocene temperatures ranged from 3.2 to -1.1 degrees C relative today, which are in close agreement with independent estimates from regional ice cap models. At 2.4 ka, we observe abrupt cooling across bacteria-, algae-, and glacier-derived proxy records, which may have been initiated by extratropical volcanism and/or ocean/atmospheric climate variability of the North Atlantic region. Using early Holocene warmth and ice cap demise as an analog for modern climate change, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change temperature projections suggest that the local ice cap, Drangajokull, could vanish by similar to 2050 CE.

Development of a mobile phone application for the prediction of harmful algal blooms in inland lakes	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Harmful algal blooms mainly caused by cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems often present a health risk to the public within eutrophied shallow lakes due to algal toxins released into the water during the final stage of an algal bloom. Thus, algal growth should be carefully monitored during the summer season, especially in frequented recreational areas. Traditionally, water samples must be sent to a lab to analyze the data to predict algal blooms, costing time and money. Models on a smartphone predicting harmful algal blooms from easily measurable parameters could help individuals to take precautionary measures in order to prevent health risks from drinking and bathing in water and help to raise public awareness. In this work we present a mobile smartphone application that generates a prediction of the likelihood of an algal bloom from a variety of easily-measured input parameters that could be obtained by an informed smartphone user with simple instruments. Our model was implemented in an Android mobile phone application using App Inventor. The model we use is based on the Verhulst equation and allows users to enter any of the following measurements to predict and algal bloom: surface temperature, inverse Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen (DO) at the surface, and chlorophyll fluorescence (Chl-a). Our model was developed using a data set by weekly sampling of eutrophication parameters (temperature, conductivity, DO, phosphate, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, Chl-a, Secchi depth) during the summer season of 2013 (June-October) from a shallow lake situated in a recreational area within the town of Wolfenbuttel, Germany. Temperature differences within water depth layers were observed in mid-June, then partial circulation of the upper three water layers was reached in mid-August until temperatures gradually reached equilibrium at the beginning of August (full circulation). This coincided with full development of algal bloom (cyanobacterial Chl-a values reaching 40 mu g L-1), Secchi depth values below 0.6 m and a sharp drop in phosphate and ammonia levels within the bottom water layer. Thus, phosphate concentration at lake bottom, temperature difference between water layers, and surface temperature were recognized as valuable parameters for a simple prediction model of harmful algal growth based on the Verhulst equation N-t = N-0 + (k-N-0)*exp(-r(0)*t). A partial least square analysis revealed parameters for estimation of chlorophyll fluorescence (total Chl-a (mu g L-1) = -6.4775 + 21.6396 * inverse Secchi depth (m) + 0.0006 * square (DO surface (%); r(2) = 0.69) as well as cyanobacterial chlorophyll fluorescence (cyanobacterial Chl-a (mu g L-1) = 0.409-0.7486 * surface temperature (degrees C) + 17.6979 * inverse Secchi depth (m); r(2) = 0.76) from this data set. From these datasets and models, we created a single model that uses Secchi depth in combination with either DO or temperature at the surface to predict algae blooms.																			1863-9135					MAY	2016	188	1					1	17		10.1127/fal/2016/0722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2016/0722													WOS:000377177700001

Species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaver, H') were measured monthly from stations at the surface of each lake. Changes in the Chlorococcales community structure were examined with nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations. A total of 36 Chlorococcales species were identified in these lakes located in the Kizilirmak Delta. While the Chlorococcales composition was similar in Tatli, Gici, and Liman lakes, Cernek Lake showed different seasonal trends, indicating high species richness. Ankistrodesmus falcatus and Kirchneriella obesa were important in terms of their contribution to the total Chlorococcales present in Tatli, Gici, and Liman lakes, and Monoraphidium irregulare had high concentrations among the Chlorococcales in Cernek Lake. There were clear increases in the species richness of Monoraphidium and Ankistrodesmus in all lakes during winter compared with other seasons.

Stromatolite formation by Anaerolineae-dominated microbial communities in hot spring travertine in North Sumatra, Indonesia	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The travertine deposits could provide a prospective geomicrobiological snapshot of the early Earth considering its similarity with ancient stromatolites. Herein, we investigated the travertine carbonate deposits in a calcareous and sulfidic hot spring at Sipoholon, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, with an emphasis on the formation of a lam-inated texture similar to one observed in the stromatolites. The travertine deposits were associated with micro-bial mats of different colors that change from yellow, pink, and green, lowering water temperature and H2S concentration along the water passages. A phylotype analysis of the Prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene revealed that chemolithoautotrophic sulfur and hydrogen oxidizing bacteria were abundant in the yellow sediment around vent sites. At the same time, photoheterotrophs, a linage of Anaerolineae, dominated the pink to green sediment at mid-to downstream. Laminated textures are developed in pink and green-colored sediments among these cat-egories. Monitoring water chemical parameters and sediment texture for an Anaerolineae-dominated sample col-lected from a midstream site revealed that daily lamination was formed due to the daytime biofilm formation under the stable chemical composition of water conditions except for dissolved oxygen concentration. Daily lam-inations were also formed in other samples by microbial communities with lower Anaerolineae abundance. Fur-ther, the results showed that if mineral precipitation and microbial growth rates are appropriately balanced, cyanobacteria were not essential for the lamina development. This indicating that such a geochemical system could occur in early-time stromatolites even before the evolution of cyanobacteria. The microbial-mineral precip-itation systems identified in this study provide significant insights into the formation of stromatolites, which can in turn shed light on the history of early Earth.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Temporal Characterization of Dust Activity in the Central Patagonia Desert (Years 1964-2017)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Dust emitted from the southern end of South America (SSA) is transported long distances over the Southern Ocean and deposited over this marine ecosystem. Whether the nutrients released through dissolution have a biogeochemical impact is a question with biological as well as climate implications, yet there is no clear answer. Additionally, the provenance of dust recently found in accumulated snow in East Antarctica is still a matter of debate. The Patagonia desert in SSA is the likely source, but there are no detailed records documenting dust activity in this area, thereby preventing any definite assessments. Here we provide a survey of modern dust activity of the largest dust source in SSA, the lake Colhue Huapi in central Patagonia. We analyzed five decades (1964-2017) of surface synoptic observations (World Meteorological Weather Present weather codes) and concurrent satellite aerosol detection (UV Aerosol Index from the Total Ozone Monitoring Sensor and Ozone Monitoring Instrument detectors, 1978-2017). We assessed the seasonal, year-to-year variability and periods of major dust activity. Several periods of enhanced activity were found with roughly 2- to 10-year duration each (1970-1976, 1989-1994, 1996-1997, and 1999-2017). While dust activity peaks during summer months, wintertime activity during the most active years can well exceed the summer average of nonactive years. For a period of coincident satellite observations, the occurrence of at least three periods of high activity is confirmed. Since satellite detection is more sensitive to mesoscale dust events, the large events that occurred during these periods brought abundant dust into the SW South Atlantic. Satellites with polar orbits tend to under detect dust events in this region. Significant cloudiness obstructs the direct view of dust, and dust activity tends to occur late in the afternoon after the overpass of polar satellites. These observations have a time span adequate for comparison with transport models and modern records of dust samples collected in East Antarctica. The results contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic of modern dust transport in the Southern Hemisphere, the provenance of dust found in Antarctica, and the provenance of eolian nutrients into the Southern Ocean. Plain Language Summary Like a peninsula into the Southern Ocean, the vast Patagonia desert in the southern tip of South America is the largest landmass present in the high southern latitudes (40-60S). It is exposed to constant high winds, and dust blown from this region has important impacts thousands of kilometers away, yet these impacts are very difficult to assess. Questions such as the sources of dust found in snow in East Antarctica as well as the provenance of nutrients in the Southern Ocean marine ecosystem remain unanswered. While the Patagonia desert is the likely source there is a dearth of observational records of dust activity from this desert. This study fills the gap in observations by providing a record of 50years of surface and satellite observations of the largest and most active dust source in Patagonia: lake Colhue Huapi. The seasonality, frequency, and periods of major dust activity are identified from meteorological records at a station located 100-km downwind from the lake. Collocated satellite observations confirmed the major periods of dust activity in the last 30years. This data set provides information on how to interpret records of recent dust found in East Antarctica snow as well as help to understand the CO2 cycle in the Southern Ocean.

Climate Change and the World's "Sacred Sea"-Lake Baikal, Siberia	BIOSCIENCE												Lake Baikal-the world's largest, oldest, and most biotically diverse lake-is responding strongly to climate change, according to recent analyses of water temperature and ice cover. By the end of this century, the climate of the Baikal region will be warmer and wetter, particularly in winter. As the climate changes, ice cover and transparency, water temperature, wind dynamics and mixing, and nutrient levels are the key abiotic variables that will shift, thus eliciting many biotic responses. Among the abiotic variables, changes in ice cover will quite likely alter food-web structure and function most because of the diverse ways in which ice affects the lake's dominant primary producers (endemic diatoms), the top predator (the world's only freshwater seal), and other abiotic variables. Melting permafrost will probably exacerbate the effects of additional anthropogenic stressors (industrial pollution and cultural eutrophication) and could greatly affect ecosystem functioning.

The obtained age, 16 +/- 4 ka (2sigma), is older than that of the trachytic volcanoes of the Chaine des Puys, the ashes of which have already been locally recognised in the region. Its analysis confirms its originality. In the course of the comparisons made to search for its spring, it appears that the wide-dispersion tephra CF7, beforehand correlated by hypothesis to the Puy de Clierzou, probably originates from the Kilian crater or the Puy de Vasset.

J	Funder, S; Demidov, I; Yelovicheva, Y				Funder, S; Demidov, I; Yelovicheva, Y			Hydrography and mollusc faunas of the Baltic and the White Sea-North Sea seaway in the Eemian	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Palynologically dated mollusc and cirriped faunas from a region extending from the North Sea through the Baltic and Karelia to the Arkhangelsk region show that the hydrography of the Baltic was very different from the Holocene. For 2-2.5 ka in the Early Eemian a seaway existed from the Barents to the North Sea through Karelia, until it was severed at the present continental watershed to the north of Lake Onega. After this the Ladoga-Onega trough remained an arm of the Baltic for several millennia. The benthic faunas are comparable to the Holocene, but their boundaries were displaced much further into the Baltic. Notable differences from the Holocene are the absence or rarity of the Macoma balthica biocoenosis, and the presence of cold Portlandia-dominated biocoenoses in Karelia. In the Belt Sea and western Baltic winter sea surface temperatures and salinity were higher than now by ca. 6degreesC and 15parts per thousand, and the distinctly brackish top layer was missing. At the same time cold bottom water (approximate to2.5degreesC) with a tendency to anoxia characterised the Karelian arm of the Baltic. Water exchange through this area was inhibited by the constriction to the north of Lake Onega, and the basin and threshold bathymetry. Water transport through the White Sea-Baltic seaway was too sparse to play an active role in the North Atlantic surface circulation or climatic change in the region. The high salinity and temperature in the Belt Sea and western Baltic persisted throughout the Eemian, and are explained by wider and deeper passage from the North Sea to Kattegat, wider straits through Denmark, higher salinity in the North Sea, higher evaporation, as well as more dispersed fresh water supply. The advection of oceanic water into the Baltic culminated in the Early Eemian, before the Carpinus zone, and probably resulted in an oceanic climate in the Baltic region, while at the same time cold winters produced cold bottom water in the Karelian arm.

J	Yin, YP; Xing, AG				Yin, Yueping; Xing, Aiguo			Aerodynamic modeling of the Yigong gigantic rock slide-debris avalanche, Tibet, China	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												On the April 9 of 2000, a gigantic rapid rock slide-debris avalanche occurred in Bomi, Tibet. Some 280-300 x 10(6) m(3) of material travelled 10 km within 10 min and dammed the Yigong River, forming a 2.9 x 10(9) mA(3) barrier lake. Wind tunnel testing was undertaken to determine the aerodynamic parameters involved, from the initial rock slide-fall to its point of impact. The paper reports the numerical analyses undertaken and discusses the significance of the air-cushion effect. It is concluded that Yigong rapid rock slide-debris avalanche "flew" in the air for about 12.9 s from its detachment from the source to its collision with the floor of the Zamunong gully at 3,317 m asl. The velocity of the avalanche mass at the point of detachment was some 81.8 m/s and the collision velocity approximately 117 m/s.

Historical Events That Spawned the Field of Plasmid Biology	MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM												This chapter revisits the historical development and outcome of studies focused on the transmissible, extrachromosomal genetic elements called plasmids. Early work on plasmids involved structural and genetic mapping of these molecules, followed by the development of an understanding of how plasmids replicate and segregate during cell division. The intriguing property of plasmid transmission between bacteria and between bacteria and higher cells has received considerable attention. The utilitarian aspects of plasmids are described, including examples of various plasmid vector systems. This chapter also discusses the functional attributes of plasmids needed for their persistence and survival in nature and in man-made environments. The term plasmid biology was first conceived at the Fallen Leaf Lake Conference on Promiscuous Plasmids, 1990, Lake Tahoe, California.

Paleoclimatic reconstructions for the region are predominantly derived from fragmentary terrestrial records. Here, we present a detailed environmental magnetic record for marine sediments from the western equatorial Indian Ocean, which constitute the terminal sink for eolian material originated from the Arabian Peninsula. The dominant magnetic minerals identified in the studied sediments include magnetite, maghemite, and hematite. The hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM), widely used as a proxy for the abundances of the high coercivity mineral hematite, has been used to track variations in the concentration of Arabian dust over the last 200 kyr. Dust concentrations are lowest during interglacial periods of maximum boreal summer isolation, and coincide with intervals during which lake and fluvial systems developed and speleothems formed across most of southern and central Arabia. Our results point to a sharp decrease in the production of dust due to the expansion of vegetation cover up to 30 degrees N during these periods. West African Monsoon appears to be the major source of increased rainfall across Arabia, while the Indian Summer monsoon likely contributed to enhance rainfall in the south and southeastern parts of the peninsula. Variation in the supply of Arabian dust were also driven by changes in high-latitude ice volume and atmospheric CO2, as indicated by highest dust concentration found during glacial periods. We interpret that the expansion of high-latitude ice sheets increased the global meridional temperature gradient, weakened the monsoon system, and resulted in a more southerly, colder and descending subtropical westerly jet, leading to the retreat of vegetation cover and the enhanced production of dust from the Arabian deserts. Our results highlight a link between the production of Arabian dust and orbital-scale climate variability, including both monsoon and northern hemisphere ice sheets dynamics.

Does hatchery rearing of lake trout affect their reproductive behavior in the wild?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Stocking of hatchery-reared fishes has been used with variable success as a management action to pro-mote the recovery of populations and species. The practice has been controversial for several reasons, including uncertainty about whether the hatchery rearing experience may affect reproduction after release. Fine-scale acoustic telemetry was used during three spawning seasons to test whether hatchery rearing affects the reproductive behavior of lake trout using a spawning shoal complex in northern Lake Huron. Within sex, wild-and hatchery-reared fish behaved similarly, but significant behavioral differ-ences occurred between sexes. Lake trout of both sexes moved synchronously onto the spawning shoals at the completion of autumn thermal turnover and occupied the same spawning sites (confirmed visually by presence of fertilized eggs) on the shoals. Male lake trout tended to congregate directly on spawning sites, with duration of occupancy varying greatly among years. Female lake trout spent less time on spawning shoals than males and congregated less at spawning sites on shoals. Most fish visited multiple spawning sites among shoals per season, with many making multiple transits among individual spawn-ing sites. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that hatchery rearing impairs spawning behav-ior of lake trout and, therefore, conclude that behavior deficiencies on the spawning ground are likely not an impediment to rehabilitation of lake trout in northern Lake Huron. Our study narrows the field of pos-sible impediments to lake trout rehabilitation in the Great Lakes and provides insights that expand the conceptual model of lake trout spawning behavior.

Krishnagiri reservoir, a moderately impacted tropical reservoir of India, is an important source of freshwater. However, eutrophication status due to anthropogenic activities is a major threat to this reservoir. This endeavour aimed to determine the spatio-temporal differences for selected (21) limnological parameters along with trophic status of Krishnagiri reservoir for its sustainable management. Samples (water and plankton) were collected from 11 sites covering entire reservoir during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon season. Limnological parameters showed some spatio-temporal variations, the season has more impacts on water quality than sites as evidenced by cluster analysis. Principal component analysis distinguished the seasons based on major influencing water quality parameters. The reservoir trophic status fluctuated from eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic. Water quality index showed that the reservoir falls under unsuitable category. Additionally, cyanobacterial bloom formation was observed in all the seasons, with dominance of Microcystis sp. This investigation can be used as a baseline for studies pertaining to nutrient and sediment loading, and immediate action is required for employment of integrated management plan to restore this aquatic ecosystem. The study also recommends strategies for sustainable management of the aquatic bioresources.

Charophytes were found in Milos, Sifnos and Serifos. In Milos, I found one saline lake with the species Lamprothamnium papulosum. On the beach of Kamares, Sifnos, I found two localities with slightly brackish water and with the species Chara corfuensis and C. vulgaris, of which C. corfuensis is endemic to the area. The locality on Serifos is a freshwater dam with C. globularis. The locality with C. corfuensis in Serifos should be protected as the species is threatened there.																			1790-045X						2007	7						109	113																WOS:000249908900011

With updated temperatures, a regional training set was used to develop a midge-based mean July air temperature (MJAT) inference model (r2jack = 0.71, root mean square error of prediction = 1.09 degrees C). The average inferred MJAT varied between 9.4 degrees C and 13.2 degrees C. During the late-glacial period, MJAT ranged between 9.4 degrees C and 10.8 degrees C, and the lowest MJAT (9.4 degrees C) is inferred at ca. 12.7 ka during the Younger Dryas. The transition into the Early Holocene was marked by an increase from 11 degrees C at 11 ka to 12 degrees C at 9.2 ka. Following deposition of the Mazama tephra, chironomid concentration decreased rapidly, and MJAT rose to 12.3 degrees C at ca. 7.6 ka. This change in chironomid assemblage may be due to the direct effects of the tephra on the surface energy balance. The reconstructed temperature did not track decreasing Holocene summer insolation but instead revealed Late Holocene warming, which is similar to a chironomid reconstruction in the eastern Sierra Nevada and a sea-surface temperature reconstruction from northern California.

In coastal waters, the nitrogen cycle can be significantly altered by rising temperatures and other factors derived from climate change, affecting phytoplankton and higher trophic levels. This research analyzes the effect of meteorological variables on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species in coastal inshore waters of a Northwestern Mediterranean region under climate change. We built simple mathematical schemes based on artificial neural networks (ANN), trained with field data. Then, we used regional climatic projections for the Spanish Mediterranean coast to provide inputs to the trained ANNs, and thus, allowing the estimation of future DIN trends throughout the 21st century. The results obtained indicate that nitrite and nitrate concentrations are expected to decrease mainly due to rising temperatures and decreasing continental inputs. Major changes are projected for the winter season, driven by a rise in minimum temperatures which decrease the nitrite and nitrate peaks observed at low temperatures. Ammonium concentrations are not expected to undergo a significant annual trend but may either increase or decrease during some months. These results entail a preliminary simplified approach to estimate the impact of meteorological changes on DIN concentrations in coastal waters under climate change.					; Temino-Boes, Regina/HLQ-2255-2023; Romero, Inmaculada/K-9007-2014; García-Bartual, Rafael/ABE-4484-2020	GARCIA-BARTUAL, RAFAEL/0000-0002-1811-8264; Temino-Boes, Regina/0000-0002-0499-9611; Romero, Inmaculada/0000-0001-7876-9328; Romero-Lopez, Rabindranarth/0000-0001-8704-9744													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR 15	2021	282								111739	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111739		FEB 2021						33461817					WOS:000618049500003

The composition of the water indicates the predominance of two main salts: CaCl2 and MgCl2 at a proportion of Ca:Mg = 3.1 (w/w). Traces of K+, Na+ and NO3 (-) are also detected, as well as Fe(III) complexes that give the water a characteristic yellow color. Density measurements, elemental analysis, thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction data are consistent with the composition and salinity determined. The water of this pond has a similar composition to Don Juan Pond, Antarctica, but a higher salinity, which can be explained in terms of temperature and solubility of the main components.					; Víctor, Eduardo/F-1289-2016	Perez Velilla, Eduardo/0000-0002-9476-5906; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				APR	2017	23	2					109	117		10.1007/s10498-017-9312-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-017-9312-z													WOS:000399092500003

Regression Model of Partial Pressures of PCBs, PAHs, and Organochlorine Pesticides in the Great Lakes' Atmosphere	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The gas-phase concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorine pesticides have been measured at six sites around the Great Lakes every 12 days since the early 1990s as part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network. After converting the concentrations into partial pressures, data from all of the sites were combined and fitted using a multiple linear regression equation that included time (indicating the effect of a chemical's regulation), atmospheric temperature (indicating seasonality of use or release), the human population within a 25 km radius of the site (indicating the effect of urbanization) and wind speed and wind direction (indicating the source of the chemical). The atmospheric levels of lindane (gamma-HCH), DDTs, endosulfans, and chlordanes were largely related to seasonality, with much higher levels in the warm summer months. The levels of Sigma PCBs, Sigma PAHs, Sigma DDTs, and chlordanes were related to urbanization (this was a secondary factor for the latter two), a result that was unexpected for the two pesticides. The levels of only two compounds, alpha- and gamma-HCH, decreased rapidly as a function of time; conversely, most other compounds are declining at much slower rates. Wind speed and wind direction were statistically significant but unimportant variables for most of the compounds.

J	Sickman, JO; Melack, JM; Clow, DW				Sickman, JO; Melack, JM; Clow, DW			Evidence for nutrient enrichment of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Long-term measurements (1983-2001) of nutrients and seston in Emerald Lake (Sierra Nevada, California) have revealed ecologically significant patterns. Nitrate, both during spring runoff and during growing seasons, declined from 1983 through 1995. Declining snowmelt nitrate was caused primarily by changes in snow regime induced by the 1987-1992 drought: years with shallow, early melting snowpacks had lower snowmelt nitrate concentrations owing to less labile N production in catchment soils and longer plant growing seasons. However, nitrate declines during growing seasons carried through the wetter years of 1993-2000 and are likely the result of increased P loading to the lake and the release of phytoplankton from P limitation. Contemporaneous with these changes was an increase in algal biomass and a shift from P limitation toward more frequent N limitation of phytoplankton abundance. Particulate carbon concentrations in the late 1990s were two- to threefold greater than in the early 1980s. These trends were reflected in a larger set of Sierra Nevada lakes sampled as part of synoptic surveys (n = 28). Between 1985 and 1999, nitrate decreased and total P increased in >70% of the lakes sampled. Our data suggest that lakes throughout the Sierra Nevada are experiencing measurable eutrophication in response to the atmospheric deposition of nutrients.

J	Wang, YF; Qin, JZ; Zhu, LJ				Wang, Yafei; Qin, Jianzhao; Zhu, Lijuan			The Okhotsk-Japan Circulation Pattern and the Heavy Rainfall in Beijing in 2012 Summer	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Using station precipitation and reanalysis data, we examined the evolution of the large-scale circulations associated with the heavy rainfall event that occurred around July 21, 2012 (721 heavy rainfall). This study focuses on a role that the large-scale circulations named "the Okhotsk-Japan (OKJ) circulation pattern" played in causing the heavy rainfall case. We found that the 721 heavy rainfall occurred under a background of the OKJ circulation that persisted for about 10 days. However, the pattern was different from the normal OKJ circulation, for this circulation pattern accompanied a blocking high between the Ural Mountains and the Baikal Lake. This difference resulted from the seasonal change of the basic flow. The related Rossby wave propagated eastward during the persisting period of the dominated OKJ pattern. This caused the development of a low-pressure system around the Baikal Lake and the weakening of a ridge around the Okhotsk Sea. The slow evolution of the OKJ circulation created a favorable environment for the moisture transport to northern China, assisting in the generation of the 721 heavy rainfall.																			1687-9309	1687-9317					2015	2015								483970	10.1155/2015/483970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/483970													WOS:000360734500001
J	Sullivan, KA; Mason, RP				Sullivan, KA; Mason, RP			The concentration and distribution of mercury in Lake Michigan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Total and particulate mercury (Hg) concentrations were determined for the water column of Lake Michigan as part of the EPA Lake Michigan Mass Balance Project. Concentrations for total Hg averaged 1.60 +/- 0.25 pM while the particulate was 0.60 +/- 0.18 pM (20-50% of the total). Overall, fluctuations in total Hg both spatially and vertically showed no consistent trends, while particulate Hg may have been affected by calcium carbonate precipitation in late summer and sediment resuspension late in the season. Dissolved methylmercury (MMHg) concentrations ranged from the detection limit (25 fM) to 210 fM and the particulate fraction was from 5 fM (DL) to 45 fM (2% of total Hg). Disserved gaseous Hg (DGHg) concentrations during one cruise averaged 140 +/- 85 fM. Incubation experiments suggest that biotic processes are primarily responsible for elemental Hg production (2.6-6.5% per day) in Lake Michigan. Overall, the cycling and speciation of Hg in Lake Michigan is more akin to that of the open ocean, than smaller lakes in the mid-western USA. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Richards, J; Moore, RD; Forrest, AL				Richards, J.; Moore, R. D.; Forrest, A. L.			Late-summer thermal regime of a small proglacial lake	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study was motivated by an interest in understanding the potential effects of climate change and glacier retreat on late summer water temperatures in alpine areas. Fieldwork was carried out between July and September 2007 at Place Lake, located below Place Glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. Place Lake has an area of 72000 m2, a single inlet and outlet channel, and an approximate residence time of 4 days. Warming between the inlet and outlet of the lake ranged up to 3 degrees C and averaged 1.8 degrees C, which exceeds the amount of warming that occurred over the 1?km reach of Place Creek between the lake outlet and tree line. Over a 23-day period, net radiation totalled about 210?MJ center dot m2, with sensible heat flux adding another 56MJm-2. The latent heat flux consumed about 8% of the surface heat input. The dominant heat sink was the net horizontal advection associated with lake inflow and outflow. Early in the study period, temperatures between the surface and 6-m depth were dominantly at or above 4 degrees C and were generally neutral to thermally stable, whereas temperatures decreased with depth below 6-m and exhibited irregular sub-diurnal variations. The maximum outflow temperature of almost 7 degrees C occurred in this period. We hypothesize that turbidity currents associated with cold, sediment-laden glacier discharge formed an underflow and influenced temperatures in the deeper portion of the lake but did not mix with the upper layers. Later in the study period, the lake was dominantly well mixed with some near-surface stability associated with nocturnal cooling. Further research is required to examine the combined effects of sediment concentrations and thermal processes on mixing in small proglacial lakes to make projections of the consequences of glacier retreat on alpine lake and stream temperatures.

In high mountain, originally fishless lakes, terrestrial arthropods are an important seasonal food resource for introduced fish. Here we investigate how brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) can alter the input of terrestrial arthropods in 10 high mountain lakes contrasting for their stocking history (with and without fish or manipulated for fish eradication). We used a food consumption model to calculate the minimum and maximum number or biomass of arthropods consumed by fish, and we found that they can exceed, by several folds, the number or biomass of arthropods sinking into the lakes, at least under the metabolic rates expected for fish for most of the summer. We interpret this result as an indirect indication that arthropods usually cannot overcome the surface tension at the lake surface and that fish can work as a vector across the water-air interface. We infer that pathways for dead and live arthropods to leave the lakes do exist and fish can transfer into the water column many arthropods whose fate was leaving the lakes, which may have overlooked ecological and conservation implications.					; Pasquaretta, Cristian/AAA-3364-2021; Tiberti, Rocco/AAM-7103-2021	Tiberti, Rocco/0000-0003-1617-8826; Rolla, Matteo/0000-0003-4045-8289; LIAUTAUD, Kevin/0000-0001-6164-8415; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	2018	75	9					1453	1464		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0121													WOS:000442595300009

The purpose of this study was on assessing the quality of historic gravity data observed on the bottom of the Gulf of Riga from 1966 to 1967 and on the frozen Lakes Vortsjarv and Peipsi from 1986 to 1987. For the evaluation of historic gravity datasets, new gravity campaigns were carried out on large ice-covered Lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv in winter 2009 and on the ice of sea along the Gulf of Riga coast in winter 2010. Scintrex CG5 and LaCoste&Romberg (LCR) G relative gravimeters in combination with GPS RTK positioning were used for determining gravity values and position of the survey sites. The measuring conditions in an open ice field are generally unfavorable for precise gravity surveys, since the determination of the mass sensor position of relative gravimeter is a challenge on top of the oscillating surface of ice sheet. Therefore special equipment and methodology need to be chosen to assure correctness of measurements and data processing. Gravimeters LCR G191 with variable-damping screw at the bottom and Scintrex CG5 (No 36 or 10092) with 6 Hz digital data recording system were used during these ice field campaigns. The recorded 6 Hz "raw" readings of CG5 proved to be particularly helpful for studying the effect of oscillating elastic ice sheet. The plot of these readings showed peak-to-peak amplitudes up to 160 mGal and the spectrum of the same data revealed that oscillations occurred mainly at frequencies from 0.05 to 0.35 Hz. Despite harsh environment, the uncertainty of gravity values about +/- 0.15 mGal (1.5.10(-6) m/s(2)) was achieved from the least squares adjustment of observation data. The evaluation of historic data on the basis of accurate control points from the new surveys revealed some larger discrepancies in the Gulf of Riga. However, no systematic biases were found in the study areas.

Microstis always showed a light-saturated photosynthesis-light curve. Both Pmax and the intial slope of the photosynthesis-light curve of Microcystis in early summer were very high, so it was concluded that Microcystis utilized both low and high light intensities efficiently. The Pmax of Microcystis was found to be a function of the water temperature except in August and September. The linear regression on the temperature-Pmax relationship discontinued at 11.degree. C, where the Pmax value dropped; Microcystis did not show photosynthesize below 4.degree. C. The initial slope of the curve was also descending below 11.degree. C. It is suggested that Microcystis changes its physiological properties below 11.degree. C. The highest value of gross production calculated for M. aeruginosa was 5.4 gC m-2 d-1 in July; the annual gross production was estimated to be 300 gC m-2 year-1 (i.e., 40% of the total primary production in this lake).																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1985	7	3					303	312		10.1093/plankt/7.3.303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/7.3.303													WOS:A1985AHN9700001

The hydrological connectivity between these depressions and the main lake has a major influence on the hydrologic function and ecological integrity of the lake-floodplain and associated wetland habitats. This study explored the water level fluctuations and water exchange processes between the Poyang Lake and three typical saucer-shaped depressions, using a 30-min temporal resolution of water level observations during 2015-2016. Our results showed that the water level correlation and hydrological connectivity between the main lake and its depressions displayed a strong seasonal and spatial signal. Temporally, the rainfall significantly influences the seasonality and frequency of water level fluctuations both in the main lake and the depressions. The correlation coefficient of the water level ordered from high to low occurred during the high-water period, the rising-water period, the falling-water period and the low-water period, respectively. Spatially, depressions with a shorter connection duration to the main lake are located at higher local elevation and at larger geographical distance from the main lake. Finally, we also discussed the implications of these findings and possible factors that could have caused these particular water regime characteristics and water exchange processes.

Potentially toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis wesenbergii, M. aeruginosa, Woronichinia naegeliana, Anabaena spp., Planktothrix agardhii) were observed to be the main component (70-94% total biomass) of the phytoplankton community, in which species composition was unstable and was very different between the 2005 and 2006 summer seasons. Generally, total phytoplankton, cyanobacterial biomass and total microcystin (MC) concentrations in the reservoir were much higher in 2006 than in 2005. The highest MC concentration (173.8 mu g MC-LR equivalent dm(-3)) was seen in 2006 during P. agardhii (Oscillatoriales) domination (max. fresh biomass 50.3 mg dm(-3); above 91% of phytoplankton biomass). Positive correlations between microcystin concentrations and cyanobacterial biomass suggest that populations of Nostocales and Oscillatoriales in 2005 and Oscillatoriales (P. agardhii) in 2006 may have been the main producers of MCs in the reservoir. The strong increase in P. agardhii biomass concomitant with a decrease in the total biomass of Chroococcales and Nostocales was responsible for the increase in MC concentration in the Siemianowka dam reservoir.					; Grabowska, Magdalena/E-2079-2018	Pawlik-Skowronska, Barbara/0000-0002-6485-2099; 													1730-413X	1897-3191					2008	37	4					23	33		10.2478/v10009-008-0016-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10009-008-0016-y													WOS:000267220700002

Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye (67 degrees 53'N; 66 degrees 19' E; 186 m a.s.l) is the largest and deepest freshwater reservoir in the Polar Urals, Arctic Russia. The diatom oxygen isotope interpretation is supported by modern (isotope) hydrology, local bioindicators such as chironomids, isotope mass-balance modelling and a digital elevation model of the catchment. The Bolshoye Shchuchye delta O-18(diatom) record generally follows a decrease in summer insolation and the northern hemisphere (NH) temperature history. However, it displays exceptional, short-term variations exceeding 5 parts per thousand, especially in Mid and Late Holocene. This centennial-scale variability occurs roughly contemporaneously with and similar in frequency to Holocene NH glacier advances. However, larger Holocene glacier advances in the Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye catchment are unknown and have not left any significant imprint on the lake sediment record. As Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye is deep and voluminous, about 30-50% of its volume needs to be exchanged with isotopically different water within decades to account for these shifts in the delta O-18(diatom) record. A plausible source of water with light isotope composition inflow is snow, known to be transported in surplus by snow redistribution from the windward to the leeward side of the Polar Urals. Here, we propose snow melt variability and associated influx changes being the dominant mechanism responsible for the observed short-term changes in the delta O-18(diatom) record. This is the first time such drastic, centennial-scale hydrological changes in a catchment have been identified in Holocene lacustrine diatom oxygen isotopes, which, for Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye, are interpreted as proxy for palaeo precipitation and, on millennial timescales, for summer temperatures.

Hydroacoustics (2002-04) and long-term oxygen data (1969-2004) have been used in conjunction to examine the habitat of Arctic charr in the north and south basins of Windermere, U.K., a temperate lake subjected to cultural eutrophication and subsequent nutrient management. 2. Since 1969 there has been a gradual decline in the oxygen concentration in the bottom waters of both basins of 0.03-0.04 mg L(-1)year(-1), resulting in up to 43% of the volume of the south basin having an oxygen concentration < 5 mg L-1 in the early autumn. 3. Hydroacoustic data indicate that most Arctic charr routinely avoid the upper 10 m of the water column irrespective of temperature, with the implication that an observed gradual warming of the lake has not yet directly impacted upon their habitat. 4. In recent years there has been a behavioural response of the Arctic charr population to migrate vertically to avoid oxygen concentrations < 2.3-3.1 mg L-1. Further, the depth of the lower bound of the Arctic charr population is shown to be highly correlated with the deep water oxygen concentration throughout the year prior to autumnal overturn.					; Winfield, Ian/I-6085-2012; Jones, Ian/E-5507-2015; Carse, Fiona/AFT-8658-2022	Carse, Fiona/0000-0002-7556-2046; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2008	53	2					393	402		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01902.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01902.x													WOS:000252393800015

This provides a unique opportunity for detailed investigation of lake system responses during periods of rapid climate cooling (YD onset) and warming (YD termination). The new varve record of Lake Goscia(z) over dot presented here spans 1662 years from the late Allerod (AL) to the early Preboreal (PB). Microscopic varve counting provides an independent chronology with a YD duration of 1149+14/-22 years, which confirms previous results of 1140 +/- 40 years. We link stable oxygen isotopes and chironomid-based air temperature reconstructions with the response of various geochemical and varve microfacies proxies especially focusing on the onset and termination of the YD. Cooling at the YD onset lasted similar to 180 years, which is about a century longer than the terminal warming that was completed in similar to 70 years. During the AL/YD transition, environmental proxy data lagged the onset of cooling by similar to 90 years and revealed an increase of lake productivity and internal lake re-suspension as well as slightly higher detrital sediment input. In contrast, rapid warming and environmental changes during the YD/PB transition occurred simultaneously. However, initial changes such as declining diatom deposition and detrital input occurred already a few centuries before the rapid warming at the YD/PB transition. These environmental changes likely reflect a gradual increase in summer air temperatures already during the YD. Our data indicate complex and differing environmental responses to the major climate changes related to the YD, which involve different proxy sensitivities and threshold processes.					; Slowinski, Michal/B-6546-2011; Płóciennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Słowiński, Michał/B-6546-2011; Plociennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018	Muller, Daniela/0000-0001-7458-7113; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Slowinski, Michal/0000-0002-3011-2682; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357; Blaszkiewicz, Miroslaw/0000-0003-4365-0938; Plociennik, Mateusz/0000-0003-1487-6698													0300-9483	1502-3885				APR	2021	50	2					535	555		10.1111/bor.12499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12499		DEC 2020											WOS:000598909900001

Discharge measurements were made at 12 stations. The effects of the floodplain on river discharges were investigated using the upstream and downstream discharge observations of the Gumara, Rib and Megech Rivers. The total annual runoff coefficients ranged between 0.23 and 0.81 in 2012 in the basin. Discharge varied depending on drainage density (r = 0.75), lithology (r = -0.72 for percentage of Tertiary igneous rocks) and land use/land cover conditions (r = 0.61 for dominantly cultivated land with no significant other land use types). Analyses revealed that the floodplain abstracted 809 mm of water with a corresponding increase in floodplain storage of 992 mm during the beginning of the rainy season (June to July) and released stored water starting from August until the middle of September. However, the annual water balance indicated that the runoff contribution from the Rib and Megech floodplains is negligible. But the floodplain downstream of the Gumara River showed a considerable runoff contribution to the river, also in relation to the presence of springs. The floodplain acts as storage of flood water, and consequently the magnitude of peak floods was on average 71% smaller downstream than upstream in the floodplain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we reconstructed vegetation, temperature, human impact and livestock over the past similar to 12,000 years from Lake Sulsseewli, based on sedimentary ancient plant and mammal DNA, pollen, spores, chironomids, and microcharcoal. We assembled a highly-complete local DNA reference library (PhyloAlps, 3923 plant taxa), and used this to obtain an exceptionally rich sedaDNA record of 366 plant taxa. Vegetation mainly responded to climate during the early Holocene, while human activity had an additional influence on vegetation from 6 ka onwards. Land-use shifted from episodic grazing during the Neolithic and Bronze Age to agropastoralism in the Middle Ages. Associated human deforestation allowed the coexistence of plant species typically found at different elevational belts, leading to levels of plant richness that characterise the current high diversity of this region. Our findings indicate a positive association between low intensity agropastoral activities and precipitation with the maintenance of the unique subalpine and alpine plant diversity of the European Alps.

The lake water has a temperature of 26-34 degrees C, pH = <0.5-1.3, S-tot = 2500-4600 ppm and Cl = 5300-12 600 ppm, and floating sulfur globules with sulfide inclusions are common. Sulfur oxyanion concentrations are unusually high, with S4O62- + S5O62- + S6O62- = 2400 - 4200 ppm. Subaerial fumaroles (<93 degrees C) on the lake shore have low molar SO2/H2S ratios (<2), which is a favorable condition to produce the observed distribution of sulfur oxyanion species. Sulfur isotope data of dissolved sulfate and native sulfur show a significant S-34 fractionation (Delta SO4-S-e of greater than or equal to 20 parts per thousand), probably the result of SO2 disproportionation in or below the lake. The lake waters show strong enrichments in O-18 and D relative to local meteoric waters, a result of the combined effects of mixing between isotopically heavy fluids of deep origin and meteoric water, and evaporation-induced fractionation at the lake surface. The stable-isotope systematics combined with energy-balance considerations support very rapid fluid cycling through the lake system. Lake levels and element concentrations show strong seasonal fluctuations, indicative of a short water residence time in the lake as well. Thermodynamic modeling of the lake fluids indicates that the lake water is saturated with silica phases, barite, pyrite and various Pb, Sb, Cu, As, Bi-bearing sulfides when sulfur saturation is assumed. Precipitating phases predicted by the model calculations are consistent with the bulk chemistry of the sulfur-rich bottom sediments and their identified mineral phases. Much of the lake water chemistry can be explained by congruent rock dissolution in combination with preferential enrichments from entering fumarolic gases or brines and element removal by precipitating mineral phases, as indicated by a comparison of the fluids, volcanic rocks and lake bed sediment. Flank springs on the mountain at different elevations vary in composition, and are consistent with local rock dissolution as a dominant factor and pa-dependent element mobility. Discharges of warm sulfate- and chloride-rich water at the highest elevation and a near-neutral spring at lower level may contain a small contribution of crater-lake water. The acid fluid-induced processes at Patuha have led to the accumulation of elements that are commonly associated with volcano-hosted epithermal ore deposits. The dispersal of heavy metals and other potentially toxic elements from the volcano via the local drainage system is a matter of serious environmental concern. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Edwards, TM; Toft, G; Guillette, LJ				Edwards, Thea M.; Toft, Gunnar; Guillette, Louis J., Jr.			Seasonal reproductive patterns of female Gambusia holbrooki from two Florida lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Apopka in central Florida (USA) is significantly contaminated with a variety of chemicals including anthropogenic nutrients, organochlorine pesticides like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and multiple congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Our laboratory has previously documented a number of reproductive abnormalities in alligators from Lake Apopka, compared with alligators captured from Lake Woodruff, a nearby reference lake. We conducted the present study to investigate if another native vertebrate, Gambusia holbrooki (eastern mosquitofish), is similarly affected. Adult female mosquitofish were collected from Lake Apopka and Lake Woodruff monthly for 16 months to document seasonal and lake-associated variation in reproductive patterns. In contrast to fish from Lake Woodruff (reference), females from Lake Apopka exhibited earlier and more synchronized spring ovarian recrudescence, increased body size, increased fecundity, increased adjusted hepatic weight, and more extreme fluctuations in muscle estradiol concentrations in most months. Endocrine disruption, consistent with other studies and Lake Apopka's pollution profile, is one explanation for these findings. Other environmental and physiological factors are also addressed. However, the higher fecundity among Apopka females suggests that, unlike Apopka alligators, Apopka mosquitofish are not impacted at the population level. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Populations are most dense in the middle of their distribution (driftline) and least dense at the landward and lakeward ends of the gradient. Survivorship and fruit production were highest on the lakeward end of the gradient and decreased landward. A majority of the fruits produced on plants close to the shoreline were dispersed landward by high waves. Several environmental and biotic factors, such as sand accretion, exposure of roots by sand erosion, desiccation, insect damage, disease infection and human trampling may be directly, or indirectly, responsible for seedling mortality.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1984	111	1					86	95		10.2307/2425546	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425546													WOS:A1984SB61700012

The influencing factors of odor compounds in reservoirs are still unclear. During August 2019, a nationwide survey investigating the distribution of odor compounds in reservoirs used as drinking water sources was conducted on seven reservoirs. 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) and geosmin were detected in almost every reservoir, and some odor compound concentrations even exceeded the odor threshold concentration. The average concentration of 2-MIB was 2.68 ng/L, and geosmin was 3.63 ng/L. The average chlorophyll a concentration was 8.25 mu g/L. The dominant genera of phytoplankton in these reservoirs belonged to cyanobacteria and diatom. Statistical analysis showed that odor compound concentration was significantly related to the chlorophyll a concentration and indicated that the odor compounds mainly came from phytoplankton. The concentration of odor compounds in the euphotic zone was significantly related to phytoplankton species and biomass. Therefore, the odor compound concentrations in the subsurface chlorophyll maxima layer was generally higher than in the surface layer. However, the odor compounds in the hypolimnion layer were related to the density current. This research suggests that both phytoplankton proliferation events and heavy storm events are important risk factors increasing odor compounds in reservoirs. Control of algal bloom, in-situ profile monitoring system and depth-adjustable pumping system will greatly reduce the risk of odor problems in reservoirs using as water supplies for large cities.					; ZHAO, Xianfu/AHC-4026-2022; Wu, Tianhao/GQZ-1682-2022; xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Yang, Jun/E-6680-2011; ZHAO, Xianfu/AHC-4026-2022; YANG, Jun/E-6680-2011	Wu, Tianhao/0000-0002-7044-6660; ZHAO, Xianfu/0000-0003-0746-2788; YANG, Jun/0000-0002-7920-2777													0269-7491	1873-6424				NOV 1	2021	288								117683	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117683	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117683		JUL 2021						34237652					WOS:000696805300010

The life cycle is composed of both 1 and 2 yr developmental sequences including diapause in the sediment. There are 3 main periods of reproduction, 1 occurring during the winter. The population in the plankton and in diapause in the sediments is restricted to the mixolimnion, the greatest concentrations being found close to the surface and to the chemocline for the plankton phase, and near the chemocline for the diapause phase. A fraction of the diapause population was found in the sediments of the monimolimnion.																			0003-9136						1980	88	2					178	201																WOS:A1980JU02400004

Hatch Timing Variations among Reservoir Gizzard Shad Populations: Implications for Stocked Sander spp. Fingerlings	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Growth and survival of stocked Sander spp. fingerlings can be influenced by timing of stocking in relation to the peak in density of larval gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum. However, coordinating stockings to coincide with peaks in gizzard shad density is difficult due to temporal variation in spawn timing among reservoirs. We used weekly estimates of larval gizzard shad density and length distributions to identify dates of peak hatching and peak total density in Ohio reservoirs and to explore the influence of spring water temperature regimes on timing of peak larval density. Gizzard shad density peaked over 21-32 d among reservoirs but generally varied by 12 d or less among years for any given population. Density peaks were driven by hatching, as larvae smaller than 10 mm accounted for a majority of the gizzard shad collected on the peak date. Peaks in gizzard shad density corresponded to water temperatures of 17-22 degrees C and occurred most frequently when water temperatures had been stable or rising. Reservoirs in the southern portion of the state were 2-5 degrees C warmer than northern reservoirs throughout the spring; thus. gizzard shad spawning and date of peak larval density were earliest in southern reservoirs and became progressively later for populations in more northerly reservoirs. Historical stocking dates for fingerling walleyes S. vitreus and saugeyes (sauger S. canadensis X walleye) in Ohio reservoirs indicated that southern reservoirs were often stocked after the expected peak in gizzard shad density and northern reservoirs were stocked before the peak. A statewide approach to stocking that incorporates latitudinal variations in gizzard shad hatch timing whereby southern reservoirs are stocked earliest would better align stockings with peak gizzard shad density, potentially improving survival of fingerling walleyes and saugeyes.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2009	29	2					488	494		10.1577/M08-141.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-141.1													WOS:000268505100025
