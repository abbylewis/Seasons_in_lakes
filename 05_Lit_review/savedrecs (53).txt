Current State of Water Resources of Gusinoe Lake (Western Transbaikalia)	WATER RESOURCES												Seasonal and spatial dynamics of the concentrations of major ions, biogenic elements, organic matter, and microelements in Gusinoe Lake water are studied. The economic activity on lake coast has caused an increase in the concentrations of sulfate, sodium, and biogenic and organic matter in areas subject to direct technogenic impact. Lake areas subject to different technogenic impacts were found to differ in water mineralization and pH and the concentrations of microelements. The concentrations of Mo and Sr in lake water are 12-14 and 2-4 times greater than Russian MACs for water bodies used for fishery, respectively.

With no specific warning, a disaster of this magnitude was not anticipated, and everyone was taken by surprise. The incidence also coincided with the peak of the tourist season when pilgrims, tourists, and others from across the country and abroad had gathered in the region in large numbers. The incidence thus resulted in a major tragedy of recent times in which human death toll surpassed 4000. The disaster was a major setback for the economy of the state to which tourism and pilgrimage are major contributors. Burden on public exchequer was further exacerbated by tax waiver and assistance provided to disaster-affected population even on losses that are not generally covered by State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Important lessons were however learned in managing this disaster, and these would go a long way in strengthening the disaster management system not only in Uttarakhand but also elsewhere.																			2196-4106		978-981-10-3310-0; 978-981-10-3309-4				2018							165	192		10.1007/978-981-10-3310-0_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-3310-0_9	10.1007/978-981-10-3310-0												WOS:000439783200010

This paper describes empirical algorithms for the estimation of these variables incorporating information from the Operational Land Imager Sensor on board the Landsat-8 satellite. Neural networks are seasonally trained using data from the Cefni reservoir (Anglesey, U.K.), covering a variety of physical trophic status. Chlorophyll-a levels and the suspended solids are estimated from the reflectance in band-2 and band-4, while the turbidity values from reflectance in band-4. Experimental results show the potential of Landsat-8 as a substitute of Landsat-7 in water bodies quality monitoring. Moreover, predicted values obtained by using wavelet artificial neural networks fit well measured data and hence, such models provide accurate results therefore improving the efficiency in monitoring water quality parameters and contributing to possible decision making processes in the environmental management.

The CLM was forced with 10 km resolution reanalysis data to attempt to understand detailed lake processes and how these processes affect lake surface temperature. In this study, we simulated seasonal and interannual variations of lake surface temperature for Lake Qinghai, Zhaling Co, and Nam Co in the Tibetan Plateau and compared these simulations with observations. The results showed that the CLM4.5 lake model simulations reproduced the observed lake surface temperatures for Lake Qinghai and Zhaling Co well but reproduced those for Nam Co poorly. Through detailed analysis, we found that the simulated biases for Nam Co result largely from the unrealistic parameterization of eddy diffusivity. By expanding this parameter, the lake surface temperature simulations improved remarkably. In addition, erroneous lake ice cover simulations contributed to the simulated lake surface temperature bias in the cold seasons.

The marked variation of the lake's surface water area is considered to have been affected by the TGR over the past decades. In this study, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI time-series imagery data were employed to estimate the wet season total surface water area variation in South Dongting Lake and East Dongting Lake from 1988 to 2016. The surface water area was extracted from Landsat data using Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The results indicated that the surface water area variation was accordant with the variation of precipitation and runoff of Xiangtan, Taojiang, Taoyuan, Shimen, Shadaoguan, Mituosi, Ouchikou and Chenglingji five hydrological stations. Most of the large surface water areas were observed during the pre-TGR period, whereas the small surface water areas were observed during the post-TGR period. Surface water area data, precipitation and runoff from the four hydrological stations (except Shimen station) all indicated downward trends, with reduction rates of 5.866 km(2).year(-1), 0.802 mm.year(-1), 3.950 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 2.834 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 0.377 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 1.282 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 2.715 10(8)m(3).year(-1) , 0.318 10(8)m(3).year(-1) and 16.114 10(8)m(3).year(-1), respectively. The results of correlation analyses indicated precipitation and water from the Yangtze river may affect the fluctuation in the surface water area to a large extent. The results of flood inundation probability analysis indicated that approximately 502.9 km(2) of the study area was in the high flood hazard zone. In addition, the results of this study can provide scientific information to understand the effect of the TGR on downstream lakes and achieve better water resources and flood hazard management in this region.

However, few studies have been carried out about how these wetlands, which act as buffer zones of pollutant sinks, can be operated to achieve optimal pollutant removal and cost efficiency. In this study, cores of sediments and water were collected from a lacustrine wetland of Lake Xiaoxingkai region in Northeastern China, to produce a number of lab-scale wetland columns. Ex situ experiments, in a controlled environment, were conducted to study the effects of aeration, vegetation, and iron (Fe) input on the removal of total P (TP) and values of dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH of the water in these columns. The results demonstrated the links between Fe, P and DO levels. The planting of Glyceria spiculosa in the wetland columns was found to increase DO and pH values, whereas the Fe: P ratio was found to inversely correlate to the pH values. The TP removal was the highest in aerobic and planted columns. The pattern of temporal variation of TP removals matched first-order exponential growth model, except for under aerobic condition and with Fe: P ratio of 10:1. It was concluded that Fe introduced into a wetland by either surface runoff or agricultural drainage is beneficial for TP removal from the overlying water, especially during the growth season of wetland vegetation.					zhang, linlin/JJE-0205-2023; Zou, Yuanchun/B-6666-2008	Zou, Yuanchun/0000-0003-1520-9678													2073-4441					JAN	2018	10	1							61	10.3390/w10010061	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10010061													WOS:000424397400058

In maar lakes, there is paleoenvironmental evidence of water level responses to climate and groundwater inflow changes; however, historical studies are scarce. Understanding the relative contributions of natural variability and anthropogenic impacts to the decline of lakes ' water level is fundamental to preserving these ecosystems. In this study, we developed a conceptual baseline of the response of tropical maar lakes to climate and groundwater variability at different time scales in near natural conditions. The four analyzed maar lakes are in a semiarid, endorheic basin in central Mexico and the study time frame (1959 to 1992) includes a historical period before direct human impact. We analyzed the effects of meteorological records, large-scale climate phenomena indices (ENSO, PDO, and AMO), and regional groundwater levels on WL datasets using multiple linear regression models, trend analysis and cross correlations. WL responded to meteorological seasonality and climate variability indices. All lakes lost more water to evaporation than they gained from precipitation, which partially explains long-term WL declines. Regional groundwater levels decreased, suggesting a reduction of groundwater inflow to the lakes, which contributed to WL declines. The latter may reflect a lagged effect of long-term recharge decrease, probably due to long-term climate change in the region since the formation of the lakes evidenced in previous studies. The results add to evidence of water level declines caused by groundwater -mediated natural variability, warning about how this process is being exacerbated by anthropic activities under the context of global change.

Microscopic features of the crust were investigated to understand processes of bloedite sedimentation. This study was combined with satellite and airborne observations, revealing asymmetrical concentric and parallel-linear patterns, related to wind action. Gypsum (CaSO4 center dot H2O) and glauberite (Na2Ca(SO4)(2)) in the calcareous sediments below the crust, and abundant eugsterite (Na4Ca(SO4)(3)center dot 2H(2)O) along the base of the crust, largely formed at a different stage than bloedite. The main part of the crust consists predominantly of coarse-crystalline xenotopic-hypidiotopic bloedite, but fan-like aggregates with downward widening, radial aggregates, surface layers with vertically aligned elongated crystals, and partially epitaxial coatings occur as well. The upper part of the crust is marked by a bloedite-thenardite (Na2SO4) association, recording a change in brine composition that is not in agreement with results of modelling of local brine evolution. A thin fine-grained thenardite-dominated surface formed in part by subaqueous settling of crystals, but there are also indications for development by transformation of bloedite. Surface features include fan-like bloedite aggregates with upward widening, formed by bottom growth. Overall, the Salada Mediana crusts record a complex history of bloedite and thenardite precipitation by various processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pearson, CJ; Bucknell, D; Laughlin, GP				Pearson, Craig J.; Bucknell, Delia; Laughlin, Gregory P.			Modelling crop productivity and variability for policy and impacts of climate change in eastern Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												A simple scalar crop growth index, GrowEst, was used to calculate plausible weekly crop growth indices for 101 sites over 40 years in eastern Canada. The experimental design allowed the calculation of regional growth and regional variability over time. The research is reported in three sections: development of GrowEst for eastern Canada, policy applications, and scenarios of the impacts of climate change. From the growth index we propose a single statistic, the median integrated seasonal growth index, MIGI to describe the overall fitness-for-growth of a particular site across years, or of a particular year across a geographical area such as eastern Canada. The growth index generally increased from 1960 to 2000 due mostly to increasing temperatures. When mapped, the highest potential growth was adjacent to the Great Lakes and along the St Lawrence River Valley. Variability through time was lowest at locations where the indices were highest. Comparison of these data with historical regional yields indicated that potential yields may not have been captured by current technologies. Two potential policy applications of GrowEst modelling were demonstrated: the determination of crop insurance payments taking account of potential yields and spatial variability; and in urban land-use planning. Future scenarios were calculated from five climate change models for time periods up to 2099. All scenarios caused increases in growth indices. Most predicted that the length of the growing season would increase by 5-7 weeks but that incidences of moisture deficit would also increase. We conclude that climate change is most likely to cause increases in potential productivity which may be largely negated by increasing moisture deficits. Opportunities are identified for innovation to capture current and future potential yield and to reduce yield variability. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Douglas			The plankton community of Lake Matano: factors regulating plankton composition and relative abundance in an ancient, tropical lake of Indonesia	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes	SEP 04-08, 2006	Freie Univ Berlin, Berlin, GERMANY		Freie Univ Berlin			Recent evidence reveals that food webs within the Malili Lakes, Sulawesi, Indonesia, support community assemblages that are made up primarily of endemic species. It has been suggested that many of the species radiations, as well as the paucity of cosmopolitan species in the lakes, are related to resource limitation. In order to substantiate the possibility that resource limitation is playing such an important role, a study of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities of Lake Matano was implemented between 2000 and 2004. We determined species diversity, relative abundances, size ranges, and total biomass for the phytoplankton and zooplankton, including the distribution of ovigerous individuals throughout the epilimnion of Lake Matano in three field seasons. The phytoplankton community exhibited very low biomass (< 15 mu g l(-1)) and species richness was depressed. The zooplankton assemblage was also limited in biomass (2.5 mg l(-1)) and consisted only of three taxa including the endemic calanoid Eodiaptomus wolterecki var. matanensis, the endemic cyclopoid, Tropocyclops matanensis and the rotifer Horaella brehmi. Zooplankton were very small (< 600 mu m body length), and spatial habitat partitioning was observed, with Tropocylops being confined to below 80 m, while rotifer and calanoid species were consistently observed above 80 m. Less than 0.1% of the calanoid copepods in each year were egg-bearing, suggesting very low population turnover rates. It was concluded that chemical factors as opposed to physical or biological processes were regulating the observed very low standing crops of phytoplankton which in turn supports a very minimal zooplankton community restricted in both species composition and abundance. As chemical factors are a function of the catchment basin of Lake Matano, it is predicted that resource limitation has long played an important role in shaping the unique endemic assemblages currently observed in the food web of the lake.

J	Matthews, B; Mazumder, A				Matthews, B; Mazumder, A			Consequences of large temporal variability of zooplankton δ15N for modeling fish trophic position and variation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We use a temporal integration model (TIM) to determine how estimates of trophic variation, using delta N-15, depend on consumer growth dynamics and temporal isotopic variation (delta N-15) of food sources. Consumers are rarely in isotopic equilibrium with their food sources, so instantaneous comparisons between the delta N-15 of a consumer and its diet provide little information about trophic variation, even if the trophic positions of the diet are known. In this paper, we focus on the trophic link between zooplankton and planktivorous fish. We first review the extent of temporal variability of zooplankton delta N-15, then examine the consequences of this variability for understanding the isotopic composition of planktivorous fish communities. We use time series of delta N-15 for Daphnia, calanoid copepods, and particulate organic matter (> 200 mu m) to generate theoretical diets for a model juvenile sockeye over a typical growing season. We use a TIM to predict the isotopic trajectory of individual juveniles feeding on these diets and explore how variance in growth rate and isotopic enrichment (Delta(delta N)) can affect estimates of trophic position and intrapopulation isotopic variability. In general, we found that using a seasonal average of Daphnia delta N-15 to estimate the trophic position of planktivorous fish is nearly equivalent to using a TIM. However, temporal variation in the delta N-15 of food sources, coupled with individual differences in the growth rate of consumers, can contribute to intrapopulation isotopic variation of consumers and lead to correlations between consumer size and delta N-15.

J	Bilgilioglu, BB; Erten, E; Musaoglu, N				Bilgilioglu, Burhan Baha; Erten, Esra; Musaoglu, Nebiye			Analysis of Salt Lake Volume Dynamics Using Sentinel-1 Based SBAS Measurements: A Case Study of Lake Tuz, Turkey	REMOTE SENSING												As one of the largest hypersaline lakes, Lake Tuz, located in the middle of Turkey, is a key waterbird habitat and is classified as a Special Environmental Protection Area in the country. It is a dynamic lake, highly affected by evaporation due to its wide expanse and shallowness (water depth <40 cm), in addition to being externally exploited by salt companies. Monitoring the dynamics of its changes in volume, which cause ecological problems, is required to protect its saline lake functions. In this context, a spatially homogeneous distributed gauge could be critical for monitoring and rapid response; however, the number of gauge stations and their vicinity is insufficient for the entire lake. The present study focuses on assessing the feasibility of a time-series interferometric technique, namely the small baseline subset (SBAS), for monitoring volume dynamics, based on freely available Sentinel-1 data. A levelling observation was also performed to quantify the accuracy of the SBAS results. Regression analysis between water levels, which is one of the most important volume dynamics, derived by SBAS and levelling in February, April, July and October was 67%, 80%, 84%, and 95% respectively, for correlation in the range of 10-40 cm in water level, and was in line with levelling. Salt lake components such as water, vegetation, moist soil, dry soil, and salt, were also classified with Sentinel-2 multispectral images over time to understand the reliability of the SBAS measurements based on interferometric coherence over different surface types. The findings indicate that the SBAS method with Sentinel-1 is a good alternative for measuring lake volume dynamics, including the monitoring of water level and salt movement, especially for the dry season. Even though the number of coherent, measurable, samples (excluding water) decrease during the wet season, there are always sufficient coherent samples (>0.45) over the lake.					; Bilgilioglu, Burhan/ABY-2317-2022; Erten, Esra/ABC-7914-2020; MUSAOGLU, NEBIYE/HSH-3813-2023	Bilgilioglu, Burhan Baha/0000-0001-6950-4336; MUSAOGLU, NEBIYE/0000-0002-8022-8755; Erten, Esra/0000-0002-4208-7170														2072-4292				JUL	2021	13	14							2701	10.3390/rs13142701	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13142701													WOS:000677039500001

Unfortunately, the ecological status of the lake has changed dramatically, mainly due to the lowering of water table caused by groundwater abstractions for irrigation. It is a permanent small karstic lake whose surface has reduced in the last decades to nearly the third part of its historical water level. The water column shows a marked seasonal oxycline, that splits an aerobic upper layer (epilimnion) from an anaerobic layer below (hypolimnion). Sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons and applying chemical tools at epilimnion, hypolimnion and sediment, showed a clear gradient in the bacterial community structure, which support the co-existence of assimilatory and dissimilatory microbial mediated reactions. Results allows to infer that microbial stratification could provide various physical and chemical environments at different depths in the water column related to biogeochemical reactions providing N-S-C- recycling processes.					; Alvarez-Ortí, Manuel/K-1212-2014; Moreno, Jose Luis/L-7154-2014; MORENO, JOSE/L-7154-2014; Gomez-Alday, Juan Jose/K-2876-2014; Gómez Alday, Juan José/AGE-9522-2022; Sanz, David/K-5017-2014; Alvarez-Orti, Manuel/K-1212-2014; Fernández, José/AAK-7827-2020	Espin Montoro, Yolanda/0000-0002-2666-0432; Moreno, Jose Luis/0000-0001-6499-1120; Gomez-Alday, Juan Jose/0000-0003-1399-0421; Sanz, David/0000-0002-1629-2875; Alvarez-Orti, Manuel/0000-0002-5759-1580; 														2076-3417				JUL	2021	11	14							6309	10.3390/app11146309	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11146309													WOS:000675988100001

Predicting open-water thermal regimes of temperate North American lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Temperature profoundly affects the physical, chemical, and biological attributes of lakes and is influenced by several abiotic factors. Lake temperature modelling permits regional estimates of seasonal fish thermal habitat availability; however, this requires models that are accurate across large spatial scales. To address this, we fit a semi-mechanistic seasonal temperature-profile model (STM) to 369 morphometrically diverse North American lakes with data spanning 1971-2016. STM with a fixed-depth thermocline formula accurately modelled lake temperature (median pseudo-R-2: 0.95, median lake-year-specific root mean square error (RMSE): 1.13 degrees C). We used random forests to select candidate predictors, then used linear mixed-effects modelling, based on these predictors, to create empirical equations to predict STM parameters from lake-specific morphometric and climate measures. We tested the accuracy of our equations by predicting thermal profiles in 776 Ontario lakes, finding good agreement between predicted and observed temperatures (median lake-year-specific RMSE: 2.38 degrees C) and stratification occurrence (91.7%). These findings enhance our understanding of the factors that influence lake temperatures and can be used to identify lake types and regions that may be especially susceptible to climate change.

J	Huo, D; Bishop, MP; Young, B; Chi, ZH				Huo, Da; Bishop, Michael P.; Young, Brennan; Chi, Zhaohui			Modeling the feedbacks between surface ablation and morphological variations on debris-covered Baltoro Glacier in the central Karakoram	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Recent studies show that many debris-covered glaciers exhibit high-magnitude differential thinning despite the presence of supraglacial debris. Existing studies have not adequately explored the variability in surface ablation, morphology, and related feedback mechanisms that incorporate topographically controlled surface irradiance and debris transport. In this study, we address these issues using a radiation-driven surface ablation model that more fully characterizes ablation dynamics by accounting for temporally-linked radiative forcing, surface geomorphological evolution and gravitational debris flux. Simulation results based on Baltoro Glacier in the cen-tral Karakoram indicate the following: 1) A debris-covered glacier can exhibit high spatial variability in surface ablation due to heterogeneous debris thickness and debris transport. A bare-ice glacier given similar initial con-ditions, has higher overall ablation but exhibits much less variability. 2) The topographic influence on surface ablation is non-negligible because glacier-surface topography controls irradiance and gravitational debris flux. The overall ablation on a debris-covered glacier tends to increase in response to high-frequency topographic variations due to the larger area with thin debris cover. In contrast, a bare-ice glacier exhibits decreased overall ablation in response to high-frequency topographic variations due to its high sensitivity to topographic shading. 3) Gravity-driven surface debris flux plays an important role in local debris thickness redistribution, which regulates ablation rates over the ablation season. 4) Surface ablation dynamics on a debris-covered glacier is regulated by active system couplings and feedbacks between surface morphology, melt and debris transport. Consequently, certain locations on a debris-covered glacier may be more sensitive to radiative forcing than previously thought. Simulation results suggest that nonlinear feedback responses may permit debris-covered glacier subsystems to be very sensitive to radiative forcing, thereby causing significant morphological changes to the glacier surface.

Arid areas, with fragile hydrological systems, are very sensitive to changes in the weather, so the coupling analysis of short-term weather and runoff in arid areas is of great significance. The Daihai Lake is a closed inland lake in an arid area of China. In this paper, Weather Research and Forecasting model modeHydrological module (WRF-HYDRO) is used to simulate the coupling of weather and hydrology in the Daihai Lake Basin. Regional optimization of WRF-HYDRO is carried out to determine the optimal parameters. The optimal WRF-HYDRO model is applied to couple the short-term weather and runoff in the Daihai Lake Basin to reproduce several rainstorm and flood events. It is found that runoff infiltration parameter (REFKDT) in WRF-HYDRO is the parameter that has the most severe effect on runoff in the Daihai Lake Basin. WRF-HYDRO can capture the rainstorm moment of the rainstorm events in the Daihai Lake Basin, especially the first rainstorm moment, and its simulation accuracy is good. WRF-HYDRO has a strong ability to capture flood peak, but there is a discrepancy between WRF-HYDRO flood peak and Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) calculation result at the flood peak moment. The northern part of Zuoyun County should guard against the occurrence of flood disaster in wet season. The coupling of weather and hydrology can not only make up for the lack of runoff data in arid basins, but also provide a basis for water resources management and disaster prevention and mitigation in the basins.

J	Huang, YL; Kinouchi, T				Huang, Yilin; Kinouchi, Tsuyoshi			Revealing Decadal Glacial Changes and Lake Evolution in the Cordillera Real, Bolivia: A Semi-Automated Landsat Imagery Analysis	REMOTE SENSING												The impact of global climate change on glaciers has drawn significant attention; however, limited research has been conducted to comprehend the consequences of glacier melting on the associated formation and evolution of glacial lakes. This study presents a semi-automated methodology developed on the cloud platforms Google Earth Engine and Google Colab to effectively detect dynamic changes in the glaciers as well as glacial and non-glacial lakes of the Cordillera Real, Bolivia, using over 200 Landsat images from 1984 to 2021. We found that the study area experienced a rise in temperature and precipitation, resulting in a substantial decline in glacier coverage and a simultaneous increase in both the total number and total area of lakes. A strong correlation between glacier area and the extent of natural glacier-fed lakes highlights the significant downstream impact of glacier recession on water bodies. Over the study period, glaciers reduced their total area by 42%, with recent years showing a deceleration in glacier recession, aligning with the recent stabilization observed in the area of natural glacier-fed lakes. Despite these overall trends, many smaller lakes, especially non-glacier-fed ones, decreased in size, attributed to seasonal and inter-annual variations in lake inflow caused by climate variability. These findings suggest the potential decline of natural lakes amid ongoing climate changes, prompting alterations in natural landscapes and local water resources. The study reveals the response of glaciers and lakes to climate variations, including the contribution of human-constructed water reservoirs, providing valuable insights into crucial aspects of future water resources in the Cordillera Real.

We studied sexual differences in subterranean amphipods Niphargus living in shallow subterranean habitats (close to the surface), cave streams (intermediate), and cave lakes (deepest and most isolated). These three habitats differ because at greater depths there is lower food availability, reduced predation, and weaker seasonality. Additionally, species near the surface have a near-even adult sex ratio (ASR), whereas species from cave lakes have a female-biased ASR. We hypothesized (a) a decrease in sexual dimorphism from shallow subterranean habitats to cave lake species because of weaker sexual selection derived from changes in the ASR and (b) an increase in female body size in cave lakes because of stronger fecundity selection on account of oligotrophy, reduced predation, and weaker seasonality. We measured body size and two sexually dimorphic abdominal appendages for all 31 species and several behaviours related to male competition (activity, risk-taking, exploration) for 12 species. Species with an equal ASR that live close to the surface exhibited sexual dimorphism in all three morphological traits, but not in behaviour. The body size of females increased from the surface to cave lakes, but no such trend was observed in males. In cave lake species, males and females differed neither morphologically nor behaviourally. Our results are consistent with the possibility that sexual and fecundity selection covary across the three habitats, which indirectly and directly, respectively, shape the degree of sexual dimorphism in Niphargus species.

J	Liu, J; Fang, J; Li, HL; Cui, RH; Chen, M				Liu Jie; Fang Jian; Li Hong-Lei; Cui Rong-Hua; Chen Ming			Secular variation of gravity anomalies within the Tibetan Plateau derived from GRACE data	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION												The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have collected data more than 11 years. With these data as well as the improvement of data processing methods, we can analyze the secular trends of mass variations rather than just the large-scale seasonal variations. Using these data we can study the uplift process and its mechanism of the Tibetan Plateau. In this paper, 11 years of satellite gravity data of GRACE Release 05 models (Center for Space Research (CSR), GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)) from January 2003 to December 2013 were used to reveal the secular trends of gravity anomaly variation within the Tibetan Plateau by means of the least square method. A reduction of hydrological signals from the detected integral secular trends using global hydrological models (Global Land Data Assimilation System, GLDAS and Climate Prediction Center, CPC, averaged) is attempted. The glacier model result provided by Paulson is used to reduce the GIA (Glacial Isostatic Adjustment) effect. Also, we use the scaling factor method to weaken the GRACE post-process errors. At last we obtain the secular trends of gravity anomalies in China and adjacent areas. The results are largely similar to the previous research. Also, we find a remarkable increase signal of gravity in the Tibetan Plateau. Such a change cannot be attributed to the lake expanding and precipitation increase in the Tibetan Plateau. Instead it is possibly caused by the crustal thickening due to the subduction of Indian plate beneath the Eurasian plate. The continuing collision and compression between the India and Eurasia plates result in intense uplift and orogenic extension of the Tibetan Plateau. We built a forward model with 3D rectangular prisms according to the GPS results and Airy isostatic hypothesis. Using the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone as the boundary, the plateau was divided into southern and northern parts. The modeling results show the gravity anomalies are increasing at a rate of 0. 2 mu Gal . a(-1) in the north, which is a little less than the result from GRACE solution 0. 3 +/- 0.08 mu Gal . a(-1) (corresponding to a crustal thickening rate of 3 mm . a(-1)). The rest unexplained part is possibly related to lakes, glacier, permafrost and others. Meanwhile, our results show the southern part has a rate of -0. 62 +/- 0. 06 mu Gal . a(-1), which is presumably the combined influence of tectonics and groundwater and so on. It is a challenging to explain the positive signal in the Tibetan Plateau clearly with current knowledge. The new GRACE Follow-On satellites may provide us more means and evidence. With the continuing accumulation of observations, we can combine a variety of modern geodetic techniques (GRACE, GPS, absolute gravity, remote sensing, and so on) to study the geodynamics of the Tibetan Plateau more accurately.

Water samples were collected in 2002 and 2003 during the growing season from the submerged vegetation zone (Ceratophyllum demersum L.) and comparatively from the emergent vegetation zone (Typha angustifolia L.) and the pelagic zone. Phytoplankton was dominated by Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanoprokaryota. In comparison with other zones, the highest values of abundance and biomass of Chlorophyta were recorded in the submerged vegetation zone. Additionally, Ceratophyllum demersum was found to inhibit diatom development, which is probably connected with the secretion of allelopathic substances by this plant. The aim of the current study was to analyze the influence of Ceratophyllum demersum L. on the structure of phytoplankton in a shallow, eutrophic lake.

In this study, we examine the differences in fire regime and evaluate possible sources of its variation between the surrounding mainland and the islands of Lake Duparquet (44.5 km(2)), a typical boreal lake in north-western Quebec, Canada. Dendrochronological reconstructions suggest that fires were frequent and of variable intensity on the islands, whereas fires were less frequent on the adjacent mainland, but were usually large and intense. Islands were significantly drier and warmer than the mainland, and maximum values of Fire Weather Index were significantly higher on the islands during both the early part of the fire season (May-June) and the whole fire season (May-September). The lightning density within the lake perimeter was significantly higher than in the surrounding mainland (0.63 v. 0.48 year(-1) km(-2) respectively). This pattern was a result of the differences in lightning density during the first half of the lightning season. The study suggests that more fire-prone local weather and higher frequency of lightning strikes could cause a higher frequency of low-intensity fires on the islands, compared with the mainland.

The thickness and horizontal continuity of layers within seasonal snowpacks can be highly variable, due to snow blowing around topography and vegetation, and this has important implications for hydrology, remote sensing and avalanche forecasting. In this paper, we present practical field and post-processing protocols for recording lateral variations in snow stratigraphy using near-infrared (NIR) photography. A Fuji S9100 digital camera, modified lobe sensitive to NIR wavelengths, was mounted on a rail system that allowed for rapid imaging of a 10 m long snow trench excavated on the north side of Toolik Lake, Alaska (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W). Post-processing of the images included removal of lens distortion and vignetting. A tape measure running along the base of the trench provided known locations (control points) that permitted scaling and georeferencing. Snow layer heights estimated from the NIR images compared well with manual stratigraphic measurements made at 0.2 m intervals along the trench (n = 357, R(2) = 0.97). Considerably greater stratigraphic detail was captured by the NIR images than in the manually recorded profiles. NIR imaging of snow trenches using the described protocols is an efficient tool for quantifying continuous microscale variations in snow layers and associated properties.

The zooplankton of four saline shallow lakes of the province of La Pampa was studied on a monthly basis during a 2-year period to determine its temporal and spatial variation. The surface of these shallow lakes (< 2.5 m depth) varied between 56.8 and 215.9 ha, and some have from 8.4 to 20.8 g (.) l(-1). The more saline lakes have '' clear '' water and the less saline lakes '' turbid '' water. Fishes, Jenynsia multidentata, were present in only two lakes during the last two months of the studied period. The zooplankton was composed of 17 taxa of Rotifera, 5 taxa of Cladocera and 4 taxa of Copepoda. The low diversity and the faunistic composition are characteristic of saline environments. Although the studied lakes share 38% of the species, the faunistic similarity was higher between the two least saline lakes. The lowest diversity was found in the two most saline lakes. All four shallow lakes were characterized by their very high zooplankton density, especially in the least saline lakes (< 80000 ind (.) l(-1)). The abundance is significantly correlated with the water transparency but not with salinity. The zooplankton temporal variation was characterized by the alternation of macro- and microzooplankton, probably regulated by competition and intrazooplanktonic predation. In each lake, the spatial abundance distribution of the macro- and microzooplankton was homogeneous. It was related to the shallow depht of the lakes and their polymictic condition. The SCHEFFER model on alternative states in shallow lakes acknowledges that it cannot be applied to saline lakes because Daphnia, the main responsible for the clear water state, is not tolerant to high salinity. Our study shows that the most saline lakes, where the halophylic Daphnia menucoensis is abundant, have also the most clear waters. Another difference that we found with regards to the mentioned model is that, in turbid lakes, it could not have had a top-down control on macrozooplankton exerted by fishes because in these takes fishes were practically absent.

Observations spanned the years 1853 - 2001. Available data included dates of ice formation and ice break up as well as the number of ice free days in a year. A high degree of temporal coherence in ice phenology between lakes was observed (137/365 pairwise correlations significant at P < 0.05). Significant monotonic trends towards earlier break up dates and longer ice free seasons were observed across the region both in the entire series and in the last thirty years of data. Trends in longer series may be associated with the end of the Little Ice Age. The significantly longer ice free seasons and earlier ice break up dates observed in the study area have important implications for lakes in other parts of Canada where climate change effects are predicted to be more extreme than in South-Central Ontario.

J	Brown-Peterson, NJ; Heins, DC				Brown-Peterson, N. J.; Heins, D. C.			Interspawning interval of wild female three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus in Alaska	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The interspawning interval, or spawning frequency, of wild three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, was estimated using histological examination of postovulatory follicles (POF). Females in Alaskan lakes appeared to have as much as a 48 h delay between ovulation and ovoposition, yet the POF method could still be used to estimate the interspawning interval. In two Alaskan lakes the interspawning interval was estimated to range from 2.2 to 7.8 days among individual female G. aculeatus. These estimates were consistent with the range (2.5 to 5 days) of previous estimates among individual females from laboratory observations of spawning G. aculeatus, as well as anecdotal accounts of spawning intervals reported from wild populations in Canada (5-10 days). The interspawning interval of females increased during the course of the spawning season in Alaska, showing that the majority of female spawning activity occurred during the earliest portion of the approximate 6-week reproductive season. The increased interspawning interval appears to be related to a previously reported decrease in body condition in reproductive females during the breeding season. Thus, female G. aculeatus may be unable to sustain the initial rate of reproduction as energy stores that support the rapid growth of vitellogenic oocytes are depleted.

Evaluation of biological stability and corrosion potential in drinking water distribution systems: a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The appearance of assimilable organic carbon (AOC), microbial regrowth, disinfection by-products (DBPs), and pipe corrosion in drinking water distribution systems are among those major safe drinking water issues in many countries. The water distribution system of Cheng-Ching Lake Water Treatment Plant (CCLWTP) was selected in this study to evaluate the: (1) fate and transport of AOC, DBPs [e.g., trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs)], and other organic carbon indicators in the selected distribution system, (2) correlations between AOC (or DBPs) and major water quality parameters [e.g. dissolved oxygen (DO), free residual chlorine, and bacteria, and (3) causes and significance of corrosion problems of the water pipes in this system. In this study, seasonal water samples were collected from 13 representative locations in the distribution system for analyses of AOC, DBPs, and other water quality indicators. Results indicate that residual free chlorine concentrations in the distribution system met the drinking water standards (0.2 to 1 mg l(-1)) established by Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). Results show that AOC measurements correlated positively with total organic carbon (TOC) and UV-254 (an organic indicator) values in this system. Moreover, AOC concentrations at some locations were higher than the 50 mu g acetate-C l(-1) standard established by Taiwan Water Company. This indicates that the microbial regrowth might be a potential water quality problem in this system. Higher DO measurements (> 5.7 mg l(-1)) might cause the aerobic biodegradation of THMs and HAAs in the system, and thus, low THMs (< 0.035 mg l(-1)) and HAAs (< 0.019 mg l(-1)) concentrations were observed at all sampling locations. Results from the observed negative Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) values, higher Ryznar Stability Index (RSI) values, and high Fe(3+)concentrations at some pipe-end locations indicate that highly oxidative and corrosive conditions occurred. This reveals that pipe replacement should be considered at these locations. These findings would be helpful in managing the water distribution system for maintaining a safe drinking water quality.

Placing and predicting the position of this boundary in nearshore lacustrine deposits of the Triassic Yanchang Formation (Ordos Basin, China) is of considerable applied significance, since sandstone deposits of this succession host numerous geological resources; yet, delta-top and delta-front deposits differ fundamentally in terms of sandstone fraction, sandbody geometries, and petrophysical properties. However, established sedimentological criteria for shoreline identification relevant to marine environments are only partially applicable to this lacustrine setting. For example, in lacustrine systems, (i) water salinity can be considerably lower, (ii) tidal processes are negligible, (iii) wave activity is often limited and of local significance (e.g., distal and lateral deltafront fringes; transgressive periods of delta-lobe reworking), (iv) seasonal fluctuations in water chemistry and biogenic productivity may be common, and (v) the rate, frequency and magnitude of oscillations in base level differ from marine counterparts. Collectively, these factors hinder the differentiation of delta-plain and deltafront deposits in the Yanchang Formation. The establishment of effective criteria with which to make such distinction is important for palaeogeographic restorations, and for resource exploration and exploitation. On the basis of detailed sedimentological descriptions of well cores and outcrop exposures of the Yanchang Formation in the southeastern Ordos Basin, sedimentary facies accumulated as part of different sub-environments and facies belts are studied. Delta-plain deposits can be readily differentiated from those of delta-front origin on the basis of criteria relating to sediment texture, sedimentary structures, palaeontological content, well-log profiles, and vertical facies successions. These criteria are summarized and applied to better characterize the deltaic setting and to reconstruct the evolution of lacustrine shorelines during accumulation of the Yanchang Formation, particularly for the northeastern area of the basin. A key outcome of this study is the development of a broadly applicable model for the recognition of sub-environments in river-dominated lacustrine deltaic successions. A generalized workflow is established to demonstrate how techniques in sedimentary facies analysis can be employed to reconstruct siliciclastic lacustrine delta shorelines, and thereby predict reservoir characteristics.

Shesha; Sajhunneesa, T.; George, Grinson			Seasonality in carbon chemistry of Cochin backwaters	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Seasonality in carbon chemistry of Cochin backwaters, Southern India, was investigated between 2018 and 2019. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) showed strong seasonal variations. Lowest DIC was observed during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM), in conjunction with low salinity in surface waters, suggesting strong freshwater influence. The maximum concentration of partial pressure of carbon dioxide in water (pCO(2)w) was recorded from polluted waters of Vembanad Lake (similar to 16,000 mu atm). Excluding the SWM, the inner most stations (freshwater) showed lower pCO(2)w levels compared with the outermost (estuarine) ones. With regard to sampling stations, all the environmental properties, except silicate and phosphate, exhibited significant variation, pointing to large spatial heterogeneity across the stations. Salinity showed a strong correlation with dissolved inorganic carbon within the Cochin backwaters. High pH and low pCO(2)w observed in some of the inner most stations indicates role of pH in carbonate speciation. Our study indicates large seasonal fluctuation in biogeochemical parameters and strong heterogeneity between individual stations which therefore necessitates development of local biogeochemical models for better understanding of carbon budget in these waters.

In this respect, the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band-based atmospheric correction approach has proven advantageous when applied to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite. However, even so, uncertainties affect its accuracy. We performed a regional vicarious calibration of the MODIS-Aqua SWIR (1240, 2130)-based atmospheric correction using in situ water surface reflectance data measured during different seasons in Lake Taihu, a highly turbid lake. We then verified the accuracy of the (1240, 2130)-based atmospheric correction approach using these results; good results were obtained for the remote sensing reflectance retrievals at the 555, 645, and 859 nm, with average relative errors of 15%, 14%, and 22%, respectively, and no significant bias. Comparisons with the (1240, 2130)-based iterative approach and (1640, 2130)-based approach showed that the vicarious calibrated (1240, 2130)-based approach has the best accuracy and robustness. Thus, it is applicable to the highly turbid Lake Taihu. It may also be applicable to other highly turbid inland waters with similar optical and aerosol optical properties above water, but such applications will require further validation.

Temperature-dependent demographic differences in sessile rotifers of the genus Limnias (Rotifera: Gnesiotrocha)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim : Rotifer research on sessile taxa has received less attention because they are not easy to identify in fixed samples. In the Lake Xochimilco, a Ramsar site in Mexico City, three morphotypes of L. ceratophylli and a single morphotype of L. cf. melicerta occur in different densities. The aim of this study was to test if temperature was responsible for the differences in the population densities of these morphotypes. Methodology : The presentstudy was carried out using population growth method consisting of 4 treatments (3 morphotypes of L. ceratophylli and one of L. cf. melicerta) at 20 and 25 degrees C. Experiments were carried out in 50 ml glass jars containing 25 ml synthetic medium with Chlorella vulgar's as food. The population growth rates (r) were derived. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc tests were used to quantify the intro -and interspecific differences in the population growth rates. Results : The temperature levels for optimal population growth rates differed among the morphotypes of same species. At 20 degrees C, the morphotype 1 had the highest r (0.23 d(-1)) similar to that of L. cf. melicerta, while morphotype 3 had the lowest (0.15 d(-1)). For L. cf. melicerta, the r was higher at 25 C than at 20 degrees C. Of three morphotypes of L. ceratophylli, morphotype 3 had the highest rat 25 degrees C similar to that of L. cf. melicerta at same temperature. Interpretation : There were significant differences among growth patterns within the morphotypes of L. ceratophylli, depending on culture temperature. These trends highlight the relative importance of environmental variables in differentiating morphotypes of a sessile species complex which could explain their possible seasonal. changes in the natural waterbodies.

The extant literature reports varying effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on the vertical distribution and diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton, with some but not all taxa reported to avoid hypoxic waters. We studied the vertical distribution and DVM of diverse zooplankton taxa throughout three seasons over 2 years (2014 and 2015) in Lacamas Lake, WA, USA. We observed hypoxia (<2 mg L-1 dissolved oxygen) in the hypolimnion of Lacamas Lake during five of six sampling periods, with zooplankton populations often exhibiting 'h-metric' values (defined as the proportion of a zooplankton population residing within hypoxic waters) ranged from 0.14 to 1.00, with an overall mean of h=0.66. Moreover, we observed a lack of DVM in most zooplankton taxa on most occasions. Our findings indicate both community-level and taxon-specific zooplankton tolerances to hypoxia, although the exact mechanisms at play remain to be fully elucidated. Nevertheless, the common residency in hypoxic waters and the lack of DVM by diverse zooplankton taxa that we observed likely have implications for food web dynamics in Lacamas Lake and other water bodies.

J	Schick, S; Rössler, O; Weingartner, R				Schick, Simon; Rossler, Ole; Weingartner, Rolf			An Evaluation of Model Output Statistics for Subseasonal Streamflow Forecasting in European Catchments	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Subseasonal and seasonal forecasts of the atmosphere, oceans, sea ice, or land surfaces often rely on Earth system model (ESM) simulations. While the most recent generation of ESMs simulates runoff per land surface grid cell operationally, it does not typically simulate river streamflow directly. Here, we apply the model output statistics (MOS) method to the hindcast archive of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Linear models are tested that regress observed river streamflow on surface runoff, subsurface runoff, total runoff, precipitation, and surface air temperature simulated by ECMWF's forecast systems S4 and SEAS5. In addition, the pool of candidate predictors contains observed precipitation and surface air temperature preceding the date of prediction. The experiment is conducted for 16 European catchments in the period 1981-2006 and focuses on monthly average streamflow at lead times of 0 and 20 days. The results show that skill against the streamflow climatology is frequently absent and varies considerably between predictor combinations, catchments, and seasons. Using streamflow persistence as a benchmark model further deteriorates skill. This is most pronounced for a catchment that features lakes, which extend to about 14% of the catchment area. On average, however, the predictor combinations using the ESM runoff simulations tend to perform best.					; Rössler, Ole/C-7488-2009	Schick, Simon/0000-0002-1456-2894; 													1525-755X	1525-7541				JUL	2019	20	7					1399	1416		10.1175/JHM-D-18-0195.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0195.1													WOS:000475344400001

Lakes in mountainous regions are generally small, and therefore more sensitive to natural/human-induced perturbations. In this study, the effect of twentieth century global climate change and human interventions was analysed for Lake Nainital, located in a densely populated valley of Kumaun Himalaya. For this purpose, gridded (0.5(0) x 0.5(0) and 0.25(0) x 0.25(0)) climatic (T-Mean, T-Max, T-Min, DTR and rainfall) data of period 1901-2000 available on monthly time steps were employed for detecting an annual and seasonal pattern of change in the climatic variables in the lake region. The samples of water collected between February 1994 and July 1996 for different months from the lake were used for determining the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake water. The samples were analysed for: field parameters (temperature, pH, EC), major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, SO42- and Cl-), and nutrients (NO3- and PO4-). Results derived from the chemical analysis of water reveal that anthropogenic activities, increased in recent past, have accelerated the deterioration and eutrophication processes of the lake. However, decrease in mean annual and monsoonal rainfall will affect the various components of water balance and may cause reduction in the lake volume in the future.					rai, shive/AFP-5680-2022; Kumar, Sudhir/ABE-6793-2020; Singh, Dharmaveer/E-3980-2019	Singh, Dharmaveer/0000-0002-0017-2764													1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2016	75	20							1380	10.1007/s12665-016-6177-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6177-1													WOS:000386578200043

The insurance hypothesis suggests that biodiversity could improve community productivity and reduce the temporal variability of main ecosystem processes. In the present study, we used a plankton community that was investigated from 2011 to 2014 in Lake Nansihu to test this hypothesis and explore the mechanisms involved. As a result, 138 phytoplankton and 76 zooplankton species were identified in the lake, and their biomasses showed apparent seasonal variations. The average temporal stability index of zooplankton taxa was significantly higher than that of phytoplankton. Complex relationships were observed between the species richness and temporal stability of different phytoplankton taxa: a unimodal relationship for both Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta; a strong concave relationship for Euglenophyta; and no apparent relationship for both Chlorophyta and total phytoplankton. These relationships were primarily controlled by the portfolio effect; while the effects of overyielding and species asynchrony were relatively weak. Phytoplankton species richness had a significant positive influence on the temporal stability indices of protozoa, Rotifera and total zooplankton, while its influence on Cladocera and copepods was not significant. The dominant mechanisms were found to be 'trophic overyielding' and a weak 'trophic portfolio effect'; however, 'trophic species asynchrony' played a minor role. These results demonstrated that the effects of diversity on community stability can be complex in natural ecosystems. In addition, the diversity of phytoplankton not only influenced its own temporal stability, but also affected the stability of zooplankton through trophic interactions.					; Zhao, Lei/F-4258-2018	Tian, Wang/0009-0006-2741-140X; Zhao, Lei/0000-0003-1643-4981; Zhang, Huayong/0000-0001-8898-8567														2073-4441				OCT	2016	8	10							454	10.3390/w8100454	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8100454													WOS:000389659200039

However, only a few studies have examined their taxonomic and ecological characteristics. We identified and enumerated diatom assemblages from sediment, rock, and moss habitats in 34 ultra-oligotrophic and highly transparent lakes and ponds on Victoria Island, Arctic Canada. The similar limnological characteristics of the sites allowed us to examine the influence of habitat, independent of water chemistry, on the diatom assemblages. As is typical in shallow arctic water bodies, benthic taxa, including species of Achnanthes , Caloneis , Cymbella , Navicula , and Nitzschia , were most widely represented. Minor gradients in our measured environmental variables did not significantly explain any variance in diatom species, but there were marked differences in diatom assemblages among sites. Pond ephemerality seems to explain some diatom variation, because aerophilic taxa such as Achnanthes kryophila Petersen and A. marginulata Grunow were dominant in shallow sites that had undergone appreciable reductions in volume. We identified several taxa that exhibited strong habitat preferences to sediment, moss, or rock substrates and also found significant differences (P<0.01) in diatom composition among the three habitats. In comparisons with three similar diatom surveys extending over 1200 km of latitude, we determined that surface sediment assemblages differed significantly (P<0.001) among all regions examined. Diatom species diversity was inversely related to latitude, a result likely explained by differences in the lengths of growing seasons. These data contribute important ecological information on diatom assemblages in arctic regions and will aid in the interpretation of environmental changes in biomonitoring and paleolimnological studies.

Measurements of total HD and mercury speciation (MMHg and dissolved gaseous Hg (DGHg)) have been made in the surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay system, including sampling transects into Baltimore Harbor, a region where sediment Hg concentrations can exceed 5 nmol g(-1) and sediment MMHg concentrations approach 50 pmol g(-1). Surface water Hg concentrations are typical of an impacted urban estuary that has a high suspended sediment load (SPM; typically > 5 mg l(-1)), and for the upper Bay, where total Hg is generally 20 pM or less, particulate Hg is the dominant fraction, Total Hg concentrations tend to decrease down-estuary, and this is also true for the sub-estuaries (Potomac and Patuxent Rivers). This decrease coincides with a decrease in SPM, but urban inputs are also higher up-estuary. Measurement of total Hg and MMHg in the anoxic bottom waters that develop seasonally in the harbor demonstrate the increased concentration of Hg, and especially MMHg, under low oxygen conditions, and the most likely source is the release of these species from sediments. Both intensive studies and long-term measurements show that the concentration of DGHg is relatively low in this system (typically < 0.2 phl) and DGHg is a small fraction of the total Hg. Based on the information available, a preliminary mass balance budget is constructed for the Chesapeake Bay, Direct atmospheric deposition contributes a substantial portion of the Hg to the Bay while sedimentary removal is the principal sink. Overall, 29% of the riverine and atmospheric inputs to the Bay is exported to the coastal ocean. Thus, the Bay is an efficient trap for Hg. The Bay is, however, a net source of MMHg suggesting that significant methylation of Hg occurs within the estuary. On a watershed scale, only about 5% of the total atmospheric deposition to the watershed is exported to the coastal ocean. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

An Application in the Lake Tana Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment loading in water bodies is crucial for effective water quality management. Remote sensing (RS) has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for monitoring turbidity, which can provide insights into sediment dynamics in water bodies. In this study, we investigate the potential of turbidity data derived from RS to explain simulated spatial and temporal sediment loading patterns in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. Utilizing existing RS lake turbidity data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and simulated seasonal and multiyear trends of river sediment loadings into Lake Tana from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT + model), we estimate correlations at different river inlets into Lake Tana. The results reveal a strong positive correlation (R-2 > 0.66) between the multiyear monthly average sediment load from inflow rivers and RS lake turbidity at most river inlets. This indicates that the simulated river sediment loads and lake turbidity at river inlets exhibit similar seasonal patterns. Notably, higher turbidity levels are observed at the river inlet with the highest sediment load export. These findings highlight the potential of RS turbidity products in characterizing temporal and spatial patterns of sediment loadings, particularly in data-scarce regions, contributing to a better understanding of water quality dynamics in such areas.					; van Griensven, Ann/M-4312-2013	Nkwasa, Albert/0000-0002-8685-8854; Tang, Ting/0000-0002-2867-9241; Baltodano Martinez, Analy/0000-0002-2067-8025; Lekarkar, Katoria/0000-0003-4527-5422; van Griensven, Ann/0000-0002-2105-6287; Yimer, Estifanos Addisu/0000-0001-8411-9006													1420-2026	1573-2967				OCT	2024	29	5					871	882		10.1007/s10666-024-09972-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-024-09972-y		MAR 2024											WOS:001190493700001

At Yunlong Lake, an alpine lake in Southwest China, we studied the seasonal succession of diatom assemblages to produce a mean surface water temperature (MSWT) transfer function. In addition, based on the spatial distribution of surface diatom assemblages with water depth, we produced a diatom-water depth (WD) transfer function. Combined with the analysis of diatom assemblages in a sediment core (YL2013-A), changes in surface water temperature and water level over the last similar to 100 years were quantitatively reconstructed using the diatom-based transfer functions. Comparison with records of regional meteorology and reservoir water capacity revealed that the diatom-based lake water level reconstruction is a sensitive indicator of short-term fluctuations in precipitation, and it also reflects a long-term stepwise rise in water level caused by the impounding and large-scale extension of the reservoir. In addition, the diatom-inferred MSWT is consistent with the changes in air temperature prior to large-scale human disturbance of the site. However, after the extension of the reservoir, although the regional air temperature continued to increase, the water temperature decreased substantially. This suggests that the large increase in lake water volume in the short term led to a decrease in the average water temperature, which in turn led to the occurrence of a diatom bloom in the cold season. The results demonstrate that diatom transfer functions based on modern observations of the same lake has a high environmental sensitivity and can be used for the quantitative reconstruction of regional climate change. Overall, our findings provide a foundation for the use of lake diatom records for quantitative paleoclimatic reconstruction on various timescales.

Shifting baselines and cross-scale drivers of lake water clarity: Applications for lake assessment	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Temporal Secchi depth trends are used in lake assessment to evaluate lake condition and possible shifts in trophic state. For accurate lake assessments, it is important to differentiate regional trends from lake-specific trends, but this can be confounded by interacting factors. We present a divergent trend analysis which uses temporal patterns of Secchi depth water clarity from 1999 to 2018 for five different types of reference lakes from minimally disturbed watersheds to create dynamic baselines against which we evaluate Secchi depth trends from nonreference lakes in Maine, USA. We used mixed-effect generalized additive models to generate smoothed curves of the expected baseline Secchi depth for each reference lake type to account for the nonlinear dynamics of lake condition through time. The majority of nonreference lakes (74%) showed no difference between measured trend (actual Secchi depth data) and divergent trend (residual Secchi depth from baseline trends). The most common difference in lakes with inconsistent trend test results showed stability in measured trends but apparent declining trends in divergent Secchi depth clarity. We used a Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) model to help interpret the variation and shifts observed in baseline reference lake trends. The best DFA model identified two common trends in water clarity among lake types and precipitation during the primary stratification season as the most informative covariable. Because precipitation amount and intensity are expected to increase according to predictive climate models for the Northeast US, our results suggest that baseline lake clarity in Maine will decrease with climate change.

Microtephra horizons originating from Icelandic eruptions were recorded in two ca. 2 m thick peat profiles at Klocka Bog in west-central Sweden. Five of the microtephra horizons were geochemically correlated to the Askja-1875, Hekla-3, Kebister, Hekla-4 and Lairg A tephras respectively. Radiocarbon-based dating of these tephras broadly agree with previously published ages from Iceland, Sweden, Germany and the British Isles. The identification of the Lairg A tephra demonstrates a more widespread distribution than previously thought, extending the usefulness of Icelandic Holocene tephrochronology further north into west-central Scandinavia. Long-lasting snow cover and seasonal wind distribution in the lower stratosphere are suggested as factors that may be responsible for fragmentary tephra deposition patterns in peat deposits of subarctic Scandinavia.

However, few studies have attempted to disentangle the relative biotic and abiotic drivers of intraspecific variation in seedling performance. In this study, we carried out a seedling transplant experiment with a factorial experimental design on three land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China, using four common native woody plant species. At different distances from the forest edge (2, 8, 32, 128 m), we transplanted four seedlings of each species into each of three cages: full-cage, for herbivore exclusion; half-cage, that allowed herbivore access but controlled for caging artifacts; and no-cage control. In the 576 cages, we recorded branch architecture, leaf traits, and seedling survival for each seedling before and after the experimental treatment. Overall, after one full growing season, edge-induced abiotic drivers and varied herbivory pressure led to intraspecific variation in seedling performance, including trade-offs in seedling architecture and resource-use strategies. However, responses varied across species with different life-history strategies and depended on the driver in question, such that the abiotic and biotic effects were additive across species, rather than interactive. Edge-induced abiotic variation modified seedling architecture of a shade-tolerant species, leading to more vertical rather than lateral growth at edges. Meanwhile, increased herbivory pressure resulted in a shift toward lower dry matter investment in leaves of a light-demanding species. Our results suggest that edge effects can drive rapid directional shifts in the performance and intraspecific traits of some woody plants from early ontogenetic stages, but most species in this study showed negligible phenotypic responses to edge effects. Moreover, species-specific responses suggest the importance of interspecific differences modulating the degree of trait plasticity, implying the need to incorporate individual-level responses when understanding the impact of forest fragmentation on plant communities.

Bioclimatic influence on water chemistry and dissolved organic matter in shallow temperate lakes of Andean Patagonia: A gradient approach	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We addressed the influence of bioclimatic variables (precipitation, temperature and vegetation) on physicochemical properties, carbon (C) and nutrients dynamics in shallow temperate lakes in the northern Patagonian Andes. Four shallow lakes (mean depth < 15 m) located along the Andean Patagonian bioclimatic gradient, and characterised by a west-to-east decrease in precipitation, increase in temperature and changes in vegetation type, were studied during wet and dry periods. Physicochemical variables, total nitrogen and phosphorus (TN and TP) and particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) were analysed. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of environmental variables on lake water chemistry and to identify the main factors associated with spatial and temporal differences in lake DOM pools. Spatial and seasonal decreases in precipitation and warming were reflected in reduced hydrological connectivity of the lakes. The reduced connectivity resulted in increased conductivity, pH, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and TN concentrations. Such conditions favoured the loss of lake DOM aromaticity, humic content and molecular weight/size, and increased the degradation signals and the biologically produced DOM fraction. Lakes responded uniformly to changes in climate variables along the Andean Patagonian gradient. Differences among lakes in water chemistry and DOM composition, were associated at the gradient scale with variation in precipitation, temperature and catchment vegetation, which may provide insights into C and water chemistry trajectories under forecasted climate trends. Our results suggest that drought and warming trends could result in less hydrological connectivity, shrinking terrestrial DOM fluxes to lakes while concomitantly increasing internal degradation processes.

J	Young, KL; Abnizova, A				Young, Kathy L.; Abnizova, Anna			Hydrologic Thresholds of Ponds in a Polar Desert Wetland Environment, Somerset Island, Nunavut, Canada	WETLANDS												Evaluation of the water storage in several ponds near Creswell Bay, Somerset Island, Canada, an area experiencing a polar desert climate (cool, moist), served to reveal factors that are important in the sustainability of these freshwater ecosystems within a larger wetland complex. Our study focused on the hydrology of 12 ponds of different sizes in various geomorphologic settings: moraine, bedrock, and coastal areas. A positive water balance plays an important role in the survival of the ponds experiencing variable climatic conditions and survival over the season depends largely on the local enrichment of water through various hydrologic linkages. Pond inputs and losses are governed by the pond catchment topography, substrate, hydrology, and seasonal climatic conditions. Low hydrologic energy and long hydroperiod (e.g., ponds in surface-flow dominated systems with multiple hydrologic linkages) are associated with a high degree of pond sustainability. Ponds with high hydrologic energy and short hydroperiods (e.g., ponds in precipitation and groundwater-dominated systems) show limited hydrologic sustainability. We suggest that these latter ponds in this polar desert environment will be the most vulnerable to future climate warming in the Canadian High Arctic.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2011	31	3					535	549		10.1007/s13157-011-0172-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-011-0172-9													WOS:000290681200009

Freshwater gastropods are grazers and likely to ingest toxic cyanobacteria, particularly Planktothrix agardhii, one of the most common species in the northern hemisphere. The study examines (i) the ingestion of toxic P. agardhii by the prosobranch Potamopyrgus antipodarum, (ii) the kinetics of MC accumulation and depuration in snail tissues during and post-exposure, and (iii) the impact of MCs on their life traits (survival, growth and fecundity). We showed that P. antipodarum ingested 71% of cyanobacteria available during the first 24 h in the presence or not of non-toxic food, and accumulated 1.3% of ingested MCs during the 5-week intoxication period. Elimination of MCs was total after 3 weeks of depuration. A decrease of growth and fecundity was observed during the intoxication period, but it was reversible after the end of exposure. Results are discussed in terms of variation of the response between prosobranch and pulmonate gastropods to toxic cyanobacteria exposure, and the negative impact of toxic cyanobacteria on natural communities of freshwater gastropods.

Large parts of talus cones were undercut by fluvial erosion and act as additional sediment sources for fluvial sediment transport, demonstrating the geomorphic coupling between individual subsystems of a sediment cascade. Using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), high resolution budgeting of sediment input from a talus cone was possible in the post-event field season. Further investigations of changes in the main sediment sources and direct measurements of bed load transport in the river enabled the authors to calculate a preliminary sediment balance. Total bed load flux leaving the catchment in the first post-event field season (year 2006) was c.7900 tons (one-third of the mass exported by the dambreak flood). The input from the main sediment sources was c.5061 t. Hence, the sediment balance has become negative; more sediment was exported from the catchment than stored within.

Annual variations in microcystin occurrence in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, based on high-throughput DNA sequencing, qPCR, and environmental parameters	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Eldridge SLC, Wood TM. 2019. Annual variation in microcystin occurrence in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, based on high-throughput DNA sequencing, qPCR, and environmental parameters. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Cyanobacteria-dominated blooms in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, create poor water quality and produce microcystins that may be detrimental to local wildlife and human health. Genetic tools, including high-throughput DNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), have been shown to improve the identification and quantification of key groups associated with these blooms over more traditional techniques. We examined the seasonal and interannual variations in nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations between 2013 and 2014 to describe the relations between these factors and the growth dynamics of Aphanizomenon and toxigenic Microcystis as described by DNA sequencing and qPCR. Although total nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations were similar between years, qPCR results showed the cyanobacterial populations to be 40 times larger in 2014 and indicated a large shift from an Aphanizomenon-dominant, low microcystin-level regime in 2013 to one dominated later in the season by microcystin-producing Microcystis in 2014. In both years, the transition from Aphanizomenon to Microcystis was coincident with a late-season increase in nitrite-plus-nitrate concentrations and in dissolved inorganic nitrogen to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIN:DIP) ratios. However, these increases did not explain the large interannual differences in total cyanobacteria abundance. Rather, we hypothesized that year-to-year differences in bioavailable phosphorus, which also manifested as lower total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN:TP) ratios, were responsible.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2020	36	1					31	44		10.1080/10402381.2019.1619112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1619112		JUN 2019											WOS:000475258400001

Water and phytoplankton samples were collected on March (dry season) and August (rainy season), and physical-chemical properties of water, phytoplankton biomass and community structure were determined. The results indicated that the banana cultivation resulted in increases in sediment, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations at estuaries of Lancang-Mekong River branches. Cultivation decreased phytoplankton diversity, abundance and biomass, as well as changed the phytoplankton community structure at estuaries of branches. Sediment concentration (increased by cultivation) was considered as the dominant influence factor of phytoplankton biomass and community structure. However, at downstream sites (primary channel), banana cultivation did not cause (result from its huge flow) the significant changes in physical-chemical properties of water, phytoplankton biomass or community structure.

Field evaluation of selected NERICA rice cultivars in Western Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Food shortage is a major problem in sub-Saharan Africa as population increases. NERICA (New Rice for Africa), the high yielding rice cultivars with short growth cycle were developed to solve the food crisis. The progeny has shown high potential to revolutionize rice farming, producing high yield with minimum inputs in stress-afflicted ecologies. However, information on their performance in Kenya has not been documented. A study was conducted in a field located at Alupe farm of Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA), in Western Kenya for a period of three years (2005-2007). Four NERICA rice cultivars (NERICA 1, NERICA 4, NERICA 10, and NERICA 11) and a local landrace "Dourado precoce" were planted in a completely randomized block design. Result showed that NERICA 10 attained physiological maturity most quickly [97 days after seeding (DAS)] followed by NERICA 1 (102 DAS). Dourado precoce took a much longer time to mature (116 DAS) than the other cultivars. On grain yield, NERICA 1 (4.1 ton ha(-1)) produced the highest while Dourado precoce (2.5 ton ha(-1)) gave the least in 2006. NERICA 10 (2.7 ton ha(-1)) however, produced the lowest grain yield in the same period among the NERICAs. NERICA 1, the most outstanding cultivar gave the highest yield (4.3 ton ha(-1)) in 2005 and yielded more than 4.0 ton ha(-1) in the other seasons.																			1991-637X					JAN 4	2011	6	1					60	66																WOS:000287927200008
J	Brown, PM; Kaufmann, MR; Shepperd, WD				Brown, PM; Kaufmann, MR; Shepperd, WD			Long-term, landscape patterns of past fire events in a montane ponderosa pine forest of central Colorado	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Parameters of fire regimes, including fire frequency, spatial extent of burned areas, fire severity, and season of fire occurrence, influence vegetation patterns over multiple scales. In this study, centuries-long patterns of fire events in a montane ponderosa pine - Douglas-fir forest landscape surrounding Cheesman Lake in central Colorado were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees and inferences from forest stand ages. We crossdated 153 fire-scarred trees from an approximately 4000 ha study area that recorded 77 total fire years from 1197 to the present. Spatial extent of burned areas during fire years varied from the scale of single trees or small clusters of trees to fires that burned across the entire landscape. Intervals between fire years varied from 1 to 29 years across the entire landscape to 3 to 58 years in one stand, to over 100 years in other stands. Large portions of the landscape did not record any fire for a 128 year-long period from 1723 to 1851. Fire severity varied from low-intensity surface fires to large-scale, stand-destroying fires, especially during the 1851 fire year but also possibly during other years. Fires occurred throughout tree growing seasons and both before and after growing seasons. These results suggest that the fire regime has varied considerably across the study area during the past several centuries. Since fires influence plant establishment and mortality on the landscape, these results further suggest that vegetation patterns changed at multiple scales during this period. The fire history from Cheesman Lake documents a greater range in fire behavior in ponderosa pine forests than generally has been found in previous studies.																			0921-2973					DEC	1999	14	6					513	532		10.1023/A:1008137005355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008137005355													WOS:000082563500001

In the Isunnguata Sermia and Russell Glacier catchments of western Greenland, a 50% decline in driving stress along a flow line is juxtaposed with increasing surface flow speed. Here, these circumstances are investigated using modern observational data sources and an analysis of the balance of forces. Stress gradients in the ice mass and basal drag which resist the local driving stress are computed in order to investigate the underlying processes influencing the velocity and stress regimes. Our results show that the largest resistive stress gradients along the flowline result from increasing surface velocity. However, the longitudinal coupling stresses fail to exceed 15 kPa, or 20% of the local driving stress. Consequently, computed basal drag declines in proportion to the driving stress. In the absence of significant resistive stress gradients, other mechanisms are therefore necessary to explain the observed velocity increase despite declining driving stress. In the study area, the observed velocity-driving stress feature occurs at the long-term mean position of the equilibrium line of surface mass balance. We hypothesize that this position approximates the inland limit where seasonal surface meltwater penetrates the bed, and that the increased surface velocity reflects enhanced basal motion associated with these meltwater perturbations.

Similar patterns of use for lake and inlet streams have been described for both native and introduced populations. However, for many introduced rainbow trout populations, there is a lack of information about how and when those habitats have been used. Here, we hypothesized that the majority of adult and sexually mature individuals inhabit inlet streams during the reproductive period most likely to spawn whereas juvenile trout occupy these same streams as nursery areas most of the year before emigrating to the lake. We studied rainbow trout age distribution and sexual maturity in a lake and its main inlet streams in southern Chile. We found that stream-dwelling individuals inhabited inlet streams up to age 2(+) whereas lake-dwelling trout were older (most of them from ages 4(+) to 6(+)). During the reproductive period (May to September) older and sexually mature individuals were in both habitats probably indicating movement to upstream locations to spawn. Rainbow trout of the same ages were larger in the lake than in streams, which may imply better growth in the lenthic environment. Our study offers further evidence of the highly adaptable nature of rainbow trout. Future regulations should consider rainbow trout populations in lakes and streams separately because trout life histories suggest that both environments are important to different ontogenic stages. This study provides key information that may be useful in the management of ad-fluvial populations of rainbow trout in Patagonia.

Temperature variability at Durres Maar, Germany during the Migration Period and at High Medieval Times, inferred from stable carbon isotopes of Sphagnum cellulose	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												This paper presents a high resolution reconstruction of local growing season temperature (GST) anomalies at Durres Maar, Germany, spanning the last two millennia. The GST anomalies were derived from a stable carbon isotope time series of cellulose chemically extracted from Sphagnum leaves (delta C-13(cellulose)) separated from a kettle-hole peat deposit of several metres thickness. The temperature reconstruction is based on the Sphagnum delta C-13(cellulose)/temperature dependency observed in calibration studies. Reconstructed GST anomalies show considerable centennial and decadal scale variability. A cold and presumably wet phase with below-average temperature is reconstructed between the 4th and 7th century AD which is in accordance with the so called European Migration Period, marking the transition from the Late Roman Period to the Early Middle Ages. At High Medieval Times, the amplitude in the reconstructed temperature variability is most likely overestimated; nevertheless, above-average temperatures are obvious during this time span, which are followed by a temperature decrease. On the contrary, a pronounced Late Roman Climate Optimum, often described as similarly warm or even warmer as medieval times, could not be detected. The temperature signal of the Little Ice Age (LIA) is not preserved in Durres Maar due to considerable peat cutting that takes place in the first half of the 19th century. The local GST anomalies show a remarkable agreement to northern hemispheric temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring datasets and are also in accordance with climate reconstructions on the basis of lake sediments, glacier advances and retreats, and historical datasets. Most notably, e. g., during the Early Middle Ages and at High Medieval Times, temperatures were neither low nor high in general. Rather high frequency temperature variability with multiple narrow intervals of below-and above-average temperatures at maximum lasting a few decades are reconstructed. Especially the agreements between our estimated GST anomalies and temperature reconstructions derived from tree-ring chronologies indicate the great potential of Sphagnum delta C-13(cellulose) time series from peat deposits for palaeoclimate research. This is particularly the case, given that a quantitative delta C-13(cellulose)/temperature relationship has been found for several Sphagnum species. Although the time resolution of Sphagnum delta C-13(cellulose) datasets certainly wouldn't reach the annual resolution of tree-ring data, reconstructions of past temperature variability on the basis of this proxy hold one particular advantage: often due to relatively high peat accumulation rates, especially in kettle-hole bogs accumulated on temperate latitudes over periods of up to several millennia, they allow extending temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring series into the past to enhance our knowledge of natural climate variability during the Holocene.

Here, a three-dimensional, finite-volume model for predicting lake water quality is used to account for internal advection and diffusion, including the impacts of the inflowing rivers on the velocity field. We used parsimonious sub-models for the source/sink terms for temperature, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, phosphorous, phytoplankton, and zooplankton concentrations and tested the model predictions against field measurements from the Chahnimeh Reservoir in Iran. The modeled water quality parameters were in good agreement with the measured values. Results were notably poorer when the three-dimensionality of the model was removed. This study suggests that properly simulating three-dimensional advection is important to properly predict the distribution of pollutants within some lakes and reservoirs and that this model may be directly applicable to systems similar to Chahnimeh Reservoir.

The RVP orography supports a coherent distribution of agroecosystems and livelihoods, from hot irrigated lowlands to endangered afromontane forests above 1500 m.a.s.l. Recent increases in deforestation, land fragmentation and soil denudation/compaction in the densely populated TCS were combined with a strengthened need and consumption of water in the lower, warmer and drier end-member. Consistent with a regional decline of the long rains, a considerable (up to 30%) decrease in annual rainfall and a pervasive decline of the Lake Masoko (LM) aquifer testifies to a strong aridification trend. We suggest here that current landuse and demographic trends likely amplified the hydrological response of the TCS to regional and global warming. Testing such a hypothesis, however, requires improved local monitoring, to allow scaling and quantification of local hydrological budgets associated with landuse impacts, and evaluation of the contribution of trees and agroforestry systems to mitigating the aridification trend.					; Majule, Amos/ABD-5185-2020; Mwakisunga, Benard/GXA-1959-2022	MAJULE, AMOS/0000-0002-9928-7632; Mwakisunga, Benard/0000-0002-7862-6631; 													1877-3435	1877-3443				FEB	2014	6						116	122		10.1016/j.cosust.2013.11.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2013.11.014													WOS:000334005600020

Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is a suitable host for Gyrodactylus salaris (Monogenea, Gyrodactylidae) in Norway	PARASITOLOGY												Gyrodactylus specimens infecting both anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) from River Signaldalselva (northern Norway) and resident Arctic charr from Lake Palsbufjorden (southern Norway) were identified as G. salaris using molecular markers and morphometrics. The infection in Palsbufjorden represents the first record of a viable G. salaris population infecting a host in the wild in the absence of salmon (Salmo salar). G. salaris on charr from Signaldalselva and Palsbbufjorden bear different mitochondrial haplotypes. While parasites infecting charr in Signaldalselva carry the same mitochondrial haplotype as parasites from sympatric Atlantic salmon, G. salaris from charr in Palsbufjorden bear a haplotype that has previously been found in parasites infecting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon, and an IGS repeat arrangement that is very similar to those observed earlier in parasites infecting rainbow trout. Accordingly, the infection may result from 2 subsequent host-switches (from salmon via rainbow trout to charr). Morphometric analyses revealed significant differences between G. salaris infecting charr in the 2 localities, and between those on sympatric chart and salmon within Signaldalselva. These differences may reflect adaptations to a new host species, different environmental conditions, and/or inherited differences between the G. salaris strains. The discovery of G. salaris on populations of both anadromous and resident chart may have severe implications for Atlantic salmon stock-management as charr may represent a reservoir for infection of salmon.

J	Zhang, HC; Cao, ZH; Shen, QR; Wong, MH				Zhang, HC; Cao, ZH; Shen, QR; Wong, MH			Effect of phosphate fertilizer application on phosphorus (P) losses from paddy soils in Taihu Lake Region I. Effect of phosphate fertilizer rate on P losses from paddy soil	CHEMOSPHERE												A field plot study was conducted on two types of paddy soils in the Taihu Lake Region, during the rice season of year 2000 in order to assess phosphorus (P) losses by runoff and vertical leaching, which are considered the two main pathways of P movement from paddy soil into its surrounding water course. Commercial NPK compound fertilizer and single superphosphate fertilizer were applied to furnish 0, 30, 150, and 300 kg applied P ha m(-2). The experiments consisted of three replicates of each treatment in Changshu site and four replicates in Anzhen site, with a plot size of 5 x 6 m(2) in a randomized block. Results revealed that the average concentration range for total P (TP) in runoff was 1.857-7.883, 1.0385.209, 0.783-1.255 and 0.572-0.691 mg P1(-1) respectively for P300, P150, P30 and P0 in Anzhen, while it was 2.431-2.449, 1.578-1.890, 1.050-1.315 and 0.749-0.941 mg P1(-1) respectively in Changshu. In all treatments, particulate P (PP) represented a major portion of the TP lost in runoff, it was 80% in Anzhen, and it was even more (>90%) in Changshu. Phosphate fertilizer treatments significantly affected P concentrations and P loads in the runoff. The mean concentration and average seasonal TP load from the P150 plots were 1.809 mg P1(-1) and 395 g P ha m(-2) season(-1) respectively, and lower than that from the P300 plots (2.957 mg P1(-1) and 652 g P ha m(-2) season(-1)). These were obviously higher than from the P30 (0.761 mg P1(-1) and 221 g P ha m(-2) season(-1)) and P0 (0.484 mg P1(-1) and 146 g P ha m(-2) season(-1)) respectively. There was no significant difference found between the P30 and the PO in both sites. Under usual P application rate, there were total 31.7 and 20.6 tones P removed by runoff from permeable (Anzhen site) and waterlogged (Changshu site) paddy soils in the southern Jiangsu region (major part of the TLR) in the rice season of the year 2000. But if the P application rate is unusual high, or the Olsen P in soil accumulates to above a certain level, then this could sharply increase in the future. The average concentration of molybdate reactive phosphorus (MRP) in the vertical leachate from the four different P treatments ranged from 0.058 to 0.304 mg P1(-1) in Anzhen and from 0.048 to 0.394 mg P1(-1) in Changshu. P application rate significantly affected the MRP concentration at each depth in both sites, except for the 90 cm in Anzhen. The average MRP loads during the rice season moved by vertical leaching from the four treatments ranged from 163 to 855 g P ha m(-2) season(-1) in Anzhen and 208-1825 g P ha m(-2) season(-1) in Changshu. Vertical leachate movement does not necessarily mean that it moves towards surface water and contaminate the watercourses in this flat plain paddy soil region, it does, however, imply that P can move down from surface layers of soil to deeper levels.

J	Brett, MT; Müller-Navarra, DC; Park, SK				Brett, MT; Müller-Navarra, DC; Park, SK			Empirical analysis of the effect of phosphorus limitation on algal food quality for freshwater zooplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Herbivorous zooplankton production is often constrained by algal food quality, and Variation in algal food quality has been attributed to its phosphorus (P) content. To test the hypothesis that mineral P limitation is an important constraint on freshwater herbivorous zooplankton production, we conducted a quantitative analysis of published data on lake seston carbon to phosphorus (C:P) ratios and daphnid growth responses to P-limited algal diets. Our summary of 276 observations of mean lake seston C:P ratios showed 38% exceeded a critical threshold of 300, above which daphnid production is often predicted to be limited by algal P content. Our analysis of 91 observations of daphnid growth responses to nutrient-limited algal diets indicates the true daphnid critical threshold lies within the range of 225-375. Algal food quality is consistently reduced at algal C:P ratios above 300; however, the predicted reduction in algal food quality with P limitation is greater than the observed reduction at critical thresholds <390. Mineral P limitation of Daphnia production may be quite strong in some lakes; however, the production of most zooplankton taxa would not be expected to be limited by mineral P in a large proportion of lakes. After correcting for the algal C:P ratio, large differences in food quality were found between the major algal taxa, with diatoms and cryptophytes high food quality, chlorophytes intermediate food quality, and small ingestible cyanophytes very low food quality. A Monte Carlo simulation indicated that shifts in aIgal community composition similar to those seen during seasonal succession or across lake trophic state gradients explained four times more variability in daphnid growth rates across a range of seston C:P ratios representative of natural lakes. Overall these results tend to support the mineral P Limitation hypothesis for daphnids, but they also suggest other factors will be the primary determinants of algal food quality for most zooplankters in most lakes.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2000	45	7					1564	1575		10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1564	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1564													WOS:000165267100011

The sites are regularly flooded, eutrophic, and often shaded by surrounding vegetation. Cryptophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Euglenophyceae dominated the phytoplankton, while Cyanophytes were rare. Within the rich zooplankton assemblage (63 species), cladocerans and rotifers dominated. Correlation matrices and multivariate analyses indicated that shaded and relatively deeper sites had lower oxygen saturation and higher concentrations of PO4-P and NH4-N. Shade and relative depth correlated negatively with phytoplankton biomass and number of phytoplankton taxa, and positively with Cryptophytes and large cladocerans-thus indicating poor mixing, poor light availability and low fish pressure on herbivores. Decomposition of leaf litter increased oxygen consumption, while shade from terrestrial vegetation restricted photosynthesis and decreased oxygen production. Larger sites were more species-rich in phytoplankton and supported Euglenophyceae, green algae and rotifers.

J	Djamali, M; Segarra-Moragues, JG				Djamali, Morteza; Segarra-Moragues, Jose Gabriel			Palaeoecology and conservation of endangered hidden species; example of the liverwort Riella (Riellaceae)	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Palaeoecology is increasingly contributing to conservation biology and restoration ecology by extending the recent annual to decennial records of ecological observations to centennial and millennial time scales. One of the almost neglected potential applications of palaeoecological investigations in conservation biology is the discovering of hidden species in subrecent fossil records. Such discoveries can be common in biodiversity hotspots in which the fauna and flora are not still fully known. In this study, we present the case of the liverwort Riella in continental southwest Asia (Iranian plateau), a very vulnerable taxon growing and reproducing under very special ecological circumstances. Our study adds two new species of Riella (R. echinata and R. helicophylla) in addition to the formerly reported R. cossoniana, to the subfossil bryophyte flora of Iran. We demonstrate the important contribution that the genus has played in the history of wetland flora of the semi-arid to arid areas of Iran during the late Quaternary. We further demonstrate the possibility that it is still thriving in many wetland systems and may need to be discovered and then protected in its potential habitats. We suggest that in the biodiversity hotspots of lower latitudes, more attention has to be paid to taxonomic identification of species to reveal the hidden part of the biodiversity for defining better conservation strategies for vulnerable aquatic ecosystems such as the seasonal wetland systems.

J	Chalkia, E; Kehayias, G				Chalkia, Ekaterini; Kehayias, George			Zooplankton and environmental factors of a recovering eutrophic lake (Lysimachia Lake, Western Greece)	BIOLOGIA												The present study investigates the zooplankton community dynamics and the abiotic environment in the eutrophic Lake Lysimachia (western Greece). The lake is considered to be recovering from eutrophication after the termination of an urban sewage inflow in 2000, and its waters are replenished constantly from the nearby oligotrophic Lake Trichonis. The results show that, although a decrease in nutrient concentrations was observed compared to the past, the lake still has eutrophic characteristics. This was reflected in the zooplankton community which is typical of those found in eutrophic lakes where rotifers prevail. Similarities among this lake and other nearby lakes were found considering the zooplankton community composition and seasonal variation. However, Lake Lysimachia is inhabited also by a number of different and even unique species (e.g., Moina micrura), suggesting that this ecosystem may be an important biodiversity refuge. Most of the zooplankton species were correlated with water temperature and, to a lesser extent, eutrophication key-water quality variables. Although there are few available data on the zooplankton of the lake, the abundance and composition of the community presenting characteristics indicative of intermediate trophic conditions and suggesting that the lake is probably under a kind of "biological" recovery.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				JUN	2013	68	3					459	469		10.2478/s11756-013-0171-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0171-9													WOS:000317645900013

Population Assessment of an Endangered Shorebird: the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus melodus) in Eastern Canada	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Small, at-risk populations are those for which accurate demographic information is most crucial to conservation and recovery, but also where data collection is constrained by logistical challenges and small sample sizes. Migratory animals in particular may experience a wide range of threats to survival and reproduction throughout each annual cycle, and identification of life stages most critical to persistence may be especially difficult for these populations. The endangered eastern Canadian breeding population of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus melodus) was estimated at only 444 adults in 2005, and extensive effort has been invested in conservation activities, reproductive monitoring, and marking of individual birds, providing a comprehensive data set on population dynamics since 1998. We used these data to build a matrix projection model for two Piping Plover population segments that nest in eastern Canada in order to estimate both deterministic and stochastic rates of population growth (lambda(d) and lambda(s), respectively). Annual population censuses suggested moderate growth in abundance between 1998-2003, but vital rate estimates indicated that this temporary growth may be replaced by declines in the long term, both in southern Nova Scotia (lambda(d) = 1.0043, lambda(s) = 0.9263) and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (lambda(d) = 0.9651, lambda(s) = 0.8214). Nonetheless, confidence intervals on lambda estimates were relatively wide, highlighting remaining uncertainty in future population trajectories. Differences in projected growth between regions appear to be driven by low estimated juvenile post-fledging survival in the Gulf, but threats to juveniles of both population segments following departure from nesting beaches remain unidentified. Similarly, lambda in both population segments was particularly sensitive to changes in adult survival as expected for most migratory birds, but very little is understood about the threats to Piping Plover survival during migration and overwintering. Consequently, we suggest that future recovery efforts for these and other vulnerable migrants should quantify and manage the largely unknown sources of both adult and juvenile mortality during non-breeding seasons while maintaining current levels of nesting habitat protection.																			1712-6568					DEC	2006	1	3							4															WOS:000208195300004

Variations in fatty acids composition of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) liver with respect to gonad maturation	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We examined seasonal variations in liver condition factor, total lipid and fatty acid composition of maturing pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) from Lake Egirdir, Turkey. The spawning of pikeperch in Egirdir Lake started in March, continued very fast during May and gradually ended in July as determined by measuring the gonadosomatic index. The total lipid content of male and female liver reached its highest level in September and November (the end of dense feeding period during which temperature decreased sharply), but declined to the lowest level in May Oust after spawning). The highest level of liver condition factor was observed in January and March during which gonads mature rapidly. Palmitic acid was the predominant saturated fatty acid (SFA) in female and male liver. The ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was higher than that of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in both sexes. Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), eicosopentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) were the predominant PUFA. Seasonal variations in PUFA were more evident than that in other fatty acids. PUFA, especially the n-3 fatty acids ratio, increased to the maximum level during the sharp decreases in temperature (in November). However, the amount of PUFA decreased to the lowest level in reproductive period. The results suggest that the ratio of pikeperch liver fatty acids is influenced by gonad maturation and temperature variations and that pikeperch requires a large amount of PUFA and the n-3 fatty acids for the development of gonads.

This study presents the implementation, validation and application of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to a system comprising a section of the Huai River and Hongze Lake, China. The validated model enabled the identification of hydrodynamic characteristics by analysing the flow patterns under the influence of the local flow regulation. Effective flow regulation measures during flood period reduced the retention time of floodwater in the lake and contributed to a low-velocity current field in the northern part of the river-lake system. Throughout the non-flood period, a distinctive flow pattern emerged due to persistent easterly winds, resulting in a dual circulation pattern in the interconnected region between the northern and central segments of the system. The investigation of flow patterns revealed the creation of stagnant water zones in the northern sector of Hongze Lake. Distributing a substantial portion of outflow discharge to the Erhezha gate could lead to an expansion of the flood passing area by scenario analysis. Simultaneously, implementing intermittent control over the Erhezha gate drainage effectively heightened the current velocities in the stagnant water zone. The deliberate allocation of outflow discharge has a substantial impact on the flow dynamics within a vast river-lake system during the flood season, which carries significant research potential in enhancing the local water self-purification capacity and water quality.					; Zhang, Hong/H-2289-2011; Zhang, Fuxin/IYJ-7245-2023; Stewart, Rodney/H-5561-2018; Yuan, Saiyu/ABH-9996-2020; Jin, Guangqiu/B-2590-2012; Bertone, Edoardo/L-1000-2019; Bertone, Edoardo/V-5687-2018	Zhang, Fuxin/0009-0002-8077-2053; Stewart, Rodney/0000-0002-6013-3505; Zhang, Hong/0000-0002-2642-5467; Bertone, Edoardo/0000-0002-9980-5268													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2024	633								131015	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131015		MAR 2024											WOS:001203746700001

Seasonal clearance rates were derived from the TPM budget assuming two resuspension scenarios: no resuspension and full resuspension of biodeposits. Estimated clearance rates for both scenarios were compared with the rates calculated from the population clearance rate model. Seasonal clearance rates estimated using the population model ( 1.1 and 11.8 l g(-1) SFDW day(-1)) fitted well into the interval of seasonal clearance rates calculated from TPM budgets assuming no resuspension of biodeposits (3.2 and 21.4 l g SFDW-1 day(-1)). In the scenario with biodeposits resuspension clearance rates were much higher (57.4 and 148.9 g SFDW-1 day(-1)). The ratio of clearance to residence time was highly dependent on the fate of biodeposits. Therefore its use in interpretation of the species impact on TPM was limited. An alternative measure based on the ratio of the amount of TPM biodeposited to TPM transported into the bed was used. It was found that zebra mussels are able to deposit between 10 and 30% of the incoming TPM, and the amount of biodeposited material was correlated with water residence time. Results indicate that the impact of zebra mussels on TPM in the lagoon is small relative to the high transport rates of TPM over the bed. However, annual biosedimentation rate ( similar to 590 g m(-2)) in the mussel bed was higher than physical deposition rate similar to 380 g m(-2)) in accumulation areas devoid of large suspension feeders. We suggest that a local impact due to enhanced availability of organic material to other trophic groups of associated benthic organisms may be more significant than effects on TPM pathways at an ecosystem scale.

The diversity of amphibians and reptiles was assessed based on quantitative data of species captures using nonparametric diversity indices, species richness accumulation curves, and similarity analysis. At the Region of Oued Righ (Northern Sahara Desert), we identified 3 amphibians, 19 lizards, and 1 0 ophidian species. These 32 species (approximately 3 0% of the Algerian herpetofauna) were classified into 2 orders (Anura and Squamata), 15 families, and 23 different genera. The study area included 8 protected species in Algeria and 9 endemic species to the Mediterranean region, including 1 amphibian and 7 species of reptiles. Acanthodactylus dumerilii was the most abundant species (2 0.5% of the total), whereas Chalcides ocellatus occurred in 32.9% of specimens. The highest values of species richness were recorded in palm groves with 22 species and Shannon 's diversity index (H ') was 3.5, whereas the lowest values were obtained in Sabkhas (5 species) and urban sites (7 species).The number of individuals experienced significant variations between study biotopes and seasons. Overall, species richness estimators (Chao2 and Jackknife1) revealed that the current survey achieved 9 0% of inventory completeness. Estimates and interpolations of species richness showed higher values in urban sites, palm groves, desert pavements, and wadis compared to Sabkhas and lowlands where completeness ranged between 9 0% and 1 00%. The analysis of similarity indicated low similarity values (<5 0%) between biotopes studied. The highest similarities were noted between the mesic biotopes (Sabkhas, wadis, and palm groves), the xeric and undisturbed biotopes (desert pavements and lowlands), whereas urban sites showed a distinct herpetofaunal community that was completely different of that recorded in Sabkhas, wadis, and lowlands.

J	Martin, S; Proulx, I; Hare, L				Martin, Sylvain; Proulx, Isabelle; Hare, Landis			Explaining metal concentrations in sympatric Chironomus species	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We compared metal concentrations in larvae of two Chironomus species (Chironomus staegeri and Chironomus tigris) living in the same lake and at the same depth and time. Concentrations of the nonessential metal cadmium (Cd) differed greatly (> 8x) between the two species, whereas those of two essential metals differed either much less (zinc [Zn], 23) or not at all (copper [Cu]). These trends were constant in all seasons. On the one hand, differences in Cd and Zn concentrations between the species were not explained by differences in either their size or their life cycle. Likewise, differential exposure to dissolved metals did not explain larval Cd and Zn concentrations because vertical gradients in dissolved metals did not correlate with depths of larval feeding. On the other hand, the species differed in the type of sediment that they consumed, and measurements of sulfur stable isotopes in larvae confirmed that whereas C. staegeri consumes mostly surface oxic sediment, C. tigris eats mainly deeper anoxic sediment. Because total metal concentrations in gut contents were not correlated with those in larvae, it is likely that metal bioavailability differs between the two sediment types. Overall, our results show that because metal concentrations can differ widely between sympatric congeners, extrapolation from one Chironomus species to another may not be justifiable. Furthermore, because larvae exposed to Zn in the laboratory did not accumulate this metal as they would in the field, we suggest that care is warranted when extrapolating from results obtained in laboratory tests to animals living in the field.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2008	53	2					411	419		10.4319/lo.2008.53.2.0411	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.2.0411													WOS:000256498700001
J	de la Fuente, A; Meruane, C				de la Fuente, Alberto; Meruane, Carolina			Dimensionless numbers for classifying the thermodynamics regimes that determine water temperature in shallow lakes and wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												The influence of sediments in the heat budget of water bodies has been reported to be determinant in shallow lakes and wetlands, whereas it is usually neglected in larger water bodies. In this article, we address the question of whether or not sediments should be considered in the computation of water temperature, by defining two dimensionless numbers that describe the thermodynamics regimes of shallow lakes and wetlands. These dimensionless numbers rise from the analysis of the role of periodic heat exchanges at the sediment-water interface (SWI) on the water temperature of shallow lakes and wetlands. The analysis was based on the derivation of an analytic solution that adopts the solution for the second Stokes problem for computing the sediment temperature, when the system is forced by periodic (diurnal, seasonal, decadal) heat exchanges with the atmosphere. The first dimensionless number is the ratio between the thermal inertia of the active sediments and the thermal inertia of the water column, and quantifies the role of sediments on the heat budget. The second dimensionless number, on the other hand, is defined as the ratio between the timescale of changes in the external forcing and the timescale required to reach the heat equilibrium at the SWI, and characterizes the influence of turbulence on the water column on heat exchanges across the SWI. We complemented the analysis with field observations conducted in shallow lakes of 5-15 cm depth, whose thermodynamics is controlled by heat exchanges between the water column and the sediments. As the dimensionless numbers defined here are frequency dependent, we show that one particular process can be neglected for one specific frequency, while it cannot be neglected for other frequencies. In the case of lakes and deep wetlands, sediments could be neglected in a diurnal time-scale, while they should be included for seasonal or decadal time-scales. The relevance of this frequency-dependence is that it suggests that sediments should always be considered in long-term climatic simulations.					; de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/G-7018-2016	Meruane, Carolina/0009-0000-4887-3124; de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/0000-0001-5415-9816													1567-7419	1573-1510				DEC	2017	17	6					1081	1098		10.1007/s10652-017-9536-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-017-9536-x													WOS:000423098200001
J	Hamilton-Dyer, S; Brisbane, M; Maltby, M				Hamilton-Dyer, Sheila; Brisbane, Mark; Maltby, Mark			Fish, feather, fur and forest: Exploitation of wild animals in medieval Novgorod and its territory	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The city of Novgorod the Great in north-west Russia has been subjected to extensive excavation of its superbly preserved medieval anaerobic deposits for many decades. Situated on the River Volkhov near Lake Ilmen and surrounded by mixed boreal and deciduous woodland and seasonally flooded meadowlands, Novgorod was well-placed for the exploitation of local wild fauna and flora. It was also the focus for international trade in furs obtained from a much broader catchment area. Although its inhabitants relied heavily on domestic animals and crops for their food, evidence for the acquisition of wild resources is also provided by animal bones, plant macrofossils, birch-bark documents and other archaeological finds. Pollen analysis has also provided information about landscape history of its hinterland. Even from a limited programme of sieved sampling, it is clear that a very large number of fish bones were present in the deposits. The main taxa are cyprinids, pike and zander, whereas birch-bark documents, largely concerned with tribute, mention salmonids and sturgeon, rare amongst the excavated remains. The wild bird assemblage is dominated by various species of ducks. Other waterfowl were utilised as well as large game birds such as capercaillie. Birds of prey are also present and other remains such as jackdaws reveal the local bird life in town. Wild mammals contributed little to the Novgorodian diet: bones of hare, beaver and elk being the most frequently found. Very few bones of fur-bearing mammals were recovered. The few remains include bear claws and bones of squirrel, marten, otter, and fox, in addition to beaver. Their paucity can be explained by the fact that most would have arrived from the hunting grounds to the north as prepared pelts without bones. Evidence for the hunting for these species is provided on sites deep within the forest zone such as Minino. Most of the wild animals eaten in Novgorod itself were obtained from the land and waters of its near hinterland. The paper discusses the character of the local forest based on pollen and other evidence. Models are being developed to provide a more detailed understanding of the changes in the composition of the forest during the medieval period and the consequences this had for wildlife. The paper demonstrates the benefits of developing a multidisciplinary approach comparing urban assemblages with contemporary sites in its hinterland and further afield, to understand more fully how wild species were exploited in complex societies.

Occurrence and seasonal dynamics of metalimnetic Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) in a stratified meromictic tropical lake and its implications for zooplankton community distribution	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM) is an important feature of stratified lakes and oceans but very little is known about the phenomenon in tropical systems. Proximate factors accounting for DCM presence include light, thermal stratification and nutrients but biotic interactions such as zooplankton grazing can actively support DCM formation, structure and maintenance. We examined DCM characteristics in tropical Lake Bosumtwi at biweekly intervals between April and July of 2005 and 2006 and also assessed zooplankton herbivore interactions with the DCM. The onset and development of the seasonal DCM peak was based on stable water column, steep thermocline, availability of a nutricline and nutrient limitation in the epilimnion. Euphotic depth doubled during DCM formation and increasing transparency tripled DCM Chl a in the metalimnion just below the oxycline. DCM, however, disaggregated with seasonally induced deeper mixing. The range of variability in surface chlorophyll did not differ significantly between seasonal and aseasonal DCM period. There was about one-fourth difference between mean surface and metalimnetic chlorophyll concentrations but this shift in resource location did not trigger a descent to deeper waters by herbivores. Herbivore grazing could not be linked to surface variations in water clarity and deep-water irradiance needed for DCM formation and maintenance. DCM presence therefore was not enhanced by surface water grazing activities of zooplankton. This suppressed biotic influence indicated that DCM dynamics is driven by lake clarity, thermal and nutrient gradients which constitute key abiotic drivers. Direct consumption of the DCM by herbivorous zooplankton was not evident and the energy therein is possibly lost to the anoxic deep waters of the lake through sedimentation. The sinking organic matter could be returned to the pelagic food web via the microbial loop represented by bacteria, ciliates and heterotrophic/mixotrophic flagellates inhabiting the lake's deep layers.

These differed in their morphometric and trophic characteristics, but all contained fish communities dominated by vendace (Coregonus albula L). Regression between the degree of coverage and the coefficient of variation was produced. The sampling error of abundance estimates was less than 10% at coverage higher than 2 for all the observations. Seasonal changes in fish spatial distribution did not affect the variability significantly. The zigzag survey design gave less variable results than regular parallel transects but the difference was not statistically significant. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sediment lithology, grain size, and C/N ratios showed distinct lithological phases, indicating past water-level fluctuations. The colonization of limnophytes took place right after the formation of the lake (after ca. 11,500 cal. BP). The earliest plant macrofossil assemblages indicate nutrient-rich conditions and a warmer climate than at present. After this primary succession phase, aquatic vascular plants were replaced by aquatic bryophytes (before ca. 10,200 cal. BP). Together with lithological evidence, we interpret this as being related to the lowering water table. According to palynological, chronological, and sedimentological evidence, Njargajavri underwent a very shallow phase between ca. 10,000 and 9500 cal. BP and dried out for an unknown period of time between ca. 8000 and 5000 cal. BP. After the dry phase, the water level started to rise and sedimentation at the coring point began again. Despite re-establishment of the lacustrine habitat, late-Holocene plant macrofossil data show no marked recolonization of either vascular limnophytes or bryophytes. The reason for all limnophytes being presently absent from the lake remains speculative. The lack of nutrients and/or the cooling climate (especially shortening of the open-water season) during the latter part of the Holocene may explain why limnophytes failed to recolonize the lake.

However, the temporal variations and main driving factors of CH4 fluxes in alpine wetlands are not yet well understood. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured from an alpine wetland in the Qinghai Lake using eddy covariance (EC) technique. Strong seasonal variability in the daily CH4 fluxes was observed, ranging from - 18.24 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the non-growing season to 117.44 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the growing season in 2017. The annual CH4 budget was 9.41 g CH4 m(- 2). The growing season CH4 flux accounted for 91.5 % of the annual budget. At the daily scale, the CH4 fluxes increased significantly as the net radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at 5 cm depth increased. Additionally, correlation analysis also revealed that daily CH4 flux was significantly related to CO2 flux when daily CO2 flux was negative, but there was no correlation when daily CO2 flux was positive. Path analysis showed that seasonal variations of soil temperature at 5 cm depth and CO2 flux had strong direct effects on daily CH4 fluxes.

The sediment samples of Dawen River, Yellow River, and Dongping Lake were collected, and the major elements, trace elements and organic matter geochemical composition of the samples were analyzed. Cluster analysis, characteristic element ratio method and graphic method were used to explore the geochemical characteristics of sediments and their environmental implication. The results show that the contents of SiO2, Na2O, TiO2 and Zr in sediments of Dawen River and Yellow River are relatively high, and the contents of iron and manganese oxides, organic matter, CaO, P2O5 and Sr in lake sediments are relatively high. That reveals the differences of sedimentary environments between the rivers and the lake. The contents of Sr and Zr in Dawen River are affected by the rapid migration of clastic materials in the upstream carbonate source area during the flood season; the delta Ce, Sigma REE and REE's ratios in the sediments of the Yellow River reflect the influence of the Loess source; and the distribution of elements changes along the flow direction during the flood season. The characteristics of pH, element composition and LREE & HREE fractionation of the lake sediments indicate that the sediment source is complex, and the lake environment is affected by the flood season. The study shows that the geochemical content and its variation characteristics of sediments effectively reveal the sedimentary environment, material composition and characteristics of flood season of rivers and the lake in the study area.

We propose a new larval habitat classification and a new larval sampling methodology. We also report some preliminary results illustrating the applicability of the methodology based on data collected in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest in a longitudinal study of two remote Yanomami communities, Parafuri and Toototobi. In these areas, we mapped and classified 112 natural breeding habitats located in low-order river systems based on their association with river flood pulses, seasonality and exposure to sun. Our classification rendered seven types of larval habitats: lakes associated with the river, which are subdivided into oxbow lakes and nonoxbow lakes, flooded areas associated with the river, flooded areas not associated with the river, rainfall pools, small forest streams, medium forest streams and rivers. The methodology for larval sampling was based on the accurate quantification of the effective breeding area, taking into account the area of the perimeter and subtypes of microenvironments present per larval habitat type using a laser range finder and a small portable inflatable boat. The new classification and new sampling methodology proposed herein may be useful in vector control programs.

Less is known of the changes in nutrient status following conversion of natural lakes into reservoirs. Here, we use historical hydrological and limnological data and paleolimnological records of sedimentary P accumulation to evaluate changes in nutrient storage in Lake Kinneret, Israel since similar to1860. Impoundment in 1932 increased water level fluctuations and altered seasonal hydrologic patterns in the lake. Geochemical analysis of sediment deposits indicated that bulk sediment and P accumulation rates in the central lake increased >600% following dam installation (1930s), draining of Lake Hula wetlands (1951-1957), and diversion of surface water outflow (1964 to present). Further, comparison of sedimentary P stratigraphies with long-term chemical records showed that the period of maximum P deposition corresponds to observed increases in whole-lake and in hypolimnetic P content, as well as epilimnetic biological changes indicative of ongoing eutrophication. Together, these patterns suggest that hydrologic management of natural lakes can increase sedimentary nutrient flux under circumstances where lake volume and water levels become more variable.

The plankton integrity index (P-IBI) is a highly utilized method for evaluating the ecological health of the lakes. This study took Dianchi Lake, located in the Yangtze River Basin, as the research object and analyzed the phytoplankton, zooplankton communities, and environmental factors at 11 sampling points in this lake during the wet season (July) in 2022 and the dry season (February) in 2023. The P-IBI was established to evaluate the health status of this lake ecosystem. The results showed that a total of 83 species of phytoplankton and 31 species of zooplankton were identified in Dianchi Lake, and the number of plankton species in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the wet season. The P-IBI evaluation results for the two hydrological periods were generally "good". Linear regression analysis showed that there was a certain negative correlation between the P-IBI value and the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI), and the evaluation results were generally in line with the actual situation of the water body. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that there was a significant correlation between the P-IBI and its constituent parameters and individual water quality environmental factors, such as total nitrogen (TN) and electrical conductivity (EC). In summary, by reducing errors caused by spatial and temporal changes across various hydrological periods, P-IBI represents a more scientifically rigorous technique for lake water ecological health assessments within a certain time range.

Spatiotemporal ecological risk evaluation and source identification of heavy metals and nutrients in the water and lake surface sediment in a protected catchment area of a volcanic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Indonesia has numerous lakes; however, research on the spatiotemporal sediment quality and source identification in lakes remains limited. The overaccumulation of heavy metals and nutrients in lakes severely threatens aquatic ecosystems. This study aims to identify potential sources of metallic deposits (Cu, Pb, Cr, Fe, Al, and Cd) and nutrients (TN and TP) in lake-surface sediment, utilizing enrichment factors (EF), geoaccumulation indices (I-geo), potential ecological risk indices (Er), and risk indices (RI). Multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson's correlation analysis, were conducted to pinpoint pollution sources linked to land use. Eight sampling sites for surface sediment and water were examined in both wet and dry seasons at Menjer Lake, chosen for its diverse applications in tourism, hydropower, floating net cages, and extensive agriculture in its catchment. Correlation and PCA results indicated that Pb, Fe, and Al mainly originate from tourism, while Al, Fe, TN, and TP are associated with agriculture. The highest average loading from land use was observed in agriculture (> 0.8), floating net cages (> 0.76), and tourism (> 0.68). Furthermore, the highest loading from nutrients and all metals were TP (> 0.71) and all metals (> 0.35), respectively. Ecological risk assessment revealed low to moderately polluted EFs and Igeo in the dry season. However, Menjer Lake's Er and RI for heavy metals were generally classified as unpolluted.

Effects of Flooding and Shade on Survival, Growth, and Leaf Gas Exchange of Bottomland Tree Species across the Great Lakes Region (USA)	FORESTS												Forested wetlands are common ecosystems within the Great Lakes region (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), USA. Projected increases in extreme flooding events and shifting disturbance regimes create challenges for tree regeneration. Forest managers are considering the use of enrichment planting to increase tree species diversity, but limited information is available that quantifies the interactions between the flooding and shade tolerances of candidate tree species. We used a microcosm experiment to manipulate shade and flooding conditions to determine the effects on early survival, growth, and leaf gas exchange of 23 different tree species that vary in shade and flood tolerance. Seedlings were planted in pots and placed in 227 L tanks that were randomly assigned to light reduction (full sun, 40% and 70% reduced sunlight) and flood treatments (water levels of 0, 14, or 27 cm below the soil surface). In general, flooding treatments had a greater influence on seedling growth and leaf gas exchange rates than light reduction treatments. Of the species studied, bald cypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) was the most flood-tolerant, but American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) and river birch (Betula nigra L.) were also highly tolerant of flooding conditions throughout the entire growing season. The flood tolerances of the remaining species varied, but none were tolerant of water table depths within 14 cm of the soil surface for the entire growing season. Most species did not respond to the shade treatments in terms of early growth, survival, and leaf gas exchange. When considering species for planting in forested wetlands, matching the flood tolerance of candidate species to local site hydrology is an important step.

Field and laboratory studies of fluorescence-based technologies for real-time tracking of cyanobacterial cell lysis and potential microcystins release	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Elevated levels of dissolved microcystins (MCs) in source water due to rapid cell lysis of harmful cyanobacterial blooms may pose serious challenges for drinking water treatment. Catastrophic cell lysis can result from outbreaks of naturally-occurring cyanophages - as documented in Lake Erie during the Toledo water crisis of 2014 and in 2019, or through the application of algaecides or water treatment chemicals. Real-time detection of cyanobacterial cell lysis in source water would provide a valuable tool for drinking water plant and reservoir managers. In this study we explored two real-time fluorescence-based devices, PhycoSens and PhycoLA, that can detect unbound phycocyanin (uPC) as a potential indication of cell lysis and MCs release. The PhycoSens was deployed at the Low Service pump station of the City of Toledo Lake Erie drinking water treatment plant from July 15 to October 19, 2022 during the annual cyanobacteria bloom season. It measured major algal groups and uPC in incoming lake water at 15-min intervals during cyanobacteria dominant and senescence periods. Intermittent uPC detections from the PhycoSens over a three-month period coincided with periods of increasing proportions of extracellular MCs relative to total (intracellular and extracellular) MCs, indicating potential for uPC use as an indicator of cyanobacterial cell integrity. Following exposures of laboratory-cultured MCs-producing Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-298 (120 mu g chlorophyll/L) to cyanophage Ma-LMM01, copper sulfate (0.5 and 1 mg Cu/L), sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate (PAK (R) 27, 6.7 and 10 mg H2O2/L), and potassium permanganate (2.5 and 4 mg/L), appearance of uPC coincided with elevated fractions of extracellular MCs. The PhycoLA was used to monitor batch samples collected daily from Lake Erie water exposed to algaecides in the laboratory. Concurrence of uPC signal and surge of dissolved MCs was observed following 24-h exposures to copper sulfate and PAK 27. Overall results indicate the appearance of uPC is a useful indicator of the onset of cyanobacterial cell lysis and the release of MCs when MCs are present.					; Tsai, Kuo-Pei/J-2820-2019	Chaffin, Justin/0000-0002-5372-4577; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 10	2024	920								171121	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171121		FEB 2024						38382604					WOS:001200054800001

The surface water both before and after disinfection was concentrated by adsorption on C-18 silica cartridges and the concentrates containing non-volatile organics were divided into different portions for chemical analyses and biological assays. The following in vitro tests were conducted on the water concentrates dissolved in DMSO: the Salmonella mutagenicity assay with S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100; the SOS Chromotest with Escherichia coli, the Microtox(R) and Mutatox(R) assays with Vibrio fischeri; and gene conversion, point mutation and mitochondrial DNA mutability assays with D7 diploid Saccharomices cerevisiae strain. The results show that the SOS Chromotest and the yeast assays are highly sensitive in detecting genotoxicity. The surface-water extracts were very often toxic to most of the test organisms considered, partially masking their potential mutagenic activity. Therefore, the assays with E. coli and with S. cerevisiae are more likely to show a mutagenic effect because these organisms are generally less sensitive to most toxic compounds. Among the tested disinfectants, NaClO and ClO2 increased water genotoxicity, whereas PAA was able to slightly reduce raw water activity. However, because the organic compounds in the lake water varied with the season of the year, the disinfection processes, at times, both increased and decreased the raw water activity.

J	Ojaveer, H; Simm, M; Lankov, A				Ojaveer, H; Simm, M; Lankov, A			Population dynamics and ecological impact of the non-indigenous Cercopagis pengoi in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Abundance of the exotic predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) in the Gulf of Riga has increased during the first ten years of invasion (1992-2001) and peaked with an annual mean of 420 +/- 109 (s.e.) ind. m(-3) in 2001. As a long-term mean, Cercopagis population reached its highest abundance in the first week of August (mean 269 ind. m(-3)) and the seasonal population development followed the course of water temperature. Presence of Cercopagis in the plankton community tended to last longer over the years by shifting its population development to earlier in the year. The latter correlated significantly (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.01) with a similar pattern of Eurytemora. After the invasion of Cercopagis, the annual mean abundance of Bosmina was significantly lower than during the pre-invasion time (t-test, p < 0.01). Although populations of the other mesozooplankton taxa did not follow this pattern at the annual scale, seasonal population development of copepod nauplii and Acartia has changed, which can be caused by the invasion. The mean share of Cercopagis in the diet of most abundant planktivorous fish remained low (<7%) but the cladoceran constituted a substantial portion in the fish diet during warm months. Consumption of Cercopagis by herring, Clupea harengus membras, and smelt, Osmerus eperlanus, increased with increasing fish size. This was not evident in the case of sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius. The study points out that the invasion of Cercopagis has caused changes in zooplankton dynamics. Therefore, dietary overlap with fish larvae and planktivorous fish may occur in the Gulf of Riga.

This record reveals three time intervals of comparable warmth: anno Domini (A.D.) 0-300, 850-1200, and post-1800, the latter two of which correspond to the Medieval Climatic Anomaly and climatic amelioration after the end of the Little Ice Age. The Little Ice Age culminated at A.D. 1700, when the climate was approximate to1.7 degreesC colder than at present. A marked climatic cooling also occurred around A.D. 600, coinciding with extensive glacial advances in Alaska. Comparisons of this temperature record with ostracode trace-element ratios (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) further suggest that colder periods were wetter and vice versa during the past 2000 years.

The aim of this study is to investigate the long-term changes in CDOM in shallow and eutrophic Chaohu Lake, as well as its relationship with climate, environment and social factors. Using long time series Landsat image data and machine learning technology, the spatiotemporal evolution of Chaohu CDOM since 1987 was reconstructed. A total of 180 samples were collected, which were divided into three parts based on regional and hydrological characteristics. The results show that the water quality in different regions were significantly different, and TN may be the key factor driving the change of CDOM in Chaohu Lake. Machine learning algorithms including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), neural network (NN), multimodal deep learning (MDL) model and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used, among which XGBoost model performed best (R-2 = 0.955, mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.024 mg/L, root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.036 mg/L, bias = 1.005) and was used for CDOM spatiotemporal variation retrieval. The change of CDOM was seasonal, highest in August (0.67 m(-1)) and lowest in December (0.48 m(-1)), and the western lake is the main source of CDOM. Annual variability of the CDOM indicates that it began to decline after the completion of water pollution control in 2000. Temperature changes were closely related to CDOM (P < 0.01) and agricultural non-point source pollution plays an important role in Chaohu Lake. This study will provide feasible methods and scientific basis for the long-term remote sensing supervision of CDOM.

High-resolution paleosalinity reconstruction from Laguna de la Leche, north coastal Cuba, using Sr, O, and C isotopes	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Isotopes of Sr, O, and C were studied from a 227-cm long sediment core in order to develop a high-resolution paleosalinity record to investigate the paleohydrology of Laguna de la Leche, north coastal Cuba, during the Middle to Late Holocene. Palynological, plant macrofossil, foraminiferal, ostracode, gastropod, and charophyte data from predominantly euryhaline taxa, coupled with a radiocarbon-based chronology, indicate that the wetland evolved through four phases: (1) an oligohaline (0.5-5 parts per thousand) lake existed from similar to 6200 to similar to 4800 cal yr B.P.; (2) water level in the lake increased and the system freshened from similar to 4800 to similar to 4200 cal yr B.P.; (3) a mesohaline (5-18 parts per thousand) lagoon replaced the lake similar to 4200 cal yr B.P.; and (4) mangroves enclosed the lagoon beginning similar to 1700 cal yr B.P., forming a mesohaline lake. Isotopic ratios were measured on specimens of the euryhaline foraminifer Ammonia beccarii, although several measurements were also made on other calcareous microfossils in order to identify potential taphonomic and/or vital effects. The Sr-87/Sr-86 results show that the average salinity of Laguna de la Leche was similar to 1.7 parts per thousand during the early lake phase and similar to 8 parts per thousand during the lagoon phase - a change driven by relative sea level rise. The delta O-18 results do not record the salinity increase seen in the Sr-87/Sr-86 data, but instead indicate high evaporation from the lake surface; this in turn suggests that the value of similar to 1.7 parts per thousand may slightly underestimate the average salinity of the wetland, at least for the period prior to - 4800 cal yr B.P. Variability in delta C-13 was controlled by plant productivity, episodic marine incursions, and vegetation community change. There is some evidence for seasonal effect and the lateral transport of microfossils prior to burial. The isotopic data independently confirm the hydrological interpretations made using the euryhaline indicators and have permitted the reconstruction of a significantly higher resolution paleosalinity record than would be possible using the paleoecological data. However, our results show that Sr isotopes, while often cited as a powerful paleosalinity tool, must be used in conjunction with other indicators when investigating paleosalinity trends; relying solely on any single isotopic or ecological indicator can lead to inaccurate results, especially in semi-enclosed and closed hydrological systems.

Circulation and thermal structure in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay: Application of a nested-grid hydrodynamic model	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A nested-grid hydrodynamic modelling system is used to study circulation and temperature distributions in Lake Huron (LH) and adjacent areas. This nested system is based on the three-dimensional, primitive-equation z-level ocean model. The nested system consists of two sub-components: a coarse-resolution outer model covering LH and Georgian Bay (GB) with a horizontal resolution of roughly 2.5 km, and the fine-resolution inner model covering eastern LH and northwestern GB with a horizontal resolution of roughly 900 m. Both the outer and inner models have 30 z-levels in the vertical. To assess the model performance, we simulate the three-dimensional circulation and temperature distributions of LH and GB in 1974-1975 and compare the model results with observations made in the lake. We demonstrate that outer model of the nested system simulates reasonably well the large-scale circulation and seasonal evolution of thermal stratifications in LH and GB, and the inner model produces reasonably well the three-dimensional flow and thermal structure over the coastal boundary layer close to the eastern shore of the lake.

Growth-climate relationships across topographic gradients in the northern Great Lakes	ECOHYDROLOGY												Climatic conditions exert important control over the growth, productivity, and distribution of forests, and characterizing these relationships is essential for understanding how forest ecosystems will respond to climate change. We used dendrochronological methods to develop climate-growth relationships for two dominant species, Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen) and Pinus resinosa (red pine), in the upper Great Lakes region to understand how climate and water availability influence annual forest productivity. Trees were sampled along a topographic gradient at the Marcell Experimental Forest (Minnesota, USA) to assess growth response to variations in temperature and different water availability metrics (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET), cumulative moisture index (CMI), and soil water storage). Climatic variables were able to explain 33-58% of the variation in annual growth (as measured by ring-width increment) for quaking aspen and 37-74% of the variation for red pine. Climate-growth relationships were influenced by topography for quaking aspen but not for red pine. Annual ring growth for quaking aspen decreased with June CMI on ridges, decreased with temperature in the November prior to the growing season on sideslopes, and decreased with June PET on toeslopes. Red pine growth increased with increasing July PET across all topographic positions. These results indicate the sensitivity of both quaking aspen and red pine to local climate and show several vulnerabilities of these species to shifts in water supply and temperature because of climate change.

The studied reservoir has high diversities in phytoplankton with total number of 282 species. The average density of phytoplankton was 2.301 x 10(7) ind/L (individuals/liter). A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was carried out indicating that pH, total nitrogen (TN), and temperature; dissolved oxygen (DO) and turbidity (NTU) were the dominant environmental factors; while Microcystis incerta and Tetrachlorella alternans were the dominant phytoplankton. Chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and total organic carbon (TOC) showed no significant correlation with location and time, while the pH values showed a dependence on location and time. Values of the nutrient elements such as total phosphorus (TP) and NH4+-N varied over time and location. The density of phytoplankton varied with seasons and presented wave properties at different monitoring stations. Species diversity of the phytoplankton community varied in terms of evenness rather than dominance. Dactlocococcopsis fascicularis, Dictyosphaerium pulchellum, Gloeoactinium limneticum, Chlorella vulgaris, Ulothrix sp., and Cyclotella sp. showed a positive correlation with temperature, turbidity, TP and TN, and a negative correlation with TOC and DO, while Scenedesmus quadricarda, Geminella minor, Chroomonas acuta, Dictyosphaerium enrenbergianum, Fragilria brevistriata, and Synedra acus showed a positive correlation with DO, pH, TOC, and salinity. Risk of algae bloom in the reservoir is more likely to occur during the full operational stage; variations of phytoplankton were influenced mainly by seasonal and spatial conditions rather than by operational stages and environmental factors.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2016	227	9							352	10.1007/s11270-016-3062-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3062-1													WOS:000382761400060

INFLUENCE OF REGIONAL FACTORS ON ZOOPLANKTON STRUCTURE IN A SALINE LOWLAND RIVER: THE SALADO RIVER (BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE, ARGENTINA)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Knowledge of regional factors influencing zooplankton structure in a semiarid river must include both the main channel and any tributaries in order to identify spatial and temporal patterns along with the main factor that affect the zooplankton community. Accordingly, seasonal samples were taken during 1997-1999 at 15 stations in the Salado River basin, where 172 species were identified (53 protozoans, 88 rotifers and 31 crustaceans). Conductivity and temperature optima and tolerances were calculated for the evident taxa. Different assemblages were recognized by Cluster analysis, on the basis of their temperature and conductivity preferences. With respect to the zooplankton assemblages, three zones can be distinguished along the longitudinal axis of the basin: (1) the headwaters (the effluent from large Saline shallow lakes), (2) the inter-tributaries, and (3) the lower basin and associated shallow lakes. The spatial distribution of the assemblages was a result of the combined action of factors always promoting the dominance of rotifers. The influence of floodplain waters (backwater ponds, waterlogged depressions, flushing lakes) was attenuated progressively downstream, thus producing disadvantages for the crustaceans. The food availability and high nutrient concentrations related to land use in the headwaters favoured the co-dominance of cladocerans and copepods along with the rotifers in that region.

P/B was used to assess population variation under different environmental conditions, while ZB:PB provided information on the zooplankton grazing intensity on algae. Seasonal changes, displayed by the hydrological regime, i.e., related water level fluctuation, were expected to explain different plankton patterns between the study sites as a result of unlike community composition and food quality. The structural equation modelling we used identified specific pathways of measured indexes at the individual localities. Although the direct impact of water level fluctuation on the studied communities was low, the following difference in abiotic components might have caused shifts in zooplankton assemblages that changed P/B and ZB:PB ratios. In the floodplain lake, P/B was primarily influenced by biotic components, and herbivory alteration was expressed through top-down control. On the contrary, P/B in the riverine system was controlled by an environmental element and herbivory was driven by the bottom-up resources. The results show the usefulness of the studied indexes in determining variations of zooplankton functional processes in the hydrologically dynamic environments.					; Galir, Anita/I-9678-2019	Katanic, Natasa/0000-0003-2004-525X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2019	836	1					185	196		10.1007/s10750-019-3950-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-3950-7													WOS:000468991500013

Assessing the utility of sulfur isotope values for understanding mercury concentrations in water and biota from high Arctic lakes	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Methylmercury (MeHg) biomagnifies through aquatic food webs resulting in elevated concentrations in fish globally. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes are frequently used to determine dietary sources of MeHg and to model its biomagnification. However, given the strong links between MeHg and sulfur cycling, we investigated whether sulfur isotopes (delta S-34) would improve our understanding of MeHg concentrations ([MeHg]) in Arctic lacustrine food webs. Delta S-34 values and total mercury (THg) or MeHg were measured in water, sediments, and biota from six lakes near Resolute Bay, NU, Canada. In two lakes impacted by historical eutrophication, aqueous sulfate delta S-34 was similar to 8 parts per thousand more positive than sedimentary delta S-34, suggestive of bacterial sulfate reduction in the sediment. In addition, aqueous delta S-34 showed a significant positive relationship with lakes. Within taxa across lakes, [THg] in Arctic char muscle and [MeHg] in their main prey, chironomids, were positively related to their delta S-34 values across lakes, but inconsistent relationships were found across entire food webs among lakes. Across lakes, nitrogen isotopes were better predictors of biotic [THg] and [MeHg] than delta S-34 within this dataset.

J	Mieczan, T; Rudyk-Leuska, N				Mieczan, Tomasz; Rudyk-Leuska, Natalia			Seasonal dynamics of the epibiont food web on Unio tumidus (Philipsson, 1788) in a eutrophic reservoir	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY												Bivalves represent one of the most important components of freshwater zoobenthos, and their shells provide a substrate for many organisms to create epibiotic communities of predominantly facultative nature. Thus far, information regarding colonization of Unio tumidus by microorganism assemblages has been almost absent. Moreover, data on the functioning of trophic networks created by epibionts are also unavailable. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the assemblage of epibiotic microorganisms inhabiting live and dead bivalves with regard to the physicochemical properties of the habitat and determine whether stable isotope levels in primary producers and consumers colonizing bivalve shells exhibit significant seasonal variability. The substrate characteristic and physicochemical properties of water - primarily biogenic compounds and total organic carbon clearly modified the taxonomic composition of microorganisms and the function of the trophic network. This was reflected by the increased diversity of microorganisms (phycoflora, ciliates and rotifers) on live bivalves and the increase in their abundance on dead bivalves. The level of stable isotopes exhibited clear seasonal variability in individual components of the epibiotic trophic network, whereas food preferences of the potential consumers (protozoans and rotifers) depended significantly on the availability and abundance of food.

J	Bettoli, PW; Scholten, GD				Bettoli, PW; Scholten, GD			Bycatch rates and initial mortality of paddlefish in a commercial gillnet fishery	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Tennessee is one of seven states in the U.S. that allows commercial fishing for paddlefish, Polyodon spathula. Although there is a small market for the flesh, most fishers target paddlefish for their valuable roe, which currently brings as much as US$143/kg wholesale. We deployed experimental monofilament and multifilament gillnets in Kentucky Lake, Tennessee-Kentucky, and accompanied commercial gillnet fishers during the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 commercial fishing seasons (November 15 to April 23) to estimate the bycatch of sublegal (<864 mm eye-fork length) paddlefish, legal males, and legal, but immature, females. Variation in initial mortality (i.e., dead in the nets) was modeled as a function of mesh size, fish length, water temperature, soak time, and twine type using multiple logistic regression. The bycatch rate of sublegal fish in the commercial catch was 60%. Mature females represented only 8% of the catch; thus, the bycatch rate was 92% for fishers targeting egg-laden fish. Most (71%) of the paddlefish were dead in the nets when water temperatures exceeded 17 degrees C. Mesh size and fish length were not significant (P >= 0.098) predictors of initial mortality. The probability of initial mortality was significantly (P >= 0.004) and directly related to soak time and water temperature and fish were more likely to be dead in monofilament nets than multifilament nets. The results of this research prompted the state regulatory authority to end the commercial season 8 days sooner (on April 15 each year) to avoid warm water temperatures; however, a proposed ban on monofilament netting met with stiff opposition from commercial fishing interests and the ban was not enacted.

How the flood shapes aquatic community diversity in highland floodplains is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to unravel the multi-faceted responses of benthic macroinvertebrate diversity to flooding and habitat environments in the Baihe River Basin from a taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional perspective. We examined the alpha and beta diversity patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the mainstream, tributaries, and oxbow lakes during the normal water and flood periods. The results showed that the traditional alpha taxonomic diversity (TD) varied across habitats, despite minor changes after flood pulse. Alpha phylogenetic diversity (PD) decreased and alpha functional diversity (FD) markedly increased after flooding, with functional traits transiting toward risk avoidance. While all the three facets of beta diversity significantly responded to habitat differences, beta TD and PD shifted in response to flooding. Species turnover prominently increased in beta TD and PD after flood pulse, which contrasted with a weaker response of this process in FD. The explanatory power of significant environmental factors on both alpha and beta diversity was reduced by flooding. Compared with traditional TD, cooperating multi-faceted diversity could better depict the responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to flooding. The assessment and conservation of aquatic biodiversity in highland floodplains should take into account the three facets of alpha and beta diversity.						hou, yiming/0000-0003-0854-1162													0013-9351	1096-0953				JUN 1	2024	250								118475	10.1016/j.envres.2024.118475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.118475		FEB 2024						38373546					WOS:001199139600001

To quantify this effect, we measured CO2 effluxes from a mountainous valley-type reservoir in the upper Mekong River (known as Lancang River in China). CO2 evasion rates from the reservoir surface were 408 +/- 337 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in the dry season and 305 +/- 262 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season much lower than those from the riverine channels (1567 +/- 2312 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at the main stem and 905 +/- 1536 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at the tributary). Low effluxes in the pelagic area were caused by low allochthonous organic carbon (OC) inputs and photosynthetic uptake of CO2. A negative relationship between CO2 efflux and water temperature suggested CO2 emissions at the pelagic area were partly offset by photosynthesis in the warmer rainy season. CO2 emissions from the reservoir outlet and littoral area, which were usually considered hotspots of CO2 emissions, had a low contribution to the total emission because of epilimnion water spilling and a small area of the littoral zones. Yet at the river inlets effluxes were much higher in the dry season than in the rainy season because different mixing modes occurred in the two seasons. When the river joined the receiving water-body in the dry season, warmer and lighter inflow became an overflow and large amounts of CO2 were released to the atmosphere as the overflow contacted the atmosphere directly. Extended water retention time due to water storage might also help mineralization of OC. In the wet season, however, colder, turbid and heavier inflow plunged into the reservoir and was discharged downstream for hydroelectricity, leaving insufficient time for decomposition of OC. Besides, diurnal efflux variability indicated that the effluxes were significantly higher in the nighttime than in the daytime, which increased the estimated annual emission rate by half.

Seasonally Accumulation of Microcystins in the Various Tissues of an Endemic and Protected Fish Species (Rutilus panosi) with Different Sizes	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The present study was undertaken to investigate the accumulation of microcystins (MCYST) in the various tissues of an endemic and protected fish species (Rutilus panosi). We also tried to identify any differences in sensitivity and accumulation of MCYST, for various specimens of the same fish species related to body length. MCYST concentrations in lake water and fish tissues were determined by a commercial Microcystin ELISA kit. Results showed that considerable amount of toxins were found to be accumulated in tissues of R. panosi throughout the year. Among them, liver had the highest MCYST concentrations (407.97?+/-?32.43?ng/g). This study confirmed the accumulation of high MCYST concentrations in fish brain (308.75?+/-?26.49?ng/g). Our results suggest, that MCYST accumulation in R. panosi tissues is size depended. High MCYST concentration in the muscle of the fish increases the risk of unsafe consumption, thus threatening human health.

Life history strategy and population characteristics of an unexploited riverine cyprinid, Labeo capensis, in the largest impoundment in the Orange River Basin	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												The life history of an endemic riverine African cyprinid, Labeo capensis, that dominates the larger ichthyofauna in a large impoundment in the Orange River Basin four decades after damming, was investigated. Both sexes grew at a similar rate until the onset of maturation, after which male growth and survival rates declined. Male mortality rate was significantly higher than estimated for females explaining both the older ages attained by females (12 years) compared to males (9 years) and a female-dominated adult population. Maturation proceeded faster in males than in females, but was considerably delayed in both age and length. Female reproductive contribution was double that of males despite males maturing a year earlier. Intraspecific life history comparisons with riverine and early impoundment populations suggest that L. capensis has largely maintained its riverine life history characteristics. These characteristics are common in large fishes that are well-adapted to seasonal riverine environments, but often show high vulnerability to damming or overfishing. The absence of a directed fishery and the availability of periodic floodplains that form when marginal vegetation is inundated by either the unregulated inflow of the Orange River or local erratic rains is suggested to have played a vital role for the successful establishment of L. capensis within the impoundment.					; Booth, Anthony/C-9932-2012	Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Booth, Anthony/0000-0002-5561-9260													1562-7020	2224-073X				APR	2012	47	1					85	99		10.3377/004.047.0124	http://dx.doi.org/10.3377/004.047.0124													WOS:000308773900011
J	Xu, YY; Cai, QH; Shao, ML; Han, XQ				Xu, Yaoyang; Cai, Qinghua; Shao, Meiling; Han, Xinqin			Patterns of asynchrony for phytoplankton fluctuations from reservoir mainstream to a tributary bay in a giant dendritic reservoir (Three Gorges Reservoir, China)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Seasonal fluctuations of phytoplankton have often been regarded as one of the important cyclic events in aquatic ecosystems, and have even been emphasized as an important sign of regional climatic variability in limnology. However, few attempts have been made to examine synchrony for phytoplankton fluctuations among different habitats in a single reservoir system. The present study employed Spearman rank correlation analysis and the Mantel test to assess levels of synchrony for phytoplankton abundance and taxonomic composition from reservoir mainstream to a tributary bay (Xiangxi Bay) in a giant dendritic reservoir, China (Three Gorges Reservoir, TGR). At the selected scale, asynchronous patterns of phytoplankton were found when looking at total abundance and taxonomic composition, suggesting that regional drivers were not strong enough to synchronize phytoplankton fluctuations, and local regulators were predominant. As a riverine system, the mainstream of TGR had high levels of algal synchrony, while asynchronous patterns of phytoplankton were detected within Xiangxi Bay, which is characterized as a lacustrine system. The present study further confirmed that external hydrological disturbances strongly homogenize habitat conditions and synchronize phytoplankton fluctuations within the mainstream, while spatial divergence of phytoplankton succession depend on local habitat conditions within Xiangxi Bay. Moreover, low synchrony of phytoplankton between the mainstream and Xiangxi Bay is probably caused by spatial divergence of phytoplankton succession within Xiangxi Bay and the lack of succession in the rapidly flushed mainstream. Independently of these mechanisms possibly explaining phytoplankton fluctuations, the present study has also an applied perspective to the improvement of a long-term observation program in which phytoplankton trends at the mainstream scale could be compiled from the data set in a single site, while a set of sampling sites should be required at the Xiangxi Bay scale.

Physicochemical characteristics of water were evaluated in the lakewater. Fish were sampled on seasonal basis, and liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, plasma lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were assayed. Plasma vitellogenin level and hepatosomatic index and condition factors were also determined. Strong seasonal variations were observed but there were no gender differences among selected markers. The highest vitellogenin level of male fish was detected as 606 ng/mL which represents the estrogenicity of water in the lake in September 2005. In addition, the seasonal changes of some biomarkers such as EROD and AChE showed that the lake may be at risk of pollution by some xenobiotics arising from agricultural and/or industrial activities.

Distribution and abundance of phytoplankton: influence of salinity and turbidity gradients in the Na Thap River, Songkhla Province, Thailand. Journal of Coastal Research, 27(3), 585-594. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Distributions of phytoplankton density and their relationships to physicochemical variables were investigated using multivariate analyses, based on data collected every two months from a tropical, inland, freshwater estuary in southern Thailand between June 2005 and December 2007. Results indicated 74 genera of phytoplankton in the samples. More than 75% of the genera were diatoms (30 genera; 40.5%) and chlorophytes (29 genera; 39.2%), and 20% were cyanobacteria (6 genera; 8.1%) and dinoflagellates (6 genera; 8.1%). Variations in phytoplankton density largely resulted from salinity and turbidity, which varied seasonally and geographically. Chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, and euglenophytes were the most common groups in the turbid freshwater habitat, whereas diatoms and dinoflagellates dominated along the salinity gradient of the clear estuarine environment. Our results suggest that the Na Thap River has been regulated mainly by the natural phenomena of marine and riverine influences, even though the river is situated on agricultural, aquacultural, and industrial land. Continued observations of phytoplankton density and composition are needed, emphasizing any unusual increases in density and/or the unexpected presence of harmful species. The long-term trends of phytoplankton provide an indication of the change in the trophic status of the basin, as well as a foundation for further studies of the distributions of upper-level aquatic species in freshwater estuarine ecosystems.					; Wongsai, Sangdao/AAU-9683-2021	Wongsai, Sangdao/0000-0001-8026-146X; 													0749-0208	1551-5036				MAY	2011	27	3					585	594		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00123.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00123.1													WOS:000290645600018

In recent years, significant cyanobacterial blooms have occurred in this lake nearly every year because of eutrophication. Monitoring data for the past 5 years acquired by our research group showed that phytoplankton composition alternated between species of Microcystis sp. during warm seasons and those of Aphanizomenon sp. during cool seasons. In March 2003, when phytoplankton composition was highly dominated by Aphanizomenon sp., samples were taken from the lake for toxin detection and immediate strain isolation. A mouse bioassay with extracts from the lyophilized field material showed obvious intoxication from paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs), and all mice died within 30 min. Further analysis of both field and isolated algal strain Aphanizomenon DC-1 by the postcolumn HPLC-FLD method confirmed its PSP-producing ability The analogues found in the extracts from the field material were neoSTX, dcSTX, and dcGTX3, with contents of 2.279, 1.135, and 0.547 ng/mg DW, respectively. Under laboratory culture condition, toxin content in the Aphanizomenon strain DC-1 varied greatly during different growth phases, with two peaks: in the early-exponential and late-stationary growth phases. When the culture grew at a relatively high rate during the mid- to late-exponential growth phase, toxin content declined gradually. Moreover, the types of toxin in the DC-1 strain varied greatly during a single culture cycle. The HPLC results showed that dcSTX was the only toxin isomer detected throughout the culture period, and its level remained stable. On the other hand, dcGTX2 and GTX4 were the major toxins during the early-exponential and stationary phases, respectively. This article presents the first data on the identification and detection of paralytic shellfish toxins from cyanobacteria in Lake Dianchi. As far as we know, this is also the first report of this type of toxin in inland water bodies in China. Our study indicates the threat associated with PSP toxins in Lake Dianchi and suggests that necessary measures and programs for control are urgently needed to prevent the spread of toxic cyanobacterial blooms.

Coastal dynamics on a soft coastline from serendipitous webcams: KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Webcams have become popular means of showcasing beach conditions for a wide variety of beach users. However, webcams can also be a useful tool in assessing changes in coastal morphology and coastal processes. This information can be used by managers to assist in planning. A number of fixed-position beach webcams are freely available to the South African public via various tourism, surfing, weather and aviation websites, individual clubs and a cell-phone network provider. The advantages of these public networks are that the information is free and as the webcams are fixed, afford a consistent and comparable view of the beach. The disadvantage is that you are at the mercy of the provider: resolution is generally poor, downtime and communication are out of your control, and you have no influence over the positioning of the webcam or the discontinuity of service. Notwithstanding the above, the existing webcams can still provide valuable information. From the network of beach webcams available in South Africa we analyse imagery from three beach webcams located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, at Umhlanga, Margate beach and lagoon, and Amanzimtoti beach and lagoon to examine the coastal dynamics. From these case studies we illustrate seasonal beach rotation and lagoon mouth dynamics, specifically why outlets migrate southwards in opposition to regional longshore drift. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Water level in Lakes Pata and Verde, Brazil, is determined by the ratio of precipitation:leakage. Times of low lake level are indicated in sediments by oxidized clays, evidence of algal blooms and high K+ concentrations. Peak K+ values are attributed to biogenic concentration when the lake was reduced to a shallow, productive pool. Low lake phases correlate with maximum insolation during the dry season (June-July-August). Thus the last glacial maximum 18,000 to 22,000 yr BP was a wet time in northern Amazonia, and the driest period of the last 170,000 years was from 35,000 to 27,000 yr BP. These results from near the equator do not imply that precipitation changed synchronously across Amazonia, because geographic locations throughout the vast watershed were undoubtedly influenced by local moisture sources.

J	Burkins, MB; Virginia, RA; Wall, DH				Burkins, MB; Virginia, RA; Wall, DH			Organic carbon cycling in Taylor Valley, Antarctica: quantifying soil reservoirs and soil respiration	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Organic carbon reservoirs and respiration rates in soils have been calculated for most major biomes on Earth revealing patterns related to temperature, precipitation, and location. Yet data from one of the Earth's coldest, driest, and most southerly soil ecosystems, that of the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, are currently not a part of this global database. In this paper, we present the first regional calculations of the sail organic carbon reservoirs in a dry valley ecosystem (Taylor Valley) and report measurements of CO2 efflux from Antarctic soils. Our analyses indicate that, despite the absence of visible accumulations of organic matter in most of Taylor Valley's arid soils, this soil environment contained a significant percentage (up to 72%) of the seasonally unfrozen organic carbon reservoir in the terrestrial ecosystem. Field measurements of soil CO2-efflux in Taylor Valley soils were used to evaluate biotic respiration and averaged 0.10 +/- 0.08 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Laboratory soil microcosms suggested that this respiration rate was sensitive to increases in temperature, moisture, and carbon addition. Finally, a steady-state calculation of the mean residence time for organic carbon in Taylor Valley soils was 23 years. because this value contradicts all that is currently known about carbon cycling rates in the dry valleys, we suggest that the dry valley soil carbon dynamics is not steady state. Instead, we suggest that the dynamic is complex, with at least two (short- and la,ng-term) organic carbon reservoirs. We also suggest that organic carbon in the dry valley soil environment may be more important, and play a more active role in long-term ecosystem processes, than previously believed.

This microseismicity is shallow, mainly triggered in swarms and characterized by repeating earthquakes. Four recurrent families of Volcano -Tectonic (VT) repeaters have been identified and the main repeater accounts for 80% of detections. Stacking repeating seismic waveforms produces MASTER events with a high Signal -to -Noise Ratio (SNR) and thanks to the deployment of a temporary seismic nodal array, their absolute locations can be better constrained. Because we observe systematic positive residuals of P -wave arrival times at almost all stations, we investigate potential bias in the velocity model in the shallow part of the dome. By increasing the P -wave velocity and decreasing the VP/VS ratio from 1.8 to 1.69, we reduce these residuals and improve the local velocity model. We use this new velocity model to locate each VT event relatively to is own MASTER hypocenter. This procedure offers a new image of the hydrothermal seismic activity that we locate under the acid lake of the summit Tarissan crater, along a sub -vertical conduit. We also define a linear relationship between the logarithm of the peak amplitude of seismic events and their duration to obtain a pseudo local magnitude. The approach enables to accurately and automatically estimate the magnitude during the event detection. We show that after the occurrence in April 2018 of the largest earthquake (Mlv 4.1) since the last phreatic eruption in 1976-1977, the swarm frequency and amplitude increased significantly, and a new family of VT repeater emerges, accounting for up to 14% of detections. We show a quiescence in the main repeaters activity in the month following the April 2018 earthquake, suggesting a significant stress release within the volcanic system, which is likely related to dynamic stress changes rather than static stress variations caused by the earthquake. Moreover, we detect the emergence of a new family of repeaters 3 months after the event, located similar to 100 m above the main repeater family, that could be related to a fluid pressure increase induced by the regional hydrological cycle, superimposed to the internal forcing driven by the hydrothermal system. Finally, using a statistical approach, we highlight seasonal periodicities in the number of events and the released seismic moment at La Soufrie`re de Guadeloupe, with a dominant peak of seismic activity in October-November and a second, less significant, peak of in April.					; Chanard, Kristel/AAB-7677-2019; Burtin, Arnaud/AGE-4823-2022; Komorowski, Jean-Christophe/W-2158-2019	Burtin, Arnaud/0009-0001-7046-1561; Pantobe, Laetitia/0000-0002-4386-6977; 													0377-0273	1872-6097				MAR	2024	447								107989	10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2023.107989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2023.107989		FEB 2024											WOS:001199335400001
J	Akitomo, K; Tanaka, K; Kumagai, M				Akitomo, Kazunori; Tanaka, Kiyoshi; Kumagai, Michio			Annual cycle of circulations in Lake Biwa, part 2: mechanisms	LIMNOLOGY												We investigate the mechanisms of circulations in Lake Biwa using model results that are driven by the momentum and heat fluxes evaluated from meteorological parameters observed around and on the lake. The kinetic energy budget shows that the wind stress over the lake, which has positive (negative) curl over the northern (southern) region of the lake throughout the year, generates the current system of multiple gyres in the stratified season (May-January), while the thermal forcing makes a minor contribution. This mechanism is quite different from the previous picture, in which the thermal forcing was dominant in forming the gyre system during the heating season. In the cooling season, the overturning of the lake occurs not in a simple one-dimensional (vertical) process, but in a time-dependent three-dimensional one. Cold water that is formed in the shallow eastern region descends the bottom slope to the deep lake in December to March while such a descent hardly occurs in the western region. A large shallow area (small heat capacity) as well as intense cooling in the eastern region effectively produces cold water. Wind again plays an important role by intensifying the cooling through its higher speed and by driving slope current. Further, the fluctuating wind direction causes significantly time-dependent behaviors of the slope current or bottom water formation.																			1439-8621					AUG	2009	10	2					119	129		10.1007/s10201-009-0268-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0268-6													WOS:000268017800005

Mating system variability in a mouthbrooding cichlid fish from a tropical lake	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Intraspecific variability in mating behaviour and disparities between social and reproductive behaviour add complexity to the description of animal mating systems. A previously published field study on a population of the maternally mouthbrooding cichlid fish Ctenochromis horei in the north of Lake Tanganyika suggested mate monopolization by the most dominant male. In the present study, genetic reconstructions of paternity in a population in the south of the lake provided no evidence for male mate monopolization, as none of the inferred sires had offspring in more than one brood. The ability to reconstruct sire genotypes from offspring alleles was confirmed by computer simulations. Multiple paternity occurred in several broods and was significantly more frequent in the sample taken in the rainy season than in the dry season sample (100% of broods vs. 14%, respectively; P = 0.005). The data suggest geographical and temporal variation in the mating behaviour of C. horei despite its continuous year-round reproduction, invariable brood care behaviour and habitat-specific distribution in the relatively constant and confined environment of a tropical lake. Moreover, our data show that inferences on the distribution of male reproductive success, if based on each geographical or temporal data set alone, would fail to describe the potential for sexual selection in this species.					; Koblmüller, Stephan/AFI-3908-2022	Sefc, Kristina/0000-0001-8108-8339; Koblmuller, Stephan/0000-0002-1024-3220													0962-1083					AUG	2009	18	16					3508	3517		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04295.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04295.x								19659476					WOS:000268760100015

A lacustrine carbonate record of Holocene seasonality and climate	GEOLOGY												Annually laminated (varved) Holocene sediments from Derby Lake, Michigan, display variations in endogenic calcite abundance reflecting a long-term (millennial-scale) decrease in burial punctuated with frequent short-term (decadal-scale) oscillations due to carbonate dissolution. Since 6000 cal yr B. P., sediment carbonate abundance has followed a decreasing trend while organic-carbon abundance has increased. The correlation between organic-carbon abundance and the sum of March-April-October-November insolation has an r(2) value of 0.58. We interpret these trends to represent a precession-driven lengthening of the Holocene growing season that has reduced calcite burial by enhancing net annual organic-matter production and associated calcite dissolution. Correlations with regional paleoclimate records suggest that changes in temperature and moisture balance have impacted the distribution of short-term oscillations in carbonate and organic-matter abundance superimposed on the precession-driven trends.

The concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were 0.8-1.6 and 7.0-10 ng/L in northern basin of Lake Biwa (eight sites), 0.9-1.7 and 8.3-13 ng/L in southern basin of Lake Biwa except Akanoi Bay (four sites), 1.4-2.8 and 9.1-17 ng/L in Akanoi Bay (8C) and 2.4-5.3 and 12-26 ng/L in Akanoi Bay (168), respectively. Seasonal changes were recognized for both of PFOS and PFOA in the two sites of Akanoi Bay but not in the other sites of the southern and northern basins of Lake Biwa. Monthly detailed surveys in the surface water were performed on the changes of PFOS and PFOA concentrations from June in 2009 to May in 2010 and further on the changes of conductivity values. The changes of PFOS and PFOA concentrations were well consistent with those of conductivity values.																			0007-4861	1432-0800				DEC	2010	85	6					593	597		10.1007/s00128-010-0116-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-010-0116-8								20927624					WOS:000285743200010
J	Borza, P				Borza, Peter			Life history of invasive Ponto-Caspian mysids (Crustacea: Mysida): A comparative study	LIMNOLOGICA												In recent decades the Ponto-Caspian mysids Limnomysis benedeni, Hemimysis anomala, and Katamysis warpachowskyi expanded their ranges throughout the North Atlantic region and proved to have profound ecological impacts in the invaded waters. The aim of this study was to (1) provide a comprehensive description about the life history of the previously least known K. warpachowskyi, (2) reveal the number of generations produced annually by the three invasive Ponto-Caspian mysids, and to (3) compare the life history traits of the three species directly for the first time based on a simultaneous sampling. To obtain a high-resolution picture about their body length-frequency distributions, a very intensive (approximately weekly) sampling was carried out in an artificial embayment of the Danube River (in Hungary), where the three species coexist. The relatively large L. benedeni had five generations per year and produced comparatively low numbers of young, while the similar sized H. anomala completed only four generations, but compensated for this with a higher fecundity. The smaller sized K. warpachowskyi was able to produce more than five (probably 6) generations per year owing to its short maturation time and long reproductive season, and attained brood sizes close to those of L. benedeni. The generation numbers revealed by the study can be regarded as extraordinarily high considering the body size of the animals and the temperate climatic conditions, which might contribute to their invasion success by increasing the chance of establishment, especially in the course of jump dispersal events at which Ponto-Caspian mysids have proved very successful.

We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates at monthly intervals and surveyed the vegetation dynamics every 2 months from May 2009 to October 2010. We determined the colonization rate using the newly adopted colonization index (CI), and evaluated the colonization pattern using multivariate analyses, including nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and indicator species analysis (ISPAN). As predicted, the species richness and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates increased markedly in early successional phases in the 2 created wetlands, and initial planting accelerated colonization of benthic macroinvertebrate communities; in comparison, the older man-made wetland showed a more gradual increase. The CI (range 100-0) decreased over time in the created wetlands; this decrease was more rapid in the planted wetland than in the non-planted wetland. After 400 Julian days, the benthic macroinvertebrate community in the planted wetland showed 90% similarity with that in the older man-made wetland. The NMS results revealed that the colonization pattern of benthic macroinvertebrates differed significantly according to vegetation (non-planted versus planted [p = 0.000]), season (p = 0.001), and year (p = 0.014). The ISPAN results showed that the indicator species in the non-planted and planted wetlands were the burrowing mayfly (Ephemera orientalis) and the damselfly (Ischnura asiatica), respectively. Our findings demonstrate the validity of using the CI to quantify the colonization rate of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in typical small-sized temperate wetlands.

J	Lapointe, NWR				Lapointe, Nicolas W. R.			Effects of shoreline type, riparian zone and instream microhabitat on fish species richness and abundance in the Detroit River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Widespread development of shorelines has contributed to habitat loss and degradation, affecting aquatic taxa across a wide range of systems. The nearshore zone offers unique fish habitat, with terrestrial systems providing structure, cover and organic matter. My objective in this study was to examine relationships between shoreline types and fishes in the Detroit River, a large Laurentian Great Lakes connecting channel. I tested the hypothesis that fish species richness and abundance differed with shoreline and riparian zone type and explored the relative importance of instream microhabitat on these relationships. Fishes were sampled in three seasons using two sampling methods, and instream microhabitats were quantified at each sampling location. No differences were observed in fish species richness or abundance among riparian zone or shoreline types, though comparisons between developed and natural shorelines were constrained by a small number of samples at natural shorelines. The lack of differences among shoreline and riparian zone types was consistent across seasons and between sampling methods. Instream microhabitat explained the greatest variation in fish species richness and abundance, and only minor variation was explained jointly by microhabitat and shoreline type. Though local effects of shoreline development were not observed, widespread shoreline development may affect Detroit River fishes at the ecosystem scale, and future mechanistic studies of the ecological changes accompanying shoreline development are warranted. The importance of instream microhabitat variables demonstrates that shoreline restoration projects involving improvements to instream habitat, in addition to altering the shoreline itself, will provide the greatest benefits to large-river fishes.

Selective predation is recognized to be the ultimate cause of such a strong impact. Here we describe the selection of zooplankton prey by analyzing the stomach contents of more than 300 brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) inhabiting seven alpine lakes in the Gran Paradiso National Park (western Italian Alps). Our results show that planktivory is much more common in young fish, which feed on a larger number of taxa, but also adult fish maintain the ability to feed on zooplankton. There is a direct dependence between the length of zooplankton prey and the length of their fish predators, and adult, not juvenile fish are responsible of the selective predation on large crustacean zooplankton, which drive the impact of introduced fish throughout the entire zooplankton community. In some rare cases, large zooplankton populations develop in the presence of brook trout, and planktivory can become an important temporary resource for adult fish during the ice-free season. Thus, in the early stages of the establishment of non-native trout in alpine lakes, large-bodied zooplankton may represent an important food resource.

Regional differences in the reproductive parameters of the sparsely-spotted stingaree, Urolophus paucimaculatus, from south-eastern Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Whether spatial variation occurs in the life-history traits of chondrichthyan species is important to fisheries modelling and assessments. A study on the reproductive parameters of Urolophus paucimaculatus from four separate regions across south-eastern Australia found regional differences in maximum total length (TL), size-at-maturity, size-at-maternity and litter sizes. Inshore embayments (Port Phillip Bay (PPB) and Corner Inlet (CI)) appear to allow for larger TLs (females and males) than do offshore areas (Lakes Entrance (LE) and Western Bass Strait (WBS)). Size-at-maturity and size-at-maternity decreased across longitude from west (PPB) to east (LE) and seasonality of parturition and ovulation occurred earlier in PPB (August-October) than in LE (September-December). Maximum litter size correlated with maximum TL (six in PPB, five in each of CI and LE, and four in WBS). There was uncertainty in classifying females for maternal condition because the reproductive cycle appears to range from a continuous annual cycle to a non-continuous biennial cycle. Much of the uncertainty arises from the ambiguity of observation of non-pregnant mature females, which have either aborted through capture and handling, or are in a 'resting year' between pregnancies. Most likely, the majority are reproducing annually with an unknown proportion of females non-continuous and resting between pregnancies.

Diet overlap between the newly introduced Lamprichthys tanganicanus and the Tanganyika sardine in Lake Kivu, Eastern Africa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study evaluates the possible competition for food between Lamprichthys tanganicanus, recently introduced in Lake Kivu, and Limnothrissa miodon, which has been the basis of the pelagic fishery in this lake for several decades. Since 2006, L. tanganicanus has expanded in the lake and its numbers have increased in the captures, raising concern for the sardine fishery. We carried out a 2-year monthly survey, based on experimental captures in littoral and pelagic stations, which demonstrated the invasive dispersal of L. tanganicanus in littoral and pelagic waters. The diet of both species was determined on the basis of gut content analyses, taking into account the influence of site and season, and a diet overlap index was calculated. In the pelagic zone, where almost all size classes of both species were present and essentially fed upon mesozooplankton, the diet overlap was high. This situation stems from the fact that L. tanganicanus has colonized the pelagic zone in Lake Kivu, likely in search for more abundant mesozooplankton. Inshore, the diet overlap between the two species was lower, as L. tanganicanus consumed a broad range of food, whereas L. miodon strongly selected insects and, chiefly for the largest specimens, fishes. These results suggest a likelihood of interspecific competition, particularly offshore, where mesozooplankton is the main available food type, and call for further monitoring of the sardine fishery, to assess a possible impact of the invader.

Using a randomized complete block design, two trials were conducted at commercial vineyards in the Finger Lakes Region of New York during 2004 to 2005. Black and white geotextiles in 2-m-wide or 5-m-wide strips almost doubled vine size after two years, but did not affect overwinter primary bud survival compared with mowed sod row middles with undervine herbicide control treatment. In both experiments, the white geotextile mulch significantly increased sunlight reflected from the vineyard floor into the vine cluster zone, especially early in the growing season. Vines mulched with white geotextile had greater yields, but there were no significant differences in fruit ripening time or fruit chemical composition at harvest, and minimal differences in vine nutrient status among the floor management systems. The increased yield values in reflective geotextile plots were not sufficient to compensate for the substantially greater costs of geotextiles relative to the standard practices of mowed sod row middles with undervine herbicide weed control.

The analysis is based on calculations with the FLEXTRA trajectory model and the FLEXPART tracer model and data from Measurements of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In-Service Aircraft (MOZAIC) flights and North American surface sites. Lidar measurements carried out under conditions of developing anticyclonicity at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, consistently yield peak ozone mixing ratios in the middle and upper troposphere between 80 and 110 ppb during the warm season. These layers are traced back to North America by FLEXTRA trajectories. The prevailing transport pathway involves a warm conveyor belt exporting high amounts of ozone, formed during a prefrontal high-ozone episode, from the central part of the eastern United States to the upper troposphere. The polluted air may enter central Europe above an airstream descending from the stratosphere, thus inverting the normal atmospheric stratification, with stratospheric air at low levels and boundary layer air in the upper troposphere. However, the first two cases studied in this paper show that the export from the eastern United States may arrive over Europe at times prior to the onset of the anticyclonic conditions. Analysis of these cases reveals the complexity of the air export from North America. The ozone maxima occurring during the observational periods are traced back to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in other source areas in the United States. Some of them are related to entrainments even from source areas beyond North America, either in the stratosphere or in Asia. The third case is quite different in its advection pathway, with almost straight and horizontal advection at 6 to 8 km above sea level starting from the Great Lakes area. A positive correlation between ozone and aerosol in that layer verifies the presence of PBL air. However, the very high ozone mixing ratio ( up to 130 ppb) and an anticorrelation of ozone and humidity suggest the entrainment of another component from long-range transport in the upper troposphere from beyond North America. In two of the case studies the export from the PBL was presumably influenced by large-scale convection.

The strong daily sea breeze was found to generate a vertical mode 1 internal Kelvin wave and basin-scale internal Poincare waves of vertical modes 1, 2, and 3. The Kelvin wave, the dominant component of the internal wave field, was responsible for alongshore velocities in the nearshore regions. In the upwind nearshore regions, velocities were dominated by the forced response to the wind and were cross shore in nature. In the lake interior, the Kelvin wave effect on the horizontal velocity field was minor compared to the higher vertical mode Poincare waves. The Kelvin wave is shown to exist in resonant and nonforced states with the wind, whereas the vertical mode 1 Poincare wave energy remained relatively constant, despite large variability in the forcing conditions. The energy in the higher mode Poincare waves varied greatly, both on daily and seasonal timescales. The results demonstrate that the wind energy forces multiple basin-scale internal wave modes and that prior motion in the water column must be considered when determining the subsequent internal wave response in periodically forced systems.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2000	45	7					1621	1638		10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1621	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1621													WOS:000165267100015

Whereas most green algae developed better in the rainy season and in the northern part of the lake, Eremosphaera developed better in the southern basin, in the dry season. It also exhibited large variations in cell abundance and cell size, with maxima in the middle of the dry season, which may be related to increased phosphorus availability. Moreover, increase in cell size (up to 80 mu m in length), without notable change in S/V ratio, may provide the alga with resistance to grazing by copepods, which reach maximal abundance during the dry season.					; Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya/F-4549-2018	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya/0000-0003-2439-3737													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2007	578	1					7	16		10.1007/s10750-006-0428-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0428-1													WOS:000244308300002

Log partial pressure versus 1/T plots for gamma -HCH, dieldrin, chlordanes, and their metabolites showed significant relationships, whereas those for toxaphene, heptachlor, and p,p'-DDE did not. The chromatographic profile of toxaphene congeners in air and soil showed depletion of certain labile congeners, notably B8-531 and B8-806/809; other persistent congeners (B8-1412 and B9-1679) were enriched in air samples. Concentrations of toxaphene in Alabama air were 6-40 times higher than in the Great Lakes region, and chlordane in Alabama air exceeded Great Lakes concentrations by 3-9-fold. This suggests that transport from the southern U.S. is a continuing source of toxaphene and chlordane to the Great Lakes; Levels of HCHs and dieldrin in Alabama were similar to those in the Great Lakes region. Patterns of 8-chlorinated bornanes in air more closely resemble residues in soil than the technical toxaphene standard. Enantiomer ratios of chlordanes in air were nearly racemic, indicating that their source is probably evaporation from termiticide usage rather than from soils, which contain nonracemic chlordanes.

The interaction between surface water and groundwater, along with solute transport at the sediment -water interface (SWI), plays a crucial role in material cycling within the Poyang Lake ecosystem. However, the mechanisms governing how the relative positions of these lakes influence solute transport at the SWI remain unclear. This study employs indoor experiments and simulations based on real topography to investigate how the separation distance and elevation differences between two seasonal lakes, termed "lake A" (situated farther from the main lake) and "lake B" (closer to the main lake), affect solute transport. Findings highlight a distinct recharge pattern from lake A to lake B and the main lake during periodic water level fluctuations. A reduced distance between dual seasonal lakes results in a diminished water level drop in lake B during dry seasons. Proximity allows lake A to contribute more solutes to the main lake while promoting solute transport from lake B to the main lake, increasing the pore water recharge flux to overlying water in lake B. In cases where the separation distance has insufficient impact on water levels, the speed of pore water flow in this area inversely correlates with the distance between dual lakes. Reducing the distance intensifies solute transport into the bottom of lake A. Lower the elevation of lake B increases the water level difference between dual seasonal lakes, curtailing pollution within the lakebed. Elevating lake B forms hydrological isolation and more severe pollution of the lakebed. Solutes predominantly transport between lake B and the main lake, with pollution spreading to the lakebed of lake A and transitioning to downward diffusion over time. This research provides valuable insights for the hydraulic regulation of seasonal lakes and holds significance for the ecological restoration of Poyang Lake.

Temporal variability in water quality parameters-a case study of drinking water reservoir in Florida, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Our objective was to evaluate changes in water quality parameters during 1983-2007 in a subtropical drinking water reservoir (area: 7 km(2)) located in Lake Manatee Watershed (area: 338 km(2)) in Florida, USA. Most water quality parameters (color, turbidity, Secchi depth, pH, EC, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, cations, anions, and lead) were below the Florida potable water standards. Concentrations of copper exceeded the potable water standard of < 30 mu g l(-1) in about half of the samples. About 75 % of total N in lake was organic N (0.93 mg l(-1)) with the remainder (25 %) as inorganic N (NH3-N: 0.19, NO3-N: 0.17 mg l(-1)), while 86 % of total P was orthophosphate. Mean total N/P was < 6:1 indicating N limitation in the lake. Mean monthly concentration of chlorophyll-a was much lower than the EPA water quality threshold of 20 mu g l(-1). Concentrations of total N showed significant increase from 1983 to 1994 and a decrease from 1997 to 2007. Total P showed significant increase during 1983-2007. Mean concentrations of total N (n = 215; 1.24 mg l(-1)) were lower, and total P (n = 286; 0.26 mg l(-1)) was much higher than the EPA numeric criteria of 1.27 mg total N l(-1) and 0.05 mg total P l(-1) for Florida's colored lakes, respectively. Seasonal trends were observed for many water quality parameters where concentrations were typically elevated during wet months (June-September). Results suggest that reducing transport of organic N may be one potential option to protect water quality in this drinking water reservoir.

Seasonal variability in the concentration and flux of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen in a semiarid catchment, San Pedro River, Arizona	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] Streams and rivers in semiarid environments are characterized by highly variable discharge associated with seasonal precipitation patterns. To characterize how this variability in discharge affects the concentration and flux of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen, we measured discharge and collected water samples in the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona from April 2001 through September 2002. Mean daily discharge during the study ranged from 2.5 x 10(3) m(3) day(-1) to 9.4 x 10(5) m(3) day(-1), with low discharge in late June followed shortly thereafter by the highest discharge in July or early August after the onset of monsoon storms. Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) dominated carbon and nitrogen flux during the nonmonsoon season, while Particulate Organic Matter (POM) dominated flux during the monsoon. The concentrations of Dissolved Organic Carbon and Nitrogen (DOC, DON), and NO3-N typically increased 2- to 10-fold, while POM increased by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude during the monsoon season. Concurrent increases in concentration and discharge resulted in 96% of the annual organic carbon (DOC + POC) and 97% annual nitrogen (DIN + DON + PON) flux occurring during the monsoon season with the majority of both organic carbon (92%) and total nitrogen (83%) being transported as particulates. These data indicate that POM transported during the monsoon season may be a major source of carbon and nitrogen to the stream ecosystem, potentially fueling heterotrophic activity in sediments and the hyporheic zone after the monsoon season and associated floods have ended.

While ecosystem health and integrity assessments have been widely applied, they often focus on ecosystem elements, overlooking their interconnections and dynamic characteristics. Establishing an integrated ecosystem assessment framework is vital to apply a comprehensive perspective in evaluations. In the current paper, a systematic review of aquatic ecosystem assessment methods is done, encompassing health and integrity assessment, network analysis, and stability and regime shift assessment. These approaches consider not only the individual elements but also the complex interconnections and dynamic characteristics within the ecosystem, which have been rarely studied due to limitations in field data availability. A case study of Poyang Lake is further presented for practical demonstration on the specific operation of the combined assessments. The integration of aquatic ecosystem assessment with ecological modeling is strongly advocated because it not only helps overcome the limitations of field data for assessing historical or current conditions, but it also enables prediction of future developments.

J	Pletzer, T; Conway, JP; Cullen, NJ; Eidhammer, T; Katurji, M				Pletzer, Tamara; Conway, Jonathan P.; Cullen, Nicolas J.; Eidhammer, Trude; Katurji, Marwan			The application and modification of WRF-Hydro/Glacier to a cold-based Antarctic glacier	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) are home to a unique microbial ecosystem that is dependent on the availability of freshwater. This is a polar desert and freshwater originates almost entirely from surface and near-surface melt of the cold-based glaciers. Understanding the future evolution of these environments requires the simulation of the full chain of physical processes from net radiative forcing, surface energy balance, melt, runoff and transport of meltwater in stream channels from the glaciers to the terminal lakes where the microbial community resides. To establish a new framework to do this, we present the first application of WRF-Hydro/Glacier in the MDV, which as a fully distributed hydrological model has the capability to resolve the streams from the glaciers to the bare land that surround them. Given that meltwater generation in the MDV is almost entirely dependent on small changes in the energy balance of the glaciers, the aim of this study is to optimize the multi-layer snowpack scheme that is embedded in WRF-Hydro/Glacier to ensure that the feedbacks between albedo, snowfall and melt are fully resolved. To achieve this, WRF-Hydro/Glacier is implemented at a point scale using automatic weather station data on Commonwealth Glacier to physically model the onset, duration and end of melt over a 7-month period (1 August 2021 to 28 February 2022). To resolve the limited energetics controlling melt, it was necessary to (1) limit the percolation of meltwater through the ice layers in the multi-layer snowpack scheme and (2) optimize the parameters controlling the albedo of both snow and ice over the melt season based on observed spectral signatures of albedo. These modifications enabled the variability of broadband albedo over the melt season to be accurately simulated and ensured that modelled surface and near-surface temperatures, surface height change and runoff were fully resolved. By establishing a new framework that couples a detailed snowpack model to a fully distributed hydrological model, this work provides a stepping stone to model the spatial and temporal variability of melt and streamflow in the future, which will enable some of the unknown questions about the hydrological connectivity of the MDV to be answered.					; Conway, Jonathan/NHP-2775-2025	Katurji, Marwan/0000-0002-3368-1469; Pletzer, Tamara/0000-0002-3139-9224; Cullen, Nicolas James/0000-0001-8877-1325; Conway, Jonathan/0000-0001-9276-7425													1027-5606	1607-7938				FEB 7	2024	28	3					459	478		10.5194/hess-28-459-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-459-2024													WOS:001190522500001

This study aims to acquire a better understanding of the status of phytoplankton distribution in Lake Nasser under the current flood regime and before the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Samples were collected from fifteen sites representing different lake sectors along the main channel of the lake during 2016-2017. Approximately 103 species were recorded, belonging to six different classes, dominated by Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, whereas Euglenophyceae, Dinophyceae and Chrysophyceae were rare. Based on the abundance of phytoplankton species, the pre-flood and post-flood seasons were very well discriminated. A major blooming of Cyanobacteria in the Tushka sector was detected during the pre-flood season, whereas this phenomenon diminished in the post-flood period when Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae appeared. The results of this study indicated that the most important factors affecting phytoplankton species distribution during pre-flood and post-flood seasons are temperature, nutrients and total dissolved solids. The study confirms that flood regime substantially affects the phytoplankton abundance and distribution in Lake Nasser.					; ALY, WALID/AAT-9608-2021; Zaher, Shymaa/ABC-8683-2021	Aly, Walid/0000-0002-5961-8214; 													1608-5914	1727-9364				JUL 3	2021	46	3					340	352		10.2989/16085914.2021.1888688	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2021.1888688		MAY 2021											WOS:000647868700001

An understanding of the reference condition requires knowledge of dominant factors influencing ecosystem processes and biological communities. In this paper, we focus on natural physical factors (conditions and processes) that drive coastal wetland ecosystems of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Great Lakes coastal wetlands develop under conditions of large-lake hydrology and disturbance imposed at a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales and contain biotic communities adapted to unstable and unpredictable conditions. Coastal wetlands are configured along a continuum of hydrogeomorphic types: open coastal wetlands, drowned river mouth and flooded delta wetlands, and protected wetlands, each developing distinct ecosystem properties and biotic communities. Hydrogeomorphic factors associated with the lake and watershed operate at a hierarchy of scales: a) local and short-term (seiches and ice action), b) watershed / lakewide / annual (seasonal water- level change), and c) larger or year-to-year and longer (regional and/or greater than one-year). Other physical factors include the unique water quality features of each lake. The aim of this paper is to provide scientists and managers with a framework for considering regional and site-specific geomorphometry and a hierarchy of physical processes in planning management and conservation projects.

Structure and species composition of diatom community during the wet season in three floodplain lakes of Brazilian Pantanal	PLOS ONE												In order to access environmental conditions, the use of bioindicators that have a close relationship with environmental stressors is a largely common practice, but when evaluating environmental inferences, the individual dominant taxa need to be interpreted. Humid regions such as the marshlands are fragile ecosystems and sustain communities of microalgae, often used as bioindicators, of which diatoms are a good example. Although they provide an excellent response to chemical and physical changes in water, diatom studies in surface sediments in wetlands are scarce worldwide. To determine whether diatom species have the potential to provide unambiguous inferences in the influence of environmental factors, we have evaluated diatom abundance in surface sediment, from three Pantanal lakes, against a set of environmental gradients: pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, water temperature, index of trophic water status, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. The Ferradura lake presented an oligotrophic state and both Burro and Caracara lakes presented mesotrophic state. Diatoms were more abundant in the a mesotrophic conditions, but with higher species richness in the oligotrophic conditions. Depending on the N:P ratio, the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus can also play the role of pollutants and may have negative and unpredictable effects in the environment, such as biotic homogenization. Despite the spatial variation in species, there was a greater richness of Eunotia Ehrenberg species, with the highest relative density of Eunotia formica Ehrenberg and E. pantropica Glushchenko, Kulikovskiy & Kociolek, due to the environmental acidic conditions, a determining characteristic of this genus. It was also observed that a small increase in the level of phosphorus generated an increase in the abundance of Aulacoseira Thwaites with the highest relative density of A. pusilla (Meister) Tuji & Houki and A. veraluciae Tremarin, Torgan & T.Ludwig. However, A. italica dominated in the moderately acidic environment. The results can help with decisions in impacted areas to solve socioeconomic problems, environmental management and biodiversity.					; Sampaio, Silvio/F-2629-2013; S C Marques-dos-Santos, Claudia/F-9505-2010	Seghetto Nardelli, Margaret/0000-0002-5280-3185; S C Marques-dos-Santos, Claudia/0000-0001-8864-2611													1932-6203					MAY 5	2021	16	5							e0251063	10.1371/journal.pone.0251063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251063								33951088					WOS:000664610500058
J	Lee, HS; Shin, HS				Lee, Han-Saem; Shin, Hyun-Sang			Evaluation of pollutants characteristics and effect of dissolved and particulate contaminants in tributaries of an urban watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The importance of tributary management is increasing owing to the increase and diversity of pollutant sources in watersheds. In this study, the characteristics of dissolved and particulate contaminants in tributaries of the An yang watershed, South Korea, were investigated using various analytical indicators (e.g., organic matter, nutrients, and spectroscopic analysis), heat maps, and multivariate analysis techniques, including cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), to evaluate water quality characteristics of the tributaries and major pollutant sources. The influence of particulate matter from each tributary was also evaluated by investigating changes in sediment composition and re-suspended sediment oxygen demand (RSOD) at the mainstream of Anyang. The heat map patterns of the evaluated tributaries reflect sufficiently the characteristics of the pollutant sources, which enables the differentiation of the pollutant source according to the tributary locations and seasons. PCA results showed that water quality and spectral indicators reflected the different characteristics of the tributary; thus, it enabled a more diverse evaluation of tributary depending on pollutant source and season. The tributary watershed showed a high suspended solids (SS) discharge load depending on the watershed area (r = 0.94, p < 0.05), and the sediment near the tributary with higher SS discharge load revealed a higher content of fine sand (0.002-0.2 mm, r = 0.84, p < 0.05). The finer the particles derived from tributaries are, the higher the increase in RSOD is due to resuspension, most of which are caused by microbial activity (> 80%). Our results demonstrate that comprehensive and visual evaluation-including spectral indicators and heat maps analysis- of the tributary characteristics of pollutant sources is an efficient approach of broadening the knowledge of the distribution and effects of particulate matter from tributaries.

The metabolic state of Arctic lakes is often considered net heterotrophic, due to an assumed supply of allochthonous organic matter that supports ecosystem respiration and carbon mineralization in excess of rates of primary production. However, lake metabolic patterns vary according to regional climatic characteristics, hydrological connectivity, organic matter sources and intrinsic lake properties, and the metabolism of most Arctic lakes is unknown. We sampled 35 waterbodies along a connectivity gradient from headwater to downstream lakes, on southern Victoria Island, Nunavut, in an area characterized by low precipitation, organic-poor soils, and high evaporation rates. We evaluated whether lakes were net autotrophic or heterotrophic during the open water period using an oxygen isotopic mass balance approach. Most of the waterbodies were autotrophic and sites of net organic matter production or close to metabolic equilibrium. Autotrophy was associated with higher benthic primary production, as compared to its pelagic counterpart, due to the high irradiance reaching the bottom and efficient internal carbon and nutrient cycling. Highly connected midstream and downstream lakes showed efficient organic matter cycling, as evidenced by the strong coupling between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration, while decoupling was observed in some headwater lakes with significantly higher GPP. The shallow nature of lakes in the flat, arid region of southern Victoria Island supports net autotrophy in most lakes during the open water season. Ongoing climate changes that lengthen the ice-free irradiance period and increase rates of nutrient evapoconcentration may further promote net autotrophy, with uncertain long-term effects for lake functioning. We studied the metabolic state of 35 lakes in the Canadian Arctic along a hydrological connectivity gradient. Our findings indicate that the metabolic state of lakes was mostly net autotrophic or in metabolic equilibrium. The metabolic rates were associated with the degree of hydrological connectivity, the position of the lake in the watershed, and lake size, which were determinant factors for the chemical composition and light penetration in the water column. Consequently, higher GPP values were measured in small headwater lakes compared to larger midstream and downstream lakes. Our findings highlight the importance of shallow Arctic lakes as climate regulators.image					Prėskienis, Vilmantas/G-1630-2014; Grosbois, Guillaume/M-8097-2019; Ayala Borda, Paola/OLQ-6243-2025	Ayala-Borda, Paola/0000-0001-5215-9652; Culp, Joseph/0000-0003-3051-8794; Preskienis, Vilmantas/0000-0002-8176-2263; Grosbois, Guillaume/0000-0002-1306-8528; Rautio, Milla/0000-0002-2375-9082													1354-1013	1365-2486				FEB	2024	30	2							e17193	10.1111/gcb.17193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17193								38380447					WOS:001177413700008

This study assessed changes in the spatiotemporal distributions of the water hyacinth in Lake Koka and Ziway of the Upper Awash River basin during the peak growth season of the plant. Household questionnaires and key informant interviews along with Landsat images for 2013, 2017, and 2021 were collected to identify the past, present, and future potential distributions of the invasive plant in the two lakes. Household surveys and key informant interviews were prepared using the Kobo Toolbox which monitors data collection online. A total number of 413 households were sampled and the data were analyzed through descriptive statistics. For Landsat images, a supervised classification technique was applied to classify the land use classes using the maximum likelihood algorithm. The survey results showed increased water hyacinth expansion in the area since the year 2011. The water hyacinth expansion affected 285 households' livelihoods by invading 69.0% of their farmlands which caused 97.6% food scarcity in the study districts. The results of the Landsat image indicated that the water hyacinth invasion in Lake Koka occupied 1.48% in 2013, and this increased to 7.13% in 2021, while the water body decreased from 75.94 to 69.90%, respectively. However, the area of the other vegetation is nearly identical between the years 2013-2021. Likewise, water hyacinth covered 4.66% of Lake Ziway in 2013, and this was raised to 8.42% in 2021. At Lake Ziway water hyacinth invasion affected the area of other vegetation coverage as it decreased from 16.19 to 10.67% but the area of the water body remained almost the same during the years. Between 2013 and 2025, the amount of water hyacinths increased in both Lake Koka and Lake Ziway. According to LULC data, the water hyacinth's rate of spread was 0.56% in Lake Koka and 0.95% in Lake Ziway. The results of this study revealed the signals of LULC change due to water hyacinth invasion in the Upper Awash Basin which is considered an important aspect for future water resources planning and management.

J	Cooper, RZ; Ergas, SJ; Nachabe, M				Cooper, Rachael Z.; Ergas, Sarina J.; Nachabe, Mahmood			Multi-Decadal Nutrient Management and Trends in Two Catchments of Lake Okeechobee	RESOURCES-BASEL												Despite years of efforts to improve water quality, harmful algal blooms remain a chronic phenomenon, with devastating environmental, economic, and social impacts in many regions worldwide. In this study, we assessed the complexity of nutrient pollution attributed to harmful algal blooms in South Florida (USA) by analyzing 20 years of flow and nutrient data within two headwater basins in the Lake Okeechobee (LO) watershed. The study used an established advanced regression method, the Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) method, as an analysis framework to examine the impact of nutrient management practices on water quality trends. The WRTDS method produced total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentration and flux trends, which were then compared with existing and historic nutrient management records within the basin. Results from this study highlight divergences in progress to improve water quality. Nutrient management practices only had a weak impact on TP and TN flux trends in one of the two basins, where TP flux decreased 2% per year, and TN flux decreased 0.1% per year. TP and TN flux increased in the second basin. Variances of improvement between the two basins are likely attributable to differences in contemporary point source loading and legacy nutrient pools from non-point source inputs 20 years or more before the analysis period. The long-lasting impacts of legacy nutrients also emphasize a need for investments in technologies and practices that can withdraw nutrients from enriched soil and water.

This study pioneers investigating the hydrodynamics of a small crater lake in the Philippines with a focus on temperature simulation using a Fantom Refined 3D model that has been tested mostly for temperate and sub-tropical lakes. The lake's monthly temperature during the dry season served as a reference for the model's initial condition and validation. For the simulation to proceed, input data such as weather, inflow, and bathymetry were prepared. In the absence of hourly meteorological data from local weather stations, this paper adopted the satellite weather data from Solcast. Simple correlation analysis of daily weather data between local stations and Solcast showed valid and acceptable results. Inflow values were estimated using the rational method while the stream temperature was estimated from a regression equation using air temperatures as input. The validated satellite-derived data and runoff model can therefore be employed for 3D modeling. The simulations resulted in extremely higher temperatures compared with those observed when using previous default model settings. Direct modifications were then applied to weather parameters, compromising their integrity but resulting in reasonable profiles. By adding scaling factors to heat flux equations and multiplying their components by 0.75 (shortwave), 1.35 (longwave), 0.935 (air temperature), and 0.80 (wind), better results were achieved. This study identifies several challenges in performing 3D hydrodynamic modeling, such as paucity in input hydro-meteorologic and limnologic data and the need for heat flux model improvement. Overall, this study was successful in employing 3D hydrodynamic modeling in a tropical lake, which can pave directions and serve as an excellent reference for future modeling in the same region.					; Yokoyama, Katsuhide/AAM-7655-2021	Monterey, Malone Luke/0009-0000-1721-2390; Duka, Maurice/0000-0002-6343-5138; Casim, Nino Carlo/0009-0006-9399-5589; Yokoyama, Katsuhide/0000-0003-1576-6239; Andres, Jake Henson/0009-0009-7945-0402; 														2073-4441				FEB	2024	16	4							561	10.3390/w16040561	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16040561													WOS:001172652200001

The study has shown that a stratified lake is formed where the shape of the filling (first with groundwater and later surface waters from the nearby rivers were added) has influenced the formation of the lake profile. The Meirama mine is an open-pit brown lignite mine located in NW Spain. Exploitation ended in March 2008, leaving a pit of approximately 146 hm3 with a maximum depth of 205 m. The rehabilitation of the pit consisted of the creation of a lake that will serve as an auxiliary water reservoir for the city of La Coruna. The filling process lasted approximately 8 years (March 2008-May 2016) with subterranean and surface contributions from the environment. The formation of an invariant chemocline and a seasonal thermocline was observed. Therefore, in this work, (the first of a series of two articles), an analysis of the evolution of various physicochemical parameters, elements, and compounds at certain heights (the surface, the first 2 m (2 mbs), at 59 masl, and at the bottom (2 masl)). In this first article, the physicochemical parameters of pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and some metallic elements (iron and manganese) are analysed. From the analyzed parameters it can be seen the creation of a surface thermocline and a chemocline at a depth of 59 masl with the beginning of the formation of anoxic conditions of the bottom of the pit through the consumption of oxygen.					juncosa, ricardo/AAC-9109-2019; Delgado Martin, Jordi/H-7819-2015	Delgado Martin, Jordi/0000-0002-8261-8087; Cereijo Arango, Jose Luis/0000-0002-0593-9725													1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2024	83	3							112	10.1007/s12665-023-11417-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-023-11417-w													WOS:001152178100001
J	Morandus, BM; Rumisha, C				Morandus, Bonus M.; Rumisha, Cyrus			Lack of mitochondrial introgression and limited genetic connectivity among Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas) populations in Tanzanian Saline Rift Valley Lakes	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), native to the Saline Rift Valley Lakes (SRVLs) in north-central Tanzania, has recently experienced population declines mainly due to overfishing and severe droughts. This, combined with the introduction of Nile tilapia (O. niloticus), which poses a risk of hybridisation, could potentially erode essential genetic traits necessary for their survival. To address these concerns, our study analysed partial cytochrome oxidase subunit I sequences (627 base pairs) from 139 Manyara tilapia and 79 Nile tilapia specimens collected from the SRVLs to test two hypotheses: (i) whether there is no transfer of mitochondrial DNA between these species, and (ii) whether Manyara tilapia populations in the SRVLs have remained genetically connected despite reported declines. The results revealed six distinct haplotypes for Manyara tilapia and three for Nile tilapia. These haplotypes formed separate clusters for each species, with no shared or closely related haplotypes, indicating limited or no transfer of mitochondrial DNA between them. Additionally, we found evidence of restricted genetic connectivity among Manyara tilapia populations in the SRVLs, with populations in Lakes Manyara and Eyasi displaying limited genetic exchange among themselves and with those in other SRVLs. Our findings highlight the importance of sustained conservation efforts in protected areas around Lake Manyara and Lake Eyasi to safeguard the unique populations of Manyara tilapia in these lakes. However, limited connectivity with other SRVLs suggests that conservation initiatives in these areas may have a limited impact on these lakes. Thus, future efforts should prioritise stocks in Lakes Kindai, Singida and Sulunga, focusing on protecting fish refugia, particularly the rivers connected to these lakes, which serve as critical habitats during the dry season and as important reservoirs for replenishing these populations.					; Rumisha, Cyrus/V-6019-2019	Morandus, Bonus M/0000-0003-4348-9769; Rumisha, Cyrus/0000-0002-8240-7087													0141-6707	1365-2028				FEB	2024	62	2							e13267	10.1111/aje.13267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.13267													WOS:001207861600001

Evaluation of fish spawning habitat at offshore reefs in southwest Lake Michigan using side-scan sonar and underwater video	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Offshore reefs in the Laurentian Great Lakes provide critical spawning habitats for native lake trout. Though many historic spawning reefs have been documented, thorough evaluation of the habitat they contain is rare. After decades of stocking, natural recruitment of lake trout has increased dramatically in the Illinois waters of Lake Michigan since 2010, reinforcing the need for information about the viability and distribution of spawning habitats. Using side-scan sonar and underwater video, this study sought to map bottom substrates at Lake Bluff Reef and Gumby's Reef, offshore of the northern Illinois coast of Lake Michigan, to describe and quantify the availability of substrates suitable for lake trout spawning. Substrates were manually delineated in ArcGIS using side-scan sonar imagery mosaics. Underwater video was used to verify substrate classifications through direct observation. Suitable spawning substrate consisting of fractured bedrock debris and piled boulder/cobble was observed at both reefs. Underwater video revealed the presence of lake trout at both reefs in the weeks leading up to the spawning season. The largest congregation of fish was observed in the vicinity of the shallowest points, steep slopes, and the largest patches of spawning substrate. The distribution, amount, and condition of spawning substrate available at each reef was in line with others studied in the region and their likely importance for lake trout spawning was reinforced by observed aggregations of mature fish. This study has expanded the inventory of well-documented offshore reefs in the Illinois waters of Lake Michigan, enhancing appreciation of what is coming to be understood as the Illinois Reef Complex. Knowledge of the distribution and status of habitats critical to the life history of native fishes in the Great Lakes are necessary for managers to properly assess, manage, and conserve lake trout and other fish populations.																			1052-7613	1099-0755				FEB	2024	34	2							e4092	10.1002/aqc.4092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.4092													WOS:001159996400001

Using time series measurements of meteorology and water-column temperatures from 17 several day campaigns spanning two hydrological years in a representative Amazon floodplain lake, we calculated surface energy fluxes and thermal stratification, and applied and evaluated a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The model successfully simulated diel cycles in thermal structure characterized by buoyancy frequency, depth of the actively mixing layer, and other terms associated with the surface energy budget. Diurnal heating with strong stratification and nocturnal mixing were common; despite considerable heat loss at night, the strong stratification during the day meant that mixing only infrequently extended to the bottom at night. Simulations indicated that the diurnal thermocline up and downwelled creating lake-wide differences in near-surface temperatures and mixing depths. Infrequent full mixing creates conditions conducive to anoxia in these shallow lakes given their warm temperatures. Diel thermal structure in a tropical floodplain lake was characterized by high-resolution field measurements over two hydrological years State and process evaluation show that diel and seasonal stratification and mixing were simulated well by a 3-D hydrodynamic model Diurnal heating with strong stratification and nocturnal mixing were common while mixing to the bottom was intermittent					Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022; Zhou, Wencai/ABB-4141-2022	Zhou, Wencai/0000-0002-9929-8702; Amaral, Joao Henrique/0000-0002-8992-6082													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2024	60	2							e2022WR034057	10.1029/2022WR034057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR034057													WOS:001169694800001

Warmer climates forces strong effects on lake biota for fish, leading to a reduction in size, changes in diet, more frequent reproduction, and stronger cascading effects. Space-for-time substitution studies (SFTS) are often used to unravel climate effects on lakes biota; however, results from continental lakes are potentially confounded by biogeographical and evolutionary differences, also leading to an overall higher fish species richness in warm lakes. Such differences may not be found in lakes on remote islands, where natural fish free lakes have been subjected to stocking only during the past few hundred years. We studied 20 species-poor lakes located in two remote island groups with contrasting climates, but similar seasonality: the Faroe Islands (cold; 6.5 +/- 2.8 degrees C annual average (SD) and the Azores Islands (warm; 17.3 +/- 2.9 degrees C)). As for mainland lakes, mean body size of fish in the warmer lakes were smaller overall, and phytoplankton per unit of phosphorus higher. The delta C-13 carbon range for basal organisms, and for the whole food web, appeared wider in colder lakes. In contrast to previous works in continental fresh waters, Layman metrics of the fish food web were similar between the two climatic regions. Our results from insular systems provide further evidence that ambient temperatures, at least partially, drive the changes in fish size structure and the cascading effects found along latitude gradients in lakes.

Evidence of reservoir response in low latitudes is still limited. In this study, the vertical profile of water temperature in the Barra Bonita Reservoir (Brazil) is simulated using the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM), calibrated, and validated using in-situ data. Water temperature and reservoir hydrodynamics are simulated over 26 years (1993-2018) to investigate warming trends, seasonal patterns, Schmidt stability, and the number of stratified days per year. Results indicate that the reservoir has experienced significant warming since 1993 related to increasing air temperature and decreasing wind speed. Water temperature increases (p value <0.001) from the surface (+ 1.02 degrees C per decade) to the bottom (0.33 degrees C per decade). Higher warming rates are detected during the dry and cold season. Significant increasing trends are found for Schmidt stability and in the number of stratified days per year. Deepwater warming is directly related to increasing air temperature and frequent mixing episodes which transfer heat from surface to bottom waters. A deep outlet structure and an artificially controlled water level may enhance deepwater warming during the dry season. Our findings contribute to the understanding of subtropical reservoirs' response to climate change and help to guide planning strategies for ensuring the security of water storage and ecosystem services they provide.

Length-weight relationships of 6 fish species caught in a Mediterranean lake (Trichonis-NW Greece)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												In the present study the length-weight relationships (LWRs) of 6 fish species which are endemic to Western Greece, caught in the natural Lake Trichonis by experimental gillnets and electrofishing were estimated. Benthic (mesh size 5-55 mm; height 1.5 m; length 30 m) and pelagic (mesh size 6.25-55 mm; height 6 m; length 27.5 m) Nordic type multimesh gillnets were used seasonally, between February 2019 and November 2019, at different depth zones (0-57m). Electrofishing (80 Hz) conducted in the littoral zone of the lake during four samplings (2018, 2019).

J	Hessen, DO; Andersen, T; Brettum, P; Faafeng, BA				Hessen, DO; Andersen, T; Brettum, P; Faafeng, BA			Phytoplankton contribution to sestonic mass and elemental ratios in lakes: Implications for zooplankton nutrition	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton carbon and particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PON), and phosphorus (POP) (POC: PON: POP) were analyzed in 109 temperate lakes covering a wide span in productivity and other key parameters. Seasonal means of total POC (four samples) ranged from 206 to 7160 mug C L-1, with a grand mean of 960 mug C L-1, whereas estimated phytoplankton C ranged 12 to 1,770 mug C L-1, with a mean of 217 mug C L-1. Sestortic C:P ratios ranged from 59 to 553 (atom: atom), with a mean of 207. The elemental contributions from phytoplankton and other sestonic compartments (mainly detritus) were analyzed with a simple regression model, in which autochthonous and allochthonous components were separated. Model-derived estimates for N: P ratios of phytoplankton and allochthonous seston compartments were nearly equal (15.4 +/- 2.5 and 16.0 +/- 2.0) and were not significantly different from the Redfield N: P ratio (16). The estimated C: P ratio of allochthonous detritus was 2.7 times higher than that for phytoplankton (123 +/- 15), which again was not significantly different from the Redfield C:P ratio (106). Altogether, this indicates that sestonic components of autochthonous origin should be closer to Redfield proportions in eutrophic than in oligotrophic lakes. It also indicates that major contributions of allochthonous detrital C in oligotrophic lake seston may explain deviations from the Redfield ratio and calls for caution when interpreting elemental ratios in algae versus total seston. The regression model indicates that live phytoplankton cells rarely exceed 40% of total POC, yet it suggests that a major fraction of detritus is derived from autotrophs. This close link between live and dead cells could explain why total seston apparently carries the stoichiometric and biochemical footprints from the phytoplankton. Judged from algal biomass alone, Daphnia would face severe food limitation in a majority of lakes, while if we were to include total seston, Daphnia would be above threshold food levels in all lakes. Likewise, the effect of food quality limitation related to C: P ratios will turn out differently if total seston or only the phytoplankton fraction is considered.

Reconstruction of glacier fluctuations in the East Sayan, Baikalsky and Kodar Ridges (East Siberia, Russia) during the last 210 years based on high-resolution geochemical proxies from proglacial lake bottom sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												We have presented results of study of bottom sediments of the proglacial lakes enriched with meltwater of Peretolchin Glacier (the East Sayan Ridge), Chersky Glacier (the Baikalsky Ridge) and glaciers of the Kodar Ridge. Bottom sediments formed from the end of the Little Ice Age to 2013 were investigated with time resolution in year-season, using X-ray fluorescence with synchrotron radiation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Depth-age models of the cores were estimated from year laminate layers, using Pb-210 and Cs-137 chronology. Intense glacier thawing was calculated from the amount of clastic matter supplied by glacier meltwater into proglacial lakes. A high content of some elements was closely associated with clastic material (e.g. Rb, Zr, Nb, Y or Th) in bottom sediments, and most likely these elements affected the intensity of glacier melting. We have defined three periods in significant increase of glacier flow/melting during the last 210 years. The first period (ca. 1800-1890), supply of suspended material by meltwater into Lake Ekhoy (the East Sayan Ridge) and Lake Preobrazhenskoe (the Kodar Ridge), was not intense until 1850 and 1875, respectively. However, the rate of meltwater supply into Lake Izumrudnoe (the Baikalsky Ridge) was high during the Little Ice Age, and it is likely attributed to local moisture from Lake Baikal. The regional glacier water balances were most likely positive during the second period (ca. 1890-1940).

To test the general validity of such hypotheses, we assessed diel and inter-sex differences in diet and feeding intensity of 232 gobies (144 female [54 day:90 night] and 88 male [39 day:49 night]) caught during the breeding season. Gobies took primarily aquatic insect larvae and did not predate on eggs, larvae or juveniles of native fish. Unlike previous studies, we observed no diel difference in feeding intensity or diet composition; hence no universal did l pattern can be implied for round goby feeding. On the other hand, we observed significant inter-sex differences in both feeding intensity and diet composition, with males consuming less food than females, presumably due to restricted feeding activity during nest-guarding. Inter-sex shifts in both diet composition and amount of food were less than expected, however, suggesting that, under most conditions, there is no reason to expect a fatal decrease in male energy intake, as suggested by some earlier studies.

J	Finkelstein, SA; Gaiewski, K				Finkelstein, Sarah A.; Gaiewski, K.			A palaeolimnological record of diatomcommunity dynamics and late-Holocene climatic changes from Prescott Island, Nunavut, central Canadian Arctic	HOLOCENE												Palaeolimnological analyses from Lake PW03, a small, dilute lake on crystalline bedrock on Prescott Island, Nunavut, Canada (73 degrees 07' N, 96 degrees 41' W, 243 in a.s.l.), provide a sensitive record of the impacts of Holocene climatic change on diatom communities. A high-resolution sequence from 3500 cal. BP to present indicates that a significant change in diatom assemblages takes place at 2300 cal. BP, when alkaliphilous fragilarioids and planktonic taxa are replaced by benthic, epiphytic and acidophilous diatoms. These changes coincidc with the onset of neoglacial cooling and likely reflect more persistent ice-cover and associated acidification of lake water. Maximum diatom species richness occurs during this period of transition. Dense bryophyte communities in the littoral zone provide habitats to sustain diatom production even under the cooler conditions following 2300 cal. BP. The concentration of diatom valves declines at 500 cal. BP, coincident with cooling at the time of the 'Little Ice Age', and minor changes in species composition take place at that time. The sediments deposited over the past 150 years show modest increases in fragilarioids and planktonic diatoms, in response to a longer ice-free season under a warmer climate. Diatom valve production increases significantly in these recent sediments but increases in diversity are relatively small. Diatom diversity, production and the species composition of diatom communities do not change simultaneously in response to climatic changes.					; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012	Finkelstein, Sarah/0000-0002-8239-399X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2007	17	6					803	812		10.1177/0959683607080521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683607080521													WOS:000250623100009

Integration of smallholder wetland aquaculture-agriculture systems (fingerponds) into riparian farming systems on the shores of Lake Victoria, Kenya: socio-economics and livelihoods	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												This paper presents the results of experimental fingerponds: an integrated flood recession aquaculture-agriculture production system in the Lake Victoria wetlands in Kenya. The overall aim of the study is to assess the potential of fingerponds as a sustainable wetland farming system for improving food security at the subsistence level and within the context of the existing livelihood activities. The contribution of this new activity to rural household livelihoods is evaluated. Since it is a sustainable technology, based on natural events, the production level is intermediate and the benefits may not be high in the short term. Economic analysis shows that the gross margin and net income of fingerponds is about 752 and 197 Euros per hectare per year, respectively. This is about an 11% increase in the annual gross margin of an average rural household around Lake Victoria. The additional per capita fish supply is 3 kg per season or more from a 192 m(2) pond. The potential fish protein supply of 200 kg/ha is high compared with most existing terrestrial protein production systems. Fingerponds have the potential to contribute to household food security and to improve livelihoods. Sensitivity analysis indicates that biophysical variations, which may occur from one wetland to another, have implications for the functioning, and consequently the economic performance, of fingerponds. This reinforces the need for the integration of these systems into other household activities to buffer the household against potential risk.

J	Lantry, BF; O'Gorman, R				Lantry, Brian F.; O'Gorman, Robert			Drying temperature effects on fish dry mass measurements	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Analysis of tissue composition in fish often requires dry samples. Time needed to dry fish decreases as temperature is increased, but additional volatile material may be lost. Effects of 10 degrees C temperature increases on percentage dry mass (%DM) were tested against 60 degrees C controls for groups of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus, and alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. Lake trout %DMs were lower at greater temperatures, but not significantly different from 60 degrees C controls. Rainbow smelt and slimy sculpin %DMs were lower at greater temperatures and differences were significant when test temperatures reached 90 degrees C. Significant differences were not found in tests using alewives because variability in %DM was high between fish. To avoid inter-fish variability, 30 alewives were each dried successively at 60, 70, 80, and then 90 degrees C and for all fish %DM declined at each higher temperature. In general, %DMs were lower at greater temperatures and after reaching a stable dry weight, fish did not lose additional mass if temperature remained constant. Results indicate that caution should be used when comparing dry mass related indices from fish dried at different temperatures because %DM was negatively related to temperature. The differences in %DM observed with rising temperature could account for substantial portions of the variability in reported energy values for the species tested. Differences in %DM means for the 60 vs. 80 degrees C and 60 vs. 90 degrees C tests for rainbow smelt and alewife could represent of from 8 to 38% of observed annual energy cycles for Lakes Ontario and Michigan.																			0380-1330					SEP	2007	33	3					606	616		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[606:DTEOFD]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[606:DTEOFD]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000250365400008

Previous paleobotanical studies on these sedimentary rocks and adjacent areas interpreted very diverse climates for the Early Miocene: from humid temperate to dry subtropical. In this study, a rich thermophilous pollen spectrum and a diverse subarid flora including Nitraria, Caesalpiniaceae, Ephedra and Acacia, indicative of a dry subtropical climate are identified. On the other hand, mesothermic taxa with high water requirements are also abundant. Therefore, the pollen assemblages evidence the juxtaposition of very contrasted environments: the presence of subdesertic taxa, typical of plants growing in the lowlands and conditioned by a long warm, dry season, together with others with very high water requirements, needing constant water. This can be explained by the presence of the Rubielos de Mora Lake providing local conditions for developing riparian forests. The vegetation was clearly controlled by the water availability under a subtropical and dry-seasonal climate. Pollen changes along the succession, which coincide with sedimentological changes, are related to climatic variations. Alternation in pollen taxa (thermophilous-dry vs. mesothermic-riparian) reflects the influence of the cyclicity of temperature and precipitation on the lake level and vegetation.

J	Hung, DQ; Thiemann, W				Hung, DQ; Thiemann, W			Contamination by selected chlorinated pesticides in surface waters in Hanoi, Vietnam	CHEMOSPHERE												Fifteen insecticides, which were banned in Vietnam in the period from 1990 to 1998, were chosen for the investigation of surface water samples in Hanoi and its surroundings. The investigation was focused on an area of approximate to30 by 20 kin. Thirty water samples, in total were analysed: 11 samples from the Red river, seven from the Duong river, four from various lakes (West lake, Thuyen Quang, Bay Mau, Ba Mau), six from irrigation canals and two samples from wells. The procedure was repeated in November 1998 and in August 1999. The results showed that the contamination of the banned pesticides was highest in the rivers and then in the irrigation canals, followed by the lakes and wells. These pesticides could hardly be determined in just two drinking water samples (wells) and their concentrations rarely exceeded detection limits (0.05-0.25 ngl(-1)). The mean concentrations of SigmaHCHs (alpha, beta, gamma, delta-HCH) and SigmaDDTs (2,4-, 4,4'-DDE; 2,4'-, 4,4-DDD; 2,4'-, 4,4'-DDT) in the rivers were 17.2 +/- 71.8 and 43.7 +/- 79.9 ng1(-1) in the dry season (DS, November 1998), 29.3 +/- 117 and 56.1 +/- 65.6 ng1(-1) in the rainy season (RS, August 1999), respectively. However, the highest concentration of DDTs detected in a river sample (DS): 0.324 mug1(-1) was much lower than their allowable limit of concentration in surface waters, which is accorded with Criteria of Vietnam (1995) (DDTs < 10 mug1(-1)). Moreover, endrin, heptachlor, aldrin were also detected in most of water samples with considerable mean concentrations in rivers: 25.3 +/- 40.5, 17.4 +/- 23.8, 11.0 +/- 9.02 ng1(-1) in the DS and 18.5 +/- 23.2, 19.3 +/- 29.0, 12.8 +/- 8.44 ng1(-1) in the RS, respectively. Heptachlor epoxide (isomer A) and dieldrin were detected in some water samples with lowest concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Can reservoir and groundwater storage buffer the impacts of climate-induced declines in snowpack storage for agriculture and the environment? Insights from the Walker River Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Climate-induced declines in snowpack storage have profound consequences for snowmelt-dependent river basins globally, including those in the western United States. These basins face the risk of economic losses in agriculture and environmental damage due to disrupted instream flows. To mitigate these potential losses, two strategies are commonly employed: enhancing built reservoir storage capacity and increasing groundwater use during the irrigation season. However, implementing these strategies carries the risk of exacerbating instream flow disruptions and compromising the sustainability of aquifers. This article develops a hydro-economic optimization model of Nevada's Walker River Basin (WRB) and uses it to examine the impact of storage capacity and groundwater management on mitigating economic losses in agriculture caused by altered snowmelt-driven inflows. The model accounts for environmental constraints on instream flows that limit water availability for agricultural use. Results show that the WRB is projected to experience a decline in irrigated farm acreage and agricultural output due to reduced snowpack storage. The findings also indicate diminishing returns on reservoir capacity investments, while highlighting the increased value of these investments when groundwater pumping is constrained due to aquifer sustainability concerns. Results show that upgrading existing reservoir capacity by not more than 1.5% in a free water leasing market could protect upwards of 94% and 83% of baseline agricultural income when the basin faces future climate-induced early season snowmelt-driven flow timing, and reduced streamflow, respectively, while managing the basin for hydrologic and environmental constraints.

The highest overland runoff loads and nitrogen losses were measured under the upland at a convergent footslope. Much higher runoff, sediment and nitrogen losses were observed under upland cropping and vegetable fields than that under chestnut orchard and bamboo forest. Sediment associated nitrogen losses accounted for 8-43.5% of total nitrogen export via overland runoff. N lost in dissolved inorganic nitrogen forms (NO3--N + NH4+-N) accounted for less than 50% of total water associated nitrogen export. Agricultural practices and weather-driven fluctuation in discharge were main reasons for the temporal variations in nutrient losses via stream discharge. Significant correlation between the total nitrogen concentration and stream discharge load was observed. Simple regression models could give satisfactory results for prediction of the total nitrogen concentrations in stream water and can be used for better quantifying nitrogen losses from arable land. Nitrogen losses from the studied watershed via stream discharge during rice season in the year 2002 were estimated to be 10.5 kg N/ha using these simple models.																			0269-4042					JUN-SEP	2004	26	2-3					199	207		10.1023/B:EGAH.0000039582.68882.7f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:EGAH.0000039582.68882.7f								15499775					WOS:000223553200012

It receives different types of pollutants through its main tributary, the Grande River of Morelia. The aim of this work was to determine if high concentrations of iron, zinc, and arsenic are present in sediments in an area near the river mouth to the lake, as well as to estimate the partitioning of these metals using a sequential extraction procedure in order to obtain information of their potential bioavailability. Sediment samples were collected from three different sites in Cuitzeo Lake and two sites in Grande River in both dry and wet seasons. A sequential extraction procedure was carried out to determine the concentrations of these elements in different geochemical phases of the sediments. Total metal concentrations were evaluated by using the enrichment factor and the geoaccumulation index. A comparison with sediment quality guidelines and shale values has also been made. The results indicate that sediments are considered unpolluted by iron and moderately polluted by zinc and arsenic. However, fractionation studies showed that significant amounts of Zn and As could be released to the lake ecosystem depending on the environmental conditions, representing a medium risk potential of bioavailability to the biota.

Extreme trophic segregation between sympatric fish species: the case of small sized body Aphyocharax in the Brazilian Pantanal	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Interspecific differences in diet of the two sympatric fish species of the subfamily Aphyocharacinae were investigated. Both were sampled monthly (March 2000 to February 2001) during the rainy and dry season in North region of the Pantanal. Aphyocharax anisitsi was an invertivorous/insectivorous species, feeding mainly on aquatic insects during the rainy season and terrestrial insects in the dry season. Aphyocharax dentatus remained a piscivorous regardless of the hydrological season. Low feeding-overlap values, 0.079 in the dry season and no overlap in the rainy season were observed. The diet-breadth values for each species were low (less than 0.1) except for A. anisitsi in the lake during the dry season (0.4). A detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) summarized the diet similarity patterns: in DCA 1, it was observed that fish prey grouped A. dentatus in the lower scores, and insect prey grouped A. anisitsi in the higher scores. A two-way ANOVA showed that the diets differed significantly between the species. Our results show a clear trophic segregation between these species, supporting the niche concept that presumes that differences between sympatric species must exist, to allow their coexistence. Besides extreme segregation, it was clear that A. dentatus is a piscivorous fish, despite its low size (until 72 mm). This finding counteracts the current view about food web structure that poses a direct and positive relationship between body size and trophic position.

J	Fink, P; Peters, L; Von Elert, E				Fink, P; Peters, L; Von Elert, E			Stoichiometric mismatch between littoral invertebrates and their periphyton food	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Ecological stoichiometry is considered a key concept in understanding constraints in energy transfer at the plant-herbivore interface. However, whether this concept is relevant for benthic freshwater ecosystems is not fully known. Therefore, a field survey was conducted in 2003 during the growing season in the littoral zone of Lake Constance, a large pre-alpine lake in central Europe. The aim was to assess temporal variation in the elemental stoichiometric composition in both herbivorous macro-invertebrates and their food resource, the periphyton in two different lakes. The periphyton showed large temporal and spatial variation in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content, with particularly high molar C:P ratios of up to 1225:1. Periphyton C:P and C:N ratios were often high and constantly above the Redfield ratio that is considered optimal for autotrophic growth. In contrast to the pronounced fluctuations in the nutrient ratios of their food resource, the herbivorous macroinvertebrates showed only very little variation in their nutrient ratios, which indicated that they are homeostatic, i.e., physiologically restricted to a comparatively narrow range of C:P and C:N ratios. Distinct species-specific C:P and C:N ratios were found for different taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates, which indicated different requirements of optimal dietary C: P and C: N ratios and which might influence the ability of the taxa to compete for limiting elemental nutrients. Considering the temporally very high C: P and C: N ratios of the periphytic resource and the very low ratios of the consumer body tissue, this stoichiometric mismatch is likely to constrain growth and reproduction of these littoral invertebrates. Therefore, the concept of stoichiometric food quality limitation might also be applicable to the littoral food web in lakes.					von Elert, Eric/S-1666-2018; Peters, Lars/B-9660-2009; Fink, Patrick/A-5901-2009	von Elert, Eric/0000-0001-7758-716X; Fink, Patrick/0000-0002-5927-8977													0003-9136					FEB	2006	165	2					145	165		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0145													WOS:000236181400001

A total of 783 individuals, aged 6-60 years, were enrolled. They were first given a single oral dose of praziquantel (50 mg/kg). Then, they were randomly assigned oral artemether (6 mg/kg) or placebo, administered once every 2 weeks for 9-11 doses, covering the entire transmission season for Schistosoma japonicum in 2004. Stool examination 1 month after the final dosing revealed eggs of S. japonicum in 3/373 (0.8%) of the artemether recipients and 56/361 (15.0%) in placebo recipients (chi(2) = 53.69, P < 0.00 1). Compared to the baseline, the geometric mean intensity of S. japonicum infection had decreased by 96.1 % in the artemether group, and increased by 50.8% in the placebo group. No acute cases of schistosomiasis japonica were observed in the artemether group, whereas three such cases were reported from the placebo group. Compliance with regard to multi-doses of artemether and placebo was 84.9, and 77.9%, respectively. This study confirms that repeated oral artemether produces no drug-related adverse effects, significantly reduces incidence and intensity of patent S. japonicum infection and results in high compliance. Hence it can be used as an additional toot for the control of schistosomiasis japonica in the lake regions of China. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is good evidence that during the Pleistocene and early Holocene a large lake existed in the Makgadikgadi Basin which, however, became increasingly smaller during the Holocene. For the late Holocene when the regional human population began to grow, no data (except for the last two centuries) about lake levels and thus surface water availability have been published. Age estimates of selected Baobab trees of two size-classes growing on "Kubu Island", a granite outcrop which is located in a "coastal" position at the south-western edge of Sua Pan, are used to infer that at least during the early centuries of the last millennium a maximum lake level of 908 m a.s.l. was reached. During this lake phase Sua Pan and Ntwetwe Pan were interconnected and large wetlands were created. Large numbers of game and livestock could be sustained.

A.; Beltz, Ryan			Some Observations of Diatoms Under Turbulence	SILICON												The effect of turbulence on several freshwater diatom taxa was investigated and our findings are described herein. We have compared diatom morphology in shallow natural systems that experience turbulence due to wind and in river/waterfall systems where turbulence is due to high flow rates. We have also introduced turbulence into diatom laboratory cultures by mechanical shaking and by forcing air into the media. In particular, we have studied diatoms in five independent environments or cultures: the freshwater diatoms Tabellaria and Eunotia in equatorial lakes experiencing extreme seasonal variability in depth; two freshwater diatom monocultures of Aulacoseira granulata var angustissima and Melosira varians in the laboratory; and a freshwater diatom community possessing equal amounts (by number) of elongated and non-elongated diatoms (mostly Nitzschia and mostly Cyclotella, respectively) in the laboratory. We have demonstrated the effect of turbulence on freshwater diatom frustule morphologies and, perhaps more importantly, the effect of turbulence on freshwater diatom species population after controlled perturbation of the organisms' environment. It has been widely reported that symmetry is often preferred in biological evolution, however here we have observed a preference towards asymmetry for the survival of diatoms in the presence of environmental stress (in particular, turbulence). We also note that to date there have been no systematic attempts to manipulate diatom frustules using external stimuli. We therefore present a proof-of-concept study in order to demonstrate: (i) that diatom morphologies can be manipulated by controlled simple external triggers (chemical and physical) (ii) that population balance (i. e. natural selection) can be controlled via simple external triggers (chemical and physical). This approach could open up an entire new field of future studies wherein controlled environmental perturbations are used to manipulate the structure, form, growth and reproduction of biological species.

Biomarker evidence of macrophyte and plankton community changes in Zeekoevlei, a shallow lake in South Africa	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Zeekoevlei is the largest freshwater lake in South Africa and has a century-long history of anthropogenic impact that caused hyper-eutrophic conditions. We used biomarkers (alkanes and pigments), stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15), rates of primary palaeoproduction and total inorganic carbon (TIC) accumulation rates in the lake sediments to investigate changes in plankton and macrophyte communities in response to anthropogenic activities in this shallow lake. Specific alkanes (I C-15 pound,C-17,C-19, pristane, phytane and n-C-29/n-C-17 ratio) and pigment (chlorophyll a, beta,beta-carotene, echinenone, fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin) concentrations in lake waters indicated the present-day hyper-eutrophic condition and seasonal fluctuations of cyanobacteria, zooplankton and diatom populations. Eutrophic conditions were initiated in the lake with the start of recreational activities and construction of a sewage treatment plant in the early 1920s. The lake transformed from a eutrophic to a hyper-eutrophic waterbody following damming, pondweed eradication and accelerated catchment-derived nutrient input. The change in lake trophic state was recorded by a sharp decline in the terrestrial to aquatic ratio (TAR) of specific n-alkanes, low carbon preference index (CPI) and increased delta C-13 values in the sediment core. In addition, the aquatic macrophyte n-alkane proxy (P-aq) values (similar to 1) indicated a slow takeover by floating macrophytes after the eradication of submerged pondweeds in 1951. Elevated n-alkane (I C-15 pound,C-17,C-19), total alkane and pigment (chlorophyll a, beta,beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and zeaxanthin to beta,beta-carotene ratio) concentrations, low delta N-15 values and low TIC accumulation rates in the upper middle section of the core indicated the beginning of intense cyanobacterial blooms after the dredging in 1983. Although the cyanobacterial population has decreased in recent years, hyper-eutrophic conditions are reflected by low CPI < 0.04 and TAR < 1 values at the top of the sediment core.					; Das, Supriyo/AAE-3814-2021	Routh, Joyanto/0000-0001-7184-1593; Das, Supriyo/0000-0002-3304-8161; Roychoudhury, Alakendra/0000-0002-5627-8891; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2009	41	3					507	521		10.1007/s10933-008-9241-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9241-3													WOS:000263543300007

Seasonal differences in larval sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) sensitivity to the pesticide TFM	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) are controlled in the Great Lakes with 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl) phenol (commonly 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol or TFM). The proper amount of TFM must be applied during treatments to effectively kill larval sea lamprey while minimizing impacts to non-target species. In this study, bioassay tests were conducted in May, July, and September in a portable test trailer at six larval sea lamprey infested rivers in Michigan to determine potential seasonal changes in sensitivity of larval sea lamprey to TFM. Larvae greater than 60 mm were collected from each stream and exposed for 12 h in TFM-treated stream water using two independent continuous-flow diluter systems. A suite of water chemistries and larval physiological parameters were collected during the tests and modeled as potential predictors of seasonal changes in the sensitivity of larval sea lamprey to TFM. The observed minimum lethal concentrations to larval sea lamprey were 0-40% lower (May), 8% lower-59% higher (July), and 49-117% higher (September) than sea lamprey control personnel treatment prediction charts. Water temperature, liver glycogen content, and time of year were strongly associated with seasonal differences in TFM sensitivity, offering sea lamprey control personnel more exact predictions to limit potential residual lamprey surviving future treatments.

Methane harvesting for energy production began in 2015, and a monitoring programme was set up to assess possible disturbance on the ecosystem. Phytoplankton biomass and composition was assessed twice per month or monthly at 2 monitoring sites between June 2005 and December 2019, based on HPLC analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and marker pigments. This long-term series shows that significant changes occurred around 2010 in the lake phytoplankton, with a notable increase of Chl-a and changes in the assemblage toward an increase in non-motile green algae and diatoms. To assess possible changes due to methane harvesting, we compared 2 periods, 2012-2014 and 2018-2019. Chl-a concentration decreased slightly in 2018-2019 compared to the reference period of 2012-2014, and significant changes occurred in composition of the phytoplankton assemblage. In terms of relative contribution to Chl-a, diatoms increased from 26% to 46%, whereas green algae decreased similar to 2-fold, from 35% in 2012-2014 to 18% in 2018-2019. Multivariate analyses showed that phytoplankton composition was influenced by seasonal and interannual variations of limnological variables related to changes in meteorological factors. To assess possible future changes due to methane exploitation, we recommend increasing sampling frequency and taxonomic resolution, as well as improving environmental data acquisition.					; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021	Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				APR 3	2021	11	2					223	233		10.1080/20442041.2021.1888624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.1888624		APR 2021											WOS:000642563900001

Todd			Comparing Watershed Scale P Losses from Manure Spreading in Temperate Climates across Mechanistic Soil P Models	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Watershed scale modeling is commonly used to evaluate nutrient fluxes to surface waterbodies and the appropriateness of regulatory intervention, such as the implementation of a total maximum daily load (TMDL). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a widely used watershed-scale model employed to simulate streamflow and nutrient fluxes, including phosphorus (P), from nonpoint sources, which has become ubiquitous throughout nutrient management legislation in the US. A number of studies have shown that manure spread on fields has high potential for nutrient loss in surface runoff directly following application. The authors evaluated the influence of the seasonality of hydrologic fluxes on P losses from dairy manure spread fields during this especially labile period across three mechanistic soil P loss models: SWAT v2012, SWAT v2016, and JoFlo. Calibration was performed using a DDS algorithm for SWAT v2012 and JoFlo and results of the SWAT v2012 calibration were applied to SWAT v2016. Calibration results were non-ideal; however, we propose that our methodology appropriately isolates the processes of concern and furthers the debate on what remains a critical open question. SWAT v2016 and JoFlo show a strong influence of seasonality with respect to P losses from manure-spread field, in agreement with recent field-scale studies. SWAT v2012, commonly utilized for establishing nutrient management policy, demonstrated a limited influence of seasonal hydrology on P losses, suggesting issues in the underlying mechanisms driving labile P mobilization. Our study reinforces the idea that development of hydrologic model structure should strive to parallel the intent of environmental policy. (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Phytoplankton nutrient deficiencies vary with season in sub-tropical lakes of Nepal	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This is one of few studies to comprehensively examine seasonality and phytoplankton nutrient deficiency in sub-tropical lakes over multiple years, to our knowledge. We tested whether phytoplankton communities in two sub-tropical impoundments in the mid-hills of Nepal were nitrogen (N)-, phosphorus (P)-, or co-deficient in N and P across pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons spanning a decade. Nutrient limitation to phytoplankton growth was assessed via in situ stoichiometry of N and P (N:P ratios) and nutrient stimulation experiments (NSEs). The experiments indicated co-deficiency of N and P in 97-100% of NSEs in all seasons. N-deficiency was common (>60% of N:P ratios and similar to 90% of NSEs) during the rainy monsoon, but P-deficiency occurred twice as often as N-deficiency during drier seasons (pre- and post-monsoon). These findings provide perspective for the ongoing debate over N and P as limiting nutrients in freshwater ecosystems by incorporating seasonality and corresponding hydrology. We also re-visit long-standing assumptions regarding the nutrient status of sub-tropical lakes. The warm, stratified season does not fully illustrate lake processes, and more research during dry periods will inform how seasonality affects phytoplankton nutrient deficiencies across aquatic systems.					; Rowland, Freya/ABE-3009-2021	Rowland, Freya/0000-0002-1041-5301; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2019	833	1					157	172		10.1007/s10750-019-3897-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-3897-8													WOS:000460694400011
J	Tsai, CW; Treadwell, H				Tsai, Christina W.; Treadwell, Huntington			Analysis of trends and variability of toxic concentrations in the Niagara River using the Hilbert-Huang transform method	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												This study introduces a more recent data analysis method, Hilbert Huang Transform method (HHT), to describe contaminant concentration data of a non-stationary and non-linear nature. In order to improve the modeling of the contaminant concentrations, it is proposed to first process the data using the Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method from HI-IT to obtain a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which can then be modeled separately using either autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models expanded with a seasonal term, or linear regression analysis, depending on the nature of the IMF. Three priority contaminants measured at Niagara-on-the-Lakes are selected for this study. It is found that the trend of fluoranthene concentrations from April of 1986 to March of 1997 is decreasing and then beginning to increase; the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene concentrations are decreasing; while the dieldrin concentrations are decreasing. With HHT, appropriate time series models can be identified and constructed for the studied contaminant concentrations to better illustrate the variability of each IMF (and thus the contaminant concentrations) for the studied period. For all data sets modeled in this study, pre-processing the data with HHT allowed for higher R-2 values, correlation coefficients and lower sum of squared errors when compared to modeling without HHT. It is thus confirmed that pre-processing the data with HHT and modeling with time series analysis will provide a more effective means of the studied data sets when identifying and analyzing the trends and variability of studied contaminant concentrations in the Niagara River.

Empirical and semi-empirical models are frequently developed and applied for estimating C-SPM values from remote sensing images; however, they are usually region- or season-dependent. This study aimed to develop a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based retrieval model of C-SPM for Poyang and Dongting Lake together. The 89 C-SPM measurements in Poyang and Dongting Lake as well as their corresponding MODIS Terra images were used to calibrate C-SPM retrieval models, and the calibration results showed that the exponential models of MODIS red band and red minus shortwave infrared (SWIR) band at 1240 nm both explained about 76% of the variation of C-SPM of Poyang and Dongting Lake together. When the two models were applied to the validation datasets, the results indicated that the exponential model of red band obtained more stable C-SPM estimations with no bias at a significance level of 0.05 in both lakes. The MODIS red-band-based model achieved acceptable results for estimating C-SPM in both Poyang and Dongting Lake, and it provided a foundation for obtaining comparable spatiotemporal information of C-SPM, which will be helpful for comparing, understanding, managing, and protecting the two aquatic ecosystems.					邬国锋, Guofeng/B-8735-2018; Chen, Fangyuan (Chelsea)/HGD-9678-2022; wang, yihan/HTN-8802-2023; Wu, Guofeng/B-8735-2018; Wang, Jin/P-5458-2019	Wu, Guofeng/0000-0003-2275-6530; Wang, Junjie/0000-0003-4839-7724														2071-1050				AUG	2016	8	8							832	10.3390/su8080832	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8080832													WOS:000382452900130

An episode of persistent chemical stratification (meromixis) was initiated in 1995 and has resulted in depletion of oxygen and accumulation of ammonia and sulfide beneath the chemocline. Although previous studies have documented high bacterial abundances and marked seasonal changes in phytoplankton abundance and community composition, there have been no previous reports on the occurrence of viruses in this unique lake. Based on the high concentrations and diversity of microbial life in this lake, we hypothesized that planktonic viruses are also abundant and diverse. To examine the abundance and distribution of viruses and bacteria, water samples were collected from four stations along 5 to 15 vertical depths at each station. Viral abundance ranged from 1 x 10(8) to 1 x 10(9) mL(-1), among the highest observed in any natural aquatic system examined so far. Increases (p < 0.1) in viral densities were observed in the anoxic bottom water at multiple stations. However, regression analysis indicated that viral abundance could not be predicted by any single environmental parameter. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed a diverse viral community in Mono Lake with genome sizes ranging from similar to 14 to >400 kb with most of the DNA in the 30 to 60 kb size range. Cluster analysis grouped the anoxic bottom-water viral community into a unique cluster differentiating it from surface and mid-water viral communities. A hybridization study using an indigenous viral isolate as a probe revealed an episodic pattern of temporal phage distribution with strong niche stratification between oxic and anoxic waters.

Developing biomonitoring protocols for shallow Arctic lakes using diatoms and artificial substrate samplers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Growing concerns over effects of climate warming and other stressors on shallow Arctic lakes and ponds stimulate the need to develop and implement effective protocols to track changes in ecological integrity. This study assesses seasonal and spatial variability of periphytic diatom communities in a shallow Arctic lake in northern Yukon Territory to establish biomonitoring protocols. Artificial substrate samplers, which mimic macrophytes, allow direct measurement of biotic responses to shifting environmental conditions and control for possible confounding factors (e.g., accrual time and microhabitat type). Artificial substrate samplers were deployed at three locations and retrieved at three times (early, mid, and late) during the ice-free season. Analyses identified that diatom abundance increased exponentially and community composition changed significantly over the ice-free season, despite little variability in water chemistry, but did not differ among the three sampling locations within the lake. Patterns of seasonal succession in diatom community composition were characterized by first arrival of well-dispersed taxa, which included several planktonic taxa, followed by a transitional phase composed of planktonic and periphytic taxa, and culminated with dominance by periphytic species, mainly Achnanthes minutissima (Kutzing). Results highlight the role of seasonal succession on artificial substrate colonization and the need to deploy artificial substrate samplers for the duration of the ice-free season to capture peak periphytic algal abundance. Low spatial variability of shallow Arctic lakes allows for samplers to be deployed at one single location to characterize diatom community composition.

The flux of settling particles varied from 0.7 mg cm(-2) month(-1) to 14.7 mg cm-2 month-1, and the monthly precipitation ranged from 56 mm to 1218 mm during the survey period. The contributions from typhoon-event precipitation to monthly rainfall amounts were generally larger than 70%. Higher inputs of both particulate and organic carbon into the lake were found during typhoon seasons. Of the annual settling particle loading of 14.9 tons year(-1) to the lake floor, 69% occurred during the typhoon months, and 62% of the annual organic carbon loading of 2.3 tons year(-1) happened during the typhoon months. These results show the importance of typhoon events on the fluxes of settling particles and organic carbon and their delivery to lakes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our goal was to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of the planktic diatom community in the Cajas Massif in the tropical Andes.We analysed seasonal diatom and environmental data over a period of 1 year from 10 lakes located in geologically distinct basins and modelled community-environment relationships using multivariate ordination and variation partitioning techniques. Generalised additive models with a full-subset information theoretic approach also were used to determine which environmental variables explain single-species abundance.Although the lakes are monomictic and thus have variable thermal structure across the year, seasonal variability of water chemistry conditions was negligible, and seasonal differences in diatom community composition were small. Across space, diatom community composition was correlated primarily with ionic content (divalent cations and alkalinity), related to bedrock composition, and secondly with lake thermal structure and productivity. The ionic gradient overrode the effect of the thermal structure-productivity gradient at the diatom community level, whereas individual diatom species responded more sensitively to variables related to in-lake and catchment productivity, including chlorophyll-a and iron, and the proportion of wetlands in the catchment.Our results indicate that the spatiotemporal variability of Cajas lakes and their diatom communities is the result of multiple intertwined environmental factors. The emergence of the ionic and thermal structure-productivity gradients in a rather small tropical lake district suggests segregation of ecological niches for diatoms that also may be important in other high-elevation lake regions. Future studies that track tropical Andean lakes under natural and anthropogenically mediated change, both in contemporary times and in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, would benefit from the modelling approach (community and species levels) developed here.

In situ voltammetric analyses show that free Fe(II) as [Fe(H2O)(6)](2+) or free H2S asH(2)S/HS- are either not present or at trace levels and that iron-rich sulfide complexes are present. From the in situ data and total Fe(II) and H2S measurements, we infer that these iron-rich sulfide complexes may have stoichiometries such as Fe2SH3+ (or polymeric forms of this and other stoichiometries). These iron-rich sulfide complexes appear related to dissolution of the iron-rich FeS mineral, mackinawite, because IAP calculations on data from discrete bottle samples obtained from bottom waters are similar to the pK(sp) of mackinawite. Soluble iron-sulfide species are stable in the absence of O-2 (both in lake waters and the pipeline) and transported several miles during power generation. However, iron-sulfide complexes can react with O-2 to oxidize sulfide and can also dissociate releasing volatile H2S when the waters containing them are exposed to the atmosphere downstream of the power plant. Sediment analyses show that the lake is rich in oxidized iron solids (both crystalline and amorphous). Fe concentrations in FeS solids are low (<5 mu mole/gr(dry wt)) and the pyrite concentration ranges from about equal to the solid FeS to 30 times the solid FeS concentration. The degree of pyritization is below 0.12 indicating that pyrite formation is limited by free sulfide, which can react with the iron-rich sulfide complexes.					; Glazer, Brian/C-2248-2011; Luther, III, George/A-6384-2008	Luther, George/0000-0002-0780-885X; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				JUN	2003	9	2					87	110																WOS:000220170400002
J	Green, AJ; El Hamzaoui, M; El Agbani, MA; Franchimont, J				Green, AJ; El Hamzaoui, M; El Agbani, MA; Franchimont, J			The conservation status of Moroccan wetlands with particular reference to waterbirds and to changes since 1978	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Morgan made detailed descriptions of 24 major Moroccan wetlands visited in 1978, with a total area of 4529 ha (Morgan, N.C., 1982a. An ecological survey of standing waters in North West Africa: III. Site descriptions for Morocco. Biological Conservation, 24, 161-182.). We revisited these sites, and found that 25% of the wetland area had been destroyed by 1999. This loss was concentrated in wetland types of low salinity (<5 g/l NaCl), with a 98% loss of seasonal mesohaline sites, 41% loss of mountain lakes and 33% loss of seasonal Phragmites/Scirpus lacustris marshes. Surviving mountain lakes showed increased conductivities, suggesting reduced inflow. No loss of area of other wetland types was recorded, although degradation has occurred at all sites due to hydrological impacts, overgrazing or excessive reed-cutting, sedimentation, urban development, pollution, introduction of exotic fish and other causes. Similar threats face another 23 major Moroccan wetlands reviewed in this study. Of the 47 wetlands studied in total, only 10 have some kind of protection status. We assess the importance of these wetlands for waterbirds and aquatic submerged or floating plants, The number of plant species recorded is strongly correlated with the number of threatened waterbird species (but not the total number of waterbird species). Natural, freshwater wetlands most affected by wetland loss hold more species of aquatic plants and invertebrates, and are of great value for threatened waterbirds such as marbled teal (Marmaronetta angustrirostris), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and especially the crested coot (Fulica cristata). Most surviving natural, fresh wetlands are unprotected, and measures to conserve them are urgently required. Human-made wetlands such as reservoirs have some value for threatened waterbirds (especially ruddy shelduck and marbled teal), but hold much lower densities of waterbirds than natural wetlands, and support fewer plant species. Thus, they do not compensate for the continuing loss of natural wetlands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phenological synchrony between the austral thrush Turdus falcklandii (Passeriformes: Turdidae) and its food resources within forests and prairies in southern Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Background: Frugivorous birds are phenologically linked to the fruits that they eat. When there is less fruit in seasonal environments, frugivorous birds complement their diet by eating invertebrates. The depth of the phenological link between frugivorous birds and their dietary resources has not been studied until now. The objective was to determine the possible phenological synchrony between the Austral thrush (Turdus falcklandii) and its dietary resource, fruits and annelids, found in the fragmented forests in the South of Chile. Results: The numbers of thrushes, annelids, and fruits in fragments of native forest and anthropogenic grassland in Chile's Lake District were estimated annually. Spatial variation (i.e., forest and grassland) and seasonal variation (i.e., the period of greatest fruit growth and least fruit growth) on thrushes, annelids, and fruits were analyzed with a nonparametric Scheirer-Ray-Hare extension for the Kruskal-Wallis test. The graphic representation of the seasonal variation of thrushes, annelids, and fruits was carried out using cubic spline routines. It was found that there are seasonal changes in the dietary resources of these birds. During the period of greatest fruit production, there was a trend towards a higher number of thrushes in the forest where there was a greater availability of ripe fruit in relation to the nearby grasslands. In the grasslands, the annelids demonstrated a trend towards greater quantities in comparison with the forest. There was a positive and significant correlation between the thrushes and the annelids and fruits, indicating phenological synchrony between this bird and its dietary resources. Conclusions: Therefore, we concluded that the thrush responded numerically and functionally to the variations in its resources. The result of our research underlines the importance of grasslands in maintaining thrush populations, with this bird acting as one of the most important seed dispersers in the temperate southern forests of Chile.					; Rau, Jaime/A-4922-2012	Gantz, Alberto/0000-0003-3304-0802; 													0716-078X	0717-6317				SEP 3	2014	87								11	10.1186/s40693-014-0011-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40693-014-0011-5													WOS:000342660100001

The appearance of varves may also be influenced by chemical processes. We assessed the role of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) in the appearance of varves in sediments from Lake Nylandssjon in northern Sweden. We surveyed Fe in the lake water and established whether there is internal transport of Fe within the sediment. We used a unique collection of seven stored freeze cores of varved sediment from the lake, collected from 1979 to 2004. This suite of cores made it possible to follow long-term changes in Fe and S in the sediment caused by processes that occur in the lake bottom when the sediment is ageing. We compared Fe and S concentrations using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) in specific years in the different cores. No diagenetic front was found in the sediment and the data do not suggest that there is substantial vertical transport of Fe and S in the sediment. We also modeled Fe and S based on thermodynamic, limnological, and sediment data from the lake. The model was limited to the five components H+, e(-), Fe3+, SO4 (2-), H2CO3 and included the formation of solid phases such as Fe(OH)(3) (amorphous), FeOOH (aged, microcrystalline), FeS and FeCO3. Modeling showed that there are pe (redox) ranges within which either FeS or Fe(OH)(3)/FeOOH is the only solid phase present and there are pe ranges within which the two solid phases co-exist, which supports the hypothesis that blackish and grey-brownish layers that occur in the varves were formed at the time of deposition. This creates new possibilities for deciphering high-temporal-resolution environmental information from varves.					; Martinez Cortizas, Antonio/M-6196-2015; Martínez-Cortizas, Antonio/M-6196-2015	Bindler, Richard/0000-0002-7900-309X; Martinez Cortizas, Antonio/0000-0003-0430-5760; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2009	42	1					141	153		10.1007/s10933-008-9267-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9267-6													WOS:000266911700010

Condition and diet of yellow perch in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron (1970-2011)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) constitute an ecologically important component of the ecosystem and support both recreational and commercial fisheries. Over the past 40 years, Saginaw Bay has experienced multiple ecosystem-level changes (e.g., non-indigenous species introductions, reduced nutrient loading and variable temperatures). In turn, abundances and growth rates of yellow perch and their predators and prey have fluctuated. Recent changes to Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron foodwebs have potential to influence prey composition and subsequently, growth and condition for yellow perch; but a complete description of yellow perch diet composition across seasons has not been undertaken in recent years. We calculated mean relative weight (We), an index of condition, of age-1 and older yellow perch in Saginaw Bay annually for 1970-2011. We found high interannual variation in condition and documented low mean We during 1978-1991. We developed regression models to explain this variation using phosphorus load, temperature, forage fish density, and yellow perch density as potential explanatory factors. Patterns of We were associated with changes in yellow perch densities, although interannual variation was not significantly associated with any of the available explanatory variables. Diet analysis of yellow perch collected in 2009 and 2010 demonstrated that age-1 and older yellow perch consumed a fundamentally different diet from a previous study (1986-1988), exhibiting a greater reliance on non-indigenous prey (e.g. Bythotrephes longimanus).

Analysis of the reproductive strategy of Jenynsia multidentata (Cyprinodontiformes, Anablepidae) with focus on sexual differences in growth, size, and abundance	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Jenynsia multidentata is one of the most abundant freshwater fishes in the subtropical region of South America and when abundant it appears to have a major impact on lake ecosystems function. We studied the life-history traits and population structure of J. multidentata in a shallow lake in Uruguay, and collected literature data along a subtropical to tropical freshwater gradient in South America. Our general focus was on reproductive strategy, particularly on sexual differences in growth, size and abundance. In Lake Blanca, we found strong reverse size dimorphism (RSD) and a feminized sex ratio. Both are attributed to sexual differences in growth patterns and longevity. RSD and a feminized sex ratio seem to characterise J. multidentata regardless of latitude, and together with other life traits such as small size, rapid growth, low age of maturity, the capacity of the females to keep sperm alive to fertilize several successive litters, high natural mortality and fertility, resistance to extreme environmental conditions and omnivory, they are indicative of high productivity to biomass ratio. The very high population growth rate helps to explain why fish removal, aiming to promote an increase in the zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton, may not be a useful tool in eutrophic-turbid subtropical South American lakes. We also found that the duration of the breeding season deviated markedly with latitude, increasing towards the tropics, which may have major consequences for population growth rates and differential impact of this species on lake ecosystems in the different climate zones.

J	De Cesare, G; Schleiss, A; Hermann, F				De Cesare, G; Schleiss, A; Hermann, F			Impact of turbidity currents on reservoir sedimentation	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE												All lakes created on natural rivers are subjected to reservoir sedimentation. The construction of a dam significantly modifies the flow conditions of natural streams inside and downstream of an artificial lake. The sediment concentration is often high during the flood season, and the entering flow shows a greater density than the ambient fluid. Suspended load can therefore be carried along the reservoir bottom to the dam in the form of turbidity currents. This paper presents research results that help to better understand this physical phenomenon, which contributes to reservoir sedimentation. It is based on in situ measurements, a laboratory scale model of turbidity currents and numerical flow simulations. The study of a thousand-year flood in the Luzzone Reservoir in the Swiss Alps using the developed computer model revealed the potential of such a tool. In particular, the impact on the sediment deposits was analyzed. A valuable evaluation of the incidence of such a turbidity flow is presented and its effects are compared to observations. Significant progress has been made in understanding the importance of turbidity currents in reservoir sedimentation.					de Cesare, Giampiero/I-2801-2014	De Cesare, Giovanni/0000-0002-1117-3180													0733-9429					JAN	2001	127	1					6	16		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2001)127:1(6)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2001)127:1(6)													WOS:000165874000001
J	Busch, S; Kirillin, G; Mehner, T				Busch, Susan; Kirillin, Georgiy; Mehner, Thomas			Plasticity in habitat use determines metabolic response of fish to global warming in stratified lakes	OECOLOGIA												We used a coupled lake physics and bioenergetics-based foraging model to evaluate how the plasticity in habitat use modifies the seasonal metabolic response of two sympatric cold-water fishes (vendace and Fontane cisco, Coregonus spp.) under a global warming scenario for the year 2100. In different simulations, the vertically migrating species performed either a plastic strategy (behavioral thermoregulation) by shifting their population depth at night to maintain the temperatures occupied at current in-situ observations, or a fixed strategy (no thermoregulation) by keeping their occupied depths at night but facing modified temperatures. The lake physics model predicted higher temperatures above 20 m and lower temperatures below 20 m in response to warming. Using temperature-zooplankton relationships, the density of zooplankton prey was predicted to increase at the surface, but to decrease in hypolimnetic waters. Simulating the fixed strategy, growth was enhanced only for the deeper-living cisco due to the shift in thermal regime at about 20 m. In contrast, simulating the plastic strategy, individual growth of cisco and young vendace was predicted to increase compared to growth currently observed in the lake. Only growth rates of older vendace are reduced under future global warming scenarios irrespective of the behavioral strategy. However, performing behavioral thermoregulation would drive both species into the same depth layers, and hence will erode vertical microhabitat segregation and intensify inter-specific competition between the coexisting coregonids.

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Limnothrissa miodon, a small pelagic clupeid fish introduced at the end of the 1950s into Lake Kivu, became an important resource for the human populations of this area. The total stock of pelagic fish populations of this lake was estimated in 2008 by two hydroacoustic surveys, using an EK60 split-beam sounder (frequency 70 kHz). The total fish stocks were estimated to be approximately 5000 t in the rainy season and 6000 tons in the dry season. These values are similar to previous estimations performed in the 1980s. During 2008, the stock did not fluctuate throughout the seasons; however, the spatial distributions were different in the two hydrological seasons. Interestingly, the L miodon stock has appeared to remain stable over the last two decades, which suggests that the pelagic fishery in Lake Kivu has not been overexploited and that it is sustainable.

Kolleru Lake, India's largest fresh water body, and Ramsar site have undergone tremendous changes due to the development of aquaculture. To assess the impact of aquaculture on Kolleru, satellite data were found appropriate because of the synoptic-detailed overview and accuracy. Satellite data of IRS 1D, LISS III from 2004 and Survey of India topographic maps from 1967 were processed using image processing techniques in erdas imagine and analysed in Geographical Information System (GIS) such as arc gis 9.1. Land use map prepared from the satellite data was verified in the field using Global Positioning System to check the land and water use classes and its areal extent. It was estimated from the topographic maps of 1967 that the total lake boundary area was 180.38 km(2), in which 70.70 km(2) had water throughout the year and 100.97 km(2) had water during the rainy season. The digital image processing of 2004 satellite data revealed that Kolleru was no longer a lake and the lake area of 62.65 km(2) (34.73%) only remained in a degraded state, extensively colonized by macrophytes. The total loss of lake area was 109.02 km(2) between 1967 and 2004, in which aquaculture was developed in 99.74 km(2), which represented 55.3% of the 1967 lake area. The maximum conversion to aquaculture occurred from the lake liable to be inundated during the 1967 rainy season. The area under agriculture was 16.62 km(2) in 2004, the increase in lake area for agriculture between 1967 and 2004 being 8.22 km(2) (4.55% of lake). If human induced degradation is allowed to continue, the lake will very soon disappear. Now, the Government of Andhra Pradesh, India, has initiated schemes and laws to restore the lake to its pre-development state. Lessons learnt from the Kolleru Lake cautioned that there is a need for regular monitoring of important water resources throughout the world to protect the biodiversity of the earth.																			1355-557X	1365-2109				DEC 1	2006	37	16					1617	1626		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01602.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01602.x													WOS:000242197500002

Genomic profiles of four novel cyanobacteria MAGs from Lake Vanda, Antarctica: insights into photosynthesis, cold tolerance, and the circadian clock	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Cyanobacteria in polar environments face environmental challenges, including cold temperatures and extreme light seasonality with small diurnal variation, which has implications for polar circadian clocks. However, polar cyanobacteria remain underrepresented in available genomic data, and there are limited opportunities to study their genetic adaptations to these challenges. This paper presents four new Antarctic cyanobacteria metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from microbial mats in Lake Vanda in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica. The four MAGs were classified as Leptolyngbya sp. BulkMat.35, Pseudanabaenaceae cyanobacterium MP8IB2.15, Microcoleus sp. MP8IB2.171, and Leptolyngbyaceae cyanobacterium MP9P1.79. The MAGs contain 2.76 Mbp - 6.07 Mbp, and the bin completion ranges from 74.2-92.57%. Furthermore, the four cyanobacteria MAGs have average nucleotide identities (ANIs) under 90% with each other and under 77% with six existing polar cyanobacteria MAGs and genomes. This suggests that they are novel cyanobacteria and demonstrates that polar cyanobacteria genomes are underrepresented in reference databases and there is continued need for genome sequencing of polar cyanobacteria. Analyses of the four novel and six existing polar cyanobacteria MAGs and genomes demonstrate they have genes coding for various cold tolerance mechanisms and most standard circadian rhythm genes with the Leptolyngbya sp. BulkMat.35 and Leptolyngbyaceae cyanobacterium MP9P1.79 contained kaiB3, a divergent homolog of kaiB.					; Sumner, Dawn/E-8744-2011	, Eduardo Alatorre-Acevedo/0009-0001-8875-2172; Lumian, Jessica/0000-0002-6604-4618														1664-302X				JAN 11	2024	14								1330602	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1330602	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1330602								38282730					WOS:001148224200001

The DOC concentrations and its seasonal variation were discussed by correlating with the rainfall, water temperature, and pH of lake water. The results showed that the weekly DOC varied from 8.15 to 32.65 mg/L with an annual average concentration of 17.96 mg/L. There was a significant difference in the average DOC concentrations between the rainy and dry seasons as the monthly average DOC concentration was 21.72 mg/L for the wet season compared to the dry season concentration of 14.21 mg/L. The rainfall shows a significant effect on the DOC concentration of lake water, as DOC concentration was much high during the wet season. There were no significant spatial variations in the average monthly concentration among the four sampling locations except occasional variation during the wet season. The reason for the wet season DOC differences among four sampling locations is likely due to the uneven runoff and underground water inputs and the relatively slow circulation of lake water. Finally, the seasonal fluctuation of DOC concentration in this closed lake water suggests that dissolved soil organic matter inputs through the rainfall related to surface runoff and subsurface infiltration from the surrounding watershed land is important to the primary production and organic matter deposition in the lake sediments.

Declining North American snow cover ablation frequency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												At a continental scale, trends in aggregate ablation frequency inform changes in snow cover extent, however the variability and trends in the frequency and magnitude of snow ablation events at regional scales are less well understood. Determining such variability is critical in describing regional hydroclimate, where snow ablation can influence streamflow, soil moisture and groundwater supplies. This study uses a gridded dataset of United States and Canadian snow ablation events derived from 1960 to 2009 surface observations to examine spatial and temporal variations of snow ablation frequency. Here, we show a relatively narrow band of peak ablation frequency seasonally advances and recedes over North America, forced by variations in snow depth and meteorological conditions suitable for ablation. Particularly in more moist regions away from the continent's interior, hydrologically relevant ablation events of at least 10.0 cm occur on an approximately yearly basis. Collectively, ablation events became significantly less frequent with time, where events specifically in the Appalachians and in Great Lakes regions declined by as much as 75% over the 50-year period. Decreases in ablation frequency across the study region are primarily driven by significant decreases in snow cover, inhibiting the potential for ablation to occur due to a lack of sufficiently deep snowpacks. These results point to important snow cover related changes in the hydrologic cycle in a warming climate and highlight specific areas of interest where more localized analysis of ablation trends and forcing mechanisms would be appropriate.					; Mote, Thomas/U-6681-2017; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Robinson, David/0000-0002-2954-3717; Wachowicz, Lori/0000-0001-5483-0462; Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; Suriano, Zachary/0000-0001-7574-0191													0899-8418	1097-0088				SEP	2021	41	11					5213	5225		10.1002/joc.7125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7125		APR 2021											WOS:000638307300001

The extraglacial lake sediments provide the first records of late Saalian cladoceran communities in central Europe, recovered from glaciolacustrine deposits. Sedimentation was dominated by a supply of clastics that fluctuated with the seasons, forming rhythmites. In addition to seasonal cyclicity, sedimentary and environmental conditions changed every several years to decades, with periods of increased inflow to the lake delivering sandy material, and periods of almost stagnant water dominated by suspension settling. The sediments contain Cladocera assemblages that indicate the lake was initially deep, oligotrophic, and filled with moderately cold water. Changes in Cladocera community composition and abundance were perhaps responses to climate seasonality. Zones without Cladocera were associated with seasons of higher inflow and sediment supply, and directly or indirectly, with tectonic activity in the graben. Earthquakes, documented by the presence of seismites, caused not only deformation of unconsolidated lake-bottom sediments, but possibly also changes in habitat characteristics. Combined sedimentological and biological data were used to infer the lake's history and show that deposits of glaciolacustrine lakes can be used as indicators of past ecological and climate changes.					; Gruszka, Beata/F-7962-2011; Pawlowski, Dominik/KCZ-1312-2024	Petera-Zganiacz, Joanna/0000-0002-1045-5506; Pawlowski, Dominik/0000-0003-4616-6666													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2013	49	4					679	696		10.1007/s10933-013-9692-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9692-z													WOS:000316888900010

Sampling was performed year round. 112 cultures were isolated and divided into classes by phenotype and then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics identified eleven different bacterial groups (A to K), and the results showed that the isolates represented seven genera: Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Carnobacterium, Streptococcus, and Weissella. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the most abundant lactic acid bacteria found in these lakes. Furthermore, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also the most abundant lactic acid bacteria found throughout the year.

Limnocythere inopinata is a new record for the Bolu region. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ( CCA) explained 73% of the correlation between species and environmental variables, suggesting that the occurrence of many species is temporally variable, and is related to seasonal changes in physicochemical conditions. The four most frequently occurring cosmopolitan ostracod species ( Candona neglecta, Darwinula stevensoni, Physocypria kraepelini, and Cypridopsis vidua) accounted for more than 70% of the species recorded. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen ( DO), and redox potential were the most affective variables on the species occurrence.Two species (C.vidua, I.bradyi) were positively correlated to redox potential, while such a correlation was negative for P. kraepelini. The most frequently occurring species C. neglecta was most closely related to the changes in redox potential, whereas C. vidua and D.stevensoni showed a positive correlation to water temperature. Negative strong correlation (p< 0.01) was found between pH and I. bradyi, but correlation was positive and weak for C. vidua. Some species ( e. g. L. inopinata) showed no clear relationship with any of those environmental variables. UPGMA clustering of species based on their occurrence in different. ecological conditions revealed three main species assemblages.

Both host water and molluscan growth increments show more than 8parts per thousand seasonal variation in delta(18)O. In the floodplain lake under study the delta(18)O variation of the water is controlled by contrasting dry and wet season evaporation-precipitation regimes. Molluscan delta(18)O appears to be in equilibrium with the host water. Although an approximately 4.0parts per thousand offset occurs, delta(13)O records of water and bivalves are in good agreement, suggesting that both delta(18)O and delta(13)O of the shells of freshwater bivalve A. trapesialis are good recorders of (palaeo-)environmental conditions. The delta(13)O of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) is governed by plant growth and/or by changes in aquatic chemistry, affecting the DIC pool. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Aquatic environments integrate multiple sources and processes over space and time that influence ecosystem functionality. The complexity of these systems and their multiple interactions with the surrounding environment are conceptualised, but often lack empirical scrutiny that allows further understanding of how inland waters mobilise, transport, and utilise carbon and nutrients. This is particularly evident in tropical waters. Here, we apply advanced geochemical analyses of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in conjunction with algal pigment biomarkers, to determine the seasonal variability of organic matter production, processing and export for a tropical, floodpulse wetland, Tasik Chini (Malaysia). We identify two phases in the hydrological cycle: Phase 1 signifying a transition from the wet season with high suspended sediment and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. DOM is composed of humic substances, building blocks and lower molecular weight compounds. Towards the end this phase then are periods of increased water clarity and algal productivity. This is followed by Phase 2, which has a greater contribution of autochthonous DOM, composed of proteinaceous material, concomitant with lower dissolved nutrient concentrations, increased mixotrophic algae and emergent vegetation. Based on this framework, we highlight the role of such tropical wetland lakes as hydrological "bottlenecks," through a lentic/lotic switch that shifts aquatic transport of carbon and nutrients from lateral river continuum supply to flood pulses. We highlight the need to consider inherent biases of spatial and temporal scaling when examining freshwater ecosystems along the land-ocean aquatic continuum.

Dietary fatty acid transfer in pelagic food webs across trophic and climatic differences of Chinese lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In eutrophic lake ecosystems, cyanobacteria typically lead to unbalanced phytoplankton community structure and low dietary quality for consumers at higher trophic levels. However, it still remains poorly understood how zooplankton manage to respond to seasonal and spatial differences in lake trophic gradients and temperature factors to retain highly required dietary nutrients from phytoplankton. In this field study, we investigated seston and different size classes of zooplankton of temperate and subtropical large lakes of different trophic conditions in China. We used fatty acids (FA) as dietary nutrients from seston to zooplankton to investigate how eutrophication affects the FA composition of various zooplankton size classes. This study revealed a curvilinear relationship between total phosphorus (TP) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contents of edible phytoplankton ("seston") across 3 seasons and 2 climatic areas. The PUFA content of seston increased until mesotrophic lake conditions (TP: 11-20 mu g L-1), after which the dietary provision of PUFA for respective consumers declined. Seston FA, rather than trophic condition or water temperature, primarily predicted changes in zooplankton FA, while this predictive power decreased with zooplankton size. Despite increasing eutrophic lake conditions, LC-PUFA content of the zooplankton consistently increased per unit biomass. The results indicate that the nutritional value of phytoplankton was highest in mesotrophic lakes, and lake zooplankton selectively increased their LC-PUFA retention with body size and/or were able to convert dietary FA endogenously to meet their size -specific FA demands, independent of lake location or time (season) or the measured trophic condition of the lake (from oligoto eutrophic).					; Zhang, Yinzhe/HKN-8253-2023; FENG, Kai/KIK-8485-2024; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021	Feng, Kai/0000-0001-6072-8763; Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 25	2024	913								169562	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169562		JAN 2024						38142998					WOS:001158131400001
J	Peters, L; Traunspurger, W				Peters, L; Traunspurger, W			Species distribution of free-living nematodes and other meiofauna in littoral periphyton communities of lakes	NEMATOLOGY												Recent studies on meiofaunal and nematode communities have focused on soft sediments in streams, lakes and marine environments. Despite a large number of studies dealing with periphyton, meiofaunal and nematode communities, on littoral hard substrates in lakes have not yet been investigated in detail. Therefore, epilithic communities with particular emphasis on nematode species composition, were analysed in 17 Swedish lakes differing greatly in size, depth, trophic status and epilithic biomass. Nematode abundance ranged from 2.3 to 161.5 cm(-2), and the abundance of nematodes relative to total meiofauna ranged from 20 to 77% (mean 53%). Fifty-eight nematode species were identified; species numbers varied from eight to 34 species per lake. The dominant species were Rhabdolaimus aquaticus, Punctodora ratzeburgensis, Eumonhystera dispar and Crocodorylaimus flavomaculatus. Deposit feeders dominated (71% of total fauna), followed by suction feeders (14%), epistrate feeders (12%) and chewers (3%). Of 3624 nematodes examined, 54% were juveniles, 35% females, 6% males and 5% gravid females. Multivariate analysis of the nematode species composition revealed significant differences in the community structures among lakes. This is the first study to show that meiofauna is a numerically abundant group within littoral periphyton communities in lakes, with nematodes representing the dominant group.

Dynamics of artisanal fisheries in two Brazilian Amazonian reserves: implications to co-management	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In this study we compare the dynamics of artisanal fishery in two adjacent reserves located in the Brazilian Amazon, Mamiraua (being managed for more than 12 years) and Amana (initiating a management process), through the record of 485 fish landings in one fishing community in each reserve during high and low water seasons in 2003. Our goals were, first, to make a rapid and comparative assessment of some main aspects of fisheries in these two communities (fish species caught, CPUE, fishing gear and habitats exploited). Second, we used such data to evaluate if management strategies already in place in Mamiraua would be also valid for Amana . Third, we compared fishing CPUE between the two communities, in order to check if co-management measures have contributed, at least partially, to preclude over-fishing, maintaining a higher fishing reward in Mamiraua reserve. We analyzed fisheries directed to the two most important marketable fishes in the region: the pirarucu (Arapaimas gigas) and the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), besides those fisheries aimed to subsistence and lower valued fishes. Our results indicated that the tambaqui was intensively fished year-round in Mamiraua, while Amana fishers caught a higher variety of fishes, including catfishes and migratory scale fishes. Such differences might reflect differences in gear used and habitat exploited by fishers during the high water season. Mamiraua fishers caught a higher fish biomass considering both marketable and all fishes. Differences in gear used, habitats exploited and fishes caught during high water season indicate that distinct management initiatives might apply for each reserve. Notwithstanding their differences, both communities exploited the commercial fishes (tambaqui and pirarucu) in a similar way during the low water season. Therefore, the higher mean fishing yield (CPUE) observed in Mamiraua may be partially attributable to co-management measures, considering that Mamiraua has possibly been experiencing a higher fishing intensity than Amana . Fishing related data are seldom available in Brazil and other tropical developing countries. We thus provided a framework of fast assessment of fishing dynamics, which may represent a first and useful step for management initiatives in the absence of more detailed data.

Ice cover and sea level of the Aral Sea from satellite altimetry and radiometry (1992-2006)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												We discuss recent seasonal and interannual variations of ice cover and lake surface level in the Aral Sea from satellite data for 1992-2006. First, we provide an overview of the evolution of the Aral Sea's environmental conditions, hydrological and ice regime, existing observations and current state of the scientific research. Desiccation of the Aral Sea led to disappearance of the infrastructure in the coastal zone, including meteorological and sea level gauge stations. The current lack of reliable in-situ measurements and time series for sea level and ice cover parameters since mid-1980s can be partly overcome with radar altimeter and microwave satellite observations that provide reliable, frequent, regular and weather-independent data. In our study, we use radar altimeter data from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, ENVISAT and GFO satellites, as well as the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) radiometer. An ice discrimination method, based on the synergy of active and passive data from the four altimetric missions and SSM/I, is proposed and applied to the entire satellite dataset to define the specific dates of ice events for 1992-2006. We then analyse the evolution of the sea level in the Large and Small Aral sea and Sarykamysh lake. For this purpose, we compare time series from several sources (Hydroweb, USDA Reservoir Database, Integrated Satellite Altimetry Data Base and others), perform an intercomparison of the available observations and discuss the reasons for potential differences. Using the data from the four altimetric retrackers for ENVISAT we also estimate how the presence of ice could affect the altimeter range measures. We estimate the associated uncertainties and provide recommendations for adjusting sea level time series for altimeters where only ocean retracker (T/P, Jason-1, GFO) is present.

J	Vermaat, JE; Santamaria, L; Roos, PJ				Vermaat, JE; Santamaria, L; Roos, PJ			Water flow across and sediment trapping in submerged macrophyte beds of contrasting growth form	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Patterns of wave amplitudes, linear flow velocity, turbidity, sedimentation and periphyton accumulation were quantified across two macrophyte beds of contrasting architecture and adjacent unvegetated sediments, in Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands. Within both a Chara aspera- and an Alisma gramineum-dominated bed, wave amplitudes were progressively reduced. Vertical profiles of linear velocity in the two vegetations were significantly different from each other and from profiles measured outside the vegetation. Compared to unvegetated profiles, flow over the Chara-bed was more rapid in the upper 20 cm of the water but then dropped rapidly. In Alisma, maximum velocity at the surface was already lower than outside the vegetation. The denser Alisma-bed had a higher biomass (125 +/- 15 g AFDW m(-2), mean +/- standard error) than the Chara-bed (28 +/- 1), it filled the whole water column, and rapidly reduced light attenuation (K-d) from 6.4 +/- 1.4 outside to 2.3 +/- 0.3 m(-1) within the vegetation. Also in the Chara-bed, light attenuation and sedimentation rates were significantly reduced (light attenuation: 1.2 +/- 0.1 versus 2.7 +/- 0.1 m(-1); sedimentation: 2.6 +/- 0.3 versus 7.7 +/- 0.5 mg dry weight cm(-2) d(-1), averaged over the growing season). The dense Chara vegetation of 10-20 cm height effectively lifted the resuspensive turbulent shear stress above the sediment surface, thereby trapping settled material.

Novel aspects of stocked juvenile steelhead emigration patterns as revealed using dual-frequency identification sonar	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We used a Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) near the mouth of a small Lake Erie tributary to monitor juvenile steelhead emigration. Data were recorded continuously over two stocking seasons (April-May 2014; April June 2015) and total emigration counts were determined every hour. Fish lengths at time of emigration were estimated using the DIDSON fish measuring tool and quantified through time. Percent survival to emigration was high with >71% of individuals reaching the river mouth in both years. Photoperiod was the best predictor of peak emigration timing, and steelhead were most likely to emigrate at night. Larger individuals were more likely to emigrate shortly after stocking; however, the size range of fish that emigrated throughout the study period was wide. Residual population estimates performed after the DIDSON sampling period revealed that in both years <6% of the steelhead that were stocked remained in Trout Run by the end of June, >2 months after stocking. Most of these fish (63%) were <150 mm TL, below the typical size threshold for steelhead to emigrate. These findings provide useful information on the survivorship and residence time of stocked juvenile steelhead and indicate that multiple factors, including photoperiod and length at stocking, should be considered when determining best practices.

ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												This paper aims to compare alpha and beta diversities of planktonic microcrustaceans from three reservoirs located nearby in a tropical semiarid basin. Our hypothesis was that alpha and beta diversities of the community are different, although the ecosystems are located close to each other. We carried out two sampling campaigns: dry and rainy seasons. The sampling of microcrustaceans and environmental variables (dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a and nutrient) was performed at twelve stations and were distributed throughout the three zones (river, transition, and lacustrine), using a plankton net (45 mu m). The reservoirs showed different uses and types of nitrogen predominance: Cachoeira (supply/nitrate), Borborema (sewage/ammonia) and Saco (aquaculture/ammonia). Seventeen species were recorded whose richness was assessed as particularly specific to each one of the studied reservoirs. Seasonally, both reservoirs with high anthropogenic alteration showed greater richness in the dry season. The three reservoirs located in a same basin showed different richness and composition, but the diversity did not differ between the zones of the reservoirs. Although communities are close to each other, their composition and richness were found to be distinct for each reservoir. This may be in response to the peculiar particularities, such as nitrogen sources and the different uses.

PREFERRED ORIENTATION PATTERNS OF PHYLLOSILICATES IN SURFACE CLAYS	CLAYS AND CLAY MINERALS												The alignment of phyllosilicates in clays has received a lot of attention because it is a major cause of seismic anisotropy in the Earth's crust. Thus far, all attention has been on shales where the orientation pattern has been attributed to compaction and observed to increase with burial depth and diagenetic processes. Here, for the first time, the same methods that were developed to quantify shale preferred orientation were applied to clays forming in surface environments, a seasonal streambed in Death Valley, California; a mudpool from mud volcanoes in Imperial Valley, California, close to the Salton Sea; and a glacial lake from Val Albigna in the Swiss Alps. Preferred orientation was analyzed quantitatively with high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction. All three samples showed strong alignment of phyllosilicates with (001) pole figure maxima 2-4 multiples of a random distribution, comparable to shales, and indicating that significant preferred orientation can be produced at surface conditions. The original alignment during sedimentation may be an important factor for the final microstructure in many shales.

Nutrient cycling and retention along a littoral gradient in a Dutch shallow lake in relation to water level regime	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Littoral zones are characterized by gradients in depth and vegetation biomass, influencing nutrient retention capacity. A field experiment was conducted in a Phragmites australis dominated littoral zone to investigate nutrient retention and its effect on surface water quality. Measurements were done in mesocosms where water levels could be manipulated. Nutrient status was investigated along a gradient perpendicular to the shore during two growing seasons, one with a stable water level and one with a gradually decreasing water level. Nutrient concentrations in sediment, soil pore water and surface water were significantly lower in the vegetated than in the unvegetated zone. The negative correlations of nutrients in sediment and water, with nutrient contents of the vegetation suggest a direct effect of the vegetation. Nutrient uptake and biomass of the vegetation was higher in continuously flooded soils than in seasonally emerging sediments higher along the littoral gradient, probably due to the increased salinity in drained zones. Denitrification rate was highest in the unvegetated zone and was positively related to water level. Flooded littoral zones did result in a higher nutrient retention than drained zones. On small scale, for an optimal nutrient retention a fluctuating regime is not necessarily better suited than a stable water level, but on a larger scale it can substantially increase the width of the vegetated zone. It is important to optimize conditions for helophyte growth since the positive effect of vegetation on nutrient retention, at least at local scale, has been demonstrated in this study.

J	Vos, RJ; Hakvoort, JHM; Jordans, RWJ; Ibelings, BW				Vos, RJ; Hakvoort, JHM; Jordans, RWJ; Ibelings, BW			Multiplatform optical monitoring of eutrophication in temporally and spatially variable lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Representative spatial patterns of eutrophication variables cannot be produced using traditional in situ sampling techniques. Spatial heterogeneity complicates the study of seasonal and long-term trends and the evaluation of water management policies. Remote sensing, however, with its broad view has the potential to deliver the relevant information. This paper will address the added value of synoptic eutrophication maps to the standard monitoring program of two large, spatially and temporally variable lakes in the Netherlands, Lakes IJssel and Marken. Remote sensing images were obtained from SeaWiFS; and combined with hyperspectral reflectance data from the airborne EPS-a sensor and the shipboard PR-650 spectroradiometer. The PR-650 data were used in selecting the most appropriate algorithms for ScaWiFS and EPS-a. A special algorithm for case 11 waters with high chlorophyll content was applied to SeaWiFS data to obtain chlorophyll concentrations. Synoptic maps of suspended matter were retrieved using inversion of a model for irradiance reflectance. For the airborne sensor inversion of reflectance was used for both suspended matter and chlorophyll. Satellite and airborne sensors clearly are complementary to each other. Comparison of satellite data with the airborne data and the (scarcely available) in situ data reveal underlying problems with: (i) validation of remote sensing images; and (ii) comparing data at different spatial and temporal scales. In our study, we found a reasonable agreement between different data sources at seasonal time scales, but at shorter time scales the differences can be (much) larger. In situ data suffer from poor reproducibility, related to the natural variability at small spatial scales (patchiness), combined with a significant temporal variability. The standard in situ monitoring program in Lakes IJssel and Marken lacks both the necessary spatial coverage as well as an appropriate sampling frequency. This indicates that for reliable monitoring, a synoptic data set, sampled at a high frequency is required. Remote sensing can partially fulfil this demand but still lacks the demanded frequency, mainly due to regular cloud cover. The answer may be in a multiplatform monitoring approach, as used in our study (combining in situ data with shipboard, airborne and satellite optical data) and in combining monitoring data with models. Satellite remote sensing is most powerful in determining properties that are inherent to the whole take system, like the overall mean chlorophyll-a concentration. Computational models may meet the demand for a sufficiently high sampling frequency by deterministic interpolation of the data in time. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Aeriyanie, AR; Sinang, SC; Nayan, N; Song, HH				Aeriyanie, Amy Rose; Sinang, Som Cit; Nayan, Nasir; Song, Haihong			Comparison of water level and eutrophication indicators during the wet and dry period in a eutrophic urban lake	ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA												Eutrophication modifies lakes' ecological balances and threatens its viability. To date, eutrophication management strategies have been related to nutrient reduction in the lakes' water column. However, nutrient reduction strategies are complicated by the variations of the lake's water level, nutrient concentration, and eutrophication symptom, which are primarily known to be influenced by the local rainfall patterns. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the variability of water level, total phosphorus, and total chlorophyll-a concentrations in Slim River Lake during wet and dry seasons. In this study, water sampling and depth measurements were carried out from six sampling points for 1 year. Water samples were used to quantify total phosphorus and total chlorophyll-a. Our results showed that mean water levels in the studied lake ranged from 1.36 m to 5.46 m in the wet season and from 1.31 m to 5.41 m in the dry season, which implicated no significant difference (p > .05) between seasons in most sampling points. Total phosphorus present at concentrations exceeding 10 mg/L and showed small variations between wet and dry seasons. Mean total phosphorus concentrations varied from 10.55 mg/L to 26.66 mg/L in the wet season and 10.77 mg/L to 21.76 mg/L in the dry season and showed no significant difference between seasons. In addition, mean chlorophyll-a concentrations ranged from 14.35 mg/m(3) to 180.13 mg/m(3) and from 14.15 mg/m(3) to 39.27 mg/m(3) in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Chlorophyll-a concentrations showed significant differences (p < .05) between seasons in the deepest sampling points in the lake. The observed seasonal variations in total chlorophyll-a suggest the importance of algae monitoring during the wet season even when no apparent surge of phosphorus concentration is detected.

Rivers are key elements in these regions since they drain vast land areas and thereby reflect various climatic signals. Zackenberg River in northeast Greenland provides a unique opportunity to study climatic influences on discharge, as the river is not connected to the Greenland ice sheet. The study aims to explain discharge patterns between 1996 and 2019 and analyse the discharge for correlations to variations in air temperature and both solid and liquid precipitation. The results reveal no trend in the annual discharge. A lengthening of the discharge period is characterised by a later freeze-up and extreme discharge peaks are observed almost yearly between 2005 and 2017. A positive correlation exists between the length of the discharge period and the Thawing Degree Days (r=0.52,p<0.01), and between the total annual discharge and the annual maximum snow depth (r=0.48,p=0.02). Thereby, snowmelt provides the main source of discharge in the first part of the runoff season. However, the influence of precipitation on discharge could not be fully identified, because of uncertainties in the data and possible delays in the hydrological system. This calls for further studies on the relationship between discharge and precipitation. The discharge patterns are also influenced by meltwater from the A.P. Olsen ice cap and an adjacent glacier-dammed lake which releases outburst floods. Hence, this mixed hydrological regime causes different relationships between the discharge and climatic trends when compared to most Arctic rivers.

NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The premise of catch-and-release recreational angling is that postrelease survival is high. Therefore, it is common for anglers, management agencies, and conservation organizations to share information on handling practices and other strategies that are believed to improve the welfare and survival of fish that are released. A recent surge in popularity has sensationalized the use of carbonated beverages to treat bleeding fish-an intervention that is purported to stop bleeding but has yet to be validated scientifically. We captured Northern Pike Esox lucius via hook and line and experimentally injured their gills in a standardized manner. Gill injuries were treated with Mountain Dew, Coca-Cola, or carbonated lake water. The duration and intensity of bleeding as well as overall blood loss (using gill color as a proxy) were observed while the fish were held in a lake water bath. As a control, we used a group of experimentally injured fish that did not have liquid poured over their gills before the observation period. All treatments and the control were conducted at two different water temperatures (11-18 degrees C and 24-27 degrees C) to determine whether the effects of pouring carbonated beverages over injured gills are seasonally dependent. When compared to the control, we found that the duration and intensity of bleeding increased regardless of the type of carbonated beverage used in this study, and there was no effect of season. Use of chilled versus ambient-temperature beverages similarly had no influence on outcomes. As such, there is no scientific evidence to support the use of carbonated beverages for reducing or stopping blood loss in fish that receive gill injuries during recreational angling based on the context studied here. Our study reinforces the need to scientifically test angler anecdotes and theories regarding best practices for catch-and-release fishing.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Lawrence, Michael/AAC-9979-2019	Reid, Connor/0000-0001-9431-9044; Chhor, Auston/0000-0003-1785-4902; Lawrence, Michael/0000-0002-4801-1580; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Trahan, Alexandria/0000-0003-3556-0895													0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2021	41	3					639	649		10.1002/nafm.10571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10571		MAR 2021											WOS:000635436600001
J	Asquith, NM; Mejía-Chang, M				Asquith, NM; Mejía-Chang, M			Mammals, edge effects, and the loss of tropical forest diversity	ECOLOGY												Relative to the surrounding mainland forests, a subset of tree species dominates wind-exposed, forested islands in Gatun Lake, Panama. We explored how tree diversity in these fragments has been affected by (1) impoverishment of the mammal community and (2) changes in abiotic conditions following island formation ca. 90 years ago. To test effects of changes in the mammal community, we assessed seed and seedling survival for nine tree species in five forests: small islands with no mammals; small islands with spiny rats but no larger mammals; medium islands (intermediate mammal community); Barro Colorado Island (intermittently present puma and jaguar); and mainland forests (intact mammal community). To test effects of abiotic stress, we chose experimental sites at wind-exposed, wind-protected, and interior forest sites. We predicted that fragments with less diverse mammal communities would be characterized by (1) fewer seeds dispersed and cached, (2) lower long-term seed survival, and (3) higher rates of seedling herbivory by mammals. Where alteration of the environment has caused greater exposure to dry-season winds, we predicted that (4) germination and seedling establishment and (5) dry-season seedling survival would be low. Further, we expected that (6) dry-season seedling survival would increase if soil moisture levels were raised, but that (7) wet-season seedling survival is independent of wind exposure. In the larger forests, seed and seedling survival were low, and differences in mammal community composition had little effect. Small islands that supported only rats had the same low seed survival as larger forests. Elimination of all mammals resulted in much higher seed survival, and slightly higher seedling survival. Germination and seedling survival were lower at wind-exposed than at protected sites, but irrigation had no effect on dry-season seedling survival. It appears that the dominant species on Gatun Lake fragments have passed through a series of filters: seeds must first avoid being eaten by spiny rats, survive the first dry season, and then avoid seedling herbivory by rats. Biotic and abiotic factors determine seedling survival in tropical forests; synergistic changes in these factors can thus lead to dramatic losses of diversity.																			0012-9658					FEB	2005	86	2					379	390		10.1890/03-0575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-0575													WOS:000227634400015
J	Adamczuk, M				Adamczuk, Malgorzata			The Responses of Cladoceran Communities to the Single and Simultaneous Effects of Environmentally Relevant Increases in Temperature and Phosphorus Concentration in Freshwater Ecosystems	WATER												Environmental changes are important factors related to shifts in species compositions and abundances of aquatic communities. This study presents the responses of cladoceran communities to realistic scenarios of an increase in temperature and phosphorus concentration. This study was conducted under laboratory conditions, and the outcomes of this study explain the causes of seasonal shifts in both abundance and species composition and allow us to predict their responses to climatic changes in aquatic ecosystems. The results showed that temperature increase was the more important trigger of shifts than phosphorus increase. Moreover, the simultaneous influence of increases in temperature and phosphorus concentration had a significantly higher impact than single factors. Under all the scenarios, the increased contributions of species that were dominant before the changes and the extinction of rare species were observed. Ultimately, cladoceran communities displayed functional overcompensation and loss of species in comparison to prechanged communities.																				2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	2							249	10.3390/w16020249	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16020249													WOS:001151211500001

Quantitative evidence for Arctic continental freezing in a high-CO2 world: Junggar Basin, NW China	TRIASSIC AND JURASSIC OF THE JUNGGAR BASIN, CHINA: Advances in Palaeontology and Environments	Geological Society Special Publication											We show that the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic continental Arctic experienced wintertime freezing conditions, despite the exceptionally high atmospheric CO2 levels, by quantifying common lake ice-rafted debris (L-IRD) identified in the Junggar Basin of Xinjian, NW China. This L-IRD consists of outsized (0.112 mm) lithic clasts 'floating' in otherwise fine-grained, profundal lake sediment matrix. Laser-diffraction grain-size analysis demonstrates that the grain-size distribution for lacustrine strata of Junggar Basin is very similar to modern sediments from the seasonally ice-covered Sea of Okhotsk, reflecting a similar depositional mechanism. Three-dimensional computed tomography and two-dimensional thin sections demonstrate that the outsized clasts are dispersed, rather than confined to sand lenses or layers. These results are inconsistent with alternative methods of bimodal sediment deposition such as mud flows, algae rafting or root rafting. The discovery of Triassic-Jurassic continental freezing provides new context for understanding global climate during periods with high-CO2 conditions and climate and biotic changes in the Mesozoic Era.

Monitoring the occurrence and location using in situ methods is expensive and challenging due to the lake's vastness. Remote sensing monitoring methods offer an alternate option due to the ability to cover vast areas. This study explores the potential of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), specifically utilising Sentinel-1 VV-VH data to map and monitor water hyacinth cover. The change detection method based on optimization of power difference and minimum eigenvalue selection achieves a remarkable accuracy of 98.89% in separating clear and water hyacinth-infested water. Using polarimetric data offered better separability, enabling spatial and temporal monitoring. The analysis reveals that in 2018 water hyacinth cover peaked, spanning over 200 km(2). Temporal variability showcases a seasonal rise and peak from September to December. This research demonstrates the capability of using PolSAR data to accurately map and monitor water hyacinth's spatial and temporal dynamics, offering valuable insights for effective management strategies.					; Soares Silva, Thiago/JRX-8897-2023; Silva, Thiago/A-2444-2009	Isundwa, Felix Kasiti/0000-0001-9776-0580; Silva, Thiago/0000-0001-8174-0489													1939-1404	2151-1535					2024	17						19900	19910		10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3476938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3476938													WOS:001358354000004

A Comprehensive Biogeochemical Assessment of Climate-Threatened Glacial River Headwaters on the Eastern Slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate change is driving the loss of alpine glaciers globally, yet investigations about the water quality of rivers stemming from them are few. Here we provide an overview assessment of a biogeochemical data set containing 200+ parameters that we collected between 2019 and 2021 from the headwaters of three such rivers (Sunwapta-Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, and Bow) which originate from the glacierized eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. We used regional hydrometric data sets to accurately model discharge at our 14 sampling sites. We created a Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) using riverine water isotope signatures and compared it to collected regional rain, snow, and glacial ice signatures. Principal component analyses of river physicochemical measures revealed distance from glacier explained more data variability than other spatiotemporal factors (i.e., season, year, or river). Discharge, chemical concentrations, and watershed areas were then used to model site-specific open water season yields for 25 parameters. Chemical yields followed what would generally be expected along river continuums from glacierized to montane altitudinal life zones, with landscape characteristics driving chemical sources and sinks. For instance, particulate chemical yields were generally highest near source glaciers with proglacial lakes acting as settling ponds, whereas most dissolved yields varied by parameter and site. As these headwaters continue to evolve with glacier mass loss, the data set and analyses presented here can be used as a contemporary baseline to mark future change against. Further, following this initial assessment of our data set, we encourage others to mine it for additional biogeochemical studies. Alpine glaciers are vulnerable to climate change, with their numbers and sizes expected to decline dramatically within the current century. It is known that a decrease in glacier mass will have direct consequences on glacial meltwater quantity, but how this may impact the quality of receiving freshwaters is less understood. Our goal was to record a water quality data set of 200+ physical and chemical parameters for the headwaters of three major rivers draining glaciers on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. We first used statistics to model how fast the rivers were flowing at our 14 sampling locations over our 2-year sampling period. We then looked at how and why water isotopes collected from river, rain, snow, and glacier ice samples differed. We discovered that distance downstream from the glacier explained more statistical variation in our physical and chemical measures than season, year, or river. Finally, at each of our sampling sites, we calculated chemical yields, or the amount of chemical constituent being exported downriver per unit watershed area, and found landscape features like lakes, outwash plains, and forests influence them. We ultimately hope that others use our comprehensive data set to investigate this changing region further. We assessed a 200+ parameter data set collected from glacial river headwaters on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky MountainsOur findings can act as a contemporary reference for future investigation of glacial headwaters in rapidly evolving alpine regionsThe possibilities for data exploration of our 260,000+ measure data set are numerous and we encourage others to mine it for new studies					; Cooke, Colin/E-7842-2011; Emmerton, Craig/G-2900-2013; Serbu, Jessica/OAJ-7256-2025; Poesch, Mark/G-1013-2011; Tank, Suzanne/I-4816-2012	Cooke, Colin/0000-0002-7417-5263; Bhatia, Maya/0000-0002-5236-8689; Serbu, Jessica/0000-0002-0109-4550; Silins, Uldis/0000-0003-2006-3415; Cavaco, Maria/0000-0003-4304-3820; Criscitiello, Alison/0000-0002-8741-709X; Holland, Kira/0000-0002-4228-8976; Tank, Suzanne/0000-0002-5371-6577; Emmerton, Craig/0000-0001-9511-9191													2169-8953	2169-8961				JAN	2024	129	1							e2023JG007745	10.1029/2023JG007745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JG007745													WOS:001133676300001

One- and Three-Dimensional Hydrodynamic, Water Temperature, and Dissolved Oxygen Modeling Comparison	WATER												Understanding and modeling water quality in a lake/reservoir is important to the effective management of aquatic ecosystems. The advantages and disadvantages of different water quality models make it challenging to choose the most suitable model; however, direct comparison of 1-D and 3-D models for lake water quality modeling can reveal their relative performance and enable modelers and lake managers to make informed decisions. In this study, we compared the 1-D model MINLAKE and the 3-D model EFDC+ for water temperature, ice cover, and dissolved oxygen (DO) simulation in three Minnesota lakes (50-m Carlos Lake, 23.5-m Trout Lake, and 5.6-m Pearl Lake). EFDC+ performed well for water temperature and DO simulation in the open water seasons with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.32 degrees C and 1.48 mg/L, respectively. After analyzing the ice thickness with relevant data, it was found that EFDC+ calculates a shorter ice cover period and smaller ice thickness. EFDC+ does not consider snowfall for ice thickness simulation. The results also revealed that EFDC+ considers spatial variance and allows the user to select inflow/outflow locations precisely. This is important for large lakes with complex bathymetry or lakes having multiple inlets and outlets.

As one of the most common FABs, Cladophora blooms have been reported in the lakes of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during the past few years. However, there have been few studies focused on how FABs impact other aquatic organisms, especially in alpine lakes since these are at the forefront of responding to global climate change. In this study, the phytoplankton communities in different regions of Qinghai Lake were profiled in different seasons using meta-barcode sequencing. The phytoplankton assemblages in areas with Cladophora blooms were compared to those without Cladophora. The phytoplankton community structure correlated with physicochemical properties including water temperature, electrical conductivity, nitrate, and the presence or absence of Cladophora blooms. The relative abundance of Bacillariophytes was found to be higher in zones with Cladophora blooms than in other regions. Significant seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass and beta diversity were observed in zones with Cladophora blooms. Growth and microbial degradation of Cladophora can change the pH, dissolved oxygen, secchi depth, and nitrate. Together with seasonal temperature and electrical conductivity changes, Cladophora growth can significantly impact the phytoplankton biomass, community dissimilarity and assembly process. These results showed that Cladophora plays a key role in littoral aquatic ecosystem ecology.

As an indicator of climate change, the surface water temperature of plateau lakes is particularly sensitive to climate warming. In this study, the machine learning model and physical process model are combined to predict water temperature in lake systems: The Air2water model and the long short term memory (LSTM) model are combined to form a prediction model for the inversion and prediction of 11 typical plateau lakes in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The modeling results show that the Air2water model performs best, followed by the LSTM model. Overall, the Air2water model and the LSTM model effectively reproduce the monthly, seasonal, and interannual variations of LSWT dynamics in the 11 lakes. The research results show that the LSWT dataset from 2021 to 2025 is constructed based on the forecast result, and it is found that six lakes, including Caohai, Dianchi, Erhai, Qionghai, Xingyun Lake, and Yangzonghai, showed significant warming in the next five years (the maximum warming rate was less than +0.2 degrees C/year), while the remaining five lakes showed no significant changes, and the size classification of LSWT data in different spaces on the interannual scale was consistent with the classification of altitudes. By conducting extensive exploration and research on the inversion of LSWT using physical process models and machine learning models, this study offers novel solutions for LSWT prediction and inversion. The study also provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation for future LSWT research, thereby holding practical significance and research value.

J	Zhang, XY; Geng, MM; Yang, X; Li, C				Zhang, Xiaoyong; Geng, Miaomiao; Yang, Xuan; Li, Cong			An Enhanced Dual-Stream Network Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Imagery for Water Body Segmentation	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Accurate surface water mapping is crucial for rationalizing water resource utilization and maintaining ecosystem sustainability. However, the diverse shapes and scales of water bodies pose challenges in automatically extracting them from remote sensing images. Existing methods suffer from inaccurate lake boundary extraction, inconsistent results, and failure to detect small rivers. In this study, we propose a dual-stream parallel feature aggregation network to address these limitations. Our network effectively combines global information interaction from the Swin Transformer network with deep local information integration from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, we introduce a deformable convolution-based attention mechanism module (D-CBAM) that adaptively adjusts receptive field size and shape, highlights important channels in feature maps automatically, and enhances the expressive ability of our network. Additionally, we incorporate a Feature Pyramid Attention (FPA) module during the advanced coding stage for multi-scale feature learning to improve segmentation accuracy for small water bodies. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we chose the Yellow River Basin in China as the research area and used Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images as well as manually labelling samples to construct a dataset. On this dataset, our method achieves a 93.7% F1 score, which is a significant improvement compared with other methods. Finally, we use the proposed method to map the seasonal and permanent water bodies in the Yellow River Basin in 2021 and compare it with existing water bodies. The results show that our method has certain advantages in mapping large-scale water bodies, which not only ensures the overall integrity but also retains local details.

Anne			Arctic ecosystem restoration with native tundra bryophytes	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Bryophytes are ecologically essential to northern ecosystem restoration after disturbance. In this study, native bryophytes were used to revegetate two Arctic restoration sites. Different propagation types (small, medium, large fragments) and substrates (crushed rock, lake sediment, processed kimberlite in Canada; volcanic silt loam and crushed lava rock in Iceland) with two erosion control treatments (with and without cheesecloth) were evaluated. After two growing seasons, large bryophyte fragments resulted in the greatest density and total and live cover with erosion control and medium fragments resulted in the highest density and species occurrence without erosion control. Erosion control significantly increased live cover, total cover, species occurrence, and density, including a tempering effect on soil volumetric water content and temperature. Substrates with more heterogeneous surfaces (crushed rock, volcanic silt loam, crushed lava rock) yielded higher live cover, density, and spontaneous colonization than more homogeneous substrates (processed kimberlite, lake sediment) and can be more suitable for use in arctic ecosystems revegetation. The positive outcomes in both Canada and Iceland led to the conclusion that bryophyte propagation with large to medium fragments, erosion control with cheesecloth, and substrates with heterogeneous surfaces would be effective restoration approaches where bryophyte revegetation is a focus.

Installation of floodgates in 2001 increased water exchange and decreased trace-metal content, thereby improving the benthic environment within the lake. We analyzed surface sediments (including grain size, pH, trace-metal concentrations), water-quality data, and the assemblages of, and prevalence of deformities in, the benthic foraminifera, to understand the effects of recent changes in salinity variability. Since spatial and temporal distributions of benthic foraminifera are known to vary in response to both biotic and abiotic environmental variables, they are useful indicators of environmental change. Since the installation of floodgates, surface-sediment composition coarsened from silt to sandy mud/muddy sand in response to increased water flow. Trace-metal contaminants (Ni, Cu and Zn) have decreased and are close to the Effect Range-Low (ER-L) designation. We identified 15 species of benthic foraminifera (3 agglutinated, 10 calcareous-hyaline, and 2 calcareous-porcelaneous). Buccella frigida and Elphidium albiumbilicatum were dominant, but seven sampling localities formed a nearly abiotic zone. Although trace contaminants have decreased, a high prevalence of test deformities (up to 65%) was observed, mostly in E. albiumbilicatum. Our findings suggest these abnormalities may be strongly related to the effects of seasonal variation of salinity in Lake Shihwa.

J	Maley, J; Brenac, P				Maley, J; Brenac, P			Vegetation dynamics, palaeoenvironments and climatic changes in the forests of western Cameroon during the last 28,000 years BP	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The lake Barombi Mbo pollen record goes back to about 28,000 yr B.P. The pollen diagram based on 82 samples is subdivided into four main pollen zones. Zone I (ca. 28,000 to 20,000 yr B.P.) is characterized by relatively high frequencies of Caesalpiniaceae and also by a montane element with Olea capensis. The climate was cool and relatively wet. Zone II (ca. 20,000 to 10,000 yr B.P.). A sharp increase in Gramineae, the main non-arboreal land pollen taxon, began around 20,000 yr B.P. and lasted until 10,000 yr B.P. During this period the forest receded, giving way to a more open vegetation, but significant patches of forest (refuges) persisted in the area. This is confirmed by isotopic analyses (delta(13)C) Of sedimentary detritic organic matter from the catchment. Until ca. 13,000 yr B.P. Olea capensis was well represented indicating a relatively cool climate. Between 13,000 and 12,000 yr B.P. a warming trend associated with a strong increase in precipitation occurred. After this an abrupt reduction in precipitation linked to an increase in seasonality, but without temperature lowering, intervened between ca. 11,500 and 10,400 yr B.P. This last phase corresponds partly to the Younger Dryas time period. Zone III (ca. 10,000 to 2800 yr B.P.). After ca. 10,400 yr B.P. the climate became very wet until ca. 3000 yr B.P. A sharp decrease in the Gramineae intervened at ca. 10,000 yr B.P.; from ca. 9500 to 3000 yr B.P. they remained very low, between 0 and 3%, and the forest trees reached their maximum extension. Most of the trees exhibited large variations with quasi-periods of around 1000 to mainly 2000 yr (ca. 2200 calendar years), which could be related to large sylvigenetic or successional cycles. In this zone the Caesalpiniaceae were relatively well represented, with a maximum extension between 4500 and 3000 yr B.P. Podocarpus, a typical tree of the montane stratiform cloud forests, exhibited very low frequencies before 10,000 yr B.P. but their relative increase during the early and middle Holocene can only be explained by its growth on distant mountains. Its maximum extension phase was roughly synchronous with that of Caesalpiniaceae. The climate was warm and wet, but cooler on the mountains. Zone IV (ca. 2800 yr B.P. to present time). Around 2800 yr B.P. a sharp increase in the Gramineae, peaking at 30 to 40% of total pollen between ca. 2500 and 2000 yr B.P., indicates a sudden phase of vegetation opening and forest retreat, accompanied by severe erosion. Alchornea, a typical pioneer taxon, increased rapidly at the same time to large frequencies because it develops abundantly in all the openings. Elaeis guineensis, originally a pioneer palm tree, follows the same pattern. The climate was warm, relatively dry, and linked to an increase of seasonality. After 2000 yr B.P. the Gramineae returned to low frequencies, around 10%, associated with a strong increase in trees, indicating that the forest expanded again but not to the same extent as in the early and middle Holocene. The climate was warm and relatively wet, rather similar to the present-day climate. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.																			0034-6667	1879-0615				JAN	1998	99	2					157	187		10.1016/S0034-6667(97)00047-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0034-6667(97)00047-X													WOS:000072704700007
J	Melstrom, EM; Birgenheier, LP				Melstrom, Ellen M.; Birgenheier, Lauren P.			Stratigraphic architecture of climate influenced hyperpycnal mouth bars	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Investigation of the process sedimentology of mouth bar deposition demonstrates a link to the seasonality associated with abrupt climate warming events during the early Eocene. While a relationship between fluvial sedimentology and climate events has been established previously, such documentation within mouth bar deposits is missing. Deltaic mouth bars of the Douglas Creek Member of the Green River Formation in the Uinta Basin record a fluvial-lacustrine response to abrupt warming events associated with the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. This study ties the observed sedimentology of these mouth bars and their deposition via hyperpycnal currents to these climatic events. Detailed measured sections and analysis of stratigraphic architecture of outcrops in the eastern Uinta Basin document the sedimentology and stratigraphy of delta mouth bar complexes. Internal structures include climbing ripple cross-lamination, convolute bedding, and those associated with transitional to upper-flow regime bedforms such as planar laminations with normal grading and convex-upward stratifications. The dominance of upper-flow regime bedforms as well as interpreted long run out distances suggests that density currents deposited mouth bars tens of kilometres from the shoreline under Froude supercritical flow conditions. The highly seasonal climate regime of the early Eocene, capable of producing high-sediment yield flooding events, likely provided the mechanism for hyperpycnal current formation within a relatively freshwater lake and controlled the timing of mouth bar deposition. Discrete lacustrine carbonate-dominated packages separate periods of episodic fluvial discharge, recording reduced fluvial deposition between warming events. The established link between the occurrence of upper-flow regime bedforms and the timing of climate warming events suggests that these climate conditions may be important for their formation and preservation. The study has implications for expanding existing mouth bar depositional models to include climatically controlled upper-flow regime bedforms.

The isotope composition of modern precipitation is strongly linked to local temperatures in high latitudes and, less clearly, to the amount of precipitation in low latitudes. As the isotopic composition of precipitation can be reconstructed from many palaeo-archives these isotopes serve as quantitative climate proxies for the past. In this report we describe the different type of models that have been used to understand the global distribution of the isotopic composition of precipitation, today and in the past. The focus of this paper is on the results of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) that have been fitted with water isotope diagnostics. A good correspondence between simulated and observed water isotope signals is demonstrated on an annual time-scale. In particular the regional and seasonal isotope-temperature relations estimated by the AGCMs were in good agreement with global observations. Furthermore, we discuss the results of the models when they are forced with the climatic boundary conditions of 21 kyr BP (last glacial maximum) and of 6 kyr BP (mid-Holocene). These numerical experiments allow us to compare directly the results of the AGCMs, that is the water isotopes, with the corresponding palaeo-observations. We confirmed that in general the water isotopes are valuable proxies of temperature variations in high latitudes. The calibration of the 'isotope- temperature thermometer', however, might be biased by local effects, such as the seasonal distribution of precipitation or the strength of the local temperature inversion. Moreover, comparable 'small differences' in the forcing compared with today's climate, such as in the mid-Holocene experiment, produce small responses of the water isotopes, which are often strongly affected by atmospheric circulation changes. Finally, future applications of isotopic AGCMs, such as the coupling with the carbon cycle or the study of cloud processes, are discussed also.

J	Lahnsteiner, F; Kletzl, M; Weismann, T				Lahnsteiner, Franz; Kletzl, Manfred; Weismann, Thomas			The risk of parasite transfer to juvenile fishes by live copepod food with the example Triaenophorus crassus and Triaenophorus nodulosus	AQUACULTURE												Natural zooplankton is a potential food resource for juvenile fish in fish farms as it is a good source of fats, carbohydrates, and protein. However, it is also a potential source of parasites and pathogens. The present study was conducted (1) to estimate the risk of parasite transfer by live copepod food under intensive farming conditions using the parasites Triaenophorus crassus and Triaenophorus nodulosus as example and (2) to look for strategies to avoid parasite infestation of juvenile fish. An easy and routinely applicable aniline blue staining method was developed to check the infestation levels of copepods with procercoids during the on-growing season of juvenile fish. From the copepod species occurring in zooplankton Cyclops spp. was infested frequently (9.4 +/- 12.0%, maximum 38.7%), Diaptomus spp. infrequently (1.5 +/- 1.6%, maximum 3.2%), Daphnia spp. never. juvenile grayling, Thymallus thymallus, and corgonids, Coregonus sp., which had been fed with natural zooplankton revealed infestations rates with T crassus of circa 5%, with T nodulosus of circa 10%. As the occurrence of procercoids in the zooplankton was temporary limited, Triaenophorus infestation can be avoided by using artificial food instead of live copepods during the risky season. To prevent parasite infestation of juvenile fish methods were investigated to eradicate procercoids from copepods by chemical treatment (sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, citric acid treatment) and by freeze-thawing methods. Chemical methods failed to remove procercoids. In fish, which had been fed with frozen thawed zooplankton, no Triaenophoras spp. infestation was observed. Their survival rates were similar as in the control fed with live zooplankton, however the weight of the fish was significantly lower.

Activity, Movements and Activity Area Size in Stinkpot Turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) in a Southwestern Michigan Lake	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												We used radio telemetry to evaluate activity area size, habitat use, diurnal activity, and the influence of weather, environmental temperatures and sex on daily movements in 18 Sternotherus odoratus in southwestern Michigan Turtles mainly moved within the highly vegetated littoral zone but two individuals used wet meadow areas adjacent to the lake and an adjoining stream. Activity area size, as measured by the 95% fixed kernel method using 40 radio telemetry days per individual, did not vary between the sexes. Mean total daily distance moved (TDDM) over a 12 h time period averaged 27 m and was not influenced by sex or by variation in daily weather conditions. However, seasonal changes in environmental temperatures were positively correlated with mean daily shell temperature (T(s)) and TDDM indicating limits on activity on relatively cool days. While turtles were found to move at any time over the course of a day, distances moved during six, 4 h intervals over a 24 h period were greatest during the late morning and late afternoon. Mean T(s) was greatest during the afternoon but did not differ between the sexes and mean T(s) was similar to prevailing water temperatures indicating that bimodal activity was probably not dictated by diel variation in temperature.																			0003-0031					OCT	2009	162	2					266	275		10.1674/0003-0031-162.2.266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-162.2.266													WOS:000271138500005

Eradication of the invasive Pseudorasbora parva results in increased growth and production of native fishes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva, has been described as Europe's most invasive fish. To control their UK invasion, some lentic populations at risk of causing fluvial dispersal have been eradicated. The first of these operations was from a lake in north-west UK in March 2005 using rotenone application; prior to eradication, their mean density was estimated as 6.1 m(-2) whereas since eradication, no P. parva have been recorded. Prior to rotenone application, the majority of native fishes were removed, held off-site and reintroduced following degradation of rotenone to safe levels. In the three growth seasons since their reintroduction and P. parva eradication, the abundance, somatic growth rate and production of roach Rutilus rutilus and common bream Abramis brama have increased significantly; production is now driven by a lower number of comparatively larger, faster growing individuals. These data suggest that the eradication of this P. parva population has been highly beneficial for the growth, recruitment and production of these native species.

Spawning site selection by Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) in relation to temperature and wave exposure	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The selection of spawning depth by Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis was investigated in an experiment using artificial substrata in Lake Constance during the spawning season of 2007. The experiment compared spawning behaviour at substrata between 0.5 and 15 m depth at two sites exposed to different regimes of ship-generated wave action. The total abundance of egg ribbons did not differ significantly between the two sites, but the preferred spawning depth was deeper at the wave exposed site (5 m) compared to the sheltered site (2 m). While water temperatures could not account for the observations, differences in wave exposure may explain the different spawning depth preferences. At both sites, large egg ribbons were generally found in deeper water, and large egg ribbons occurred more frequently at the sheltered site. Because the egg ribbons of perch are likely to have a size-dependent susceptibility to hydrodynamic stress, large females may be expected to select deeper spawning locations where the effects of surface waves are considerably attenuated.

A between-class (between-station) Correspondence Analysis (CA) showed that, on the scale of the alluvial plain, habitat is a major factor influencing the species assemblages. The assemblage composition on the transversal floodplain gradient was compared with existing data on assemblages from the main channel of the Garonne River (South of France) and three of its floodplain waters (two side arms and one oxbow lake). In order to work at the level of taxonomic determination commonly used in paleoecological studies, the overall dataset (lower Rhone + Garonne) was analyzed to the genus level. The genus level analysis confirmed that chironomid assemblages can be used to characterize the connectivity of small waterbodies with the main river channel and 44 chironomid genera were classified according to their hydrological preferences (lentic habitat taxa, ubiquitous taxa and lotic habitat taxa). This classification was then applied to a paleoecological dataset from the Saint-Omer basin (North of France) in order to test the potential of chironomids for paleoecological studies on fluvial environments. The results presented here highlighted this potential and indicate that river chironomid assemblages can be used as descriptors for alluvial habitats, and allow researchers to evaluate the level of connectivity of these habitats with the main river channel during floods. River chironomid assemblages are a promising tool for reconstructing past hydrological changes and for obtaining information on paleoflood periodicity.

J	Stanley, DJ; Warne, AG				Stanley, DJ; Warne, AG			Nile delta in its destruction phase	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					World Deltas Symposium	AUG 23-29, 1998	NEW ORLEANS, LA	Ocean Energy Inc				All deltas undergo alternating construction to destruction phases due to fundamental changes in the relative influence of sediment input from rivers and redistribution by marine coastal processes. During the past 7000 years world deltas, including the Nile, have been in an overall construction phase. However, the Nile delta has converted to a destruction phase during the past 150 years, triggered by water regulation which has disrupted the balance among sediment influx, erosive effects of coastal processes, and subsidence. This former depocenter has been altered to the extent that it is no longer a functioning delta but, rather, a subsiding and eroding coastal plain. Symptoms of the destruction phase of the Nile delta include accelerated coastal erosion and straightening of the shoreline, reduction in wetland size, increased landward incursion of saline groundwater, and buildup of salt and pollutants to toxic levels in wetlands and delta plain. Without seasonal flushing by floods, the former delta plain surface is now incapable of recycling and/or removing agricultural, municipal and industrial wastes generated by Egypt's rapidly expanding population. Moreover, the remaining capacity of the system to regenerate itself will further diminish as water is diverted away from the delta for new irrigation and municipal projects in the Egyptian desert, and water allocations to Egypt are decreased by upstream countries. Reestablishing some level of natural hydrology is the only credible solution for attaining equilibrium among sediment accretion on the delta plain to offset subsidence, progradation along the coast to offset erosion, and sufficient water influx to flush and remove the high levels of salt and pollutants throughout the system. However, increased Nile water and sediment discharge could begin to restore a functioning delta system only if there is a substantial reduction in human impacts.																			0749-0208					SUM	1998	14	3					794	825																WOS:000075421100008

A total of 60 sediment samples were collected and the concentrations of 10 elements (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, Al, As) were determined. The obtained findings were compared to the limit values for the sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and were investigated using sediment assessment methods. The results indicate that the values for SQGs revealed that the concentrations of Ni and As should be emphasised. Toxic unit (TU) values showed that As and Ni together constitute 69.95-80.09% of the total toxic effect alone for all lakes. In addition, the Contamination factor (Cf) and Enrichment factor (EF) detected the concentration of As for Kesikkopru Dam Lake as being at a medium and higher accumulation levels, although the Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) detected that As leads to contamination below the medium level. When the total element accumulation was evaluated, no risk was detected for the lakes. Cluster analysis (CA) revealed quite different elemental profiles for 3 lakes. The strongest correlation between the elements was observed for Cu-Ni (r = 0.942) in cubuk 2, whereas cubuk 2 was the lake with the highest seasonal elemental variation among the lakes investigated.

The divisions Chlorophyta and Cyanoprokaryota, followed by Ochrophyta had the highest frequency of occurrence. We have applied a functional classification of algae based on the Reynolds theory, according to which the plankton algae were classified into nineteen functional groups. We have identified forty-three dominant phytoplankton taxa in the reservoir. The comparison of dominant functional groups indicates that the most common are codon members F, P, K, H1 and J. At the time of the study Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton and Closterium aciculare T. West of the functional group P; Aphanizomenon flosaquae Ralfs ex Bornet & Flahault (H1), Ankyra judayi (G.M. Smith) Fott (X1), Coelastrum micmporum Nageli (J), Oocystis lacustris Chodat (F) and Aphanocapsa planctonica (G.M. Smith) Komarek & Anagnostidis (K) had the highest abundance.

The record from Twin Ponds spans from 13.5 cal ka BP (1950 AD) to present, but contains a 6 ka long hiatus starting shortly after 7.5 cal ka BP. We compare the record for ca. 13.5-7.5 cal ka BP with published delta O-18 data from the region after using a Bayesian approach to produce many possible chronologies for each site. Principal component analysis then identified chronologically-robust, multi-site oxygen isotope signals, including negative values during the Younger Dryas, but no significant deviations from the early Holocene mean of the regional records. However, differences among sites indicate significant trends that likely relate to interacting changes in the regional gradients of seasonal temperatures and precipitation as well as moisture sources, moisture pathways, and aridity that were controlled by large-scale climatic controls such as insolation, the progressive decline of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and changes in oceanic circulation. Centennial shifts punctuate these trends at ca. 9.3 and 8.2 cal ka BP, and reveal that the local character of these short-lived features requires a detailed understanding of lake hydrology and regional isotopic gradients to yield reliable information for regional climate reconstructions.

Angiosperm fossil woods from the Upper Cretaceous (Cardiel Formation) of Argentinean Patagonia	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												We describe nine angiosperm fossil woods from sediments of the Cardiel Formation (Upper Cretaceous) near the Cardiel Lake, Santa Cruz Province, Argentinian Patagonia. On the basis of the characteristics of the anatomy, the specimens were placed in three fossil species: Weinmannioxylon trichospermoides related to the Cunoniaceae, Burseroxylon panzai sp. nov. possibly related to the Anacardiaceae or Burseraceae, and a new taxon with unknown affinity, Tortorellixylon oligoporosum gen. et sp. nov. Angiosperms are 15% of the assemblage and conifers 85%, which is consistent with previous studies of fossil woods from the Late Cretaceous of Patagonia. Most specimens show poorly distinct growth ring boundaries that suggest a weakly marked annual seasonality during the deposition of the Cardiel Formation. In addition, the specimens' size and the rings' curvature are consistent with large trees. Decay patterns similar to those produced by modern xylophagous fungi are also recognized in most specimens. The identification of three species in an assemblage of nine fossil woods suggests a significant taxonomic richness of angiosperms, and the taxonomic composition suggests a Late Cretaceous age for the Cardiel Formation (probably Campanian-Maastrichtian). These new records allow a better understanding of the composition of the fossil forests of the Late Cretaceous of Patagonia, in which the tree canopy was apparently dominated by conifers.

Persistence and stability of cichlid assemblages in neotropical floodplain lagoons	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												In this study, we evaluated how cichlid assemblages are affected by seasonal and interannual variations in water volume in the floodplain lagoons of the Cuiaba River in the Pantanal wetland. Eleven lagoons were sampled in the early dry season and the early rainy season over a three-year period. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that the species compositions and relative abundances were distinct between the seasons, which indicates that neither persistence nor stability was maintained on a seasonal basis. However, the interannual comparisons show the opposite tendency, indicating strong stability and persistence on an annual basis. These results indicate that the cichlid assemblages in these lagoons have two equilibrium points, one in the early dry season and the other in the early rainy season, and that the assemblages alternate between these points through the hydrologic cycle. In addition to the effect of the water level variation, the abundance distribution is also affected by conductivity and pH, which also influence the total abundance of the species in the assemblage.					; Fernandes, Izaias/H-8000-2015; Penha, Jerry/D-6238-2013; Mateus, Lucia/H-7964-2015	Mateus, Lucia/0000-0001-5749-9533; Penha, Jerry/0000-0003-4437-092X; Fernandes, Izaias/0000-0003-0402-2891; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				FEB	2012	93	3					427	437		10.1007/s10641-011-9933-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9933-9													WOS:000299768600011

Here we present a multidisciplinary study of the Subeng section (Inner Mongolia, P.R. China), integrating sedimentological, stratigraphical and diverse palaeontological data, in order to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment and to enhance the understanding of the late Paleocene communities that once thrived on the Mongolian Plateau. The Subeng section starts with the Maastrichtian Iren Dabasu Formation directly covered by the late Paleocene Nomogen Formation. This Nomogen Formation is composed of typical lacustrine deposits at the base, covered by fluvio-lacustrine deposits at the top. Both types of deposits provided rich ostracod and charophyte assemblages, closest to those of the Naran Member, Naran Bulak Formation of Mongolia. Palynomorphs from the lake sediments suggest a local flora at Subeng more wooded and closed than reported from elsewhere in this region. The fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the Nomogen Formation have yielded a vertebrate fauna especially rich in mammals. The mammal fauna from Subeng is close to that from Bayan Ulan and typical for the Gashatan Asian Land Mammal Age. The presence of reworked pedogenic carbonate nodules and mud aggregates suggests an at least seasonally dry regional climate. Combined sedimentological and palaeontological data suggest the late Paleocene Nomogen Formation at Subeng was an isolated woodland in a fluvio-lacustrine environment, representing a locally humid environment on the semi-arid Mongolian Plateau. The mammal fauna reflects these differences and shows a number of relatives to mammals from the more humid northeastern Chinese biotic province as well as some North American immigrants.

Changes in the thermal habitat will alter the thermal boundaries that currently limit the distribution of many species. Species such as smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu are currently limited in their northern distribution by temperature-related effects as the length of the growing season determines population viability through overwinter survival of the young-of-the-year. Using a climate change scenario, we estimate the additional area and number of lakes within Ontario that will provide suitable thermal habitat sufficient for their viability. Smallmouth bass are known to have strong negative impacts on many other aquatic species. We estimate their impact, in extirpating four cyprinid species, northern redbelly dace Phoxinus eos, finescale dace Phoxinus neogaeus, fathead minnow Pimephales promelas, and pearl dace Margariscus margarita, in Ontario. We estimate that in excess of 25,000 populations of these species may be lost and discuss the relative sources of errors within our modeling approach.

J	LeHouerou, HN				LeHouerou, HN			Climate change, drought and desertification	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The definition of desertification accepted in the ad hoc conference held by UNEP in Nairobi in 1971 and confirmed at the Earth Summit on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 is: 'arid, semi-arid and dry-subhumid land degradation'. There is no global long-term trend in any rainfall change over the period of instrumental record (c. 150 years), but there has been an increase of 0.5 degrees C in global temperature over the past 100 years. This increase seems partly due to urbanization, as there is no evidence of it resulting from atmospheric pollution by CO2 and other warming gases (SO2, NO2, CH4, CFH etc.). On the other hand, the thermal increase is uneven, increasing with latitudes above 40 degrees N and S. The increase is only slight or non-existent in subtropical and inter-tropical latitudes where most arid and semi-arid lands lie. This, incidently, is consistent with Global Circulation Models (GCM)-derived scenarios. The study of tree-rings, lake level fluctuations and pollen analysis confinn the existence of climatic fluctuations, but with no long-term trends over the past 2000 years. A possible increase of 1-3 degrees C in arid lands over the next 50 years due to a doubling of the CO2 content of the lower atmosphere to 700 p.p.m., as assumed by most scenarios stemming from GCM, would increase global potential evapo-transpiration (PET) by some 75-225 mm year(-1). The ratio of mean annual precipitation to PET would then decrease by about 4-5%, assuming that no substantial changes in rainfall took place in arid and semiarid lands. However, the impact of CO2 on plants would boost photosynthesis and, therefore, primary productivity; it would also increase water-use efficiency via the reduction of stomatal conductance. It is therefore at present difficult to predict the net balance of these two opposite consequences or to prophesy which phenomenon would prevail: increased aridity or higher productivity and more efficient water use. At all events, the possible effect of a climatic fluctuation (or change) of the magnitude envisaged would have a trivial consequence on arid environments, as compared with the past and present impact of humans and their livestock. Drought has always been a normal recurrent event in arid and semi-arid lands. Strategies and tactics to mitigate its consequences via improved land-use and management practices are analysed.

Thus, it is crucial to precisely reveal the current state and predict future trends in the carbon budget of the alpine meadow ecosystem. The objective of this study was to explore the applicability of the Biome-BGC model (BBGC) in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB), identify the key parameters affecting the variation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and further predict the future trends in carbon budget in the QLB.ResultsThe alpine meadow mainly acted as carbon sink during the growing season. For the eco-physiological factors, the YEL (Yearday to end litterfall), YSNG (Yearday to start new growth), CLEC (Canopy light extinction coefficient), FRC:LC (New fine root C: new leaf C), SLA (Canopy average specific leaf area), C:Nleaf (C:N of leaves), and FLNR (Fraction of leaf N in Rubisco) were confirmed to be the top seven parameters affecting carbon budget of the alpine meadow. For the meteorological factors, the sensitivity of NEE to precipitation was greater than that to vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and it was greater to radiation than to air temperature. Moreover, the combined effect of two different meteorological factors on NEE was higher than the individual effect of each one. In the future, warming and wetting would enhance the carbon sink capacity of the alpine meadow during the growing season, but extreme warming (over 3.84 celcius) would reduce NEE (about 2.9%) in the SSP5-8.5 scenario.ConclusionOverall, the alpine meadow ecosystem in the QLB generally performs as a carbon sink at present and in the future. It is of great significance for the achievement of the goal of carbon neutrality and the management of alpine ecosystems.

J	Oswald, EB; Wohl, E				Oswald, Elizabeth B.; Wohl, Ellen			Wood-mediated geomorphic effects mountains, of a jokulhlaup in the Wind River Mountains, Wyoming	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A jokulhlaup burst from the head of Grasshopper Glacier in Wyoming's Wind River Mountains during early September 2003. Five reaches with distinct sedimentation patterns were delineated along the Dinwoody Creek drainage. This paper focuses on a portion of the jokulhlaup route where erosion of the forested banks created 16 large logjams spaced at longitudinal intervals of tens to hundreds of meters. Aggradation within the main channel upstream from each logjam created local sediment wedges, and the jams facilitated overbank deposition during the jokulhlaup. Field surveys during 2004 and 2006 documented logjam characteristics and associated erosional and depositional features, as well as initial modification of the logjams and flood deposits within the normal seasonal high-flow channel. Overbank deposits have not been altered by flows occurring since 2003. Field measurements Supported three hypotheses that (i) logjams present along the forested portions of the jokulhlaup route are larger and more closely spaced than those along adjacent, otherwise comparable stream channels that have not recently experienced a jokulhlaup; (ii) logjams are not randomly located along the jokulhlaup route, but instead reflect specific conditions of channel and valley geometry and flood hydraulics; and (iii) the presence of logjams facilitated significant erosional and depositional effects. This paper documents a sequence of events in which Outburst floodwaters enhance bank erosion and recruitment of wood into the channel, and thus the formation of large logjams. These logjams sufficiently deflect flow to create Substantial overbank deposition in areas of the valley bottom not commonly accessed by normal snowmelt peak discharges, and through this process promote valley-bottom aggradation and sediment storage. Changes in the occurrence of glacier outburst floods thus have the potential to alter the rate and magnitude of valley-bottorn dynamics in these environments, which is particularly relevant given predictions of worldwide global warming and glacial retreat. Processes observed at this field site likely occur in other forested catchments with headwater glaciers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zanazzi, A; Mora, G				Zanazzi, A; Mora, G			Paleoclimatic implications of the relationship between oxygen isotope ratios of moss cellulose and source water in wetlands of Lake Superior	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Groundwater-dominated wetlands contain abundant peat deposits, but few studies have addressed the potential of using the oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) of fen peat cellulose to evaluate past changes in climate. Here, we investigated the relationship between delta O-18 values of pond water and those of moss cellulose from species inhabiting different microenvironments in three different swales near Lake Superior, United States. Isotope results over two growing seasons indicate a negligible effect of evaporation on the studied fens and the strong control of groundwater on the isotopic composition of swale water. Isotopic values for groundwater show a small seasonal variability and their low values suggest the influence of snowmelt. Our results show a consistent offset of 27 +/- 1 parts per thousand between average swale water delta O-18 and cellulose delta O-18 values for hollow Sphagnum species, reflecting the fractionation associated with cellulose biosynthesis. When Sphagnum specics from hummocks are included, the offset shows a larger variability (27 +/- 3 parts per thousand), pointing to evaporative effects affecting hummock species. This evaporative effect is more pronounced in emerged mosses, which show the largest difference (> 30 parts per thousand) relative to their source water. The smaller variability associated with hollow species points to the possibility of performing species-specific analyses from peat cellulose for improved paleoclimatic reconstructions.

J	Wondim, YK; Melese, AW				Wondim, Yirga Kebede; Melese, Ayalew Wondie			Evaluation of the evapotranspiration rate of lacustrine wetland macrophytes in Lake Tana, Ethiopia	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												This study quantified the total evapotranspiration (ET) flux of three major types of macrophytes that cover lacustrine fringe wetlands in Lake Tana, Ethiopia during the dry season, April and May, 2022. This study was conducted to understand lacustrine wetland macrophytes' ET rates and provide an important guideline for designing their conservation and restoration plans. To assess ET rates during the peak dry season, three macrophytes of lacustrine wetlands in Lake Tana were chosen: Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth), Cyperus papyrus, and Echinochloa stagnina. Three replicate lysimeters for each of the three treatment types (macrophytes) and one control type (open water) were applied to measure ET. To calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo), FAO's ETo Calculator Version 3.2 was applied. All statistical analyses were carried out using R software. The results of ET rates from wetland macrophytes (9.05mm/day) were considered to be significantly higher than open water evaporation (5.90mm/day). There was a significant difference in mean ET among the macrophytes [F (3, 488) = 194.6, p < 2e-16 ***]. In this study, crop coefficient (K-c1) (1.99 +/- 0.65) referenced to FAO Penman-Monteith ETo is greater than K-c2 (1.58 +/- 0.59) referenced to open water evaporation (E-ow). In terms of wetland macrophyte type, E. crassipes had the maximum mean Kc values (K-c1 = 2.51 +/- 0.70 and K-c2 = 2.02 +/- 0.67). E. stagnina had the minimum mean Kc values (K-c1 = 1.52 +/- 0.32 and K-c2 = 1.19 +/- 0.24). Except for open water which strongly correlated with sunshine hours (r = 0.61) and solar radiation (r = 0.60), the correlation among daily ET values and meteorological variables was found to be weak. The result of our research indicated that the presence of floating macrophytes of E. crassipes will increase the ET flux during the dry season more than emergent macrophytes and open water surfaces. Our findings could provide an important guideline for designing conservation and restoration plans for C. papyrus and E. stagnina to reverse the spread of E. crassipes and maintaining lacustrine fringe wetlands for fish breeding ground and sediment control.(c) 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Thereby, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) diversity of the bacterial community in acidic lakes decreases with reducing pH, (2) BCC differs between epilimnion and hypolimnion, and (3) BCC in extremely acidic environments does not vary much over time. Therefore, we investigated the BCC of three acidic lakes with different pH values (2.3, 2.7, and 3.2) by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and subsequent sequencing of DGGE bands as well as catalyzed reporter deposition-FISH (CARD-FISH). BCC did not significantly vary among the studied lakes nor differ much between water layers. In contrast, BCC significantly changed over time, which is contradictory to our hypotheses. Bacterial communities were dominated by Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, whereas Actino- and Acidobacteria rarely occurred. Cell numbers of both free and attached bacteria were positively related to DOC concentration. Overall, low pH and extreme chemical conditions of the studied lakes led to similar assemblages of bacteria with pronounced temporal differences. This notion indicates that temporal changes in environmental conditions including food web structure also affect unique communities of bacteria thriving at low pH.

To investigate the effect of temperature on sediment accumulation, the model was run at different temperatures and corresponding sediment inventories were plotted vs. reciprocal temperature. In line with measurements from a previous study looking at sediment inventories of 19 European high-altitude lakes (MOLAR study), we found a stronger temperature dependence of lake sediment concentrations for the less volatile/less soluble PCBs. Seasonal and annual mass balances were investigated and highlighted the importance of internal lake processes controlling the differences in sediment accumulation for the different PCB congeners. For example, the higher temperature dependence of sediment inventories for the high chlorinated congeners is due to the fast dynamics of water-to-sediment transport in comparison to atmospheric deposition processes.

J	Sharip, Z; Zaki, ATA; Zakaria, S				Sharip, Zati; Zaki, Ahmad Taqiyuddin Ahmad; Zakaria, Salmah			Flooding Effects on the Population Dynamics of Cabomba furcata and Nelumbo nucifera in a Shallow Floodplain Wetland	WETLANDS												Cabomba furcata is an introduced species that has been naturalized in Malaysia and is becoming invasive in a shallow wetland - Lake Chini, Pahang - displacing the dominance of the native Nelumbo nucifera. The water level structure, which has reduced flooding, plays a vital role in structuring species dominance in this shallow alluvial wetland of the Pahang River floodplain. Biomass sampling focusing on floating-leaved N. nucifera and submerged C. furcata was conducted from September 2009 to March 2011 to determine its association with flooding and season. We found that the non-native C. furcata exhibits no clear seasonal patterns in biomass compared to the native N. nucifera. However, the C. furcata biomass varied with the lake's water level, which fluctuates with flooding from the Pahang River. High amplitude flooding affected the composition of both C. furcata and N. nucifera. Long-term hydrological and flood data indicate the variability of flooding into the wetland system. The paper concludes by noting the need for concerted sustainable management strategies to be coordinated and managed in addressing Cabomba's threats.					; Sharip, Dr. Zati/F-6300-2012	Sharip, Zati/0000-0003-3523-1178; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2014	34	4					713	723		10.1007/s13157-014-0536-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-014-0536-z													WOS:000340097600008

The investigated ponds form three groups of three reservoirs each found in the rural areas of Machakos district, Mount Kenya region, and Lake Victoria area with varied climatic characteristics. The ponds were sampled in monthly intervals between May 2007 and June 2008 for physicochemical variables including water chemistry, phytoplankton community composition, zooplankton abundance, and bacterial numbers. All ponds were classified as hypertrophic. Seasonal changes were reflected in the phytoplankton pattern, as all ponds showed a community shift after the short dry season in February. Due to high nutrient loads and increased turbidity, Cyanobacteria, which were initially thought to be predominating in all investigated water bodies, were found to play only a minor role except for the Bomet reservoir in Lake Victoria region. Instead, Chloro- and Streptophyta, Dinophyta, and Euglenophyta were abundant in the pelagial. A principal component analysis explained around 85 % of the data variance with four principal components (PCs) interpreted as "location", "ions", "zooplankton", and "particulate matter". A clear separation of ponds with and without cattle access based on algal species community data was found indicating the need for a sustainable use and regular monitoring program as the local population is largely dependent on these sensitive small-scale ecosystems.

J	Poulin, R; Valtonen, ET				Poulin, R; Valtonen, ET			The predictability of helminth community structure in space: a comparison of fish populations from adjacent lakes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												Patterns in helminth community structure can suggest that various processes are acting to shape parasite communities into organised, non-random assemblages of species. It is not clear, however, whether a pattern observed in one host population at one time would be observed again at another time, or at the same time in a different but comparable host population. Here, we test the repeatability of parasite community structure in space, and to a lesser extent time, with data on helminth parasites of two fish species, perch Perca fluviatilis and roach Rutilus rutilus, collected in different seasons from four adjacent lakes in Central Finland. Since populations of the same fish species harbour the same parasite species and were sampled in the same way, we would expect similar patterns in the structure of their helminth parasites if the same structuring processes are acting in all takes. We found that no pairwise association between the most common helminth species were observed consistently between seasons within lakes, or among lakes during the same season. Similarly, nested subset patterns of species assembly were observed in some samples, but not consistently between seasons or among lakes. The lack of repeatability in space and between seasons shown by these analyses indicates that although helminth community structure often departs from randomness, it does not do so in a consistent and predictable manner. There may be some general, large-scale processes acting to structure helminth communities, but local or seasonal influences can often either mask their action, or play more important roles themselves.

Drastic desalination of small lakes in East Siberia (Russia) in the early twentieth century: inferred from sedimentological, geochemical and palynological composition of small lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Reconstruction of temporal and spatial climate development on a seasonal basis during the last few centuries may help us better understand modern-day interplay between natural and anthropogenic climate variability. The objective of this paper is to reconstruct hydrology and landscape changes of East Siberia during the termination of the Little Ice Age and the subsequent Recent Warming. We analysed sediment samples from the saltwater Sulfatnoe Lake, Bolshoye Alginskoe and freshwater Shuchie Lake using high-resolution X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy at 1-mm scan resolution, Fourier-transform infrared techniques and pollen analyses. The depth-age models of the cores were constructed by Pb-210 activity using the constant rate of supply model. The lake sediment cover of these lakes began to form from ca. 1870. Three significant periods (1870-1895, 1895-1925 and from 1925 to the present) were defined in hydrology and chemical regime of these lakes for the past 140 years. Lake levels were extremely low and high saturated with salts during the final period of the Little Ice Age. Lake levels began to slowly rise from 1870 to 1895 and vegetation was poor at that period. Intensive desalination of the lakes occurred in 1895-1925, and environment conditions were temperate and favourable for the majority of the taxa of the regional vegetation. Regional precipitation significantly increased and water saturation of the catchments was high from 1925 to the present. The chemical precipitation of carbonate stopped completely in Lake Shichie and reduced considerably in Lake Sulfatnoe and B. Alginskoe. Strong increasing trend of weathering of the lake catchments began in 1970 and still continues.

Habitat use and ecology of Wattled Curassows on islands in the lower Caqueta River, Colombia	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Despite being endangered, little is known about the natural history and habitat use of Wattled Curassows (Crax globulosa). From September 2008 to March 2009, we examined habitat associations of this species on three islands in the lower Caqueta River, Colombia. Observations of curassows were made during line-transect walks, and habitat variables were measured at points where curassows were and were not observed along those transects to assess potential habitat preferences. A total of 182 sightings yielded encounter rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.89 observations/km across transects. Curassows were more likely to be observed close to the river and to lakes on the islands. Additionally, the importance of the river increased as the distance to internal water sources increased. Other habitat characteristics, including tree density, tree diameter, understory density, and canopy cover, did not differ between areas where Wattled Curassows were and were not observed. Flock size ranged from 1 to 9 individuals; most solitary individuals were males and flocks (>2 individuals) generally consisted of more females than males. The association of Wattled Curassows with water sources during the low-water season may have conservation implications because it could increase their vulnerability to anthropogenic activities such as agricultural activities, fishing, and hunting. As a result, conservation of these curassows on islands in the lower Caqueta River will likely depend on local support. RESUMEN A pesar de estar en peligro, poco se conoce sobre la historia natural y el uso de habitat de Crax globulosa. Desde Septiembre del 2008 a Marzo del 2009, examinamos asociacion con el habitat en esta especie en tres islas del bajo rio Caqueta, Colombia. Observamos los paujiles durante caminatas en transectos en linea y medimos variables del habitat, en puntos con y sin presencia de paujiles a lo largo de los transectos, para evaluar preferencias en el habitat. Un total de 182 avistamientos produjeron tasas de encuentro entre 0.1 y 0.89 observaciones/km a lo largo de los transectos. La probabilidad de observar a los paujiles fue mas alta cerca al rio y lagos en las islas. Adicionalmente, la importancia del rio incremento con el aumento en la distancia a las fuentes de aguas del interior. Otras caracteristicas de habitat que incluyen densidad y diametro de arboles, densidad del sotobosque y cobertura del dosel, no variaron entre areas en donde C. globulosa fue o no observado. El tamano de la bandada fluctuo entre 1 y 9 individuos; la mayoria de los individuos solitarios fueron machos y las bandadas (>2 individuos) generalmente tenian mas hembras que machos. La asociacion de C. globulosa con fuentes de agua durante la temporada de aguas bajas puede tener implicaciones para su conservacion, debido a que puede incrementar su vulnerabilidad a actividades antropogenicas como agricultura, pesca y caza. Como resultado, la conservacion de este paujil en las islas del bajo rio Caqueta muy probablemente dependera del apoyo local.

Based on initial range finding, a concentration of 50 mug l(-1) dissolved C-14-microcystin-LR was selected for subsequent time-course experiments. The first was performed in May before the cyanobacterial bloom season and low increases in the radioactivity of particulate fractions occurred with an approx. halving of the cyano-toxin during 4 days. The radioactivity of the dissolved fraction remained stable and there was no significant formation of radiolabelled inorganic carbon. A second time-course experiment was performed in September during the cyanobacterial bloom season. At the end of the four-day incubation period, the microcystin-LR concentration had decreased to an undetectable level and 24% of the added radiolabelled substance was found in different particulate fractions. The study demonstrated that biodegradation of dissolved microcystin-LR occurred in water collected at a lake surface with carbon dioxide as a major end-product. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Contrasting the influence of crop rotation on phosphorus balances and losses in agricultural fields across a tile-drained landscape in Ohio, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Excess phosphorus (P) applied to agricultural fields accumulates in the soil profile and is susceptible to leaching, subsequently impacting adjacent and downstream aquatic ecosystems. Planting a series of crops in a field over a given period of time is considered conservation crop rotation, which may reduce nutrient losses by reducing P inputs (i.e., including crops with lower P requirements) and increasing P demand (i.e., by increasing biodiversity, vegetative land cover, and length of the growing season). Here, we calculated P balances (Inputs-Outputs) in agricultural fields with corn-soybean rotations (CS) and corn-soybean-wheat rotations (CSW) to determine P accumulation or depletion. We then compared P losses, as dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P (TP), between the CS and CSW rotations. Results indicated annual P deficits in CS (median =-9 kg P/ha) and CSW (median =-5 kg P/ha) fields. However, DRP and TP losses persisted and were significantly greater from CSW (median = 0.5 kg DRP/ha and 2 kg TP/ha) compared to CS fields (median = 0.1 kg DRP/ha and 1 kg TP/ha), likely due to elevated soil test phosphorus (STP) concentrations in CSW fields. The fraction of applied P exported from fields as both DRP and TP was also greater in CSW (DRP = 2%; TP = 9%) compared to CS (DRP = 1%; TP = 3%), further confirming more available P susceptible to loss. Findings here highlight the need for further research between conventional and conservation crop rotation on fields with similar STP concentrations and emphasize the importance of P application in accordance with fertility recommendations.																			0380-1330					DEC	2023	49	6							102232	10.1016/j.jglr.2023.09.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2023.09.003		DEC 2023											WOS:001140215800001
J	Pham-Duc, B				Pham-Duc, Binh			Comparison of multi-source satellite remote sensing observations for monitoring the variations of small lakes: a case study of Dai Lai Lake (Vietnam)	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												This study compares the capability of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope (PS) satellites in monitoring the variations of surface water of Dai Lai Lake, located in North Vietnam, for the 2018-2023 period. The analysis involves the utilization of Google Earth Engine to partially process Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 observations, while PS observations are processed using local computers, to generate VH-polarized backscatter coefficient, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Modified of Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) maps. The method for making binary water/non-water maps primarily employs the Otsu algorithm on each single map derived from the previous step. Findings reveal that the lake's water extent remains relatively stable over the 6-year period, and is not strongly affected by the seasonal cycle. Although the spatial distribution patterns of the lake exhibit significant similarity, average water extent of the lake derived from 3-m resolution PS imagery is about 2.17 and 5.60% more than that obtained from 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 imagery, respectively. PS observations are effective for monitoring small lakes, but it is advised to check the quality of its NIR band. Sentinel-2 observations prove great effectiveness for lake monitoring, using both NDWI and MNDWI. For Sentinel-1 observations, potential misclassifications could arise due to similarities in VH-polarized backscatter coefficients between water surfaces and other flat surfaces.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				JAN	2024	15	1					157	170		10.2166/wcc.2023.505	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2023.505		DEC 2023											WOS:001121789500001
J	Qin, YY; Lu, P; Wu, JC				Qin, Yuanyuan; Lu, Ping; Wu, Jicang			Mapping thermokarst lakes in different physical states on the central Tibetan plateau	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												Mapping and monitoring the spatial-temporal evolution of thermokarst lakes on the Tibetan Plateau can significantly contribute to the estimation of climate change impacts on permafrost degradation. Remote sensing-based methods have been developed to monitor the interannual changes of thermokarst lakes. However, the seasonal changes, which are vital for understanding thermokarst lake dynamics, are commonly overlooked. This paper developed automatic methods which integrated the normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) with Markov random field (MRF) for rapid mapping of thermokarst lakes in different physical states characterized by season changes. To validate the effectiveness, the proposed methods were applied to map thermokarst lakes on the central Tibetan Plateau, using four Sentinel-2 images representing different evolutionary states. Specifically, the area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) method was employed to downscale the 20-m short-wave infrared (SWIR) band to 10 m. Using manually digitized lakes as a reference, the proposed methods achieved an average Kappa coefficient of 0.79, significantly outperforming the water index thresholding method that merely attained 0.44. The results corroborate that the proposed methods can be robustly applied in mapping thermokarst lake dynamics with both interannual and seasonal trends on the Tibetan Plateau.																			1753-8947	1753-8955				DEC 8	2023	16	2					4296	4316		10.1080/17538947.2023.2268611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2023.2268611													WOS:001085737000001

It is a pertinent topic to seek both economical and environmentally friendly approaches to minimize the harmful effects of AMD on the environment. Insect larvae are considered a promising solution for pollution treatment. Chironomidae is the most tolerant family to contaminants in pools and its larvae have a strong capacity for metal accumulation from sediment. This paper aimed to evaluate the larvae of Propsilocerus akamusi, a dominant species in the chironomid community, as a new species for entomoremediation in AMD-polluted areas.We detected the toxic effects of AMD on P. akamusi larvae based on their survival and the trace metals bioaccumulation capabilities of P. akamusi larvae. Moreover, we analyzed the expression patterns of four stress-response genes, HSP70, Eno1, HbV, and Hb VII in P. akamusi larvae. Our results revealed that AMD exposure did not significantly affect the survival of the P. akamusi larvae and individuals exposed to some AMD gradients even exhibited higher survival. We also observed the significantly accumulated concentrations of Fe, Ni, and Zn as well as higher bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for Ni and Zn in the P. akamusi larvae exposure to AMD. Induced expression of Eno1 and Hb VII may play important roles in the AMD tolerance of P. akamusi larvae. This study indicated the potential application of P. akamusi larvae in the metal bioremediation of AMD-polluted areas.Statement of environmental implication: Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a global environmental problem related to coal mining activities. AMD pollution has become a long-term, worldwide issue for its interactive and complex stress factors. Bioremediation is an effective method to remove the metals of AMD from wastewater to prevent downstream pollution. However, the disadvantages of the slow growth rate, susceptibility to seasonal changes, difficult post-harvest management, and small biomass of hyperaccumulating plants greatly limit the usefulness of phytoremediation. Insect larvae may be useful candidate organisms to overcome these shortcomings and have been considered a promising pollution solution. Propsilocerus akamusi is a dominant species in the chironomid community and is distributed widely in many lakes of eastern Asia. This species has extraordinary abilities to resist various stresses. This research is the first time to our knowledge to evaluate the application of P. akamusi as a new species in entomoremediation in AMD-contaminated areas.																			0166-445X	1879-1514				JAN	2024	266								106795	10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106795		DEC 2023						38070394					WOS:001134763600001

Seasonal surveys and in situ experiments were conducted to assess the zooplankton community structure and its grazing impact on Cyanothece sp. cells, respectively. Grazing experiments showed that zooplankton can have high grazing impacts on Cyanothece sp., but that increased salinity levels are responsible for the observed decrease in total abundances and the shift to a halotolerant community. Most typical estuarine zooplankton species at St Lucia disappear when salinity increases above 100. Additionally, the halotolerant zooplankton species, specifically Fabrea salina, occurred in low densities at the time of the study. This would result in a major drop of grazing control by zooplankton on Cyanothece sp. The results, which indicate that zooplankton can potentially play a key role in top-down grazing control of cyanobacterial bloom, are relevant in the global context where the occurrence of persistent cyanobacterial blooms is on the rise.

Recent habitat degradation in karstic Lake Uluabat, western Turkey: A coupled limnological-palaeolimnological approach	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The Ramsar site of Lake Uluabat, western Turkey, suffers from eutrophication, urban and industrial pollution and water abstraction, and its water levels are managed artificially. Here we combine monitoring and palaeolimnological. techniques to investigate spatial and temporal limnological variability and ecosystem impact, using an ostracod and mollusc survey to strengthen interpretation of the fossil record. A combination of low invertebrate Biological Monitoring Working Party scores (<10) and the dominance of eutrophic diatoms in the modern lake confirms its poor ecological status. Palaeolimnological analysis of recent (last >200 yr) changes in organic and carbonate content, diatoms, stable isotopes, ostracods and molluscs in a lake sediment core (UL20A) indicates a 20th century trend towards increased sediment accumulation rates and eutrophication which was probably initiated by deforestation and agriculture. The most marked ecological shift occurs in the early 1960s, however. A subtle rise in diatom-inferred total phosphorus and an inferred reduction in submerged aquatic macrophyte cover accompanies a major increase in sediment accumulation rate. An associated marked shift in ostracod stable isotope data indicative of reduced seasonality and a change in hydrological input suggests major impact from artificial water management practices, all of which appears to have culminated in the sustained loss of submerged macrophytes since 2000. The study indicates it is vital to take both land-use and water management practices into account in devising restoration strategies. in a wider context, the results have important implications for the conservation of shallow karstic lakes, the functioning of which is still poorly understood.

Does microorganism stoichiometry predict microbial food web interactions after a phosphorus pulse?	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Knowledge of variations in microbial food web interactions resulting from atmospheric nutrient loads is crucial to improve our understanding of aquatic food web structure in pristine ecosystems. Three experiments mimicking atmospheric inputs at different nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) ratios were performed in situ covering the seasonal biological succession of the pelagic zone in a high-mountain Spanish lake. In all experiments, abundance, biomass, algal cell biovolume, P-incorporation rates, P-cell quota, and N/P ratio of algae strongly responded to P-enrichment, whereas heterotrophic bacteria remained relatively unchanged. Ciliates were severely restricted when a strong algal exploitation of the available P (bloom growth or storage strategies) led to transient (mid-ice-free experiment) or chronic (late ice-free experiment) P-deficiencies in bacteria. In contrast, maximum development of ciliates was reached when bacteria remained P-rich (N/P<20) and algae approached Redfield proportions (N/similar to 16). Evidence of a higher P-incorporation rate supports the proposition that algae and bacteria shifted from a mainly commensalistic-mutualistic to a competitive relationship for the available P when bacterial P-deficiency increased, as reflected by their unbalanced N/P ratio (N/P>20-24). Hence, the bacterial N/P ratio proved be a key factor to understand the algae-bacteria relationship and microbial food web development. This study not only demonstrates the interdependence of life history strategies, stoichiometric nutrient content, and growth but also supports the use of bacterial N/P thresholds for diagnosing ciliate development, a little-studied aspect worthy of further attention.

We used percentiles together with time series analysis for a 40 yr period, with the lower 25% of the quartile designated as the threshold values that indicate drought years. We then used percentiles and Drought Severity Index (DSI) to ascertain the physical conditions and severity of the drought years. The 1980s and 1990s were drier decades (the 1980s had more drought events than any other decade considered in this study), with lower negative anomalies in comparison to the 1960s and 1970s, and the number of drought events and their severity have been increasing in recent years (especially during the 1990s). In general, drought affects the crop planting seasons of March to May (MAM) and September to November (SON), and leads to increased food imports in the years following the drought. If the present trends persist, the Lake Victoria region will face not only more severe drought events, but also significant reductions in food security.

Associated with the seasonal ozone hole in Antarctica, stratospheric ozone depletion occasionally influences the sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel, Argentina) region, enhancing levels of UVB. The primary objective of this work was to study the effects of several (i.e. 6-10) days of exposure to UVB on the taxonomic composition and photosynthetic inhibition of local phytoplankton communities. For different light treatments, fixed-depth incubations placed in an outdoors water tank were compared with incubations in 1900 L mesocosms, where vertical mixing was present. Phytoplankton growth was inhibited by UV radiation (UVR) in fixed-depth experiments but not in the mixed mesocosms. Under fixed and mixed conditions alike, photosynthesis was significantly inhibited by UVB at the beginning of the experiment but no longer after several days of exposure, suggesting that cells had acclimated to radiation conditions. There was a change in species composition in response to UVR exposure in both experiments, which likely explained acclimation. In the community exposed to fixed conditions this change was from a phytoflagellate-dominated assemblage to a community with high relative abundance of diatoms after 6 days of exposure. UVA was responsible for most of the observed growth inhibition; however, the reduction in photosynthesis was produced by UVB. The reasons behind this variability in responses to UVR are associated with species-specific sensitivity and acclimation, and the previous light history of cells. In the community exposed in mesocosms, an assemblage codominated by phytoflagellates and diatoms was observed at the beginning of the experiments. After 10 days of exposure, green algae (Eutreptiella sp.) had increased, and phytoflagellates were the dominant group. The synthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), antioxidant enzymes and photosynthetic antenna pigments, in relation to repair and protection processes, may explain the reduced inhibition of both growth and photosynthesis that was observed in the phytoplankton community after several days of exposure. For environments such as the Beagle Channel seasonally exposed to the ozone hole, the results obtained from the fixed-depth experiments show that species can cope with UVR by means of MAA synthesis, while mixing would primarily promote a change in species composition and defense strategies.

In this study, we explored migration hotspots of the vulnerable Hasu fish in Lake Biwa tributaries using two complementary methods: environmental DNA (eDNA) and visual counts. The study encompassed the known range of Hasu around Lake Biwa tributaries during its reproductive season. Monthly water sampling and visual inspection was conducted, from May to September, in 32 Class A tributaries-at the river mouth and within the river channel. Hasu eDNA was extracted from water samples and quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Environmental factors were also assessed on-site, and their effects on eDNA and visual count trends evaluated using linear models and Akaike information criterion. eDNA was detected at sites where the fish were both observed and not observed. A zero-hurdle model revealed positive correlation between eDNA copies and visual counts of migrating Hasu, with pH having a reducing effect on the relationship (p < 0.05). Analysis of Hasu eDNA copies and visual count trends, with environmental factors as explanatory variables, indicates that Hasu is likely to be found in rivers that are wide and deep enough to accommodate migrating individuals, have fast-flowing currents, and sandy-gravel substrates during reproductive migration. Such rivers are mostly located on the western side of the northern basin and include the Ado, Chinai, and Shiotsuo Rivers. These could be considered as Hasu migration hotspots and require protecting if the population of Hasu in Lake Biwa is to be recovered.

Carbon sequestration potential of four seagrass species Halophila ovalis, Halodule pinifolia, Syringodium isoetifolium and Halodule uninervis in Pulicat Lake, Andhra Pradesh, India was assessed. The mean seagrass biomass within the seagrass beds in the lake ranged from 1.43 +/- 0.06 to 2.01 +/- 0.12 Mg/ ha and the total blue carbon storage in the seagrass meadows ranged from 0.49 +/- 0.15 to 9.52 +/- 0.15 Mg C ha(-1) while stored carbon in the sediment ranged from 1.29 +/- 0.04 to 11.94 +/- 0.15 Mg C ha(-1). Regression analysis showed a considerable correlation between seagrass carbon and sediment carbon. Among the environmental parameters analyzed, pH showed significant correlation with seagrass biomass and sediment carbon (P < 0.05).

The study has a broader applicability to all of Lake Victoria, other African Great Lakes, and all lakes that have riverine discharge. The method presented utilizes water quality and environmental data, local knowledge, and pre-existing literature. The parameters considered were sampled from 2016 to 2018 during the dry season (July sampling) and the wet season (March sampling). Separation power of Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05) qualified 11 discriminant metrics for both macroinvertebrate and fish samples into the scoring system of 1, 3 and 5 in the formulation of final Multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity methodological approach. Rivers in the northern section had lower Multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity methodological approach scores, as compared to southern counterparts. The Multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity methodological approach ranking herein was validated by community perceptions on pollution levels. River Nzoia catchment emerged as the most polluted, followed by River Yala, River Kuja, and Sondu-Miriu. Siltation, domestic washing, litter and refuse emerged as the main agents of pollution. Management authorities ought to reinforce a balanced utilization of the vital water resources to minimize future impacts, and promote catchment wide practices that ensure ecological health sustainability of the lake ecosystem.

To do this, it is necessary to understand the species' population ecology. Four surveys of zooplankton were conducted in May, August, and December 2018 and February 2019 in the Pearl River Delta, China, to examine the population characteristics of B. calyciflorus. The temporal and spatial distribution of abundance, biomass, dominance, and occurrence frequency were compared with those from 2012 to investigate the relationship between changes in the population of B. calyciflorus and environmental factors. The average abundance, dominance, and occurrence of B. calyciflorus in this survey were significantly higher than those of 2012 in all seasons. Principal component analysis showed that environmental factors such as the temperature, transparency, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus of water had a major impact on the abundance of B. calyciflorus. There was a significant positive correlation with transparency, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus of water, and a very significant positive correlation with water temperature. Overall, these results demonstrated that the distribution characteristics of B. calyciflorus can reflect pollution in water bodies and can be used to evaluate water quality. These research results provide a reference for evaluating China's river health and can help to manage water quality in the Pearl River Delta.					li, ziqi/JDC-9141-2023; Gao, yuan/HLH-1794-2023															2073-4441				MAR	2021	13	6							749	10.3390/w13060749	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13060749													WOS:000651938900001

Simulated effects of a seasonal precipitation change on the vegetation in tropical Africa	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Pollen data collected in Africa at high (Kuruyange, valley swamp, Burundi) and low altitude (Victoria, lake, Uganda; Ngamakala, pond, Congo) showed that after 6 ky before present (BP), pollen of deciduous trees increase their relative percentage, suggesting thus the reduction of the annual amount of precipitation and/or an increase of in the length of the dry season. Until now, pollen-climate transfer functions only investigated mean annual precipitation, due to the absence of modern pollen-assemblage analogs under diversified precipitation regimes. Hence these functions omit the potential effect of a change in precipitation seasonality modifying thus the length of the dry season. In the present study, we use an equilibrium biosphere model (i.e. BIOME3.5) to estimate the sensitivity of equatorial African vegetation, at specific sites, to such changes. Climatic scenarios, differing only in the monthly distribution of the current annual amount of precipitation, are examined at the above three locations in equatorial Africa. Soil characteristics, monthly temperatures and cloudiness are kept constant at their present-day values. Good agreement is shown between model simulations and current biomes assemblages, as inferred from pollen data. To date, the increase of the deciduous forest component in the palaeodata around 6 ky BP has been interpreted as the beginning of a drier climate period. However, our results demonstrate that a change in the seasonal distribution of precipitation could also induce the observed changes in vegetation types. This study confirms the importance of taking into account seasonal changes in the hydrological balance. Palaeoecologists can greatly benefit from the use of dynamic process based vegetation models to acccount for modification of the length of the dry season when they wish to reconstruct vegetation composition or to infer quantitative climate parameters, such as temperature and precipitation, from pollen or vegetation proxy.					; Guiot, Joel/G-7818-2011	Guiot, Joel/0000-0001-7345-4466; Gritti, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7119-1287; Flores, Olivier/0000-0002-1416-0449; Gritti, Emmanuel S./0000-0002-0276-953X													1814-9324	1814-9332					2010	6	2					169	178		10.5194/cp-6-169-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-6-169-2010													WOS:000277185200004

The lakes were classified into three types based on their origin and geographical characteristics: non-marine relic lakes, marine relic and lotic lakes, and marine relic and lentic lakes. We describe the physicochemical characteristics of each lake type. When the non-marine relic lakes were partly covered with ice, the water column was stratified beneath the ice. In the non-marine relic lakes, during the season with no ice cover, physicochemical parameters were uniform throughout the water column, probably due to frequent vertical mixing induced by wind force and thermal convection within the shallow basins. Similarly, in marine relic and lotic lakes, lake waters appeared to be completely mixed because of a large inflow of meltwater from glaciers and outflow to other lakes and the coastal sea. In the marine relic and lentic lakes, except for Lake Himebati-ike, the lake water was vertically stratified with a strong halocline. In Lakes Suribati-ike and Hunazoko-ike, salinity was very high ( up to 20%) due to evapoconcentration. Lake Suribati-ike is a meromictic lake, with a monimolimnion developed below 10 m water depth.

Implications for chloro- and pheopigment synthesis and preservation from combined compound-specific δ13C, δ15N, and Δ14C analysis	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Chloropigments and their derivative pheopigments preserved in sediments can directly be linked to photosynthesis. Their carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic compositions have been shown to be a good recorder of recent and past surface ocean environmental conditions tracing the carbon and nitrogen sources and dominant assimilation processes of the phytoplanktonic community. In this study we report results from combined compound-specific radiocarbon and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to examine the time-scales of synthesis and fate of chlorophyll-a and its degradation products pheophytin-a, pyropheophytin-a, and 13(2),17(3)-cyclopheophorbide-a-enol until burial in Black Sea core-top sediments. The pigments are mainly of marine phytoplanktonic origin as implied by their stable isotopic compositions. Pigment delta N-15 values indicate nitrate as the major uptake substrate but N-15-depletion towards the open marine setting indicates either contribution from N-2-fixation or direct uptake of ammonium from deeper waters. Radiocarbon concentrations translate into minimum and maximum pigment ages of approximately 40 to 1200 years. This implies that protective mechanisms against decomposition such as association with minerals, storage in deltaic anoxic environments, or eutrophication-induced hypoxia and light limitation are much more efficient than previously thought. Moreover, seasonal variations of nutrient source, growth period, and habitat and their associated isotopic variability are likely at least as strong as long-term trends. Combined triple isotope analysis of sedimentary chlorophyll and its primary derivatives is a powerful tool to delineate biogeochemical and diagenetic processes in the surface water and sediments, and to assess their precise time-scales.					; Ogawa, Nanako/AAJ-6456-2020; Ohkouchi, Naohiko/B-2071-2008; Kashiyama, Yuichiro/AAW-1036-2020; Kusch, Stephanie/M-8218-2015; Mollenhauer, Gesine/AAD-8167-2019; Mollenhauer, Gesine/B-5190-2015; Friedrich, Jana/AAG-4840-2021	Ohkouchi, Naohiko/0000-0002-6355-7469; OGAWA, Nanako O/0000-0002-3823-6444; Kashiyama, Yuichiro/0000-0001-7337-2209; Kusch, Stephanie/0000-0002-2708-4975; Butzin, Martin/0000-0002-9275-7304; Altabet, Mark/0000-0003-3120-0710; Mollenhauer, Gesine/0000-0001-5138-564X; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2010	7	12					4105	4118		10.5194/bg-7-4105-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-7-4105-2010													WOS:000285574100013

Understanding How Reservoir Operations Influence Methane Emissions: A Conceptual Model	WATER												Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), understanding controls on methane emissions from reservoirs is an important goal. Yet, reservoirs are complex ecosystems, and mechanisms by which reservoir operations influence methane emissions are poorly understood. In part, this is because emissions occur in 'hot spots' and 'hot moments'. In this study, we address three research questions, 'What are the causal pathways through which reservoir operations and resulting water level fluctuations (WLF) influence methane emissions?'; 'How do influences from WLF differ for seasonal drawdown and diurnal hydropeaking operations?'; and 'How does understanding causal pathways inform practical options for mitigation?'. A graphical conceptual model is presented that links WLF in reservoirs to methane emissions via four causal pathways: (1) water-column mixing (2) drying-rewetting cycles, (3) sediment delivery and redistribution, and (4) littoral vegetation. We review what is known about linkages for WLF at seasonal and diurnal resolutions generate research questions, and hypothesize strategies for moderating methane emissions by interrupting each causal pathway. Those related to flow management involve basin-scale management of tributary flows, seasonal timing of hydropeaking (pathway #1), timing and rates of drawdown (pathway #2). In addition, we describe how sediment (pathway #3) and vegetation management (pathway #4) could interrupt linkages between WLF and emissions. We demonstrate the strength of conceptual modeling as a tool for generating plausible hypotheses and suggesting mitigation strategies. Future research is needed to develop simpler models at appropriate timescales that can be validated and used to manage flow releases from reservoirs.					; Hansen, Carly/AAW-5192-2021; Jager, Henriette/OGQ-5439-2025; Griffiths, Natalie/C-3087-2012; Matson, Paul/AAB-9767-2019	Matson, Paul/0000-0003-2105-7308; Pilla, Rachel/0000-0001-9156-9486; Jager, Henriette/0000-0003-4253-533X; Griffiths, Natalie/0000-0003-0068-7714; 														2073-4441				DEC	2023	15	23							4112	10.3390/w15234112	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15234112													WOS:001116612800001

Distribution of geochemical forms and bioavailability of phosphorus in the surface sediments of Beypore Estuary, southwestern coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Nutrient management in shallow transitional aquatic systems is very complex due to the sediment-water exchange, especially for phosphorus. The present study tries to get an in-depth understanding of the distribution of geochemical forms of phosphorus in the surface sediments of Beypore Estuary, a tropical estuarine system in southwest India, which has been subjected to immense climate change in recent times. Total phosphorus in the sediments was found to be abysmally lower (76.8 to 889.12 mu g/g) than those reported for other tropical estuaries. Organic-bound phosphorus constituted the majority of the total phosphorus in the sediments, and unlike other tropical estuaries, iron-bound and calcium-bound phosphorus were minor fractions in the study region. However, the bioavailable phosphorus was consistent throughout the study period and varied from 16.5 to 51.0% of total phosphorus. This reveals the active phosphorus buffering in the Beypore Estuary even in the absence of an external source. Statistical evaluation of two contrasting seasons (low and high runoff periods) could illustrate the major biogeochemical pathways for phosphorus in the Beypore Estuary. This study highlights the significant role of hydrographical parameters in regulating phosphorus bioavailability in this estuary; therefore, any modifications to the same by climate change could make nutrient management even more challenging.					; K.R., Renjith/AAF-5824-2020	Joseph, Cindrella Joy/0009-0003-9163-2619; K R, Renjith/0000-0002-1626-4479													0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2023	195	12							1458	10.1007/s10661-023-12054-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-12054-3								37950836					WOS:001100910000001

Utilizing an efficient technique to swiftly extract lake ice information is crucial in the field of lake ice research. The Bayesian ensemble change detection (BECD) algorithm stands out as a powerful tool, requiring no threshold compared to other algorithms and, instead, utilizing the probability of abrupt changes to detect positions. This method is predominantly employed by automatically extracting change points from time series data, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy, especially in revealing phenological and seasonal characteristics. This paper focuses on Bosten Lake (BL) and employs PMRS data in conjunction with the Bayesian change detection algorithm. It introduces an automated method for extracting LIP information based on the Bayesian change detection algorithm. In this study, the BECD algorithm was employed to extract lake ice phenology information from passive microwave remote sensing data on Bosten Lake. The reliability of the passive microwave remote sensing data was further investigated through cross-validation with MOD10A1 data. Additionally, the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test was applied to analyze the trends in lake ice phenology changes in Bosten Lake. Spatial variations were examined using MOD09GQ data. The results indicate: (1) The Bayesian change detection algorithm (BCDA), in conjunction with PMRS data, offers a high level of accuracy and reliability in extracting the lake ice freezing and thawing processes. It accurately captures the phenological parameters of BL's ice. (2) The average start date of lake ice freezing is in mid-December, lasting for about three months, and the start date of ice thawing is usually in mid-March. The freezing duration (FD) of lake ice is relatively short, shortening each year, while the thawing speed is faster. The stability of the lake ice complete ice cover duration is poor, averaging 84 days. (3) The dynamic evolution of BL ice is rapid and regionally distinct, with the lake center, southwest, and southeast regions being the earliest areas for ice formation and thawing, while the northwest coastal and Huang Shui Gou areas experience later ice formation. (4) Since 1978, BL's ice has exhibited noticeable trends: the onset of freezing, the commencement of thawing, complete thawing, and full freezing have progressively advanced in regard to dates. The periods of full ice coverage, ice presence, thawing, and freezing have all shown a tendency toward shorter durations. This study introduces an innovative method for LIP extraction, opening up new prospects for the study of lake ecosystem and strategy formulation, which is worthy of further exploration and application in other lakes and regions.

Virophages are small dsDNA viruses that parasitize giant viruses (e.g., Mimiviridae), which in turn affect unicellular eukaryotes. We analyzed eight viromes obtained from the deep-water areas of three basins of Lake Baikal and the shallow-water strait Maloye More in different seasons. The sequences of virophages were revealed in all viromes and were dominant after bacteriophages and algal viruses. Sixteen putative complete genomes of virophages were assembled, all of which contained four conserved genes encoding major capsid protein (MCP), minor capsid protein (mCP), maturation cysteine protease (PRO), and FtsK-HerA family DNA-packaging ATPase (ATPase). The MCP-based cluster analysis showed a sequence separation according to seasons, and a dependence on the geographical localization was not detected.

Microbial Community Composition as an Indicator of the State of Basins Located at the Sea Coast (Exemplified by the Kanda Bay, Kandalaksha Gulf, White Sea)	MICROBIOLOGY												Formation of the Kanda Bay resulted from construction of a railway dam (1916) and subsequent isolation of the sea lagoon from the main basin of the Kandalaksha Gulf, White Sea. Decreased action of tidal flows, which mix the water column of the lagoon, altered the hydrological regime of the basin. Decreased water exchange resulted in formation of oxygen-depleted near-bottom water and to sulfide contamination. A freshwater lake was, however, preserved in the southern part of the Kanda Bay. The composition of microbial communities was studied for the near-bottom water horizons at different sides of the Kanda Bay. The oxygen regime in this layer was found to change, with increasing concentrations of sulfide and methane and active processes of sulfate reduction and methane oxidation. The composition of the microbial community changed noticeably, with lower abundance of true marine and freshwater microorganisms and development of bacteria and archaea predominant in microbial communities of anoxic water in meromictic basins. Among the microbial diversity, indicator species with increased abundance were revealed. These are archaea of the genera Methanoregula and Methanosaeta (phylum Halobacterota). The sulfur cycle microorganisms, which were the indicators of stagnant marine water, included anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria of the class Chlorobia, (Chlorobium phaeovibrioides, Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme), Chloroflexi of the genus Chloronema, nonsulfur purple bacteria related to the genus Rhodoferax, colorless sulfur bacteria of the family Beggiatoaceae, and sulfur oxidizers of the genus Thiobacillus. Archaea of the genus Nitrosopumilus (phylum Crenarchaeota) and bacteria of the genus Woeseia may be considered opposites to the indicator microorganisms, since they were found only in the open sea water. In our opinion, stable water exchange through the dam will result in the stable composition of the Kanda Bay microbial community, with only seasonal variations and year-to-year fluctuations. The negative scenario supports prediction of conversion of the Kanda Bay into a stratified basin with anoxic near-bottom water and the microbial community similar to that found in meromictic lakes.

However, current studies tend to split SGL changes into melt/non-melt seasons, ignoring the effect of buried lakes in the exploration of drainage, and the existing threshold-based approach to SGL extraction in a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is influenced by the choice of the study area mask. In this study, a new method (Otsu-Canny-Otsu (OCO)), which accesses the features of SGLs on optical and SAR images objectively, is proposed for full-year SGL extraction with Google Earth Engine (GEE). The SGLs on the Petermann Glacier were monitored well by OCO throughout 2021, including buried lakes and more detailed rapid drainage events. Some SGLs' extent varied minimally in a year (area varying by 10-25%) while some had very rapid drainage (a rapid drainage event from July 26 to 30). The SGL extraction results were influenced by factors such as the mode of polarization, the surface environment, and the depth of the lake. The OCO method can provide a more comprehensive analysis for SGL changes throughout the year.					; ZHOU, Chunxia/AAU-2909-2020; Zhang, Ce/J-4906-2019; Zhu, Yikai/AAW-6284-2021	Zhu, Yikai/0000-0002-6613-0188; Zhu, Dongyu/0009-0000-5773-1371; Zhang, Ce/0000-0001-5100-3584														2072-4292				DEC	2023	15	24							5726	10.3390/rs15245726	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15245726													WOS:001130533300001

Depth distribution of zooplankton in relation to limnological gradients under different stratification and interannual regimes in a deep, tropical crater lake	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Zooplankton vertical distribution was studied in Lake Bosumtwi to understand how spatial and temporal variations in the water column affected diurnal and nocturnal patterns. Biweekly samples were collected for 24 consecutive months at the deepest point from 2005 to 2006. Water column properties shaping habitat suitability, namely temperature, light intensity, dissolved oxygen and phytoplankton biomass, varied markedly with depth but less with season. Most zooplankton stayed in the epilimnion continuously and their distribution was unaltered by lake stratification, mixing and restratification. Species dwelt permanently in the epilimnion without any necessity to migrate. Reduced water column variability and resultant weak selective pressures suppressed greater dispersion of species. Chaoborus ceratopogones (Theobald) was the main invertebrate predator and performed upward and downward movements on a diel cycle. Competing prey species overlapped extensively in spatial and temporal degree of habitat use. Chaoborus, however, segregated in deep water during the day, thereby minimizing prey vulnerability and promoting coexistence among predators and prey. During night-time residence, prey species may be exposed to increased predation risk from Chaoborus but gains in reproductive potential in warm, food-rich surface waters may offset losses to mortality. Our results suggest that high degree of habitat constancy and consequently weak selective pressures contributed to the lowered behavioural responses of zooplankton. The persistently skewed distribution of zooplankton is adaptive to predation and competition and promotes species coexistence. This behaviour will optimize growth and reproductive benefits over the cost of descent to suboptimal conditions in deep water.

Moreover, the variation in phosphorous fraction was investigated through mineralogical studies like grain size analysis and X-ray diffraction. The findings revealed that the surficial sediment of lakes are least influenced by anthropogenic sources, since a slight increase in each of the P-Fractions was observed from year 2011 to 2012, except organic P. Loosely sorbed exchangeable phosphorous was found to be slightly high which was due to difference in atmospheric precipitation, which is one of the strong factors in high altitude regions. Decrease in organic fraction of P indicated that lakes became more oligotrophic in nature. Mineralogical investigation shows that illite-montmorillonite and montmorillonite are the main minerals in Sella Lake, whereas montmorillonite and graphite are main minerals in P.T.Tso lake. Factor analysis of seasonal data of P fractionation in surface sediments, along with physical parameters of Sella Lake water indicates three factors for the 2011 data principle factors are pH, EC, oxide-bound and organic P. Factor analysis of P.T.Tso lake water indicates three factors for the 2011 data with principle factors are adsorbed P and authigenic P, pH, oxide-bound P. This study shows that except organic fractions all other fractions are increasing in the following year. It implies that even at such remote high altitude locations P characteristics are changing year to year which sought for further investigation and enables HALs to show the early impacts of climate change related changes. A clear influence of long range transported air pollutants has been found through HYSPLIT back trajectory models which needs to be substantiated through long-term monitoring.					; AL, Ramanathan/E-7217-2012	Prakash, Amit/0000-0001-9064-6590; Kumar, Manish/0000-0002-3351-7298; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2015	73	11					7617	7629		10.1007/s12665-014-3931-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3931-0													WOS:000354712300068

Spatio-temporal variability of five surface water quality parameters in the Swartvlei estuarine lake system, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Variability of salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity in the temporarily open/closed Swartvlei estuarine system, measured from 1991 to 2013, was investigated at various temporal (seasonal, estuarine open/closed phase, long-term) and spatial (inter- and intra-waterbody) scales. Longitudinal pH and salinity gradients, and seasonal variability of temperature and dissolved oxygen, were typical of many southern African estuaries. Differences to comparable systems occurred with respect to temperature range, and within-system variability of salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen. The influence of differing marine and freshwater inflows, and of submerged macrophyte composition and biomass, on such variability are discussed. No significant long-term changes occurred in salinity or pH up until 2006. Significant freshwater flooding in mid-2006 and late 2007, and following increases in open-mouth conditions, resulted in significant decreases in pH in both Swartvlei Estuary and Swartvlei Lake, and increases in salinity throughout the system. Long-term declines in turbidity occurred in Swartvlei Estuary throughout the study period. No long-term changes in water temperature were recorded. Long-term data indicate that the Swartvlei system is not undergoing a rapid deterioration in water quality, but rather exhibiting both short- and long-term fluxes characteristic of estuarine systems.																			1608-5914	1727-9364				JUN	2015	40	2					119	131		10.2989/16085914.2015.1029868	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2015.1029868													WOS:000356798800002

Chick mortality leads to male-biased sex ratios in endangered Great Lakes Piping Plovers	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Few investigators have studied the offspring sex ratios of monomorphic shorebirds because visually determining the sex of juveniles is not possible. We investigated the ontogeny of an observed male-biased adult sex ratio in the federally endangered Great Lakes population of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus). We determined sex ratios at hatching, banding (x<overbar></mml:mover> = 9.0 d old), and fledging (23 d old) to determine if the bias arises during the pre-fledging period and, if so, at what stage. For three consecutive years (2012-2014), we used a molecular technique to determine the sex of 307 chicks and followed individuals to a stage where survival to fledging could be inferred. Within fully-sexed broods at hatching, the average proportions of male chicks (2012-2014) were 0.47, 0.58, and 0.54, respectively. At banding, the sex ratio remained unbiased in 2012 (0.51), but was male-biased in 2013 (0.59) and 2014 (0.57). Overall, the sex ratio did not differ significantly from parity at fledging in 2012, but did differ during 2013 (P = 0.01) and 2014 (P = 0.03). Using logistic regression models fit using Bayesian inference, we found strong support for a sex effect on chick survival to fledging age, with higher male than female survival ((male) = 0.83 [95% credible interval: 0.75-0.90]; (female) = 0.71 [0.61-0.80]). These results suggest that the male-biased adult sex ratio in Piping Plovers arises, in part, due to differential survival during the pre-fledging period. This difference did not result from female chicks hatching later in the season or weighing less at banding than male chicks, factors that could potentially affect the likelihood of survival. Future investigations into possible behavioral- or weather-related influences on sex-specific survival are needed. Our results have important implications for (1) identifying management efforts needed to increase recruitment given female-biased chick mortality, and (2) conducting population viability analyses, which frequently assume an unbiased fledgling sex ratio. RESUMEN La mortalidad de pichones conduce a tasa de sexos sesgada hacia los machos en el amenazada Chorlo chiflador Pocos investigadores han estudiado la tasa de sexos de las cria de aves marinas monomorficas debido a que la determinacion visual del sexo de los juveniles no es posible. Investigamos la ontogenia en la poblacion con estatus Amenazada a nivel Federal de los Grandes Lagos del Chorlo chiflador (Charadrius melodus) que presenta una tasa se sexos sesgada hacia los machos en adultos. Determinamos la tasa de sexos al nacer, al momento de anillarlos (<mml:mover>x<mml:mo><overbar></mml:mover> = 9.0 dias de edad), y cuando son volantones (23 dia de edad) para determinar si el sesgo surge durante el periodo pre-volanton y, si es asi, en que estadio. Durante tres anos consecutivos (2012-2014), utilizamos una tecnica molecular para determinar el sexo de 307 pichones y seguimos a los individuos a un estadio donde la superviviencia a volanton podia ser inferida. Dentro de cada nidada completamente sexada al nacer, la proporcion relativa de pichones macho (2012-2014) fue de 0.47, 0.58, y 0.54, respectivamente. Al momento del anillado, la tasa de sexos permanecio sin sesgo en 2012 (0.51), pero se encontro sesgada hacia los machos en 2013 (0.59) y 2014 (0.57). En general, la tasa de sexos no difirio significativamente de la igualdad en los volantones en 2012, pero si difirio durante el 2013 (P = 0.01) y el 2014 (P = 0.03). Usando modelos de ajuste a regresion logistica usando inferencia bayesiana, encontramos fuerte soporte para un efecto del sexo en la superviviencia de los pichones hacia la edad de volanton, siendo mas alta la superviviencia de machos que de hembras ((machos) = 0.83 [95% intervalo de credibilidad: 0.75-0.90]; (hembras) = 0.71 [0.61-0.80]). Estos resultados sugieren que el sesgo en la tasa de sexos hacia los machos en el Chorlo chiflador surge, en parte, debido a una superviviencia diferencial durante el periodo pre-volanton. Estas diferencias no se debieron a que las hembras nacieran mas tarde en la temporada o a que pesaran menos que los machos durante el anillado, factores que podrian potencialmente afectar la probabilidad de la superviviencia. Futuras investigaciones sobre las posibles influencias comportamentales o dependientes del clima en la superviviencia sexo-especifica son necesarias. Nuestros resultados tienen importantes implicancias para (1) identificar esfuerzos de manejo necesarios a fin de incrementar el reclutamiento dada la mortalidad sesgada hacia las hembras de los pichones, y (2) llevar a cabo analisis de viabilidad poblacional, que frecuentemente asumen una tasa de sexos sin sesgo.

Estimating snow depletion curves for American River basins using distributed snow modeling	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We used a well evaluated temperature-based distributed energy balance model for snow accumulation and ablation with a 1 km x 1 km resolution to derive estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow cover area (SCA) for the American River basin during the water years 1960-1999. These model prognostic variables were then used to derive and analyze the properties of the snow depletion curves (SDC) of the drainage basins of the three Forks of the American River. Such curves are commonly used in spatially lumped model applications as a priori estimates that account for the areal heterogeneities of the snow pack. Assuming that SDC can be derived for a basin and the annual variability is small, a single SDC offers an adequate description of the snow pack area distribution. Unique model-derived SDC were obtained for each Fork but with large interannual variability. The curve variability introduces large uncertainty in the prediction of snowmelt timing and magnitude when spatially lumped models are used. Further analysis of the model derived SDC showed significant correlation between the maximum annual SWE of the basin and the SWE values for a given SCA. In addition, the maximum annual SWE of the basin is also correlated with the SWE from snow courses surveys conducted in the beginning of March. These empirical relationships provide a procedure to estimate the SDC at the beginning of the melting season and, therefore, reduce the uncertainty in snowmelt estimation associated with the use of SDC.

The spectrum analysis identifies a power period of 1.5 to 7 years in sampled POPs data in the Great Lakes (GL) and Arctic in the 1990s to 2000s, coinciding with the power period of two climate variabilities, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Results also reveal a decadal power period in monitored POPs time series, which is associated with air temperature and climate indices, demonstrating the connection between the dominant long-term trend in sampled POPs data and climate change. We used a "cocktail party effect" and Fast Independent Component Analysis approaches to blindly separate and isolate the signals in POPs time series from different dynamic and environmental processes in the Arctic and the GL. Among seasonal, interannual, and decadal or longer-term signals extracted from sampled POPs concentration data, the climate signals in hexachlorobenzene in the GL are associated with air temperature, El Nino-Southern Oscillation indices, and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The signals in a-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and polychlorinated biphenyls observations at three Arctic sites correspond to a Nino 3.4 and the NAO. The other two signals are associated with the longer term and seasonal cycle of POPs. We show that the seasonal cycle and climate change are important factors, buffering the declining trend of alpha-HCH. The signals feature extraction from POPs historical data provides a tool to deconstruct the POPs time series and enhance our understanding of the potential effects of climate variations on POPs environmental cycling.

Interest in detailed analysis of the circulation, biotic, and abiotic factors affecting the lagoon and its limnology is a result of the opening of the new mouth on 23 September 2000 to resolve the threat to its environment from various factors-eutrophication, weed proliferation, siltation, industrial pollution, and depletion of bioresources. This paper describes the development of a two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic model for Chilika Lagoon and the resulting simulation of currents and salinity corresponding to (i) the Southwest and Northeast monsoon seasons and (ii) pre- and post mouth-opening conditions. Numerical experiments are performed to understand the different factors-wind, tides and freshwater influx-and their independent and collective roles. Comparison of results obtained with one or both of the openings is made to quantify and validate the changing salinity pattern, which has improved the productivity of the lagoon. Our study shows the salinity levels to be much lower during the southwest monsoon compared to the northeast monsoon, which is validated by observations. The decrease in salinity is attributed to more freshwater influx during the southwest monsoon. There is a significant increase (14%-66%, depending on the sector) in salinity after opening of the new mouth, the maximum change being observed in the channel that connects the lagoon to the sea. The constriction in the lagoon that blocks the tidal effects entering the lagoon is found to be responsible for maintaining the main body of the lagoon with low salinity. The dynamic model will be an important input for our on going work in seasonal study of the ecology of Chilika Lagoon.					; MOHANTY, PRATAP/E-8254-2014	Mohanty, Pratap Kumar/0000-0002-1188-2008; Gorozabel, Robinson/0000-0001-5822-5411; 													0749-0208					JUL	2007	23	4					861	877		10.2112/04-0225R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/04-0225R.1													WOS:000248015400005

In the vertical water column of lakes with high solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) and invertebrate predators, zooplankton face two particularly strong and conflicting selective pressures. During daylight hours invertebrate predators often induce an upward vertical migration of zooplankton prey while potentially damaging UV forces a downward migration. We used 2.2 m long columns suspended vertically in a lake to conduct 2x2 factorial experiments to examine patterns of depth selection behavior by zooplankton in the presence and absence of both the invertebrate predator Chaoborus and UV. We hypothesized that Chaoborus and UV both affect the distribution of zooplankton and a combination of both factors would lead to a narrowing of depth distribution. We found that when Chaoborus were present zooplankton tended to be distributed at shallower depths in the columns, while in the presence of UV they exhibited a deeper distribution. Chaoborus themselves were always found near the bottom of the columns regardless of the UV treatment. Simultaneous exposure to predators and UV resulted in a peak of zooplankton (especially Daphnia catawba) distribution at intermediate depths. In a significant number of cases, depth range was narrowed in response to Chaoborus, UV, or both.

Total species richness was five (prevalence = Haemobartonella sp. 63.9%, Bartonella spp. 27.7%, Babesia microti 9.0%, Trypanosoma sp. 8.4% and and Hepatozoon lavieri 3.1%) with 76.9% of the voles carrying at least one species and a mean infracommunity species richness of 1.1. Variation in species richness was determined primarily by season and year, the interaction of these factors, and that of year with host age. The observed frequency distribution of infracommunity species richness did not differ from that predicted by a null model, suggesting that there were no marked associations between the species. Analyses of prevalence and abundance of infection with each species in turn, revealed that overall the principal causes of variation were temporal and seasonal, their interaction, and interactions with intrinsic factors (age and sex), the latter playing only a minor role in their own right. However, the relative importance of these combinations varied and was distinct for each of the species in the study. Prevalence data revealed eight sets of two- and three-way associations between species, mostly dependent to some extent on one of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the model. Analysis of quantitative associations suggested two sets of positive two-way interactions, none of which remained after controlling for the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on the abundance of each species. These data are discussed in the context of the changing ecological profiles in this region of Eastern Europe and, in a wider context, in relation to current understanding of the factors that shape component community structures of haemoparasites in wild rodents.					; Pawelczyk, Agnieszka/M-4934-2018; Gilbert, Francis/K-3817-2013; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015; Pawełczyk, Agnieszka/M-4934-2018	Gilbert, Francis/0000-0002-2727-4103; Pawelczyk, Agnieszka/0000-0001-9336-8258; Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; 													0932-0113	1432-1955				MAR	2004	92	4					270	284		10.1007/s00436-003-1040-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-003-1040-1								14714180					WOS:000220490900002
J	Nasri, AB; Bouaïcha, N; Fastner, J				Nasri, AB; Bouaïcha, N; Fastner, J			First report of a microcystin-containing bloom of the cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. in Lake Oubeira, eastern Algeria	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Lake Oubeira has been used as the main source of drinking water for many communities in the East of Algeria. In this lake, nutrient loading coupled with year-round warm weather favors the growth of cyanobacteria, several of which can produce cyanotoxins, especially the potent liver toxins called microcystins (MCYSTs). The present study evaluated microcystin levels and characterized the different microcystin variants present in the raw water during a 17-month period (April 2000-September 2001), as measured by protein phosphatase inhibition assays and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, respectively. The results showed that microcystin concentrations in the lake water varied between 3 and 29,163 mug microcystin-LR equivalent per liter. The microscopic examination of the phytoplankton samples showed the dominance of the Microcystis genus in the cyanobacterial bloom. The highest MCYST concentration was observed in August 2001, at 29,163 mug/l. Therefore, the highest total MCYST content per phytoplankton biomass was found in August 2001, with 4,590 mug MCYST-LR equivalents/g dried bloom material. Analysis of the field bloom extract by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of four variants of microcystins: microcystin-LR (MCYST-LR), microcystin-YR (MCYST-YR), microcystin-RR (MCYST-RR), and a demethylated variant of MCYST-LR (D-MCYST-LR).

Three experimental diets were formulated: the control (cyanobacteria free diet); one test diet with cyanobacteria from Lake Taihu (AMt 80.0 mu g MCs g(-1) diet) and one with cyanobacteria from Lake Dianchi (AMd, 410.0 rho g MCs g(-1) diet). Each diet was fed to fish for 60 days and then all fish were free of cyanobacteria for another 55 days. A significant increase in feeding rate (FR) was observed in fish fed AMd diet after a first 30-day exposure (1(st) EP), and in fish fed both AMt diet and AMd diet after a second 30-day exposure (2(nd) EP). Specific growth rates (SGR) of fish fed AMt diet and AMd diet were both obviously affected after the first 30-day exposure, but SGR was only significantly affected in fish fed AMt diet after the second 30-day exposure. After a 55-day recovery, there were no significant differences among diets in the indices mentioned above. Much higher concentrations of MCs were accumulated in tissues of all fish exposed to cyanobacteria. After the 55-day recovery, MC concentrations in fish tissues were significantly lower than those on day 60. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High Lake gossan deposit: An Arctic analogue for ancient Martian surficial processes?	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												Gossan samples collected during a reconnaissance expedition to High Lake in Nunavut, Canada, were analyzed to determine their mineral components and to define parameters for the geochemical environment in which they formed. The gossan represents a natural acid drainage site in an arctic environment that serves as an analogue to the conditions under which sulfate and Fe-oxide possibly formed on Mars. Rock and soil samples were taken from three different outcrops and analyzed using XRD, SEM/EDS and Mossbauer. Two main mineral assemblages were observed. The first assemblage, which was found primarily in samples from the first outcrop, contained chlorite, Fe-phosphates, Fe-oxide and quartz. The second assemblage, which was found at the second and third outcrops, was primarily quartz, mica and jarosite. One sample (G41), containing Fe-oxide, jarosite and gypsum, appears to be transitional between a Fe-oxide dominant assemblage to a jarosite dominant assemblage. Thermodynamic equilibria predicts that the gossan pore water should range from mildly acidic, relatively sulfate-poor (pH 3-6; SO4 <1000 mg l(-1)) to highly acidic and relatively sulfate-rich (pH 0.5-3; SO4 >3000 mg l(-1)) for the first and second mineral assemblages, respectively. Kinetic reaction models indicate that the second assemblage replaces the first during evaporation or freezing of water. Compared to acid mine drainage (AMD) sites located in temperate regions, the arctic High Lake gossan lacks diversity in sulfate species and has smaller diagenetic crystal sizes. The smaller crystal size may reflect the slower reaction rates at colder temperatures and the seasonal water saturation. These initial results indicate that the High Lake gossan deposit does record mechanisms for which minerals like hematite, goethite, gypsum and jarosite, which are found on Mars, can form in an environment that involves seasonal water occurrence in a cold climate.

J	Devine, JA; Vanni, MJ				Devine, JA; Vanni, MJ			Spatial and seasonal variation in nutrient excretion by benthic invertebrates in a eutrophic reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fluxes via excretion by benthic invertebrates were quantified in a eutrophic reservoir (Acton Lake, Ohio, U.S.A.). We quantified variation in nutrient fluxes seasonally (June until November 1997), spatially (three sites) and among taxa (chironomids, tubificid oligochaetes and Chaoborus ). 2. The three taxa differed in spatial distribution and contribution to nutrient fluxes. Tubificids were the most abundant taxon at two oxic sites (1.5 and 4 m depth), and were exceedingly rare at an anoxic, hypolimnetic site (8 m). Chironomids were abundant only at the shallowest oxic site. Chaoborus was the only abundant taxon at the anoxic site. Total benthic invertebrate biomass was greatest at the shallowest site and lowest at the anoxic, hypolimnetic site. 3. Mass-specific excretion rate [mumol NH(4) -N or soluble reactive P (SRP) excreted mg dry mass(-1) h(-1)] varied among experiments and was influenced by temperature. Differences among taxa were not significant. Thus, nutrient flux through benthic invertebrates was affected more by total invertebrate biomass and temperature than by species composition. 4. Fluxes of N and P via benthic invertebrate excretion (mumol NH(4)-N or SRP m(-2) day(-1)) were greatest at the oxic sites, where fluxes were dominated by the excretion of tubificids and chironomids. The N and P fluxes at the anoxic site were much lower, and were dominated by excretion by Chaoborus . The ratio of N and P excreted by the benthic invertebrate assemblage varied seasonally and was lowest at the anoxic site. 5. Comparison with other measured inputs shows that excretion by benthic invertebrates could be an important source of nutrients, especially of P. However, the relative importance of nutrient excretion by the benthos varies greatly spatially and temporally.																			0046-5070					JUN	2002	47	6					1107	1121		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00843.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00843.x													WOS:000175729900005

The relative abundance of adult lone star ticks was highest on white-tailed deer, but this stage was also collected from raccoons, opossum, red fox, coyotes, and wild turkey. Nymphs wire collected from gray squirrels, eastern cottontail rabbits, opossums, red fox, Carolina wren, and bobwhite quail, but the highest relative abundance occurred on wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and raccoons. Eastern cottontail rabbits, white-tailed deer, raccoons, and squirrels had the highest relative abundance of larval lone star ticks, but they were also found on opossums and wild turkey.

Bulk organic geochemistry (Rock-Eval pyrolysis, C/N determination, delta(13)C and delta(15)N measurement) and petrography combined with sedimentological evidence and radiocarbon dates allowed to identify four major intervals documenting major environmental changes that occurred during the last 20,000 years. The first interval, dating back to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), contains well-preserved OM derived from higher plants. This material was most probably produced in an ephemeral palustrine system and rapidly buried by sands. This level is thought to have been deposited under relatively and climate conditions associated with strong but episodic rainfalls. Between 19,240 and 17,250 Cal years BP, the climate appears to have been more humid and seasonality more pronounced as suggested by the presence of a permanent lake. After a drastic environmental change dating back to 17,250 Cal years BP, the sediment became truly lacustrine with restricted mineral input and highly degraded higher plant-derived organic matter. After that, a stepwise improvement in the preservation of OM occurred, as revealed by several pronounced shifts in the Rock-Eval TpS2 signal. These changes could document abrupt climatically driven changes during the Late Glacial. Finally, around 5610 Cal years BP, environmental conditions, approaching those prevailing today were established. Minor climatic changes during the Holocene were probably buffered by a high water table which might explain the lack of paleoenvironmental fluctuations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A window into mid-latitudinal Early Eocene environmental variability: a high-resolution palynological analysis of the Falkland site, Okanagan Highlands, British Columbia, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												A series of Eocene lake shale deposits from British Columbia, coined the Okanagan Highlands, are dated from associated volcanic ash as mostly from the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), the longest persisting of the early Paleogene hyperthermals. In this report we focus on high-resolution palynological sampling of short sequences for the Falkland site to determine if they record centennial-or millennial-scale vegetation change during the EECO. The Falkland shales consist of alternating dark-and light-coloured irregular laminae, along with interleaved tephras from volcanic eruptions. At this site it is apparent that deposition occurred over several millennia. Pollen grains were counted under light microscopy using a standard transect method, with clustering analysis determining whether the data show any long-term trends in plant representation and abundance. Our data show that regional vegetation was impacted by millennial- to centennial-scale climatic variability, as well as the effects of volcanic eruptions. At Falkland there appears to be alterations in vegetation assemblages (birch - golden larch association to fir-spruce) that reflect longer-term (centennial to millennial) climatic transitions (warm/wet to cool/dry). Within this sequence, a period of environmental disturbance (reflected in the presence of multiple volcanic ash layers, wave ripple marks, and a fish-kill layer) has a marked impact on vegetation representation, with a dramatic increase in Abies and Picea pollen at the expense of Alnus and Betula, which do eventually recover. These results suggest mid-latitude millennial-scale climate oscillations in the waning period of the EECO of a similar magnitude to Holocene variability.					; Moss, Patrick/AFM-9408-2022; Greenwood, David/C-2758-2008	Moss, Patrick/0000-0003-1546-9242; Greenwood, David/0000-0002-8569-9695													0008-4077	1480-3313				JUN	2016	53	6					605	613		10.1139/cjes-2015-0167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2015-0167													WOS:000378780300006

This study was aimed at the assessment of habitat status of 161 floodplain lakes adjacent to the Biebrza River in NE Poland in relation to flood frequency within the period 1966-2013, based on remote sensing data from the IKONOS satellite. The parameters of floodplain lakes such as morphometry, hydrological connectivity, water transparency and degree of vegetation cover were selected as the most important descriptors of trophic conditions of floodplain lakes. The results were analysed in relation to the daily flood extent and water depth obtained from 1D hydrodynamic model. The layer of digitalized oxbow lakes and mean flood frequency map were overlaid in ArcGIS 10.1. The results showed that habitat conditions of oxbow lakes are strongly correlated with inundation frequency and hydrological connectivity with the river channel. The lakes properties were ordinated using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The ordination showed a strong adverse relationship appeared between the degree of aquatic vegetation cover and water transparency. The inference drawn from our study indicates that both inundation frequency and lateral connectivity of lakes with the Biebrza River channel are the main factors determining the floodplain lakes development. The use of satellite remote sensing appeared as a cost-effective way to obtain generalized information needed for aquatic ecosystems assessments.

Untargeted Metabolomics Analyses and Contaminant Chemistry of Dreissenid Mussels at the Maumee River Area of Concern in the Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Bivalves serve as an ideal ecological indicator; hence, their use by the NOAA Mussel Watch Program to monitor environmental health. This study aimed to expand the baseline knowledge of using metabolic end points in environmental monitoring by investigating the dreissenid mussel metabolome in the field. Dreissenids were caged at four locations along the Maumee River for 30 days. The mussel metabolome was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mussel tissue chemical contaminants were analyzed using gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. All Maumee River sites had a distinct mussel metabolome compared to the reference site and revealed changes in the energy metabolism and amino acids. Data also highlighted the importance of considering seasonality or handling effects on the metabolome at the time of sampling. The furthest upstream site presented a specific mussel tissue chemical signature of pesticides (atrazine and metolachlor), while a downstream site, located at Toledo's wastewater treatment plant, was characterized by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic contaminants. Further research into the dreissenid mussel's natural metabolic cycle and metabolic response to specific anthropogenic stressors is necessary before successful implementation of metabolomics in a biomonitoring program.					; Casu, Fabio/AHD-0531-2022	Bayless, Amanda/0000-0002-9073-5582; Casu, Fabio/0000-0003-2378-375X													0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 22	2023	57	48					19169	19179		10.1021/acs.est.3c00812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00812								38053340					WOS:001114445100001

Testing models of aquatic N2O flux for inland waters	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method for tabulating agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions suggests that aquatic ecosystems may be important N2O sources. However, estimates are highly uncertain, and the method to estimate emissions is rarely tested. The default IPCC emission factor for groundwater and surface drainage (EF5-g; defined as N2O-N: nitrate-N) has been lowered recently. Our data support further reduction. Notably, we present the first EF5-g data under ice, which reflects groundwater inputs not confounded by gas exchange. These under-ice data suggest an EF5-g of 0.13%, approximately half the current IPCC default value. Our data from the open-water season also suggest a reduction to 0.11% (based on annual means). The data highlight major problems with the IPCC method. EF5-g was extremely variable, with the highest values observed in a stream that was a net sink of N2O. Testing the overall method for freshwater emissions is more problematic because of the multidecade transit time from headwaters in our study region to the Atlantic Ocean and limited information on emissions from lakes.

Calibrated sonars with several frequencies allow some information about species composition and abundance to be deduced from acoustic backscatter data. The same instrument can be configured to look up from the bottom, down from the surface or horizontally from a CTD cage. In this presentation we describe an improved low power, battery-operated multi-frequency sonar capable of autonomously collecting data at high temporal and spatial resolution for periods of up to a year. The AZFP instrument (Acoustic Zooplankton and Fish Profiler) supports up to four frequencies in a single housing. The available operating frequencies are 38, 125, 200, 455 and 770 kHz. The transducers are co-located, with the same nominal beam widths of 7 degrees or 8 degrees, except at 38 kHz, where the beam width is 12 degrees. The standard AZFP can be moored at depths up to 300m, and with modified transducers as deep as 600m. The recent improvements to the instrument include replacement of the signal detector with a wide dynamic range logarithmic receiver. The linearity of the receiver response has been improved, its instantaneous dynamic range has been increased to over 80 dB, and the requirement to pre-select one of four time-varying gain settings is no longer necessary, as the expanded dynamic range eliminated the need for a time-varying gain function. Additional noise reduction methods have also been implemented. The procedures used to calibrate acoustic performance of these instruments will be discussed. Typical minimum detectable volume backscatter strengths are -100dB at 20m range to -80dB at 100m range for the 125 and 200 kHz channels, and -80dB at 20m range for the 770 kHz channel. Sixteen GigaBytes (GB) of data storage is provided using a compact flash disk, which allows high temporal sampling rates (maximum 1 Hz) to be performed for shorter deployments. For longer periods, true arithmetic averaging can be done internally in both range and time to reduce the data storage space required. Low power consumption allows the instrument to collect data on four channels out to 100m range, pinging at 0.5 Hz for 150 days on a standard 200 Ampere-hours (A-Hr) battery pack. To illustrate the potential of such observations, preliminary results from several deployments in Saanich Inlet, BC are discussed. The effects of seasonal and year-to-year variations in this area are shown in a segment of a six-year time series collected by a 200 kHz sonar mounted on the VENUS cabled observatory, with the data organized as depth-time 'cubes' to facilitate handling of such long time series. Data from recent nearby deployments of multiple-frequency instruments (125, 200, 455 and 770 kHz) shows examples of the additional information that can be obtained from simultaneous measurements at several frequencies.

Non-carcinogenic health risks of heavy metal in mudfish from Laguna Lake	SCIENCE DILIMAN												This paper examines the potential risks to human health associated with exposure to heavy metal that have bioaccumulated in Mudfish (Ophicephalus striatus) from Laguna Lake. Fish samples were collected in eight sampling stations in three major areas of the lake during the dry and wet seasons. Dry season samples were collected from May to June 2010 and wet season samples, from September to November 2010. Coordinates of sampling site locations were recorded using Global Positioning System (GPS) and plotted in Geographic Information System (GIS) digital maps. Heavy metal analyses for cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr) were conducted using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and a Mercury Analyzer (Mercur-Duo). Estimates of health risks associated with mudfish consumption were summarized according to non-carcinogenic effects. Non-carcinogenic Hazard Quotient (NHQ) values of five heavy metal showed that lead is the most urgent pollutant of concern in terms of adverse health effects from risks associated with mudfish consumption from all sampling locations in the lake. From the point of view of human health protection and disease prevention, mudfish from Laguna Lake is not fit for long-term human consumption primarily due to lead and mercury contamination.																			0115-7809						2012	24	1					23	32																WOS:000217858900004

Response of phytoplankton functional groups to fluctuating water level in two shallow floodplain lakes in Cross River, Nigeria	INLAND WATERS												The response of the phytoplankton community to water level fluctuation in Cross River floodplain lakes in West Africa was studied to identify structuring forces and to compare the response to other tropical regions. Samples were collected monthly from pelagic and littoral zones in the lakes for 18 months (March 2005-August 2006) for water quality variables and phytoplankton analysis. The results showed that temperature (25.6-37.6 degrees C), water level (0.6-5.5 m), dissolved oxygen (0.5-8.7 mg L-1), and conductivity (11-45 mu S cm(-1)) varied significantly (p < 0.05) between low water period (LWP) and high water period (HWP), while changes in transparency (0.1-2.9 m), nitrate (NO3-N; 0.03-5.9 mg L-1), and orthophosphate (PO4-P; 0.04-2.0 mg L-1) were not significant between these 2 hydrologic periods. Species richness (47-96 species), Shannon-Weiner index (6.6-7.5 bit ind.(-1)), and biomass (4.4-17.3 mg L-1) were lower in 2006 HWP compared to 2005. Fourteen functional groups were established, and the sequence of phytoplankton seasonality was summarized as MP -> M/S1 (limnophase -> potamophase; 2005) and MP -> S1 -> Na/D (2006). Hydrologic (vertical and horizontal fluctuations in water level), climatic (temperature), eutrophic (NO3), and biotic (zooplankton grazing) factors were identified as the dominant forces shaping the phytoplankton community.

TREE-RING DATING OF AN ARKANSAS ANTEBELLUM PLANTATION HOUSE	TREE-RING RESEARCH												As part of the Lakeport Plantation Restoration Project conducted by Arkansas State University, we examined tree-ring samples of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum L. Rich.) timbers from the Lakeport Plantation house in Chicot County, Arkansas. Our objectives for the study were to: (1) determine cutting dates of timbers used in the construction of the plantation house and an ancillary log shed in order to support or refute available historical and archaeological evidence for the construction date of the structures, and (2) provide tree-ring data to improve the spatial and temporal tree-ring record for the region. We determined that virtually all the cutting dates for the plantation house were confined to the dormant season of 1858-1859 suggesting that cutting and construction occurred at approximately the same time. We positively dated a total of 25 samples against the exactly-dated master chronology based on living baldcypress trees at Black Swamp, Arkansas, and compiled a 346-year chronology extending from 1537 to 1883. These findings provide absolute quantitative evidence of the age and construction history of one of the most important antebellum buildings in Arkansas and additional background on the material culture of the "cotton aristocracy".

The food associated-effects of these factors for zooplankton growth were tested in field-laboratory experiments with the aim of separating the effects of food quantity from those of food quality at low food conditions, where there is good evidence to support the existence of food quality effects. Manipulation of nutrients generated a large food quantity gradient that exerted the strongest effect on zooplankton growth, with no significant role of UVR. Growth curves were fitted to a saturation function that reached a plateau at increasing seston levels of ca. 250, 500, and 1000 mu g C L-1 for the rotifer Keratella cochlearis, the copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus, and the cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria, respectively, and after which growth decreased in M. laciniatus. Nutrients and to a lesser extent UVR also affected seston quality, which had a minor effect on zooplankton growth. K. cochlearis growth was strongly related to the P content of seston, whereas M. laciniatus and D. pulicaria growth were positively correlated with a P-normalized omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acid index (omega 3-PUFA:P). The increase in seston associated with more intense and frequent atmospheric depositions would adversely affect copepods, but improve growth of C-limited cladocerans and P-limited rotifers in pristine ecosystems of the Mediterranean region.

Determinants of Seasonal Changes in Streamwater Chemistry in Small Catchments with Different Land Use: Case Study from Poland's Carpathian Foothills	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Our paper aims at identifying factors that determine seasonal changes in streamwater chemistry in three catchments with different land use (woodland, agricultural, mixed-use) in the Carpathian Foothills in southern Poland. The study involved weekly and biweekly water sampling in the 2003 and 2004 hydrological years and the analysis of specific conductivity (SC), pH, main ions, and nutrients. R-mode factor analysis was used to identify four factors: (i) streamflow, (ii) climate seasonality, (iii) water circulation, and (iv) nitrification processes. Despite the fact that the same environmental factors were identified in all three catchments, some factors produce a different type of ion response in different types of catchments. The streamflow factor produces the same changes in geologically controlled parameters (SC, main ions) in all catchments but different changes in nutrient concentrations in the woodland and agricultural catchments. In the woodland catchment, nutrients come primarily from diffuse sources (soil flushing), while in the agricultural catchment, nutrients come primarily from point sources (sewage) as result of unregulated wastewater management. The climate factor primarily controls the concentrations of nutrients. High temperatures during the vegetation season usually correlate with increases in nutrient concentrations, especially that of PO43-. This atypical phenomenon is seldom reported in the literature, especially in relation to woodland catchments. The third factor is associated with water circulation in the catchment under different hydrological conditions - during flood events and during low-flow periods. The fourth factor is most likely associated with nitrification processes.

First, we analyzed its general spatio-temporal distribution using its mean, standard deviation and linear trend. Then, we used the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) method to decompose the NDVI and precipitation data into spatial and temporal modes. We selected four leading modes based on North and Scree test rules and analyzed the synchronous seasonal and inter-annual variability between the vegetation index and precipitation, distinguishing time-lagged correlations between EOF modes with the correlative degree analysis method. According to our detailed analyses, the vegetation index and precipitation exhibit a prominent correlation in spatial distribution and seasonal variation. At the 90% confidence level, the time lag is around 110 to 140 days, which matches well with the seasonal variation.

J	Hillier, RD; Marriott, SB; Williams, BPJ; Wright, VP				Hillier, Robert D.; Marriott, Susan B.; Williams, Brian P. J.; Wright, V. Paul			Possible climate variability in the Lower Old Red Sandstone Conigar Pit Sandstone Member (early Devonian), South Wales, UK	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Early Devonian Conigar Pit Sandstone Member (CPSM) of the Freshwater West Formation (Lower Old Red Sandstone, Lochkovian age) at Freshwater West in south Wales comprises a heterolithic, predominantly alluvial suite (mudstones, fine to coarse-grained sandstones, conglomerates) with varying depositional architecture. A number of discrete facies associations are observed. The fine-grained, inclined- and non-inclined heterolithic association is dominant within the CPSM. It represents dryland sinuous channelized flow (IHS bedsets) and unconfined flow (non-inclined bedsets) at terminal and intermediate floodouts deposited under semi-arid conditions. Mudstones were deposited in two distinct environments associated with this semi-arid river system. Laminated and burrowed, reddish brown mudstones were deposited in shallow semi-permanent lakes or pools on the floodplain. Massive mudstones were deposited as within-channel muddy braid-bars, with sedimentary structures being lost during subsequent compaction. The mudstones exhibit Vertisol pedogenesis reflecting the seasonal wetting and drying associated with the semi-arid climate. Periods of intense desiccation are indicated by deep desiccation cracks and associated rubbly surfaces. Possible, though unproven tidal conditions influenced a small percentage of the heterolithic channels at Freshwater West. The extent of these channels is uncertain. The coarser-grained multi-storey sandstone association was deposited by low-sinuosity rivers with a fluctuating, but perennial discharge. Associated with these laterally extensive sandbodies was a high water table with surface ponding (wetlands) that enabled the preservation of plant detritus. During high discharge events, flow expanded over the contemporaneous floodplain depositing the sheet sandstone association within splay complexes. The interpretation that perennial discharge may have been triggered by basin-wide climate change challenges the long-held view that the Lower ORS climate was continuously semi-arid in nature. The spatial/temporal extent of this climate change is uncertain, as it is possible that the multi-storey sandbodies were deposited by allogenic rivers draining a distant, possibly uplifted source area. A decrease in the observed frequency and maturity of Vertisol profiles, and a corresponding increase in multi-storey sandbodies upward through the succession may reflect a long-term, episodic pattern of climate change.

The filling stage was a period of rapid and intense transformation, an abrupt transition from a lotic to a lentic environment. This stage lasted 8-80 d, which was relatively short in comparison with reservoirs in temperate zones or other reservoirs in the Amazon basin. Release of nutrients, increases in water transparency, decreases in turbulence, and development of thermal and oxygen stratification were key factors characterizing this transition. Anoxic events were critical during this stage. During the first few days individuals of various fish species occupied the entire reservoir and water column, independent of the habitat they had inhabited in the river, or the type they would eventually inhabit in the new lake. As anoxia progressed, fish moved to the embayments and tributaries including the main river. Species that remained in the reservoir concentrated mainly in shallow, littoral areas and near the mouth of tributaries. The season of the filling stage was extremely relevant to the colonization process. The ecological transformations observed during the filling stage of neotropical reservoirs are likely more accentuated than in temperate reservoirs, because water temperature remains warm around the year. After the original upsurge, no severe changes in abiotic environment were identified, but a gradual colonization by submersed aquatic macrophytes was evident in some reservoirs, and changes in the fish communities were identified in all reservoirs. In one reservoir, diversity of macrophyte communities became higher than in natural environments within its basin. There was a general absence of fish species pre-adapted to colonize the pelagic zones, and species diversity was higher in the littoral zone. Many species that colonized neotropical reservoirs reproduced in lateral tributaries or upstream stretches. In at least one reservoir, reproductive effort by the fish assemblage in the first two years was low and increased thereafter. Migrators and large-bodied fish reached peak abundance shortly after impoundment, but assemblages shifted towards a dominance by sedentary, medium-sized species. As stability was approached after the upsurge period, diets shifted towards more stable, autochthonous resources. In general, detritivores-illiophages showed sharp reductions, whereas herbivores and zooplanktivores increased-. Piscivores increased in some reservoirs but decreased in others; often they became abundant where pre-adapted latustrine species existed within the basin. Anticipated environmental changes such as reservoir age, including nutrient accumulation, siltation, and habitat deterioration, particularly in the littoral zone are expected to cause faster changes in the fish assemblages. The most notable ones include a reduction in the number of top predators, mean size of species, and species richness. Pelagic species are expected to become dominant as benthic organisms decline and littoral habitat deteriorate. Short-lived species with fast growth or reproductive compensation are expected to have survival advantages. in advanced stages of aging, fish communities are anticipated to consist of species typical of murky, shallow water, with low oxygen. These aging effects are long-term, but will become noticeable in littoral areas sooner.

There were higher concentrations of Hg in the surface sediments from the Huai River during the moderate precipitation season (MPS(2)) as compared to the minimal precipitation (MPS ) and high precipitation seasons (HPS), and as compared to core sediments. The Hg values in all sediments were above the background value. The Hg contents in the tributaries were much higher than those in the mainstream. The concentrations of Sigma parabens in the core sediments ranged from 2.45 to 22.2 ng/g while the concentrations of PHBA ranged from 11.3 to 155 ng/g. Methylparaben (MeP) and propylparaben (PrP) were the most commonly detected parabens. Total organic carbon (TOC) and black carbon (BC) played important roles in the distribution of Hg in the surface sediments during the minimal precipitation and high precipitation seasons and affect the distribution of Hg and parabens in core sediments. Sand (>63 mu m) was another factor affecting the distribution of Hg and parabens in core sediments. The concentrations of PHBA and Hg in core sediments were positively correlated. Temporal records of Hg and parabens in core sediments reflected local social changes. Hg content in the surface sediments during the MPS(2) was associated with relatively high ecological risks while parabens in the core sediments were associated with low level risks.

J	Gurrieri, JT; Furniss, G				Gurrieri, JT; Furniss, G			Estimation of groundwater exchange in alpine lakes using non-steady mass-balance methods	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The role of groundwater in regulating the hydrology and chemistry of cirque lakes in the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness, Montana was investigated to assess the potential for adverse impacts from groundwater drainage stresses produced by proposed underground mining. Non-steady water budget and chemical mass-balances for Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-, delta(2)H and delta(18)O in conjunction with the Penman combination method to estimate evaporation were used to estimate groundwater inflow over 2-4 week time intervals during the ice-free seasons of 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. Extreme seasonal fluctuations in solute and isotope content require the use of a non-steady approach. The degree of groundwater inflow differs widely between lakes ranging from negligible to direct communication with the local groundwater system. For lakes with groundwater inflow, a major portion of the solute load is contributed by groundwater compared to other inputs. The solute mass-balance method proved robust, yielding consistent groundwater inflow values for all lakes while success with stable isotopes was more limited. Mining induced disruptions in groundwater exchange could compromise the hydrologic and chemical balance of lakes with important subsurface water balance components. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Despite being protected under Annex I of the European Union (EU) Habitats Directive, the conservation conditions of these lake habitats is considered bad and inadequate respectively. A lack of field data (including physico-chemical, algal, macrophytes and invertebrates) is preventing appropriate conservation condition assessments, and recommendations to maintain / restore favourable conservation condition. This research aims to characterise these lake habitats with water chemistry data from favourable conservation condition sites and determine their natural state, and to consider seasonal and regional variability to evaluate whether two lake habitats exist. Several water chemistry parameters were monitored in 24 waterbodies monthly for 12 months. Lake habitat 3110 were characterised by higher levels of pH, alkalinity, silica and dissolved oxygen, whereas, contrary to previous reports, levels of true colour and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were lower in lake habitat 3160. However, all 24 sites were acidic with low alkalinity and slightly coloured, hence exhibiting dystrophic conditions. Principal Component Analysis highlighted a strong regional influence separating larger, coloured sites from smaller acidic and altitudinal sites. Differences in true colour were due to strong positive relationships between DOM and catchment area confirming their influence on a regional scale. This research highlights an urgent need to gather physico-chemical field data from a wider range of protected lake habitats 3110 and 3160, and from across the EU to discern whether a gradient of dystrophy exists along which both habitats occur. Outcomes of such research would have implications on the reporting and conservation assessment of these lake habitats by Member States and help harmonise monitoring methods and provide more accurate assessment tools for their reporting under the EU Habitats Directive.					; Lally, Heather/AAS-9836-2020; Gray, Emma/JMR-1633-2023	Lally, Heather/0000-0001-6905-6959; Cappelli, Giovanni/0009-0009-1890-9988; Gray, Emma/0000-0003-3074-1945													0075-9511	1873-5851				NOV	2023	103								126123	10.1016/j.limno.2023.126123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2023.126123		NOV 2023											WOS:001149556400001
J	Ridgway, MS				Ridgway, Mark S.			Line transect distance sampling in aerial surveys for double-crested cormorants in coastal regions of Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Line transect distance sampling was employed in aerial surveys of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) along the coasts of Georgian Bay and the North Channel, Lake Huron. A double-observer method was used to estimate detection probability near the transect line (g(0) = 0.724). Detection of cormorants was not consistent but varied based on group size, location (water, land, flying), and season. Probability of detection in the area covered by the survey was often below 0.5. Incorporating both lack of detection on the flight line along with lack of detection over the covered area inherent in distance sampling provided defensible density estimates of free-ranging double-crested cormorants. Most cormorants were detected loafing on shore (land) among the many islands defining this area of the Lake Huron coast. Land detections exceeded the combined detections of birds on the water and flying. Density in 2004 ranged from a peak of 2.30 cormorants per km(2) (95% CI = 1.72-3.03) in late July to 1.21 cormorants per km(2) (95% Cl = 0.78-1.70) in late August in the sampled areas extending from shore to approximately 20 km offshore. Aerial surveys employing distance sampling can be useful tools in monitoring the distribution and abundance of free-ranging double-crested cormorants and other waterbirds in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

J	Westhorpe, DP; Mitrovic, SM; Ryan, D; Kobayashi, T				Westhorpe, Douglas P.; Mitrovic, Simon M.; Ryan, David; Kobayashi, Tsuyoshi			Limitation of lowland riverine bacterioplankton by dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nutrients	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Flow regulation in lowland rivers has reduced the amount of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) entering main channels through less frequent wetting of benches, flood runners and floodplains. The hypothesis tested was that lowland riverine bacterioplankton are DOC limited when flow events are absent and simulating an increase in assimilable DOC similar to that expected during an environmental flow will lead to heterotrophic dominance. Experiments took place in the Namoi River, a highly regulated lowland river in Australia. Specifically, in situ microcosms were used to examine the responses of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton to various additions of DOC as glucose or leaf leachate, with and without additions of inorganic nutrients. The results indicated that ambient DOC availability limited the bacterioplankton for the three seasons over which we conducted the experiments. When DOC was added alone, dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased primarily because of increased bacterial respiration and bacterioplankton growth generally increased relative to controls. Additions of DOC alone led to a pattern of decreased chlorophyll a concentration relative to controls, except for willow leachate. Additions of inorganic nutrients alone increased chlorophyll a concentrations above controls, indicating limitation of phytoplankton. These findings support our hypothesis. Based on the present results, environmental flows should increase the duration of allochthonously driven heterotrophic dominance, thus shifting regulated lowland rivers to more natural (pre-regulation) conditions for greater periods.

We used trammel nets of 3 different inner mesh sizes in the lakes. The nets were revisited at 3-hr intervals from 0600 to 1800 hrs each day. All turtles were released after being marked, measured, and sexed. During the study, 352 individuals were marked including 162 males, 150 females, and 40 immatures. The majority of the turtles (79%) were captured in the dry season when the water level of the river was declining. Mean standard deviation straight-line carapace length was 210 +/- 14 mm (range 163-262 mm) for males and 251 +/- 18 mm (221-303) for females. Most turtles captured were in the intermediate size classes: 200-210 mm for males and 230-270 mm for females. The sex ratio of adults in this population was 1.05 males per female, not significantly different from 1: 1. Only 12 turtles were recaptured, each once: 5 males, 5 females, and 2 immatures. The population showed recruitment and the adults are in equilibrium; however, few turtles were captured in the smallest or largest size classes.

Assessment of the Melt Rate Function in a Temperature Index Snow Model Using Observed Data	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Temperature index snowmelt models often require representation of a snowpack's melt rate. Defining the melt rate as a function of an accumulated number of warming degree-days is achieved in some temperature index models through the antecedent temperature index-melt rate (ATIMR) function, and provides a reasonable method for adjusting the melt rate during the season. Modelers have typically relied on a default ATIMR function developed two decades ago. However, literature concerning the nature of this default function and how it was developed is largely nonexistent. This paper presents results of a comparison between the default ATIMR function and ATIMR functions computed from field data from two headwater stations within the American River watershed upstream of Folsom Lake, California. An error analysis was also performed using the site-specific data. Using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's hydrologic modeling system (HEC-HMS), it was found that modeled results often varied dramatically between the default curve and the computed curves. In one case, modeled results showed significant improvement between the default method and that of the data-derived approach. This finding suggests that conventional use of the default 1991 curve, often employed in practice irrespective of season and/or location, should at the very least be reconsidered.

The long-term changes in their structural characteristics were then analyzed to identify the main influencing factors and several measures for lake restoration were put forward. Thirty six species, belonging to 9 family and 30 genera, were collected, amongst which, the order Cypriniformes accounted for 61.1% of the total species number. In terms of importance value, Cypriniformes was the predominant group, Coilia nasus the dominant species, while Cyprinus carpio and Rhinogobius giurinus were the subdominant taxa. The community types did not differ among stations, but between seasons. There were no significant differences between seasons and among stations in species diversity, but richness differed both spatially and seasonally. Along with the process of eutrophication and the drastic reduction of the area colonized by macrophytes from 1959 to 2009-2010, the fish diversity declined markedly, and species numbers of herbivores and piscivores declined proportionately more than those of invertivores, omnivores, and planktivores. The decline of potamophilus and river-lake migratory fish was more marked than those of sedentary, river-sea migratory, and estuarine fishes. Eutrophication concomitant with sharp reduction of macrophyte area and overfishing may be the main reasons for the decline in fish diversity in Dianshan Lake.					zhang, hongcheng/O-9719-2015	Chen, Liqiao/0000-0003-0138-7828													0254-4059	1993-5005				JUL	2014	32	4					799	809		10.1007/s00343-014-3193-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3193-4													WOS:000339046200008
J	Young, EO; Ross, DS				Young, EO; Ross, DS			Phosphate release from seasonally flooded soils: A laboratory microcosm study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus derived from agricultural practices has been targeted as a leading cause of water quality degradation in Lake Champlain, Mobilization of P from seasonally flooded agricultural soils is a concern. Using 14 soils from a research farm in New York's Champlain Valley, we characterized the available P status, extractable Fe and Al, P sorption capacities, and soluble phosphate release in flooded laboratory microcosms. Quantities of NH4-acetate available P ranged from 3 to 100 mg kg(-1) and fluoride-extractable P from 10 to 211 mg kg(-1). Flooding soils induced significant release of phosphate to the porewater over a 60- to 90-d period in 13 of the 14 soils studied. Porewater phosphate increases ranged from 2.2 to 27.0 times the initial phosphate concentrations. However, floodwater phosphate increases were much lower, with a maximum of 3.6 times the initial concentration. Average porewater phosphate concentrations over the flooding period ranged from 0.046 to 7.0 mg L-1 and average floodwater P from 0.032 to 3.70 mg L-1. Ammonium-acetate P and the degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) were highly correlated with the average porewater and floodwater phosphate concentration. Average ratio of porewater to floodwater phosphate concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 3.3. Five soils that were lower in fluoride-extractable P had increasing porewater phosphate accompanied by increasing porewater Fe2+ and decreasing floodwater phosphate, Results suggest that P solubility and mobility were a function of both the available P status and redox cycling.

An analysis of seasonal taxonomic variability of TA populations and its correlation with the limnological characteristics of the area (temperature, pH, total organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals, etc.) was performed. The predominant genera were Difflugia, Arcella, and Centropyxis. The most significant changes in the TA community occurred between March and July. Arcella genus dominated in March and April; in May, Arcella and Centropyxis genera were present in the same amount; in June, Arcella genus disappeared, and Difflugia genus started to dominate the community. A multivariate redundancy analysis showed statistically significant correlations between the environmental parameters and the composition of the TA community. The results indicate a negative correlation between TA quantities and Ni, Cd, PAH, Mn, As, and Pb. TA were also affected by concentrations of NH (4) (+) , NO (3) (-) , and P, as well as by temperature variations. The observed correlations between the species composition and environmental parameters can be used in paleoecological interpretations of fossil TA communities. Our results also prove the suitability of TA as water quality indicators in urban areas.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Assessing the ecological effectiveness of protected areas is a high priority in conservation biology and requires suitable indicators. Instead of using multiple species, single species can potentially be used as indicators to assess if conservation efforts are effective in maintaining species over time. Here, we assessed the suitability of ostrich (Struthio cainelus massaicus) population densities and trends over time as indicators for the ecological effectiveness of four study areas (two national parks, a pastoral area, and a game-controlled area with manifold human impacts) in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem of northern Tanzania. Based on road transect surveys from 2011 to 2019, we estimated area- and season-specific population densities in a distance sampling framework and estimated temporal changes using generalized linear mixed models. Ostrich population densities and population trends over time were not associated with formal protection status. Ostriches in one national park occurred at highest densities and were constant over time, while densities were low in another national park and apparently declined over time. Ostriches in the pastoral area had the second-highest mean population density, while remaining constant over time. The study area with the highest human impact had lowest ostrich densities and a seemingly declining trend over time. Ostrich densities were positively correlated with time-matched population density estimates of nine out of ten ungulate species in the same study areas, suggesting that ostrich population densities broadly reflect those of large savanna mammals in this ecosystem. However, site-specific ostrich population trends over time were not closely correlated with trends of common large mammal species. Therefore, ostrich population densities appear as suitable management indicators to assess the broad ecological effectiveness of protected areas. However, ostrich population trajectories do not appear suitable as indicator surrogate to monitor trends of mammal populations over time.					; Kiffner, Christian/F-4088-2012	Griffin, Alisha/0000-0002-5034-5168; Kiffner, Christian/0000-0002-7475-9023													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUN	2021	125								107348	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107348		FEB 2021											WOS:000637783900002

Alkaliphilic and alkalitolerant strains were isolated on cellulose-containing alkaline medium spread with dilutions of scrapings taken from the surface of the decaying plant material. Fifty-one strains were grouped by numerical analysis based on physiological tests and BIOLOG sole carbon source utilization data. The strains identified by 16S rDNA sequence comparisons included members of low G+C Gram positives (Marinibacillus marinus, Bacillus cereus, and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum), high G+C Gram positives (Nesterenkonia halobia and Dietzia natronolimnea), alpha-proteobacteria (Pannonibacter phragmitetus), and gamma-proteobacteria (Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and Halomonas venusta). Most of the strains were characterized by aerobic chemoorganotrophic respiratory metabolism and utilized several different carbon sources, although no direct cellulolytic activity was observed. Results of the pH and salt tolerance tests revealed optimuma in most cases at pH 11 and at the presence of 2.5-5% NaCl. These bacteria probably occupy niches in the aerobic, alkaline, water-influenced environments on the decomposing reed surfaces.					; Borsodi, Andrea/H-1148-2017; Kovacs, Gabor/AAF-3542-2020; Tóth, Erika/H-3637-2017	Kovacs, Gabor M./0000-0001-9509-4270; Borsodi, Andrea/0000-0002-3738-7937; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				JUL	2005	50	1					9	18		10.1007/s00248-004-0063-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-004-0063-1								16132425					WOS:000232267300002

However, isolation of the impact of weather is made difficult by the confounding effects of technological improvements in agriculture, which have resulted in significant grain yield increases. The objective of this study was to identify climatological impacts involved with the production of three crops commonly grown in the region-alfalfa (Medicago, sativa L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-without the influence of technology, and trends of relevant agroclimatological variables during the period 1895-1996. The models DAFOSYM, CERES-Maize, and SOYGRO models were used to simulate crop growth, development, and yield of the three crops, respectively. Regionally, low precipitation and moisture stress were chief limitations to simulated crop yields. Simulated maize and soybean yield series were found to increase with time an average of 11.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 4.9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, across the study sites during the study period. These increases were associated,,vith average study period increases in total seasonal precipitation of 0.4 mm yr(-1) and decreased total seasonal potential evapotranspiration of 0.2 mm yr(-1). No consistent trends were found for alfalfa. The simulated yield results support previous research identifying a period of benign climate, which favored crop production in the region from 1954 to 1973, and was preceded and followed by periods of relatively greater yield variability.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				SEP-OCT	2001	93	5					1059	1070		10.2134/agronj2001.9351059x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2001.9351059x													WOS:000170948000016
J	Deng, Y; Ling, ZY; Jiang, WG				Deng, Yue; Ling, Ziyan; Jiang, Weiguo			Urban water bodies in China: Spatial distribution patterns, temporal change characteristics, and relationship with economic development	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Urban water bodies constitute a vital element within the urban ecosystem. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal changes in urban water bodies and their relationship with economic development in China is critical for sustainable development. However, previous studies usually investigated the spatiotemporal changes of urban water bodies at discrete time points and ignored the relationship between urban water bodies and economic development. Here, this study first corrected freely available water body products based on spatiotemporal majority filter, thereby obtaining an improved yearly urban water body dataset. Then, the research adopted Moran's I and Anselin Local Moran's I to explore the spatial distribution patterns of urban water bodies and employed linear regression and segmented linear regression to investigate the temporal abrupt change and long-term trend of urban water bodies. Finally, we used geodetector to evaluate the relative contributions of GDP to the spatial heterogeneity of trends in urban water bodies. The study revealed a significant spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of urban water bodies, particularly notable in the "High-High" cluster within the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas. It was observed that approximately 40 % and 60 % of total cities experienced an abrupt change in permanent and seasonal urban water bodies, respectively. Specifically, the majority of these abrupt changes occurred during 2010-2013. When considering both long-term trends and abrupt changes, permanent urban water bodies in Chinese cities exhibited primarily a steadily increasing trend, while seasonal water bodies in Chinese cities displayed two distinct temporal patterns: a steadily increasing trend and a decreasing trend followed by a subsequent increasing trend. Furthermore, it was noted that GDP exhibited a significantly positive correlation with the temporal changes of permanent urban water bodies from 2000 to 2020 at the national scale while it first showed a significantly negative correlation with the temporal changes of seasonal urban water bodies from 2000 to 2012 and then showed a significantly positive correlation from 2012 to 2020 on a national scale. In conclusion, we found that GDP played a more important role in driving the spatial heterogeneity of trends in urban water bodies during 2012-2020 compared to 2000-2012, with the relative contribution of similar to 32.5 %.

However, no systematic study has assessed the water body changes over the past few decades for Tianjin, not to mention their response to human activities and climate change. Here, based on the water change tracking (WCT) algorithm, we proposed an improved water change tracking (IWCT) algorithm, which could remove built-up shade noise (account for 0.4%similar to 6.0% of the final water area) and correct omitted water pixels (account for 1.1%similar to 5.1% of the final water area) by taking the time-series data into consideration. The seasonal water product of the Global Surface Water Data (GSWD) was used to provide a comparison with the IWCT results. Significant changes in water bodies of the selected area in Tianjin were revealed from the time-series water maps. The permanent water area of Tianjin decreased 282.5 km(2) from 1984 to 2019. Each time after the dried-up period, due to government policies, the land reclamation happened in Tuanbo Birds Nature Reserve (TBNR), and, finally, 12.6 km(2) of the lake has been reclaimed. Meanwhile, 488.6 km(2) of land has been reclaimed from the sea along the coastal zone in the past 16 years at a speed of 28.74 km(2) yr(-1) in the Binhai New Area (BHNA). The method developed in this study could be extended to other sensors which have similar band settings with Landsat; the products acquired in this study could provide fundamental reference for the wetland management in Tianjin.

The aim of this study was to research the effects of water-level changes on periphytic algal assemblages in Poyang Lake. Dynamic shift of periphytic algal biomass were studied from November 2016 to July 2019. Periphytic algal biomass and species composition were analyzed microscopically, and physicochemical conditions were measured. There were significant seasonal variations in the community distribution of periphytic algae. The biomass of the periphyton ranged from 8 to 22,636 mg m-2. Periphytic algal biomass ranged from 30 to 622 mg m-2 with the average of 204 mg m-2 in the LWL phase; periphytic algal biomass ranged from 8 to 21,839 mg m-2, with the average of 3,399 mg m-2 in the IWL phase. It ranged from 166 to 22,636 mg m-2, with the average 4,320 mg m-2 in the HWL phase and from 16 to 3,231 mg m-2 with the average of 585 mg m-2 in the DWL phase. There were temporal variations in periphytic algal community structure in Poyang Lake. Cryptophyceae dominated in algal periphyton from November 2016 to February 2017. Bacillariophyceae dominated from March to July 2017 (increasing water-level phases). Pynephyceae and Euglenophyceae were dominant from August and September (high-water-level phase) in 2017. Bacillariophyceae dominated through 2018 with occasional dominance of Cryptophyceae from January to June and the occasional dominance of Chlorophyceae from July to December. Chlorophyceae dominated from January to July in 2019 with occasional dominance of Bacillariophyceae. The water-level variations led to environmental heterogeneity in Poyang Lake, creating heterogeneous habitats for algal periphyton. Our study revealed the primary importance of water level, water temperature, conductivity, total nitrogen, nitrite and total phosphorus as abiotic local factors structuring the periphytic algal community in Poyang Lake. The water-level changes did not prevent growth of periphytic algae, but it did change the periphytic algal community assemblages. This research provides data on the periphytic algae in Poyang Lake and will be useful for establishing biological indicators of environmental changes and protecting Poyang Lake in the future.					; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019; wang, xiang/IVV-6713-2023	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													1863-9135					FEB	2021	194	4					311	320		10.1127/fal/2020/1349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2020/1349													WOS:000620599700003

Estimating algal concentration in advance saves time for drinking water plants to take measures and helps us to understand causal chains of algal dynamics. This paper explores the possibility of building a short-term algal early warning model with online monitoring systems. In this study, we collected high-frequency data for water quality and weather conditions in shallow and eutrophic Lake Taihu by an in situ multi-sensor system (BIOLIFT) combined with a weather station. Extracted chlorophyll-a from water samples and chlorophyll-a fluorescence differentiated according to different algal classeses verified that chlorophyll-a fluorescence continuously measured by BIOLIFT only represent chlorophyll-a of green algae and diatoms. Stepwise linear regression was used to simulate the chlorophyll-a fluorescence changing rate of green algae and diatoms together (Delta Chl(a-f)%) and phycocyanin fluorescence concentration (blue-green algae) on the water surface layer (CyanoS). The results show that nutrients (total N, NO3-N, NH4-N, total P) were not necessary parameters for short-term algal models. Delta Chl(a-f)% is greatly influenced by the seasons, so seasonal partition of data before modeling is highly recommended. CyanoS(max) and Delta Chl(a-f%) were simulated by only using multi-sensor and meteorological data (R-2 = 0.73; 0.75). All the independent variables (wave, water temperature, relative humidity, depth, cloud cover) used in the model were measured online and predictable. Wave height is the most important independent variable in the shallow lake. This paper offers a new approach to simulate and predict the algal dynamics, which also can be applied in other surface water. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This lake receives wastewater from different origins. Thus, we assessed the level of pollution through the induction of detoxification activities in tissues of barbel, evaluating simultaneously the suitability of this species to be used as a sentinel. Fish were collected between March 2015 and January 2016 at three locations taking into account the pollution sources and accessibility. In liver, EROD and BFCOD showed the highest induction in October specially in the location of the dam that received pollutants. In gills, only EROD, but not BFCOD, activity was detected. Maximal EROD induction was noted in samples from January. Fish cell lines (RTG-2 and PLHC-1) were exposed to sediments extracts collected at Beni Haroun lake and enzyme activities (EROD and BFCOD, respectively) were measured. Sediment extracts did not induce BFCOD activity. The EROD induction observed in RTG-2 cells was in line with the results observed in fish tissues. Our results suggest that the lake is at risk from pollution and that Barbus callensis is a good sentinel species.

J	Huang, CC; Yao, L				Huang, Changchun; Yao, Ling			Semi-Analytical Retrieval of the Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient in Large and Shallow Lakes from GOCI, a High Temporal-Resolution Satellite	REMOTE SENSING												Monitoring the dynamic characteristics of the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(490)) on the basis of the high temporal-resolution satellite data is critical for regulating the ecological environment of lake. By measuring the in-situ K-d(490) and the remote-sensing reflectance, a semi-analytical algorithm for K-d(490) was developed to determine the short-term variation of K-d(490). From 2006 to 2014, the data about 412 samples (among which 60 were used as match-up points, 282 for calibrating dataset and the remaining 70 for validating dataset) were gathered from nine expeditions to calibrate and validate the aforesaid semi-analytical algorithm. The root mean square percentage error (RMSP) and the mean absolute relative error (MAPE) of validation datasets were respectively 27.44% and 22.60 +/- 15.57%, while that of the match-up datasets were respectively 34.29% and 27.57 +/- 20.56%. These percentages indicate that the semi-analytical algorithm and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data are applicable to obtain the short-term variation of K-d(490) in the turbid shallow inland waters. The short-term GOCI-observed K-d(490) shows a significant seasonal and spatial variation and a similar distribution to the matching Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) which derived K-d(490). A comparative analysis on wind (observed by buoys) and GOCI-derived K-d(490) suggests that wind is a primary driving factor of K-d(490) variation, but the lacustrine morphometry affects the wind force that is contributing to K-d(490) variation.

Magnus W.; Donner, Kristian			Increasing the illumination slowly over several weeks protects against light damage in the eyes of the crustacean Mysis relicta	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The eyes of two glacial-relict populations of opossum shrimp Mysis relicta inhabiting the different photic environments of a deep, dark-brown freshwater lake and a variably lit bay of the Baltic Sea differ in their susceptibility to functional depression from strong light exposures. The lake population is much more vulnerable than the sea population. We hypothesized that the difference reflects physiological adaptation mechanisms operating on long time scales rather than genetically fixed differences between the populations. To test this, we studied how acclimation to ultra-slowly increased illumination (on time scales of several weeks to months) affected the resilience of the eyes to bright-light exposures. Light responses of whole eyes were measured by electroretinography, the visual-pigment content of single rhabdoms by microspectrophotometry and the structural integrity of photoreceptor cells by electron microscopy (EM). Slow acclimation mitigated and even abolished the depression of photoresponsiveness caused by strong light exposures, making a dramatic difference especially in the lake animals. Still, acclimation in the sea animals was faster and the EM studies suggested intrinsic differences in the dynamics of microvillar membrane cycling. In conclusion, we report a novel form of physiological adaptation to general light levels, effective on the time scale of seasonal changes. It explains part but not all of the differences in light tolerance between the lake and sea populations.					; Viljanen, Martta/AAG-6894-2019	Nevala, Noora Emilia/0000-0001-5018-3157; Donner, Kristian/0000-0001-7833-4236; Viljanen, Martta/0000-0001-7363-6729													0022-0949	1477-9145				AUG 1	2017	220	15					2798	2808		10.1242/jeb.155101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.155101								28515237					WOS:000407024800022
J	Martin, AJ; Pedersen, TF				Martin, AJ; Pedersen, TF			Seasonal and interannual mobility of arsenic in a lake impacted by metal mining	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Detailed examination of the water column, sediments, and interstitial waters was conducted in Balmer Lake, Ontario, Canada, in 1993-1994 and 1999 in order to assess the seasonal and interannual controls governing the behavior of As. High-resolution profiles of dissolved (<0.45 mum) Fe, Mn, SO42-, and SigmaH(2)S across the sediment-water interface indicate the presence of reducing conditions in close proximity to the benthic boundary during ice-free periods, which are characterized by fully oxygenated bottom waters. Dissolved As is remobilized as As(III) in suboxic sediment horizons via the redox-controlled dissolution of Fe (and perhaps Mn) oxide phases. During 1993-1994, As fluxes to the water column were relatively low (2-15 mug cm(-2) year(-1)) and contributed between 2 and 18% of the water column inventory. Dissolved As in the lake waters was derived primarily from external mining-related loadings during this period. Between 1993 and 1999, external loadings of As to Balmer Lake decreased while [As](aq) within the lake increased, suggesting an increase in the proportion of sediment-derived As. Indeed, benthic dissolved As fluxes in 1999 ranged from 179 to 380 mug cm(-2) year(-1), representing similar to33-60% of the water column burden. The relatively recent importance of sedimentary arsenic sources is suggested to reflect changes to sediment redox conditions associated with a postulated increase in lake primary productivity. Ironically, the increased contribution of dissolved arsenic to the water column appears to have resulted from an otherwise improvement in water quality. Reduced loadings of Cu, Zn, and Ni to the lake since 1994 appear to have allowed increased phytoplankton production that has stimulated arsenic release.																			0013-936X					APR 1	2002	36	7					1516	1523		10.1021/es0108537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0108537								11999060					WOS:000174789200036
J	Sarà, G				Sara, Gianluca			VARIATION OF SUSPENDED AND SEDIMENTARY ORGANIC MATTER WITH DEPTH IN SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS	WETLANDS												I tested the hypothesis that the quantity and quality of suspended and sediment organic matter in shallow coastal waters is affected by wind-induced resuspension at a smaller depth scale (< 1 m) than usually assumed. Water and sediment surface (0 to 1 cm) samples were collected on a seasonal basis and analyzed for total suspended matter, organic fraction, and phytopigments at 12 shallow sites representing a depth gradient from 0.2 to 2.0 m along the western shore of Sicily. Water column concentrations of all measured variables decreased rapidly with increasing water column depth, and concentrations levelled off at about 1 m water column depth. The likelihood of sediment resuspension by wind for various combinations of water column depth and fetch length was modelled using the CERC (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Coastal Engineering Centre, Washington D.C. US) model for 10 years of local wind data. The simulations indicated that even light winds (2 m s(-1)) increased the likelihood of resuspension in the shallowest basin (0.2 m depth) with an effective fetch of 250 m. This study provides evidence that shallow water systems should not be investigated by considering the entire water column as a single homogenous layer. Investigations of shallow water ecosystems should consider 2 main layers with different ecological conditions and functions: a shallow surface turbulent layer From the surface to a depth of 1 m that is strongly affected by wind-driven physical forces and a deeper, below 1 m to the sediment surface, layer where wind-driven turbulence has less impact.

The development of effective assessment tools based on littoral macroinvertebrates is currently limited by the lack of knowledge as to whether effects of lakeshore modification on macroinvertebrate communities are mediated by water depth and season. We quantified the macroinvertebrate community of a large lowland lake (Lake Scharmiitzelsee, Germany) at natural shores and shores modified by marinas and beaches in three depth zones between April and November 2011. The effect of lakeshore modification on macroinvertebrate diversity and community composition was most pronounced in the upper littoral and less important in the middle littoral and profundal zone. Conversely, seasonal effects on upper littoral macroinvertebrate diversity and composition were less important than shore type in comparison with the middle littoral and profundal zone. We recommend that future assessment methods based on macroinvertebrates should focus on the upper littoral zone, where effects of lakeshore modifications are strongest and communities are most susceptible to anthropogenic impairments. Our results also suggest that a single seasonal sampling is sufficient to capture the compositional differences of macroinvertebrate communities associated with human lakeshore modifications.

J	Mao, XF; Yang, ZF				Mao, Xufeng; Yang, Zhifeng			Functional assessment of interconnected aquatic ecosystems in the Baiyangdian Basin-An ecological-network-analysis based approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Many individual aquatic ecosystems are hydraulically interconnected and form specific network structures that display integral characteristics. The functional assessment of individual aquatic ecosystems is important, yet inadequate, for developing effective protection and restoration policies in basins, in which multiple interconnected aquatic ecosystems are involved. Here, we developed a framework to use ecological network analysis for functional assessment of a large system composed of various aquatic ecosystems in the context of network-based management. Five storage factor-included network indices were used to characterize the system functioning that was defined here as a performance with a certain of system activities and organization. A deviation index (D), combining normalized input, internal and output ascendency, was used to analyze the degree and causes of system functional variation. China's Baiyangdian Lake, a typical aquatic ecosystem, was taken as a case study. The results demonstrated that these storage factor-included network indices could well depict the system attributes and provide integral functional assessment of the aquatic ecosystems network in the Baiyangdian Basin. The functions of the aquatic ecosystems network presented distinct seasonal fluctuations, and there was a continuous decline in system functioning over the period of 1959-1978. Both natural and human causes contributed to the functional degradation, while the latter one dominated the degradation. Current study provided an example of how the network analysis might improve the understanding of the integral functioning of interconnected aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Earlier model versions have been presented before, and the focus here is on the novelties. Several parts and processes in the model have been altered and the results of these changes are described and evaluated. Changes that provided significant differences and improved predictions have been adopted. These changes include addition of two compartments for colloidal phosphorus, a seasonal moderator for the lake outflow, higher settling velocity for resuspended material, new algorithms for mixing between deep water and surface water and for phosphor-us diffusion from areas of sediment accumulation. Algorithms to calculate the water content and organic content of accumulation sediments and a sub-model for suspended particulate matter (SPM) are also introduced. The model predictions are in good agreement with empirical data from several lakes in a wide limnological domain. The main results presented in this paper are: (1) Various model equations, constants and structures have been critically tested and evaluated. (2) Based on these critical model tests, the model has been improved without additional driving variables. The complete description of the new model is given in Appendix A. The novelties include a seasonal moderator for the lake outflow, inclusion of phosphorus bound in phytoplankton in the fluxes from the lake, new algorithms for mixing and diffusion, introduction of two compartments for colloidal phosphorus, algorithms for water content and organic content in A-sediments and a sub-model for SPM. (3) The new model has been validated, showing good agreement against empirical data from different types of lakes. The new model should be considered as a useful tool for lake management as well as for explanatory purposes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the hydrochemical characteristics of riparian wetlands at the Middle Ebro River (NE Spain)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					9th International Conference on Copepoda	JUL 11-15, 2005	Hammamet, TUNISIA					In natural systems, the chemistry of floodplain waters is a function of the source of the water, which is influenced by geomorphic features of riparian wetlands. However, anthropogenic disturbances may alter both geomorphic features and the natural balance of water mixing in the floodplain. The aim of this study was to classify riparian wetlands and characterize their water characteristics in one reach of the Middle Ebro River to assess the hydrochemical functioning of the system. In order to accomplish that goal, water samples were collected at 40 sampling sites during low-water conditions and two floods of different magnitude. Moreover, geomorphic characteristics of riparian wetlands were also analyzed to interpret the results at broader spatio-temporal scales. Three group of wetlands were identified using multivariate ordination: (1) major and secondary channels highly connected to the river by surface water, containing weakly ionized water with high nitrate levels during floods; (2) secondary channels and artificial ponds located in riparian forests near the river, most of which were affected by river seepage during the examined events. This type of sites had high major ions concentrations and elevated spatial variability with respect to nutrient concentrations during floods; (3) Siltated oxbow lakes, whose hydrogeochemical features seemed to be unaffected by factors related to river fluctuations. Total dissolved solids, major ion (sulfate, chloride, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium) and nutrient (nitrate, ammonium and organic nitrogen, and phosphate) depended upon the relationships between surface and subsurface water flows. Seasonal changes and geomorphic characterization indicated that a strong functional dependence of floodplain wetlands close to the main river channel is established, whereas most of the floodplain area remains disconnected from river dynamics. Moreover, the effect of nitrate-enriched agricultural runoff seems to affect water quality and hydrochemical gradients of the system. Based on our results, we propose different types of actions for the management of the Ebro River flow to ensure a more natural ecological functioning of its floodplains.					; Cabezas, Alvaro/G-2730-2016; González Sargas, Eduardo/AAI-3560-2021; Gallardo, Belinda/H-9038-2013	Gonzalez-Sargas, Eduardo/0000-0001-6485-0088; Gallardo, Belinda/0000-0002-1552-8233; Gonzalez-Sanchis, Maria/0000-0002-2227-8404													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2009	617						101	116		10.1007/s10750-008-9531-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9531-9													WOS:000261750800009

The Hydrology of the Nile Basin	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											The hydrology of the Nile is discussed through a description of the various tributaries, ranging from Lake Victoria and its numerous tributaries, through the lower Lakes Kyoga and Albert which contribute inflows to the White Nile in different periods. A major feature of the Lake Plateau is the great increase in outflows between the periods before and after 1961-1964. The lake-fed inflow to the Bahr el Jebel where it enters the Sudd wetland is supplemented by the highly seasonal flow of the torrents, and half the inflow is lost by inundation of the wetlands and subsequent evaporation. The contributions of the Bahr el Ghazal and Sobat tributaries to the White Nile are discussed. The Blue Nile provides the greater part of the flow of the main Nile, but its contribution is more seasonal than that of the White Nile, being the residual of seasonal rainfall on the Ethiopian highlands. The regimes of the Atbara and the main Nile lead to a discussion of the Aswan High Dam and the variability of the tributary flows over the period of records.																			0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						335	364				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800017

In recent history, and especially during 1950s-1970s, extensive lakes and floodplains were reclaimed as polders for agriculture and rural development. Consequently, the flood retention capacity was decreased, many lakes were disconnected from the main channel of the Yangtze by embankments and sluice gates, and eutrophication was common. It is anticipated that there will be a greater frequency of extreme floods and droughts in the basin according to climate change scenarios. WWF commenced a programme in 2002 in partnership with government agencies and local communities to reconnect three lakes (Zhangdu, Hong and Tian-e-zhou) in Hubei Province to the river by opening sluice gates seasonally and improving lake management. The resilience of the lake environment to climate change and the livelihoods of local people were enhanced. The measures assessed here highlight: (a) the need for adaptation programmes to concurrently improve livelihoods and reduce exposure to physical risks; (b) the need to build the capacity of people and institutions; and (c) the value of decentralized adaptation as compared with new infrastructure investments.

This contribution discusses the environmental factors that define the macrophyte community of Lake Bohinj and explains the observed long-term trends in the species present and their abundance and depth distributions from 1996 to 2016. These macrophyte parameters are related to water quality parameters (i.e. total nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, water transparency) and meteorological parameters (i.e. precipitation rate, monthly temperature, hours of solar radiation and frequency of storm events per month). We determined 10 submerged macrophyte species, with the stonewort Chara aspera and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum prevailing. The variability in the chemical parameters of the water in Lake Bohinj over the study period was low, while the regional air temperatures in the peak season were increasing (R-2=0.56). Cumulative macrophyte abundance revealed a decreasing trend in the studied period, while the maximal depth distribution was less affected. Cumulative macrophyte abundance was positively related to total nitrogen (r=0.67) and maximal chlorophyll a concentrations (r=0.59), while negatively to total phosphorus (r=-0.56) and minimal transparency (r=0.63). Redundancy correspondence analysis (RDA) run with the water quality parameters revealed the importance of the maximal chlorophyll a concentrations in the lake water, which explained 54% of variability in the species composition and abundance, followed by total nitrogen that explained additional 10%. Regarding their maximum depth distribution, only 22% of its variability was explained by maximal chlorophyll a concentrations. RDA run with the meteorological data showed the importance of temperature in July in explaining the variability of the species present and their abundance and depth distribution. The study revealed differences in macrophyte community structure during the experimental period, even though during the monitoring period, annual averages of water quality parameters had never exceeded the values, indicating oligotrophic conditions according to the criteria of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This study points out the importance of macrophytes for assessing the ecological status of lakes and a need for detailed survey of direct disturbances into the lake littoral.																			1436-3798	1436-378X				FEB	2019	19	2			SI		339	348		10.1007/s10113-018-1345-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1345-3													WOS:000458271700004
J	Potter, C; Coppernoll-Houston, D				Potter, Christopher; Coppernoll-Houston, Dana			Controls on Land Surface Temperature in Deserts of Southern California Derived from MODIS Satellite Time Series Analysis, 2000 to 2018	CLIMATE												The land surface temperature (LST) in arid regions is a primary controller of many ecological processes. Consequently, we have developed a framework for detection of LST change on a regional scale using data sets covering all deserts of southern California from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor. The Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) methodology was applied to MODIS 1-km monthly LST data from the years 2000 to 2018 to estimate significant time series shifts (breakpoints) and gradual trends. Area-wide results showed five times more positive LST breakpoints (abrupt temperature warming events) than negative (surface cooling) breakpoints. Cross-correlations with high rainfall periods around Mojave dry lake playas, and comparison with timing of wildfire burns for breakpoint patterns, showed that abrupt shifts in LST had the strongest response to these controllers. We detected negative LST (abrupt cooling) breakpoints as consistently associated with the construction of new solar energy facilities. Over the majority of the study area, BFAST results showed warming LST trends between the years 2000 and 2018. The western-most margins of the study area showed consistent widespread warming trends, whereas the eastern portions of the Mojave and Lower Colorado Deserts showed a mix of positive and neutral LST trends. Long-term cooling LST trends were detected only in some of the largest dry lake formations in the Antelope Valley, Death Valley, and Bristol, Cadiz, and Danby playas.																			2225-1154					FEB	2019	7	2							32	10.3390/cli7020032	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7020032													WOS:000460705300015

This small marshy basin (c. 5-7 ha) is located in forest-savanna mosaic in Lope Reserve (0 degrees 43'S, 11 degrees 46'E), central Gabon. The Kamalete pollen data show the persistence over the past 1300 years of a relatively stable forest-savanna mosaic, associated with significant changes of the forest component. Three successive stages of forest dynamics occurred. First, at 1325 cal. BP, moist semi-evergreen rainforest existed around the catchment of Lake Kamalete. However, it appears from the consistent presence of > 70% Gramineae pollen that the site was always primarily in savanna. Secondly, from c. 1240 to 550 cal BP, a noticeable increase in shade-intolerant plant species indicate openings in the rainforest canopy. The persistence of gap-colonizer species, such as Macaranga, Tetrorchidium and Musanga for several centuries in the rainforest, is explained by recurring canopy disturbance associated with shifts in available moisture. These hydrological changes may be related to a succession of longer and more severe dry seasons than observed today. Thirdly, at 550 cal BP, mature forest was re-established, corresponding to progressive savanna colonization by forest pioneer species such as Aucoumea klaineana, Lophira alata and Fagara macrophylla. This new phase of forest expansion coincided with a marked lithological change, indicating an increase in lake-level. It is concluded that the major vegetation changes observed are due to climatic variability, and anthropogenic action had limited influence.					alexchepstow@gmail.com, Alex/AAV-5258-2021														0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2005	15	7					1021	1031		10.1191/0959683605hl875ra	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl875ra													WOS:000233135300009

Therefore, a dynamic growth model was developed for Typha to examine the effects of latitudinal changes in temperature and radiation on partitioning of the total biomass during the growing season into rhizomes, roots, flowering and vegetative shoots, and inflorescences. Methods After validating the model with data from growth studies of Typha found in past literature, it was used to investigate the dynamics of above- and below- ground biomasses at three latitudes: 30 degrees, 40 degrees and 50 degrees Key Results Regardless of the initial rhizome biomass, both above- and below- ground biomass values converged to a latitude-specific equilibrium produced by the balance between the total production and respiration and mortality losses. Above-ground biomass was high from 10 degrees to 35 degrees latitude with sufficient radiation, despite high metabolic losses; however, it decreased markedly at higher latitudes due to a low photosynthetic rate. Below-ground biomass, on the other hand, increased with latitude up to 40 degrees due to decreasing metabolic losses, and then markedly decreased at higher latitudes. Above- ground biomass was enhanced with an increasing number of cohorts regardless of latitude. However, although more cohorts resulted in a larger below- ground biomass at low latitudes, the largest below-ground biomass was provided by a smaller number of cohorts at high latitudes. This difference is due to low production rates of late-season cohorts in high latitudes, compared with consumption for shooting and establishing foliage. Conclusions The model could be used to predict the potential growth of Typha in given conditions over a wide range of latitudes and is useful for practical applications such as wetland management or wastewater treatment systems using Typha.

Comparison with the WHO guidelines and the estimated water quality indices (DWQI and IWQI) grouped almost all the samples collected after the warm season rainfall in excellent and good categories (DWQI < 100) for drinking, even though fluoride remained > 1.5 mg/L in 50% samples. Except for one groundwater sample, all showed > 25% permeability (classes I and II) in Donnen classification indicating their suitability for irrigation. USSL and Wilcox classifications, however, catalogued some in the high-salinity hazard group and some as doubtful for irrigating regular plants. Samples from about 53% wells were also in high and severe restriction categories of IWQI for the irrigation. Total Hazard Quotient Index (THQI) for estimating the non-carcinogenic risk (HQ(fluoride )> 1) showed that at least one lake water sample and 53% of groundwater might expose the adult and child population to dental and skeletal fluorosis. This water quality assessment data posterior to the rainfall season could be useful as a baseline for both the short- and long-term monitoring in attention to the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 6.					; S, Selvam/U-2719-2018; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018	Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2023	30	54					115430	115447		10.1007/s11356-023-30488-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-30488-7		OCT 2023						37884711					WOS:001090776200019

Nyiragongo	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Mt. Nyiragongo is an active volcano located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to the border of Rwanda and about 15 km north of the city of Goma (similar to 1,000,000 inhabitants). Gases emitted from Nyiragongo might pose a persistent hazard to local inhabitants and the environment. While both ground- and satellite-based observations of the emissions exist, prior to this study, no detailed analysis of the dispersion of the emissions have been made. We have conducted a dispersion study, using a modelling system to determine the geographical distribution of SO2. A combination of a meteorological model (WRF), a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (FLEXPART-WRF) and flux data based on DOAS measurements from the NOVAC-network is used. Since observations can only be made during the day, we use random sampling of fluxes and ensemble modelling to estimate night-time emissions. Seasonal variations in the dispersion follows the migration of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone. In June-August, the area with the highest surface concentrations is located to the northwest, and in December-February, to the southwest of the source. Diurnal variations in surface concentrations were determined by the development of the planetary boundary layer and the lake-/land breeze cycle around lake Kivu. Both processes contribute to low surface concentrations during the day and high concentrations during the night. However, the strong northerly trade winds in November-March weakened the lake breeze, contributing to higher daytime surface concentrations along the northern shore of Lake Kivu, including the city of Goma. For further analysis and measurements, it is important to include both seasonal and diurnal cycles in order to safely cover periods of high and potentially hazardous concentrations.

This study analysed C. crystallinus population dynamics and its influence on the zooplankton community structure in ponds by means of different methods of multivariate statistics based on data collected from 19 mesocosm studies over a period of 14 years. Usually, there were three Chaoborus generations per year in the evaluated studies. According to redundancy analysis the population structure of C. crystallinus varied significantly between years and seasons (within a year). Ordination analysis indicated that C. crystallinus had a significant long-term impact on the zooplankton community structure but this impact was weak when compared to time-related factors. The fourth larval stage had the greatest influence on the zooplankton community. C. crystallinus promoted high densities of rotifers and reduced the abundance of small crustaceans (copepods and small cladocerans). The abundance of large cladocerans such as daphnids was unaffected by the number of C. crystallinus larvae. There was no indication that the predatory impact of C. crystallinus on zooplankton substantially influenced phytoplankton. This study provides new findings to a better understanding of impacts on the pelagic food web related to Chaoborus predation.

Typhoons rapidly load substantial amounts of terrestrial C into smaller subtropical lakes (i.e., Yuan-Yang Lake in Taiwan, hereafter referred to as YYL), renewing and mixing the water column. We developed a conceptual dissolved C model and hypothesized that allochthonous C loading and river inflow intrusion may affect the dissolved inorganic C (DIC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) distributions in a small subtropical lake under these extreme climates. A two-layer conceptual C model was developed to explore how the DIC and DOC fluxes respond to typhoon disturbances on seasonal and interannual timescales in YYL while simultaneously considering autochthonous processes such as algal photosynthesis, remineralization, and vertical transformation. To compare the temporal patterns of fluxes between typhoon years (2015-2016) and non-typhoon years (2017-2018), monthly field samples were obtained and their DIC, DOC, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations measured. The results demonstrated that net ecosystem production was 3.14 times higher in typhoon years than in non-typhoon years. These results suggested that a loading of allochthonous C was the most crucial driver of the temporal variation in C fluxes in typhoon years because of changes in physical and biochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, mineralization, and vertical transportation. However, the lowered vertical transportation rate shaped the seasonal C in non-typhoon years due to thermal stratification within this small subtropical lake.

In recent years, there has been a perception that water quality has deteriorated in northern regions of the lake, with all increase in the frequency and intensity of toxin-producing cyanobacterial blooms. However, given the lack of long-term data these trends are difficult to verify. As a first step, we examine spatial and seasonal patterns in water quality in this highly complex lake on the Canadian Shield. Further, we examine surface sediment diatom assemblages across multiple sites to determine if they track within-take differences in environmental conditions. Our results show that there are significant spatial patterns in water quality in LOW. Principal Component Analysis divides the lake into three geographic zones based primarily on algal nutrients (i.e., total phosphorus, TP), with the highest concentrations at sites proximal to Rainy River. This variation is closely tracked by sedimentary diatom assemblages, with [TP] explaining 43% of the variation in diatom assemblages across sites. The close correlation between water quality and the surface sediment diatom record indicate that paleoecological models could be used to provide data on the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic sources of nutrients to the lake.					; Pla-Rabes, Sergi/J-9209-2012; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Pla-Rabes, Sergi/0000-0003-3532-9466; 													0380-1330						2005	31	3					253	266		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70257-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70257-4													WOS:000232425200002
J	Kwan, KHM; Chan, HM; de Lafontaine, Y				Kwan, KHM; Chan, HM; de Lafontaine, Y			Metal contamination in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) along the St. Lawrence River	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In order to evaluate the use of zebra mussels as biomonitors for metal bioavailability in the St. Lawrence River, we tested the hypothesis that the concentrations of 11 metals in zebra mussels vary significantly between sites along the river and that the season of collection and body size affect metal bioaccumulation. Mussels were collected at 14 sites during June 1996 and at monthly intervals at one site. Specimens were grouped in three size classes and their soft tissue was analyzed for As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn. Significant size effects were found for Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. Spatial and seasonal variations in bioconcentration were significant for all metals. Spatial patterns in contamination that corresponded to known point sources of pollution or hydrology of the river were identified by principal component analysis. Seasonal variations can be attributed to the reproductive cycle of mussels and hydrological variability of the river. In comparison with values reported for zebra mussels in other contaminated sites in North America and Europe, levels of metal in the St. Lawrence River are low or intermediate. Our results show that when controlled for size and seasonal effects, zebra mussels represent a useful biomonitor for metal availability in the river and may offer an interesting alternative to native mussels and fish for such a role. Local contamination by some toxic metals is still a cause for concern in the St. Lawrence River.

In this research, we aimed to document the association between contaminations of water samples with human enteric viruses (adenoviruses and enteroviruses) from a freshwater lake with variations in chemical contaminants. We collected 216 water samples from October 2010 to April 2012, from a 4 km stretch along Lake Victoria (LV) basin in Homa Bay town located in the western region of Kenya. The samples were analyzed for the existence of human adenoviruses (HAdV) and human enteroviruses (HEV), using the nested PCR (nPCR). We also assessed in the water samples the levels of twelve chemical contaminants consisting of six heavy metal elements and six anions. About 8.3 % of the samples were found to be contaminated with the enteric viruses. The concentrations of the 12 chemical contaminants were found to be largely within the WHO suggested limits. Most of the chemical contaminants were not related to the detection rates of the viruses from the statistical analysis. However, some positive and negative associations between the viral genome's detection and the chemical concentrations were established for only three metals (Fe, Pb, Cd) and the PO4(3-) Radical. Cd had a weak positive significant relationship with HAdV (rho = 0.146, p = 0.032) while Pb and Fe had a weak positive significant relationship with HEV genome detection (rho = 0.156, p = 0.022) and (rho = 0.148 and p = 0.029) respectively. There was a modest negative relationship between phosphate ions and HEV (rho = -0.174, p = 0.010). The results of our study do not provide support for the hypothesis of an association between the presence of human enteric viruses and the levels of twelve chemical contaminants.					; Opere, Michael/AAZ-4304-2020; Opere, Michael/ISU-6219-2023; Maingi, John/AAK-3490-2020	ombori, omwoyo/0000-0001-5353-467X; Opere, Michael/0000-0002-2351-2282; 														2296-2565				JAN 20	2021	8								603217	10.3389/fpubh.2020.603217	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.603217								33553093					WOS:000614082600001

Change in Piscivore Growth Potential after the Introduction of a Nonnative Prey Fish: a Bioenergetics Analysis	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The introduction of additional forage fish species to enhance sport fisheries is a common management strategy in lakes and reservoirs. However, illegal introductions occur without consideration of all potential ecological consequences. Introduction of Blueback Herring Alosa aestivalis as a forage fish to enhance recreational fisheries has been controversial, with several illegal introductions documented in the southeastern United States. We quantified the caloric density of introduced Blueback Herring and native Threadfin Shad Dorosoma petenense in Lewis Smith Lake, Alabama, to determine their potential values as prey to piscivorous fish. Caloric density estimates were then incorporated into bioenergetics simulations for Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Alabama Bass Micropterus henshalli, and Striped Bass Morone saxatilis to estimate their growth potential given different diet compositions. Piscivore diet composition from before the introduction of Blueback Herring was also incorporated into bioenergetics simulations for comparison with post-introduction scenarios. Caloric density of Blueback Herring was higher than that of Threadfin Shad across all seasons, and consequently, bioenergetics simulations predicted increased growth potential for Largemouth Bass, Alabama Bass, and Striped Bass with increased proportions of Blueback Herring in their diets. The simulated growth effect of shifting consumption from Threadfin Shad to Blueback Herring was smaller for Largemouth Bass versus Striped Bass because Striped Bass were far more piscivorous than Largemouth Bass, with Alabama Bass intermediate. Simulated pre-Blueback Herring piscivore diets resulted in less growth relative to what was observed for all post-introduction simulations. Although Blueback Herring had higher caloric density values than Threadfin Shad, overall ecological impacts of their introduction are not yet fully understood and could likely also include negative impacts on these piscivores. As such, our findings represent one aspect of the overall, potentially complex effect of introduced Blueback Herring as an additional forage fish for piscivores.

All were inhabited by yellow perch (Perca flavescens), which was sometimes the only species present. Liver Cd and Cu concentrations were monitored in these lakes, in some cases for several consecutive years and for multiple seasons, This data suggests that yellow perch from clean to mildly-contaminated environments loosely control their hepatic Cu concentrations between 7 and 50 mug g dry weight(-1), and a threshold of 50 mug g dry weight(-1) is suggested as the normal range of homeostatic control. Similar data collected by others support this value. Liver Cd concentrations appeared more variable among lake samples, but consistently remained below 10 mug g dry weight(-1) in clean to mildly-contaminated lakes, also supported by data collected elsewhere. Condition factors allowed the discrimination between clean and polluted yellow perch, a conclusion consistent with data for the same species collected in the Rouyn-Noranda area (Quebec. Canada). Values of weight-to-length scaling coefficient lower than 3.0 also discriminated between clean and metal-polluted yellow perch. Finally, three studies indicated that chronic metal exposure can lead to an impairment of aerobic capacities in wild yellow Perch, as indicated by lower muscle activity of citrate synthase (CS), aerobic swim performance and respiration rate. We propose that the combination of liver metal concentrations, scaling coefficient. condition factor and an indicator of physiological impairment such as muscle CS activity can provide a suitable range of parameters to adequately assess the effects of metal contamination on the health of yellow Perch. Although yellow perch are ubiquitous in North America, this approach can potentially be applied to other small fish species more suitable to other study areas.

Philopatry and vagrancy of white bass (Morone chrysops) spawning in the Sandusky River: Evidence of metapopulation structure in western Lake Erie using otolith chemistry	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Although natal homing and philopatry are well studied. in anadromous salmon, few studies have investigated philopatric behavior in large, freshwater systems. In western Lake Erie, white bass (Morone chrysops) undergo seasonal spawning migrations from the open-water regions of Lake Erie to nearshore reef complexes and tributaries. The three primary spawning locations in Lake Erie are within 80 km of each other and are not separated by physical barriers. We used naturally occurring differences in otolith strontium concentrations among major spawning locations to address philopatry and vagrancy to the Sandusky River spawning location. Most individuals spawning in the Sandusky River were natal to this river (73%). No statistically significant differences in the extent of homing by sex or age of spawning were found, although a potential pattern of decreased homing with increased age of fish was observed. Given the proportion of vagrant individuals we found spawning in the Sandusky River (27%), it is unlikely that Lake Erie white bass spawning populations are genetically distinct. Furthermore, the white bass population in Lake Erie appears to be structured as a metapopulation, with non-philopatric individuals serving as a link between spawning populations.

The applicability of many conclusions regarding the functioning of these environments around the world is limited due to the scant ecological knowledge of some endemic species recorded in the assemblages of Argentine lakes. The aims of this work were to determine the effects of salinity and inorganic turbidity on the taxonomic composition, abundance, and zooplankton biomass in a shallow, hypereutrophic, mesosaline lake in the north of La Pampa province characterized by seasonality, variations in level and salinity, and the lack of macrophytes and fishes, and to compare it with other shallow lakes of the province. We found important differences with other saline lakes: the species richness was lower; the mean abundance of zooplankton was between four and six times higher; and rotifers, which were not affected by salinity or the concentration of inorganic suspended solids, were numerically predominant. Crustaceans, on the other hand, were negatively affected by these environmental factors. Biomass was twofold higher than that recorded in the same period in two shallow lakes of Pampa, with similar nutrient concentrations but lower salinities.																			0718-560X	0717-7178					2011	39	2					306	315		10.3856/vol39-issue2-fulltext-12	http://dx.doi.org/10.3856/vol39-issue2-fulltext-12													WOS:000297978800012

Zooplankton composition in Lake Varano (Adriatic Sea coast, Italy)	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The zooplankton composition of Lake Varano has been studied from June 2007 to May 2008 considering three sampling stations (western, central, eastern). A total of 55 zooplankton categories were recognised, with medusae Aurelia aurita as the main macroscopic species; 43 of them occurred in less than 50% of the 71 samples collected, highlighting the seasonal aspect of the community. The remaining 12 categories, present in more than 50% of samples, were numerically dominated by the copepod 'Non Indigenous Species' Acartia tonsa (reported here for the first time in the lake), which occurred throughout the year. Maximal abundance of zooplankton was recorded in the eastern sampling station, while the lowest values were recorded in the central one. The statistical analysis of data allowed us to establish a not sharp separation of the three sampling stations, apart from isolated dates. The present zooplankton assemblage showed that about 40% of its components differed from those recorded in a study of 18 years before. This last comparison is not easily referable to the ongoing climate warming (the dominant species are of cold temperate origin) and analysis of uninterrupted time series could be useful to understand the underlying reasons.

Nutrient and light limitation of periphyton in selected streams in Ireland	INLAND WATERS												This study was undertaken to improve knowledge on the role of both phosphorus and nitrogen in eutrophication of riverine systems. The potential for nutrient limitation of algal biomass was examined during the early growth season in 4 good water quality Irish streams. Four treatments using nutrient diffusing substrata were employed in each river to test algal growth responses to addition of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and a combination of N and P at 3 concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mol/L) as well as a control (agar only) in open and closed canopy over a 21 d period. The ambient streamwater nutrient concentrations from all streams remained at low levels with high N: P ratios. Results indicated that algal biomass as chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was significantly greater at all sites located in open canopy than at the closed canopy sites, implicating light as the first limiting factor in the studied streams. Periphyton response to the nutrient treatments was varied: one stream responded significantly to N addition, indicating N limitation; 2 streams were co-limited by both N and P; and a fourth stream did not show significant responses to any treatment. Phosphorus did not seem to be the sole limiting nutrient for algal biofilm in 4 examined Irish streams at this time of year (May-Jun). There was no significant difference in Chl-a concentrations in response to the applied nutrient concentrations for most sites in the open canopy; there was some response in the closed-canopy sites.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2011	1	2					74	80		10.5268/IW-1.2.341	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-1.2.341													WOS:000307720900001

The annual runoff distribution for dry season of Hukou station, located at the outlet of Poyang in 2000s has increased, compared to previous years. And the percentage of runoff in September and October has also increased, compared to 1990s in last century. The water exchange coefficient was 0.51 in the year 2006, which means nearly stable effect between the Yangtze River and the Poyang Lake. Meanwhile, the Poyang Lake provide water supply up to 1564x10(8)m(3), accounts for about 23% of the Datong runoff in the same period, and 5% more than the normal year. This is the main reason that the discharge maintained more than 10000m(3)/s at Datong all over the year 2006, reaching a positive phenomenon of 'no drought in dry season' (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Chemical profile of the North American native Myriophyllum sibiricum compared to the invasive M. spicatum	AQUATIC BOTANY												Myriophyllum spicatum L. is a nonindigenous invasive plant in North America that can displace the closely related native Myriophyllum sibiricum Komarov. We analyzed the chemical composition (including: C, N, P, polyphenols, lignin, nonpolar extractables, and sugars) of M. spicatum and M. sibiricum and determined how the chemistry of the two species varied by plant part with growing environment (lake versus tank), irradiance (full sun versus 50% shading), and season (July through September). M. spicatum had higher concentrations of carbon, polyphenols and lignin (C: 47%; polyphenols: 5.5%; lignin: 18%) than M. sibiricum (C: 42%; polyphenols: 3.7%; lignin: 9%) while M. sibiricum had a higher concentration of ash under all conditions (12% versus 8% for M. spicatum). Apical meristems of both species had the highest concentration of carbon, polyphenols, and tellimagrandin H, followed by leaves and stems. Tellimagrandin II was present in apical meristems of both M. spicatum (24.6 mg g(-1) dm) and M. sibiricum (11.1 mg g(-1) dm). Variation in irradiance from 490 (shade) to 940 (sun) mu mol of photons m(-2) s(-1) had no effect on C, N, and polyphenol concentrations, suggesting that light levels above 490 mu mol of photons m(-2) s(-1) do not alter chemical composition. The higher concentration of polyphenols and lignin in M. spicatum relative to M. sibiricum may provide advantages that facilitate invasion and displacement of native plants. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

An assessment of the diffuse pollution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from a small town and their risks to the township stream network was conducted at Yangtze River delta. This assessment is based on measurements of 16 PAHs from the US EPA priority list by GC-MS in stream water during rainy and dry season, street dusts with different particle sizes, river sediments and suspended solids of urban runoff. The maximum level of PAHs in the stream water (2,323-4,948 ng L(-1)) were found during rainy season, while significantly lower PAHs concentrations (242-998 ng L(-1)) were measured during dry season. The total PAHs ranged from 1,629 to 8,986 mu gkg(-1) in the street dusts. Approximately 55% of the total PAHs were associated with street dust particles of diameters less than 250 mu m and these accounted for 40% of the total. The town reaches sediments were rich in PAHs and it was suggested as the sink of street dusts. The research findings suggested that size of street dusts, the topographical and hydrological features of the landscape in the stream network were the important factors influencing PAH emitted to the receiving water. The contribution of urban surface runoff could significantly influence PAHs concentration in the stream water. To reduce the pollution of street dust into the stream network, the buffer zone along the hydrological pathway is suggested and the existing street cleaning methods should also be improved.

J	Zhu, R; Wang, H; Shen, H; Deng, XW; Chen, J				Zhu, Rong; Wang, Huan; Shen, Hong; Deng, Xuwei; Chen, Jun			The dynamics and release characteristics of microcystins in the plateau Lake Erhai, Southwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Microcystins (MCs) have seriously polluted drinking water supplies and have caused great harm to aquatic organisms and humans. Understanding the dynamics of MC concentrations and its influencing factors is necessary for drinking water safety. Many previous studies on MC pollution focused on intracellular MCs rather than on extracellular MCs, which are more difficult to remove by water treatment. So far, the release characteristics of MCs and the relationships between intracellular and extracellular MCs are still unclear. To explore these questions, a survey was conducted at 18 sites across Lake Erhai from May 2014 to April 2015 as in Lake Erhai the frequency and coverage area of cyanobacterial blooms have been increasing. Variation of extracellular MCs lagged behind that of intracellular MCs. The highest value of intracellular MCs was 1.07 mu g L-1 in October 2014 and the highest extracellular MC concentration was 0.035 mu g L-1 in November 2014. Intracellular MCs were positively influenced by MC-producing cyanobacterial biomass, water temperature (WT), pH, and conductivity (Cond). The extracellular MCs showed little correlation with cyanobacterial abundances and intracellular MC concentrations, but showed significant negative correlations with WT, pH, and Cond. These results indicated that high biomass and high intracellular MC concentrations did not quickly lead to large releases of MCs, and that when cyanobacterial cells died and blooms disappeared, MCs were intensively released into the water, posing the greatest threat to drinking water supply.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2021	28	18					23473	23481		10.1007/s11356-020-12312-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12312-8		JAN 2021						33452641					WOS:000607998900001

However, no signs of double-diffusive convection were observed before December 2002, when a set of 26 well-mixed layers with thicknesses of 0.2-2.1 m and sharp interfaces in between were discovered at 53-74 m depth. Such pronounced steps are a characteristic feature of double-diffusive convection of the diffusive regime. A temperature time series measured at 62 m depth indicates that the double-diffusive convection started in the second half of March 2002. The trigger was most probably the cooling at the top of this layer caused by relatively strong seasonal convective mixing down to 52.5 m depth during the dry season in February 2002. The heat fluxes calculated by the heat budget method and the thicknesses of the layers agree within the uncertainties with the values expected from the double-diffusive flux laws. The heat fluxes increased by an order of magnitude since the establishment of the double-diffusive convection and reached values comparable to the heat input by a source of warm and CO2-enriched water to the deepest zone of the water column. In contrast, the CO2 fluxes caused by double diffusion Lire negligible compared to the input by this source. Because the double-diffusive heat fluxes were higher in the upper layers of the staircase compared to the lower ones, the temperature gradient between 60 and 75 m depth approximately doubled from March 2002 to December 2002, whereas the total dissolved solids gradient remained almost constant during this period. Consequently, this process is reducing the stability of the staircase and could potentially lead to a complete homogenization of this zone within a few years. It cannot be excluded that a similar double-diffusive event could have been the trigger of the CO2 eruption in 1986. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Plans to meet water needs are faced by uprising challenges to improve water quality and to ensure the sustainability of hydro-projects. Environmental isotopes coupled to water physicochemical characteristics were investigated over a biennial cycle to assess both geomorphological and environmental impacts on the water quality of a reservoir situated in an intensively used agricultural watershed under a Mediterranean semi-arid climate. The particularity of the semi-arid climate and the diverse topography generate a continental and orographic rain effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation and the water recharged sources. The studied reservoir responds quickly to land-use activities and climatic changes as reflected by temporal and spatial variations of water chemistry and isotopic composition. Increasing changes in precipitation rate and dry periods significantly modified the water isotopic composition in the reservoir. During the first year, hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopes are depleted by 6 and 2%(0) between dry and wet season, respectively. While a shift of -2%(0) for delta D and -1%(0) for delta O-18 was detected during the second annual cycle. Environmental isotopic compositions demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of groundwater inflow to the central (Cz) and dam (Dz) zones of the Qaraaoun reservoir. The Cz and Dz can be considered as open water bodies subjected to dilution by groundwater inflow, which induces vertical mixing and reverse isotopic stratification of the water column. In the contrary, the river mouth zone acts as a closed system without groundwater intrusion, where heavy water accumulates and may act as a sink for contaminants during dry season. Groundwater influx acts as a dilution factor that renews the hypolimnion, and minimizes the perturbations induced by both internal biogeochemical reactions and external hydrological variations. Attention should be devoted to the hydrogeological location of planned reservoirs, which should take into account the vicinity of shallow water table to insure good water quality and water sustainability.

Modeling the atmospheric transport and deposition of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in North America	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The atmospheric fate of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) was simulated for the year 2000 in North America using a SMOKE/CMAQ-based chemical transport model that was modified for this purpose. The 1999 USEPA emission inventories of PCDD/Fs and criteria pollutants were used. The 1995 Canadian emission inventory of criteria pollutants and the 1995 Canadian area source emissions for PCDD/Fs were used with the 2000 Canadian point source emissions. Modifications to CMAQ involved coupling it with dual organic matter (OM) absorption and black carbon (BC) adsorption models to calculate PCDD/F gas-particle partitioning. The model satisfactorily reproduced the particle bound fractions at all rural sites for which there were measured data and across the whole domain, the modeled vs. measured differences in particle bound fractions were less than 20% for nearly all congeners. The model predicted ambient air PCDD/F concentrations were also consistent with measurements. Simulated deposition fluxes were within 58% of direct measurements. PCDD/F atmospheric depositions to each of the Great Lakes were estimated for the year 2000. The results indicate that approximately 76% of the total deposition of PCDD/Fs to the Great Lakes (in W-TEQ or toxic equivalent units as defined by the World Health Organization) is attributed to PCDD/Fs absorbed into OM in aerosol. For all of the lakes, more than 92% of all deposition is particle phase wet deposition and only 5-8% is particle phase dry deposition. Wet deposition from the gas phase is negligible. Of the 17 toxic PCDD/F congeners, the Cl4-5DD/F compounds contribute approximately 70% to the total atmospheric deposition to the Great Lakes.

J	Dechruksa, W; Krailas, D; Glaubrecht, M				Dechruksa, Wivitchuta; Krailas, Duangduen; Glaubrecht, Matthias			Evaluating the status and identity of "Melania" jugicostis Hanley & Theobald, 1876-an enigmatic thiarid gastropod in Thailand (Caenogastropoda, Cerithioidea)	ZOOSYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												Given the importance in tropical diseases caused by food-borne trematodes infecting humans, it is essential to understand the taxonomy and distribution of its first intermediate hosts, which are in Southeast Asia freshwater Cerithioidean gastropods such as the widely distributed Melanoides tuberculata. Next to the occurrence of this type species in Thailand there is a second, congeneric thiarid neglected and, therefore, remained enigmatic to date. Described as Melania jugicostis by Hanley & Theobald (1876) it was originally reported and only known from the type locality, Tenasserim River (i.e. Tanintharyi River) of Southeast Burma (today Myanmar), but later recorded also for Thailand based on shell morphology. In evaluating the status of this taxon, we here report on its geographical occurrence ranging from the Kanchanaburi Province to the southern most provinces in Thailand (anticipating that it might extend further south on the Malay Peninsula and even into Sumatra). Based on the more detailed study of material from five locations we provide conchological and anatomical evidence for the comparison with other thiarids, in particular the closely related Melanoides tuberculata and Pseudoplotia scabra. Interestingly, with respect to its reproductive mode we found in one population of M. jugicostis from Erawan waterfall, Kanchanaburi Province, the lack of any sign of a subhaemocoelic brood pouch otherwise typical for viviparous thiarids. This is discussed in context of climatic factors (e.g. seasonal changing precipitation), but anticipated to be caused by an unusually high infection rate of human intestinal trematodes. These parasites having infected 98 of 222 snails studied, resulting in an infection rate of 44.14 %, are assumed to be responsible for the sterility of the females in this particular population, in comparison with considerable lower infection rates in two other populations, viz. Raman waterfall (1.74 % in 5/288) and Klong Chalung (9.46 % in 7/74), respectively. ((c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Ammonium treatments to suppress toxic blooms of Prymnesium parvum in a subtropical lake of semi-arid climate: Results from in situ mesocosm experiments	WATER RESEARCH												Prymnesium parvum is a haptophyte alga that forms toxic, fish-killing blooms in a variety of brackish coastal and inland waters. Its abundance and toxicity are suppressed by ammonium additions in laboratory cultures and aquaculture ponds. In a cove of a large reservoir (Lake Granbury, Texas, USA) with recurring, seasonal blooms of P. parvum, ammonium additions were tested in mesocosm enclosures for their ability to suppress blooms and their effects on non-target planktonic organisms. One experiment occurred prior to the peak abundance of a P. parvum bloom in the cove, and one encompassed the peak abundance and decline of the bloom. During 21-day experiments, weekly doses raised ammonium concentrations by either 10 or 40 mu M. The added ammonium accumulated in experimental mesocosms, with little uptake by biota or other losses. Effects of ammonium additions generally increased over the course of the experiments. The higher ammonium dose suppressed the abundance and toxicity of P. parvum. The biomass of non-haptophyte algae was stimulated by ammonium additions, while positive, negative and neutral effects on zooplankton taxa were observed. Low ammonium additions insufficient to control P. parvum exacerbated its harmful effects. Our results indicate a potential for mitigating blooms of P. parvum with sufficient additions of ammonium to coves of larger lakes. However, factors excluded from mesocosms, such as dilution of ammonium by water exchange and sediment ammonium uptake, could reduce the effectiveness of such additions, and they would entail a risk of eutrophication from the added nitrogen.

Constitutive but no Triops-induced differences in bet-hedging strategies for hatching in Daphnia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Since cladocerans from the genus Daphnia are known to have evolved several inducible defenses (morphological and life history shifts) against the notostracan predator Triops, we investigated whether hatching was also altered in response to Triops. We tested whether dormant eggs of Daphnia magna are able to detect Triops cancriformis kairomones in the water as a signal of predation pressure and alter their hatching response accordingly to avoid predation. We predicted that, in the presence of Triops kairomones, hatching fractions might be reduced (postponing hatching to a next growing season) and/or that hatching might peak earlier (increasing chances to reproduce before Triops becomes predatory). We also tested whether this response depended on the origin of the population. Ephippia from three D. magna populations, originating from one permanent lake and two temporary pond systems, were exposed to Triops kairomone and control treatments. We observed significant population differences in hatching patterns, both in terms of the fraction of eggs that hatch as well as the timing of hatching, with evidence for within-season bet-hedging through delayed hatching in the populations inhabiting temporary habitats. However, no indication was found that the populations also adjust their hatching pattern to the presence of Triops kairomones.					; Vanoverbeke, Joost/B-6891-2012; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015; Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/I-9021-2019	Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420; Vanoverbeke, Joost/0000-0002-3893-9529; Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/0000-0002-8973-6297; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; 													0018-8158					SEP	2013	715	1					29	35		10.1007/s10750-012-1299-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1299-2													WOS:000322901200004
J	Campbell, JM				Campbell, J. Michael			The effect of education in reducing bear attractants on cottage properties: Manitoba's "Bear Smart" program	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS												Over the past decades there has been an increase in negative interactions between humans and bears. In response to these concerns a number of initiatives such as Bear Smart, Bear Aware and Bear Wise have evolved to help communities learn to deal with bears. All these programs share the goals of educating people about how to avoid attracting bears to their property or campsite, changing behaviors that serve to attract bears and what to do should a bear approach. This study examines the efficacy of the Bear Smart program in two cottage communities along the shores of Lake Winnipeg. Audits of bear attractants were conducted on cottage properties prior to and after the implementation of the Bear Smart awareness program. In addition, a population survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior was conducted in order to identify attitudes and intentions with respect to bear smart behavior. Results indicate that despite the educational programming conducted throughout the cottaging season and positive attitudes toward bear smart behavior, little had actually been done by cottagers to reduce their cottage properties' attractiveness to bears. The results of the property bear attractant audits showed minimal effect in terms of reduced attractants on cottage properties in either of the two communities. While on the surface this might suggest that the targeted multi channel educational programs were not effective in changing behavior, it is possible that the effect was masked by the normal seasonal increase in attractants as the cottage season progressed. In particular behaviors relating to the proper handling of food and garbage elicited very positive attitude scores. When considered in light of the evaluation of removing bird feeders (with and without food) where 16% and 24% respectively state removing feeders is quite to very unacceptable, the issue of communicating the role of bird feeders as an attraction is perhaps the most important message to convey successfully. The Theory of Planned Behavior allowed examination into the constituent components of these attitudes that were not positively evaluated by all cottagers and provides insight to direct future communication and awareness programs.

The sediments of Zhada basin in the late Miocene to Pliocene consist of lacustrine and fluvial deposits >800 m thick and can be subdivided into five clay assemblage zones based on their clay-mineral composition. The upward zonation is as follows: (1) smectite-kaolinite; (2) illite-chlorite; (3) chlorite-illite-kaolinite; (4) illite-chlorite; and (5) smectite, illite, and kaolinite. The ratio of chlorite + illite to kaolinite + smectite (Ch+I/K+S) and the Kubler index indicate a warm and humid climate from 9.5 to 8.4 Ma, a cold and dry climate from 8.4 to 7.2 Ma, a warm and seasonal arid climate from 7.2 to 4.5 Ma, a cool and humid climate from 4.5 to 3.6 Ma, and a warm and seasonally humid climate from 3.6 to 3.0 Ma. Intense fluctuations in the Kubler index and in the quantities of evaporite minerals dolomite, aragonite, and gypsum, during the period 7.2-4.5 Ma suggest strong climatic fluctuations between humid and seasonally humid conditions in the Zhada basin. Rapid uplift around the Zhada basin occurred at 8.4 and 3.6 Ma, with sharp subsidence at 7.2 and 4.5 Ma. Evolution of the climate at Zhada showed a different model from that of global climate change, and tectonics-led climate change was the major contributor to climate evolution in the area.

J	Moura, AD; do Nascimento, EC; Dantas, EW				Moura, Ariadne do Nascimento; do Nascimento, Emanuel Cardoso; Dantas, Enio Wocyli			Temporal and spatial dynamics of phytoplankton near farm fish in eutrophic reservoir in Pernambuco, Brazil	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton communities in continental waters have received attention from limnologists, since they are differently influenced by many physico-chemical and biological factors. This study was undertaken with the aim to identify the environmental variables that influence the temporal and spatial dynamics of the phytoplankton near a fish farm in the Jucazinho reservoir, in a semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil. Samples were taken from three sampling sites, at two depths during the rainy (Aug 2008, Feb and Mar 2009) and dry (Oct, Nov and Dec 2008) seasons. Phytoplankton was identified, density determined, and biomass values obtained. Concomitantly, abiotic analyses were performed for the characterization of the system. The reservoir was homogeneous with regard to the spatial-temporal variation in hydrological variables: water well oxygenated at the surface and anoxic at the bottom; pH ranging from neutral to alkaline; temperatures always above 25 degrees C; high turbidity; and high electrical conductivity at all sampling sites and both depths. For both seasons, there was limited nitrogen and high concentrations of phosphorus. Cyanophyta species were predominant, generally representing 80% of the phytoplankton biomass throughout practically the entire study, at all sampling sites and both depths. Co-dominance of cyanobacteria belonging to H1, MP, S1 and Sn associations was recorded in most of the months studied, except August 2008, when there was a substitution of the Si association (Planktothrix agardhii) by the P association (Aulacoseira granulata). Water temperature, precipitation and pH were the parameters with the greatest influence over the temporal variation in phytoplankton, whereas the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton biomass was directly related to the availability of light in the water column. There were no spatial or temporal differences in water quality, likely due to the fact that the sampling sites were near to one another and received the same nutrients stemming from the rations given to the fish as well as their excrement. The predominance of cyanobacteria through the study was certainly due to the influence of the feeding products offered to and excreted from the fish, which eutrophicated the system. In temporal terms, the change in the algal structure is explained by the change in the physical conditions of the water between the surface and bottom, as well as the climatologic conditions, especially the change in wind direction, with the consequent fetch of the water.

J	Tuttle, KN; Gregory, PT				Tuttle, Krysia N.; Gregory, Patrick T.			Growth and maturity of a terrestrial ectotherm near its northern distributional limit: does latitude matter?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												High-latitude environments are challenging for terrestrial ectotherms because short and cool active seasons generally limit the time available for foraging and growth, thereby negatively influencing life-history variables such as growth rate and age at maturity and ultimately, via fitness differences, their evolution. Many species show latitudinal clines in life-history traits, including growth rate and body size. We estimated growth curves of Plains Garter Snakes (Thamnophis radix (Baird and Girard, 1853)) near the northern limit of the species' range in central Alberta and compared our findings to similar estimates for more southerly populations. Despite a short growing season, female T. radix at Miquelon Lake grew rapidly, reaching maturity in 1 or 2 years, similar to southern populations, and attained greater maximum sizes than snakes in southern populations. Overall, growth in this high-latitude population is comparable with what is seen in other conspecific populations. Possible reasons for lack of marked latitudinal effect include longer days at high latitudes, highly productive aquatic habitats for foraging, effective thermoregulation, reduced competition, and (or) countergradient variation in growth rate.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				JUN	2012	90	6					758	765		10.1139/Z2012-044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z2012-044													WOS:000304771200010

Part I: Modeling Tropical Lake Levels	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The availability of satellite estimates of rainfall and lake levels offers exciting new opportunities to estimate the hydrologic properties of lake systems. Combined with simple basin models, connections to climatic variations can then be explored with a focus on a future ability to predict changes in storage volume for water resources or natural hazards concerns. This study examines the capability of a simple basin model to estimate variations in water level for 12 tropical lakes and reservoirs during a 16-yr remotely sensed observation period (1992-2007). The model is constructed with two empirical parameters: effective catchment to lake area ratio and time delay between freshwater flux and lake level response. Rainfall datasets, one reanalysis and two satellite-based observational products, and two radar-altimetry-derived lake level datasets are explored and cross checked. Good agreement is observed between the two lake level datasets with the lowest correlations occurring for the two small lakes Kainji and Tana (0.87 and 0.89). Fitting observations to the simple basin model provides a set of delay times between rainfall and level rise ranging up to 105 days and effective catchment to lake ratios ranging between 2 and 27. For 9 of 12 lakes and reservoirs the observational rainfall products provide a better fit to observed lake levels than the reanalysis rainfall product. But for most of the records any of the rainfall products provide reasonable lake level estimates, a result which opens up the possibility of using rainfall to create seasonal forecasts of future lake levels and hindcasts of past lake levels. The limitations of the observation sets and the two-parameter model are discussed.					carton, james/C-4807-2009; Ricko, Martina/D-2638-2013; Carton, James/C-4807-2009	Carton, James/0000-0003-0598-5198													0894-8755	1520-0442				JUN	2011	24	12					2983	2999		10.1175/2010JCLI3602.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2010JCLI3602.1													WOS:000291585800006

Influence of increasing populations of Double-crested Cormorants on soil nutrient characteristics of nesting islands in western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Animals can influence the structure of an ecosystem by changing the levels of nutrient input. This is of particular importance for the islands of western Lake Erie, which are relatively nutrient poor, but have experienced increases in nutrient input from growing double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations. The objectives of this study were to evaluate changes in soil characteristics (nutrients [nitrate (NO3), total P], pH, and delta C-13 [as a tracer of cormorant-associated nutrients]) across a gradient of cormorant nest density on two islands (Middle and East Sister) in western Lake Erie. For both islands, soil pH decreased and P concentrations increased with nest density. On Middle Island, soil nitrate concentrations increased with cormorant nest density, and varied with breeding phenology, with highest concentrations during the early and mid nesting season (272 +/- 19 mu g g(-1)) and lowest concentrations late in the season (165 +/- 11 mu g g(-1)). Following a 3-year absence of nesting activity at sites on Middle Island, soil nitrate concentrations were similar to those at low density sites. In contrast, nitrate concentrations measured on East Sister Island did not correlate with temporal or spatial patterns of cormorant nesting and remained elevated 10 years post-cormorant use. While the results of this study confirm that chronic input of allochthonous materials alters soil properties of these islands, the unique conditions of each island must be considered when predicting ecological effects and setting long-term management objectives.

J	Chan, MA; Moser, K; Davis, JM; Southam, G; Hughes, K; Graham, T				Chan, MA; Moser, K; Davis, JM; Southam, G; Hughes, K; Graham, T			Desert potholes: Ephemeral aquatic microsystems	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												An enigma of the Colorado Plateau high desert is the "pothole", which ranges from shallow ephemeral puddles to deeply carved pools. The existence of prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms within these pools is largely controlled by the presence of collected rainwater. Multivariate statistical analysis of physical and chemical limnologic data variables measured from potholes indicates spatial and temporal variations, particularly in water depth, manganese, iron, nitrate and sulfate concentrations and salinity. Variation in water depth and salinity are likely related to the amount of time since the last precipitation, whereas the other variables may be related to redox potential. The spatial and temporal variations in water chemistry affect the distribution of organisms, which must adapt to daily and seasonal extremes of fluctuating temperature (0-60 degrees C), pH changes of as much as 5 units over 12 days, and desiccation. For example, many species become dormant when potholes dry, in order to endure intense heat, UV radiation, desiccation and freezing, only to flourish again upon rehydration. But the pothole organisms also have a profound impact on the potholes. Through photosynthesis and respiration, pothole organisms affect redox potential, and indirectly alter the water chemistry. Laboratory examination of dried biofilm from the potholes revealed that within 2 weeks of hydration, the surface of the desiccated, black biofilm became green from cyanobacterial growth, which supported significant growth in heterotrophic bacterial populations. This complex biofilm is persumably responsible for dissolving the cement between the sandstone grains, allowing the potholes to enlarge, and for sealing the potholes, enabling them to retain water longer than the surrounding sandstone. Despite the remarkable ability of life in potholes to persist, desert potholes may be extremely sensitive to anthropogenic effects. The unique limnology and ecology of Utah potholes holds great scientific value for understanding water-rock-biological interactions with possible applications to life on other planetary bodies.

Lakes with an area of 0.1 to 27000 ha and mean depth of 0.4-5.6 m located in low to high altitudes were investigated within the EC project ECOFRAME 1-4 times during June-October 2000-2001. Several variables like conductivity, alkalinity, abundance of submerged plants, concentrations of suspended solids, total nitrogen and phosphorus were latitude-dependent decreasing from south to north. Secchi depth, concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solids, and chlorophyll a correlated strongly with the presumed quality classes of the lakes. We came to the conclusion that the variability of shallow lakes in Europe is still mostly dependent on natural differences. Variables connected to lake morphometry, seasonality, basin geology and climate explained altogether nearly half of the total variability of lakes. The trophic state factor, describing mostly the human influence on lakes, was the strongest single factor responsible for nearly a quarter of the total variability of the studied European lakes.					; Ligęza, Sławomir/AAS-9851-2021; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020; Peczula, Wojciech/T-6681-2018; Becares, Eloy/H-6361-2015; Gross, Elisabeth/B-3061-2009; Smal, Halina/U-6002-2018; Ferriol, Carmen/AAC-4591-2020; Kornijów, Ryszard/AEX-3635-2022; Tuvikene, Lea/H-8799-2016; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Pęczuła, Wojciech/T-6681-2018; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/L-7321-2014; Gross, Elisabeth Maria/B-3061-2009; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; García-Criado, Francisco/AAC-6024-2019; Fernández-Aláez, Camino/K-5292-2014; Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013	van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850; ferriol, carmen/0000-0001-9961-7040; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Peczula, Wojciech/0000-0002-6760-4189; Garcia-Criado, Francisco/0000-0003-3419-7086; Smal, Halina/0000-0001-5604-4959; Becares, Eloy/0000-0002-7123-3579; Tuvikene, Lea/0000-0001-6041-5900; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/0000-0001-9385-1354; Gross, Elisabeth Maria/0000-0002-9392-8582; van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					51	58		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008541.36537.51	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008541.36537.51													WOS:000188455600008
J	Longhi, D; Bartoli, M; Nizzoli, D; Viaroli, P				Longhi, Daniele; Bartoli, Marco; Nizzoli, Daniele; Viaroli, Pierluigi			Benthic processes in fresh water fluffy sediments undergoing resuspension	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In the Po river plain relict freshwater wetlands are characterised by a low free water to emergent macrophyte surface ratio, rapid infilling and fluffy sediments, undergoing frequent resuspension. Particle mixing should alter the steep gradients of dissolved gas, nutrient and organic matter quality that generally characterise sediments, with implications for benthic processes. Sediment features and solute fluxes were studied from December 2003 to February 2005 within the Busatello swamp complex (Northern Italy) by means of a combination of core incubation, porewater extraction and microprofiling. At the study site, along a 10 cm vertical profile, sediment organic matter content (32.5%), porosity (0.94) and density (1.02 g cm(-3)) were nearly constant. Oxygen demand measured by dark core incubation (12.7-56.9 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was strongly correlated with water temperature. Rates agreed reasonably well with diffusive oxygen fluxes calculated from microprofiles while ammonium and phosphorus regeneration rates predicted from porewater gradients (-309.3-43.4 and -0.1-0.7 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively) were significantly lower than rates measured via core incubations (-129.8-5420.5 and -120.4-35.4 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively). This is a probable consequence of insufficient vertical resolution of nutrient profiles and lack of steady state conditions. A sediment resuspension experiment, carried out under controlled laboratory conditions, indicated large instantaneous oxygen and nitrate consumption, a transient increase of denitrification rates and the rapid release of ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus. In unconsolidated sediments, resuspension and mixing of sediment particles are key processes regulating mineralisation rates and benthic-pelagic coupling.					bartoli, marco/E-5321-2017; Bartoli, Marco/E-5321-2017; nizzoli, daniele/AAM-3083-2021; Viaroli, Pierluigi/M-3762-2014	bartoli, marco/0000-0002-5022-6206; Longhi, Daniele/0000-0002-2886-2775; Viaroli, Pierluigi/0000-0002-6396-2894													1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	1					1	12		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e1	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e1													WOS:000324041400001

Using a multistage sampling design with semi-structured interviews, the study asked three main questions: (i) are manatees still present in Lower Sanaga Basin? (ii) If present, how are their numbers evolving with time? (iii) What are the main threats facing the manatee? Each of these questions led to the formulation and formal testing of a scientific hypothesis. The study outcome is as follows: (i) 60% of respondents sighted manatees at least once a month, regardless of habitat type (rivers, lakes, or coast) and seasons (dry, rainy, or both); (ii) depending on habitat type, 69 to 100% of respondents perceived the trend in manatee numbers as either constant or increasing; the increasing trend was ascribed to low kill incidence (due either to increased awareness or lack of adequate equipment) and to high reproduction rate; and (iii) catches (directed or incidental) and habitat degradation (pollution) ranked in decreasing order as perceived threats to manatees. The catch incidence is threefold larger on lakes than in rivers and more adult manatees are caught than juveniles. Pollution occurs in several places by fishing enterprises, industrial plantations and individuals. The perceived incidence of boat collisions is presently negligible compared to catches and habitat degradation. A twelve-point strategy is set forth for improving manatee conservation in the study area.																			1940-0829						2013	6	4					521	538		10.1177/194008291300600406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/194008291300600406													WOS:000332704600007
J	Sterner, RW; George, NB				Sterner, RW; George, NB			Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of cyprinid fishes	ECOLOGY												We investigated the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels in whole fish and gut samples of several species of cyprinids, relating our findings to nutrient flux models. Some differences in whole-fish nutrient content across species, lakes, and seasons, as well as differences across fish length and mass, were found. N and P contents were highest in fathead minnows and lowest in pearl dace, with northern redbelly dace and finescale dace intermediate. Larger fish had higher percent C and lower percent N and P. However, all differences in whole fish C, N, and P chemistry were small. Cyprinids had the following mean composition: carbon, 46%; nitrogen, 9.7%; and phosphorus, 1.5%. The cyprinid molar C:N:P ratio was 242:16:1. These values make cyprinids relatively low in phosphorus compared to other fish that have been previously studied, especially members of the Percidae and Centrarchidae. Gut contents were lower in N and P than the whole fish, and C:N and C:P ratios were correspondingly higher in gut contents than in the whole fish. Thus, minnows must concentrate both of these nutrients within their biomass compared to what they eat. The N:P ratio of minnows and minnow gut contents had nearly identical means. All chemical variables showed lower variation in the fish than in the gut contents, supporting a homeostatic model of nutrient flux. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis found that minnows were similar to 3 parts per thousand (parts per thousand) heavier than their gut contents, providing evidence that gut contents analyzed were derived mainly from ingested material. A homeostatic nutrient model appears to be an appropriate one for fish.

J	Modi, P; Chintalacheruvu, MR				Modi, Prakhar; Chintalacheruvu, Madhusudana Rao			Investigating river water quality assessment through non-parametric analysis: A case study of the Godavari River in India	ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT												This study examines temporal variations in water quality parameters of Godavari River. The present study examines the concentrations of seven water quality parameters, namely total alkalinity (Alk), calcium (Ca), chlorine (Cl), total hardness (Hard), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and sulfate (SO4), using data from 1981 to 2005 at seven gauging stations, that is, Mancherial, Pathagudem, Nowrangpur, Jagdalpur, Perur, Konta, and Polavaram. A seasonal analysis (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) is conducted to detect trends in water quality parameters. The study also uses normality tests Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and Shapiro-Wilk (S-W) which reveals nonnormal distribution in the majority of datasets, necessitating non-parametric analysis. The concentration of Alk, Ca, and Hard is found to be significantly increasing trend at some stations during all three seasons, along with significantly decreasing trend found in the concentrations of Cl, Na, and SO4 using non-parametric Mann-Kendall's (M-K) and Sen's Slope test. The concentration of Mg depicts mixed trends at different stations which may be due the variation in agricultural practices or industrial activities surrounding the stations. It is evident that none of the parameter exhibits statistically significant trends across all seasons at any station. The results of Sen's Slope test are found to be in good agreement with Mann-Kendall's test statistics. A second order auto-regressive model (AR (2)) is successfully employed to predict and forecast the water quality parameters in present and future time steps. The authenticity of AR (2) model is assessed using Nash-Sutcliffe (NSE) efficiency and coefficient of determination (R2). The values of NSE and R2 are found to be more than 0.85 for all parameters during all the three seasons, along with, the values of mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results of coefficient of variation (CV) and persistence-criterion (PC) also depicts that AR (2) can successfully be utilized in forecasting the water quality parameters. The research contributes insights for effective water resource management in Godavari River basin.

Data gaps, cloud contamination, variations in atmospheric profiles of temperature and moisture, and a lack of in situ observations provide challenges for satellite-derived LSWT for climatological analysis or input into geophysical models. In this study, the Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) analysis of LSWT is evaluated between 2007 and 2015 over a small (Lake Oneida), medium (Lake Okeechobee), and large (Lake Michigan) lake. The advantages of the MUR LSWT analyses include daily consistency, high-resolution (similar to 1 km), near-real time production, and multi-platform data synthesis. The MUR LSWT versus in situ measurements for Lake Michigan (Lake Okeechobee) have an overall bias (MUR LSWT-in situ) of -0.20 degrees C (0.31 degrees C) and a RMSE of 0.86 degrees C (0.91 degrees C). The MUR LSWT versus in situ measurements for Lake Oneida have overall large biases (-1.74 degrees C) and RMSE (3.42 degrees C) due to a lack of available satellite imagery over the lake, but performs better during the less cloudy 15 July-30 September period. The results of this study highlight the importance of calculating validation statistics on a seasonal and annual basis for evaluating satellite-derived LSWT.

Duckling Survival of Mallards in Southland, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The southern portion of New Zealand's South Island is a productive area for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) despite a notable lack of permanent or semi-permanent wetlands. Most broods are reared in pastures that may or may not be flooded with ephemeral water. In recent years, there has been an increased conversion from continuous to sporadic grazing that has resulted in a functional change in the emergent and upland vegetation available for broods. In 2014, we investigated mallard duckling survival on different pastures relative to a suite of characteristics pertaining to the adult female, clutch, brood, weather, and habitat. We monitored 438 ducklings from 50 radio-marked females to 30 days post-hatch. Duckling survival was unaffected by pasture type but increased with duckling age, the presence of ephemeral water, and with greater distance from the nearest anthropogenic structure. Survival was lower for broods of second year (SY) females than for broods of after-second year (ASY) females, in areas with more dense cover, and when ducklings moved, on average, greater daily distances. Cumulative 30-day duckling survival ranged from 0.11 for ducklings of SY females without ephemeral water present to 0.46 for ducklings of ASY females with ephemeral water present. Therefore, increasing available seasonal water sources may increase duckling survival. Further, narrow, linear patches of dense cover present in our study could support a greater abundance of predators or increase their foraging efficiency. As such, managers could consider increasing patch sizes of dense cover to reduce predator efficiency, and employing predator removal in these areas to improve duckling survival.

Diurnal Behavior of the Flux and Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide in the Surface Water in Solar Time Coordinates (the Period of Open Water in the South Baikal Littoral in 2004-2015)	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												A long-term series of regular measurements of the carbon dioxide concentration in the surface water and CO2 fluxes in the Baikal littoral zone demonstrated a diurnal rhythm related to processes of photosynthesis activity of plankton during the entire period of open water (from May to December). To isolate the role of only the photoperiodicity process on the background of many various factors having an effect on the change in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the surface water and CO2 fluxes in the atmosphere-water system, the scheme of the diurnal behavior of CO2 during the open water period in 2007-2015 in the littoral zone of South Baikal is considered in coordinates of sunshine duration which was calculated proceeding from the theoretically possible sunshine duration (from sunrise to sunset in the case of clear sky and open horizon). The proposed scheme of parameterization and reconstruction of these characteristics for any time instant can find application in estimating calculations in carbon cycle models and be useful in planning the optimum regime for studying biological and chemical processes in Lake Baikal.

Mercury and other element exposure to tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) nesting on Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge, North Dakota	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Elevated mercury concentrations in water were reported in the prairie wetlands at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge, ND. In order to determine whether wildlife associated with these wetlands was exposed to and then accumulated higher mercury concentrations than wildlife living near more permanent wetlands (e.g. lakes), tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) eggs and nestlings were collected from nests near seasonal wetlands, semi-permanent wetlands, and lakes. Mercury concentrations in eggs collected near seasonal wetlands were higher than those collected near semi-permanent wetlands or lakes. In contrast, mercury concentrations in nestling livers did not differ among wetland types. Mercury and other element concentrations in tree swallow eggs and nestlings collected from all wetlands were low. As suspected from these low concentrations, mercury concentrations in sample eggs were not a significant factor explaining the hatching success of the remaining eggs in each clutch.

Accumulation patterns of organochlorine concentrations in resident birds suggested that the predominant contaminants of each country were as follows: Japan-PCBs Philippines-PCBs and CHLs, India-HCHs and DDTs, Vietnam-DDTs, and Lake Baikal-PCBs and DDTs. The migratory birds from Philippines and Vietnam retained mostly the highest concentrations of DDTs among the organochlorines analyzed, indicating the presence of stopover and breeding grounds of those birds in China and Russia. On the other hand, migratory birds from India and Lake Baikal showed different patterns of organochlorine residues, reflecting that each species has inherent migratory routes and thus has exposure to different contaminants. Species which have breeding grounds around the Red Sea and Persian Gulf showed high levels of PCBs, indicating the presence of areas heavily polluted by PCBs in the Middle East.

J	Batáry, P; Báldi, A				Batáry, P; Báldi, A			Factors affecting the survival of real and artificial great reed warbler's nests	BIOLOGIA												Nest predation experiments are based on either real or dummy nests, and little effort has been made to perform comparative studies with both types of nests. We studied the breeding phenology of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), and compared the survival of real nests with artificial nests in May at Lake Velence, Hungary. Each artificial nest resembled a great reed warbler nest and contained one plasticine and one quail (Coturnix coturnix) egg. An additional experiment was completed during the late breeding season in July, when we used the abandoned great reed warbler nests with quail and plasticine eggs and compared their survival rates with those of artificial nests. Furthermore, we tested the effects of vegetation structure (reed-density, -height and -thickness) and the effect of other nest site characteristics (distance from edge, water depth) on nest success. Great reed warblers laid 4.88 +/- 0.074 eggs and fledged 1.72 +/- 0.194 (35.3%) nestlings based on data from 25 nests. Successful warbler broods started a week earlier than non-successful broods. Nest survival of artificial nests was lower compared to both the real great reed warbler nests and to the abandoned great reed warbler nests with quail and plasticine eggs. The nest cover (reed density and height) significantly increased the survival of both real and artificial nests, but only during the middle of the breeding season, in May.

By the use of a new analytical method, we identified methylarsenic(III) species in the growth medium of green-alga Closterium aciculare incubated under axenic conditions. The arsenate concentration in the experimental medium began to decrease just after inoculation, and the levels of arsenite and methylarsenicals increased with the growth of C. aciculare. Initially, most of the arsenate was converted into arsenite, which peaked in concentration during the exponential phase. Methylarsenicals accumulated rapidly in the stationary phase. DMAA(V) production was enhanced when the ratio of phosphate to arsenate decreased in the culture medium. The levels of DMAA(V) increased continuously toward the end of the experiment. On the other hand, methylarsenic(III) species remained relatively steady during the stationary phase. Methylarsenic(III) species accounted for 0-35% of methylarsenicals. These results suggest that arsenite and methylarsenicals (containing methylarsenic(III) species) are supplied by phytoplankton, and serve as evidence of the origin of methylarsenic(III) species in natural waters.

Towards a better understanding of C storage, transport and emission in Central Asian mountain regions, an area of knowledge that has been extremely poorly studied until now, here, we carried out systematic measurements of dissolved C and CO2 emissions in rivers and lakes located along a macrotransect of various natural landscapes in the Sayan-Altai mountain region, from the high mountains of the Western Sayan in the northwest of Tyva to the arid (dry) steppes and semideserts in the intermountain basins in the southeast of Tyva on the border with Mongolia. New data on major hydrochemical parameters and CO2 fluxes (fCO(2)) gathered by floating chambers and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively) concentrations collected over the four main hydrological seasons allowed us to assess the current C biogeochemical status of these water bodies in order to judge possible future changes under climate warming. We further tested the impact of permafrost, river watershed size, lake area and climate parameters as well as 'internal' biogeochemical drivers (pH, mineralization, organic matter quality and bacterial population) on CO2 concentration and emissions in lakes and rivers of this region and compared them with available data from other subarctic and mountain settings. We found strong environmental control of the CO2 pattern in the studied water bodies, with thermokarst lakes being drastically different from other lakes. In freshwater lakes, pCO(2) negatively correlated with O-2, whereas the water temperature exerted a positive impact on pCO(2) in large rivers. Overall, the large complexity of counteracting external and internal drivers of CO2 exchange between the water surfaces and the atmosphere (CO2-rich underground DIC influx and lateral soil and subsurface water; CO2 production in the water column due to dissolved and particulate OC biodegradation; CO2 uptake by aquatic biota) precluded establishing simple causalities between a single environmental parameter and the fCO(2 )of rivers and lakes. The season-averaged CO2 emission flux from the rivers of Tyva measured in this study was comparable, with some uncertainty, to the C uptake fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems of the region, which were assessed in other works.

Thus far, the role of attached algae, and epiphytes in particular has been understudied, although often high densities of macrophytes in these lakes may provide extensive substrate for attached algal growth. Our goal was to evaluate spatial and temporal variability in food web dynamics of three floodplain lakes permanently connected to the Usumacinta River, with emphasis on the role of epiphytes as a carbon source for upper trophic levels. To achieve this, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of water and stable isotopes of fish and invertebrate consumers and potential autochthonous (macrophytes, phytoplankton, epiphytes, epipelon) and allochthonous (terrestrial organic matter) basal resources during the rainy and dry seasons. The mixing model output highlighted the crucial role of epiphytes as the main energy pathway supporting secondary production year-round, while aquatic macrophytes were of secondary importance. The contribution of terrestrial organic matter to consumers was low, mostly limited to invertebrates, and overall increased from the rainy to the dry season, countering expectations of higher allochthony following strong seasonal flow pulses. Community-wide metrics further revealed higher trophic diversity among invertebrates as compared to fish. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving epiphytic energy pathways and macrophyte-periphyton linkages, as they provide key support to food webs of these vital fishery ecosystems.

Eco-Toxicological Risk Assessment of Possible Effects of Potentially Toxic Heavy Metals on Water Quality and Performance of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in Burullus Lake, North Delta, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE					1st Scientific Conference on One World One Health (OWOH)	OCT 05-08, 2022	Kafr Elsheikh Univ, Kafr Elsheikh, EGYPT		Kafr Elsheikh Univ			THIS study aimed to evaluate the effects of toxic metals (Cu, Fe, Ni, Cd and Pb) on Burullus Lake water and Oreochromis niloticus. To assess contamination grade and associated ecotoxicological risk use Bio-Concentration Factor (BCF), Contamination Factor (CF), Pollution Load Index (PLI), and Metal Pollution Index (MPI) and in addition to the effect of toxic metals on water quality and fish performance in sixteen sampling sites across the lake. Results revealed a significant (p<0.05) lower heavy metals concentration in water, liver and muscles in eastern sector (ES) compared to other sectors. While, middle sector (MS) showed significant ( p<0.05) lower BCF of Fe in liver and muscle. The ES showed the lowest CF, PLI and MPI values in water, liver and muscles except for Fe in muscle CF. Furthermore, ES recorded the lowest salinity, conductivity, total dissolved salts, total ammonia and un-ionized ammonia and the highest dissolved oxygen. Moreover, ES showed the highest fish body weight (p>0.05) and condition factor and the lowest hepatosomatic index (p<0.05). In conclusion, there was a variation in heavy metals content in different sections of the Burullus lake water, ES showed lower heavy metals concentration in water, liver and muscles compared to other sectors. MS showed significant lower BCF of Fe in liver and muscle. The ES showed the lowest CF, PLI and MPI values in water, liver and muscles except for Fe in muscle CF. The ES may consider the lowest contaminated area of Burullus Lake and consequently showed better water quality and fish performance.					; Mohamed, Radi/AAR-5070-2020	Abozeid, Ahmed/0000-0002-9878-9331; 													1110-0222	2357-089X				OCT	2023	54	7					181	197		10.21608/EJVS.2023.236642.1615	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/EJVS.2023.236642.1615													WOS:001152861100018

The Subglacial Lake That Wasn't There: Improved Interpretation From Seismic Data Reveals a Sediment Bedform at Isunnguata Sermia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Radio Echo Sounding (RES) surveys conducted in May 2010 and April 2011 revealed a 2 km(2) flat area with increased bed reflectivity at the base of Isunnguata Sermia at the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This flat reflector was located within a localized subglacial hydraulic potential (hydropotential) minimum, as part of a complex and elongated trough system. By analogy with comparable features in Antarctica, the initial interpretation of such a feature was a potential subglacial lake. In September 2013 a co-located seismic survey revealed a 1,750 m by 540 and 37 m thick stratified lens-shaped bedform at the base of a subglacial trough system. Amplitude Versus Angle (AVA) analysis yields a derived reflection coefficient R = 0.09 +/- 0.14 indicative of consolidated sediments possibly overlain by dilatant till. The bed and flank on the northern side of the trough consist of unconsolidated, possibly water-bearing sediments with R = -0.10 +/- 0.08, whereas on the southern side it consists of more consolidated material. We interpret the trough as a key component of the wider subglacial drainage network, for which the sediments on its northern side act as a localized water-storage reservoir. Given the observation of seasonally forming and rapidly draining supraglacial meltwater lakes in this area, we interpret the lens-shaped bedform as deposited by episodically ponding meltwater within the subglacial trough system. Our results highlight the importance of transient subglacial hydrological and sedimentological processes such as drainage events for the interaction of ice sheets and their substrates, to understand ice dynamics in a warming climate. Plain Language Summary A ground based radar survey in West Greenland showed an unusually flat, highly reflective zone in an otherwise rough bed suggesting a possible subglacial lake beneath the ice. The highly reflective zone was part of a drainage system transporting meltwater under the ice sheet. We performed a detailed seismic survey across the area which, unlike radar signals, has the advantage of penetrating through the overlying ice into any rock, sediments and water below it. Analysis of our reflection data reveal that the flat area was in fact an elongated lens-shaped bedform consisting of layered (stratified) sediments. However at a larger angle of incidence, analysis showed the bedform is possibly overlain by a thin layer of water-bearing sediments likely saturated by ponding water. Our interpretation is that episodically draining meltwater from upstream is locally accumulating beneath the ice sheet at this locality, thereby depositing the lens-shaped bedform over many melt seasons.

Model dimensionality (0D, 1D, 2D, or 3D) requires different simplification levels of physical-biogeochemical processes, computational power and calibration strategies and metrics against observations. To investigate these modelling considerations, the 1D (vertical) Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics - General Lake Model and the 3D Aquatic Ecosystem Model were applied to western Lake Erie in 2008 and 2011-14. The performance of the models was evaluated by comparing the simulations against observations of water temperature, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, nitrate, total chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria at three stations located along a transect from the Maumee River mouth to mid-basin, as well as to the basin-averaged cyanobacteria index. The 3D model showed better skill in qualitatively reproducing seasonal and spatial variations of nutrients and phytoplankton and had lower average root-mean-square error, especially through the algal plume near the Maumee River mouth. However, the horizontally averaged 1D model performed better in qualitatively capturing the cyanobacteria bloom years, as this model was extensively calibrated to basin-average values. We conclude that models should be selected and calibrated to provide the required decision support information, rather than the highest resolution or lowest error metrics at discrete sites.					王, 齐/GQQ-5976-2022														1463-4988	1539-4077				OCT-DEC	2023	26	4					76	86		10.14321/aehm.026.04.76	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.76													WOS:001252265200007

Richness, breeding environments and calling activity of the anurofauna of the lower moa river forest, state of Acre, Brazil	ZOOLOGIA												In state of Acre, most anuran research has been carried out in areas of terra firme, whereas alluvial forests remain relatively unexplored. We document the richness, breeding environments and calling season of the anurans of the Lower Moa River in the Alto Jurua (state of Acre), a region considered to harbor high biodiversity. Sampling was conducted in two main areas with different forest typologies (Terra firme forest and Alluvial forest), totaling 256 ha. The diversity of anurans was analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener index, evenness and Berger Parker dominance. The anurans were sampled from October 2008 to September 2009, using the following sampling methods: sampling at breeding sites, pitfall traps, time constrained visual search during the day (TCVSD); at night (NVTCS) and active search (AS). Fifty anuran species, belonging to eight families, were recorded: Aromobatidae (2), Bufonidae (5), Hemiphractidae (1), Hylidae (25), Leptodactylidae (9), Microhylidae (4), Ranidae (1) and Craugastoridae (3). Pitfall traps totaling 1440 day-buckets in the year. DVTCS had a total sampling effort 72 hours/person/year; NVTCS 72 hours/person/year and AS 24 hours/person/year. Greater richness (35 species) was recorded in the alluvial forest, low diversity index and high dominance (H' = 1.69, J' = 0.51, d = 0.62). Most likely, these values were influenced by the high relative abundance of Rhinella margaritifera in this area. The richness of the alluvial forest may be associated with environmental heterogeneity according with the theory of intermediate disturbances. The breeding activity of most species occurred in lentic environments (lakes and temporary ponds) and during the rainy season. When sampling anurans in the Amazon it is important to use two or more sampling method and to consider the different forest typologies of this biome for a better characterization of its richness.

J	Tasselli, S; Rogora, M; Orrú, A; Guzzella, L				Tasselli, Stefano; Rogora, Michela; Orru, Arianna; Guzzella, Licia			Behaviour of synthetic musk fragrances in freshwaters: occurrence, relations with environmental parameters, and preliminary risk assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The aims of this study were to investigate the presence, possible sources, and potential ecological risks of synthetic musk fragrances in freshwaters and sediments of the main tributaries of a deep subalpine lake in Northern Italy. The total musk concentrations ranged from few ng L-1 up to values > 500 ng L-1, depending on river characteristics: water flow and the presence of wastewater effluents proved to be the main factors affecting fragrance concentrations. The water flow may indeed dilute fragrance input mainly deriving from treated wastewaters. Good correlations (determination coefficients > 0.60) between synthetic fragrances concentrations and parameters related to anthropogenic impacts confirmed this hypothesis: synthetic fragrances were mainly detected in most polluted rivers crossing urbanized areas. Sediment analysis highlighted accumulation of fragrances in this matrix. Concentrations of synthetic fragrances up to 329 ng g(-1) organic carbon were measured in sediments of the most contaminated rivers Boesio and Bardello, which also show the highest nutrient content. The preliminary environmental risk assessment revealed that present levels of synthetic musk fragrances do not pose any risk to the studied environmental compartments. However, a probable medium risk level was evidenced during the dry season in the most contaminated rivers Boesio and Bardello. For these reasons, small rivers draining urbanized watersheds and affected by wastewater effluents should be considered synthetic musk contamination hotspots that warrant further research.

J	Wang, Y; Wang, GX; Sun, XY; Li, JL; Song, CL				Wang, Ying; Wang, Genxu; Sun, Xiangyang; Li, Jinlong; Song, Chunlin			Spatiotemporal variability of organic carbon in streams and rivers of the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The earth's cryosphere is the outpost of climatic warming, which leads to rapid changes of organic carbon (OC) transport from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. OC in the cryosphere rivers plays vital roles in the carbon cycle and river ecosystem health. Yet, we still lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of riverine OC across the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere. Here, we compiled OC concentration, radiocarbon (C-14), and the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of dissolved OC (DOC) at 254 nm data from 1007 unique sites, extracted from 138 published literature between 1972 and 2022. Overall, the average DOC and particulate OC (POC) concentrations are 6.34 and 2.61 mg C L-1, respectively, with the average age of DOC and POC being similar to 1100 and similar to 4300 years BP, respectively, indicating the release of aged carbon pools. Seasonal variations in DOC and POC concentrations, Delta C-14-DOC and SUVA(254) were observed, with distinct spatial variations closely linked to specific watershed characteristics. We found permafrost-impacted watersheds displayed significantly higher DOC concentrations, younger OC ages but lower POC concentrations compared to glacier-impacted watersheds. Meanwhile, in boreal forest watersheds, DOC is the most concentrated and youngest in varied ecoregions. Additionally, in permafrost regions characterized by higher permafrost extent, ground ice content, or lowlands with thick overburden cover, riverine DOC is more concentrated and aromatic. We estimated that specific OC fluxes in glacier rivers are higher than that in permafrost rivers (4.77 and 1.86 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Our results highlight the complex and variable spatiotemporal patterns of riverine OC in the northern cryosphere, which are essential for assessing the impact of OC on the global carbon cycle and climate warming.					; Song, Chunlin/AGU-3084-2022; Wang, Ying/HJI-2509-2023; Li, Jin-Long/S-4288-2016	Li, Jinlong/0000-0003-0509-8118; Wang, Genxu/0000-0002-3403-0983													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 1	2024	906								167370	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167370		SEP 2023						37758149					WOS:001159349400001
J	Coutant, CC				Coutant, CC			A riparian habitat hypothesis for successful reproduction of white sturgeon	REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE												White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) has recruitment failure or severe interannual variability in much of its range. Exceptions are Columbia River below Bonneville Dam, Snake River below Hells Canyon Dam, lower Fraser River, and Sacramento River. Since rivers were impounded or flows regulated, once-continuous populations now isolated by natural barriers or dams often have not reproduced successfully, despite successful spawning events. Research has not adequately explained recruitment failures or why certain populations are successful. This paper proposes that submerged riparian habitat during seasonal high water is needed for early development. Where recruitment is successful, channels are complex and floodable riparian vegetation or rocky substrate is abundant. There, spawning occurs in turbulent zones Upstream (1-5 km) of seasonally submerged riparian habitat, eggs can disperse into inundated habitat and adhere to newly wetted surfaces for incubation, yolk-sac larvae can move to riparian crevices for prefeeding development, feeding larvae have food-rich flooded habitat for early growth, and larvae can transition to juveniles as water recedes to permanent channels. Such habitat is lacking where recruitment is low and present only in high-flow years where recruitment is sporadic. These observations suggest that management should rehabilitate riparian zones and provide high river flows during spawning to stimulate natural recruitment.																			1064-1262	1547-6553					2004	12	1					23	73		10.1080/10641260490273023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10641260490273023													WOS:000189354600002

Meiobenthos showed a stable annual and seasonal pattern with oligochaetes contributing most to benthic biomass and nematodes to benthic abundance. With 152 nematode species, Lake Obersee is the most nematode species-rich lentic habitat described so far. The nematode community was dominated by the family Monhysteridae. Bacterial feeders were the most abundant feeding type; omnivorous nematodes contributed most to total nematode biomass. Reproduction occurred throughout the year, with most species reproducing parthenogenetically. No seasonal pattern in reproductive strategies was found.

The study was conducted between April 2013 and October 2013. After obtaining a blood sample from each catfish has been hematologically analyzed. Then, the water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, calcium, magnesium and nitrate values were determined at before breeding (April), breeding period (June - July) and after breeding of fish (October) and the impacts of these data on hematological values were investigated. According to this study, it was observed that the hematological values obtained at before breeding period, breeding and after the breeding period were affected by the water quality parameters.

The radiocarbon dating results of different organic components were compared with the varve-based sediment chronologies. The deviation between the Lake Valkiajarvi varve chronology (8400 varve years 2-3% error estimate) and 33 C-14 dates taken from insoluble and soluble organic phases vary inconsistently throughout the Holocene. In extreme cases mean calibrated radiocarbon dates with 95.4% confidence levels (2 sigma) are -2350 and +2040 years offset when compared with the varve chronology. On average, the radiocarbon dates are offset by ca. +550 years. The deviation between the Lake Nautajarvi varve chronology (9898 varve years +/- 1% error estimate) and 26 C-14 dates analyzed with conventional and AMS methods indicates that radiocarbon dates are systematically older by 500-1300 years (about 900 years on average). This significant offset mean that radiocarbon dates obtained from organic bulk sediment of meromictic and seasonally hypoxic lakes must be cautiously interpreted because of the reservoir effect and carbon cycling at the sediment-water interface. Direct evidence was obtained from the dating of soluble fraction and insoluble organic matter from near bottom water in the monimolimnion of Lake Valkiajarvi, which yielded C-14 ages of 560 +/- 80 BP and 2070 +/- 140 BP, respectively. Our study reinforces previous results that age-depth models based on bulk sediment radiocarbon dates obtained on sediments of stratified lakes are of limited value for accurate dating of changes in land use and especially the commence of agriculture.																			0367-5211	1799-4632					2019	91		2				221	235		10.17741/bgsf/91.2.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.17741/bgsf/91.2.004													WOS:000500959200004

Variables related to the general characteristics of water quality, trophic level, and ecological risk were assessed through the National Sanitation Foundation-Brown Water Quality Index (WQI(NSF-BROWN)), the Carlson Trophic State Index (TSICARLSON) and the Hakanson Ecological Risk Index (RIH angstrom KANSON). Using data from physical, chemical, and biological parameters obtained from four sampling points in the ALMD, the water quality was assessed in each model used. The results indicated that the reservoir presents a water quality classified as "medium" (WQI(NSF-BROWN) = 70), where significant variations in the concentrations of some parameters are observed. The reservoir showed a general trophic state (TSIGENERAL-AVERAGE = 43.04) classified as "mesotrophic". The ecological risk analysis achieved the best classification of the methodology, discarding contamination by heavy metals in surface waters. This type of applied methodology will help in decision-making tools in the dam, and can be applied in other dams in the region.					; Bustos-Terrones, Yaneth/N-9348-2016; Rangel-Peraza, Jesus/B-5445-2018	Quevedo-Castro, Alberto/0000-0001-8895-544X; Bustos-Terrones, Yaneth/0000-0001-6445-2071; 													2076-3298					JAN	2019	6	1							7	10.3390/environments6010007	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments6010007													WOS:000457196600001

Microcystins (MCs) are the most common toxin and are considered to be one of the most hazardous groups. The increasing occurrence and detection of MCs in recreation or drinking water sources pose a variety of challenges to water treatment. To ensure the safety of drinking water supplies, a variety of physical, chemical and biological processes, such as coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, disinfection, adsorption, and biodegradation have been applied for removal of MCs. It is important to determine which type of MCs is present and whether the toxins reside within the cell or as extracellular to optimize treatment approaches. Conventional treatments using coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration are effective for removing cyanobacteria intact cells. However, these methods are faced with the release of dissolved toxins as well as the requirement of regular backwashing. Dissolved MCs have been shown to be effectively removed by some techniques such as activated carbon adsorption or biological degradation. However, factors affecting the removal such as acclimation periods, biofilm composition, temperature, and water quality cannot be easily controlled. This chapter provides an overview of the current knowledge of MCs including occurrence, distribution, as well as current methods of their removal from drinking water.

However, there is a lack of research on the combined effect of these two factors. To explore these differences, we studied zooplankton populations as well as environ-mental and geographical data from different seasons in rivers with variable flows in the Shaying River basin. According to our results, the assembly mechanisms for intermittent river (IR) communities fluctuated more and were more responsive to geographical factors than were the assembly mechanisms of perennial river (PR) communities during the wet and dry seasons. We discovered that the rotifer/protozoan assemblage was more vulnerable to spatial influences, whereas the composition of the crustacean group was heavily impacted by the environment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of metacommunity assembly mechanisms in highly dynamic ecosystems.

Spatio-Temporal Variability and Pollution Assessment of Selected Metals in Freshwater Sediments, Pakistan	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												This study, describes the temporal and spatial variability of selected metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) and their origins in surface sediments collected from ten sites of Mangla Dam, Pakistan, during pre- and post-monsoon seasons. The metal contents were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF), and geoaccumulation index were calculated for the assessment of sediment pollution. Among the metals, Cd, Co, Pb, and Zn revealed higher CF values in the sediments from sites S7-S10 where the PLI also indicated heavy pollution. The EFs for Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, and Zn were >10, suggesting major anthropogenic contributions. In comparison with sediment quality guidelines, the measured concentrations of Cd, Ni, and Pb showed a probability of frequent adverse effects on sediment dwelling biota. Cluster analysis indicated that Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, and Zn were mostly contributed by human activities. The results of this study would drive urgent attention to develop preventive actions and remediation processes to stop the degradation to improve the quality of the reservoir.

Five factors, including flow disturbance, temperature, light intensity, nutrient concentration, and biological inhibition, are embedded in the equation, which results in a high-dimensional problem. The projection pursuit principle was applied for dimension reduction to resolve the numerical problem, and an integrated hydro-environmental model was established. Jinshan Lake, a typical riverside lake, was selected as the research area, and six bloom grades were determined for warning analysis. Based on the established model, the processes of Microcystis growth under varied hydrodynamic conditions were simulated. It was found that the established warning model could well reveal the Microcystis bloom processes in Jinshan Lake. The low-water year was characterized by the largest number of days on which Microcystis bloom might occur for its poor water exchange frequency; The areas where Microcystis bloom might occur in the flood seasons of high-water year, common-water year, and low-water year varied with the uneven-distributed dynamic conditions, which were respectively 0.15, 0.91, and 1.26 km(2).

However, the performance of different ammonia oxidizers in high-elevation rivers is poorly documented. Activity, abundance, diversity, and community composition of ammonia oxidizers in the Lhasa River were investigated. Unamended nitrification rates (UNRs) greatly changed and showed remarkable seasonality and were significantly correlated with solar radiation, dissolved oxygen (DO), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N). AOB abundance and solar radiation had the strongest direct and indirect effects on UNR. Comammox amoA gene abundance exceeded that of AOA and AOB in 96% of the samples. Most comammox sequences were grouped into clade B, and dominant comammox species were strongly affected by latitude, water NH4+-N, and total organic carbon. Temperature and total suspended solids were key factors explaining the dominance of the AOA species. Nitrosospira and Nitrosovibrio clusters were found in large proportions in the AOB communities. The co-occurrence pattern of ammonia oxidizers in the Lhasa River was mainly attributed to interspecific symbiosis, even though more modules were found in AOB communities. This provides a comprehensive understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of ammonia oxidizers and their roles in the nitrogen cycle of plateau rivers under global climate warming.					; pan, yongtai/GXW-2645-2022	Liu, Wenzhi/0000-0002-7149-9529; Pan, Yongtai/0000-0001-6993-2402; Ma, Lin/0000-0002-9857-5253														2690-0637				SEP 22	2023	3	10					3357	3368		10.1021/acsestwater.3c00320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.3c00320		SEP 2023											WOS:001071405700001
J	Leech, DM; Williamson, CE; Moeller, RE; Hargreaves, BR				Leech, DM; Williamson, CE; Moeller, RE; Hargreaves, BR			Effects of ultraviolet radiation on the seasonal vertical distribution of zooplankton: a database analysis	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Recently, small-scale field experiments have demonstrated that exposure to UV radiation can invoke downward migrations in UV-sensitive zooplankton; however, questions remain as to zooplankton responses at the whole-lake scale. Here a three-year database on three lakes of varying UV transparency was used to examine the relationship between UV exposure and the seasonal vertical distribution and abundance of several zooplankton species. We hypothesized that if UV radiation is an important ecological force influencing the vertical distribution and seasonal abundance of zooplankton, the strength of a given species' response to UV would be inversely proportional to its UV tolerance. UV habitat did have a significant effect on zooplankton distribution in taxa with low UV tolerance compared to taxa with high UV tolerance. Cladocerans, which are the least UV-tolerant of three major groups, tended to avoid the surface waters of the highest UV lake during periods of high UV. More UV-tolerant groups, rotifers and copepods, showed little or no evidence for avoidance of high UV habitats. Among lakes, the relationship between UV avoidance and taxon was evident only in the highest UV lake. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that UV influences zooplankton community dynamics in low DOC, UV-transparent lakes.

Characterization of Titan's Ontario Lacus region from Cassini/VIMS observations	ICARUS												Liquid hydrocarbons were long predicted on Titan's surface before the RADAR instrument onboard Cassini detected lakes poleward of 70 degrees N in July 2006. Before that the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) observed a lake-like feature in the South Pole, named Ontario Lacus, in July 2004. Here we analyze one observation of Ontario Lacus taken by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on 2007 December 5, during the T 38 flyby. This is the best spatially resolved image of a Titan lake to date by an imaging spectrometer, and has been previously reported in Brown et al. (Brown, R.H., Soderblom, L.A., Soderblom, J.M., Clark, R.N., Jaumann, R., Barnes, J.W., Sotin, C., Buratti, B., Baines, K.H., Nicholson, P.D. [2008]. Nature 454, 607-610) and in Barnes et al. (Barnes, J.W. et al. [2009]. Icarus 201, 217-225). The observing geometry and our data processing will be explained, followed by a discussion of the main characteristics of the image. The analyzed image covers a small portion of Ontario Lacus and shows what appears from RADAR data to be a region of modest slope ("ramp") adjacent to the dark lake itself. Our analysis of 5.0 mu m spectral data suggests that the previously reported absorption feature of ethane seen at shorter wavelengths may be produced by damp sediments adjacent to the main liquid basin. The latter appears to be absorbing all of the photons incident upon it in the 5 mu m spectral region and shows no discernible absorption features. A characterization of the basin composition and morphology is developed with the help of ISS and RADAR observations. The simplest model consistent with the data is an optically deep lake surrounded by a region in which ethane, propane, possibly methane, and other, less volatile hydrocarbons and nitriles are present mixed into spectroscopically neutral sediments. The dominance of relatively low vapor pressure organics outside the lake itself suggests a retreat of Ontario Lacus associated with evaporation on seasonal or longer timescales, consistent with analysis of RADAR and ISS images.

The impact of an invasive species is strong under favourable conditions. However, suboptimal feeding conditions may significantly reduce the impact to ambient environment. The invasive bivalve Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) is able to colonize both fresh and brackish waterbodies. In an in situ experiment the seasonal variability in the biodeposition of D. polymorpha from fresh and brackish water populations was quantified at different temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a (Chl a) regimes. Salinity fluctuations in brackish water areas, temperature and water Chl a content were all important factors in the model of mussels' feeding. The results indicated that D. polymorpha fed significantly more in fresh than in brackish water. Mussels acclimated more easily to acute transfer from brackish to freshwater than vice versa. The biodeposition of zebra mussels increased with temperature and water Chl a content but these effects were less straightforward than that of salinity. The results suggest that the impact of D. polymorpha on recipient ecosystem is more pronounced in fresh than in brackish water environments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As all communities try to get adapted to the challenges of their local climate, they are today sensitive to its variations. Third World countries, particularly Africa are threatened by the predicted effects of climate change because of their economic dependence on climate for development whose backbone is agriculture. There is strong evidence from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) that the observed increases in greenhouse gases particularly Carbon dioxide (CO2) may lead to global warming, sea level rise and space-time changes in climatic zones and seasons on the globe. To come up with climate change associated impacts on agriculture in Africa, the study evaluated climate related researches conducted on snow capped mountains in Africa (Mt Kilimanjaro), fishing in inland lakes (Lake Victoria, Baringo), Agriculture in the Semi-arid lands of East Africa and irrigation projects in Africa (Gezira in Egypt) It was established that Africa is already experiencing the devastating impacts of climate change as seen in frequent floods and droughts and shift in marginal agricultural systems. If the predicted temperature increase of 4.5 degrees centigrade is realized by the year 2030, then agricultural systems in Africa will be seriously affected particularly the food security section. There will be reduced land for agriculture because the high agricultural potential areas will become arid, Coastal areas will be submerged, affecting fishing and human settlement, there will be increased desertification and disappearance of ice and snow on the mountains. The effects of climate change may include: reduced agricultural land use due to submergence of coastal regions and increased aridity in the tropical high agricultural potential regions, there will be increased incidences of farm pests and diseases, over cultivation, food insecurity and poverty especially in Tropical regions. Africa will face serious challenges in her endeavor to adapt to new mechanisms of food production for sustainable development.																			1992-2248					JUL	2007	2	7					238	243																WOS:000259872600004
J	Yamanaka, T; Shimizu, R				Yamanaka, Tsutomu; Shimizu, Ryosuke			Spatial distribution of deuterium in atmospheric water vapor: Diagnosing sources and the mixing of atmospheric moisture	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We measured the stable isotopic composition of hydrogen (delta D) within atmospheric water vapor collected simultaneously at six sites in the vicinity of a lake (Lake Kasumigaura, Eastern Japan) to determine its spatial distribution characteristics and thereby diagnose sources and mixing of atmospheric moisture. The measured spatial distribution of delta D showed no relation to distance from the lake, although it showed a correlation with the distribution of the water-vapor mixing ratio Q. For two of the three sampling days, we found a simple two-component (i.e., water vapor transpiring from local land surfaces and preexisting vapor in the background atmosphere) mixing line in a Keeling plot (i.e., delta - 1/Q diagram). On a third day, however, contributions from lake evaporation were detected in addition to the above components. On this day, lake-derived vapor accounted for approximately 10-20% of atmospheric water vapor at the sites located leeward of the lake. The observed differences in mixing patterns among sampling days can be explained by a simple atmospheric moisture budget. Thus, it is likely that simultaneous isotopic measurements of atmospheric water vapor at multiple locations with aid of Keeling plot are capable of giving us useful information in diagnosing the sources and mixing pattern of the vapor.

Phytoplankton nutrient status in Lake Erie in 1997	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Reduction of phosphorus (P) inputs to Lake Erie since the 1970s have resulted in lower mean total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the lake and lower mean chlorophyll a concentration. In this study we examine indicators of phytoplankton nutritional status to determine whether the observed decrease in TP concentration has resulted in a strongly P deficient phytoplankton community. Phytoplankton nutrient status measurements including alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), P and nitrogen (N) debt, PO4 turnover time and particulate carbon (C), N and P stoichiometric ratios, were made in all three basins of Lake Erie from May through October in 1997. The phytoplankton in the western basin only infrequently showed signs of nutrient deficiency over the May through October sampling season. Phytoplankton in the large central basin were moderately P deficient during the stratified season except for a period of strong deficiency in July, the time of maximum heat content and strong stratification. The eastern basin became moderately P deficient with the onset of stratification and remained moderately P deficient over the entire stratified season and no indications of extreme deficiency were observed. Compared to several other lakes in the same geoclimatic region as Lake Erie, including Lake Superior, the phytoplankton community was not strongly nutrient deficient.					; Smith, Ralph/F-3655-2010	Taylor, William/0000-0001-8555-945X; 													0380-1330						2005	31			2			72	88		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70306-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70306-3													WOS:000238618700007

Markedly lower delta C-13 values were reported in Chironomus plumosus (-51.2 aEuro degrees) and Tanypus sp. (-43.5 aEuro degrees) than those in photoautotrophic carbon sources [particulate organic matter (POM) and sediment]. There were positive correlations between delta C-13 and delta N-15 in the two chironomid species. These results indicated that they assimilated carbon derived from biogenic methane by exploiting methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). In contrast, Propsilocerus akamusi exhibited similar delta C-13 values to those of POM or sediment. A delta C-13-based isotope mixing model was used to estimate the dietary contributions of MOB to each chironomid species. The mean contributions ranged from 11 to 15 % in C. plumosus, 13 to 19 % in Tanypus sp., but only up to 5 % in P. akamusi. In an aquarium, we observed that individuals of C. plumosus and Tanypus sp., which exhibited low delta C-13 values, built U-shaped larval tubes in the sediment, and an oxidized layer developed around these tubes. Propsilocerus akamusi did not exhibit this behavior. These results suggest that tube building may provide larval chironomids with greater access to methane-derived carbon through increased opportunities to feed on MOB.

Validation shows that the AOGCM captures spatio- temporal patterns of sea surface temperature anomalies as well as the seasonal phase- locking feature of the IOZM. The period 1820 - 1880 exhibits a high frequency of climatically significant IOZM events, compared to a relatively low frequency in the 20th century. This shift in frequency provides a climate dynamics background for the interpretation of proxy data from East Africa, a region subjected to anomalously strong October - December precipitation during IOZM events. In the late 19th century, East African lakes had highstands ( e. g., Lake Victoria) and its glaciers stable extents ( e. g., Kilimanjaro), consistent with a wetter climate due to the higher frequency of IOZM events.

J	Martin, AR; da Silva, VMF				Martin, AR; da Silva, VMF			Number, seasonal movements, and residency characteristics of river dolphins in an Amazonian floodplain lake system	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The size and structure of a community of Amazon river dolphins or botos, Inia geoffrensis (de Blainville, 1817), was investigated using boat surveys and long-term observations of recognisable animals. Year-round, some 260 botos occurred in or near the 225-km(2) Mamiraua varzea floodplain lake system, of which half were permanent residents by our definition. Seasonal variation in water levels influenced distribution between habitats but not the overall number of botos. Ninety percent of marked botos encountered within the lake system were permanent residents. There appeared to be a cline in site fidelity between those that always live in or near the system and those that visit at intervals of years. We estimated that 270 botos were "significant users" of the lake system (i.e., occurred within it for sufficient periods in a year to be observed at least once) and that many others visited for short periods. Individuals moved many tens to hundreds of kilometres along the rivers, but there was no broad-scale seasonal migration. The boto population of the central Amazon, at least, may be structured on the basis of floodplain lake systems, with extensive animal movement between systems. We estimate that 13 000 botos occur in the 11240 km(2) Mamirauna Sustainable Development Reserve, which covers an estimated 11%-18% of varzea habitat in Brazil.																			0008-4301					AUG	2004	82	8					1307	1315		10.1139/Z04-109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z04-109													WOS:000225692100016

Seasonal variation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations in urban streams at Niteroi City, RJ, Brazil	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in water samples collected in two streams and a lake located at Niteroi City, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil between October 2008 and September 2009. Samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The limits of quantification were sufficiently low to accomplish PAH determination below the maximum concentration levels established by the Brazilian (50 ng/L) and USEPA legislations, with recoveries larger than 81.6%. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene and benz[a]anthracene predominated among PAHs. Total concentrations of PAHs were well correlated with rainfall indicating a possible role of runoff to local pollution of water by PAHs and showed a seasonal variation in wet and dry seasons. Our results highlight the contribution of the widespread streams located around Guanabara Bay to the PAH burden found in its waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the scope of this study, 38 samples were taken from the water of 24 wells, 4 dams, 9 ponds and 1 source water. In order to use the data more effectively, irrigation water quality index map of Aksaray region including the results of the samples (EC, SAR, B, Cl-, NO3-, HCO3- and pH) was prepared by using Geographic Information System (GIS). According to irrigation water quality index map, all surface water sources were found to be suitable for irrigation with high and medium irrigation water quality index. EC, SAR, Cl, HCO3 values were found as high in Acipinar well and Aratol well regions whereas EC and Cl values were high in Taspinar well region. It was determined that underground water sources have low irrigation water quality index value along in the range of Taspinar region and Tuz Lake whereas they have generally medium irrigation water quality index value. The soil being heavy-texture and salty structure in the region and the level of ground water being high were caused by lack of adequate drainage system. For this reason, good and adequate drainage system should be configured in order to provide no increase in salt accumulation in the soil, to get an opportunity for more appropriate land use and to increase the yield per unit area.					; KALIPCI, Erkan/AAH-1503-2021; Karadavut, Sedat/M-2841-2019; Delibaş, Lokman/ABA-9322-2020	Delibas, Lokman/0000-0002-5744-840X; 													1842-4090	1844-489X				MAY	2012	7	2					171	182																WOS:000301998000017

Conventional methods of deriving MOI lack fine resolution needed to discriminate minor clones. This study used amplicon sequencing (AmpliSeq) of P. falciparum msp1 (Pfmsp1) to measure spatial and temporal genetic diversity of P. falciparum. Methods 264 P. falciparum positive blood samples collected from areas of differing malaria endemicities between 2010 and 2019 were used. Pfmsp1 gene was amplified and amplicon libraries sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Sequences were aligned against a reference sequence (NC_004330.2) and clustered to detect fragment length polymorphism and amino acid variations. Results Children < 5 years had higher parasitaemia (median = 23.5 +/- 5 SD, p = 0.03) than the > 5-14 (= 25.3 +/- 5 SD), and those > 15 (= 25.1 +/- 6 SD). Of the alleles detected, 553 (54.5%) were K1, 250 (24.7%) MAD20 and 211 (20.8%) RO33 that grouped into 19 K1 allelic families (108-270 bp), 14 MAD20 (108-216 bp) and one RO33 (153 bp). AmpliSeq revealed nucleotide polymorphisms in alleles that had similar sizes, thus increasing the K1 to 104, 58 for MAD20 and 14 for RO33. By AmpliSeq, the mean MOI was 4.8 (+/- 0.78, 95% CI) for the malaria endemic Lake Victoria region, 4.4 (+/- 1.03, 95% CI) for the epidemic prone Kisii Highland and 3.4 (+/- 0.62, 95% CI) for the seasonal malaria Semi-Arid region. MOI decreased with age: 4.5 (+/- 0.76, 95% CI) for children < 5 years, compared to 3.9 (+/- 0.70, 95% CI) for ages 5 to 14 and 2.7 (+/- 0.90, 95% CI) for those > 15. Females' MOI (4.2 +/- 0.66, 95% CI) was not different from males 4.0 (+/- 0.61, 95% CI). In all regions, the number of alleles were high in the 2014-2015 period, more so in the Lake Victoria and the seasonal transmission arid regions. Conclusion These findings highlight the added advantages of AmpliSeq in haplotype discrimination and the associated improvement in unravelling complexity of P. falciparum population structure.					; Nyataya, Josphat/OHU-7456-2025	Andika, Brian/0000-0002-8575-8624; 														1475-2875				SEP 9	2023	22	1							263	10.1186/s12936-023-04700-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-023-04700-5								37689681					WOS:001066612600002

A total of 5 wetlands, 4 swamps and 1 artificial lake, were purposely selected. Avian diversity data were collected using point count method. Household surveys were undertaken to collect data on anthropogenic threats of wetlands. A total of 1,130 individuals of birds belonging to 28 families and 61 species were recorded. Species richness and diversity were higher in the wet season (51 species, H = 3.65) than the dry season (40 species, H = 3.37). The Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Index (BC) revealed the three study sites were 78.77% dissimilar in species composition (BCijk = 0.7877) with a total number of 18 shared species. Chega-Gawussi wetlands and Chonkie-Shinke wetlands have 70.89% similarity with BC Dissimilarity Index value of 0.291. The study identified that drainage for farming practices, grass overexploitation and Eucalyptus plantations were the main threats to Chonke-Shinkie wetlands, and Lake Dembi has been threatened by sedimentation from the adjacent farmlands, waste disposal from the Mizan-Aman Municipality, coffee washing plantations, whereas Chega-Gawussi wetlands were affected by grass overexploitation and deforestation. Therefore, due attention and conservation actions are required from stakeholders for the protection of these ecosystems.

J	Crait, JR; Ben-David, M				Crait, Jamie R.; Ben-David, Merav			River otters in Yellowstone Lake depend on a declining cutthroat trout population	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Introduced lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) threaten the native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) population in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. A reduction in availability of cutthroat trout may affect fish predators negatively, especially during spawning season. In this study we examined the importance of spawning cutthroat trout to a fish specialist-the North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), We measured scent-marking rates at 87 otter latrine sites on Yellowstone Lake and its tributary streams throughout the cutthroat trout spawning period and identified prey in scats collected at these sites. Based on fecal deposition rates. otters were more active on spawning streams and less active on Yellowstone Lake during the height of cutthroat trout spawning, with a return to elevated activity on the lake after spawning had ended. Cutthroat trout appeared to be the most common prey item in otter scats throughout the study, based on 5 15 samples identified to the family level and 110 samples analyzed to the species level. Overall, trout occurred in 72% and longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus) in 43% of otter feces. Suckers were more prevalent than trout in otter scats only on tributary streams, toward the end of cutthroat trout spawning. Introduced lake trout, which inhabit deep water and are largely inaccessible to otters, occurred in less than 5% of otter scats. River otters in the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem appear to be relatively restricted in their diet and are heavily dependent on cutthroat trout. Our findings sua-est that continued declines in the cutthroat trout population could negatively impact otters, potentially disrupting their role in linking aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in and around Yellowstone Lake.																			0022-2372	1545-1542				JUN	2006	87	3					485	494		10.1644/05-MAMM-A-205R1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1644/05-MAMM-A-205R1.1													WOS:000238171200009

Six boreal humic lakes situated in two adjacent drainage areas were investigated. Budgets of cell transport were constructed by using a combination of hydrological and microbiological methods. Community composition of bacterioplankton in the lakes was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA. The results show that bacterial import can have been an important factor shaping the composition of bacterioplankton communities in the lakes, despite that the lakes were sampled at low flow occasions. Consequently, there were larger similarities in the composition of bacterioplankton between lakes within the same drainage area than between lakes in different drainage areas.					; Lindström, Eva/H-5930-2016	Lindstrom, Eva/0000-0001-8920-3071; 													1015-1621					MAY	2005	67	2					210	219		10.1007/s00027-005-0769-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-005-0769-2													WOS:000229096400009

To understand lacustrine carbon and nitrogen cycling in this end-member ecosystem, and to de. ne paleolimnological proxies for ice-covered lakes, we measured the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of particulate organic matter (POM) and benthic organic matter (BOM) within the lakes of Taylor Valley. The delta(13)C compositions of seasonally ice-free edges of the lakes ( moats) are enriched relative to under-ice organic matter. Thus, the organic carbon isotopic composition of buried sediments may be a proxy for sample position within the lake. In the moats, delta(13)C values are governed by limited CO2 diffusion across benthic cyanobacterial cell membranes. During a high glacial melt ( 2001 - 2002) season, both delta(13)C(POM) and delta(13)C(BOM) in the moats were more depleted than during previous low melt years. We propose that this occurred in response to higher [CO2]((aq)) and/or reduced growth rates resulting from turbidity-induced light limitation. Though moats and under-ice environments are usually poorly connected, during the 2001 - 2002 season, the enrichment of the delta(13)C(POM) values at 6 m depth in the stream-proximal sites relative to deep-profile sites implies enhanced connectivity between these environments. The delta(13)C compositions of BOM and POM profiles in Lake Hoare and Lake Fryxell indicate that these lakes are dominated by benthic productivity. In contrast, in Lake Bonney, the similarity of the delta(13)C values of BOM and POM indicates the pelagic component dominance in the carbon cycle.

Additional stable isotope and trace element data from the gastropod Bithynia tentaculata (shells and opercula) from some intervals of these cores, as well as previous data from bulk carbonate from the lower part of the studied intervals were also considered. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca molar ratios for the Holocene lake water have been estimated from evaluations of the partitioning coefficients for Mg and Sr for C. neglecta and B. tentaculata taking into account the modern-lake water composition. This study shows an overall gentle trend to higher delta(18)O values in C. neglecta valves from the Boreal interval (mean -8.44 degrees) to the upper part of the core (mean -8.11 degrees). This trend is superimposed to higher frequency oscillations of stable isotope values and trace element ratios, especially through the upper Older Atlantic and the Subboreal. The overall isotopic oxygen trend includes several shifts in delta(18)O of about 1 degrees. These shifts are interpreted as major regional-global climate changes that have also been observed in other coeval delta(18)O and pollen records which reflect the Holocene climate variability in other European basins. Especially well-defined peaks in some episodes like Older Atlantic (similar to 8200 yr BP), Younger Atlantic - Subboreal transition (similar to 5600 yr BP) and early Subatlantic (similar to 2500 yr BP) correspond to well-recognized events in globally-distributed records. Some of these shifts are correlated with pulses in the lake-level curve of the Lake Geneva.

Lake size and depth affected phytoplankton FG distribution in both large-sized and small-sized lakes by affecting light availability which was mainly driven by the mixing events during the studied period. Although PO4-P and alkalinity were the other main environmental constraints influencing phytoplankton distribution, they were not directly affected by lake morphometry. Codon Lo was mainly found in small-sized and shallow lakes, whereas coda B, C, D, J, R, and T, which do not have active buoyancy regulation and adapt to high Zmix/Zeu conditions, occurred with high relative biovolwne in large-sized water bodies.					morkoyunlu, arzu/F-6153-2018; CANLI, OLTAN/JJE-0713-2023; TUNCA, Hatice/GOP-3221-2022; Ergül, Halim/F-5129-2018; ONGUN SEVİNDİK, Tuğba/JAN-7028-2023	Canli, Oltan/0000-0002-2652-844X; ONGUN SEVINDIK, Tugba/0000-0001-7682-0142													1863-9135					DEC	2020	194	2					125	140		10.1127/fal/2020/1338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2020/1338													WOS:000599170300005

Along with a parasitological examination, biometric information for the sample of Prussian carp was recorded. The features of philometrid adult females on their host were compared with similar studies. The size, body color, location site of attachment and seasonality of parasite occurrence were in agreement with previous reports of this nematode species. Also, a review of scientific and grey databases concerning species of Philometra Costa, 1845 and Philometroides Yamaguti, 1935 genera parasitising ichthyofauna of Romania was made. To our knowledge, after the source provided by Cojocaru (2010) this paper highlights for the second time in Romanian parasitological literature the use of scientific name Philometroides sanguineus. However, the adopted synonyms and the site of infection recorded by other authors suggest an earlier presence of this helminth species in gibel (Prussian) and crucian carps from various freshwater resources of Romania.

As a result, there are significant concerns for the changes in seasonal flow regimes which will result in degrading fisheries and biodiversity downstream. In this paper, we assess how a multipurpose dam affects downstream flows. To predict the magnitude of flow changes, flows which were simulated using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and other necessary data were computed into HEC-ResSim (Reservoir Simulation) models to simulate regulated flow from the dam. Downstream flows under three different operation scenarios (full-level, low-level, and seasonal variation) were modeled to compare with the baseline flows. For low-level and seasonal variation operation scenarios of Stung Sen dam, daily and seasonal flows saw a significant change. There would be an average increase of 42% in dry season flow and an average decrease of 46% in wet season flow, with the corresponding standard deviation of 22% and 19%, respectively, at the outlet of Stung Sen Basin, resulting from an operation to maximize energy production. The natural river flow in this river would be significantly changed due to this dam construction.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				DEC	2020	11	4					1123	1133		10.2166/wcc.2019.115	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2019.115													WOS:000599948400018

The morphology, photosynthetic activity, and anatomy of cuttings in three water conditions (-40 cm, water level 40 cm below soil surface; 0 cm, water level 0 cm at the soil surface; and 40 cm, water level 40 cm above soil surface) and two lights conditions (full sunlight and 10% sunlight) were measured. Plants had a higher survival ratio and biomass accumulation in full sunlight than in 10% sunlight when the water level was -40 and 0 cm, but there was no difference between these parameters in cuttings grown under the two light conditions in the 40 cm water treatment. In full sunlight, a lower survival ratio and reduced biomass were observed with increasing water level. The same trend was also seen for survival ratio in 10% sunlight. However, there was no difference in biomass among the three water levels in 10% sunlight, except for leaf weight. Branch height, leaf number, adventitious root length, and adventitious root number were different in the three water levels and two light conditions. In water levels of -40 and 0 cm, plants had lower chlorophyll contents in full sunlight than in 10% sunlight. In full sunlight, there was no difference in chlorophyll content between the water levels, while in 10% sunlight, lower chlorophyll content was observed in -40 cm than in 0 cm water. Photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate decreased, but water-use efficiency increased in reduced light at all three water levels. Additionally, plants had higher porosity in 40 cm water than in -40 and 0 cm conditions. Based on the reduced plant growth in the 10% sunlight condition and decreased survival in the 40 cm water level, we conclude that low light significantly decreased plant acclimation to incomplete submergence and that high water levels induced dormancy in the cuttings. Therefore, the height of cuttings used for forestation or reforestation is an important consideration for mitigating the negative effects of seasonal flooding on the survival and growth of S. triandroides in Dongting Lake wetlands.					zhang, xiaoyong/D-9539-2011														1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2017	51	2					321	330		10.1007/s10452-017-9619-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-017-9619-2													WOS:000400989500010
J	Dionne, K; Dufresne, F; Nozais, C				Dionne, Kaven; Dufresne, France; Nozais, Christian			Overlapping trophic niches among co-occurring amphipods from a cryptic species complex	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Ecological differences among species are usually associated with phenotypic differences that enable species to lessen interspecific competition. Many cryptic species co-occur in communities, thus raising the question of their ecological equivalency. In the case of freshwater amphipods from the Hyalella azteca cryptic species complex, both ecological differences and overlaps have been reported among species that co-occur in lakes. Since lakes are heterogeneous habitats that vary in space and time, it is possible that species minimise interspecific competition by occupying different trophic niches. We tested the hypothesis that amphipod species from the H.azteca complex co-occur by feeding on different food resources in the littoral zone of boreal lakes. We compared the stable isotopes ratios (C-13 and N-15) of amphipods from different species, and reconstructed their diets using mixing models. We showed that H.azteca amphipods from different species had isotopic compositions and habitat uses that greatly overlapped. Differences in isotopic composition often occurred, but they were also observed for amphipods of the same species sampled at different depths. This suggests that H.azteca amphipods fed mainly on resources that were available at the site where they occurred rather than distributed according to the occurrence of a specific resource. The overlap in diets suggests that H.azteca amphipods had overlapping trophic niches. Therefore, niche partitioning for food resources was not a process explaining the co-occurrence of these species within these lakes. Competition for food resources was not likely an important mechanism to explain H.azteca species assemblages in communities. Each H.azteca species apparently fed on food items that were abundant in the littoral zone of lakes, meaning that competition for food might be avoided most of the time. If food scarcity ever happens, the period of scarcity is probably too short to allow the exclusion of one amphipod species by competitive exclusion because of the low differences in fitness between the species, allowing Hyalella cryptic species to co-occur during the open-water season. Neutral mechanisms and ecological drift might also influence assemblage dynamics.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					1052	1062		10.1111/fwb.12924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12924													WOS:000400571200008

Functional morphology of phytoplankton in a tropical high mountain lake: Tota Lake (Boyaca-Colombia)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Functional morphology corresponds to adaptive responses to changes in the environment. In phytoplankton, traits such as the development of mucilage, oil vesicles, filaments and variation in the surface/volume ratio, allow algae to deal with sedimentation, optimizing light and nutrient uptake. The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between traits and variation in physical and chemical conditions in Tota Lake (Boyaca, Colombia). For this, ten samplings were undertaken in a monthly basis between October 2013 and July 2014. We measured water pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, alkalinity and total hardness; we also quantified Total Kjeldahl nitrogen and Total phosphorus. Algae were collected at different depths according to Secchi transparency. Taxonomic composition and abundance were estimated by the chamber sedimentation method. Morphological traits were measured for each taxa according to geometric models, allowing traits classification into morphologically based functional groups (MBFG) and having algae biomass expressed as biovolume. The variables were evaluated through Principal Components Analysis, which included time-space effect and it was interpreted according to variation in water level. Through Canonical Correspondence Analysis we established the relationship between phytoplankton biovolume accumulated in form categories and environmental variables. The ordination showed that limnological conditions are influenced by seasonal changes, which are mainly represented by oxygen saturation percentage, Secchi transparency, TKN, hardness and alkalinity. Four MBFG were found: IV, V, VI and VII, being MBFG IV and VII the most representatives. ACC was significant (Monte-Carlo Test, p<0.05). In conclusion, the morphological and functional response of phytoplankton in Tota Lake is driven by short-term variability in transparency, phosphorus, nitrogen, hardness, and electrical conductivity, which are all affected by seasonal changes in the lake level.

Exploiting the chance provided by the specific hybrid bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton (Hungary) covering the entire morphological range between the two species (including gill raker morphology), we implemented a comprehensive study (1) to reveal the feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps living in a mesotrophic, lacustrine habitat and (2) to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors and gill raker morphology affect diet composition. We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources. In conclusion, the effects of abiotic environmental factors and available food resources could overwhelm the effect of gill raker morphology in shaping the feeding habits of bigheaded carps.

To quantify microbial loads and to determine probable sources of elevated E. coli levels, water and sediment samples were collected from both beaches during swimming season 2011. Sources of fecal pollution were assessed using multiple molecular markers: human-associated Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron alpha 1-6 mannanase (B. theta), bovine-associated Bacteroides (BoBac), human adeno-viruses (HAdVs), and bovine adenoviruses (BAdVs). Fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci) were also monitored. In Singing Bridge Beach, 50% of water samples (n = 78) exceeded the recreational water quality guidelines for E. coli, while in Whites Beach all water samples met the E. coli standard. B. theta, BoBac, HAdVs, and BAdVs were detected in both beaches indicating influence of multiple sources of contamination. Cell culture assays indicated six water samples from Singing Bridge Beach and seven water samples from Whites Beach contained infectious viruses. Both frequency and concentrations of B. theta and BoBac were higher in sediment samples than in water samples. Elevated BoBac as compared with B. theta in water and sediment samples in both beaches, which are located in a watershed characterized as intensely farmed, suggest that runoff from agricultural areas was one of the probable dominant pollution sources. This study demonstrates that Bacteroides markers used in combination with land use information may help to characterize impacted beaches in mixed watersheds and design management plans.

J	Celik, K; Ongun, T				Celik, Kemal; Ongun, Tugba			Spatial and temporal dynamics of the steady-state phytoplankton assemblages in a temperate shallow hypertrophic lake (Lake Manyas, Turkey)	LIMNOLOGY												Spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and species composition in the shallow hypertrophic Lake Manyas, Turkey, were studied biweekly from January 2003 to December 2004 to determine steady-state phases in phytoplankton assemblages. Steady-state phases were defined when one, two or three coexisting species contributed to at least 80% of the standing biomass for at least 2 weeks and during that time the total biomass did not change significantly. Ten steady-state phases were identified throughout the study peiod. During those periods, Achnanthes microcephala (Kutzing) Cleve twice dominated the phytoplankton biomass alone and contributed to more than 50% of the total biomass in seven phases. Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing, Anabaena spiroides Klebahn, Cyclotella stylorum Brightwell, Pediastrum boryanum (Turpin) Meneghini and Phacus pusillus Lemmermann were also represented once in steady-state phytoplankton assemblages. A. microcephala was dominant usually during cold periods of the year, while M. aeruginosa and A. spiroides were usually dominant in warm seasons. The total number of species showed a clear decrease during steady-state phases at all stations. All stations were significantly different in terms of the measured physical and chemical parameters (P < 0.05) and phytoplankton biomass (F = 117, P < 0.05).					; ÇELİK, KEMAL/I-5815-2017; TUNCA, Hatice/GOP-3221-2022	ONGUN SEVINDIK, Tugba/0000-0001-7682-0142; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2008	9	2					115	123		10.1007/s10201-007-0233-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-007-0233-1													WOS:000257726800004

MICROBIOLOGY												The effect of carbonate concentration, pH of the medium, and illumination intensity on the major physiological characteristics (growth rate and the intensities of CO2 assimilation and oxygen photoproduction) of the natronophilic cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp. Z-M001 have been studied. It was established that the investigated microorganism has at least two transport systems (TS) for CO2, which differ in both the pH optimum and substrate affinity: TS I has a pH(opt) 9.4-9.5 and a K (S 0.5) of 13-17 mM, whereas TS II has a pH(opt) 9.9-10.2 and a K (S 0.5) of 600-800 mM. The substrate affinity of these transport systems is several orders of magnitude lower than the substrate affinity of the transport systems of freshwater cyanobacteria. It is suggested that they are unique for extremely alkaliphilic cyanobacteria and reflect their adaptation to the seasonal cycles of the lake hydrochemistry.

Results showed that the mean (min-max) metal concentrations (in micrograms per liter) in Tasik Chini waters for the 12months sampling based on 15 sampling stations (in descending order) for Fe, Al, Mn, Ba, Zn, Pb, Cu and Cd were 794.84 (309.33-1609.07), 194.53 (62.37-665.93), 29.16 (16.68-79.85), 22.07 (15.64-29.71), 5.12 (2.224-6.553), 2.36 (1.165-4.240), 0.832 (0.362-1.443) and 0.421 (0.254-0.696) respectively. Concentration for three metals i.e. Ni, Cr and Co were too low and not detected by the graphite furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). Comparison with various water quality standards showed that the mean metals concentration in surface water of Tasik Chini were low and within the range of natural background except for Fe and Al. In general, metal concentrations in Tasik Chini water varied temporally and spatially. The main factors influencing these metal concentrations in the water were the raining season and mining activities. Stations located at Tanjung Jerangking and Melai areas were the most effected due to those factors.

J	Silva, A; Quintana, L; Galeano, M; Errandonea, P				Silva, A; Quintana, L; Galeano, M; Errandonea, P			Biogeography and breeding in Gymnotiformes from Uruguay	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												This study was carried out in Uruguay (30 - 35 degreesS), South America, with two complementary approaches. First, an extensive exploration of Uruguayan freshwaters allowed us to assess the distribution of the two major species of Gymnotiformes (out of 4) across sites. Gymnotus carapo was uniformly distributed in Uruguayan territory, whereas Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus was observed in the northern and eastern part of the country. There was a highly significant negative correlation between the relative abundance of Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus and pH and water conductivity. Moreover, these environmental factors are significant contributors to its spatial differences in relative abundance. Second, temperature, conductivity, photoperiod, and the structure of a Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus population were analyzed across seasons in a small lake over a two-year period. Water temperature and photoperiod exhibited important seasonal changes, whereas water conductivity remained low and relatively constant. The presence of sexually mature males, females, and the sudden increase of juveniles indicated the occurrence of the breeding season in November, December, and January, coinciding with high mean water temperatures and extreme photoperiod. These results agree with previous data that support the hypothesis of temperature as an important environmental factor for the onset of breeding in Gymnotiformes from the temperate zone.

Different zooplankton taxa and groups showed different ranges of delta C-13 signatures, giving an insight into food sources and niche partition. In particular, cyclopoids had a restricted range with more negative delta C-13 parts per thousand values and an increase in delta C-13 fractionation with the establishment of water thermal vertical stratification, highlighting the importance of vertical distribution as a key factor for taxa coexistence in a vertically heterogenous environment. The delta C-13 values of the zooplankton community and of Daphnia were positively related to water temperature (R-2 = 0.58 p < 0.0001 and R-2 = 0.68 p < 0.0001, respectively), and the delta C-13 Daphnia signature was positively related to chlorophyll a (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.0001). Decomposition of the time-series data for zooplankton carbon and nitrogen signatures and environmental parameters identified increasing trends in water temperature, chlorophyll a and water conductivity and a decrease in nitrate that matched changes in carbon isotopic signature trends in some zooplankton taxa (Bosmina, Daphnia and Diaptomids). Overall, the observed patterns in zooplankton isotopic signatures were interpreted as integrations of the effects of climate warming in Lake Maggiore, affecting both the availability of food sources and environmental conditions.

The most crucial of them are the high-precision measurements of the main water quality parameters, such as the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and total suspended sediments (TSS) in the upper water layer, together with a high operational rate and the ability to cover a large water area in a short time, which corresponds to a satellite overpass. A possible solution is to utilize laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of water constituents measured by a marine LiDAR in situ with a high sampling rate from a high-speed vessel. This allows obtaining a large ground-truth dataset of the main water quality parameters simultaneously with the satellite overpass within the time interval determined by NASA protocols. This method was successfully applied to the oligotrophic Issyk-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan, where we obtained more than 4000 and 1000 matchups for the Chl a and TSS, respectively. New preliminary regional bio-optical models were developed on the basis of a one-day survey and tested for archive Sentinel-2A data for 2022. This approach can be applied for regular monitoring and further correction in accordance with seasonal variability. The obtained results, together with previously published similar studies for eutrophic coastal and productive inland waters, emphasize the applicability of the presented method for the development or adjustment of regional bio-optical models for water bodies of a wide trophic range.

One promising approach to reconstructing that variability is through the use of stable isotope geochemistry and sclerochronology, the study of growth banding in organisms that undergo accretionary growth. We used a combination of sclerochronology, conventional stable isotope ratios and clumped isotope paleotemperatures to improve our understanding of past seasonality and climate variability in the Turkana Basin (Kenya, Ethiopia), which experiences a highly seasonal (tropical semi-desert) climate. In this case study, we apply these approaches to both Early Pleistocene and Holocene bivalve shells (Etheria and Pseudobovaria) to develop a model using various proxies of seasonal-interannual temporal variability in lake temperature and isotope chemistry. We leverage this model to better understand how lakes in the Turkana Basin have changed over short time-scales in the past. One modern (1979) river oyster has exclusively negative delta O-18 values through similar to 1.5 yrs of growth and clumped isotope temperature reconstructions (30.1-31.5 degrees C) consistent with a river delta provenance. Late Holocene shells show a wider range of isotopic variability within each shell's growth history than the modern sample (similar to 2 parts per thousand for the modern sample vs. 5-7 parts per thousand for the Late Holocene samples) and near modern paleotemperatures, suggesting growth under both seasonal Omo flood pulse and lacustrine conditions. Middle Holocene shells exhibit less delta O-18 variability, consistent with growth in fresher Lake Turkana water at the end of the African Humid Period (12-5 ka), and with both surface water temperatures and water column temperature range similar to the Late Holocene. The Early Pleistocene shells have large seasonal delta O-18 cycles (4-7 parts per thousand), with delta O-18 values comparable to modern and Holocene deltaic shells, and a large range of paleotemperatures (21.8-31.3 degrees C, including temperatures notably cooler than those measured in the modern lake: 25-31 degrees C), reflecting growth under significant seasonality in paleo-Omo River runoff. Oxygen isotope cycles suggest high degrees of seasonality of the paleo-Omo River runoff (or that of other major influents) into paleolake Lorenyang at similar to 1.6 Ma, which may be similar to modern hydroclimate conditions. Comparison to prior datasets from nearby outcrops in the same basin suggests an increase in hydroclimate seasonality between 1.9 and 1.6 Ma. The combination of clumped isotope paleotemperature estimates from shallow water species such as E. elliptica with TEX86 measurements (derived here from previously published, contemporaneous sediment core studies from the south basin of Lake Turkana), which record temperatures near the oxycline, may provide a new approach to estimating past temperature variability along a vertical profile in lakes, thereby providing information on water column mixing regimes. Our approach greatly expands our toolkit for understanding coupled climate seasonality and variability in the Turkana Basin.					; Van Bocxlaer, Bert/N-1965-2016	Joordens, Josephine/0000-0002-5757-1168; Dettman, David/0000-0002-6001-1145; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 1	2023	317								108284	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108284		AUG 2023											WOS:001082859700001

Prey items in the guts of the icefish sampled varied significantly according to season. This finding suggests a relationship between fluctuations in available prey in the environment and selective feeding by icefish. N. taihuensis preferred large-sized zooplankton, such as Daphnia and calanoids. Additionally, the gut fullness values differed significantly (P < 0.001) among sampling times. To compare the values at different times, samples were taken over a 24 h period every 2 months for the entire year. The feeding activities of the fish were concentrated either in the morning (8:00) and/or at dusk (20:00), except in September 2010. This finding can be explained primarily by the variation in optimum light intensity. Daily N. taihuensis zooplankton consumption varied significantly, both diurnally and among seasons. The daily consumption values ranged from 0.089 to 0.237 g (wet weight) per 100 g wet fish weight in temperatures between 11.50A degrees C and 24.68A degrees C. This is the first report of diel feeding periodicity and daily food consumption of icefish in their invaded ecosystems.

Characterizing the Water Balance of the Sooke Reservoir, British Columbia over the Last Century	CLIMATE												Infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs are critical water-supply features in several regions of the world. However, ongoing population growth, increased demand and climate variability/change necessitate the better understanding of these systems, particularly in terms of their long-term trends. The Sooke Reservoir (SR) of British Columbia, Canada is one such reservoir that currently supplies water to similar to 300,000 people, and is subject to considerable inter and intra-annual climatic variations. The main objectives of this study are to better understand the characteristics of the SR through an in-depth assessment of the contemporary water balance when the basin was intensively monitored (1996-2005), to use standardized runoff to select the best timescale to compute the Standard Precipitation (SPI) and Standard Precipitation Evaporation Indices (SPEI) to estimate trends in water availability over 1919 to 2005. Estimates of runoff and evaporation were validated by comparing simulated change in storage, computed by adding inputs and subtracting outputs from the known water levels by month, to observed change in storage. Water balance closure was within +/- 11% of the monthly change in storage on average when excluding months with spill pre-2002. The highest evaporation, dry season (1998) and lowest precipitation, wet season (2000/2001) from the intensively monitored period were used to construct a worst-case scenario to determine the resilience of the SR to drought. Under such conditions, the SR could support Greater Victoria until the start of the third wet season. The SPEI and SPI computed on a three-month timescale had the highest correlation with the standardized runoff, R-2 equaled 0.93 and 0.90, respectively. A trend toward drier conditions was shown by SPEI over 1919 to 2005, while moistening over the same period was shown by SPI, although trends were small in magnitude. This study contributes a validated application of SPI and SPEI, giving more credit to their trends and estimated changes in drought.

The study area Lake 'Fuhlinger See' in Cologne ( Germany) is a complex of mesoeutrophic gravel pit lakes. The whole site is intensively used as a recreation area. Visitors are thought to be the most important single contributors to lake eutrophication. Carriers were exposed at different depths (2, 3.5, 5 m), for different time intervals (1-8 months) and from March to November PP-sheets were readily colonised by periphyton and a biofilm consisting mainly of benthic diatoms developed. Seasonal variability of periphyton on substrates was observed since filamentous green algae colonised the artificial substrates mainly between July and November. Chlorophyll a content of periphyton on the PP-fleece was up to 240-fold higher than chlorophyll a concentrations in the same volume in the epilimnion. Up to around 100 mg of total phosphorus per m 2 PP-fleece was bound and can be eliminated from the lake by removal of the substrate carriers together with the periphyton after four months of exposure. Though large-scale validations are needed, this method may be applicable as a technique to harvest phosphorus from the water column in larger-scale settings.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2004	528	1-3					123	142		10.1007/s10750-004-2337-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-2337-5													WOS:000224723600010

The reference conditions enable the determination of how impacted an ecosystem is, while the typology facilitates the implementation of management procedures. A study of subtropical reservoirs in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) was performed to obtain (1) an abiotic typology, using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (Ward's method with Euclidean distances), and (2) reference conditions for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the dry and rainy seasons for one of the established typologies. Two main statistical techniques were used: the lake population distribution approach and the trisection method. PCA identified an environmental gradient in the east-west direction, with reservoirs at higher latitudes and with larger dimensions in the west, and smaller reservoirs in eastern areas with higher altitude and higher average annual rainfall. The PCA and cluster analysis indicated that there were four main types of reservoirs. The nutrient criteria techniques, obtained for 13 type I rainy-east reservoirs, were not significantly different (t test, p < 0.05). Although the methods resulted in similar reference conditions, one-way ANOVA indicated significant differences between the seasons for Chl-a, which levels were slightly higher in the rainy season. As far as we know, this is the first study to simultaneously provide an abiotic typology and reference conditions for chlorophyll-a and nutrients in different seasons, considering subtropical reservoirs in South America. This investigation makes an important contribution to the monitoring and management of subtropical reservoirs, and the promotion of dialog between the scientific community and managers, aiming at ensuring the sustainability of water bodies.

Delayed sensory learning and development of dialect songs in brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												In captivity, male brown-headed cowbirds can develop adult song repertoires by the time they are sexually mature at approximately 1 year, as is the case for most songbirds studied to date. However, in the wild it generally takes 2 years for cowbirds to reach this stage. We have postulated that a crucial step in this protracted development involves a sensory learning phase during a male's first breeding season when he memorizes de novo many of his adult songs. To test this hypothesis, we exposed yearling cowbirds that had been housed in acoustic isolation since being taken from the wild as juveniles to different song culture environments. One cohort of yearlings was housed with adult males (tutors) from the Mammoth Lakes, California, U.S.A., dialect (Mam) where the juveniles had been trapped, while another cohort was housed with adults from an unfamiliar dialect, Santa Barbara, California, U.S.A. (SB). One year later when the tutee birds were recorded as 2-year-old adults, all 10 males in the Mam cohort had developed song repertoires typical of adults in the Mam dialect. In contrast, only 1 of 11 SB males had a single Mam song. Four of the SB cohort produced copies of their SB tutors' songs while the majority of SB tutees produced new song types that were shared exclusively by the SB tutees in 2007. The current results offer new experimental evidence to support our model for delayed vocal development in wild cowbirds based on environmental constraints that can also affect vocal ontogeny in other songbirds.

Taking water use efficiency (WUE) characterizing the coupled carbon-water cycle as the research object, and maximum and minimum temperatures as the indicators of temperature change, this study explored the response of ecosystem WUE to temperature change in Lake Victoria Basin during distinct rainy and dry seasons. The results revealed the time-lag and cumulative multiple effects of antecedent maximum and minimum temperatures on current ecosystem WUE, which marked differences between the rainy and dry seasons. The monthly average ecosystem WUE in the rainy seasons (0.99 g C kg-1 H2O) were higher than those in the dry seasons (0.83 g C kg � 1 H2O) during 2001-2018. WUE were more sensitive to temperature change in the dry seasons, with significant negative correlation with minimum temperature and positive correlation with cumulative maximum temperature. In rainy seasons, WUE showed more significant time-lag and cumulative effects, with response to maximum temperature for lagging approximate 3 months, to minimum temperature for lagging 0-2 months, to cumulative maximum temperature for lagging 1 month, and to cumulative minimum temperature lagging 3-4 months, respectively. The results add new evidence for differential non-instantaneous responses of WUE to maximum and minimum temperatures under dry and wet conditions.					zhu, wanyi/IUQ-4642-2023; Zhang, XQ/D-1648-2011														0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2023	625		B						130081	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130081		AUG 2023											WOS:001067980200001

Water temperature and other meteorological data were collected from a fixed platform in the middle of a shallow inland lake. The ITL persists year-around with its depth on the order of one m varying diurnally and seasonally and shallower during daytimes than nighttimes. Water surface heat flux derived from the ITL temperature distribution follows the diurnal cycle of solar radiation up to 300 W m(-2) during daytime and down to 50 W m(-2) during nighttime. Solar radiation attenuation in water strongly influences the ITL dynamics and water surface heat flux. Water surface heat flux simulated by two non-gradient models independent of temperature gradient, wind speed and surface roughness using the data of surface temperature and solar radiation is in close agreement with the ITL based estimates.

In Lake Mikata (Fukui, Japan) from April 2003 to January 2004, seasonal variation in the number of cells with microcystin (mcy) genotypes and the genetic diversity of the total population were investigated using quantitative competitive PCR and a 16S rDNA clone library, respectively. Using competitive PCR, cells with mcyA genotypes were quantified in August and October, and the ratio of the number of these mcyA genotypes to colony-forming Microcystis cells was 0.37 and 2.37, respectively. The 16S rDNA clones obtained could be divided into 12 ribotypes: a-l. Sixty-one Microcystis strains isolated from Lake Mikata during the sampling period were subjected to toxicity tests using HPLC and ELISA, PCR-based detection of the mcyA gene, and sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA. All isolates could be differentiated into 11 ribotypes (a, b, d, f, h, i, and m-q). Ribotypes b, f, i, m, n, and p had at least one strain that was a microcystin producer. In natural communities ribotypes b and f accounted for 85% of the 16S rDNA clones in August, and ribotypes b and i accounted for 24% of the clones in October. Thus, in some bloom stages the presence of microcystin genotypes identified using the 16S rDNA clone library correlated with that of mcy genotypes determined using competitive PCR.

These mass developments can partly be attributed to cyanobacterial toxins, such as protease inhibitors (PIs), which inhibit digestive serine proteases of Daphnia, the major herbivore of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria. To date, mechanisms of this inhibition in the gut of the crustacean Daphnia magna are not known. Here, we characterize a single serine protease, chymotrypsin 448 (CT448), which is present in the gut of the crustacean D. magna. Sequence alignments with human serine proteases revealed that CT448 has a putative N-terminal pro-peptide which is extended compared to the mammalian homologs and within this pro-peptide two N-linked glycosylation motifs were found. CT448 was heterologously expressed in Sf21 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system for optimized protein production and secretion into the medium. The protein was purified via a one-step affinity chromatography, which resulted in a protein yield of 3.45 mg/l medium. The inactive precursor (zyrnogen) could be activated by tryptic digestion. This is the first example of a recombinant expression of an active crustacean serine protease, which functions in the gut of Daphnia. Proteomic identification of protease cleavage sites (PICS) and hydrolysation of various synthetic substrates showed that CT448 is a chymotrypsin-like elastase. In this study, we confirm that CT448 is a target of cyanobacterial protease inhibitors. Local evolutionary modifications of CT448 might render this proteolytic enzyme less susceptible against cyanobacterial secondary metabolites and might improve the fitness of Daphnia during cyanobacterial blooms.

Submerged vegetation, which plays a key role in maintaining the clear water state of shallow lakes, is strongly influenced by water quality and sediment properties. In this study, we seasonally investigated the water quality, sediment properties and submerged plant communities in 18 sites in Lake Honghu of China, an internationally important wetland under the Ramsar Convention. Results indicated that most of the water quality parameters and sediment properties showed no significant difference among the three site types (i.e., perennially vegetated, seasonally vegetated and unvegetated). However, the Secchi depth in perennially and seasonally vegetated sites was significantly higher that in unvegetated sites. By contrast, season had a strong effect on most of the water quality parameters and sediment properties (e.g., water chlorophyll-a concentration). For submerged vegetation, species richness and biomass showed significant spatial but not seasonal differences, with higher richness and biomass in perennially vegetated sites. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the distribution of submerged plants was mainly determined by water NH4+ concentration and water depth.

J	Zhou, YY; Wang, XS; Han, PF				Zhou, Yanyi; Wang, Xu-Sheng; Han, Peng-Fei			Depth-Dependent Seasonal Variation of Soil Water in a Thick Vadose Zone in the Badain Jaran Desert, China	WATER												In a vadose zone the soil water content can change seasonally, driven by seasonal variations of meteorological factors. This dynamic behavior is depth-dependent, which controls the groundwater recharge from infiltration, and plays an essential role in the environments in arid and semi-arid regions. In particular, the depth-dependent seasonal variations of soil water were investigated in the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD), China, where the vadose zone is thick. The monitoring results showed that the amplitudes of temperature and soil moisture content in the shallow vadose zone (depth < 3 m) significantly decrease with depth. For the deep vadose zone (depth >3 m), the depth-dependent dynamic was synthetically estimated with both numerical and analytical models. Results show that the penetration depth of seasonal fluctuation is about 47 m, below which the infiltration flux stabilizes at a level of 30.7 +/- 4 mm/yr. The depth to water table in the BJD is generally larger than 50 m, up to 480 m. As a consequence, groundwater recharge from infiltration in this area almost does not change in different seasons.

J	Sarmaja-Korjonen, K				Sarmaja-Korjonen, K			Chydorid ephippia as indicators of environmental change - biostratigraphical evidence from two lakes in southern Finland	HOLOCENE												This study presents a new proxy method for studying past environmental change. The method is based on the relative abundance of ephippia of chydorid Cladocera (Chydoridae). Ephippia are a modification of the carapace that protects the resting eggs against, for example, freezing and desiccation. Holocene records of chydorid ephippia and other gamogenetic remains ( male headshields and postabdomens, and headshields of ephippial females) from two lakes in southern Finland (Rutikka and Kaksoislammi) are presented. Results of pollen, diatom and cladoceran analyses from Rutikka Lake are also described. Results from this study suggest that chydorid ephippia are valuable indicators of the environmental stresses occurring in lakes. In particular, ephippia were abundant at both sites during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene transition when the climate was still severe and the open-water season was short. In the later-Holocene record, the relative abundance of the ephippia also reflected the environmental stress during profound changes in predator-prey relationships in Kaksoislammi Lake. In contrast, a change in the relative abundance of ephippia of only one species (Alona affinis) occurred in the late Holocene in Rutikka Lake when prehistoric cultivation took place and affected the water chemistry.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2003	13	5					691	700		10.1191/0959683603hl655rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl655rp													WOS:000185320000006

Water turbidity affects the establishment of Neochetina eichhorniae (Warner) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): Implications for biological control of water hyacinth	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Water hyacinth is the target of nine biological control agents in South Africa including Neochetina eichhorniae (Warner) and Neochetina bruchi (Hustache) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). These two weevils have also been released against water hyacinth in Rwanda, but failed to control the weed invasion, possibly due to high turbidity in the country's water bodies. This study therefore aimed to investigate the effect of water turbidity on the establishment and performance of N. eichhorniae in Rwanda. Turbidity levels were measured over two seasons in four Rwandan rivers and two lakes. The results were then used to benchmark laboratory trials to test the effect of turbidity on the weevils' development. Water hyacinth plants were maintained at four turbidity levels: Clear water (2 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU): low (85 NTU), medium (600 NTU) and high (1500 NTU). Each treatment plant was inoculated with three N. eichhorniae larvae, while control plants were free of larvae. Plant growth was measured weekly for three months, while adult weevil emergence was recorded from the 56th day of the experiment. The number of adults emerging from the treatment plants grown in the clear water, low, medium and high turbidity levels were 24, 21, 12 and 0, respectively. Larval feeding was greater on plants growing in clear water and the low turbidity, compared to the medium and high turbidity treatments. These results indicate that N. eichhorniae may not establish or perform well in water bodies with high levels of turbidity, which in turn enhances the growth of water hyacinth, allowing compensatory growth for weevil feeding.

We examined seasonal shifts in prey use, feeding specialization, and prey electivity to determine whether a feeding bias existed toward small planktonic prey. We sampled invertebrates (from the water column and from near plant surfaces) and Eastern Mosquitofish over 4 seasons in a wetland (Cobb County, GA). Gut analysis indicated seasonal shifts from large to small prey, particularly toward cladocerans, even when larger prey remained abundant. Small planktonic prey were consumed by all sizes of Eastern Mosquitofish. Electivities for cladocerans tended to be positive, whereas electivities for other prey, and especially copepods, were negative. Prey that would be expected to aggregate at the air-water interface were consumed in much greater proportions than those sampled elsewhere in the environment, suggesting that Eastern Mosquitofish are able to consume cladocerans caught in the surface tension.																			1528-7092	1938-5412				MAR	2016	15	1					138	152		10.1656/058.015.0115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.015.0115													WOS:000378065700014

The assessment of seasonal variability in emergent macrophyte communities	BIOLOGIA												Data on seasonal variability in emergent macrophyte communities in regard to the composition of statistically significant indicator species remain incomplete. It was recognized by the authors as a potentially significant scientific issue and was defined as the main objective of this study. Information on the floristic composition of the communities included in this paper were collected in the Central Balkan Peninsula. Using a combination of cluster analysis and indicator species analysis, 11 emergent macrophyte communities were established. The seasonal dynamic of these communities did not include statistically significant modification of either the floristic composition or the species abundances according to the results of permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Nevertheless, seasonal variability in three communities - the Sparganium erectum community, Scirpus lacustris community and Typha angustifolia community - was registered in regard to the composition of their statistically significant indicator species. Disturbances primarily related to water level fluctuation in their habitats initiated a significant increase or decrease in the abundances of particular species. These slight structural changes were sufficient to induce a changeability in these communities in terms of the composition of their statistically significant indicator species over the growing season without a significant impact on the PERMANOVA results. This relatively "concealed" changeability of plant communities could have serious consequences on the processes of both defining and describing vegetation units because the indicator species are often used as "diagnostic species". Consequently, future ecological studies should be more focused on investigating seasonal variability in diverse vegetation types in order extend our knowledge in this area.

With the aim of enhancing our knowledge on cyanobacteria and their toxins in Africa, we performed a 17-month monitoring of a freshwater ecosystem, Lagoon Aghien (Ivory Coast), which is used for multiple practices by riverine populations and for drinking water production in Abidjan city. The richness and diversity of the cyanobacterial community were high and displayed few variations during the entire survey. The monthly average abundances ranged from 4.1 x 10(4) to 1.8 x 10(5) cell mL(-1), with higher abundances recorded during the dry seasons. Among the five cyanotoxin families analyzed (anatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsin, homoanatoxin, microcystins, saxitoxin), only microcystins (MC) were detected with concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.364 & mu;g L-1 in phytoplankton cells, from 32 to 1092 & mu;g fresh weight (FW) kg(-1) in fish intestines, and from 33 to 383 & mu;g FW kg(-1) in fish livers. Even if the MC concentrations in water and fish are low, usually below the thresholds defined in WHO guidelines, these data raise the issue of the relevance of these WHO guidelines for sub-Saharan Africa, where local populations are exposed throughout the year to these toxins in multiple ways.

J	Ram, A; Rokade, MA; Borole, DV; Zingde, MD				Ram, A; Rokade, MA; Borole, DV; Zingde, MD			Mercury in sediments of Ulhas estuary	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Hg levels in water, suspended particulate matter and sediment of the Ulhas estuary are under considerable environmental stress due to the indiscriminate release of effluents from a variety of industries including chlor-alkali plants. Concentration ranges of dissolved (0.04-0.61 mug l(-1)) and particulate (1.13-6.43 mug g(-1)) Hg reveal a definite enhancement of levels in the estuary. The Hg burden in sediment upstream of the weir that limits the tidal influence is low (0.08-0.19 mug g(-1)) with low C-org content (1.8-2.9%). The high Hg content of the sediment just below the weir varies seasonally (highest concentration recorded being 38.45 mug g(-1)) due to incremental accretion of sediment as the fresh water flow over the weir progressively decreases. The 30 km segment of the estuary sustains markedly high levels of Hg in the sediment with an exponential decrease in the seaward direction from the weir. Higher concentrations than the expected background prevail in all the estuarine cores up to the bottom, though the overall concentration decreases from about 20 mug g(-1) in core 7 (inner estuary) to 1 mug g(-1) in core 31 (outer estuary). The Hg in sediment is associated with C-org, while its correlation with Al, Fe and Mn is poor. The Hg profiles in cores from the Arabian Sea (stations 34, 35 and 37) have a distinct horizon of enhanced concentration in the 5-60 cm segment. Based on Pb-210 dating of core 37, the sediment at the bottom of this core is inferred to have been deposited in the year 1949, roughly two year prior to the establishment of the first chlor-alkali plant and represents the background (0.06-0.10 mug g(-1)). The Hg profiles in the offshore cores indicate a marked increase in transfer of Hg to sediment subsequent to 1980, with a peak around 1990-1992. Based on the index of geoaccumulation it is considered that the estuarine segment between stations 4 and 23 is extremely polluted, while the sediment from the open coast is moderately polluted in the top 25-30 cm with respect to Hg. The enrichment factor of Hg in the sediment is 350-700 for core 4 and decreases to 0-7 for the open-shore cores. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we present evidence from a once glacier-fed lake on southern Andoya that contests this view. Analyses of radiocarbon dated lacustrine sediments including rock magnetic parameters, grain size, organic matter, dry bulk density and visual interpretation suggest that no glacier was present in the low-lying cirque during the Younger Dryas-Allerod. The initiation of the glacial retreat commenced with the onset of the Bolling warming (similar to 14,700 yr BP) and was completed by the onset of Allerod Interstade (similar to 13,400 yr BP). The reconstructed glacier stages of the investigated cirque coincide with a cool and dry period from similar to 17,500 to 14,700 yr BP and a somewhat larger Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) advance possibly occurring between similar to 21,050 and 19,100 yr Bp.

Effects of Soil Properties and Flooding on the Mobility and Transformation of Mercury in a Temperate Riparian Wetland	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												Three fractions of mercury (mobile, semi-mobile, and non-mobile mercury) were detected in the soil of an estuarine wetland in Nansi Lake, which is on the east route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The correlations between these mercury fractions and soil properties were examined under different levels of toxicity. Furthermore, the effects of two flooding conditions (permanent flooding and seasonal flooding) on mercury mobility were analyzed. Results showed that soil pH was negatively correlated with mobile mercury, whereas semi-mobile mercury was positively correlated with total aluminum, iron, and manganese. Moreover, free alumina was positively correlated with all three fractions of mercury. Our study suggests that high contents of soil acid and free alumina might promote wetlands as "sinks" for mercury sequestration, along with low concentrations of organic matter and manganese. In addition, seasonally flooded wetland might limit the production of toxic mobile mercury more than permanently flooded wetland. Large areas of seasonally flooded wetlands in the watershed are permanently flooded by the water transfer project, which elevates the water level during the dry season. As a result, the potential toxicity of mercury may increase in the watershed during water transfer, which should gain more attention.

Spatial structure and persistence of methanogen populations in humic bog lakes	ISME JOURNAL												Patterns of diversity within methanogenic archaea in humic bog lakes are quantified over time and space to determine the roles that spatial isolation and seasonal mixing play in structuring microbial populations. The protein encoding gene mcrA is used as a molecular marker for the detection of fine-scale differences between methanogens in four dimictic bog lakes in which the water column is mixed twice a year and one meromictic lake that is permanently stratified. Although similar sequences are observed in each bog lake, each lake has its own characteristic set of persisting sequence types, indicating that methanogen populations are delimited either by low migration between the anaerobic hypolimnia or by lake-specific selection. The meromictic lake is differentiated from all other lakes and contains sequences with a higher degree of microdiversity than the dimictic lakes. By relating the structure of diversity to the depth of each bog lake, we propose the hypothesis that the deeper parts of the water column favor microdiversification of methanogens, whereas the periodically disturbed water column of shallower dimictic lakes promote genetically more diverse methanogen communities.

This suggests that physical disturbance did not create more niches and did not lead to highly variable bacterial community. The major part of the bacterial community was homogeneous, with 40% of phylotypes being ubiquitous and present in all samples. A minor part was responding to two contrasting periods - permanent ice cover and open lake. During the period of ice cover the total number of phylotypes decreased by similar to 10%, the productivity of sediment bacteria varied by 15-fold (decreased by 40% under ice) and the abundance of bacteria by up to sixfold (decreased by 20%), suggesting that community of sediment bacteria with stable species composition might be highly dynamic in numbers and activity. Phylotypes identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were close to those observed in similar environments. All sequences were closely related only to uncultured phylotypes. Proteobacteria, particularly of the Beta subgroup, were the most common identified species in Lake Vortsjarv sediment samples. A few other phylotypes, mostly those typical of anoxic sediments, were observed, but were uncommon.

REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Lake Tecocomulco, Hidalgo, is a relic of the ancient lakes of Anahuac, important for the conservation of resident and migratory birds. However, the composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates is unknown; this is an important gap in conservation as they play an important role in the food web. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in macroinvertebrate assemblages and their relationship with habitat characteristics. We carried out four monitoring campaigns covering the rainy and dry seasons. The monitoring was conducted at six study sites (four in the littoral zone and two in the middle part of the lake), environmental factors were recorded at each study site, water samples were collected for their physical and chemical analysis and aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to group study sites based on physical and chemical characteristics. Richness of taxa was analysed with rarefaction. We assessed the importance value index of each taxon (considering their frequency of occurrence and abundance). Similarity analyzes were performed between study sites and similarity of taxa with indices of Jaccard and Bray-Curtis, respectively. We performed a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between environmental factors and macroinvertebrate taxa. The PCA showed a marked seasonal variation represented by warm periods, with high values of conductivity, alkalinity, hardness, sulfates, and macronutrients (N and P) and the cold period with low values. We found a total of 26 taxa of aquatic macroinvertebrates and the highest richness was found in August. The Jaccard similarity analysis found differences between the littoral area and the limnetic zone, which differ also in the composition of macrophytes. The littoral zone had the highest taxa richness of macroinvertebrates and macrophytes, while the lowest diversity was found in the offshore zone. The CCA related physicochemical characteristics of the water body with macroinvertebrate taxa showing the influence of both physicochemical characteristics and the composition of macrophytes in the spatio-temporal patterns of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the lake. The dominance of Corixidae highlights a strong grazing activity in the lake and in turn suggests an important amount of food available for higher trophic levels. Our study shows that the macroinvertebrates of Tecocomulco Lake have spatial and seasonal variations that are related to both environmental and biotic factors with groups being dominant.

Biomass briquettes: a novel incentive for managing papyrus wetlands sustainably?	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Recent innovations in the briquetting of carbonized biomass have the potential to improve the efficacy of papyrus as a fuel source. Selective harvesting of only mature stems may prove more sustainable than experimental clear-cutting approaches to regeneration pursued in earlier studies, whilst still providing up to 90 % of available biomass. Briquettes produced from papyrus compare favourably with alternative local fuels, both in physical properties and from the perspectives of potential end-users. Papyrus wetlands at Lake Naivasha, Kenya, may have the potential to provide 1.5 x 10(9) cuboid briquettes (volume c. 90 cm(3); weight c. 25 g) from a biannual harvest, satisfying the domestic fuel requirements of > 85 % of the District's population whilst simultaneously reducing pressure on forests exploited for the production of wood charcoal.

Derek			Trophic Niche and Diet Overlap between Invasive White Perch and Resident White Bass in a Southeastern Reservoir	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The White Bass Morone chrysops is a popular sport fish that appears to be negatively affected by invasions of White Perch M. americana and often declines or disappears from invaded systems. In 2008, the first discovery of White Perch in Lake James, North Carolina, provided a rare opportunity to investigate trophic overlap between White Perch and a robust population of White Bass near the onset of invasion. We investigated the potential for resource competition between White Perch and White Bass by assessing their relative abundance (CPUE), trophic position, niche size, diet breadth, and diet overlap across 2years. White Perch were more abundant than White Bass and had wider diet breadth and trophic niche size across seasons. White Perch also occupied lower trophic positions than White Bass, indicating that White Bass maintain a more piscivorous diet. However, diet and stable isotope analysis showed a high overlap between juvenile White Bass and all sizes of White Perch. Thus, juvenile White Bass may be susceptible to competition with White Perch where resources are limited. Therefore, biologists should take steps to prevent White Perch introductions into systems with popular White Bass fisheries.

J	Imam, YE; Laval, B; Pieters, R; Lawrence, G				Imam, Yehya E.; Laval, Bernard; Pieters, Roger; Lawrence, Gregory			The strongly damped baroclinic response to wind in a multibasin reservoir	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Field data and a forced, modal-based, two-layer, variable-cross-section model (TLVC) were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in a large multibasin reservoir, Nechako Reservoir (British Columbia, Canada). The TLVC showed that most of the thermocline deflections at the dam could be accounted for by considering the first two basins upstream of the dam, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and that the thermocline deflections were dominated by the first (H1) and second (H2) horizontal baroclinic modes of the combined basins. Calibration of the TLVC against the field data showed that the H1 and H2 modes were strongly damped, with effectively no free thermocline oscillations. This strong damping had two effects: high coherence between the wind and thermocline deflections and phase lags between thermocline deflections at different locations. The damping in Nechako Reservoir is stronger than in many lakes, and results from both high velocities within the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes and drag due to submerged trees, which cover 30% of the bed. Our study provides a picture of overdamped baroclinic response and shows how useful information about the baroclinic response in complex bathymetries can be obtained using relatively simple tools such as the TLVC.					; Laval, Bernard/J-9861-2012; Imam, Yehya/H-3756-2019; Lawrence, Gregory/C-4798-2014	Imam, Yehya/0000-0001-7027-5083; Laval, Bernard Edmond/0000-0002-4810-9246													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2013	58	4					1243	1258		10.4319/lo.2013.58.4.1243	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.4.1243													WOS:000322514600009
J	Klotz, RL				Klotz, Richard Lawrence			Factors driving the metabolism of two north temperate ponds	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Two beaver ponds in central New York State, one in a forested and one in an agricultural setting, were studied to determine the influence of nutrient enrichment on metabolic activity in small, shallow north temperate lentic systems with extensive littoral zones. Metabolic activity was determined from every 15-min oxygen measurements during the growing season utilizing a sonde and wind, temperature, and depth data. The agricultural Timmerman Pond was more enriched in phosphorus and nitrogen than the forested Hoxie Gorge Pond, a factor likely driving the greater gross primary production (GPP) and more positive net ecosystem production (NEP) measured in Timmerman. Average daily GPP was over 3X greater for the more enriched pond and seasonal average NEP was positive in the enriched pond while negative for the forested pond. Daily GPP and NEP were positively correlated (P < 0.001) with daily solar radiation at both ponds. The active metabolism of small ponds, the most abundant size class of lentic systems, further confirms the important role of inland waters in the transformation of carbon on a global scale.																			0018-8158					JUL	2013	711	1					9	17		10.1007/s10750-013-1450-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1450-8													WOS:000318281200002

Update on the Effects of a Sierran Wildfire on Surface Runoff Water Quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Wildfire has been shown to increase the short-term (1-3 yr) mobilization of mineral N and P in forest ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and Lake Tahoe Basin. The ensuing effects on tributary and lake water quality are uncertain. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the impacts on runoff water quality over an intermediate time frame of 5 yr (2002-2007) after a wildfire event. Our design included fixed plots randomly placed within burned and unburned areas. Because each plot was sampled repeatedly during the study, we treated plots as repeated random effects in the analysis. We used a mixed model approach to analyze nutrient runoff concentrations and load for NH4+-N, NO3--N, and P in phosphate form (designated as ortho P or PO43--P) where treatment (unburned vs. burned), time (pre-wildfire, post-wildfire year 1, year 2, etc.), and their interaction were fixed effects. Concentrations and loads of mineral N and P were higher in runoff from the burned areas immediately after wildfire. Because high water years may also contribute to higher runoff nutrient concentrations and loading, a wildfire followed by a high water year within the first season after a wildfire would likely have a much greater impact on runoff (and hence tributary) water quality than a wildfire followed by a low runoff water year.						, Bernie/0000-0001-9032-935X													0047-2425	1537-2537				JUL-AUG	2013	42	4					1185	1195		10.2134/jeq2012.0472	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2012.0472								24216370					WOS:000321822300025

Methods: Urine samples of school children were tested for microhaematuria using reagent strips followed by microscopic examination for Schistosoma haematobium eggs. Water contact sites were also identified and sampled for snails. Results: The overall prevalence of S. haematobium eggs in school children was 4.64%. The mean intensity of infection was 1.14 +/- 0.41 eggs/10ml urine. Males had insignificantly higher prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection than females. The youngest age group (4-7 years) had no infection. The prevalence of micro-haematuria (6.2%) was higher than that of microscopy, and this correlated positively with prevalence (r=0.65, P < 0.01) and intensity (r=0.50, P < 0.01) of the infection. Potential intermediate host of human shistosome collected were: Bulinus globosus, B. senegalensis and Biomphalaria pfeifferi. However, only B. globosus shed cercariae of S. haematobium, with a snail infection rate of 0.73%. Transmission was in the dry season coinciding with the drying of wells. Conclusion: The results revealed that urinary schistosomiasis is prevalent, and that B. globosus and not B. truncatus as previously reported is the main intermediate host of urinary schistosomiasis in this part of Enugu State.																			1735-7020	2008-238X				JUL-SEP	2013	8	3					467	473											24454442					WOS:000325160800017

Angler opinion of potential bluegill regulations on Illinois lakes: Effects of angler demographics and bluegill population size structure	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus are an important sport as well as food fish, but harvest regulations do not currently exist on most lakes throughout the United States. A self-administered survey was used to provide insight into angler attitude toward potential new bluegill harvest regulations (including catch-and-release-only fishing, no-fishing zones, daily bag limits, and minimum size limits) designed to increase the number of bluegills 150 mm or larger. Angler surveys were conducted at six lakes in Illinois, three of which contained bluegill populations that were categorized as stunted (few fish greater than 150 mm) and three as quality (fish greater than 180 mm were abundant). Anglers showed greatest support for catch-and-release fishing (during the spawning season), a 6-in minimum size limit, and use of a daily bag limit of 10. Anglers showed a less positive response to 7- and 8-in minimum size limits, a 25-fish daily bag limit, catch-and-release fishing for the entire year, and no-fishing zones (one-fourth of the lake) during the spawning season. Proposed regulations receiving negative responses were no-fishing zones (one-half of the lake) for either the entire year or just during spawning season. Angler willingness to support regulations was affected by bluegill size structure as there was greater acceptance 011 stunted than on quality lakes. Importance of catching fish, distance driven to a lake, and size of hometown all influenced support for regulations. Less-experienced anglers showed greater support for regulations than more highly experienced anglers. Anglers fishing for food and sport showed less support for regulations than anglers fishing for sport alone. No differences existed in the opinion of anglers based on the species of fish they were targeting. Information on support for various regulations and identification of different angler groups will aid management decisions for bluegill populations and help guide education efforts.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2006	26	4					800	811		10.1577/M04-020.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-020.1													WOS:000243009100003

The predominant morbidity pattern of Chadian nomadic pastoralists (representing approximately 10% of the total population of the country) had not been documented so far. A total of 1092 women, men and children was examined by a physician and interviewed during two surveys in the dry season and one in the wet season (1999-2000). Participants with no complaint were rare. Pulmonary disorders (e.g. bronchitis) were most often diagnosed for children under 5 years of age. Of the adult participants, 4.6% were suspected of tuberculosis. Febrile diarrhoea occurred more often during the wet season when access to clean drinking water was precarious. Malaria was only rarely clinically diagnosed among Arabs during the dry season, whereas Fulani, who stayed in the vicinity of Lake Chad, were also affected during this period. A 24-h dietary recall showed that less Arab women than men consumed milk during the dry season (66% versus 92%). Malnutrition was only documented for 3 out of 328 children (0-14 years). Arab women in childbearing age had a higher proportion of children not surviving when compared to Fulani women (0.2 versus 0.07). This study identified several implications for reseach and interventions in nomadic settings. Innovative and integrated health services for nomads can possibly be extended to many settings as nomadic pastoralists have in common a similar way of life driven by the needs of their animals.

The recent history of hydro-geomorphological processes in the upper Hangbu river system, Anhui Province, China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper describes 20th century climate and human impacts on terrestrial and fluvial systems in the Dabie Mountains, Anhui Province, China, based on analyses of four types of information. Analyses of particle size, mineral magnetism, organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a sediment core taken from the Longhekou reservoir, built in 1958 AD in the upper reaches of Hangbu River, provide an similar to 45 year record of fluvial responses, while monitored meteorological and hydrological data provide records of climate and river discharge. Census data compiled for the local Shucheng County provide records of population and land use, complemented with analyses of satellite images.. The Xiaotian river delivers over 65% of the total water and silt to the reservoir. Analyses indicate that the fluvial regime tracks the monsoon climate over seasonal timescales, but human activities have a strongly mediating effect on sediment supply, sediment delivery and, to a lesser extent, runoff over longer timescales. Notable periods of human impact on erosion include the Great Leap Forward (1958-1960) and Great Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). A rising trend in precipitation and new land use changes at the present time may be leading to an enhanced flood risk. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	DeMott, WR; Tessier, AJ				DeMott, WR; Tessier, AJ			Stoichiometric constraints vs. algal defenses: Testing mechanisms of zooplankton food limitation	ECOLOGY												The nature of resource limitation for zooplankton grazers is strongly debated. We provide a test of stoichiometric constraints and three alternative mechanisms of resource limitation in six lakes that represent a natural gradient in resource quality. Growth assays measured the responses of juvenile Daphnia to concentrated natural resources and to supplements of phosphate (P), essential fatty acids (EFA), and P-deficient and P-rich algae. Assimilation experiments quantified the digestibility of P-32-labeled resources. Daphnia growth was much lower on resources from deep compared with shallow lakes (0.13 +/- 0.01 d(-1) and 0.30 +/- 0.03 d(-1), respectively) but was independent of resource concentration. Growth was negatively correlated with the resource C:P ratio, but the relationship was not causal as responses to the P supplement were very weak. Adding EFA also produced weak responses. In contrast, supplements of readily digested algae stimulated moderate (P-deficient) and strong (P-rich) increases in growth that accounted for growth variation among the lakes. Changes in Daphnia P balance Were also contrary to P limitation. In all, our growth assays implicate energy limitation unrelated to food concentration and, therefore, support the digestion resistance hypothesis. Digestion resistance is further supported by a positive correlation between assimilation efficiency and growth. Our results show that stoichiometric theory needs to be integrated with theory on plant and algal defenses against herbivores.																			0012-9658					DEC	2002	83	12					3426	3433		10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[3426:SCVADT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[3426:SCVADT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180318200018
J	Cargnelli, LM; Neff, BD				Cargnelli, Luca M.; Neff, Bryan D.			Condition-dependent nesting in bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												There are two prominent, nonmutually exclusive hypotheses to explain the timing of reproduction in animals: energetic constraint and adaptive behaviour. We tested these hypotheses by quantifying the costs and benefits of nesting at different times in the season for male bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, a species with paternal care, in Lake Opinicon (Ontario, Canada). The value of nesting at different times during the breeding season (RSb) was determined from spawning individuals as RSb = P-b x C-b x S-b x O-b, where P-b is the probability of spawning during each bout b, C-b is the expected brood size, S-b is the expected brood survivorship to 'swim-up', and O-b is the survivorship of free-swimming fry to age 1 year. The results show that the value of nesting peaks during the middle of the season. However, nesting patterns varied with male condition and not all males nested at the peak. Larger males, which were able to nest multiple times, first nested early in the season when overwinter survivorship of offspring and renesting opportunities later in the season were maximized. These males had the highest seasonal reproductive success. Smaller males, which nested a single time, delayed nesting until the middle of the season when spawning opportunities and brood sizes were greatest. These data suggest that both energetics and adaptive behaviour play roles in determining the timing of reproduction.

We collected data on turtle movements and home range through mark and recapture and radiotelemetry, focusing on seasonal differences between periods of high and low water levels. Based on radiotelemetry of 6 females in the Jaraua River system, linear home range varied from 16.52 to 44.5 km. Nesting migrations from the Jaraua to the beaches of the Japura River averaged 18.04 km. Males did not move significantly between captures. For conservation purposes, it is of critical importance to protect both the canals that the turtles use to travel between the lakes and the river as well as the deep holes in the river where mature turtles congregate during the dry season.

Dolly Varden in the Shiisorapuchi River in central Hokkaido, Japan, used both tributaries, of which there are many, and the main stem, but spawned only in tributaries. The size structures of Dolly Varden (>= age 1 + years) in tributaries were unimodal (< 100 mm fork length, L-F) during non-spawning seasons but changed to bimodal during spawning seasons (lower mode < 110 mm, upper mode > 120 mm L-F). Mature individuals were observed in both modal groups. From the trapping and census data, the small group appeared to be tributary resident and the large group main stem migrant. Males were common in both resident and migrant components. Most females, however, migrated to the main stem to mature, indicating female-biased migration.

J	Coe, MT				Coe, MT			Modeling terrestrial hydrological systems at the continental scale: Testing the accuracy of an atmospheric GCM	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												A global hydrological routing algorithm (HYDRA) that simulates seasonal river discharge and changes in surface water level on a spatial resolution of 5' long x 5' lat is presented. The model is based an previous work by M. T. Coe and incorporates major improvements from that work including 1) the ability to simulate monthly and seasonal variations in discharge and lake and wetland level, and 2) direct representation of man-made dams and reservoirs. HYDRA requires as input daily or monthly mean averages of runoff, precipitation, and evaporation either from GCM output or observations. As an example of the utility of HYDRA in evaluating GCM simulations, the model is forced with monthly mean estimates of runoff from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis dataset. The simulated river discharge clearly shows that although the NCEP runoff captures the large-scale features of the observed terrestrial hydrology, there are numerous differences in detail from observations. The simulated mean annual discharge is within +/-20% at only 13 of 90 fluvial gauging stations compared. In general, the discharge is overestimated for most of the northern high latitudes, midcontinental North America, eastern Europe. central and eastern Asia, India, and northern Africa. Only in western Europe and eastern North America is the discharge consistently underestimated. Although there appears to be a need for improved simulation of land surface physics in the NCEP product and parameterization of how velocities within HYDRA, the timing of the monthly mean discharge is in fair agreement with the observations. Including lakes within HYDRA reduces the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of discharge and the magnitude of the annual mean discharge of the St. Lawrence River system, in qualitative agreement with the observations. In addition, including the wetlands of the Sudd reduces the magnitude of the simulated annual discharge of the Nile River to values in better agreement with observations. Finally, the impact of man-made dams and their reservoirs on the magnitude of monthly mean discharge can be explicitly included within HYDRA. As an example, including darns and reservoirs on the Parana River improves the agreement of the simulated mean monthly discharge with observations by reducing the amplitude of the seasonal cycle to values in good agreement with the observations. The results of this study show that, although improvements can be obtained through better representations of flow velocities and more accurate digital elevation models. HYDRA can be a powerful tool for diagnosing simulated terrestrial hydrology and investigations of global climate change.

The element content in soft tissue and shell biomass. the seasonal variations of element concentrations in soft tissues and Shell, and the relationship between element concentrations in the water and those in the tissues were estimated in pursuit of this objective. Thirteen mussel samplings were performed in Lake Maggiore between May 2003 and September 2004 and in Lake Candia between Jane 2003 and August 2004. Filtered water samples were collected seasonally. Water, shell and soft tisses samples were analysed by ICP-OES and ICP-MS for the measurement of following elements: Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, As, Pb, Co, Cr, Mo, V, Cd, Be and Ca. The element concentrations in the mussel tissues and shell from Lake Magagiore were higher than those front Lake Candia. Due to the higher population density and higher element concentrations in the mussels of Lake Maggiore, the element content in the biomass per m(2) in this lake far exceeded that in Lake Candia. The element concentrations in the mussel tissues, but not in their shells, of both lakes showed a seasonal pattern of variation: this was to be expected as a result of the slower turnover time of the elements in the shell than in the tissues. For all the elements. except Mo, Cr and Be, the "concentration factor" (C.F.) value was higher in Lake Maggiore than in Lake Candia mussels, ranging from 10 to 10(4) and 10 to 10(3) respectively. The higher concentrations in the mussel tissues from Lake Moggiore were justified not merely by the higher element concentrations in the lake water, but probably also because other causes, such as element Concentrations in food and element abundance in available forms, combine to affect the concentrations of the elements in the tissues.					; Riccardi, Nicoletta/ABD-3351-2020; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/G-1756-2013	Beone, Gian Maria/0000-0002-5124-860X; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/0000-0002-5297-3387													1129-5767	1723-8633					2007	66	1					28	39		10.4081/jlimnol.2007.28	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2007.28													WOS:000249928300004

The seasonal variation of iron (Fe) distributed in two freshwater peatland ecosystems dominated by Calamagrostis angustifolia (CA) and Carex lasiocarpa (CL), was observed in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The compartmentalization of the Fe cycle including storage in the atmosphere, litter, soil, and above- and below ground plant material was determined. The results showed that the Fe input from rain was 0.06 g m(-2) a(-1), and the total Fe mass in the peatland ecosystem was 5.18 x 10(3) for CA and 1.40 x 10(3) g m(-2) for CL. The major Fe pools were soils (98.6% and 97.1% for CA and CL, respectively). The Fe fluxes between each compartment resulted in the increase of the belowground Fe pool and decrease of the litter Fe pool currently both for CA and CL. CL has greater uptake coefficient (0.024) and cycle coefficient (0.034), but smaller use coefficient (0.58) than that of CA (0.02, 0.006, and 0.77, respectively). Peatland conversion for agriculture affected the former natural Fe cycle processes and mass balance to a certain extent in long term, because the Fe assimilated by soybean and rice are less than that of CA and CL, and cannot return to soils from harvesting. Drainage and ditch excavation for agricultural conversion caused considerable Fe loss via aqueous movement, so that Fe was likely lost and transported downstream by these ditch networks.

However, the research on the characterization of V in sediment-water interface (SWI) remains limited. In this study, seasonal sampling was conducted in algal- and macrophyte-dominated zones via the method of in situ high-resolution diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT). The concentration of dissolved V in water in algal-dominated regions (12 sites) exceeded the long-term ecotoxicology limit of 1.2 mu g center dot L-1. Seasonal variations of chemical speciation of V were observed in three ecological sites. DGTlabile V at the SWI exhibited two basic patterns associated with eutrophic status, one showing sharply decreasing gradients in the vicinity of the SWI and the other showing the absence of diffusion gradient. Positive correlations were observed between the water-dissolved V and the DGT-labile V, indicating DGT-labile V is a sensitive indicator for the release of V from sediment into water. Moreover, the mobility of V was influenced by the reduction of Fe(hydr)oxides and complexation with organic matter, in particular, during periods of algal blooms. It is suggested that V contamination at the SWI of algal-dominated zones deserves additional attention.					; li, zhou/AGZ-7953-2022	Wang, Yan/0000-0002-2240-7309; Zhang, Lan/0009-0001-5609-9973; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 25	2023	901								165715	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165715		AUG 2023						37516179					WOS:001052471400001

The sequelae include temporary or permanent disability. This study aimed to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects related to stingray injuries in such populations. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Extractive Reserve of Tapajos-Arapiuns, located in the municipalities of Santarem and Aveiro (Para State). A convenience sample comprising 300 local adults was used to obtain data by means of a questionnaire/interview. Results: Overall, 19 (6.3%) participants reported having sustained a stingray injury in the 12 months prior to the study. All 19 were injured either while fishing (n=13 [68.4%]) or engaging in other riverine activities. Most injuries [n=14 (73.7%)] occurred from September through November, and most injured respondents [n=15 (78.9%)] reported seeing stingrays at beaches. Severe pain and the appearance of ulcers in the later stages of envenomation were described by 18 (94.7%) and 12 (63.2%) participants, respectively. Conclusions: Freshwater stingray injuries, which should be considered occupational injuries, are common in the study area, especially in places like beaches or in the lakes that form during the dry season, when stingrays are routinely observed. A significant proportion of respondents was unaware of the correct first aid measures and had insufficient resources to treat the complications of these injuries in the locality where they reside. Interactive activities involving local residents - such as lectures and the distribution of simple pamphlets providing information about stingray injuries - are needed.					de Siqueira França, Francisco/AAE-6314-2019; Haddad, Vidal/G-9819-2012	Martins Abati, Paulo Afonso/0000-0002-8340-9877; Franca, Francisco Oscar de Siqueira/0000-0001-8510-7939													0037-8682					MAY-JUN	2017	50	3					374	378		10.1590/0037-8682-0016-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0016-2017								28700056					WOS:000405416000014

The aim of this study is to understand the record of water level fluctuations in Lagunillo del Tejo over the last two-and-a-half centuries. This information could be used in future studies to interpret longer sedimentary sequences. We analysed photosynthetic pigments, diatoms and cladoceran remains in sediment sequences recovered from the deepest part of the lake. The paleoecological proxies traced two different communities which have switched their prevalence during the past: (1) a planktonic community of algae, including diatoms, chlorophytes, cryptophytes and cyanobacteria, and phototrophic bacteria associated with higher lake level and water column seasonal stratification; (2) a littoral community with the higher levels of macrophyte pigments and associated epiphytic diatoms and chydorids, all of which indicate lower lake level. The levels of coherence between different proxies, each having an independent mechanistic link to lake-level variability, enhance the reliability of palaeolimnological inferences. The high-resolution stratigraphical data from the upper part of the core was compared with lake-level inferences from instrumental rainfall series (1859-2005) to establish the correspondence between Lagunillo del Tejo sediment sequences and climate record.

J	Ichinotsuka, D; Ueno, H; Nakano, SI				Ichinotsuka, D; Ueno, H; Nakano, SI			Relative importance of nanoflagellates and ciliates as consumers of bacteria in a coastal sea area dominated by oligotrichous Strombidium and Strobilidium	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												To examine the relative importance of nanoflagellates and ciliates as grazers of bacteria, we examined seasonal changes in their consumption of bacteria in a coastal sea, where the oligotrichous ciliates Strombidium and Strobilidium are dominant throughout the year. The numbers of these 2 dominant taxa accounted for 16 to 71 % (average 55 %) of the total ciliate numbers. Other ciliate taxa which seasonally dominated were photosynthetic Myrionecta rubra, the aloricate oligotrichs Laboea and Lohmaniella, the loricate oligotrichs Tintinnopsis, Cyttarocylis, and scuticociliates. Fluorescently labelled 0.5 mu m diameter beads were used to determine grazing rates. Bacterivory was detected for nanoflagellates, Strombidium, Strobilidium, Lohmaniella, Tintinnopsis and Cyttarocylis. Ingestion rates on bacteria by nanoflagellates ranged between 0.3 and 2.2 bacteria protistan cell(-1) h(-1). Ingestion rates of the dominant ciliate taxa Strombidium and Strobilidium, when feeding on bacteria, varied from 7 to 34 bacteria protistan cell(-1) h(-1), though the rates were low relative to those of other dominant ciliate taxa (14 to 50 bacteria protistan cell(-1) h(-1)). Significant relationships (p < 0.01) were found between the cell numbers of bacteria and ingestion rates of nanoflagellates, and between the cell numbers of bacteria and ingestion rates of Strombidium, whereas the relationship between the cell numbers of bacteria and ingestion rates of the total ciliates was not significant. Turnover rates of bacteria due to grazing by the total ciliates (0 to 0.63 % d(-1)) were lower than those by nanoflagellates (1 to 15 % d(-1)). Thus, it is likely that the dominant ciliates in the bay are not important grazers of bacteria, and that the main grazers of bacteria are nanoflagellates.

The present study investigated the potential bioaccumulation and biotransfer of bisphenol (BP) compounds that are widely added in various products such as plastics and other products in a freshwater ecosystem, China. Among commonly applied 14 BP analogues, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol S (BPS) were predominant, representing 64%-100% of the total concentrations of BPs (& sigma;BPs) in freshwater wildlife. Both the concentrations and analogue profiles in the fish showed seasonal differences and species dependence. Higher BP concentrations were observed in fish collected during the dry season than the wet season. Higher percentages of non-BPA analogues (e.g., BPS and BPF) were observed in fish collected during the wet season. Pelagic species accumulated notably higher levels of BPs than midwater and bottom species. The liver generally contained the highest & sigma;BPs, followed successively by the swim bladder, belly fat, and dorsal muscle. The analogue profile also showed some differences among tissues, varying by species and season. Lower & sigma;BPs but higher percentages of non-BPA analogues were observed in female than male common carp. Time trends of the BPA concentration in fish varied by species, probably related to habitats and diets of the fish. Habitats, feeding behaviors, and trophic transfer may have significant impacts on exposure of wildlife to BPs in natural ecosystems. The BPs did not demonstrate strong potential for bioaccumulation. More research is warranted about metabolism and transgenerational transfer of BPs in wildlife to fully reveal the bioaccumulation and consequently ecological risks of these chemicals in the environment.

The paleoclimate provides real climate scenarios to examine IOD behaviors and the linkage to basic states. Based on 18 models from phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5/6), the IOD change from the preindustrial period to the mid-Holocene is investigated. The multimodel mean reveals that the IOD variability weakens by 14%, as measured by the standard deviation of the dipole mode index, which is defined using the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) difference. Such attenuation is dominated by the spatially consistent suppression in the western-pole SST variability, while the eastern pole contributes little due to the opposite-signed changes in its north-western and southeastern portions. The primary reason for the aforementioned changes comes from the altered climatic background, which displays a positive IOD-like pattern during IOD growing seasons, with intensified westward currents along the equator and northwestward currents in the southeastern equatorial IO. Such changes in the mean-state currents modulate the strength of the IOD-related anomalous advection and subsequently cause alterations in the IOD variability. Further analyses show that the IOD attenuation in the mid-Holocene is unlikely to be caused by the concurrently subdued El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the tropical Pacific, partially because of the diminished connections between the two oscil-lations themselves. The above simulated changes in both the IO mean climatology and IOD variability agree well with the available paleo records in literature.

In this study, the influence of environmental variables, water level changes, and periodic mixing on zooplankton distribution and abundance was seasonally studied for Lake Ardibo from October 2020 to September 2021 collected from 3 sites. Results on the physico-chemical variables indicated that all variables, except turbidity, varied significantly (p < 0.05) in all sampling seasons. A total of 33 zooplankton species were recorded, comprising 18 rotifers, 11 cladocerans, and 4 cyclopoid copepods. Zooplankton abundance significantly varied seasonally with peak abundance (4232.13 ind. L-1) recorded in the dry season and lowest numbers (402.42 ind. L-1) during the long rainy period. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results indicated that total phosphorus, ammonia, water temperature, silicon dioxide, and conductivity were the most significant driving forces for the seasonal successions in the abundance and distribution of zooplankton communities. Cyclopoid copepod abundance was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the dry season, which could be correlated with the partial mixing (atelomixis) phenomenon that occurred during the dry period.					; Mengistou, Seyoum/MVU-3709-2025	Fetahi, Tadesse/0000-0002-7586-5354; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2023	195	8							927	10.1007/s10661-023-11500-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11500-6								37428335					WOS:001025825400001

A total of 19 different genera of phytoplankton belonging to 5 phyla were recorded. Among all the groups, Chlorophyceae was found to be dominated by 8 genera followed by Bacillariophycaeae (4 genera), Cyanophyceae (4 genera), Euglenophyceae (2 genera), and Zygnematophyceae (1 genus). Seasonal variability showed maximum dominance of phytoplankton during post-monsoon and least during pre-monsoon months. Shannon-Wiener diversity (H & PRIME;) indices indicated Bacillariophyceae to be most species rich (1.059) while the most dominant group (D) was observed to be Chlorophyceae (0.507). Assessment of Palmer algal pollution index (PI) revealed the water body is impacted by high organic pollution during monsoon (22) compared to the pre-monsoon (19) and post-monsoon seasons (15). The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated water temperature, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity as the major influencing parameters for growth and distribution of the phytoplankton in the water body. Therefore, it can be stated that hydrological alteration of a water body fed with wastewater plays a significant role in regulating the plankton density, richness, and diversity.

We studied variation in the composition of fatty acids in the seston of a small freshwater reservoir with changes in phytoplankton composition during four growth seasons. We focused on the dynamics of the omega3 fatty acids because of their potential importance for zooplankton nutrition. 2. Total diatoms were related to the 20:5omega3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic, EPA) content in seston. Among two dominant diatom genera, Cyclotella was not associated with EPA content. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between Stephanodiscus and the percentage contribution and content of EPA throughout the study. Hence, freshwater diatoms can differ strongly in content of the essential EPA. 3. We considered abundant cyanobacteria as a potential source of 18:3omega3 fatty acid (linolenic, ALA) to aquatic food webs. Among four dominant cyanobacteria species, two (Anabaena flos-aquae and Planktothrix agardhii) showed significant correlation with the ALA content of the seston, while the other two (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Microcystis aeruginosa) did not. 4. Dinophyta had a relatively high level of 22:6omega3 (docosahexaenoic, DHA) for freshwater species and can be also a source of EPA to aquatic food webs. 5. Our results show that various species of diatoms as well as cyanobacteria can be of contrasting nutritional value for zooplankton because of their different content of the essential PUFAs. Diatoms, which are low in EPA, could not be considered as a valuable food, while some field populations of cyanobacteria might be valuable sources of essential ALA.

Because of the ecological, economic, and cultural importance of lake whitefish, a variety of research projects in the Great Lakes have recently been conducted to better understand how populations may be affected by reductions in growth and condition. Based upon our participation in projects intended to establish linkages between reductions in growth and condition and important population demographic attributes (natural mortality and recruitment potential), we offer the following recommendations for future studies meant to assess the health of Laurentian Great Lakes lake whitefish populations: (1) broaden the spatial coverage of comparative studies of demographic rates and fish health; (2) combine large-scale field studies with direct experimentation; (3) conduct multi-disciplinary evaluation of stocks; (4) conduct analyses at finer spatial and temporal scales; (5) quantify stock intermixing and examine how intermixing affects harvest policy performance on individual stocks; (6) examine the role of movement ill explaining seasonal fluctuations of disease and pathogen infection and transmission; (7) evaluate sampling protocols for collecting individuals for pathological and compositional examination; (8) quantify sea lamprey-induced mortality; and (9) enact long-term monitoring programs of stock health.

J	Smith, SN; Mueller, SF				Smith, S. N.; Mueller, S. F.			Modeling natural emissions in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model-I: building an emissions data base	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A natural emissions inventory for the continental United States and surrounding territories is needed in order to use the US Environmental Protection Agency Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model for simulating natural air quality. The CMAQ air modeling system (including the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) emissions processing system) currently estimates non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) emissions from biogenic sources, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from soils, ammonia from animals, several types of particulate and reactive gas emissions from fires, as well as sea salt emissions. However, there are several emission categories that are not commonly treated by the standard CMAQ Model system. Most notable among these are nitrogen oxide emissions from lightning, reduced sulfur emissions from oceans, geothermal features and other continental sources, windblown dust particulate, and reactive chlorine gas emissions linked with sea salt chloride. A review of past emissions modeling work and existing global emissions data bases provides information and data necessary for preparing a more complete natural emissions data base for CMAQ applications. A model-ready natural emissions data base is developed to complement the anthropogenic emissions inventory used by the VISTAS Regional Planning Organization in its work analyzing regional haze based on the year 2002. This new data base covers a modeling domain that includes the continental United States plus large portions of Canada, Mexico and surrounding oceans. Comparing July 2002 source data reveals that natural emissions account for 16% of total gaseous sulfur (sulfur dioxide, dimethylsulfide and hydrogen sulfide), 44% of total NOx, 80% of reactive carbonaceous gases (NMVOCs and carbon monoxide), 28% of ammonia, 96% of total chlorine (hydrochloric acid, nitryl chloride and sea salt chloride), and 84% of fine particles (i.e., those smaller than 2.5 mu m in size) released into the atmosphere. The seasonality and relative importance of the various natural emissions categories are described.																			1680-7316	1680-7324					2010	10	10					4931	4952		10.5194/acp-10-4931-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-10-4931-2010													WOS:000278184700033
J	Dagne, A; Herzig, A; Jersabek, CD; Tadesse, Z				Dagne, Adamneh; Herzig, Alois; Jersabek, Christian D.; Tadesse, Zenebe			Abundance, species composition and spatial distribution of planktonic rotifers and crustaceans in Lake Ziway (Rift Valley, Ethiopia)	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution of rotifer and crustacean zooplankton were studied in Lake Ziway from late April to early July 2004. A total of 49 rotifer species was recorded, with Anuraeopsis fissa, Brachionus angularis, Filinia novaezealandiae, and Trichocerea ruttneri being numerically dominant. Variation in abundance was extremely high, ranging from 2 to 1000+ individuals per litre. There was no significant difference in the distribution of rotifer species between inshore and offshore regions. Crustacean species richness was low, with only five cladoceran and three copepod species occurring in the open water. Moina micrura and Diaphanosoma excisum dominated the cladoceran community, whereas Thermocyclops decipiens was the dominant copepod. Although numerically dominant (75%), rotifers accounted for less than 30% of mean total zooplankton biomass. Peak abundance of crustaceans was observed in May and June, following the onset of the rainy season and increased phytoplankton production. Variation in the spatial distribution of crustacean species was neither observed horizontally between inshore and offshore areas nor vertically in the highly turbid and wind exposed deeper part of the lake. On the other hand, Moina micrura varied significantly in size between inshore and offshore areas. Adult M. micrura dominated offshore, whereas juveniles were more abundant inshore, suggesting a predominantly littoral selective predation on large and adult crustaceans by fish.

All these results concur to a much enhanced monsoon on most of China during the first half of the Holocene. Second we present, in some details, a temporal study of a core (Lake Bayanchagan, Inner Mongolia) located in an arid region at the edge of the present East Asian Monsoon (EAM) influence and then sensitive to climatic change. This study involves pollen data together with other macro-remains and stable isotope curve to obtain a robust climate reconstruction. This study shows a long wet period between 11 000 and 5000 years BP divided in two parts, a warmer one from 11 000 and 8000 (marked by large evapotranspiration) and a cooler one more favourable to forest expansion. Third, we present a spatial study based on pollen data only and covering all China and Mongolia at 6000 years BP, but using a mechanistic modelling approach, in an inverse mode. It has the advantage to take into account environmental context different from the present one (lower atmospheric CO2, different seasonality). This study shows temperature generally cooler than present one in southern China, but a significant warming was found over Mongolia, and a slightly higher in northeast China. Precipitation was generally higher than today in southern, northeast China, and northern Mongolia, but lower or similar to today in northwest China and north China. Enhanced EAM was then found in the southern half of China and in northeast China.					; Guiot, Joel/G-7818-2011	Guiot, Joel/0000-0001-7345-4466; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2008	4	2					137	145		10.5194/cp-4-137-2008	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-4-137-2008													WOS:000257303600005
J	Håkanson, L; Bryhn, AC				Hakanson, Lars; Bryhn, Andreas C.			A dynamic mass-balance model for phosphorus in lakes with a focus on criteria for applicability and boundary conditions	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This paper presents an improved version of a general, process-based mass-balance model (LakeMab/LEEDS) for phosphorus in entire lakes (the ecosystem scale). The focus in this work is set on the boundary conditions, i.e., the domain of the model, and critical tests to reveal those boundary conditions using data from a wide limnological range. The basic structure of the model, and many key equations have been presented and motivated before, but this work presents several new developments. The LakeMab-model is based on ordinary differential equations regulating inflow, outflow and internal fluxes and the temporal resolution is one month to reflect seasonal variations. The model consists of four compartments: surface water, deep water, sediment on accumulation areas and sediment on areas of erosion and transportation. The separation between the surface-water layer and the deep-water layer is not done from water temperature data, but from sedimentological criteria (from the theoretical wave base, which regulates where wind/wave-induced resuspension of fine sediments occurs). There are algorithms for processes regulating internal fluxes and internal loading, e.g., sedimentation, resuspension, diffusion, mixing and burial. Critical model tests were made using data from 41 lakes of very different character and the results show that the model could predict mean monthly TP-concentrations in water very well (generally within the uncertainty bands given by the empirical data). The model is even easier to apply than the well-known OECD and Vollenweider models due to more easily accessed driving variables.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	2008	187	1-4					119	147		10.1007/s11270-007-9502-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-007-9502-1													WOS:000251322200011
J	Williamson, CE; De Lange, HJ; Leech, DM				Williamson, Craig E.; De Lange, Hendrika J.; Leech, Dina M.			Do zooplankton contribute to an ultraviolet clear-water phase in lakes?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal increases in the ultraviolet (UV) transparency of the surface waters of an oligotrophic lake in Pennsylvania suggest that clear-water phase (CWP) events similar to those previously observed for visible light also exist for the potentially damaging UV wavelengths. Seasonal increases in zooplankton grazers indicate that they play a role in these changes in UV that is similar to the role that zooplankton play in CWP events involving longer-wavelength visible, or photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 rim). The potential role of zooplankton and incident UV in generating UV CWP events was investigated with a set of in situ microcosm experiments that manipulated UV and zooplankton, and followed changes in particulate and dissolved absorbance in the UV (320 nm) and PAR wavelength ranges over an 8-d period in April. Nutrients were also manipulated independently to examine the potential role of nutrient regeneration by zooplankton grazing in altering water transparency. Photobleaching by incident solar UV led to a strong and significant decrease in dissolved UV and PAR absorbance. The presence of zooplankton grazers also significantly decreased dissolved UV absorbance but increased dissolved PAR absorbance. Neither zooplankton nor UV had any significant effects on UV or PAR absorbance by particulates. In contrast, nutrient additions significantly increased dissolved absorbance in both the UV and PAR wavelength ranges, indicating that regeneration of nutrients by zooplankton offsets decreases in UV absorbance and enhances increases in PAR absorbance due to grazing. While photobleaching by UV radiation is likely to make a consistent strong contribution to UV CWP events in lakes, the net effects of zooplankton on UV transparency in a given lake will depend upon multiple factors including zooplankton density and a balance between the edibility and extent of nutrient limitation of the phytoplankton.

To seek the key factor that affects their growth, monthly investigations of submersed macrophytes were conducted in 20 regions of four Yangtze lakes during December, 2001-March, 2003. Analyses based on annual values show that the ratio of Secchi depth to mean depth is the key factor (50% of macrophyte biomass variability among these lakes is statistically explained). Further analyses also demonstrate that the months from March to June are not only the actively growing season for most macrophytes, but the key time the factor acts. Five key-time models yielding higher predictive power (r(2) reaches 0.75,0.76,0.77,0.69 and 0.81) are generated. A comparison between key-time models and traditional synchronic ones indicates that key-time models have higher predictive power. Analyses of transparency thresholds during macrophyte growing season and the limitations of the models are presented. The models and other results may benefit the work concerning submersed macrophyte recovery in Yangtze lakes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because climatic conditions of the Southwestern USA are different than temperate environments, DOM from three freshwater reservoirs (Saguaro Lake, Bartlett Lake and Lake Pleasant) was investigated to determine the importance of allochthonous and autochthonous organic material. Results from the study show hydrophobic acids constitute a small percentage of the DOM, while the neutral and hydrophilic fractions are more prevalent. C/N ratios are comparatively low relative to other freshwater systems, ranging between 28 and 35 for the hydrophobic acid fractions, while DOC/DON ratios are seasonally influenced by epilimnionic algal growth. The isolated organic fractions were low in aromatic content measured by solid-state C-13 NMR resulting in low aromatic to aliphatic carbon ratios. Organic material recovered from Saguaro Lake and Lake Pleasant display traits that suggest most allochthonous contributions are highly attenuated favoring organic material from autochthonous sources (low C/N and aromatic/aliphatic carbon ratios), whereas organic material from Bartlett Lake demonstrated a greater seasonal perturbation in source influence.

DO is known to influence the respiratory morphology of gymnotiform fishes, and yet species-level variation among congeners endemic to alternative DO regimes has not been examined. We describe the DO environment experienced by four congeneric species of gymnotiforms (Brachyhypopomus) and correlate this to quantitative variation in a suite of gill metrics. Whitewater floodplain lakes flanking nutrient-rich whitewater rivers are seasonally hypoxic, exhibiting oxygen concentrations close to 0 mg/l from late April until September. In contrast, DO levels in blackwater floodplain lakes and in terra firme forest stream habitats remain high throughout the year. Two common species of Brachyhypopomus restricted to periodically anoxic whitewater floodplain exhibited a substantially greater gill size than two common species restricted to the perpetually well-oxygenated waters of blackwater floodplain lakes and terra firme stream systems. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) based on gill metrics separated the species that live in seasonally anoxic whitewater floodplain species from those that live in perpetually-well oxygenated habitats. Our observations suggest a history of adaptive divergence in the gill morphology of Brachyhypopomus associated with oxygen availability.

Biogeochemical Processes and Microbial Dynamics Governing Phosphorus Retention and Release in Sediments: A Case Study in Lower Great Lakes Headwaters	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The ability of headwater bed and suspended sediments to mitigate non-point agricultural phosphorus (P) loads to the lower Great Lakes is recognized, but the specific biogeochemical processes promoting sediment P retention or internal P release remain poorly understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, three headwater segments located within priority watersheds of Southern Ontario, Canada, were sampled through the growing season of 2018-2020. The study employed equilibrium P assays along with novel assessments of legacy watershed nutrients, nitrogen (N) concentrations, sediment redox, and microbial community composition. 20-year data revealed elevated total P (TP) and total Nitrogen (TN) at an inorganic fertilizer and manure fertilizer-impacted site, respectively. Overall, sampled sites acted as P sinks; however, agricultural sediments exhibited significantly lower buffering capacity compared to a reference forested watershed. Collection of fine suspended sediment (<63 & mu;m) through time-integrated sampling showed the suspended load at the inorganic-fertilized site was saturated with P, indicating a greater potential for P release into surface waters compared to bed sediments. Through vertical microsensor profiling and DNA sequencing of the sediment microbial community, site-specific factors associated with a distinct P-source event were identified. These included rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) across the sediment water interface (SWI), as well as the presence of nitrate-reducing bacterial and ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) genera. This research provides valuable insights into the dynamics of P in headwaters, shedding light on P retention and release. Understanding these processes is crucial for effective management strategies aimed at mitigating P pollution to the lower Great Lakes.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2023	72	5					932	944		10.1007/s00267-023-01859-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-023-01859-0		JUL 2023						37505273					WOS:001039855400001
J	Bridi, LC; Rafael, MS				Bridi, L. C.; Rafael, M. S.			GNBP domain of Anopheles darlingi: are polymorphic inversions and gene variation related to adaptive evolution?	GENETICA												Anopheles darlingi is the main malaria vector in humans in South America. In the Amazon basin, it lives along the banks of rivers and lakes, which responds to the annual hydrological cycle (dry season and rainy season). In these breeding sites, the larvae of this mosquito feed on decomposing organic and microorganisms, which can be pathogenic and trigger the activation of innate immune system pathways, such as proteins Gram-negative binding protein (GNBP). Such environmental changes affect the occurrence of polymorphic inversions especially at the heterozygote frequency, which confer adaptative advantage compared to homozygous inversions. We mapped the GNBP probe to the An. darlingi 2Rd inversion by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), which was a good indicator of the GNBP immune response related to the chromosomal polymorphic inversions and adaptative evolution. To better understand the evolutionary relations and time of divergence of the GNBP of An. darlingi, we compared it with nine other mosquito GNBPs. The results of the phylogenetic analysis of the GNBP sequence between the species of mosquitoes demonstrated three clades. Clade I and II included the GNBPB5 sequence, and clade III the sequence of GNBPB1. Most of these sequences of GNBP analyzed were homologous with that of subfamily B, including that of An. gambiae (87 %), therefore suggesting that GNBP of An. darling belongs to subfamily B. This work helps us understand the role of inversion polymorphism in evolution of An. darlingi.					rafael, miriam/K-4170-2012	Rafael, Miriam/0000-0003-4726-855X													0016-6707	1573-6857				FEB	2016	144	1					99	106		10.1007/s10709-016-9881-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-016-9881-6								26767379					WOS:000370160200009

The effect of natural and anthropogenic factors on the evolution of remote lakes in East Siberia for the last 200 years	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We performed a regional analysis of the effect of anthropogenic (acid precipitation) and natural (climatic changes, endogenous methane) factors on the hydrochemical composition and phytoplankton of mountain lakes in East Siberia for the last 210 years. The lacustrine diatom community responded to the intense acid precipitation that led to the acidification of lakes in Europe and North America in 1950-1985: Cyclotella-complex was partly replaced by more pH-tolerant species of diatoms, such as Aulacoseira lirata, A. italica, and Tabellaria flocculosa. This anthropogenic impact, however, was not dramatic for the ecosystem of mountain Lake Oron. The diatom records distinctly show a tendency for the reduction of lacustrine-alga population since the end of the Little Ice Age. We assume that the decrease in the Oron bioproductivity was mainly due to a deficit of nutrients caused by the inflow of ultrafresh waters from the thawing glaciers, snow patches, and seasonal snow cover of the Kodar Ridge during the Recent global warming in the Northern Hemisphere. In addition, the changes in the lake ecosystem might have been accelerated by emissions of endogenous methane. (C) 2016, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Geddes, P; Trexler, JC				Geddes, P; Trexler, JC			Uncoupling of omnivore-mediated positive and negative effects on periphyton mats	OECOLOGIA												The riverine grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus) and eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) consume periphyton and small invertebrates, potentially affecting periphyton through negative effects (i.e., consumption) and/or positive effects such as nutrient regeneration, physical stimulation, and trophic cascades. We performed field experiments in the Everglades in which omnivores and periphyton were maintained in cages, with a fraction of the periphyton held in omnivore-exclusion bags that allowed passage of nutrients but prevented its consumption or physical disturbance. In some instances, periphyton growth rate increased with increasing omnivore biomass. Omnivores probably stimulated periphyton growth through nutrient regeneration, possibly subsidizing periphyton with nutrients derived from ingested animal prey. The net balance of omnivore-mediated negative and positive effects varied among experiments because of seasonal and spatial differences in periphyton characteristics. Consumption of periphyton mats might have been reduced by the arrangement of palatable algae (green algae and diatoms) within a matrix of unpalatable ones (CaCO3-encrusting filamentous cyanobacteria). In a laboratory feeding experiment, mosquitofish consumed more green algae and diatoms in treatments with disrupted mat structure than in those with intact mats. No difference in diet was observed for shrimp. Our study underscores the complexity of consumer-periphyton interactions in which periphyton edibility affects herbivory and consumers influence periphyton through multiple routes that cannot be fully appreciated in experiments that only investigate net effects.

J	Kornis, MS; Janssen, J				Kornis, Matthew S.; Janssen, John			Linking emergent midges to alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) preference for rocky habitat in Lake Michigan littoral zones	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) abundance and condition are in decline in Lake Michigan, where they not only exert negative effects on several native fish species but also support an economically valuable salmon sport fishery. We investigated feeding-related habitat selection for adult alewives occurring in Lake Michigan's littoral zone by comparing the relative abundance of alewives and non-biting midges (Chironomidae) on littoral rocky and sandy habitats. Both alewives and midges strongly favored hard over soft substrate, with approximately 22 and 23 times greater catch rates on rock than sand, respectively, from June through August 2005. Relative to sand, 92.2% of alewives and 94.8% of emergent midges were captured over rocky habitat. Gut content analysis suggested that the supplement of midge pupae created a benefit for alewives on rocky habitat and that midge emergence may be the basis for rocky habitat selection. Alewife consumption of midge pupae correlated with midge emergence events, frequency occurrence of midges in ale wife diets was significantly greater on rocky habitat, and alewives collected over sand were 1.5 times more likely to have empty stomachs than those collected over rocks. Our results indicate that alewives, the dominant pelagic forage fish in lake Michigan, are seasonally encountered in littoral rocky communities, where midges are an important seasonal component of alewife diet.

Freshwater control of ice-rafted debris in the last glacial period at Mono Lake, California, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The type section silts of the late Pleistocene Wilson Creek Formation at Mono Lake contain outsized clasts, dominantly well-rounded pebbles and cobbles of Sierran lithologies. Lithic grains >4251 mu m show a similar pattern of variability as the >10 mm clasts visible in the type section, with decreasing absolute abundance in southern and eastern outcrops. The largest concentrations of ice-rafted debris (IRD) occur at 67-57 ka and 46-32 ka, with strong millennial-scale variability, while little IRD is found during the last glacial maximum and deglaciation. Stratigraphic evidence for high lake level during high IRD intervals, and a lack of geomorphic evidence for coincidence of lake and glaciers, strongly suggests that rafting was by shore ice rather than icebergs. Correspondence of carbonate flux and IRD implies that both were mainly controlled by freshwater input, rather than disparate non-climatic controls. Conversely, the lack of IRD during the last glacial maximum and deglacial highstands may relate to secondary controls such as perennial ice cover or sediment supply. High IRD at Mono Lake corresponds to low glacial flour flux in Owens Lake, both correlative to high warm-season insolation. High-resolution, extra-basinal correlation of the millennial peaks awaits greatly improved age models for both records. (C) 2011 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, the chemical composition of water samples of the lake and some influent rivers was determined. We found that it is likely that the lake was influenced by the dilution of metals from ancient evaporites. We performed the first metagenomic studies of this lake. Analyses of shotgun metagenomics revealed that the relative abundances of Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales were noteworthy in the water samples, whereas the archaea belonging to the Halobacteriales and Cyanobacteria from subsection III had high abundances in the salt flat. The eukaryotes Crustacea and Diatomea exhibited the highest abundances in the water samples. We investigated further the potential effect of human activities on the nitrogen cycle mobilization in the lake and the propagation of antimicrobial resistance genes. This is the first report about the cycle in the lake. Additionally, rifamycin resistance genes and genes related to efflux pumps, which are not considered a hazard when identified in metagenomes, had the uppermost relative abundances in all sampling points. We found that Lake Pastos Grandes hitherto does not show an appreciable influence by anthropogenic actions. The microbiome of Lake Pastos Grandes, including microbial distribution, the nitrogen cycle and antibiotic resistance genes, was analyzed.

Bacteria were the best predictor of viral abundance (4.0-7.8 x 1010 viruses L-1), with an average virus-to-bacteria ratio of 13.5 +/- 1.9. Virus-induced bacterial mortality (range 37-86%, mean 65%) was higher than that in typical pelagic situations. This was related to high specific contact rates between viruses and bacterial hosts and high burst size (BS) estimates. Seasonal fluctuations in viruses and bacteria were rather homeostatic, although temperature was a major driver of microbial activities. Different bacterial morphotypes, i.e. 'morphopopulations', were analysed. Rod cells dominated the total (90%) and infected (89%) communities. Elongated rods were the most infected (45% of infected cells), whereas fat rods exhibited the highest BS estimates (mean=72 viruses per bacterium) due to a larger specific cell volume. We conclude that the lytic activity of viruses is high and heterogeneous for different bacterial-host phenotypes in the sand pit Lake Creteil. A theoretical exercise shows that this can exert a strong influence on the processes occurring in plankton food webs.

J	Schmincke, HU; Rausch, J; Kutterolf, S; Freundt, A				Schmincke, Hans-Ulrich; Rausch, Juanita; Kutterolf, Steffen; Freundt, Armin			Walking through volcanic mud: the 2,100 year-old Acahualinca footprints (Nicaragua) II: the Acahualinca people, environmental conditions and motivation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We analyzed bare human footprints in Holocene tuff preserved in two pits in the Acahualinca barrio in the northern outskirts of Managua (Nicaragua). Lithology, volcanology, and age of the deposits are discussed in a companion paper (Schmincke et al. Bull Volcanol doi: 10.1007/s00445-008-0235-9, 2008). The footprint layer occurs within a series of rapidly accumulated basaltic-andesitic tephra that is regionally correlated to the Masaya Triple Layer Tephra. The people were probably trying to escape from a powerful volcanic eruption at Masaya Caldera 20 km farther south that occurred at 2.1 ka BP. We subdivided the swath of footprints, up to 5.6 m wide, in the northern pit (Pit I) into (1) a central group of footprints made by about six individuals, the total number being difficult to determine because people walked in each other's footsteps one behind the other and (2) two marginal groups on either side of the central group with more widely spaced tracks. The western band comprises tracks of three adjacent individuals and an isolated single footprint farther out. The eastern marginal area comprises an inner band of deep footprints made by three individuals and, farther out, three clearly separated individuals. We estimate the total number of people as 15-16. In the southern narrow and smaller pit (Pit II), we recognize tracks of ca. 12 individuals, no doubt made by the same group. The group represented in both pits probably comprised male and female adults, teenagers and children based on differences in length of footprints and of strides and depth of footprints made in the soft wet ash. The smallest footprints (probably made by children) occur in the central group, where protection was most effective. The footprint layer is composed of a lower 5-15-cm thick, coarse-grained vesicle tuff capped by a medium to fine-grained tuff up to 3 cm thick. The surface on which the people walked was muddy, and the soft ash was squeezed up on the sides of the foot imprints and between toes. Especially, deep footprints are mainly due to local thickening of the water-rich ash, multiple track use, and differences in weight of individuals. The excellent preservation of the footprints, ubiquitous mudcracks, sharp and well-preserved squeeze-ups along the margins of the tracks and toe imprints, and the absence of raindrop impressions all suggest that the eruption occurred during the dry season. The people walked at a brisk pace, as judged from the tight orientation of the swath and the length of the strides. The directions of a major erosional channel in the overlying deposits that probably debouched into Lake Managua and the band of footprints are strictly parallel, indicating that people walked together in stride along the eastern margin of a channel straight toward the lake shore, possibly a site with huts and/or boats for protection and/or escape.

Samples collected during daily gathering trips over three fieldwork seasons were prepared according to Hadza methods. All three types of honey show moisture and starch levels similar to United States' honeys but higher levels of protein, fat, and ash. Several samples had significant fat levels probably due to the inclusion of bee larvae. The macronutrient composition of six fruits is comparable to those of agricultural fruits, although they were somewhat higher in crude protein, carbohydrate, and energy and somewhat lower in fat. Baobab seed flour and fruit pulp are low in energy compared with most previously published results, partially because our study measured fiber directly, unlike the methods used in any other studies. Baobab seed is high in protein and fat as reported in other studies. Our field observations, in combination with our analytical data, suggest that baobab seed is an important source of energy and protein for these foragers.

In particular, quagga mussels colonize lakes to great depths (>200 m). To better understand the colonization pattern of quagga mussels in deep lakes, we studied the settlement of quagga mussels along a depth gradient on colonization plates at multiple depths (1-140 m) in the pelagic zone of two recently invaded perialpine lakes, Lake Constance and Lake Geneva. We measured coloniza-tion rates every three months over one year on colonization plates deployed in both lakes at defined depths. We also assessed long-term population dynamics from abundance and size distribution using repeated photogrammetry of colonization plates. Highest colonization rates and largest mussel sizes occurred above 8 m depth, and almost no zebra mussels were found. Colonization rates decreased to almost zero below 30 m. Colonization rates on plates were associated with variation in environmental conditions as well as veliger densities in the plankton across season and depth. Temperature was the most important environmental parameter that influenced colonization. Our results will help to better understand the seasonal colonization patterns of invasive quagga mussels in deep lakes.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

These circulations causes seasonal variations in biophysical and chemical parameters of the lake, such as water nutrients, salinity and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). In this study, bio-optical parameters (Chl-a concentration, absorption by colored dissolved organic matter & detritus and backscattering by suspended particles) of Chilika Lake were estimated using multispectral remote sensing data of Oceansat-2 Ocean Color Monitor (OCM-2, spatial resolution similar to 360 m) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI, spatial resolution similar to 30 m) sensors. Spectral matching technique was implemented on the satellite derived remote sensing reflectance spectra (RrsokTHORN) to estimate the bio-optical parameters. Both OLI and OCM-2 revealed that the southern and central portion of Chilika has a relatively higher phytoplankton productivity (8 mg m(-3) <= Chl-a <= 15 mg m(-3)) when compared to the northern sector. Also, retrieval from both the satellites could capture the presence of a high sediment load in the northern sector. Application of spectral matching technique requires accurate estimation of RrsokTHORN from a satellite image. For this purpose, atmospheric corrections were implemented on both OLI and OCM-2 level-1b data. Processing of OLI data was done using SWIR (short wave infrared) atmospheric correction algorithm with the help of ACOLITE software. For OCM-2, due to the absence of SWIR bands, we used the standard atmospheric correction algorithm with certain modifications to obtain accurate results over the turbid waters of Chilika Lake. R-rs from OCM-2 were compared with in situ measured reflectance. Both the shape and magnitude of the spectra compared well, with relative errors ranging from 8.75 to 32.78 %. The modified atmospheric correction algorithm is useful for multi-spectral data that does not have SWIR bands and can be implemented over any inland and coastal water bodies having clear oceanic pixels in its vicinity.																			0255-660X	0974-3006				AUG	2023	51	8					1729	1737		10.1007/s12524-023-01716-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-023-01716-x		JUL 2023											WOS:001033436200001

Comparative productivity of six bioenergy cropping systems on marginal lands in the Great Lakes Region, United States	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Growing lignocellulosic crops on marginal lands is a promising solution for sustainable biofuel production. We evaluated the productivity of bioenergy cropping systems (switchgrass [Panicum virgatum L., var. Cave-In-Rock], miscanthus [Miscanthus x giganteus, 'Illinois clone'], hybrid poplar [Populus nigra x P. maximowiczii A. Henry 'NM6'], native grasses [five species], early successional vegetation, and restored prairie vs. historical vegetation [as reference control]) with and without nitrogen fertilization on low-fertility former cropland at five sites in the Great Lakes Region, United States. We reported biomass yields for the first 7 years after establishment. Switchgrass was most consistently productive across all sites but miscanthus was more productive at three of the five sites. When averaged across sites, years, and nitrogen (N) treatments, biomass yields followed the order miscanthus > switchgrass > hybrid poplar & AP; native grasses > restored prairie > early successional vegetation & AP; historical vegetation, but varied substantially by crop and site, with a significant crop by site interaction. Yields of miscanthus and switchgrass peaked after four-five growing seasons and declined thereafter, while yields of both native grasses and restored prairie increased throughout 6 years with no sign of follow-on decline, suggesting that polycultures may outperform monocultures over the long term. Yields of early successional vegetation-similar in composition to historical vegetation at each site-did not improve with time. Nitrogen fertilization increased the yields of all cropping systems at all sites. Our results demonstrate the viability of low-productivity former cropland for long-term bioenergy production and suggest there is no single crop best suited for all low fertility soils.

Their long evolution led to several adaptations to avoid deleterious effects caused by exposure to solar UV radiation. Synthesis of sunscreen substances, such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), allows them to photosynthesise with reduced risk of cell damage. The interplay of solar UV radiation and MAAs is well documented for cyanobacteria in the plankton realm, but little is known for those in the benthic realm, particularly of clear alpine lakes. Here, we assessed the temporal dynamics of MAAs in the benthic algal community of one clear alpine lake dominated by cyanobacteria during the ice-free season and along a depth gradient using state-of-the-art analytical methods (high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). We differentiated between the epilithic cyanobacterial community and the overlying loosely attached filamentous cyanobacteria, as we expected they will have an important shielding/shading effect on the former. We hypothesised that in contrast to the case of phytoplankton, benthic cyanobacteria will show less pronounced temporal changes in MAAs concentration in response to changes in solar UV exposure. Three UV-absorbing substances were present in both types of communities, whereby all were unknown. The chemical structure of the dominant unknown substance (maximum absorption at 334 nm) resulted in the identification of a novel MAA that we named aplysiapalythine-D for its similarity to the previously described aplysiapalythine-C. Chlorophyll-a-specific MAA concentrations for epilithic and filamentous cyanobacteria showed a significant decrease with depth, although only traces were found in the former community. The temporal dynamics in MAA concentrations of filamentous cyanobacteria showed no significant variations during the ice-free season. Our result on the low temporal MAA dynamics agrees with the reduced growth rates of benthic cyanobacteria reported for cold ecosystems. The permanent presence of this community, which is adapted to the high UV levels characteristic of clear alpine lakes, probably represents the most important primary producers of these ecosystems.

We determined whether fitz bew vocalizations of the endangered Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) showed vocal individuality, assessed the differences in vocal individuality among three populations, and tested the ability of predictive vocalization models to reidentify individuals. Fitz bew vocalizations were recorded from two populations in Arizona (Roosevelt Lake and San Pedro River) and one in California (Kern River). Individuality was determined using discriminant function analysis (DFA) and trained artificial neural networks (ANN). Southwestern Willow Flycatchers showed individuality in the fitz bew, with the models correctly classifying 81-86% of the vocalizations. We also found population-level variations: vocal structure differed substantially between Roosevelt Lake and Kern River, but vocal structure in the San Pedro River population overlapped with that of the other two populations. These population differences could be related to dispersal patterns of adults or offspring, patterns of territory establishment, or habitat structure differences. The ANN vocalization models reidentified an average of 81% of the individuals and were able to identify novel individuals. On the basis of these results, we recommend that acoustic tracking should complement rather than replace current monitoring practices, given its logistical limitations. We provide a basic understanding of vocal parameters that can be used in the future to study different aspects related to vocal individuality (e.g., taxonomic, seasonal, yearly, and sex differences).

ANTIQUITY												Pre-Bronze Age human impacts on the East Mediterranean environment have been hard to detect in pollen diagrams and other off-site contexts. New evidence shows that despite a relatively rapid post-glacial wetting-up of the climate, the re-advance of oak woodland across Southwest Asia was slow. Among the factors likely to have contributed to the apparent disjunction between climate and vegetation is Neolithic landscape management, particularly through regular use of late-season ground fires to encourage grasses at the expense of trees and shrubs.																			0003-598X					DEC	2002	76	294					1002	1010		10.1017/S0003598X0009181X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003598X0009181X													WOS:000179971600025

Murray River water input usually generated diatom assemblages dominated by Aulacoseira species. After isolation, the diatom flora of two wetlands shifted to assemblages of small Fragilariaceae forms. Elevated nutrient levels corresponded with the appearance of eutraphentic taxa such as Cyclotella meneghiniana, Eolimna subminuscula, Luticola mutica and Nitzschia palea. Further evapoconcentration induced shifts to taxa tolerant of elevated salinity levels including Amphora coffeaeformis, Navicula incertata, Staurophora salina and Tryblionella hungarica. Ordination analyses reveal a strong chemical control on the diatom taxa present in the wetlands, in accordance with known ecological preferences for salinity and nutrients. The influence of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in controlling diatom assemblages was subordinate to salinity once conductivity values exceeded 1400 muS cm(-1). The results of such biomonitoring provide a means of interpreting wetland history from fossil assemblages contained in sediment sequences.

The dominance of desmids in tropical monomictic lakes (SE Brazil)	LIMNETICA												Disturbance is a concept used to explain the structure of communities. This concept emphasizes the effects of disturbance on the "break" of biomass stability in stable environments and the opportunities for the development of other species. The major disturbances in natural warm monomictic lakes include the contrasting effects of seasonal changes and long-term in thermal stability, as well as short-term changes in the mixing layer. This study investigated the effects of disturbance and abiotic environmental factors on the biomass of desmids, based on samples collected monthly from January 2002 through December 2006 in the limnetic region of two natural lakes, Carioca (small and shallow) and Dom Helvecio (large and deep), located in Rio Doce State Park, Minas Gerais State, southeast Brazil. At Lake Dom Helvecio, the extensive banks of aquatic macrophytes, the lake's dendritic shape and the period of clear water produced higher richness values and facilitated the occurrence of relatively large (maximum linear dimension >20 mu m) desmid species, primarily species belonging to Staurastrum and Staurodesmus. In contrast, less richness and a dominant group of relatively small (maximum linear dimension <20 mu m) desmid species, especially species belonging to the genus Cosmarium, were observed at Lake Carioca in conjunction with a sparse macrophyte cover. The lakes showed a seasonal thermal stratification characterized by high temperature (25-32 degrees C), thermal stability and higher desmid biomass. The stability of the epilimnetic desmid biomass was an indicator of the adaptive flexibility of the desmid species and the capacity of the biomass to recover after the mixing period.

Hence, we relate the observations Forbes made to our own microcosm, Lake Krankesjon in southern Sweden, that has been intensively studied by several research groups for more than three decades. Specifically, we focus on the question: Have we made any significant progress or did Forbes and colleagues blaze the trail through the unknown wilderness and we are mainly paving that intellectual road? We conclude that lakes are more isolated than many other biomes, but have, indeed, many extensions, for example, input from the catchment, fishing and fish migration. We also conclude that irrespective of whether lakes should be viewed as microcosms or not, the paper by Forbes has been exceptionally influential and still is, especially since it touches upon almost all aspects of the lake ecosystem, from individual behaviour to food web interactions and environmental issues. Therefore, there is no doubt that even if 125 years have passed, Forbes' paper still is a source of inspiration and deserves to be read. Hence, although aquatic ecology has made considerable progress over the latest century, Forbes might be viewed as one of the major pioneers and visionary scientists of limnology.					; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2013	47	2					125	135		10.1007/s10452-013-9435-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-013-9435-2													WOS:000319747800002

Bacterial Communities' Structure in a High mountain lake during the ice-free season: cultural and PCR-TGGE investigations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												"La Caldera" is a high mountain lake located in Sierra Nevada, Spain. For its position and characteristics it is considered as an important "sensor" for global changes. Water samples were collected during the ice-free season in order to observe changes in the bacterial community structure. Experiments were carried out complementing culture and culture-independent methods. Strong variations of the bacterial communities were recorded along the sampling period in particular regarding number and phylogenetic relationships of the microorganisms detected. At the season beginning, bacterial counts were rather high but strains belonged only to beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria. By contrast, in the middle of the season, possibly due to external inputs, total number of bacteria decreased but other phylogenetic groups, such as alpha-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicute appeared. On the whole, Proteobacteria were the dominant microbiota. Bacterial diversity and presence of most abundant species were analysed by PCR-TGGE. Sequencing of TGGE bands confirmed that prevalent Bacteria populations were evolutively close to Proteobacteria with predominance of alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria. Analysis of diversity and functional organization suggested that "La Caldera" bacterial microbiota, typical of oligotrophic and/or extreme environments with low habitability, was characterized by a community organized in an adequate distribution of dominant and resilient species. Although rather specialized, the community presented a sufficient functionality and flexibility to react to changing and stressing conditions. However, along the ice-free season, the community evolved showing more specialized populations with less adaptation abilities. This is the first work complementing cultural and cultural-independent methods for the "La Caldera" lake.

Breeding Ecology of Birds at Teshekpuk Lake: A Key Habitat Site on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska	ARCTIC												The Teshekpuk Lake Special Area in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPR-A) currently has no long-term protection from oil development. In this study, we provide novel information on nest density, productivity, and habitat use at Teshekpuk relative to a developed oilfield site at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, to assess the importance of Teshekpuk for tundra-nesting birds and to provide recommendations regarding potential oil development. Mean annual nest density of all bird species combined was significantly higher at Teshekpuk than at Prudhoe Bay and was higher than any of five other sites with comparable data on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. Nest densities were significantly higher at Teshekpuk than at Prudhoe Bay for Lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus) and long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus), although those for semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) were higher at Prudhoe Bay. Total shorebird nest densities at Teshekpuk were among the highest of any sites in the region. At Teshekpuk, shorebirds nested preferentially in wet and emergent habitats, including flooded low-center polygons, non-patterned tundra, and Carex aquatilis-dominated habitats. Therefore, we recommend that future oil infrastructure placement in this region avoid these habitats. Using data collected at Teshekpuk and Prudhoe Bay from 2005 to 2008, we modeled nest survivorship for 11 shorebird species and for Lapland longspurs. For longspurs, the best-supported models based on AIC(c) values indicated that nest survival was always higher at Teshekpuk, but it was also higher elsewhere in years of high lemming abundance and later in the nesting season. For shorebirds, the best-supported models indicated that nest survivorship was highly variable among years and sites. Uniparental-nesting shorebirds had lower nest survivorship shortly after nest initiation followed by a rapid increase, while biparental survivorship was consistently high throughout the nest lifetime. We recommend that disturbances to nesting habitat be minimized during early June, when vulnerability to nest failure is higher. Because of their high importance to Arctic breeding birds, we recommend that areas within the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area, including our study area and those that are currently under 10-year deferral, be considered for permanent protection.

Controlling Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass) with live willow stakes:: A density-dependent response	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												We tested the use of live willow stakes to manage reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) invasions on a wetland site. We planted willow at densities of 0.60 m (2 ft) centers, 0.91 m (3 ft) centers, 1.21 m (4 ft) centers, and control (no plantings) on a sloping wetland edge at Lake Washington, Seattle, U.S.A., where reed canarygrass dominated prior to the experiment. Soil moisture content was measured along the slope gradient, resulting in three soil moisture classes per replicate. Willow leaf area index and reed canarygrass aboveground biomass were measured after each of two consecutive growing seasons and analyzed using ANCOVA. Relative to the controls, the willows reduced total biomass of reed canarygrass by 44.9% with 0.60 m spacing in the first year and by 68.0% with 0.60 m spacing and 56.1% with 0.91 m spacing in the second year. Differences in soil moisture did not affect reed canarygrass aboveground biomass or effects of willow on reed canarygrass, but did affect willow growth, perhaps through reed canarygrass competition under lower soil moisture conditions. We recommend the 0.60 and 0.91m spacings for wetland restoration projects attempting to manage reed canarygrass through live willow staking. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Unabated schistosomiasis transmission in Erinle River Dam, Osun State, Nigeria: evidence of neglect of environmental effects of development projects	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH												The status of Schistosoma haematobium infection around Erinle Dam in Osun State, Nigeria, was investigated 10 years after the disease was first reported in the area. School children in two rural communities (Ilie and Oba-Ile) were examined for infection and the lake surveyed for snail intermediate host species between March 2000 and February 2001. Overall infection rate among 320 children examined in both communities was 46.6% (52.3% in Ilie and 43.0% in Oba-Ile). Mean intensity of infection ranged between 144.2 +/- 389 and 156.5 +/- 378 eggs per 10 ml urine in Ilie and Oba-Ile respectively (overall: 148.8 +/- 378 eggs per 10 ml urine). Prevalence and intensity were comparable in both communities and between boys and girls, but varied significantly (P < 0.05) with age. Bulinus globosus identified by a previous study as the local intermediate host species was found to be abundant in the lake and occurred throughout the year, in contrast to seasonal occurrence reported previously. Both prevalence and intensity of infection also increased significantly over the levels reported 10 years earlier. These results are clear indications that transmission has remained unabated in the lake during the period. The need for urgent and effective national control programme to reduce the public health importance of schistosomiasis in Erinle and other dams in Nigeria was discussed.																			1360-2276					JUN	2006	11	6					843	850		10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01628.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01628.x								16772006					WOS:000238864500010

Temporal Trend Analyses of Alpine Data Using North American Regional Reanalysis and In Situ Data: Temperature, Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Derived Blowing Snow	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Across the globe, wind speed trends have shown a slight decline for in situ meteorological datasets. Yet few studies have assessed long-term wind speed trends for alpine regions or how such trends could influence snow transport and distribution. Alpine-region meteorological stations are sparsely distributed, and their records are short. To increase spatial and temporal coverage, use of modeled data is appealing, but the level of agreement between modeled and in situ data is unknown for alpine regions. Data agreement, temporal trends, and the potential effects on snow distribution were evaluated using two in situ sites in an alpine region [Niwot Ridge in Colorado and the Glacier Lakes Ecological Experiments Station (GLEES) in Wyoming] and the corresponding grid cells of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Temperature, precipitation, and wind speed variables were used to assess blowing-snow trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales. The correlation between NARR and in situ datasets showed that temperature data were correlated but that wind speed and precipitation were not. NARR wind speed data were systematically lower when compared with in situ data, yet the frequency of wind events was captured. Overall, there were not many significant differences between NARR and in situ wind speed trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales, aside from GLEES daily values. This finding held true even when trends presented opposite signatures and slopes, which was likely a result of low trend slopes. The lack of agreement between datasets prohibited the use of NARR to broaden analyses for blowing-snow dynamics in alpine regions.

On-orbit calibration is an essential part of the instrument calibration strategy, but on-board beam-filling targets are not practical for such large apertures. Therefore, areas to serve as vicarious calibration targets need to be identified. Such sites can only be identified through field experiments including both in situ and airborne measurements. For this purpose, two field experiments were performed in central Australia. Three areas are studied as follows: 1) Lake Eyre, a typically dry salt lake; 2) Wirrangula Hill, with sparse vegetation and a dense cover of surface rock; and 3) Simpson Desert, characterized by dry sand dunes. Of those sites, only Wirrangula Hill and the Simpson Desert are found to be potentially suitable targets, as they have a spatial variation in brightness temperatures of <4 K under normal conditions. However, some limitations are observed for the Simpson Desert, where a bias of 15 K in vertical and 20 K in horizontal polarization exists between model predictions and observations, suggesting a lack of understanding of the underlying physics in this environment. Subsequent comparison with model predictions indicates a SMOS bias of 5 K in vertical and 11 K in horizontal polarization, and an unbiased root mean square difference of 10 K in both polarizations for Wirrangula Hill. Most importantly, the SMOS observations show that the brightness temperature evolution is dominated by regular seasonal patterns and that precipitation events have only little impact.					; Walker, Jeffrey/D-2624-2009; Kerr, Yann/Z-2432-2019; Barrett, Damian/C-7972-2009	KIM, Edward J./0000-0002-9828-4624; Walker, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4817-2712; Rudiger, Christoph/0000-0003-4375-4446; Hacker, Jorg/0000-0002-3458-3465													0196-2892	1558-0644				MAR	2014	52	3					1749	1760		10.1109/TGRS.2013.2254121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2254121													WOS:000329404800019

Reproduction of the Plains Garter Snake, Thamnophis radix, Near Its Northern Range Limit: More Evidence for a "Fast" Life History	COPEIA												Do high-latitude environments constrain life histories of ectotherms? One expectation is that shorter and cooler active seasons at high latitudes limit opportunities for maintenance of optimum body temperature and restrict time for foraging and therefore for growth and reproduction. Thus, under this hypothesis, individuals in high-latitude populations of wide-ranging species would be predicted to grow more slowly, have lower reproductive output, and perhaps reproduce less frequently than lower-latitude conspecifics. However, at Miquelon Lake in central Alberta, the Plains Garter Snake (Thamnophis radix) grows as fast annually as more southerly conspecifics and reaches sexual maturity at the same age. Here, we make a comparable test of latitudinal variation in reproductive traits. Both litter size and offspring size were larger in the Miquelon Lake population than at lower latitudes. Moreover, female snakes could reproduce annually, although the frequency of annual reproduction remains unknown. Litter size was positively related to female size, but also varied annually, apparently in relation to the previous year's weather (higher litter size with lower rainfall and higher temperature the previous year); the most parsimonious interpretation of this observation is that warm, sunny weather facilitates the acquisition of capital resources for the subsequent year's reproduction. Overall, the Miquelon Lake snakes appear to have a 'fast' life history, presumably as a result of a productive environment that provides an abundance of anurans, which constitute the primary prey of T. radix at this site, but this hypothesis is untested.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				MAR	2014		1					130	135		10.1643/CH-13-119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CH-13-119													WOS:000337265700016

Synoptic-Scale Environments Conducive to Orographic Impacts on Cold-Season Surface Wind Regimes at Montreal, Quebec	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Orographic wind channeling, defined as dynamically and thermally induced processes that force wind to blow along the axis of a valley, is a common occurrence along the St. Lawrence River Valley (SLRV) in Quebec, Canada, and produces substantial observed weather impacts at stations along the valley, including Montreal (CYUL). Cold-season observed north-northeast (n = 55) and south-southeast (n = 16) surface wind events at CYUL are identified from 1979 to 2002. The authors partition the north-northeast wind events into four groups using manual synoptic typing. Types A and D ("inland cyclone" and "northwestern cyclone") are associated with strong lower-tropospheric geostrophic warm-air advection and near-surface pressure-driven channeling of cold air from the north-northeast, along the axis of the SLRV. Type C ("anticyclone") shows no evidence of a surface cyclone and thus is the least associated with inclement weather at CYUL, whereas type B ("coastal cyclone") is associated with predominantly forced wind channeling along the SLRV. Type D of the north-northeast wind events and all south-southeast wind events exhibit similar sea level pressure patterns. The respective magnitudes of the pressure gradients in the Lake Champlain Valley south of CYUL and the SLRV play a large role in determining the favored wind direction. Soundings of the various event types illustrate substantial differences in temperature structure, with a large near-surface temperature inversion particularly prevalent in north-northeast events. The results of this study may provide guidance in forecasting winds, temperatures, and observed weather in and around the SLRV, given certain synoptic-scale regimes.

Fish exposure to Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn was estimated on the basis of calculated free metal ion concentrations in lake waters. Hepatic metal concentrations were determined and various markers of oxidative stress were measured to assess metal effects in liver cells. Accumulated metals were not consistently related to ambient free metal ion concentrations, possibly because of unaccounted for fluctuations in lake water metal concentrations. Accumulated metals were associated with limited oxidative stress in perch livers, as evidenced by reductions in glutathione concentrations and glutathione reductase activities. However, this stress appeared to be minor, since increasing hepatic Cu concentrations were associated with reduced lipid peroxidation, a response opposite to that predicted from basic principles. Our results suggest that oxidative stress will not have direct repercussions on the health of the perch at the individual level. We speculate that the observed increase in metallothionein concentrations with increasing accumulated metals might afford protection against reactive oxygen species.

ELA experienced a cyclical wet-dry-wet pattern from 1968 to 1998, with the early 1970s and 1990s having above-average precipitation and the 1980s being a period of drought with a 2 degrees C increase in air temperature. During this drought, the length of ice-free season, duration of stratification, depth of the euphotic zone, and light extinction increased while precipitation and nutrient inputs to the lakes decreased. Phytoplankton assemblages of four study lakes were temporally coherent. During the drought, phytoplankton biomass and the number of phytoplankton species increased despite decreased nutrient inputs. There was a noticeable shift in species composition to greater abundances of dinoflagellates and large chrysophytes-mixotrophic species capable of cycling through the deeper, lower light, high-nutrient waters, presumably to consume bacteria as an alternative to autotrophic production. These species have slow turnover times; therefore, suspended nutrients were held in the water column for a longer period of time. Phytoplankton photosynthesis was less responsive.																			0024-3590					NOV	2001	46	7					1784	1793		10.4319/lo.2001.46.7.1784	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.7.1784													WOS:000172131900020
J	Marriot, SB; Wright, VP				Marriot, SB; Wright, VP			Mudrock deposition in an ancient dryland system: Moor Cliffs Formation, Lower Old Red Sandstone, southwest Wales, UK	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Studies of the lowermost Old Red Sandstone of South Wales (Pridolian-Lochkovian) have revealed that the mudstones that constitute up to 80% of some of the formations have been deposited in a variety of environments. In addition there is a variety of lithofacies associations present in some mud-dominated units that suggests diverse mechanisms of deposition. This paper considers the Moor Cliffs Formation and examines four distinct mudrock facies. The overall depositional environment is considered to have been a multi-stage, multi-channel system, similar to a modern dryland river system, with mud-dominated, moderately sinuous ephemeral rivers that reworked muddy floodplain sediment over a proximal braidplain during seasonal flooding. The alluvial deposits were pedified to varying degrees as calcic Vertisols, which, due to seasonal wetting and drying, provided soil aggregates for reworking by wind and water as sand- or silt-sized pellets. Very infrequent flooding events (superfloods) resulted in extensive stripping of the floodplain surface and the introduction of allochthonous sand sheet deposits over wide areas in this normally sediment-starved system. Depressions (pans or waterholes) on the floodplain formed ephemeral lakes following floods, and acted as sediment traps for dust from the frequent dust storms occurring in the system.

Our reconstructions are based on a multi-proxy approach including microfacies analysis, X-ray fluorescence core scanning, radionuclide dating (Pb-210, Cs-137, and Am-241), and palynological analysis (pollen, spores, and dinoflagellate cysts). A 131 -cm-long composite record that encompasses the past c. 300 years reveals 181 varves of endogenic and mixed clastic-biogenic types. The formation of these varves was controlled by seasonal variability in clastic input and primary productivity. The non-varved intervals consist of homogenous lake sediments and turbidite deposits. Based on a chronology developed through radionuclide dating, varve counting and exclusion of turbidites from the sequence, we have compared our proxy data with meteorological data and historical records of earthquakes and human activities. Our results suggest that the surroundings of Lake Vouliagmeni experienced relatively wet conditions during the late solar Maunder Minimum (1645-1715 AD) and relatively dry conditions during the Dalton Minimum (1790-1830 AD), which highlights the hydroclimatic heterogeneity in SE Europe during the Little Ice Age. The evaluation of historical documentation suggests that the majority of the turbidites is related to lake-slope instabilities following earthquake shocks. Human impact on Lake Vouliagmeni includes (i) a change in aquatic biota following the artificial connection of the lake to the sea at c. 1880 AD, and (ii) expansion of agricultural areas and reduction of natural forests around the lake due to population growth over the past 300 years.

Movements of eels commenced at dusk, with a higher proportion of shortfinned eels moving per night than longfinned eels, and also moving greater distances. Both species often showed extensive movements immediately after tagging, but thereafter movements were limited. In the smaller stream, home ranges averaged 30 and 10 m for shortfinned and longfinned eels, respectively, but not all eels were active on every night. There were no seasonal differences in mean distances moved. In both streams, eel movement was almost exclusively bankside, and seldom cross-channel; eels also showed considerable fidelity to a particular bank. Shortfinned eels were most commonly found in runs, and longfinned eels in riffles.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				FEB	2003	66	2					143	154		10.1023/A:1023691604088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023691604088													WOS:000182583800004

Currently, both reefs are stocked and naturally reproduced lake trout aggregate at these reefs during the spawning season. Attempts to document natural reproduction of lake trout at deep-water spawning sites in southwestern Lake Michigan have been hampered, in part, by a lack of detailed information on suitable spawning habitat and imprecise placement of egg collection devices. We developed high-resolution substrate and bathy-metric maps for Julian's and Waukegan reefs using geo-referenced bathymetry readings, sidescan sonar, and underwater video. Spawning activity was evaluated at suitable and unsuitable habitat using egg traps deployed during the 2009 and 2010 spawning seasons. Sidescan sonar data allowed identification of suitable substrate at Waukegan (1%) and Julian's (2%) reefs as well as previously undocumented Waukegan South Reef (6%). Small, discrete areas with suitable spawning habitat (substrate and slope) were found and in total constituted <1% of all hard surfaces mapped at both the Waukegan Reef complex and Julian's Reef. No eggs were collected either year, due in part to difficulty sampling small, localized patches of suitable spawning habitat and extensive coverage of Dreissena and Cladophora species. In the future, use of this high-resolution habitat data combined with more precise egg or fry sampling equipment will allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of natural reproduction at these once-productive offshore reefs.

Widely accepted conceptual models indicate that this is the case both in marine and freshwater systems. In this paper we examine four case studies and test whether these models generally apply. We also identify other complex interactions among the autotrophs that may influence ecosystem response to cultural eutrophication, The marine case studies focus on macroalgae and its interactions with sediments and vascular plants. The freshwater case studies focus on interactions between phytoplankton, epiphyton, and benthic microalgae. In Waquoit Bay, MA (estuary), controlled experiments documented that blooms of macroalgae were responsible for the loss of eelgrass beds at nutrient-enriched locations. Macroalgae covered eelgrass and reduced irradiance to the extent that the plants could not maintain net growth. In Hog Island Bay, VA (estuary), a dense lawn of macroalgae covered the bottom sediments. There was reduced sediment-water nitrogen exchange when the algae were actively growing and high nitrogen release during algal senescence. In Lakes Brobo (West Africa) and Okechobee (FL), there were dramatic seasonal changes in the biomass and phosphorus content of planktonic versus attached algae, and these changes were coupled with changes in water level and abiotic turbidity. Deeper water and/or greater turbidity favored dominance by phytoplankton. In Lake Brobo there also was evidence that phytoplankton growth was stimulated following a die-off of vascular plants. The ease studies from Waquoit Bay and Lake Okeechobee support conceptual models of succession from vascular plants to benthic algae to phytoplankton along gradients of increasing nutrients and decreasing underwater irradiance. The case studies from Hog Island Bay and Lake Brobo illustrate additional effects (modified sediment-water nutrient fluxes, allelopathy or nutrient release during plant senescence) that could Flay a role in ecosystem response to nutrient stress.

Here, we tested this hypothesis using a zooplankton dataset from the Araguaia River floodplain, Central Brazil. Data on zooplankton abundance and environmental variables (pH, water temperature, conductivity, turbidity, transparency, depth and concentrations of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a) were collected at 30 sites in January (high water period) and July 2006 (low water period). For each site, we used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity coefficient to measure temporal beta diversity (between January and July 2006), while the standardized Euclidean distance was used to calculate the temporal environmental variability. Then, we tested the hypothesis that temporal beta diversity would be higher in habitats that underwent larger variation in environmental conditions using a Pearson correlation analysis. We found a positive correlation between temporal beta diversity and environmental variability (r = 0.46; P = 0.043). Furthermore, we found that temporal beta diversity was mainly driven by an increase in zooplankton abundance between high and low water periods.

We suggest that future studies should search for correlates of temporal beta diversity (such as environmental variability) in other highly seasonal systems.

To determine the water's hydrochemical composition and the water quality of Bosten Lake, analyses of the spatial distribution, water pollution status and irrigation suitability were conducted with statistical methods, including redundancy and factor analyses, inverse distance weighted interpolation, and water quality assessment and saturation index simulation of minerals in the water from a survey done in 2018. The results suggested that the average total dissolved solids (TDS) of Bosten Lake in 2018 was 1.32 g/L, and the lake is alkaline with a pH of 8.47. The strength of the water exchange capacity affected the spatial distribution of TDS. The spatial distribution of TDS and its value can be significantly changed by restoring the water supply of seasonal rivers in the northwest. The water of Bosten Lake contains sulfate and sodium groups, which are mainly affected by lake evaporation. As the pH increases, the content of carbonate ions increases, while the content of bicarbonate ions decreases. The spatial distributions of other major ions are consistent with that of the TDS. The spatial distribution of potentially toxic elements is more complicated than that of major ions. In general, the spatial distribution of Cu and As is more consistent with the spatial distribution of electrical conductivity or TDS. The spatial distributions of the Zn, Se and pH values are more consistent with respect to other variables. Although the water of Bosten Lake is still at a permissible level for water irrigation, the lake is moderately polluted, and the local site almost has a highly polluted status. The research results are of great significance for lake environmental protection and management as well as watershed ecological restoration.					; ma, long/JHU-2289-2023	Ma, Long/0000-0002-8233-8640; Liu, Wen/0000-0002-5524-0496; ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554														2073-4441				OCT	2020	12	10							2859	10.3390/w12102859	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12102859													WOS:000586980800001

How will climate change influence these climate variables and thereby affect the occurrence of fire and area burned in a deciduous forest landscape in Temiscamingue, Quebec, Canada? Location: West central Quebec and the Great Lakes-St Lawrence forest of Canada. Methods: We first used an information-theoretic framework to evaluate the relative role of different weather variables in explaining occurrence and area burned of large fires (>200 ha, 1959-1999) across the Great Lakes-St Lawrence forest region. Second, we examined how these weather variables varied historically in Temiscamingue and, third, how they may change between the present and 2100 according to different scenarios of climate change based on two Global Circulation Models. Results: Mean monthly temperature maxima during the fire season (Apr-Oct) and weighted sequences of dry spells best explained fire occurrence and area burned. Between 1910 and 2004, mean monthly temperature maxima in Temiscamingue showed no apparent temporal trend, while dry spell sequences decreased in frequency and length. All future scenarios show an increase in mean monthly temperature maxima, and one model scenario forecasts an increase in dry spell sequences, resulting in a slight increase in forecasted annual area burned. Conclusion: Despite the forecasted increase in fire activity, effects of climate change on fire will not likely affect forest structure and composition as much as natural succession or harvesting and other disturbances, principally because or the large relative difference in area affected by these processes					; Flannigan, Mike/G-6996-2015; Flannigan, Michael/G-6996-2015	Drever, Mark/0000-0001-5303-9230; Flannigan, Michael/0000-0002-9970-5363													1402-2001	1654-109X				AUG	2009	12	3					261	272		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2009.01035.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2009.01035.x													WOS:000268571000001

Occurrence of matrix-bound phosphine in intertidal sediments of the Yangtze Estuary	CHEMOSPHERE												This study investigated the levels and potential transformation of matrix-bound phosphine in the intertidal sediments (0-5 cm) of the Yangtze Estuary. Matrix-bound phosphine concentrations in sediments ranged from 0.65 to 3.25 ng kg(-1), with an annual average of 1.53 ng kg(-1). In freshwater sediments, the concentrations of matrix-bound phosphine were significantly higher than in the brackish sediments. The maximum concentrations of matrix-bound phosphine appeared in July (1.17-3.25 ng kg(-1)), followed by May (0.92-3.01 ng kg(-1)), November (0.65-2.41 ng kg(-1)) and January (0.51-1.42 ng kg(-1)). Matrix-bound phosphine derived probably from the mechanochemical reduction of apatite-bound phosphate and the microbial conversion of organic phosphorus in the intertidal sediments. its spatial and seasonal distributions, however, were regulated by salinity and sediment temperature. Compared with other aquatic systems (e.g. rivers, lakes and coastal seas). a low level of matrix-bound phosphine was observed in the intertidal sediments, probably implicating a relatively rapid turnover of phosphine in the system.

Lake sediments may provide suitable archives to decipher the history of local and regional pollution and eutrophication. Here we provide quantitative high-resolution data for the history of airborne pollutants and eutrophication from sediments of five lakes in Central Chile between ca. AD 1800-2005. We use spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) from fossil fuel combustion and excess atmospheric Cu deposition from mining activities as a proxy for atmospheric deposition. Organic carbon and nitrogen flux rates to the sediments and C/N ratios are used as a proxy for aquatic primary production and eutrophication. We show that the lake sediment SCP and Cu records are highly consistent and depict in great detail the local and regional history of urban, industrial and transportation history as reported in independent documentary sources and statistics. The pre-industrial and pre-1950 background concentrations (and flux rates) of the substances can be quantified. We can also show that technical measures taken in the early 1980s to trim down Cu emissions from the copper mines reduced the excess atmospheric Cu fallout to the lakes by about 50%. Eutrophication of the lakes did not start before ca. 1980. Prior to that time, warm season temperatures explain most of the variance in TOC and N flux to the sediments. The three dimictic lakes show only moderate eutrophication responses to enhanced N supply (as atmospheric fallout; enrichment factors for TOC and N 1.1-2.6), suggesting that mainly phosphorus controls aquatic primary production. The meromictic lake, where phosphorus recycling is likely, shows the largest response (enrichment factors for TOC and N between 9-20). While all five lakes show overall consistent and similar trends for the pollution history during the 19th and 20th century, there are significant differences in the details of the individual profiles. This suggests that local sources are highly important and the common regional (background) signal is relatively marginal. This is very different from Europe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Fish distribution and diet in relation to the invasive macrophyte Lagarosiphon major in the littoral zone of Lake Dunstan, New Zealand	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Invasive macrophytes are usually associated with negative impacts on habitat quality and a threat to native biodiversity. However, they might provide the same beneficial functions of native macrophytes, i.e., the provision of food and shelter for fish, in the absence of native macrophytes. To assess the value of the invasive macrophyte Lagarosiphon major as a fish habitat, we investigated the spatio-temporal variation in the distribution of a small littoral fish species (common bully) in the littoral of Lake Dunstan, a New Zealand hydro lake. Large- and fine-scale common bully distribution could partly be explained by the occurrence of dense L. major stands. Additionally, variability in catch per unit effort was partly explained by season and recruitment. Diet analysis indicated that common bullies in the Lagarosiphon-dominated littoral fed on invertebrates (Mollusca, Trichoptera, Chironomidae) found on exotic L. major, therefore suggesting its role as a food provider in the system. These results indicated that invasive macrophytes can provide important ecosystem functions in disturbed habitats that are otherwise devoid of native macrophytes. Any macrophyte management strategy should therefore carefully consider the costs and benefits associated with macrophyte control.					; Bickel, Tobias/AAR-8745-2020; Closs, Gerard/AAE-5883-2019	Bickel, Tobias/0000-0003-2692-3391; Closs, Gerard/0000-0003-4550-6024													0906-6691					MAR	2008	17	1					10	19		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00249.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00249.x													WOS:000252711800002

These temperature changes may adversely affect aquatic ecosystems especially by contributing to the decline of wildlife populations and habitat destruction. Any practice that affects the equilibrium of an aquatic environment may alter the temperature of that environment and subsequently cause thermal pollution. There may be some positive effects, though, to thermal pollution, including the extension of fishing seasons and rebounding of some wildlife populations. Thermal pollution may come in the form of warm or cold water being dumped into a lake, river, or ocean. Increased sediment build-up in a body of water affects its turbidity or cloudiness and may decrease its depth, both of which may cause a rise in water temperature. Increased sun exposure may also raise water temperature. Dams may change a river habitat into a lake habitat by creating a reservoir (man-made lake) behind the dam. The reservoir water temperature is often colder than the original stream or river. The sources and causes of thermal pollution are varied, which makes it difficult to calculate the extent of the problem. Because the thermal pollution caused by Hydropower Plants (HPPs) may not directly affect human health, it is neglected in general. Therefore, sources and results of thermal pollution in HPPs are ignored in general. This paper aimed to reveal the causes and results of thermal pollution and measures to be taken in HPPs.																					978-3-319-16024-5; 978-3-319-16023-8				2015							19	32		10.1007/978-3-319-16024-5_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16024-5_2													WOS:000380565300002

Decomposition of Egeria densa Planchon (Hydrocharitaceae) in a well oxygenated tropical aquatic ecosystem	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The aims of this study were to evaluate the decomposition rate (K-T) of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Egeria densa Planchon and measure the associated nutrients release, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Additionally, we compared the effects of microorganisms alone versus microorganisms plus invertebrates on the decomposition process. The experiment was performed using two mesh litter bags (45 mu m for microbial activity only and 2 mm for microbial and invertebrate activity) during two distinct periods: the dry season, September to November of 2003, and the rainy season, January to February of 2004 in the Campelo Lake (Northern of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). The K(T)s, calculated using a single exponential model, were higher in the 45 mu m mesh bags in the dry season and in the 2 mm mesh in the rainy season (dry K-T: 45 mu m=0.0384, 2 mm=0.0355; rainy K-T: 45 mu m=0.0483, 2 mm=0.0666), when higher temperatures (rainy season similar to 30 degrees C; dry season similar to 25 degrees C) were observed. The half-life of the E. densa detritus ranged from 14 to 27 days. The action of microorganisms was the main process causing the decomposition of E. densa in the Campelo Lake, as shown by the decomposition rate of the 45 mu m mesh bags. However, invertebrates were important for the fragmentation, catabolism and leaching processes within the detritus contained in the 2 mm litter bags, accelerating its degradation, especially during the rainy season. The accelerated loss of chemical compounds such as nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus in the remaining detritus throughout the decomposition process stresses the importance of the decomposition process for the rapid nutrient cycling in the Campelo Lake and for the maintenance of high primary productivity.					; Suzuki, Marina/J-3387-2014	Suzuki, Marina Satika/0000-0001-6948-6019; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2015	74	2					278	285		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.1013	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.1013													WOS:000355151500007

Pore a ater sulfate, total mercury concentrations, and organic matter C/N ratios showed no relation ships with microbial community structure. Seasonal changes and changes potentially attributable to temperature regulation of bacterial membranes were detectable but were less important influences on sediment PLFA composition than were differences due to lake sampling location. Analysis of biomarker PLFAs characteristic of Desulfobacter and Desulfovibrio groups of sulfate-reducing bacteria suggests that Desulfobacter-like organisms are important mercury methylators in the sediments, especially in the Lower Arm of Clear Lake.

DISTRIBUTION MODEL OF SHRIMP SPECIES IN LAKE NOKOUe, SOUTHERN BENIN, WEST AFRICA	CRUSTACEANA												The aim of this work was to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of shrimp species in the Lake Nokoue-Cotonou Channel complex for an efficient management of the fishery. The results of one year sampling from five stations (North, South, East, Central and West) in the complex revealed the following proportions: Penaeus notialis 73.68%, Macrobrachium macrobra-chion 13.81%, Macrobrachium vollenhovenii 5.36%, Penaeus monodon 2.68%, Macrobrachium felicinum 2.20%, Penaeus kerathurus 1.72%, Macrobrachium cf. zariquieyi 0.27%, and Macro -brachium equidens 0.27%. The species M. cf. zariquieyi and M. equidens were never reported from Benin, but are now found in Lake Nokoue. Spatially, Penaeus (Penaeus notialis) are more abundant in the west (Acadja concentration zone), while Macrobrachium (Macrobrachium macrobrachion) are more dominant in the east (near the Oueme entrance) and north (near the So entrance) of the lake. Penaeus are strongly present in the lagoon complex from January to August, while Macrobrachium are more abundant in Lake Nokoue from September to December. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that increasing salinity, pH, transparency and total dissolved solids (TDS) positively influ-enced the abundance of P. notialis, while increasing salinity, pH, transparency, and TDS negatively influenced the abundance of M. macrobrachion at the 5% significance level. For an efficient man-agement of the shrimp fishery, it is desirable that the shrimp fishery in Lake Nokoue, mainly in the Cotonou Channel, which is a very sensitive area for their seasonal migrations, benefits from at least three months of respite per year, from November to January. This period corresponds to the strong migration of juvenile Penaeus towards the lake. This should allow many Penaeus to grow up and breed at least once in their lives, according to the species life cycle presented.					; SINTONDJI, Wilfried/JQW-6202-2023; SINTONDJI, Selome Wilfried/JQW-6202-2023	GODOME, Theophile/0000-0001-5961-0637; Lacroix, Genevieve/0000-0002-3227-0000; SINTONDJI, Selome Wilfried/0000-0002-8720-8650													0011-216X	1568-5403				JUL	2023	96	7					605	625		10.1163/15685403-bja10304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-bja10304													WOS:001046623500001

Taking Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China, as an example, this paper evaluated the influence of hydrological seasons on the relationship between land use and water quality under different hydrological buffers. It was shown that the contribution of land use to the spatial variation of water quality is approximately 30%. In addition, the explanatory ability was greatest in the average season while it was smaller in the dry and wet seasons. Land uses showed scale effects; at a smaller scale, urban areas, agricultural land and water areas were the most important land uses affected by water quality. As the buffers changed from 500 to 1500 m, the impact of urban areas decreased significantly, while that of agricultural land and water areas increased rapidly; however, when the buffer was greater than 1000 m, the explanatory ability of water areas did not increase further but remained stable. Green space is only significant at the 200 m and 500 m scales, which showed the effect of improving river quality. This study is expected to provide references for future decision making of urban construction, environmental planning and management.

J	Zhang, H; Wang, YY; Xu, J				Zhang, Huan; Wang, Yuyu; Xu, Jun			Influence of Seasonal Water Level Fluctuations on Food Web Structure of a Large Floodplain Lake in China	SUSTAINABILITY												Seasonal shifts in hydrology are known to alter the abundance and diversity of basal production resources and habitats and hence strongly influence the structure and function of river ecosystems. However, equivalent knowledge of natural lake ecosystems in floodplain regions is lacking. Here, we used stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen to assess available primary production sources and consumer taxa during the dry and wet seasons in a large floodplain lake connected to the Yangtze River. Fish species showed distinct & delta;C-13 values between two hydrological periods but only small changes in & delta;N-15 values. Most of the fish species had higher estimated trophic levels in the dry season, likely indicating greater carnivory. Results of Bayesian mixing models revealed that benthic algae and benthic organic matter (BOM), combined with C-3 vegetation, were the principal food sources supporting the biomass of most fish species during the low-water period, whereas benthic algae and seston were the most important carbon sources during the flood period. Overall, these findings demonstrate that seasonal hydrological changes, such as water-level fluctuations, can affect the trophic structure and ecosystem functioning of floodplain lake food webs in the subtropical zone.

Scanning micro-X-ray fluorescence elemental mapping: A new tool for the study of laminated sediment records	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												The utility of elemental mapping by scanning X- ray fluorescence ( XRF) in the study of annual laminated sedimentary records was investigated on eight annually laminated sediment types. The examples were chosen to illustrate the potential of this approach in environments dominated by terrigenous, biological and chemical deposition. Individual laminae were identifiable in elemental maps of all sediment types and were enhanced through the use of data reduction techniques ( e. g., principal components transformation). Laminae were least apparent in clastic dominated systems with no seasonal changes in sediment sources. In biologically dominated systems, element maps provided insights into the composition of the varve subcomponents, related to alternating terrigenous and biologically dominated seasonal periods of deposition. Chemically precipitated structures were more prevalent than expected from visual investigations alone and may provide an underutilized paleoenvironmental signature of changing limnological conditions. Elemental mapping offers a valuable tool for the study of laminated records that complements existing techniques ( e. g., SEM, digital image analysis).

Environ. 27a (16) (1993) 2645) to characterize non-urban daily 8-h maximum ozone (O-3) concentrations within the eastern United States for the O-3 seasons of 1993-2002. The analysis proceeds by selecting a spatially representative O-3 database, imputing missing O-3 concentrations using a spatial interpolation scheme, applying a rotated principal components analysis to delineate spatial regions of homogeneous concentrations, and investigating the temporal patterns exhibited by concentrations in each of the regions. Spatially, the analysis divides the eastern United States into five regions: a Northeast region, a Great Lakes Region, a Mid-Atlantic region, a Southwest region, and a Florida region. Concentrations are near the domain average for the Northeast, Great Lakes, and Southwest regions, are highest in the Mid-Atlantic region, and are lowest in the Florida region. Within each region the temporal patterns (e.g., seasonal trends, persistency; and annual trends) Of O-3 concentrations were quite different. The Northeast, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic regions display a moderate amount of seasonal variability with peak concentrations occurring in late July, late June, and late July time periods, respectively. Conversely, the Southwest region exhibits a small amount of seasonal variability with peak concentrations occurring in late August, and the Florida region exhibits a relatively large amount of seasonal variability with peak concentrations occurring during the months of April and May. Ozone concentrations are most persistent in the Florida and Southwest regions (3-4 days of persistence), less persistent in the Mid Atlantic region (2-3 days of persistence), and least persistent in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions (I or 2 days persistence). These results demonstrate the spatial and temporal variability Of O-3 concentrations in the eastern United States and indicate that regional characterization (e.g., through aggregation Of Clusters of monitors) Of O-3 air quality may be a powerful yet simplifying air quality metric for determining seasonal trends, annual trends, and a variety of other O-3 concentration characteristics.

There is an urgent demand for a highly sensitive and specific quantitative detection method that can be combined with a high sample processing capability in order to increase sampling frequency. In this study, we sequenced 36 cyanobacterial 16S rRNA genes (partial), complete intergenic transcribed spacers (ITS), and 23S rRNA genes (partial) of fresh-water cyanobacteria found in New Zealand. The sequences were used to develop an A. planktonica specific TaqMan QPCR assay targeting the long ITS1-L and the 5 terminus of the 23S rRNA gene. The QPCR method was linear (R-2=0.999) over seven orders of magnitude with a lower end sensitivity of approximately five A. planktonica cells in the presence of exogenous DNA. The quantitative PCR (QPCR) method was used to assess the spatial distribution and seasonal population dynamics of A. planktonica from the Lower Karori Reservoir (Wellington, New Zealand) over a five-month period. The QPCR results were compared directly to microscopic cell counts and found to correlate significantly (95% confidence level) under both bloom and non-bloom conditions. The current QPCR assay will be an invaluable tool for routine monitoring programs and in research investigating environmental factors that regulate the population dynamics and the blooming of A. planktonica.

High-altitude lakes in the Yunnan Plateau are exposed to high intensities of UVR and contain low concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Thirty-eight lakes in the Yunnan Plateau with elevations from 1291 to 3809m above sea level were investigated to study CDOM concentrations and possible effects of UVR on the lake ecosystem. The attenuation of UVR in the Yunnan Plateau lakes was calculated from the absorption coefficient of CDOM based on an empirical relationship from lakes in the Alps and Pyrenees mountains. Absorption coefficients [a(lambda)] at 320nm [a(320)] ranged from 0.52 to 14.05 m(-1) (mean standard deviation, 4.40 3.85 m(-1)) and at 380 nm [a(380)] from 0.05 to 4.51 m(-1) (1.40 1.30m(-1)). The exponential slope coefficient for the relationship of wavelength to a(lambda) ranged from 16.2 to 41.4 mu m(-1) (21.74 +/- 4.93 mu m(-1)) over the 280-400nm interval. Normalized fluorescence emission (NFLU) at 450nm from an excitation wavelength of 355 nm, F-n(355), averaged 7.93 +/- 3.22 NFLU. A significant positive relationship was found between a(355) and F,(355). The estimated diffuse attenuation coefficients of UV-B (320nm) and UV-A (380nm) ranged from 0.55 to 15.77 m(-1) and from 0.24 to 6.73 m(-1); the corresponding 1% attenuation depths ranged from 0.29 to 8.44 m and from 0.68 to 19.42 m. Twenty-five of 38 lakes had 1% UV-13 attenuation depths of 1.5 m or more. The median 1% attenuation depth was 28.8% of the sampling depth for UV-B radiation and 60% for UV-A.

These modulate the mesoscale and synoptic scale weather systems. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in weather as function of topography and season and their impact on potato crop growth. To determine how crop growth varies with elevation, we installed a network of six automatic weather stations along two transects. It covers a 30-km radius and 1800-m elevation difference. We conducted a potato field experiment near the weather stations. We used the weather observations as input for a crop model, GECROS. Data analysis showed large differences between weather in February and May. February is more dominated by mesoscale circulations. The averaged February diurnal patter shows a strong east to southeast lake breezes and, at night, weak localized flows driven by mountain density flows. In contrast, in May, the synoptic flow dominates, interacting with the mesoscale flows. The GECROS model satisfactorily predicted the elevational gradient in crop yield. Model sensitivity experiments showed that belg-averaged precipitation distribution gave the highest yield, followed by exchanging May weather observations with April.

While prior studies have shown Qinghai Lake supports one of the largest breeding areas for Bar-headed Geese, little is known regarding the species movement ecology during the breeding season. In this study, we examined Bar-headed Goose home range size within the breeding grounds at Qinghai Lake and documented their daily movement patterns and habitat selection. We also identified several key breeding sites surrounding Qinghai Lake. Our research provides valuable information on this sensitive species that could help develop the strategy for waterfowl conservation and disease control. Abstract The Bar-headed Goose is the only true goose species or Anserinae to migrate solely within the Central Asian Flyway, and thus, it is an ideal species for observing the effects of both land use and climate change throughout the flyway. In this paper, we investigate the home range, movement pattern, and habitat selection of Bar-headed Geese (Anser indicus) during the breeding season at Qinghai Lake, which is one of their largest breeding areas and a major migration staging area in the flyway. We identified several areas used by the geese during the breeding season along the shoreline of Qinghai Lake and found that most geese had more than one core use area and daily movements that provided insight into their breeding activity. We also observed the intensive use of specific wetlands and habitats near Qinghai Lake. These data provide interesting insights into the movement ecology of this important species and also provide critical information for managers seeking to understand and respond to conservation concerns threatening Bar-headed Geese, such as landscape and habitat changes.

Freshwater ecosystems of the southern region of the russian far east are undergoing extreme environmental change	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												The freshwater ecosystems of the Southern Region Of the Russian Far East (SRORFE) are subject to the influence of environmental extremes (especially heavy floods and droughts). Within forested areas, extreme floods do not destroy the ecosystems of rivers and floodplain lakes; in contrast, periodic medium and small floods alternating with low-flow periods are beneficial to these ecosystems. In the 21st century, the natural flood cycles will change, likely increasing the peaks of floods but decreasing the probability of rain during the dry season. Extreme floods can lead to the rapid depletion of river phytoplankton and zoobenthos and can cause long-term water hyper-eutrophication. Droughts will increase the probability of forest fires. The loss of forest cover due to logging and fires will intensify the unsteadiness of hydrological regimes of water bodies. In the SRORFE global environmental change, accompanied by increasing anthropogenic pressures and a lack of protective measures will cause a significant loss of biodiversity among freshwater biota. Meanwhile, forest preservation will ease the negative effects on the biodiversity and productivity of freshwater ecosystems in the SRORFE.																			1961-9502						2016		417							34	10.1051/kmae/2016021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2016021													WOS:000390394000033

A comprehensive cartographic approach to evacuation map creation for Hurricane Ike in Galveston County, Texas	CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE												Hurricane evacuation maps raise awareness of the risks associated with potential inundation from storm surge and provide evacuation route information to residents leaving their residences for safety. To create the most effective hurricane evacuation map for communicating risk to the public, cartographic best practices must be integrated into the evacuation map visualization. This study addresses a current gap in the scientific literature by integrating cartographic best practices for color choice, symbol choice, and positive messaging, together with a complete GIS-based workflow utilizing LiDAR-derived digital elevation models, Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) storm surge products, and vector shapefiles for creating hurricane evacuation maps. To evaluate the methodology, the primary study site was Galveston County, Texas, during Hurricane Ike in September 2008. The typical workflow for county and municipal emergency managers is to create pre-hurricane season generalized evacuation maps. This study shows that the probabilistic storm surge SLOSH forecasts can be seamlessly implemented in the 72-48hours prior to a storm surge event to provide specialized evacuation maps that incorporate hurricane-specific parameters and more accurately show risk to residents. To verify the Hurricane Ike workflow, a secondary study site in Harrison County, Mississippi, was used to evaluate Hurricane Isaac in August 2012. This study provides a comprehensive cartographic methodology for evacuation zone mapping when the US coastline is threatened by a landfalling hurricane.					; Benjamin, Adam/GQY-6217-2022; Zick, Stephanie/B-1841-2013	Chen, Yin-Hsuen/0000-0003-4809-5718; Zick, Stephanie/0000-0002-8575-6100; Benjamin, Adam/0000-0002-3080-8188; 													1523-0406	1545-0465				JAN 1	2016	43	1			SI		68	85		10.1080/15230406.2015.1014426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2015.1014426													WOS:000364558500006

Parameters such as temperature, turbidity, oxidability were recorded over a four years interval. A comprehensive database on the evolution of these water parameters was thus created showing the tendency of these parameters across time. The possible correlations among the parameters were investigated. Positive correlations were found for oxidability and Al content and also for turbidity and oxidability. Temperature and turbidity were found to be highly variable (2-17 degrees C, 3-53 NTU) across seasons. In order to improve the turbidity of treated water, two coagulants were tested: basic polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and aluminum sulphate (SA) evaluating the efficiency of the two treatment methods. While the traditionally used aluminum sulphate was found to be effective only when the temperature and turbidity were high: temperature > 10 degrees C, turbidity > 10 NTU (nephelometric turbidity unit), PAC emerged as an efficient clarifying agent even at low temperature and turbidity.					; Dippong, Thomas/AAL-2913-2020; Dumuta, Anca/CAH-3328-2022; Mihali, Cristina/AFK-0922-2022	Dippong, Thomas/0000-0002-4625-6525; 													1224-7154						2016	61	2					225	238																WOS:000393576700018

The purpose of this sensor system is ultimately to determine how to use GNSS-R to monitor and distinguish liquid freshwater from lake ice, paving the way for routine remote sensing of seasonal ice formation. The sensor suite integrates disparate data sets, comparing the detection of GNSS-R at an elevated ground-based site to auxiliary data sets on collocated weather and surface conditions, using ground-based lidar and optical camera, in addition to satellite-based remote sensing imagery. Initial tests in the lab are conducted on the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) that are to serve as the GNSS front-ends for data collection campaigns. The test uses a simulated L1 GPS signal, with a GPS antenna connected to serve as a discipline for the USRP's oscillator. Initial testing of the lidar is also conducted in the lab. This experiment characterizes the lidar range and intensities from a variety of controlled surfaces mounted 1 m away from the lidar: an empty pan, still water 5 cm in depth, the same water disturbed, and ice. The USRP tests produce the power spectral density of the GPS L1 signal, but the time domain digitized data give a bi-modal rather than Gaussian histogram. Lidar range and intensity data are received from both the ice and water surfaces, with variations that correspond to the medium tested.

Unusual biogenic calcite structures in two shallow lakes, James Ross Island, Antarctica	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The floors of two shallow endorheic lakes, located on volcanic surfaces on James Ross Island, are covered with calcareous organosedimentary structures. Their biological and chemical composition, lake water characteristics, and seasonal variability of the thermal regime are introduced. The lakes are frozen down to the bottom for 89 months a year and their water chemistry is characterised by low conductivity and neutral to slightly alkaline pH. The photosynthetic microbial mat is composed of filamentous cyanobacteria and microalgae that are considered to be Antarctic endemic species. The mucilaginous black biofilm is covered by green spots formed by a green microalga and the macroscopic structures are packed together with fine material. Thin sections consist of rock substrate, soft biofilm, calcite spicules and mineral grains originating from different sources. The morphology of the spicules is typical of calcium carbonate monocrystals having a layered structure and specific surface texture, which reflect growth and degradation processes. The spicules' chemical composition and structure correspond to pure calcite. The lakes' age, altitude, morphometry, geomorphological and hydrological stability, including low sedimentation rates, together with thermal regime predispose the existence of this community. We hypothesise that the precipitation of calcite is connected with the photosynthetic activity of the green microalgae that were not recorded in any other lake in the region. This study has shown that the unique community producing biogenic calcite spicules is quite different to any yet described.

Diet of post-breeding Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) in Nahuel Huapi Lake, Patagonia Argentina	ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL												The Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) is a generalist species undergoing a process of range expansion and population increase in Patagonia. The ability of utilizing anthropogenic waste is one of the factors that might have enabled this expansion into freshwater environments. Colonization of new environments could affect directly or indirectly other species, throughout predation, competence or kleptoparasitism. In this sense, it is necessary to understand the diet of the recent populations settled in continental freshwater environments. The current study provides information about the post-breeding diet in a freshwater environment in Patagonia. We collected 75 regurgitated pellets in De La Guardia Islands during the post-breeding period between January and February 2010 in Nahuel Huapi Lake, Neuquen province, Argentina. Organic human refuse was the most frequent item (58.6%), followed by insects (33.3%) and crustaceans (17.3%). Insects (48.9%) and human refuse (24.7%) were the most important prey items in terms of abundance. Pellets were mainly cast by adults (mean number of adults = 77.1 per visit, SD = 40.6, range = 43-155), which were much more abundant than sub-adults (mean = 6.3 per visit, SD = 3.6, range = 3-15) or juveniles (mean = 3, SD = 2.8, range = 1-9). Human refuse importance in the diet of the Kelp Gull was as important during post-breeding as during breeding season. This is the first report of the post-breeding diet composition of the Kelp Gull in a continental freshwater environment.					; Frixione, Martín/ABK-3732-2022	Frixione, Martin Guillermo/0000-0001-9598-8901; Alarcon, Pablo A.

Under CID condition, water stress is frequently experienced in two contexts: first drought and then flooding (FDTF) and first flooding and then drought (FFTD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of FDTF and FFTD on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in paddy water at different growth stages. The effects of water stress on the migration and transformation of N and P were also investigated. Results showed that CID can decrease N and P concentrations in surface water. NH4+-N was the major form of N in surface drainage and percolation water. Mean total phosphorus (TP), NH4+-N, and NO3--N concentrations were significantly higher than in FFTD during the growth stage. Mean NH4+-N, NO3--N, and TP concentrations were significantly higher in percolation water under flooding stress than those under drought stress at growth stage, except for mean TP concentrations at milky stage (stage IV). Meanwhile, flooding can sharply increase the NH4+-N, NO3--N, and TP concentrations in percolation water after drought. Thus, without CID, the considerably high NH4+-N, NO3--N, and TP concentrations via runoff and leaching can be responsible for the eutrophication of water bodies in the vicinity of paddy fields during the rice growing season when water stress transforms from drought into flooding.																			2090-9063	2090-9071					2016	2016								2576015	10.1155/2016/2576015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/2576015													WOS:000379873800001

Recovery of Sockeye Salmon in the Elwha River, Washington, after Dam Removal: Dependence of Smolt Production on the Resumption of Anadromy by Landlocked Kokanee	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are adept at colonizing habitat that has been reopened to anadromous passage. Sockeye Salmon O. nerka are unique in that most populations require lakes to fulfill their life history. Thus, for Sockeye Salmon to colonize a system, projects like dam removals must provide access to lakes. However, if the lakes contain landlocked kokanee (lacustrine Sockeye Salmon), the recovery of Sockeye Salmon could be mediated by interactions between the two life history forms and the processes associated with the resumption of anadromy. Our objective was to evaluate the extent to which estimates of Sockeye Salmon smolt production and recovery are sensitive to the resumption of anadromy by kokanee after dam removal. We informed the analysis based on the abiotic and biotic features of Lake Sutherland, which was recently opened to passage after dam removal on the Elwha River, Washington. We first developed maximum expectations for the smolt-producing capacity of Lake Sutherland by using two predictive models developed from Sockeye Salmon populations in Alaska and British Columbia: one model was based on the mean seasonal biomass of macrozooplankton, and the other was based on the euphotic zone volume of the lake. We then constructed a bioenergetics-based simulation model to evaluate how the capacity of Lake Sutherland to rear yearling smolts could change with varying degrees of anadromy among O. nerka fry. We demonstrated that (1) the smolt-producing capacity of a nursery lake for juvenile Sockeye Salmon changes in nonlinear ways with changes in smolt growth, mortality, and the extent to which kokanee resume anadromy after dam removal; (2) kokanee populations may be robust to changes in abundance after dam removal, particularly if lakes are located higher in the watershed on tributaries separate from where dams were removed; and (3) the productivity of newly establishing Sockeye Salmon can vary considerably depending on whether the population becomes rearing limited or is recruitment limited and depending on how adult escapement is managed.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	6					1303	1317		10.1080/00028487.2016.1223752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2016.1223752													WOS:000387600000014

Modelling phosphorus dynamics in Cootes Paradise marsh: Uncertainty assessment and implications for eutrophication management	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Cootes Paradise marsh, a hypereutrophic wetland draining into the western end of Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, has historically been considered an important regulatory factor of the severity of local eutrophication phenomena. In this study, we present a modelling exercise that aims to draw inference on the relative contribution of various external and internal flux rates to the phosphorus budget of Cootes Paradise. We first examined the capacity of a phosphorus mass-balance model, accounting for the interplay among water column, sediments and macrophytes, to reproduce the observed total phosphorus dynamics over a 17-year period (1996-2012). Water level fluctuations were one of the key challenges for balancing the phosphorus budget during model calibration. Our analysis shows that the model satisfactorily reproduced the average seasonal patterns, as well as the year-to-year total phosphorus variability (coefficient of determination = 0.20, relative error = 26.8%, root mean square error = 62.2g P l(-1), model efficiency = 0.15). However, our model failed to capture two years of the study period (1997 and 2007), when ambient TP levels significantly deviated from the typically prevailing conditions. Model sensitivity analysis identified the sedimentation of particulate material and diffusive reflux from sediments as two critical processes to characterize the phosphorus cycle in the wetland. Based on the current parameter specification, our model postulates that the sediments still act as a net sink, whereas macrophyte processes (respiration rates, nutrient uptake from interstitial water) appear to play a minor role. We conclude by discussing the various sources of uncertainty and additional remedial actions required in Cootes Paradise marsh to realize a shift from the current turbid-phytoplankton dominated state to its former clear-macrophyte dominated state.

The relationship between abiotic factors and cell density of different Microcystis species was analyzed using the interval maxima regression (IMR) to determine the optimum temperature and nutrient concentrations for growth of different Microcystis species. Our results showed that cell density of all the Microcystis species increased along with the increase of water temperature, but Microcystis aeruginosa adapted to a wide range of temperatures. The optimum total dissolved nitrogen concentrations for M. aeruginosa, Microcystis wesenbergii, Microcystis ichthyoblabe, and unidentified Microcystis were 3.7, 2.0, 2.4, and 1.9 mg L-1, respectively. The optimum total dissolved phosphorus concentrations for different species were M. wesenbergii (0.27 mg L-1) > M. aeruginosa (0.1 mg L-1) > M. ichthyoblabe (0.06 mg L-1) approximate to unidentified Microcystis, and the iron (Fe3+) concentrations were M. wesenbergii (0.73 mg L-1) > M. aeruginosa (0.42 mg L-1) > M. ichthyoblabe (0.35 mg L-1) > unidentified Microcystis (0.09 mg L-1). The above results suggest that if phosphorus concentration was reduced to 0.06 mg L-1 or/and iron concentration was reduced to 0.35 mg L-1 in Lake Taihu, the large colonial M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa would be replaced by small colonial M. ichthyoblabe and unidentified Microcystis. Thereafter, the intensity and frequency of the occurrence of Microcystis blooms would be reduced by changing Microcystis species composition.

Assessment and modelling in freshwater fisheries	FRESHWATER FISHERIES ECOLOGY												This chapter surveys the principal assessment frameworks and associated modelling used in freshwater fisheries. Although modelling and assessment techniques are similar, the average freshwater fishery has about one tenth of the catches, value, food production and livelihoods of the average marine fishery. Significant exceptions are major fisheries in floodplains and great lakes that are important for regional food security, but their quantitative analysis brings serious challenges. Fishery data with which to assess status are often sparse, few freshwater fisheries have identified reference points as targets for management, and the quantification of uncertainties is generally poor: the emphasis is often, therefore, on approximate methods. Empirical and statistical models for lake fisheries include the morphoedaphic index and allied production models, including a model developed to predict fishery yields of introduced species. Examples include North American and African Great Lakes. Fisheries in floodplains, which can have exceptionally high production levels and which can receive significant terrestrial carbon inputs, are driven by a seasonal flood pulse but are more difficult to assess because of the lack of quantitative insight into these key ecological processes. Examples are discussed from Tonle Sap, Sumatra, the Pantanal and Amazon. Classic surplus production ('Schaefer') and dynamic pool ('catch-at-age') fishery assessment models are briefly described with examples from Lake Kariba and Lake Victoria. Spatialized and statistically fitted modern versions of these techniques are in use, mainly for better-documented North American Great Lakes. An interesting development that might soon be applied to freshwater fisheries is the use of indicators to approximate stock status assessments. Whole ecosystem simulation models are increasingly being developed in order to properly implement the widely adopted policy goal of ecosystem-based management: the Ecopath with Ecosim ('EwE') and 'Atlantis' modelling frameworks are briefly described. Examples are given from African (Malawi, Victoria and Kivu) and North American (Superior, Huron and Michigan) Great Lakes and the Pantanal floodplain. Since time, data and model limitations often make fully quantitative approaches impractical for many freshwater fisheries, some rapid appraisal techniques are described. To compare likely outcomes under alternative policy scenarios, fuzzy cognitive maps and the 'Rapfish' multidisciplinary rapid appraisal framework are relevant techniques. In the face of sparse data, more approximate management and policy models are likely to be devised as, even under primary management, there is an increasing need for decision support tools in freshwater ecosystems threatened by climate change, pollution, habitat sequestration and overfishing.																					978-1-118-39440-3; 978-1-118-39442-7				2016							483	499																WOS:000456962700040

JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Potamogeton crispus L. is a cosmopolitan aquatic species and is widely used as a pioneer species for ecological restoration. Many restoration projects that employ P. crispus turions are carried out in turbid water with the result that turions are covered by sediment deposition. Will these turions germinate in the next growing season? Previous studies have focused on the effects of light and temperature on turion sprouting. The purpose of this study is to determine whether sediment deposition influences turion sprouting and early growth of P. crispus. Turions were cultivated at a range of sediment depths (1-5 cm), whereas the control group (0 cm) was not covered by sediment, only inserted into sediment. Turion sprouting, plant height, leaf number, leaf area and plant dry weight were monitored. The results showed that the sprouting time of the turions was delayed with increasing sediment thickness. The maximum sprouting rate and leaf number occurred at 2.0 cm depth; however, the plant height, leaf area and plant dry weight all decreased with increasing deposition thickness. Turion sprouting was delayed by sediment coverage and was affected by anoxic conditions and low temperature without light. It is feasible to employ P. crispus turions in restoration projects in turbid water. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of turion sprouting dynamics of P. crispus and will be useful for restoration programs.

Total of 45 Oligochaeta species were collected from 75 different habitats. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) explained 81% of the correlation among species and environmental variables with about % 32.5 of variance. Influential variables on the species distribution from most to least affective follow as water depth, Secchi depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, elevation, temperature, CaCO3=, electrical conductivity and salinity. Species were clustered into six groups with Unweighted Pair Group Mean Averages (UPGMA) analyses based on species occurrence. Overall, results suggest that each Oligochaeta species has species-specific habitat preferences although some of them overlap in their requirements.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	10					4362	4373																WOS:000386746100064

The heavy metals were accumulated at varying levels in different tissues of tench. The concentration of heavy metals in different tissues of fishes varied for Cu: 0.067-3.793, Fe: 0.460-13.22, Mn: 0.041-1.366, Zn: 0.135-3.783, Cr: nd-1.177 and Al: 0.232-2.07 mu g g(-1) dry weight. Heavy metal levels in tissues were compared with national and international permissible limits. The values of all metals in muscles of the analyzed fish were found to be below the established limit values. Seasonal changes in metal (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr and Al) concentration were observed in the tissues of tench, but these variations may not influence consumption advisories. Consequently, this study suggests that various metals were present in the fish muscle tissues at different levels, but these were within the maximum residual levels permitted by Turkish standards and the WHO/FAO; thus, the fish from these areas are generally safe for human consumption					Ciftci, Harun/ADX-8861-2022; Er Caliskan, Cigdem/HSG-1883-2023; AKKAN, TAMER/O-8851-2018														1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	6					1972	1977																WOS:000379797800026

J	Higgins, SN; Hecky, RE; Guildford, SJ				Higgins, SN; Hecky, RE; Guildford, SJ			Modeling the growth, biomass, and of Cladophora glomerata tissue phosphorus concentration in eastern Lake Erie: Model description and field testing	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cladophora glomerata is a filamentous alga that currently forms extensive blooms in nearshore areas of Lake Ontario, eastern Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, and isolated locations in Lake Huron. During the late 1970s an extensive effort was put forward to model Cladophora growth and biomass accrual based on several highly dynamic ecological variables including: Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), water temperature, and carrying capacity (Canale and Auer 1982a). The original "Canale and Auer" model was developed and validated in proximity to a sewage treatment outfall in Lake Huron and predicted Cladophora growth and biomass over a range of SRP concentrations, at shallow depths (0-3 m), with reasonable accuracy. We present a revised version of the "Canale and Auer" model, which we refer to as the Cladophora Growth Model (CGM). The CGM expands its utility, of the Canale and Auer model to greater depths and to areas of non-point source P loading while reducing the quantity of input data required. The CGM was incorporated into a computer simulation model using Stella modeling software, and is available from the corresponding author of this manuscript. The CGM was tested over a single growing season at five sites, and three depths (2, 5, 10 m), that represented a wide geographical distribution and expected range in ecological conditions in eastern Lake Erie. The CGM predicted growth, biomass, and tissue phosphorus concentrations with reasonable accuracy. The revised model is useful for: 1) Predicting Cladophora growth, biomass, and tissue phosphorus concentrations under non-point source P loading with no depth restrictions; 2) providing estimates of the timing and magnitude of the midsummer sloughing phenomenon; 3) determining the contribution of Dreissena invasion to the resurgence of Cladophora in eastern Lake Erie; and 4) developing Management strategies for Cladophora abatement.

The state space is first reconstructed by embedding the univariate time series of the response variable in a space of dimension (D) with a delay time (tau). To obtain a forecast from a given time point t, three steps are involved: (i) the current state of the system is mapped on to the state space, known as the feature vector, (ii) a small number (K = alpha * n, alpha=fraction (0, 1] of the data, n=data length) of neighbors (and their future evolution) to the feature vector are identified in the state space, and (iii) a polynomial of order p is fitted to the identified neighbors, which is then used for prediction. A suite of parameter combinations (D, tau, alpha, p) is selected based on an objective criterion, called the Generalized Cross Validation (GCV). All of the selected parameter combinations are then used to issue a T-step iterated forecast starting from the current time t, thus generating an ensemble forecast which can be used to obtain the forecast probability density function (PDF). The ensemble approach improves upon the traditional method of providing a single mean forecast by providing the forecast uncertainty. Further, for short noisy data it can provide better forecasts. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on two synthetic (Henon and Lorenz attractors) and two real data sets (Great Salt Lake bi-weekly volume and NINO3 index). This framework can also be used to forecast a vector of response variables based on a vector of predictors.

Blanket bog has been listed for protection under Annex 1. of the EU habitats directive, making the conservation of intact bogs as well as the restoration of degraded sites a priority. In order to assess how effective a restoration measure this has been it is important to look at the biodiversity within the site. This study compared the macroinvertebrate and microcrustacean communities ill open-water habitats of an intact and a. restored mountain blanket bog in County Wicklow over a number of seasons. It also examined the hydrochemistry of both treatments. Hydrochemically there was no difference between the restored and intact pools. Neither was there any significant difference between the two in terms of taxon richness, abundance, community composition or structure. Season was found to significantly affect the structure of the invertebrate communities in both areas. It is not known how long it takes a peatland to return to its natural state. However, we can conclude that the restoration measures implemented fifteen years ago have provided an aquatic habitat similar to that of the intact site.

Snake prices and crocodile appetites: Aquatic wildlife supply and demand on Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Commercial trade is a major driver of over-exploitation of wild species, but the pattern of demand and how it responds to changes in supply is poorly understood. Here we explore the markets for snakes from Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia to evaluate future exploitation scenarios, identify entry points for conservation and, more generally, to illustrate the value of multi-scale analysis of markets to traded wildlife conservation. In Cambodia, the largest driver of snake exploitation is the domestic trade in snakes as crocodile food. We estimate that farmed crocodiles consume between 2.7 and 12.2 million snakes per year. The market price for crocodiles has been in decline since 2003, which, combined with rising prices for their food, has led to a reduced frequency of feeding and closure of small farms. The large farms that generate a disproportionate amount of the demand for snakes continue to operate in anticipation of future market opportunities, and preferences for snakes could help maintain demand if market prices for crocodiles rise to pre 2003 levels. In the absence of a sustained demand from crocodile farms, it is also possible that alternative markets will develop, such as one for human snack food. The demand for snakes, however, also depends on the availability of substitute resources, principally fish. The substitutability and low price elasticity of demand offers a relatively sustainable form of consumerism. Given the nature of these market drivers, addressing consumer preferences and limiting the protection of snakes to their breeding season are likely to be the most effective tools for conservation. This study highlights the importance of understanding the structure of markets and the behaviour of consumer demand prior to implementing regulations on wildlife hunting and trade.

We measured N2O emissions at 10-day intervals during the growing season (early July to late September) in 2008. N2O emissions were measured with static chambers in four typical vegetation stands. The results showed great spatial variations of N2O emissions among the four stands. The greatest N2O emissions (0.052 +/- 0.063 mg N2O m(-2)h(-1)) were from Scirpus triqueter stand, while the lowest N2O emissions (0.020 +/- 0.020 mg N2O m(-2) h (1)) were from Typha angustifolia stand. To such spatial variations in N2O emissions, standing water depths and soil water content may be important explaining factors. Besides spatial variations, we also found significant temporal variations of N2O emissions in this area. The temporal variation of N2O emissions in the growing season was not found significantly related to any measured factor in the study. However, based on principal component analysis, we consider it partly caused by thermal conditions and the marked temporal variation of the standing water depth in the growing season, which to some degree influenced the process of denitrification and N2O emissions. These results about TGR enable us to make a more reasonable estimate of N2O emissions from large dam reservoirs, particularly those with a large drawdown area in the growing season in an agricultural landscape.

Reproductive strategies of Red-bellied Piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri Kner, 1858) in the white waters of the Mamiraua flooded forest, central Brazilian Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Despite being an important member of neotropical fish assemblages, as well as a species with an unenviable reputation, little is known about the reproductive ecology of Red-bellied Piranha, Pygocentrus nattereri, in the wild. We tracked the reproductive activity of piranhas in the flooded forests of Mamiraua Reserve, Central Brazilian Amazon, for 2 years, in an investigation that included over 3,000 individual fish. Contrary to expectation piranhas had not one, but rather two annual reproductive seasons, tuned to water level fluctuation and the flooding pulse. Females were found to have up to 30,000 oocytes, little more than one third of which were mature and available for spawning in a single batch. Sexual maturation (of both males and females) occurred at around 160 mm. At this point sexually active individuals (of both sexes) became dark and lost most of their red coloration. Ontogenetic changes in habitat selection were strongly associated with the spawning behavior of mature adults. We also found that flooded marginal vegetation and marginal grasses inside lakes were the preferred spawning areas. In contrast, non-reproductive individuals were found in open water and under floating meadows.

J	Leblanc, JP; Farrell, JM				Leblanc, John Paul; Farrell, John M.			Influence of water-level variability on fish assemblage and natural reproduction following connectivity enhancement in a Typha-dominated coastal wetland, USA	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												We evaluated a wetland habitat modification strategy to contrast fish assemblage structure and the production of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish between different engineered habitats (i.e., spawning pool complexes and connectivity channels) relative to unmodified lateral channels in a large drowned river mouth tributary of the St Lawrence River. Prior to habitat modifications, the coastal wetland was impaired by water level regulations and dominance of the invasive hybrid cattail, Typha x glauca, which collectively replaced or created barriers to seasonally flooded spawning habitats important to fish. Connectivity enhancements provided fish access along a wetland habitat gradient from sedge-meadows to the deeper water robust emergent main channel. Across an 8-year fish emigration dataset (2012, 2013, 2016-2021) more than 90% of all captured fish (N-total = 218,086 fish) were YOY and modified habitats outperformed the unmodified channels in total fish catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) per year (both YOY and non-YOY). Spawning pool complexes had higher YOY species richness than unmodified channel habitats. Fish assemblage structure differed between the modified habitats, where connectivity channels and unmodified channels shared a more similar fish assemblage than spawning pool complexes. Modified habitats, however, supported warmer water and higher dissolved oxygen than the unmodified channels. Redundancy analysis and linear mixed-effect modelling with abiotic variables (hydrology, temperature and dissolved oxygen) showed significant effects on fish assemblage structure, species richness and CPUE of fish emigrating from the modified and unmodified habitats. Historic flooding in 2017 and 2019 was a primary driver of YOY fish production and fish assemblage structure, but also appeared to be associated with near anoxic conditions systemwide. YOY fish for several species was inversely affected by floods at spawning pool complexes, but CPUE of YOY fish for these species appeared unaffected at the connectivity channels despite low dissolved oxygen. Diversified habitat structure (i.e., connectivity channels and spawning pool complexes) offers a management option to enhance habitat for fish that allowed compensatory effects on the capture of YOY fish of several species during floods. This multifaceted outcome from the habitat modifications resulted in unique fish assemblages between the channelized and spawning pool habitat. A connectivity-based habitat enhancement strategy provides adaptability for an uncertain climatic and regulatory future for the Laurentian Great Lakes and St Lawrence River.

J	Brooks, S; Reynolds, J; Allison, E				Brooks, Sharon E.; Reynolds, John D.; Allison, Edward H.			Sustained by Snakes? Seasonal Livelihood Strategies and Resource Conservation by Tonle Sap Fishers in Cambodia	HUMAN ECOLOGY												This paper situates concerns for conservation of aquatic snakes and livelihood sustainability in Cambodia within a social-ecological systems context and thereby presents a challenge to conventional species-based conservation programmes. Fishing for low-value water snakes has become a widespread activity within the floating communities of Tonle Sap Lake in the last 20 years in response to new market opportunities, provided primarily by a crocodile farming industry. The scale and intensity of this new form of exploitation and reports of declines in catch per fisher have highlighted this activity as a conservation concern, yet its role within local livelihood strategies was previously unknown. We show that it is of increasing importance to the less well-off, and is linked to higher incomes within this group, where it potentially reduces their vulnerability to fluctuations and declines in fish catches. It is particularly important as a means to smooth seasonality of incomes in this flood pulse-driven social-ecological system. We argue that shifts between snake-hunting and fishing, as a market-driven adaptive livelihood strategy by the poor, may be more compatible with wider ecosystem conservation and development goals than alternatives such as increased fishing effort or converting floodplain habitats for seasonal agriculture.

The northeast eco-region lakes often present a marked seasonal variability in hydrological, biological and geochemical processes, which could affect physico-chemical variables, chlorophyll-a and Secchi depth reference conditions. Reference conditions were calculated using two different methods: lake population distribution method and trisection method. General physico-chemical reference conditions (pH, conductivity, BOD and nutrients) and chlorophyll-a, and Secchi depth reference conditions were established using the two approaches combined with the analysis of seasonal variability for each parameter for shallow and deep lake types in the northeast eco-region lakes. The results indicated that depth was an important factor affecting physico-chemical variables, chlorophyll-a and Secchi depth reference values. Moreover, the seasonal differences in parameters were also assessed using a non-parametric repeated measure ANOVA (Friedman test) in the shallow and deep lakes. Some parameters showed a seasonal variability for shallow and deep lakes. The least restrictive reference values of the four seasons were proposed to simplify the water quality assessment for regional lake management goals. These results indicated that the 50th percentile (median) value from the best one-third of the nutrient-concentration data distributions is more appropriate for the northeast eco-region lakes.					su, jing/HPF-8459-2023; Xi, Beidou/KEE-8922-2024; Huo, Shouliang/D-1364-2013														1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2014	71	3					995	1005		10.1007/s12665-013-2656-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2656-9													WOS:000330124100001

Seasonal variation of the protozooplanktonic community in a tropical oligotrophic environment (Ilha Solteira reservoir, Brazil)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The seasonal variation of the protozooplanktonic community (ciliates and testate amoebae) was studied in a tropical oligotrophic reservoir in Brazil, which was under the influence of two contrasting climatic seasons (rainy/warm and dry/cold). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of these climatic changes on physical, chemical and biological variables in the dynamic of this community. The highest mean density of total protozoans occurred in the rainy/warm season (5683.2 ind L-1), while the lowest was in the dry/cold (2016.0 ind L-1). Considering the seasonal variations, the protozoan groups that are truly planktonic, such as the oligotrichs (Spirotrichea), predominated in the dry season, whereas during the rainy season, due to the material input and resuspension of sediment, sessile protozoans of the Peritrichia group were the most important ones. The dominant protozoans were Urotricha globosa, Cothurnia annulata, Pseudodifflugia sp. and Halteria grandinella. The highest densities of H. grandinella were associated with more oxygenated and transparent water conditions, while the highest densities of C. annulata occurred in sites with high turbidity, pH and trophic state index (TSI). The study demonstrated that density and composition of protozooplanktonic species and groups of the reservoir suffered seasonal variation due to the environmental variables (mainly temperature, turbidity, water transparency, dissolved oxygen and TSI) and the biological variables (e.g. morphological characteristics, eating habits and escape strategies from predation of the species).					; Seleghim, Mirna/C-6909-2012; Leite, Mauricio/KHE-4105-2024; Mansano, Adrislaine/D-1188-2017	Regali Seleghim, Mirna Helena/0000-0001-6355-8114; Leite, Mauricio Augusto/0000-0002-2899-9456; 													1519-6984	1678-4375				MAY	2013	73	2					321	330		10.1590/S1519-69842013000200012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842013000200012								23917559					WOS:000322536400011

The two year survey of zooplankton revealed 33 species (23 rotifers, five cladocerans, four copepods and one mollusc larva). The mean integrated abundance of the total zooplankton ranged between 83.6 and 442.7 ind. L-1, with the higher density to be recorded in the surface 0-20 m layer. Small numbers of specimens of almost all species were found also in the hypoxic or anoxic hypolimnion. Copepods and especially the calanoid Eudiaptomus drieschi dominated the zooplankton community throughout the sampling period, followed by Dreissena polymorpha larvae, rotifers and cladocerans. Seasonal succession among the cladocerans and the most abundant rotifer species was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll-a was the most important factor for the variation of total zooplankton, as well as for the rotifers' community. Dissolved oxygen affected copepods and cladocerans, water level correlated mainly with the molluscs larvae of D. polymorpha, while temperature influenced the variation of several rotifers, the cladoceran Diaphanosoma orghidani and the mollusc larvae. Negative correlation of conductivity with the cladoceran Daphnia cucullata and the copepods E. drieschi and Macrocyclops albidus was found. The differences in species composition found in Lake Amvrakia in comparison to the nearby lakes are probably ought to the geographical isolation and perhaps to its particular chemistry (e.g., elevated conductivity).

Zoological Studies 45(3): 428-434. Bitterling (Cyprinidae: Acheilognathinae) are freshwater fishes with a unique spawning relationship with freshwater mussels on whose gills they lay their eggs. During the breeding season of bitterling fishes, we collected 843 mussels belonging to 16 species from Lake Qinglan, central China and examined their gill chambers for the presence of bitterling larvae. Three species of bitterling larvae were identified; Acheilognathus tonkinensis, Ach. cf. meridianus, and Ach. barbatulus, in 3 species of mussel: Unio douglasiae, Lamprotula caveata, and L. tortuosa, suggesting host specialization. Using our own and other published data, we compared the respective phylogenies of bitterling and mussels, but failed to show clear congruence. However, broad specializations are evident, with Acheilognathus and Tanakia showing preferences for mussels with a relatively simple gill structure (Ableminae), and Rhodeus spp. showing preferences for mussels of the Anodontinae and Unioninae, which have more-complex gill structures.					; Smith, Carl/A-2254-2015; Reichard, Martin/C-6563-2009	Reichard, Martin/0000-0002-9306-0074; 													1021-5506					JUL	2006	45	3					428	434																WOS:000240532400013

JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Changes in the gonado-somatic index and abundance of the different Labeobarbus species in the mouths of four major afferent rivers of Lake Tana, Ethiopia, were monitored monthly during 1999 and 2000. Riverine spawning was characteristic for seven of Lake Tana's 15 contemporary Labeobarbus species. These seven did not show spatial segregation among afferent rivers but significant temporal segregation occurred in aggregating in the river mouths and migrating towards the upstream spawning areas during the breeding season (June-October). Among the eight other species, peak gonad development occurred generally in the same period as in the riverine spawners. These species, however, did not aggregate in the river mouths during the breeding period and were absent from the upstream spawning areas. A derived, novel strategy, lacustrine spawning was hypothesized for these eight Labeobarbus species. This hypothesis was further supported by observations of running female fishes in the littoral zones distant from any of the afferent rivers. This derived strategy is only common among the littoral-dwelling Labeobarbus species with restricted distribution patterns. At present it is thought that sequential waves of speciation and habitat divergence followed by trophic specialization, shaped the diversity of Lake Tana labeobarbs.

However, it is not known whether the seasonal dynamics are due to shifts in the activity of bacteria already present, or shifts in community structure towards emergence or disappearance of chitinolytic organisms. We traced seasonal shifts in the chitinase gene assemblage in a temperate lake and linked these communities to variation in chitinase activity. Chitinase genes from 20 samples collected over a full yearly cycle were characterized by pyrosequencing. Pronounced temporal shifts in composition of the chitinase gene pool (beta diversity) occurred along with distinct shifts in richness (alpha diversity) as well as chitin processing. Changes in the chitinase gene pool correlated mainly with temperature, abundance of crustacean zooplankton and phytoplankton blooms. Also changes in the physical structure of the lake, e.g. stratification and mixing were associated with changes in the chitinolytic community, while differences were minor between surface and suboxic hypolimnetic water. The lake characteristics influencing the chitinolytic community are all linked to changes in organic particles and we suggest that seasonal changes in particle quality and availability foster microbial communities adapted to efficiently degrade them.

Surface glacier material was collected and analyzed via X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) for geochemical composition and mineralogy. In situ data was used as ground truth for comparison with satellite derived geochemical results. Supraglacial debris spectral response patterns and emissivity-derived silica weight percent are presented. Qualitative spectral response patterns agreed well with XRF elemental abundances. Quantitative emissivity estimates of supraglacial SiO2 in continental areas were 67% (Switzerland) and 68% (Nepal), while volcanic supraglacial SiO2 averages were 58% (Iceland) and 56% (New Zealand), yielding general agreement. Ablation season supraglacial temperature variation due to differing dust and debris type and coverage was also investigated, with surface debris temperatures ranging from 5.9 to 26.6 degrees C in the study regions. Applications of the supraglacial geochemical reflective and emissive characterization methods include glacier areal extent mapping, debris source identification, glacier kinematics and glacier energy balance considerations.

Occurrence of priority organic pollutants in Strymon river catchment, Greece: inland, transitional, and coastal waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Twenty-five sampling stations were selected in order to monitor persistent organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine (OC) pesticides and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) in surface water from Kerkini Lake, the Strymon River, its main tributaries and estuary in N. Aegean Sea during January to July, 2008, according to recent European Union (EU) guidelines. The data were divided among the high (January to April) and the low flow season (May to July). Generally, the values for organic pollutants were within the range reported worldwide for surface water. Elevated PAHs concentrations were observed compared with other places in Greece. Anthracene and benzo(a)pyrene exceeded maximum allowable concentration (MAC) of the relative EU guideline. Also, concentrations above MAC were observed for OCs, gamma-HCH, and a-endosulfan. Despite the fact that it is banned since 1972, Aldrin was detected during the monitoring season (from limit of detection (LOD) to 15 ng L-1). Total PCB concentrations ranged from LOD to 162 ng L-1. In addition, the load of organic pollutants was estimated in April (high flow) and June (low flow) in selected sampling stations. According to this estimation, napthalene, anthracene, and fluoranthene (PAHs), total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), aldrin, and total PCBs had the highest load. Taking into account the relative EU guidelines concerning the pollutants studied, the water quality in the Strymon River catchment could be characterized as poor, which can lead to negative impacts to its biota.

Ecological implications from geochemical records of Miocene Western Amazonian bivalves	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Stable-isotope profiles through successive growth increments of Miocene bivalves from Western Amazonia reveal paleobiological characteristics, such as biotope preferences, longevity, and ontogenetic development. Two groups of bivalves, a fluvial and a lacustrine group, are recognized. The fluvial group is composed of pearly freshwater mussels whose isotope profiles are characterized by clearly recognizable cyclicity of considerable amplitude, similar to those from pearly freshwater mussels studied from the modern Amazon region. The lacustrine group, dominated by pachydontine bivalves, is characterized by very low amplitude and irregular isotope signals. Additional trace element analyses show seasonal variation in phase with stable isotope cycles. Seasonal stable isotope cycles show growth rates and longevity in bivalves from the fluvial group but are not clearly expressed in the lacustrine group. The Miocene Pebas ecosystem of Western Amazonia can be characterized as a wetland system of connected shallow lakes, swamps, and tributaries. The stable isotope signatures of fluvial bivalves are good recorders of prior seasonal climate changes, in contrast with those of lacustrine bivalves. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interaction among bacterioplankton and macrophytes in shallow lakes with high macrophyte cover	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Growth of submerged and emergent macrophytes was studied together with heterotrophic bacterioplankton abundance and production in two Hungarian shallow lakes with dominant macrophyte covers. It was expected that bacterioplankton numbers and activity would have an effect on macrophyte biomass accumulation. Bacterial production and abundance showed a strong seasonal pattern with maximum in the warmest months (July, August). It was found that macrophyte biomass increased with heterotrophic bacterial production and abundance up to 5.6 mu g C l(- 1) h(- 1)and 5.30*10(6)cells, respectively, while over that value was negatively associated with macrophyte growth. It was also shown that the relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and macrophytes also varied seasonally, showing a multifaceted relationship. It was demonstrated that macrophytes are not only the most significant carbon and energy source for the bacteria in shallow, macrophyte-dominated lakes, but are also competing organisms that could be supressed by excessive bacterial activity. These findings could help better understand the interaction between macrophytes and bacterioplankton, and assist wetland managers in quantifying what may be a primary cause of reed die-back.					; Tóth, Viktor/MFZ-7583-2025	Toth, Viktor/0000-0002-6182-2759; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				SEP 5	2020	82	4							79	10.1007/s00027-020-00753-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-00753-9													WOS:000566089100001

Although forest streams are widely distributed across various forest regions, seasonal dynamics of OC in forest sediments have not been fully investigated. MethodsHere, we sampled soils (0-5 cm) in 15 representative forest stream sediments for 5 critical periods (snowmelt season, early growing season, growing season, late growing season, and seasonal snow cover season) during a one-year investigation in a geologically fragile subalpine coniferous forest catchment in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan province and the OC concentrations were measured by potassium dichromate external heating method. ResultsThe OC concentration of stream sediments ranged from 6.39 to 458.93 g kg(-1), and the average was 84.56 g kg(-1) for 15 streams in 5 critical periods during a 1-year investigation. Correspondingly, their stocks ranged from 2.05 to 310.56 kg m(-2), and the average was 46.03 kg m(-2). The maximum and minimum OC stocks were consistently observed during the late growing season and the snowmelt season, respectively. Otherwise, the OC stocks ranged from 1.31 to 218.05, 1.29 to 182.64, and 0.99 to 190.38 kg m(-2) for the upstream, midstream, and downstream sediments, and the average was 39.36, 36.58, and 37.93 kg m(-2), respectively. The average ratios of the OC stocks of the upstream and downstream ranged from 0.10-6.31, with an average of 1.43, during 5 critical periods, which indicated that the forest stream sediments may play crucial roles as carbon sources. DiscussionFurthermore, based on regression analysis, we found that the seasonal dynamics of OC concentrations and stocks were mainly regulated by precipitation, temperature, sediment depth, and litter carbon input to the streams together. These findings demonstrate that forest stream sediments may play crucial roles in the carbon biogeochemical cycle of subalpine forests and adjoining streams.

In the present study, we evaluated the genotoxicity of surface water after treatment with different disinfectants by means of in situ plant genotoxicity assays (micronucleus and chromosomal aberration tests) which can detect both clastogenic and aneugenic effects. The study was carried out at a pilot plant using lake water after sedimentation and filtration. This water supplied four stainless steel basins: three basins were disinfected with sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, and peracetic acid and the fourth basin containing untreated lake water was used as a control. Plants were exposed in situ in the basins. The study was carried out using water collected in different seasons over a period of about I year in order to assess the treatments in different physical and chemical lake water conditions. The micronucleus test in root cells of Vicia faba (Vicia faba/MCN test) revealed genotoxicity in many samples of disinfected water. The micronucleus test in Tradescantia pollen cells and the chromosome aberration test in root cells of Allium cepa showed genotoxic effects only in some disinfected samples, but also revealed genotoxicity in raw water. The results of the study indicated that the Vicia faba/MCN test was the most sensitive plant assay for disinfected water and that peracetic acid disinfection produced similar or lower genotoxicity than sodium hypochlorite or chlorine dioxide treatment.

Here, we examined soil CH(4)emissions and the community composition of CH4-cycling microorganisms under three vegetation types-mudflat (MF, no vegetation cover),Carexmeadow (CM, mainlyCarex brevicuspis), and reed land (RL, mainlyMiscanthus sacchariflorus)-from water-adjacent areas to higher-elevation land in the Dongting Lake floodplain, China. The results showed that CH(4)emission is the highest in CM, while significant absorption was observed in the RL site. The abundance ratio of methanogen/methanotroph was the highest in CM, intermediate in MF, and lowest in RL. TheMethanosarcinaceaefamily represented the dominant methanogens in the three sampling sites (41.32-75.25%). The genusMethylocystis(60.85%, type II methanotrophs) was dominant in CM, whileMethylobacterandMethylosarcina(type I methanotrophs) were the dominant genera in MF (51.00%) and RL (50.24%), respectively. Structural equation model analysis showed that methanogen and methanotroph abundance were affected by water table depth, soil water content, and pH indirectly through soil organic content, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen. These results indicated that the Dongting Lake floodplain may change from a CH(4)source to a CH(4)sink with vegetation succession with an increase in elevation, and the methanogen/methanotroph ratio can be used as a proxy for CH(4)emission in wetland soils. The continuous increase in reed area combined with the decrease inCarexmeadow may mitigate CH(4)emission and enhance the CH(4)sink function during the non-flood season in the Dongting Lake floodplain.					任, 奕洁/IQW-9044-2023; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022; Zhang, Chengyi/B-7687-2012	, Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X; 														2073-4433				SEP	2020	11	9							997	10.3390/atmos11090997	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11090997													WOS:000580146400001

In the present study a nonparametric Mann-Kendall test with an additional process to remove the effect of temporal (serial) correlation was used to detect the temporal trend of OCPs in the atmosphere over the Great Lakes region and to examine the statistical significance of the trends. Using extended time series of measured air concentrations over the Great Lakes region from the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network, this study also revisits relationships between seasonal mean air concentration of OCPs and major climate variabilities in the Northern Hemisphere. To effectively extract climate signals from the temporal trend of air concentrations, we detrended air concentrations through removing their linear trend, which is driven largely by their respective half-lives in the atmosphere. The interannual variations of the extended time series show a good association with interannual climate variability, notably, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. This study demonstrates that the stronger climate signals can be extracted from the detrended time series of air concentrations of some legacy OCPs. The detrended concentration time series also help to interpret, in addition to the connection with interannual variation of the NAO, the links between atmospheric concentrations of OCPs and decadal or interdecadal climate change.					; jiang, min/D-2531-2009	Dove, Alice/0000-0003-0152-0844; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG 14	2010	115								D15307	10.1029/2009JD013627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JD013627													WOS:000280956300006

Seasonal variation in black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) taxocenoses from the Brazilian Savannah (Tocantins, Brazil)	JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY												We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of blackfly larvae on a mesohabitat scale atfour different breeding sites in the Brazilian savannah Cerrado. A total of 2,385 larvae of 12 different species were collected, and three of the sampling sites revealedspecies richness and diversity peaks in April. A principal components analysis was performed to reduce abiotic data into a smaller set of independent variables, such as precipitation and river size, and subsequent linear regressions showed that Simulium subpallidum was positively correlated with precipitation. This species, along with S. nigrimanum, was negatively correlated withriver size, whereasS. perflavum was negatively correlated with precipitation. Beta diversity was negatively correlated withprecipitation, and black fly taxocenoses were markedly different between wet and dry seasons, as shown through nonmetric multidimensional scaling, suggesting that precipitation playsa major role in structuring these communities, probably because of enhanced drift and the dendritic nature of lotic metacommunities.

Climate warming affects the ecophysiology of fish, and fish close to the cold end of their thermal distribution are expected to increase somatic growth from increased temperatures and a prolonged growth season, which in turn affects maturation schedules, reproduction, and survival, boosting population growth. Accordingly, fish species living in ecosystems close to their northern range edge should increase in relative abundance and importance, and possibly displace cold-water adapted species. We aim to document whether and how population-level effects of warming are mediated by individual-level responses to increased temperatures, shift community structure, and composition in high latitude ecosystems. We studied 11 cool-water adapted perch populations in communities dominated by cold-water adapted species (whitefish, burbot, and charr) to investigate changes in the relative importance of the cool-water perch during the last 30 years of rapid warming in high latitude lakes. In addition, we studied the individual-level responses to warming to clarify the potential mechanisms underlying the population effects. Our long-term series (1991-2020) reveal a marked increase in numerical importance of the cool-water fish species, perch, in ten out of eleven populations, and in most fish communities perch is now dominant. Moreover, we show that climate warming affects population-level processes via direct and indirect temperature effects on individuals. Specifically, the increase in abundance arises from increased recruitment, faster juvenile growth, and ensuing earlier maturation, all boosted by climate warming. The speed and magnitude of the response to warming in these high latitude fish communities strongly suggest that cold-water fish will be displaced by fish adapted to warmer water. Consequently, management should focus on climate adaptation limiting future introductions and invasions of cool-water fish and mitigating harvesting pressure on cold-water fish.

This study analyzed the results of the explorations and geophysical studies conducted by the Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science. In addition, we simulated and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of groundwater in the area based on hydro-meteorological data, snow data, and remote sensing data. During the process, the dynamic changes in the attributes of aquifers due to the seasonal freeze-thaw processes of soils, including the active layer, were also taken into account. The results showed the following: (1) According to the analysis of the measured data on water levels in hydrogeological observation well 14E/2014, the difference between the simulated and measured values of groundwater levels in monitoring wells for over 99% of the measurements was less than 0.1 m. The average difference between the measured (excluding missing values) and simulated values of groundwater level in the monitoring wells was 0.028 m/d. (2) The annual average water level in the study area declined. The simulated value dropped at a rate of 0.10 m/a, with only a gap of 0.01 m/a with the measured value. Meanwhile, the simulated water head was greatly influenced by the terrain, especially in the central area, where the head decreased rapidly from the perimeter toward the lakes (8.9 m/km on average). (3) From 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2015, the mean value of the simulated discharge in the study area was 3888.39 L/d, which was in line with the results of previous monitoring (the average flow was 4147.20 L/d and 3715.20 L/d in 2014 and 2015, respectively). This study can provide a reference for the reasonable exploitation and utilization of groundwater under the influence of the distribution of perennially unfrozen zones, or taliks, and provides an effective three-dimensional modeling method for quantifying the analysis of groundwater dynamics in permafrost regions.

Terrestrial mesofauna in above- and below-ground habitats: Taylor Valley, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												In the McMurdo Dry Valleys region of Antarctica, above-ground production is often limited to mosses and algae that occur near seasonally available liquid water such as ephemeral streams and ice-covered lakes. Compared to surrounding dry soils these critical transition zones are highly productive and harbor a more diverse assemblage of soil animals, including rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes and microarthropods. Current cooling trends punctuated by warming events, and predicted future climate warming are expected to affect the hydrology of this region and thereby biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Above-ground communities are exposed to more variable temperature, relative humidity and greater UV radiation, and may be more vulnerable to climate change than sediments beneath, which are buffered from short-term changes. In this study, we compared above- and below-ground communities associated with either moss or cyanobacterial mats along glacial-fed streams and lakes differing in biological complexity (diversity, productivity and habitat suitability). All groups of soil fauna were more abundant in the above-ground material compared to the sediment beneath. Common indicators of habitat suitability (chlorophyll a, soil pH, soil salinity, and soil nitrogen) did not differ between vegetation types but were significantly different among sites. Variables most correlated with invertebrate abundances were sediment salinity, chlorophyll a content and nitrogen concentration. The McMurdo Dry Valleys are expected to become warmer and wetter as a result of climate change. This will likely increase the area of suitable habitat for most soil animals as areas of liquid water potentially increase and become available for longer periods of time.

The largest pulse occurred from 7 to 8 July, when 32% of the monitored seasonal sediment transport ccurred in only four hours. SSC reached 83,760 mg L-1 exceeding all previously recorded values from high arctic glacially-fed and snowmelt-fed rivers by more than one order of magnitude. The event occurred after the majority of snow in the watershed had melted, and was preceded by a long period of relatively high air temperature, and a small rainfall event on 7 July.

This influence consists of not only the carcasses of spent adults, but also the nutrients that they excrete subsidising stream communities. Given the complex food-web structure of stream communities, which includes aquatic insects from various functional feeding groups, resource subsidies provided by migratory fishes should influence stream communities through multiple pathways. We evaluated the ecological influence of an iteroparous three-lips fish (Opsariichthys uncirostris uncirostris) in a alluvial stream by treating fish weirs as large-scale manipulative field experiments. Between fish-bearing and fish-free areas, we compared concentrations of nutrients and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), and compared densities and stable isotopes of periphyton and benthic macroinvertebrates. The presence of the three-lips increased the concentrations of ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a densities by up to 2.7-fold. The delta N-15 of FPOM and macroinvertebrates during the migratory season were 2.8-7.0 parts per thousand higher in the fish-bearing area, indicating a greater contribution of fish-derived organic matter. Three-lips subsidised stream macroinvertebrates through multiple pathways: consumers fed on (1) periphyton increased by the fish nutrient subsidy, (2) fish-derived organic matter (such as fish carcasses and eggs), and (3) FPOM with fragmented periphyton and fish-derived organic matter constituents. Results showed that, given the complex food-web structures in alluvial streams, migratory fish influence stream ecosystems in complex ways. Further studies of the ecological influence of migratory fishes in alluvial streams are needed.

In the present study, the content of the metals cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) was determined in the sediment, the water, and different organs of macrophytes from six localities around Lake Skadar, across four different seasons of year. The aquatic macrophytes that have been used as bioindicator species in this study are Phragmites australis (an emerged species), Ceratophyllum demersum (a submerged species), and Lemna minor (a floating species). The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of metals in macrophyte tissues and also to discover the degree of bioaccumulation of the investigated metals, depending both on the location and on the season. The content of Co and Ni in the examined parts of the macrophytes was in the range of 0.04-8.78 and 0.30-28.5 ppm, respectively. The greatest content of the investigated metal in the organs of P. australis and C. demersum was recorded at the beginning of and during the growing season. Greater concentrations of metals in the tissue of L. minor were observed at the end of the growing season.

Intra-habitat Differences in the Composition of the Methanogenic Archaeal Community between the Microcystis-Dominated and the Macrophyte-Dominated Bays in Taihu Lake	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												A regime shift between a macrophyte-dominated clear state and a phytoplankton-dominated turbid state can have considerable impact on ecosystem structure and function of shallow lakes. However, very little is known about the response of the methanogenic archaeal community in the sediment during this regime shift. We investigated the methanogenic archaeal community at two sites in the large, shallow, eutrophic Taihu Lake over the course of one year. One site is located in Meiliang Bay and is dominated by Microcystis blooms, and the other site is located in East Taihu Bay and is dominated by aquatic macrophytes. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and phylogenetic analyses of archaeal 16S rRNA genes were used to analyze the methanogenic community. Higher ratio of methanogens in Archaea was observed in East Taihu Bay than in Meiliang Bay. The methanogenic archaeal community was dominated by the Methanobacteriales and the LDS cluster in macrophytes-dominated East Taihu Bay, while it was dominated by the Methanosarcinaceae, Methanobacteriales, and the LDS cluster in Microcystis-dominated Meiliang Bay. Clustering analysis of all of the samples revealed differences in the composition of the methanogenic archaeal communities between the two sites that were independent of seasonal variations. Further statistical analysis indicated that the chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration had a profound impact on the composition of the methanogenic archaeal community in Meiliang Bay, whereas it was primarily influenced by total organic carbon (TOC) levels in East Taihu Bay. Overall, this investigation demonstrates that intra-habitat differences in the composition of methanogenic archaeal communities are likely driven by changes in the available organic materials.

The water analysis showed low pH (5.69 +/- 0.16), high electrical conductivity (342 +/- 13.01 mu S m(-1)), high turbidity (33.2 +/- 9.407 NTU), and high phosphate concentrations (0.92 +/- 0.11 mg L-1) during the study period. The water quality index values calculated indicate that the park water during post-monsoon season is unfit for drinking. Thus, the degrading water quality poses a serious risk to the health of the deer and other species in the park. At present, Sangai in its natural habitat is threatened by pollution, encroachment, phoomdi thickness reduction, and inbreeding depression. To address the problem of inbreeding, Pumlen pat is considered as a second suitable natural habitat for the deer reintroduction program. During the study, water characteristics of the wetland showed similar characteristics as KLNP, i.e., low pH (5.86 +/- 0.30), high electrical conductivity (377.6 +/- 5.55 mu S m(-1)), high turbidity (32.36 +/- 4.91 NTU), and high phosphate concentrations (0.79 +/- 0.14 mg L-1). Likewise, sediments showed high TP accumulation that ranged from 197.03 +/- 0.75 to 332.88 +/- 0.99 mg kg(-1) for KLNP and 245.18 +/- 0.85 to 351.48 +/- 0.71 mg kg(-1) for Pumlen pat, respectively. Both, the lone natural habitat and the proposed habitat showed deteriorating water quality. As such, continuous monitoring of KLNP and Pumlen pat water and sediment quality should be a priority during the management practices to protect the endangered deer and health of the habitats for long-term conservation.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2023	30	30					76122	76142		10.1007/s11356-023-27603-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-27603-z		MAY 2023						37233936					WOS:000995355800009

Morphologically, Cottesmore pumpkinseed appear to have a more streamlined body than the two southerly populations for which data are available, but this may be due to the small body size of the Cottesmore population. Ontogenetically, 11 morphological characters grew isometrically, 12 allometrically, and 3 split-isometrically (i.e. a significant shift in proportional growth rate); however, the split 'break points' (between 49 and 60 mm SL) do not appear to correspond with any change in resource use or in biological process. Juvenile and age-specific growth were the lowest reported of any European population, and mean GSI was also low. Growth rate was highest in May and June, with condition highest in June, and with peak GSI in June and July. Mean age at maturity in the Cottesmore population was the highest reported in Europe. Dietary overlap was high amongst most age classes, and there was evidence of cannibalism in the population. Late maturity of the Cottesmore population was probably the result of relatively low temperatures during the growing season, slow growth, poor condition at age 3 (due to limited food resources), and intensive egg predation by high numbers of juveniles, giving a fitness advantage to late-maturing females.

However, little is known regarding the applicability of 210Pbex to elucidate contemporary seasonal sedimentary dynamics in reservoir water-level fluctuation zones (WLFZs). In the present study, sedimentary core and bulk sediments were collected from the WLFZ of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China, and the physical and chemical properties were determined. Results for 210Pbex activity, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen of bulk sediments indicate pronounced elevation-dependent spatial variation (p < 0.05), but 137Cs activity and particle composition show no systematic trends, allowing 210Pbex activity to be used to differentiate seasonal stratigraphy. For the sedimentary core, therefore, sediment layers with lower 210Pbex activity were inferred to represent sedimentation during wet seasons, when the 210Pbex concentration was diluted by a higher suspended sediment load, whereas sediment layers characterised by higher 210Pbex activity were ascribed to sedimentation during dry seasons, when the tranquil water favoured 210Pbex fallout to be absorbed by suspended sediments and then deposited in the WLFZ. Hereupon, temporal variation is observed in annual sedimentary thickness, with relatively low sedimentation rates during the initial stage (2006-2008) of the TGR impoundment, followed by relatively high sedimentation rates from 2009 to 2013. Over the period from 2014 to 2017, sedimentation rates were low because the suspended sediment was intercepted by upstream cascade reservoirs. Subsequently, sedimentation rates were higher during 2018-2019 as a consequence of an increase in extreme rainfall events. The findings herein highlight that 210Pbex-based seasonal stratification discrimination is effective approach to establish high-resolution sedimentary chronosequences and that net sedimentation rates in WLFZ are controlled by inflow suspended load of the TGR.

Clarifying long-term continuous changes of inland lake surface area and water storage in the sandy land is thus of great significance to the management of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. This study estimated changes in the surface area and water storage of small lakes in the sandy land during 1984-2021 using a multiple index threshold method and an empirical equation based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM (digital elevation model) data and Landsat 5/7/8 images. Hydro-meteorological variables were also incorporated to explore their potential relationship with changes in the lake elements. The lakes in the sandy land resemble stars or dots, with distinct inhomogeneity. Permanent lakes account for the majority of the total lake area, mostly distributed in the center and east of the study area, whereas most seasonal lakes are small water bodies, with surface areas of 0.1-0.5 km(2) and irregularly distributed. Lake surface area and water storage underwent frequent changes during the 38 years, and could be divided into three characteristic fluctuation phases. From 1984 to 1999, the lake surface area fluctuated greatly, and the water storage increased by approximately 0.3732 Gt, with an average expansion rate of 0.0572 Gt/y. Specifically, lakes with a surface area >2 km(2) primarily accounted for the expansion. From 1999 to 2004, the lake area shrank sharply to the lowest point, and the water storage capacity decreased by approximately 0.4003 Gt. From 2004 to 2021, the lake surface area and water storage tended to be stable. Annual fluctuations of lake surface area and water storage were mostly affected by precipitation and evapotranspiration, followed by vapor pressure deficit, wet day frequency, and temperature, which have significant periodicity and hysteresis.					; Singh, Vijay/AAH-9906-2020	Duan, Limin/0000-0002-4205-6868; 														2072-4292				MAY 24	2023	15	11							2719	10.3390/rs15112719	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15112719													WOS:001006253700001

In this study, the growth, diet, and reproductive biology of the Eurasian perch population were investigated with the aim of providing information that may serve as a basis for efficient resource management. A total of 240 specimens were caught during the monthly sampling campaign from November 2006 through October 2008. The length-to-weight relationships were W (t) = 8.4 x 10(-3) L (t) (3.10) (males) and W (t) = 4.1 x 10(-3) L (t) (3.36) (females). The parameters for the von Bertalanffy growth function for pooled sexes were L (a) = 33.17 cm, k = 0.20 year(-1), and t (0) = -1.34 year. Perch in Lake Varese spawn from April through May. Sexual maturity is reached when males are 2 years old, in females mostly when they are 3 years old. Relative fecundity (F (rel)) and absolute fecundity (F (abs)) were assessed for females. Fecundity values were similar to data reported for other European populations: females of age 2+ F (rel) = 102,457 +/- A 12,275, age 3+ F (rel) = 131,767 +/- A 5,891, and age 4+ F (rel) = 131,252 +/- A 15,555. Perch diet spectrum was wide and somewhat characterized by season. Perch in Lake Varese feed on macroinvertebrates, mainly Chironomidae and Chaoborus, zooplankton, and juvenile rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus.

Reproductive strategy of the jellyfish Aurelia aurita (Cnidaria Scyphomedusae) in the Suez Canal and its migration between the Red Sea and Mediterranean	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The life history of the common jellyfish A. aurita (Linnaeus) in the Suez Canal was investigated by monthly sampling over a 28 month period from September 2006 to December 2008. Young medusae of 2-3 cm diameter appeared during February/March. Growth was rapid. Some specimens of this cohort reached 16 cm and spawned by March/May and then decreased in size or died. Others reached a maximal size of 10 cm by September after which spawning took place. A few mature individuals remained after spawning in the next year but decreased in size. Release of ephyrae seems to be induced by a lowering of ambient environmental temperature to below 16 degrees C, with peak of release occurring in December-February. A drop in temperature may be the primary cue for strobilation in the Suez Canal. A. aurita seems to be an immigrant plankter to the Suez Canal, and much interest was focused on determining from which end of the canal these organisms were invading the opposite sea. However the canal itself along with its lakes, should also be considered as a substantial permanent habitat in its own right. The canal cannot be considered only as a funnel or corridor through which animals pass like ships from one sea to the other. A. aurita appears to enter the Suez Canal from the south via water currents; to do so it needs to be carried over a distance of 20 km along the canal from the Gulf of Suez into the Bitter Lakes, then pass across the Bitter Lakes before being carried a further 12 km along the canal into Lake Timsah. Transport of A. aurita southward along the canal from the Mediterranean is unlikely to take place during most seasons of the year because it would require transport against the dominant-water flow; it is possible only during a brief period (July-September) of reversed flow. Because the main part of the 80 km from the Red Sea is canalized, passive transport of A. aurita by water currents from the north could occur within a week during the brief period of reversed flow even at the low speed of 0.5 km hour(-1). Moreover conditions (barriers, obstacles and/or links) along the migratory route of the Suez Canal, in either direction, are likely to determine the success of passive transport of A. aurita.

Madhusoodana			Exploited fisheries resources of the Pampa River, Kerala, India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												River Pampa is one of the longest river systems of Kerala. Out of the 60 species of fishes reported from the river, 26 species, belonging to 5 orders and 21 genera contributed to the exploited fishery. The landings were represented by one endangered (Gonoproktopterus curumca), two each vulnerable (Horabagrus branchysoma and Channa diplogramma) and near threatened (NT) fish species (Wallago attu and Ompok bimaculatus). The annual average landings from this river was estimated to be 394.22 t. Highest landings were recorded during pre-monsoon season (194.48 t) and lowest in monsoon (38.97 t). Labeo dussumieri (75.98 t), Puntius sarana subnasutus (39.61 t), W. attu (37.65 t), Channa striatus (36.34 t) and Amblypharyngodon microlepis (34.32 t) were the dominant fishes in the landings. Catla catla (17.28 t) and Clarias gariepinus were the exotic species observed in the landings. Macrobrachium rosenbergii was the most priced species used for export. Among the landing centers, Parumala accounted for 65.3% of total landings, followed by Edathua (14.5%). About 77% of exploited fishery was accounted from the gillnets followed by seines (19%), castnets (3%) and hooks and lines (1%). Highest catch per unit hours (CPU) was recorded in seines in respect of A. microlepis (2.40 kg unit(-1)). The major fishery resources, fishing methods, catch per unit hour and various biodiversity threats prevalent in the Pampa River system are discussed in this paper.

Reproductive and Trophic Ecology of an Assemblage of Aquatic and Semi-Aquatic Snakes in Tonle Sap, Cambodia	COPEIA												We studied the reproductive and trophic ecology of a group of aquatic and semi-aquatic snakes that face severe hunting pressure in Cambodia. Over a two-year period we sampled hunters' catches, measuring and dissecting a total of 8982 specimens of seven snake species, five of which belong to the family Homalopsidae. The seven species-Enhydris enhydris, Enhydris longicauda, Homalopsis buccata, Enhydris bocourti, Erpeton tentaculatus, Xenochrophis piscator, and Cylindrophis ruffus-all Inhabit Tonle Sap Lake, the largest lake In South-East Asia. All species are sexually dimorphic In either body size or tall length. The larger species, E. bocourti and H. buccata, have a larger size at maturity, and the non-homalopsids, X. piscator and C. ruffus, have the highest and lowest fecundities, respectively. Clutch size increases significantly with female body size In all species, and with body condition In E. enhydris. Our data also suggest that relative Investment in reproduction Increases with size In E. enhydris, which has the largest sample size. All species except one are synchronized In their timing of reproduction with the seasonally receding flood waters of the lake. There was variation In both the frequency of feeding and the prey size and type among species, with the homalopsids more similar to one another than to the other non-homalopsid species. The prey to predator mass ratio ranged from 0.04 to 0.1 In the homalopsids, compared to 0.15 to 0.17 In the non-homalopsids. There was also variation in the feeding frequency between the sexes that differed between species and six species continued to feed while gravid. These detailed life history analyses can help provide a basis for assessing conservation options for these heavily exploited species.

The pollution of phthalate esters (PAEs) in water has attracted much attention, but limited research has been conducted on PAEs in Bosten Lake. The distribution of PAEs in fifteen sampling sites of surface water in the dry and flood seasons were investigated to explore the content level of PAEs in Bosten Lake, and the risk was evaluated. Seventeen PAEs were detected by GC-MS after liquid-liquid and solid-phase purification. Results showed that the content of n-ary sumation PAEs in the water during dry and flood seasons is ND-26.226 mu g/L and ND-7.179 mu g/L. The content of PAEs in the water of Bosten Lake is at a medium level. DBP and DIBP are the main PAEs. The content of PAEs is related to the physicochemical properties of water, and the physicochemical properties of water in dry season have a more serious impact on PAEs. PAEs in water mainly come from domestic pollution and chemical production. The results of health risk assessment indicate that PAEs in water do not pose a carcinogenic risk or a non carcinogenic risk to human, which can meet the conditions of Bosten Lake as a fishing ground and livestock base, but the pollution of PAEs cannot be ignored.

The data available on its phytoplanktic communities are limited, dispersed or outdated. This study presents floristic data obtained from the first long term monitoring survey ever made in Lake Kivu (over two and a half years). Samples were collected twice a month from the southern basin, and twice a year (once in each season) from the northern, eastern and western basins. In open lake habitats, the four basins presented similar species composition. The most common species were the pennate diatoms Nitzschia bacata Hust. and Fragilaria danica (Kutz.) Lange-Bert., and the cyanobacteria Planktolyngbya limnetica Lemm. and Synechococcus sp. The centric diatom Urosolenia sp. and the cyanobacterium Microcystis sp. were also very abundant, mostly near the surface under daily stratification conditions. Some typical low epilimnion/metalimnion species were Cryptaulax sp., Cryptomonas sp., Rhodomonas sp. and Merismopedia trolleri Bach. Vertical stratification appeared to be the most important factor of diversification. Limited changes were apparent in comparison with the situation described in 1937 after the first Belgian expeditions. No evidence of an effect of the planktivorous sardine Limnothrissa miodon Boulenger (introduced from Lake Tanganyika) on phytoplankton diversity is available.					; Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya/F-4549-2018; Sarmento, Hugo/W-3805-2019; Sarmento, Hugo/A-7655-2008	Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya/0000-0003-2439-3737; Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992													0181-1568	1776-0984				AUG	2007	28	3					245	269																WOS:000249548400003

Spatial and temporal variation in aquatic macroinvertebrates in the Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, USA	WETLANDS												Aquatic macroinvertebrates of the Okefenokee Swamp have been largely overlooked despite their ecological importance and value as water quality indicators. In a two-year study we analyzed taxon richness and abundances of individual macroinvertebrate taxa in the Okefenokee Swamp to assess temporal variation among seasons and spatial variation among five plant community habitats (marsh prairies, cypress forest, scrub-shrub thickets, deepwater lakes, and boat trails) and across six areas of the Okefenokee. Chironomid and ceratopogonid midges and water mites numerically dominated the macroinvertebrate community, and chironomids, dytiscid beetles, and libellulid dragonflies had the greatest generic richness. Multivariate analysis of macroinvertebrate community structure did not show clear patterns among seasons, habitats, or areas. Furthermore, few individual taxa had either spatial or temporal variation in abundance. Wetland macroinvertebrate communities were relatively homogenous across the Okefenokee Swamp possibly because conditions important to these organisms did not vary dramatically among habitats or seasons. Alternatively, most resident taxa might be ecological generalists able to exploit a broad range of conditions.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2007	27	1					127	140		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[127:SATVIA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[127:SATVIA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000245611100011

Characteristic wind speed distributions and reliability of the logarithmic wind profile	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE												Wind produces turbulence facilitating the exchange of pollutants and other environmentally important trace gases such as oxygen and greenhouse gases between stationary water bodies and the atmosphere. Whereas wind speeds continuously vary, different wind speed monitoring and characterization procedures have been used for the gas exchange studies. We assessed the impact of measurement time intervals, logarithmic wind speed profiles, and surface roughness values on wind characterizations. The Weibull probability density function effectively characterized yearly and seasonal wind speed distributions. It was not affected by various averaging lime intervals (1-60 min). However, averaging time interval of < 10 min was necessary for reliable characterizations of shorter-periods (< 3-5 days). Vertical wind speed variations were effectively described by logarithmic profile irrespective of atmospheric stability conditions. Interestingly, use of the logarithmic profile allowed the actual U-10 to be predicted with reasonable accuracy for a wide range of surface roughness values. This was true under all stability conditions. Thus, small time intervals and the logarithmic profile appear to be very robust and widely useful techniques.

Ostracod Mg/Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr geochemistry from Tibetan lake sediments: Implications for early to mid-Pleistocene Indian monsoon and catchment weathering	BOREAS												Lacustrine sediment serves as a valuable archive for tracing catchment weathering processes associated with past climatic and/or tectonic changes. High-resolution records of fossil ostracod Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios from a lake sediment core from the central Tibetan Plateau reveal a temporal link between lake-water chemistry and catchment weathering and distinct monsoonal oscillations over the early to mid-Pleistocene. Between 2.01 and 0.95 Ma, lake-water chemistry was dominated by a high proportion of carbonate weathering related to variations in the Indian monsoon, resulting in relatively low and constant ostracod 87Sr/86Sr but obvious fluctuations in Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and delta 18O. Across the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT), a significant increase in 87Sr/86Sr and frequently fluctuating ratios of ostracod Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and delta 18O are coincident with increases in both Chinese loess grain size and Arabian Sea lithogenic flux. This correlation indicates an increased glaciation and a strong monsoon seasonal contrast over the plateau. The increase in lake-water 87Sr/86Sr across the MPT highlights a change in catchment weathering patterns, rather than one in climate-enhanced weathering intensity, with an increased weathering of 87Sr-rich minerals potentially induced by marked extensive glaciation and strong seasonality in the central plateau.

J	Manca, M				Manca, Marina			Invasions and re-emergences: an analysis of the success of Bythotrephes in Lago Maggiore (Italy)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Bythotrephes was first seen in North America in 1982 (single individual, Lake Ontario) and noticed elsewhere in the Laurentian Great Lakes in abundance in 1985. Starting from 1987 it sharply increased in the open-water zooplankton of Lago Maggiore, reaching values never recorded in the past 40 years. Despite being native, the species' impact on Lago Maggiore was somewhat comparable to that observed in invaded North American lakes. The re-emergence led to an overall increase in invertebrate predation which became permanent five years after Bythotrephes' establishment, causing direct and indirect effects on the food web. Changes included a sharp decrease in the large.filter-feeder Daphnia, whose mortality rate increased, and consequently an increase in phytoplankton cell density; an increase in abundance and size of colonial rotifers with a decline in Leptodora abundance, and an overall decrease in zooplankton biomass were also observed. The increase of Bythotrephes in Lago Maggiore, however, was related to a shift in population phenology, which resulted in seasonal growth starting earlier and lasting longer. Daphnia phenology changed only later, suggesting that the impact was consequent to a temporary decoupling between Bythotrephes and its preferred prey. The shift in density and phenology became permanent. Over the long-term, however, potential competitors and prey were able to recover, reaching levels of abundance comparable to those recorded before the Bythotrephes' re-emergence. Such a response is likely attributable to behavioural adaptation mechanisms resulting in temporal and spatial displacement of potential competitors, predators and prey.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	1					76	82		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.76	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.76													WOS:000294320300010

One drainage basin (S-154) had a significant decreasing trend for mean monthly TP concentrations during the analysis period. A significant increase in TN concentrations was detected for four basins during this same time period. The S-154 basin which had the significant decreasing trend for TP also had the highest percentage of implemented Best Management Practices (BMPs) and the most rigorous types of nutrient control projects. These findings emphasize the need for continued implementation of intensive P management strategies. The increasing trend in TN for this watershed signals the need for added focus on reductions of TN in future nutrient source control projects and BMPs.																			1064-3389						2011	41			1			548	575	PII 933734834	10.1080/10643389.2010.530577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2010.530577													WOS:000287494000020

Performance of simple low-cost edge-of-field filters for mitigating P losses in surface runoff from agricultural fields	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Nutrient losses from agricultural fields are the largest sources of phosphorus (P) entering the Great Lakes in North America. Stacked conservation practices (CPs) may reduce P losses from individual fields. Simple low-cost, low disturbance, commercially available filters containing wood chips and phosphorus sorbing materials (PSM) were installed on two fields already using conservation practices in midwestern Ontario (ILD and LON) to quantify their ability to remove soluble reactive P (SRP), particulate P (PP), total P (TP) and total suspended sediments (TSS) from surface runoff. Laboratory tests on unused (new) and used (field) filter materials were also conducted to estimate P sorption and remobilization potentials. During the two-year study period, the filter retained 0.018 kg ha-1 of SRP, 0.38 kg ha-1 of PP, 0.4 kg ha-1 of TP and 8.75 kg ha-1 of TSS from surface runoff at the ILD site. In contrast, although the filter at LON removed 37 kg ha-1 of TSS and 0.07 kg ha-1 of PP, it released 0.22 kg ha-1 of SRP and 0.15 kg ha-1 TP. A reduction in filter efficacy was observed over time, particularly at the site with greater cumulative surface runoff and larger runoff events (LON). The majority of the SRP retained by the filter was held in a loosely bound form, thus, susceptible to P remobilization. The results of this study demonstrate that low-cost, simple PSMs have some potential to retain P from surface runoff, but their efficacy may decline over time and their P retention capability may differ with site hydrology (e.g., runoff volumes and velocity) and P supply.

Compound Vulnerabilities: The Intersection of Climate Variability and HIV/AIDS in Northwestern Tanzania	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Nsisha, a rural village located close to the shores of Lake Victoria in northwestern Tanzania, this article analyzes how climate change and variability intersect with other stressors that affect rural livelihoods, particularly HIV/AIDS. The analysis integrates theories of vulnerability from both climate and HIV/AIDS literatures to show how these intersecting stressors compound livelihood vulnerability in complex ways. Climate change and variability are linked to declining agricultural yields and an increase in food and nutrition insecurity and poor health in this region. This situation heightens poverty and susceptibility to HIV/AIDS, compromising people's abilities to cope and adapt. Because of social dynamics, single mothers and their children are particularly affected by these compound vulnerabilities. Climate change and variability are significant contributing vulnerability factors that sustain and exacerbate asymmetrical poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and HIV/AIDS. By describing the links between vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and climate variability, findings highlight the importance of holistic and localized approaches to adaptation, instead of trying to isolate single issues. Prioritization of multidisciplinary research focusing on the socially differentiated and gendered distribution of vulnerability specifically in regard to poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and HIV/AIDS is recommended as a means to enrich the understanding of climate change vulnerability. Adaptation strategies should address how climatic shifts interact with generalized poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, health, and gendered vulnerability in areas most affected.					; Crane, Todd/G-5269-2012	Crane, Todd/0000-0002-4395-7545; 													1948-8327	1948-8335				JAN	2014	6	1					9	21		10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00052.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00052.1													WOS:000335646000002

A case study of Lake Victoria Basin in Kenya	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Reliable estimation of flood magnitudes corresponding to required return periods, vital for structural design purposes, is impacted by lack of hydrological data in the study area of Lake Victoria Basin in Kenya. Use of regional information, derived from data at gauged sites and regionalized for use at any location within a homogenous region, would improve the reliability of the design flood estimation. Therefore, the regional index flood method has been applied. Based on data from 14 gauged sites, a delineation of the basin into two homogenous regions was achieved using elevation variation (90-m DEM), spatial annual rainfall pattern and Principal Component Analysis of seasonal rainfall patterns (from 94 rainfall stations). At site annual maximum series were modelled using the Log normal (LN) (3P), Log Logistic Distribution (LLG), Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Log Pearson Type 3 (LP3) distributions. The parameters of the distributions were estimated using the method of probability weighted moments. Goodness of fit tests were applied and the GEV was identified as the most appropriate model for each site. Based on the GEV model, flood quantiles were estimated and regional frequency curves derived from the averaged at site growth curves. Using the least squares regression method, relationships were developed between the index flood, which is defined as the Mean Annual Flood (MAF) and catchment characteristics. The relationships indicated area, mean annual rainfall and altitude were the three significant variables that greatly influence the index flood. Thereafter, estimates of flood magnitudes in ungauged catchments within a homogenous region were estimated from the derived equations for index flood and quantiles from the regional curves. These estimates will improve flood risk estimation and to support water management and engineering decisions and actions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The contents of Cu and Cr in the deep solutions were safe according to the environmental quality standard for groundwater, but contents of other metals might lead to groundwater contamination, especially for Cd. The release of metals in surface soil was increased for NFI because the wetting-drying cycles in NFI fields resulted in less reluctant and high decomposition and mineralization of soil organic matter in surface soil, and consequently enhanced the release of soil metals into solutions. Seasonal metals leaching losses in NFI fields were 44.9-53.8% lower than in Fl, due to the large reduction in both deep seepage rates and metals concentrations in deep soil solutions. Higher release of metals in NFI surface soils might lead to higher bioavailability of micronutrients (Cu and Zn) to crops, but higher risks in toxic metals (Pb, Cr, and Cd) uptakes.					xu, junzeng/I-9266-2014; Wei, Qi/JJF-3393-2023														1230-1485	2083-5906					2014	23	6					2279	2286																WOS:000347510700046

For both sites, total N (TN), total P (TP) and TN:TP mass ratios in water, sediment and macrophytes were used to examine (1) spatial variations within the systems, (2) differences between the systems and (3) seasonal variations. The TN concentration from the discharge point at the Kiruna site was about seven times higher than at the Boliden discharge point, while the TP concentration was 10 times lower than in the discharge point at the Boliden site. The majority of the studied lakes showed elevated biomass of phytoplankton, with maximum values found in Lake Brutrasket (Boliden). Mining activities have affected the nutrient regime of the two recipients by contributing to elevated TN and TP concentrations and TN:TP mass ratios as well as elevated production of phytoplankton and macrophytes compared to the reference sites. Depending on the NH4 concentration in the effluent at the Boliden site, water column TN:TP mass ratios shifted from being >22, indicating P-deficiency, to between 9 and 22, indicating a transition from N- to P-deficiency (co-limitation). However, water column TN:TP mass ratios at the Kiruna site always indicated P-deficiency, while TN:TP mass ratios of macrophytes indicate that both sites may vary from N- to P-limitation. The study suggests that for the design of efficient monitoring programmes and remediation measures, it is important to consider the major N and P species in water, phytoplankton, sediment and macrophytes.

The baroclinic response to wind in a small two-basin lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Field data and two linear layered models were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in a small elongated two-basin lake, Amisk Lake (Alberta, Canada). For the first vertical baroclinic mode, wind-forced horizontal modes were simulated using a dynamic two-layer variable cross-section (TVC) model. The first horizontal mode, H1, was found to dominate the exchange between the two basins of Amisk Lake. The highest velocities associated with H1 occurred in the constricted channel connecting the two basins. This high velocity led to strong damping which brought H1 in near-resonance with the diurnal wind despite a difference in periods. Along with H1, the second horizontal mode, H2, was detected at a thermistor mooring. The TVC showed that H2 resulted from the coupling between along-thalweg wind distribution and the bathymetry of Amisk Lake. The damping for H2 was found to be weaker than for H1, likely because of weaker bottom drag in the connecting channel. The evolution of vertical H1 modes were simulated using a multi-layered box model. In response to wind pulses, the first vertical mode V1H1 initially dominated over higher vertical modes causing two-layer exchange. Following the faster decay of V1H1, higher vertical modes shifted the exchange to three and more layers. Our study shows the importance of the coupling between wind stress distribution and lake bathymetry in exciting horizontal modes, reveals the effect of damping on resonance with wind, and explains the evolution of exchange associated with vertical modes.

SEASONAL VARIATION IN OFFSPRING SEX RATIO IN THE SNOWY PLOVER	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												The Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus) is unique in being a determinate layer of an odd modal clutch size and in having a variable mating system in which female brood desertion occurs regularly. These traits make determining Snowy Plover offspring sex ratios important not only for long-term population stability, as the species is of conservation concern, but also for application to sex allocation theory. In this study, we determined Snowy Plover offspring sex ratios, examined differential costs of producing male and female offspring, and evaluated sex ratio variation in relation to maternal condition, habitat condition, and time during the nesting season on saline lakes of the Southern High Plains of Texas. Examination of 245 chicks from 118 clutches during 1999-2000 and 2008-2009 showed that male offspring were more costly to produce than female offspring; however, offspring sex ratio did not differ from parity, but was slightly male-biased in most years. The probability of producing a male offspring was greater both earlier and later in the breeding season than in the middle. As the availability of saline lake surface water and the subsequent availability of food vary unpredictably throughout the breeding season, depending on precipitation events, we suggest that sex ratio adjustment in unpredictable environments may not be straightforward and may follow nonlinear models and/or vary annually. The effects such changes in sex ratios may have on population growth and stability remain unknown.

The Yalong River will be dramatically impacted hydrologically and ecologically because more than 60% of the runoff will be diverted. An ecohydrological model was used to evaluate the impacts of the project on river corridor and wetland in this study. Schizothorax is a typical plateau river species and was used as the indicator species for assessment of the impact of water transfer project. The model simulated the habitat area of Schizothorax in the reach between the Reba Dam and the Ganzi Hydrology Station on the Yalong River. The Reba Dam, A'an Dam and Renda Dam will be constructed in the Yalong River for enhancing the water level for water diversion into the Yellow River. The velocity, channel width, runoff, and water depth will be reduced due to the water transfer, especially during flood season. The reduction in the velocity, channel width, runoff and water depth will occur mainly in the reach near the three dams and the reduction will be reduced to a minimum level in a distance about 100 km downstream of the dams. The maximum net water loss of Kasha Lake is only 1197200 m(3), only 0.3% of runoff flowing into the lake. The project cannot bring adverse effect on the lake. The habitat area of Schizothorax in the Yalong River might be reduced if the water was transferred from the Reba Dam. The habitat area of this species will be reduced more than 40%.

Consecutive breeding locations were obtained for eleven female and 23 male King Eiders. All females exhibited breeding site fidelity by returning to sites within 15 km of first year breeding areas on the North Slope of Alaska. Breeding locations of males in a subsequent year were located on average > 1000 km from their prior breeding sites and were primarily outside Alaska, on the coasts of Russia and Canada. Second-year wing molt locations were obtained for two female and six male King Eiders. Wing molt sites of males were located 6.2 +/- 3.1 km apart on average in successive years, while female wing molt locations averaged almost 50 km apart. Our results demonstrate site fidelity of female King Eiders to a breeding area on the North Slope of Alaska, document the dispersal of male King Eiders between breeding seasons, and present the first evidence for wing molt site fidelity in males.

J	Adamczuk, M				Adamczuk, Malgorzata			Spatial distribution of juvenile and adult stages of limnetic Cladocera in relation to selected environmental factors	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Environmental factors have a varied impact on the development of juvenile and adult Cladocera, depending on their different physiological conditions and body size. The values of these factors alter spatially and temporarily thus implying that they play a role in the spatial distribution of the pre-reproductive and potentially reproductive stages of cladocerans. The aim of the study was to determine seasonal and spatial variations in the distribution of juvenile and adult individuals of limnetic Cladocera in relation to selected physico-chemical factors (temperature, conductivity, pH, concentration of dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total suspended solids) and fish predation pressure (measured by Chesson's coefficient lambda) in deep Lake Piaseczno (eastern Poland). Adult Cladocera displayed spatial distribution related to fish predation pressure. The species selectively eaten, B. coregoni and D. longispina, and non-selectively eaten, D. cucullata, selected the pelagic zone to exist, whereas those avoided by fish, D. brachyurum and B. longirostris, were evenly distributed in the littoral and pelagic zone. Juvenile cladocerans were strongly impacted by physico-chemical factors. Juvenile Daphnia, Diaphanosoma and B. longirostris showed preferences to biotic zones similar to the adults but differed in their habitat choices. Juvenile and adult stages of B. coregoni differed in their distribution, indicating that adult individuals impacted by high predation pressure alternatively modified their habitat selection. Principal component analysis (PCA) ordination showed a seasonal tendency for the spatial segregation of the cladocerans, suggesting that possible competitive interactions between the studied cladocerans may also influence their distribution patterns.

Depth segregation of deepwater ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) in Lake Michigan during 1930-1932 and range expansion of Coregonus hoyi into deeper waters after the 1990s	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2008	Advances in Limnology				10th Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	AUG, 2008	Winnipeg, CANADA					The deepwater cisco (Coregonus spp.) assemblage in Lake Michigan was among the most diverse in the Laurentian Great Lakes. During the 1930s, seven species were identified, but by the early 1970s, six species were extirpated, primarily due to overfishing, leaving only one species (C. hoyi). To quantify the degree of depth segregation that occurred within this assemblage, we applied generalized additive models (GAM) to gillnet data collected in 1930-1932 from the R/V Fulmar. Our results generally supported findings published earlier. C. hoyi and C. reighardi typically exhibited peak catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the shallowest depths (50-68 m) and C. kiyi and C. nigripinnis always exhibited peak CPUE in the deepest depths (127-150 m). The peak CPUEs for C. alpenae and C. zenithicus, species described previously as occupying waters of "intermediate" depth, occurred at intermediate depths (88-94 m) in the northern region and at shallow depths (50 m) in the southern region. The nearly complete overlap in their depth distributions was consistent with a prior hypothesis that C. alpenae was synonymous with C. zenithicus. The depth of peak CPUE of C. johannae, previously described as inhabiting intermediate depths, was highly variable, ranging from very shallow (50 in) to very deep (150 m), depending on region and season. We found no clear evidence that deepwater ciscoes changed depths for spawning. We found little evidence that deepwater cisco species collected in gillnets during 1930-1932 were distributed by depth as a function of fish size. C. hoyi collected by bottom trawl from 1974 to 2007 exhibited a positive relationship between depth and fish size. When we applied a GAM to the 1974-2007 trawl data, we found that C. hoyi shifted to markedly deeper waters from 1988-1991 to 2004-2007. Based on the ability of C. hoyi to shift to deeper depths, this species should occupy deeper waters in the lower Great Lakes (Erie, Ontario) should managers seek reintroduction of native deepwater ciscoes.					; Krause, Ann/GRT-0163-2022	Bunnell, David/0000-0003-3521-7747; 													1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						3	+																WOS:000313086600001

A quadratic temperature profile based on the layer mean and base temperature is assumed in each layer and extended to the surface. The model is tested at two sites on the Tibetan Plateau near Nam Co Lake during four days during the 2009 Monsoon season. In comparison to a two-layer model without explicit surface temperature estimate, there is a greatly reduced delay in diurnal flux cycles and the modelled surface temperature is much closer to observations. Comparison with a SVAT model and eddy covariance measurements shows an overall reasonable model performance based on RMSD and cross correlation comparisons between the modified and original model. A potential limitation of the model is the need for careful initialisation of the initial soil temperature profile, that requires field measurements.

Submerged aquatic vegetation in the Bay of Quinte: Response to decreased phosphorous loading and Zebra Mussel invasion	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Originally mesotrophic, the Bay of Quinte ecosystem has experienced eutrophication since the 1940s, which resulted in the decline of once-lush submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds in the upper bay by the mid-1960s. Since 1972, twelve SAV surveys have been conducted along ten index transects, recording:% cover, distance SAV beds extended from shore (extent), maximum depth of colonization (Zc), species composition, and, in later years, wet plant biomass. Offshore secchi depth and ?par, (the vertical light extinction rate (m-1) for photosynthetically active radiation), were also recorded either weekly or bi-weekly during the growing season since 1972. During this time, two major changes occurred within the bay: the reduction in point-source phosphorus (P-control) loadings in 1978 and the 1993 invasion by Dreissenid Mussel. SAV response to these changes varied temporally and spatially, with the shallow upper bay showing the greatest response, particularly after Zebra Mussels establishment. In the upper bay, mean secchi depth increased by 8% from 1.2 m prior to P-control (pre-P), to 1.3 m after P-control (post-P) and further increased by 46% to 1.9 m after Dreissena establishment (post-D). Upper bay SAV responded to these invasive species with increases in the means of three variables: Zc from 1.6 to 3.5 m, extent from 114 m to 417 m and wet biomass from 50 g m-2 to 962 g m-2. SAV in the middle and lower bays were in better condition in 1972, with pre-P cover in excess of 50% and Zc of 2.6 and 3.7 m, respectively. SAV cover did increase in the post-D (1994 to 2007) period by approximately 25% and Zc increased to 3.7 and 6.5 m, but the narrow fringing strip of shallower water along the shore in these two deeper bays limited substantial increases in bed extent. Both water clarity and basin morphometry strongly influenced SAV distribution and abundance within the Bay of Quinte.

The HNF abundance in the anoxic layer was always lower than in the oxic layer during the study period. Ingestion of fluorescently labeled 0.5 mu m diameter beads by the anaerobic HNF in the anoxic layer indicated bacterivory by HNF. The specific ingestion rates in the anoxic layers were generally similar to those taken from the oxic layer, with some exceptions. Our data thus suggested that anaerobic HNF were bacterial consumers with high potential bacterivory comparable to that of aerobic HNF in Lake Suigetsu. Bacterial turnover rates by HNF grazing in the oxic layer were estimated to be as high as similar to 10% d(-1) of the bacterial standing stock. In contrast, the rates in the anoxic layer were <1% d(-1) due to the low density of HNF in the anoxic layer. Our data thus provide a valuable contribution to understanding the structure and function of microbial food webs in anoxic aquatic environments.

Because they are exposed directly to nutrients and contaminants exported from the watershed, littoral communities such as periphyton may respond quickly to watershed disturbances. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the response of periphyton to watershed logging using a BACI (before-after control-impact) statistical approach and to develop a predictive tool to facilitate the elaboration of practical logging policies aimed at reducing Hg loading to lakes. In this study, we compare the periphyton biomass in 18 boreal Canadian Shield lakes, as well as their total mercury and methylmercury levels. During the ice-free season from 2000 to 2002, eight of these lakes were monitored before and after logging, with the other 10 lakes serving as controls. The BACI statistical analyses reveal a significant impact of logging on periphyton biomass (decrease; 0.6- to 1.5-fold) and methylmercury accumulation (increase; 2- to 9.6-fold). This study demonstrates that periphyton responds quickly to disturbances of the watershed. Our results suggest that the periphyton and watershed characteristics could serve as good management tools and that logging should be limited in watersheds with a mean slope below 7.0%.

Stable hydrogen-isotope ratios in beetle chitin: preliminary European data and re-interpretation of North American data	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Beetle exoskeletons contain chitin, a poly amino-sugar that is biosynthesized incorporating hydrogen isotopes from diet and water. As the stable isotope ratios D/H (or H-2/H-1, expressed as delta D values) of precipitation and diet are jointly influenced by climate, the biochemically recorded hydrogen-isotope ratio in fossil beetle exoskeleton has the potential to be used for paleoclimatic reconstruction. New delta D data from modern beetles are presented as a preliminary database for Europe, with a re-evaluation of earlier North American data. We present correlated matrices of delta D values in modern beetle chitin and modern precipitation to demonstrate the concept. We review the pertinent literature to highlight the history, utility, and likely future research directions for the use of chitin's stable isotopes in entomological paleoclimatology.

J	Hung, CC; Warnken, KW; Santschi, PH				Hung, CC; Warnken, KW; Santschi, PH			A seasonal survey of carbohydrates and uronic acids in the Trinity River, Texas	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Due to their potential significance as indicators of ecological health, the biogeochemical cycling of carbohydrates and uronic acids was investigated in the Trinity River Texas, during 2000 2001. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total carbohydrates (TCHO), polysaccharides (PCHO), monosaccharides (MCHO), uronic acids (URA), as well as of oxygen, suspended particulate matter, nutrients and trace metals (Cu, Pb, Cd) were assessed at various stages of discharge. TCHO/DOC ratios, as well as nutrient and hydrogen ion concentrations, were inversely related to temperature, which suggests that biological processes in Lake Livingston, the largest freshwater reservoir along the Trinity River, are not only regulating nutrient concentrations but also the preferential degradation of carbohydrates over that of bulk DOC. However, uronic acids were selectively preserved during this temperature controlled biological process, as is evident from the positive correlation of URA/TCHO ratios and temperature. Thus, uronic acids are more refractory compounds than bulk TCHO. Significant correlations between TCHO and dissolved Cu, Pb and Cd suggest that their pathways and cycles are linked through common sources or removal processes.

Concentration and delta(13)C for both porewater and emitted methane were obtained from June-September for two systems characterized by different plant assemblages and hydrologic regimes: a Carer-dominated fen and a Sphagnum-dominated, forested bog crest. Average methane emissions were higher in the fen than at the bog crest across the entire growing season. Fen porewater methane concentrations were maintained at consistently low levels in the upper one-third of the peat column, and emitted methane was substantially C-13-depleted (by approx. 6 parts per thousand) relative to shallow porewater methane, trends which are characteristic of passive plant-mediated transport of rhizospheric methane to the atmosphere. Fen porewater delta(13)C-CH4 values in shallow pear (approx. -59 parts per thousand) suggest that microbial respiration was primarily driven by acetate fermentation. CO2 reduction became more important deeper in the peat column with delta(13)C-CH4 values ranging from approx. -65 to -69 parts per thousand between 1 and 2.8 m. In contrast to the fen, porewater methane concentrations in the bog were usually at near-maximum levels just below the water table. delta(13)C values for emitted CH4 in the bog were enriched relative to those for shallow porewater CH4 by approx. 10 parts per thousand, indicating that methane was subject to oxidation as it exited from the pear via passive diffusion. Methanogenesis in the peat at the bog crest appears to have been substrate-limited, with porewater delta(13)C-CH4 (approx. -67 parts per thousand) suggestive of CO2 reduction at all depths.

J	Rangarajan, R; Athavale, RN				Rangarajan, R; Athavale, RN			Annual replenishable ground water potential of India - an estimate based on injected tritium studies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Natural recharge is a vital parameter to be known for ground water budgeting, management and modelling. Percolation of a portion of the rainfall, through the vadose zone, is the principal source of natural recharge to the aquifer systems in India. The tritium injection method, based on piston flow model, is particularly suitable for quantifying the downward Bur of moisture in the vadose zone and for measuring natural recharge in Indian climatic condition, where about 80% of the annual rainfall is received as pulses and occurs during the four monsoon months from June to September. Natural recharge measurements, using the tritium injection method, have been carried out in India during the last 25 years, in several basins and watersheds, located in varying climatic and hydrogeological situations. The mean natural recharge values for 35 study areas, well distributed over 17 major river basins are presented. The recharge rates range from 24 to 198 mm yr(-1) or 4.1 to 19.7% of the local average seasonal rainfall. The natural recharge data are grouped into four main hydrogeological provinces, namely granitic, basaltic, sedimentary and alluvial and the regression equations between rainfall and natural recharge are derived for each province. These equations enable one to determine the approximate value of natural recharge in any watershed/basin from the rainfall data for any year. The regression equations are used to compute the total annual replenishment of ground water reserves of the country, for an average rainfall year. The calculated annual input is about 476 x 10(9) m(3) yr(-1). This can be considered as a minimal quantity, as it represents the natural recharge due to precipitation alone and does not account for seepage from ponds, lakes, stream bed, canals and return flow from surface water irrigation.

J	Houser, C; Greenwood, B				Houser, C; Greenwood, B			Profile response of a lacustrine multiple barred nearshore to a sequence of storm events	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Profile change in a lacustrine multiple-barred nearshore was investigated over the ice-free season of 2001/2002 at Burley Beach on the southeastern shore of Lake Huron in order to identify the feedback mechanisms between the pre-existing morphology and the wave forcing and the consequence of those feedbacks to the behaviour of the nearshore environment. The characteristics of the offshore wave field were monitored using a Falmouth Scientific combined 3D-ACM wave recorder and pressure transducer. Supplemental wave data were downloaded from a 3-m discus buoy operated by the National Data Buoy Center, similar to 75 km to the NW of the study site. The three nearshore bars were in a quasi-equilibrium state through a large part of the ice-free season, with dramatic changes occurring during relatively moderate storm events that followed much larger storms in late October. A comparison of the incident wave field with changes in the nearshore profile through canonical correlation analysis indicates that the morphology responds to the distribution of the significant, root-mean-square (rms) and average wave heights between surveys. The threshold between bar decay and onshore bar migration and growth is associated with the onset of breaking of the rms wave at the bar crest (H-rms h(cr)(-1) approximate to 0.3-0.4). The threshold between onshore and offshore migration is associated with the onset of breaking of the average wave at the bar crest (H-avg h(cr)(-1) approximate to 0.3-0.4), coincident with complete dissipation of the significant wave over the lakeward slope of the bar (H-s h(cr)(-1) > 0.6). Inshore wave data collected during an instrumented study at the same site revealed that the middle and inner bars remained at the threshold of onshore and offshore migration over a wide range of offshore significant wave heights (0.8 to 2.4 in) prior to the October storms. This self-organised equilibrium is a result of changes to the incident wave distribution through breaking on the outer bar. It is concluded that the prediction of bar response requires an understanding of the feedback between the bar and the local wave distribution in addition to an understanding of the feedback associated with the profile as a whole.

This study investigated seasonal variation of human retinol concentrations in Chadian mobile pastoralists to identify critical time periods for interventions addressing vitamin A deficiency. The repeated cross-sectional study design used convenience sampling during three seasons to include 327 Fulani, Gorane and Arab adult mobile pastoralists in nine camps in the Lake Chad area. Human blood and pooled cattle milk retinol concentrations were rapidly assessed by portable flourometer (iCheck (TM)). Linear regression models with random effects for correlation within camps were applied with human retinol concentration as outcome. Logistic regression models, with camp as random effect, were evaluated for the outcome human retinol deficiency. Human seasonal means were 2.14 mu mol/L (95% Cl 1.82-2.46) in rainy, 0.99 mu mol/L (95% CI 0.91-1.07) in cold and 1.86 mu mol/L (95% CI 1.63-2.09) in dry season. Retinol concentration and deficiency varied according to season and ethnic group. Average values were highest in Gorane during rainy and in Fulani in the cold and dry seasons. Arabs had lowest average values in all seasons. Retinol deficiency (<0.70 mu mol/L) was found in 15% of study participants in the dry, 25% in the rainy and 32% in the cold season. Retinol concentrations varied according to age, sex, milk consumption level and pooled cattle milk retinol concentration. Effect sizes varied and not all were statistically significantly different. Pooled cattle milk retinol concentrations varied seasonally and were positively associated to human retinol concentrations. This study establishes seasonal variation in human blood and pooled cattle milk retinol concentrations in Chad, demonstrating a linkage from animals to humans through milk. Rapid analysis using portable technology is feasible in remote populations under harsh climatic conditions.

After originally infesting Lake Victoria 14 (Uganda), it eventually spread into the Winam gulf, where its proliferation was spectacular, resulting in an enormous public outcry. The aim of this study was to find out how a beach/bay covered by a weed carpet affected the life of a lakeshore community, if there were any seasonal changes in carpet sizes and to establish if the water hyacinth is a friend or an enemy. Surveys were conducted in selected beaches between June 1995 and November 1999. When surveys were complete, it became clear that this weed is nomadic, except in lagoons and beaches that had little external interference. The open waters remained generally clear due to constant wave action. Interviews conducted on selected beaches/bays indicated that weed carpets impacted both positively and negatively, i.e. they disrupted fishing activities, transport, irrigation, water treatment. enhanced breeding grounds for vectors of human diseases, impacted on biodiversity and had become a source of raw materials for making furniture, paper and artefacts. After successful biological control by the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KART), resurgence and succession were observed. The impact of water hyacinth on the life of the lakeshore communities in the Winam gulf is serious and needs to be quantified. Further research is necessary to establish whether this weed is an enemy or a friend of the lakeshore communities.																			0075-9511					MAY	2004	34	1-2					105	109		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80028-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80028-8													WOS:000222030800014

Altaf			Tree-ring growth varies with climate and stand density in a red pine plantation forest in the Great Lakes region of North America	DENDROCHRONOLOGIA												Red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) was widely planted across the Great Lakes region of North America in the early 20th century to restore tree cover to degraded forest and agricultural lands. In this study, a dendrochronological assessment of radial growth response to climate was conducted in an 82-year-old, previously thinned red pine plantation forest in southern Ontario, Canada. Climate-growth relationships were analyzed at multi-monthly and annual time scales using a 72-year residual growth chronology (1942-2013). Warmer temperatures and periodic drought during the current and previous growing seasons were associated with decreased growth, while higher precipitation during the early part of the current growing season was associated with increased growth. Moving interval correlation analysis of long-term trends indicated that climate-growth relations were temporally unstable due to thinning and variation in climate over the length of the chronology. The correlation between climate and growth was stronger when stand density was relatively high and diminished in the two decades following thinning. These results indicate that growth of red pine plantations near the species' southern range limit may be much reduced if exposed to a warmer, drier future climate and that periodic thinning can help mitigate the impacts of future climate change on these plantations.

Even though biotic and abiotic factors control ecosystem processes, their relative influence may vary according to ecosystem dynamics. In flood and coastal plains, these dynamics are mainly represented by flood pulses and hydroregime, respectively. The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of abiotic and biotic factors for the ecosystem processes represented by zooplankton secondary production (SP), biomass (ZB), and resource use efficiency (RUE) in lentic waterbodies subjected to different hydrological regimes. We hypothesised that abiotic factors would more strongly determine the ecosystem processes in temporary waterbodies and floodplain lakes, given their greater susceptibility to environmental changes. Biotic factors would be more relevant in coastal lagoons due to their greater temporal stability. Sampling was undertaken quarterly over 1 year in eight coastal lagoons, 10 temporary ponds and five floodplain lakes. The environments were characterised in relation to limnological variables, and zooplankton functional divergence, functional dispersion (FDis), functional evenness, functional richness, and taxonomic richness were measured. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to verify seasonal changes in SP, ZB, RUE, functional diversity, richness, and abiotic factors. Linear mixed models were used to determine which abiotic and biotic factors were the most important for ZB, SP, and RUE. In the coastal lagoons, RUE differed over time. In the temporary ponds and floodplain lakes, no seasonal significant differences were observed for any of the zooplankton production variables. The linear mixed model analyses showed that models composed mainly of biotic factors were better fitted to the production variables. For coastal lagoons, phytoplankton density affected ZB, SP, and RUE increasing them by 9.9 mg DW/m(3), 12.4 mg DW/m(3), and 1.23, respectively. For temporary ponds, FDis lowered ZB by 6.9 mg DW/m(3)and taxonomic richness increased SP and RUE by 14.2 mg DW/m(3)and 1.17, respectively. For floodplain lakes, FDis lowered ZB it by 9.9 mg DW/m(3)and functional divergence lowered RUE by 0.81. The present study demonstrates that biotic factors are the main determinants of ecosystem processes in neotropical lentic waterbodies, irrespective of their annual hydrological regimes. Complementarity effects and high functional diversity are more important in more stable environments, whereas redundancy and low functional diversity prevail in environments subject to more frequent environmental changes. Biotic factors play a major role in ensuring the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and indicate the important role of biodiversity in enabling ecosystem states to be maintained after disturbances and to prevent changes in ecosystem processes.					; Petry, Ana/J-6851-2012; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019; Bonecker, Claudia/D-5946-2013; Setubal, Rayanne/HSG-7823-2023; Petry, Ana Cristina/J-6851-2012	Nova, Clarice Casa/0000-0003-0352-2595; Bonecker, Claudia/0000-0003-4338-9012; Setubal, Rayanne/0000-0003-4655-7894; Bozelli, Reinaldo/0000-0001-9916-1629; Petry, Ana Cristina/0000-0001-9039-2738													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2020	65	8					1376	1391		10.1111/fwb.13506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13506													WOS:000549430200006

Razi			Properties and Variation between Three Forest Types in Tropical Watershed Forest of Chini Lake, Peninsular Malaysia	SAINS MALAYSIANA												Three forest types were recognized at Chini watershed namely inland, seasonal flood and riverine forests. The soil physico-chemical characteristics from the three forest types were investigated to determine the soil properties variation within a landscape scale. Thirty sampling stations were established, represented by fourteen inland, nine stations in seasonal flood forest and seven in riverine forest. In each station, three soil samples were taken at 0-15 cm depth by using an auger. The study showed 71% of the soil in the inland forest was found to be dominated by clay, 44% of the soil in the seasonal flood forest by clay loam and 42% of the soil in the riverine forest was dominated by silty clay. The pH of all three types of forest studied was acidic and insignificantly different. Organic matter content in the study sites was moderate. The mean of electric conductivity (EC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) values in the studied soils were low. Based on ANOVA, there were significant differences of the available P and K, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations and electrical conductivity amongst the three forest types (p<0.05). Cluster analysis showed that the variations of the soil physico-chemical characteristics between the three forest types were low thus indicating that the soil physico-chemical investigated in this study were not the only main contributing factors in floristic variation of the three forest types in Chini watershed.

Agricultural Practice and Pesticide Residues in Soils and Pool Sediments from the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve Area in Benin, West Africa	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												One consequence of the shift in land use from traditional food production to cotton production in West Africa is the application of different pesticides. The influence of this practice on the formation of pesticide residues in soils and sediments of seasonal dry pools was investigated in 2008 and 2009 in the region of the Pendjari biosphere reserve in Benin. The protected park area, the buffer zone with some sporadic agricultural practice and the agricultural zone of the Pendjari region were compared. GC-electron capture detector method was used to analyze selected pesticides covering the officially supplied pesticides and some organochlorine compounds. Residues of - and -endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, chlorpyrifos, p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were detected in soils of cotton fields and in sediments from adjacent pools within the agricultural and buffer zone. Concentrations were in the range of below detection limit (DL) to 150 mu g/kg dry mass (dm) for endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate together and of below DL to 12 mu g/kg dm for chlorpyrifos. In pool sediments, concentrations of total endosulfan were in a range of below DL to 47 mu g/kg dm. The occurrence of the pesticides was directly linked to the cotton growing season. No residues were detected at the beginning of cotton growing season. Concentration levels of p,p-DDE were in the range of below DL to 12 mu g/kg dm. No pesticide residues were found in the protected park zone.																			1863-0650	1863-0669				NOV	2014	42	11					1593	1603		10.1002/clen.201200371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.201200371													WOS:000344777700014
J	Adhikari, NP; Adhikari, S				Adhikari, Namita Paudel; Adhikari, Subash			First report on the bacterial community composition, diversity, and functions in Ramsar site of Central Himalayas, Nepal	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Wetland bacterial communities are highly sensitive to altered hydrology and the associated change in water physicochemical and biological properties leading to shifts in community composition and diversity, hence affecting the ecological roles. However, relevant studies are lacking in the wetlands of central Himalayas Nepal. Thus, we aimed to explore the variation of bacterial communities, diversity, and ecologic functions in the wet and dry periods of a wetland (designed as Ramsar site, Ramsar no 2257) by using 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq sequencing. We reported a pronounced variation in water physicochemical and biological properties (temperature, pH, Chla, DOC, and TN), bacterial diversity, and community composition. Bacterial communities in the dry season harbored significantly higher alpha diversity, while significantly higher richness and abundance were reflected in the wet season. Our results uncovered the effect of nutrients on bacterial abundance, richness, and community composition. Fourteen percent of the total OTUs were shared in two hydrological periods, and the largest portion of unique OTUs (58%) was observed in the dry season. Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes dominated the wet season exclusive OTUs; meanwhile, Actinobacteria dominated the dry season exclusive OTUs. Bacteria in these wetlands exhibited divergent ecological functions during the dry and wet seasons. By disclosing the variation of water bacterial communities in different hydrologic periods and their relationship with environmental factors, this first-hand work in the Ramsar site of Nepal will develop a baseline dataset for the scientific community that will assist in understanding the wetland's microbial ecology and biogeography.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2023	195	5							573	10.1007/s10661-023-11158-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11158-0								37060391					WOS:000983708800001

The Moenave Formation: Sedimentologic and stratigraphic context of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in the Four Corners area, southwestern USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Moenave Formation was deposited during latest Triassic to earliest Jurassic time in a mosaic of fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian subenvironments. Ephemeral streams that flowed north-northwest (relative to modem geographic position) deposited single and multi-storeyed trough cross-bedded sands on an open floodplain. Sheet flow deposited mainly silt across broad interchannel flats. Perennial lakes, in which mud, silt and carbonate were deposited, formed on the terminal floodplain; these deposits experienced episodic desiccation. Winds that blew dominantly east to south-southeast formed migrating dunes and sand sheets that were covered by low-amplitude ripples. The facies distribution varies greatly across the outcrop belt. The lacustrine facies of the terminal floodplain are limited to the northern part of the study area. In a southward direction along the outcrop belt (along the Echo Cliffs and Ward Terrace in Arizona), dominantly fluvial-lacustrine and subordinate eolian facies grade mainly to eolian dune and interdune facies. This transition records the encroachment of the Wingate erg. Moenave outcrops expose a north-south lithofacies gradient from distal, (erg margin) to proximal (erg interior). The presence of ephemeral stream and lake deposits, abundant burrowing and vegetative activity, and the general lack of strongly developed aridisols or evaporites suggest a climate that was seasonally and both before and during deposition of the Moenave and the laterally equivalent Wingate Sandstone. We interpret growth of the erg as a consequence of marine regression during the latest Triassic through earliest Jurassic that exposed sediments on the coast of the back-arc sea to eolian reworking. Tectonic processes that created accommodation space enhanced preservation of the erg.

J	Kaiser, TM				Kaiser, TM			The dietary regimes of two contemporaneous populations of Hippotherium primigenium (Perissodactyla, Equidae) from the Vallesian (Upper Miocene) of Southern Germany	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The first occurrence of tridactyl, hipparionine horses is presently constrained in Eurasia between 11.2 and 10.8 Myr. Hippotherium primigenium is the only species recorded up to now in the early Vallesian-early Turolian of Germany. Two Vallesian populations of H. primigenium are investigated with respect to their trophic regimes. One of these populations derives from the deposits of the Upper Miocene Rhine river exposed at the locality of Eppelsheim (Germany). The other population (Howenegg) is represented by lacustrine deposits of a former crater lake about 180 km south of Eppelsheim. Both localities represent two almost contemporaneous Vallesian (MN9) populations of a single equid taxon (H. primigenium) from different geographic regions within western Germany. Trophic regimes are reconstructed using the mesowear method [Fortelius and Solounias, Am. Mus. Novit. 3301 (2000) 1-36] and the derived 'extended' mesowear method [Kaiser and Solounias, Geodiversitas (2003), in press]. These analyses lead to the identification of a recent trophic reference taxon for each of the two hipparion populations. The common waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), a grazer inhabiting reed beds and also foraging into woodlands is identified as the trophic analog for the Eppelsheim population. The reference taxon of the Howenegg population is the Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), a browser, inhabiting mainly hilly country and preferring saplings, fruit, leaves, twigs, and bark as major food items. The marked differences in the trophic regimes found for the two populations of H. primigenium are interpreted as reflecting the range of possible dietary regimes, here termed the trophic spectrum of this equid species. The trophic signal of H. primigenium is therefore interpreted as an ecological signal reflecting properties of the habitat. The paleohabitat of Eppelsheim would then be recognized as representing at least seasonally extended grassy areas such as reed flats in the proximity of the Miocene Rhine river. The paleohabitat of the Howenegg, however, was most likely an immediate part of the subtropical mesophytic forests, that covered large parts of Central and Western Europe, Central Asia and southern China during the Vallesian period.

J	Leng, MJ; Anderson, NJ				Leng, MJ; Anderson, NJ			Isotopic variation in modern lake waters from western Greenland	HOLOCENE												The stable-isotope composition of lake waters along Sondre Stromfjord in western Greenland have been measured both spatially (coast to ice sheet) and temporally (up to five times between 1998-2000) and the data compared to local climatic information. There is a climatic gradient along Sondre Stromfjord, with the head of the fjord characterised by a low Arctic continental climate, while the coast has a more maritime climate (increased precipitation and reduced annual temperature range). The change in climate from continental to maritime is reflected in the isotopic composition of the lakes. The inland lakes have delta(18)O and deltaD values which lie on evaporation trends away from meteoric water composition. The coastal lakes have delta(18)O and dD compositions close to meteoric water. Short-term seasonal trends are superimposed on longer term variation. For example, the relatively dry years (precipitation lower than the long-term annual mean) of 1998 and 1999 are seen in the smaller lakes as isotopic enrichment, but the larger lakes are buffered in their response to short-term changes. The small coastal lakes tend to have depleted delta(13)C derived predominantly from organic material, while the inland lakes have contributions from both organic carbon and from exchange with isotopically heavier atmospheric CO2. This study demonstrates the importance of characterizing local hydrological settings in the interpretation of lacustrine isotope records. In the Arctic, this type of information is especially useful for identifying lakes that have the potential to record arid intervals since precipitation/evaporation adjustments, especially toward greater aridity, may not be recorded in the Greenland ice-core records.

Light availability for Chlorobium phaeobacteroides development in Lake Kinneret	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeobacteroides forms a dense population in the oxygen-devoid layers of Lake Kinneret, Israel, from July throughout November. The typical vertical distribution of the species is characterized by a prominent peak at the center of the metalimnion, but the light available at that depth in Lake Kinneret is far below the values that enable maximal photosynthetic activity of C. phaeobacteroides. In this paper, we report on our findings regarding the characteristics of C. phaeobacteroides development in Lake Kinneret, both in space and time. We further quantified the available light in the metalinmion and suggest a model for the development of C. phaeobacteroides in the lake. Spatial analysis of C. phaeobacteroides suggest that a combination of diurnal north-west wind, diurnal oscillations of the metalimnion and the hours of sunlight result in a situation in which the metalimnion in some parts of the lake is exposed to slightly higher light intensities than the other parts of the lake, and therefore allows higher concentrations of C. phaeobacteroides to develop. The analysis of C. phaeobacteroides with time suggests that it can be described fairly well by the logistic growth model.

J	Tibebe, D; Tesfaye, Y; Kassa, Y				Tibebe, Dessie; Tesfaye, Yemane; Kassa, Yezbie			The impact of sewage effluents on water quality of Lake Hawassa, Ethiopia	BMC CHEMISTRY												The physicochemical characteristics of water samples from Lake Hawassa was determined with the aim of pointing out possible impacts of industrial effluents, agricultural chemicals and domestic sewage on the water quality of the lake. For this, a total of 15 physicochemical parameters were measured in 72 water samples collected from four different locations on the lake that are adjacent to areas involved in various human activities including agriculture (Tikur Wuha), resort hotel (Haile Resort), public recreation (Gudumale) and referral hospital (Hitita). Samples were collected over a period of six months covering the dry and wet seasons in 2018/19. One-way analysis of variance revealed the presence of significant difference in the physicochemical quality of the lake's water across the four study areas and the two seasons. Principal component analysis identified the most discriminating characteristics that differentiate the studied areas according to the nature and level of pollution status. Tikur Wuha area was found to be characterized by high levels of EC and TDS, the values of these parameters were about twice or more than that measured in the other areas. This was ascribed to contamination of the lake by runoff water from the surrounding farmlands. On the other hand, the water around the other three areas was characterized by high nitrate, sulfate and phosphate. Hierarchical cluster analysis classified the sampling areas in to two groups, where Tikur Wuha constituted one group and the other three locations the second group. Linear discriminant analysis provided 100% correct classification of the samples into the two cluster groups. The measured values of turbidity, fluoride and nitrate were found to be significantly higher than the standard limits set by national and international guidelines. These results show that the lake has been facing serious pollution problems from various anthropogenic activities.

The Dewatering of the Fucino Lake Did Not Promote the M7.1 1915 Fucino Earthquake: Insights From Numerical Simulations	TECTONICS												The powerful M7.1 earthquake that devastated the Fucino Basin (Central Italy) in 1915 results to be the only (except for a M5.7 event in 1904) remarkable event to have occurred in that area, according to the 900-year-long record of the Italian Seismic Catalogue. Curiously, the 1915 event occurred only 38years after the complete man-induced dewatering of the largest lake of peninsular Italy, which formerly occupied the basin. Hence, we investigate on a possible relationship between the dewatering of the lake and the occurrence of the 1915 earthquake. We perform some numerical simulations in order to estimate the stress changes induced by the dewatering of the Fucino Lake and by the 1904 earthquake. We compute the stress changes on two different seismogenic sources selected among the ones proposed in the literature. Our main results support that (1) the dewatering process has reduced effects of the state of stress in the area before the 1915 earthquake, (2) the primary effect of the dewatering on both sources is a decrease of stresses that hampers the slip on the fault planes, and (3) the positive stress changes associated to the 1904 event would be too weak to influence the occurrence of the 1915 earthquake. We also suggest that the dewatering may have delayed by 1.7years the 1915 earthquake occurrence. Plain Language Summary The powerful M7.1 earthquake that devastated the Fucino Basin (Central Italy) in 1915 occurred only 38years after the complete man-induced dewatering of the largest lake of peninsular Italy, which formerly occupied the basin. Hence, we investigate on a possible relationship between the dewatering of the lake and the occurrence of the 1915 earthquake. We find that the stress changes originated by the Fucino Lake dewatering represent the main factor of perturbation in the area prior to 1915; however, such a dewatering process may have only slightly (a couple of years) delayed the occurrence of the strong rupture of the 1915 earthquake. Our work confirms the possibility that human activities can induce a temporal delay in the occurrence of future earthquakes.

The Degradation of O-ethyltoluene and 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene in Lake Naivasha Wetland, Kenya	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The primary degradation of benzene derivatives in aquatic environments occurs via microbial and chemical processes. This study investigated the kinetic degradation of o-ethyltoluene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene in the wetland of Lake Naivasha. Sediment samples were collected from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM at intervals of 3 h during the dry season of December 2017. The sediment samples were air dried, ground into powder, followed by soxhlet extraction in a binary mixture of methanol and hexane in the ratio of 1:1. The extract was analyzed using gas chromatograph with mass selective detector. Variation in the concentrations of o-ethyltoluene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene with time was monitored kinetically. Accordingly, the half-lives for the degradation of o-ethyltoluene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were 4.9 and 5.4 h, respectively, and their corresponding decay rate constants were 3.93 x 10(-5) and 3.56 x 10(-5) S-1. 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene was the most persistent contaminants in the wetland.

Estimation of CO2 Fluxes in the "Atmosphere-Water" System in the South Lake Baikal Littoral with the Floating Chamber Method	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												In this work, we discuss the applicability of the chamber method for measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes between the atmosphere and water in the littoral of Lake Baikal. Advantages and disadvantages of the method are considered. Previously submitted data are compared with observations in 2011-2014, when dramatically different weather situations occurred. It is shown that interannual variations in the total CO2 fluxes are much weaker than their seasonal variations. The annual flux of carbon dioxide from atmosphere to the water surface in the littoral of Lake Baikal is assessed to be at least 6.5-7 g/m(2) per year in an "open water" period.

In this paper, three subgenera of the genus Phoenicopsis from the Middle Jurassic, Yan'an Formation of the Ordos Basin, China, Phoenicopsis (subg. Phoenicopsis) (Heer) Samylina, P. (subg. Windwardia) (Florin) Samylina and P. (subg. Culgoweria) (Florin) Samylina are identified based upon the leaf epidermal features for the first time. This discovery demonstrates that Phoenicopsis was quite diverse during the Middle Jurassic in northern China. Its biodiversity is significant for further understanding Middle Jurassic paleophytogeography and paleoclimatology of northern China. The current findings show that the three Phoenicopsis subgenera coexisted and flourished in the mixed zone (ecotone) between the Indo-Sinian Floristic Region and the Siberian Floristic Region as seasonal deciduous plants (trees or shrubs) during the Middle Jurassic. They were important elements in the Middle Jurassic deciduous gymnospermous forest community in warm temperate regions with seasonal temperature and precipitation variations. They are interpreted as growing on the hillsides and sloping fields along meandering streams, lakes and swamps in a vast sedimentary basin in a wet and warm environment.

Peculiarities of Phenology of the Primary Production Process in the Pelagic Zone of Lake Onega	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The peculiarities of the phenology of the primary production process of phytoplankton have been studied for a large northern lake. The major seasonal events of the primary production process and the seasonal dynamics of the abiotic and biotic environmental factors have been described using the average multi-year curves of the studied parameters in the pelagic zone of Lake Onega. The primary production seasonal cycle is synchronized to the water temperature dynamics, chlorophyll a concentration (phytoplankton), and the density of "nondiatom" phytoplankton. The seasonal dynamics of the diatoms exhibits the opposite pattern. The temperature coefficient of photosynthesis (Q(10)) has been calculated for the natural phytoplankton community for the different seasons of vegetation period. The phenological phases of the primary production have been defined.

This study examined the spatial and seasonal dynamics of organic carbon in size-fractioned sediments to identify the role of physical protection (e.g. burial, aggregation) for preserving carbon and the potential impact of a dam on the mineralization of sedimentary organic carbon in the dammed Lancang-Mekong River. Sediment samples were collected from the Manwan Reservoir, China, in the rainy and dry seasons using a gravitational bottom sampler. One sample was collected from the centre of the river and two samples were collected on the river edges, 5 m away from each bank. Sediments were divided into three size classes of water-stable aggregates by wet sieving, including macroaggregates, microaggregates and silts. The total organic carbon (TOC), labile organic carbon (LOC), total nitrogen (TN) and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) were measured to analyse the dynamic features of organic carbon in the sediments. The preservation of organic carbon in the sediments collected from the main stream decreased with an increase in distance from the Manwan dam, while it remained consistently high in the tributaries. The majority of the sediments collected during the rainy season preserved more TOC and TN than the samples collected during the dry season. Because of the increase in the proportion of sands in macroaggregates and microaggregates, the TOC contents decreased. In contrast, silts and clays were not affected and performed well in protecting organic carbon. The sediments in the lacustrine area and forepart of the transition area, with lower delta C-13 and higher C/N values, suggested a mixture of aquatic and agro-ecosystem inputs and led to high proportions of LOC in TOC. Dam construction reinforced the carbon sink and role of physical protection in the Manwan reservoir by enhancing fine fraction deposition and organic carbon inputs, especially during the rainy season. The sediments dominated by silts and clays absorbed and preserved more organic carbon than the samples dominated by sands. The majority of the organic carbon buried in the lacustrine area, the forepart of the transition area and the tributaries was protected by microaggregates, silts and clays. With the development of fisheries and agriculture, increasing amounts of labile organic carbon buried in sediments may lead to an increase in the potential for carbon mineralization.

J	Villar-Argaiz, M; Medina-Sánchez, JM; Carrillo, P				Villar-Argaiz, M; Medina-Sánchez, JM; Carrillo, P			Linking life history strategies and ontogeny in crustacean zooplankton: Implications for homeostasis	ECOLOGY												Work to date has established that consumers are constrained in their chemical content variability. Such a constraint generates many different kinds of ecological relationships ranging from aspects of animal mineral nutrition to factors affecting consumer-driven nutrient recycling. Although previous studies have shown variation in zooplankton nutrient content within and between taxa, most stoichiometric studies assume that consumers are homeostatic in their elemental composition. In this paper, this assumption is reexamined as we describe the variability in the elemental content of the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus Lilljeborg throughout its ontogeny (interstage variability) and for its specific developmental stages (intrastage variability). Mean copepod carbon content as dry mass increased significantly during ontogeny from 36.3% in nauplii to 51.5% in immature copepodites and 55.8% in adults. Mean phosphorus content decreased from 0.98% in nauplii to 0.87% in immature copepodites and 0.51% in adults. The copepod molar C:N:P ratio was 99:3:1 for nauplii, 165:13:1 for immature copepodites, and 234:25:1 for adults. These ontogenetic variations in stoichiometry within a single copepod species are comparable to the previously described range between taxa. Stoichiometric and physiological approaches are used as complementary tools to explain the two-part life history strategy of this copepod. First, the nauplii and early copepodite stages (CI-CIV) with high carbon demands adopt a growth strategy during which carbon sources are mainly allocated to increases in body size. The susceptibility of these copepodite stages to carbon limitation is reflected in the decline in the carbon content for a given stage (e.g., from 66% to 38% C in CII) and in the 40-fold decrease in neutral-to-polar lipid ratio toward the end of the ice-free season, suggesting a mobilization of food reserves toward growth. In contrast, copepodite stage C V and adults with less carbon demands for growth followed a survival-reproductive strategy, where the invariability in carbon content as dry mass (near 60%) and in neutral-to-polar lipid ratio through time indicates no accumulation of storage lipids, but instead an allocation of resources toward maintenance or reproduction. The basic assumption of predictions of stoichiometric models that elemental composition remains constant with time are not supported by changes in the intrastage carbon and nitrogen contents of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus. Thus, we suggest that the idea of strict homeostasis may be replaced with the concept of rheostasis, which allows the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms of an organism to adjust to a changing environment over time.

Climate and land use changes raise new concerns about the sustainability of these habitat networks, as water scarcity triggers ecological and socioeconomic impacts threatening wetland availability and quality. During the migration period, birds can be present in large enough numbers to influence water quality themselves linking them and water management in efforts to conserve habitats for endangered populations. Despite this, the guidelines within laws do not properly account for the annual change of water quality due to natural factors such as the migration periods of birds. Principal component analysis and principal component regression was used to analyze the correlations between the presence of a multitude of migratory waterbird communities and water quality metrics based on a dataset collected over four years in the Dumbravia section of the Homorod stream in Transylvania. The results reveal a correlation between the presence and numbers of various bird species and the seasonal changes in water quality. Piscivorous birds tended to increase the phosphorus load, herbivorous waterbirds the nitrogen load, while benthivorous duck species influenced a variety of parameters. The established PCR water quality prediction model showed accurate prediction capabilities for the water quality index of the observed region. For the tested data set, the method provided an R-2 value of 0.81 and a mean squared prediction error of 0.17.

AQUATIC BOTANY												Promoting indigenous submerged macrophytes is considered an important measure to restore shallow lakes. On the other hand, dense stands of aquatic vegetation often cause nuisance for boating, swimming and by obstruction of water flow. Consequently, the interests of recreational users may conflict with nature conservation. At first sight, aiming lake management at intermediate vegetation biomass seems a good solution for this controversy. However, as can be shown with a simple economical model, such a compromise may not always be an optimal solution in terms of total welfare across all users of a lake. Here, we show that a management strategy aimed at moderate plant biomass can also be unfeasible for ecological reasons. This is shown by applying two very different models: a minimal logistic model of plant growth which is easy to understand, and the relatively complex and realistic simulation model Charisma which, among other things, includes the seasonal cycle and a detailed description of the dynamics of light availability for macrophytes. The qualitative results of both models were remarkably similar. If the ecosystem has no alternative stable states, it is possible to set vegetation to any desired sustainable level using an appropriate harvesting strategy. However, if an intermediate vegetation biomass is to be realized the costs of harvesting are high, because the yield is predicted to be maximal in that case, If the ecosystem has alternative stable states, harvesting becomes risky because the vegetation may collapse entirely below a certain, in practice unknown, biomass. Also, even moderate harvesting may reduce the resilience of the vegetated state, making the ecosystem more vulnerable to adverse conditions such as unfavorable weather conditions or bird grazing.

In this study, the possibility of using Seyhan River, which bisects Adana and Seyhan dam lake, as heat source-sink is investigated. The temperature of Seyhan River was monitored throughout the year and the data were compared with those of the ambient air. Analysis of the results of the experimental study carried out using a heat pump system that was capable of utilizing both air and water as heat source-sink revealed that the use of Seyhan River instead of ambient air could be advantageous during the whole heating and cooling seasons.

However, little is known about arsenic speciation in this environment, particularly regarding speciation changes related to lake trophic status and seasonal variations. To fill this gap, arsenic speciation analysis was carried out in surface (SW) and subsurface (SSW) waters sampled in five soda lakes with different eutrophication status, in two dry and one wet season. As (V) was the dominant species in these waters, while As(III), DMA, MMA and likely complex organic species were present in lower amounts. The results allow to conclude that the arsenic speciation in SW and SSW varies seasonally according to the regional wet or dry periods and lake water levels. In eutrophic turbid and in oligotrophic vegetated soda lakes, arsenic speciation was also characterized by spatial differences between edge and center or between the SW and SSW. Cyanobacteria or macrophytes/algae are involved in arsenic biotransformation in soda lakes through its metabolic and detoxification processes. Significant variation in surface water arsenic speciation occurs as a result of seasonal primary production fluctuation or water arsenic concentration changes in the soda lakes, increasing organoarsenics in dry periods, whereas in flood periods, As (V) prevails. Spatial distribution of arsenic species is significantly impacted by biogeochemical conditions at the water/sediment interface in soda lakes.

Tectonically induced climate and its control on the distribution of depositional systems in a continental foreland basin, Cloverly and Lakota Formations (Lower Cretaceous) of Wyoming, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Continental sediments of the Cleverly and Lakota Fort nations (Lower Cretaceous) in Wyoming are subdivided into three depositional systems: perennial to intermittent alluvial, intermittent to ephemeral alluvial, and playa. Chert-bearing sandstones, conglomerates, carbonaceous mudrocks, blocky mudrocks, and skeletal limestones were deposited by perennial to intermittent alluvial systems. Carbonaceous mudrocks contain abundant wood fragments, cuticle and cortical debris, and other vascular plant remains representing deposition in oxbow lakes, abandoned channels, and on floodplains under humid to seasonal conditions. Intrafotmational conglomerates, sandstones, bioturbated and blocky mudrocks with caliche nodules, and bioturbated limestones characterize deposition in intermittent to ephemeral alluvial systems. Bioturbated limestones are encased in bioturbated mudrocks with abundant pseudo-slickensides. The presence of caliche nodules in some of the blocky to bioturbated mudrocks is consistent with supersaturation and precipitation of calcium carbonate from groundwater under semi-arid conditions. Caliche nodules, pseudo-slickensides, and carbonate-rich floodplain sediments are interpreted to have been deposited by intermittent to ephemeral alluvial systems under seasonal to semi-arid climatic conditions. Laminated mudrocks, siltstones, vuggy carbonates, bedded to nodular evaporites, pebbly mudrocks, and diamictites were deposited in evaporative alkaline lakes or playas. Pebbly mudrocks and diamictites are interpreted to represent deposition from channelized and unchannelized hyperconcentrated flows on a playa, resulting from intense rain events within the basin. The areal abundance and distribution of these depositional systems change systematically across the overfilled portion of the Early Cretaceous Cordilleran foreland basin in Wyoming. The lower part (A-interval) of the Cloverly and Lakota Formations is characterized by deposits of perennial to intermittent rivers that existed 300 to 1000 kin east of the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt. Proximal to the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt, the A-interval of the Cloverly Formation and upper Ephraim Formation of the Gannett Group are typified by deposits of intermittent to ephemeral rivers and their associated floodplains. In the middle part (B-interval) of the Cleverly Formation, intermittent to ephemeral alluvial systems expand to 600 km into the basin. The upper part (C-interval) of the Cloverly Formation is characterized by playa deposits in the Bighorn and Wind River Basins and intermittent to ephemeral alluvial deposits along the front of the ancestral Sevier Mountains. Deposits of perennial to intermittent alluvial systems in the C-interval of the Cloverly and Lakota Formations are restricted to the Black Hills region, almost 900 km to the east of the Sevier Mountains. The change in the areal distribution of depositional systems through time within this continental foreland basin may be attributed to the development of a rain shadow associated with the uplift of the Sevier Mountains in the Early Cretaceous.

Habitat and diet differentiation by two strains of rainbow trout in Lake Superior based on archival tags, stable isotopes, and bioenergetics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Three analytical tools including archival tags, stable isotope analysis, and bioenergetics modeling were applied to two strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Minnesota waters of Lake Superior to determine habitat and trophic position. Between 2006 and 2009, archival tags that recorded time, temperature, and pressure were surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavities of 34 steelhead ("STT") and 93 Kamloops ("KAM") which were released into Lake Superior. After the initial spawning season, 10 SIT and 9 KAM tags were recovered, with up to two years of recorded data. Both strains were surface-oriented, spending more than half of their time as adults in the top 1 m of water, and 80% of their time in the top 2 m. Diel vertical movements were noted more often in SIT, likely reflecting higher consumption of Mysis diluviana, while the frequencies of other vertical movement patterns were similar between the two strains. Mean temperatures recorded by tags were used in bioenergetics simulations to estimate consumption of prey species. Temperatures recorded by archival tags were warmer than the water temperatures used in earlier bioenergetics simulations in Minnesota waters, and estimated consumption of prey fish by SIT and KAM populations at the warmer temperatures was about 23% greater. Stable isotope analyses reflected higher consumption of small fish by both predator strains than identified in prior diet summaries based on stomach contents. Based on these analyses, habitats occupied by both strains are similar, and their impact on prey fish populations in nearshore waters is greater than previously estimated.

For the development of sustained land use, management knowledge of plant performance in relation to resource supply is needed. We estimated productivity related functional traits at the edges of the habitat of Populus euphratica Oliv. Specific leaf area (SLA) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio of P. euphratica leaves growing near a former river bank and close to moving sand dunes in the Ebinur Lake National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang, Northwest China (near Kazakhstan) were determined and daily courses of CO2 net assimilation (P (N)), transpiration (E), and stomatal conductance (g(s)) of two consecutive seasons were measured during July-August 2007 and June-July 2008. Groundwater level was high (1.5-2.5 m below ground) throughout the years and no flooding occurred at the two tree stands. SLA was slightly lower near the desert than at the former river bank and leaves contained less N in relation to C. Highest E and g(s) of P. euphratica were reached in the morning before noon on both stands and a second low maximum occurred in the afternoon despite of the unchanged high levels of air to leaf water vapor pressure deficit (ALVPD). Decline of g(s) in P. euphratica was followed by decrease of E. Water use efficiency (WUE) of leaves near the desert were higher in the morning and the evening, in contrast to leaves from the former river bank that maintained an almost stable level throughout the day. High light compensation points and high light saturation levels of P (N) indicated the characteristics of leaves well-adapted to intensive irradiation at both stands. In general, leaves of P. euphratica decreased their g(s) beyond 20 Pa/kPa ALVPD in order to limit water losses. Decrease of E did not occur in both stands until 40 Pa/kPa ALVPD was reached. Full stomatal closure of P. euphratica was achieved at 60 Pa/kPa ALVPD in both stands. E through the leaf surface amounted up to 30% of the highest E rates, indicating dependence on water recharge from the ground despite of obviously closed stomata. A distinct leaf surface temperature (T-leaf) threshold of around 30A degrees C also existed before stomata started to close. Generally, the differences in gas exchange between both stands were small, which led to the conclusion that micro-climatic constraints to E and photosynthesis were not the major factors for declining tree density with increasing distance from the river.

Length Frequency Age Estimations of American Eel Recruiting to the Upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We applied length frequency analysis (LFA) with multiple model inference to estimate the age structure of American Eel Anguilla rostrata recruiting to the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario system between 1975 and 2008. The LFA results were used to derive a composite relative abundance index for 48 cohorts from 1967 to 2004. The size of eel recruits was influenced by both year and season and consistently increased from July to October. Age composition and mean length at age varied greatly from year to year. On average, eels spent about 6years in the lower St. Lawrence River before they recruited to Lake Ontario. A nonsymmetric distribution function, such as lognormal or Gamma function, was selected to describe length-at-age observations of American Eels. Recruiting cohorts appeared to be relatively strong from the late 1960s to the late 1970s but subsequently declined exponentially. Some recovery signs were found for the last 8years, but cohorts have been weak since 1988. A validation study showed that the LFA with multiple model inference approach can successfully estimate the age structure from length frequency observations. Our results provide scientific support for underlying eel habitat restoration and protection efforts in Lake Ontario and the upper St Lawrence River.

J	Holmes, JA				Holmes, Jonathan A.			Sample-size implications of the trace-element variability of ostracod shells	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The magnesium and strontium contents of fossil ostracod-shell calcite have been used extensively in the reconstruction of water composition and temperature in lakes and, to a lesser degree, in marginal-marine waters and in the deep ocean. Current instrumentation may allow single shells of these calcite microfossils to be analysed and most studies have taken advantage of this capability. However, there is now good evidence for large intra-sample variability in the trace-element content of ostracod shells, both in living populations and in fossil assemblages, and this has implications for any attempt to distinguish the low-frequency (similar to decadal or longer) trends in water temperature and composition that are often the goals of palaeoenvironmental studies, from higher-frequency (seasonal or interannual) 'noise'. In this study, the Mg and Sr contents of living and fossil populations of six species of marine, marginal-marine and shallow-marine ostracods from 11 sites are used to investigate sources of variability and to estimate critical sample sizes for stratigraphic studies. Results confirm that variability amongst individual samples is generally wide and cannot be attributed to instrumental error or sample handling alone. In some instances, variability can be explained by fluctuations in water composition and/or temperature, although this has to be evaluated in each case. Some evidence points to non-environmental control on variability in shell composition, perhaps connected to genetically-controlled differences in physiology that affected calcification, early diagenetic alteration, or the role of environmental factors other than temperature or water composition. However, further work is needed to verify this. In some stratigraphic studies, large numbers (> 20) of individual shells would need to be analysed in order to detect low-frequency environmental changes with any degree of confidence, although fewer shells may often suffice. The critical sample size depends on the variability at each study site, which should ideally be evaluated using pilot studies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental quality of the La Polvora urban lagoon in the Grijalva river watershed. Water Technology and Sciences (in Spanish). Vol. III, No. 3, July-September, 2012, pp. 143-152. Water quality and the diversity of epibenthic macrofauna and fish was analyzed in La Polvora urban lagoon during low water season. The potential of hydrogen, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrates and total phosphorus met current Mexican norms for secondary contact recreational use. Nevertheless, values for fecal coliforms exceeded the norms and represented a health risk, although the water quality was classified as good according to the Water Quality Index. The doubling of total phosphorus recorded 15 years earlier in La Polvora lagoon helps to explain the current hyper-eutrophic state. The diversity of epibenthic macrofauna and fish was lower than other limnetic ecosystems in the region due to the small number of species of mollusks and fish collected as well as the absence of aquatic insects and macrocrustaceans and fish belonging to the Poecillidae family. This lagoon is shown to be undergoing environmental degradation, as indicated by its hyper-eutrophic state, high values for fecal coliforms, low values for diversity of epibenthic macrofauna and fish, the percentage of exotic species and low values for the conditional factor of 11 fish species. These findings suggest the need to review the management program and its operations in this ecosystem.

In this study, the effect of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) on the tissues of freshwater pearl mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii) was evaluated and differentially expressed genes in the hepatopancreas of the mussel exposed to MC-LR were identified. HPLC analysis of cell extracts from various tissues of the mussel indicated that the hepatopancreas had the highest MC-LR levels (55.78 +/- 6.73 mu g g-1 DW) after15-day exposure. The MC-LR concentration in gill or muscle was an order of magnitude less than in hepatopancreas or gonad. Subtractive cDNA library was constructed by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), and similar to 400 positive clones were sequenced, from which 98 high quality sequences were obtained by BLAST analysis. The screening identified numerous genes involved in apoptosis, signal transduction, cytoskeletal remodel, innate immunity, material and energy metabolism, translation and transcription which were extensively discussed. The results of this study add large amount of information to the mussel genome data, and for the first time present the basic data on toxicity effect of MC-LR on mussel.

Altering an extended phenotype reduces intraspecific male aggression and can maintain diversity in cichlid fish	PEERJ												Reduced male aggression towards different phenotypes generating negative frequency-dependent intrasexual selection has been suggested as a mechanism to facilitate the invasion and maintenance of novel phenotypes in a population. To date, the best empirical evidence for the phenomenon has been provided by laboratory studies on cichlid fish with different colour polymorphisms. Here we experimentally tested the hypothesis in a natural population of Lake Malawi cichlid fish, in which males build sand-castles (bowers) to attract females during seasonal leks. We predicted that if bower shape plays an important role in male aggressive interactions, aggression among conspecific males should decrease when their bower shape is altered. Accordingly, we allocated randomly chosen bowers in a Nyassachromis cf. microcephalus lek into three treatments: control, manipulated to a different shape, and simulated manipulation. We then measured male behaviours and bower shape before and after these treatments. We found that once bower shape was altered, males were involved in significantly fewer aggressive interactions with conspecific males than before manipulation. Mating success was not affected. Our results support the idea that an extended phenotype, such as bower shape, can be important in maintaining polymorphic populations. Specifically, reduced male conspecific aggression towards males with different extended phenotypes (here, bower shapes) may cause negative frequency-dependent selection, allowing the invasion and establishment of a new phenotype (bower builder). This could help our understanding of mechanisms of diversification within populations, and in particular, the overall diversification of bower shapes within Lake Malawi cichlids.																			2167-8359					NOV 26	2013	1								e209	10.7717/peerj.209	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.209								24349896					WOS:000209191600001

Birds as major predators of fishes in the East Kleinemonde Estuary	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												This study provides a quantitative account of fish predation by piscivorous birds in the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary and represents the first global attempt to simultaneously relate such consumption to production by a fish community in the same estuary. Cormorants and herons were the dominant predators and seasonal variations in the avifaunal community composition were noted. Based on comprehensive counts over three years, the piscivorous bird population was estimated to have consumed a maximum of 4 414 kg of fish in 1994, 2 400 kg in 1995/96 and 2 960 kg in 2004/05. In 1995/96 fish production in the East Kleinemonde Estuary (55.89 g m(-2) a(-1)) was estimated at 9 780 kg and maximum bird predation amounted to 25% of annual fish production within the system over the same period, assuming that all birds counted on the estuary foraged there and that the diet of these birds comprised only fish. The above 1995/96 figures, together with an estimate of fish predation by the dominant piscivorous fish Lichia amia of 696 kg suggests that birds are probably the single most important natural predator of fishes within this estuary. An unusual mass invasion by marine Cape Cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis during July 1994 was responsible for large-scale predation of fish (2 155 kg) and resulted in the population of estuary-associated marine fishes declining from approximately 63 300 to about 18 600 individuals during the 1994 closed phase. Given that little or no marine fish recruitment was possible while the estuary mouth was closed, piscivorous birds are likely to have a higher predatory impact on populations of juvenile marine fishes in small temporarily closed estuaries than in larger permanently open systems.

Priority Phthalates in the Lake Baikal Pelagic Zone and Coastal Area	CHEMISTRY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												The contents of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were assessed in the Lake Baikal pelagic zone. The spatial heterogeneity of the distribution of phthalates in the upper and deep water levels for all basins of Lake Baikal was determined from 0.06 to 3.1 mu g/dm(3) of DBP and from 0.03 to 1.4 mu g/dm(3) of DEHP, seasonal variability of the total concentrations of phthalates in the pelagic zone of the lake being up to 10 times. Background stations of the reference section in three lake basins were proposed as reference areas for monitoring, and the average concentrations of phthalates in the upper aqueous layer (5-200 m) were proposed to assess the present content of phthalates in the water of the lake. The contents of DBP and DEHP in Lake Baikal Water over the period 2015-2016 were 0.35-0.89 and 0.06-0.32 mu g/dm(3), respectively, and do not exceed the MPC for water bodies specified in Russia. A simultaneous change in DBP concentration in the upper water layer of the pelagic zone of the southern lake basin and in its coastal area as pollution indicator was noted. Phthalates were determined by liquid-liquid extraction of analytes into n-hexane, direct analysis of extracts using chromatography-mass spectrometry in selective detection mode (m/z 149 and 153) and measurements by the internal standard method using di-n-octylphthalate-3,4,5,6-d(4) as a surrogate standard. Secondary pollution of water and extracts with laboratory phthalates was regarded as the systematic error that was assessed by the value of reagent blanks and subtracted from analysis results. The total error was assessed using the values of 25 and 20 % for DBP and DEHP, respectively.

It corresponds to a fragment of the dorsal carapace with articulated movable and fixed osteoderms, which comes from the proximity of the stream La Quenquiada, about 7 kin southeast of Amaicha del Valle, Tafi del Valle department, Tucuman province, Argentina. The specimen is assigned to Chasicotatus ameghinoi by the external morphology of the movable and fixed osteoderms. The bearing levels of the San Jose Formation are correlated with the middle and upper levels of the Arroyo Chasico Formation, in Buenos Aires Province, and Los Banos Member (lower member) of Chiquimil Formation in the Hualfin-Belen valley, in Catamarca Province.

Temporal dynamics and relationship between climate, limnological variables and zooplankton composition in climate-sensitive Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The community composition and the factors affecting seasonal and interannual dynamics of zooplankton in Lake Bosumtwi were studied biweekly at a central index station during 2005 and 2006. The lake zooplankton community was species poor. Mesocyclops bosumtwii was numerically superior seasonally and interannually and was endemic to the lake. Minor constituents included Moina micrura, six rotifer species (except for Hexarthra intermedia) and Chaoborus ceratopogones larvae. Low variance of cyanobacteria-dominated phytoplankton biomass underlined stable zooplankton community structure. Emergence of rare species of rotifers occurred seasonally. The climatic signature on the lake's stratification and mixing regime was strongly influenced by atmospheric temperature, but weakly by wind strength, because of sheltering of the lake by high crater walls. Increasing mixing depth entrained high TP concentrations from below the thermocline seasonally, but reflected poorly in the phytoplankton biomass behaviour. Total zooplankton abundance did not differ seasonally, but varied markedly from year to year in its timing and magnitude. Herbivores were squeezed between food limitation and high predation pressure from Chaoborus all year round. The low fish planktivory (high fishing pressure) on Chaoborus may create a trophic bottleneck restricting energy transfer efficiency from zooplankton to fish.

In total, more than 14,000 chironomid larvae were identified, belonging to 27 taxa. The results have pointed out the presence of 3 main chironomid assemblages in the lake: i) littoral community, which is mainly controlled by temperature and oxygen seasonal changes, ii) Chara-dominant community, which is mainly controlled by the presence and abundance of Characeae in the lake, and iii) profundal community, which is affected by low oxygen levels caused by sediment and organic matter discharge to the lake due to human pressures in the lake basin. We provide valuable insights for the managers to understand the current ecological status of Enol Lake and to evaluate which measures should be implemented to preserve or improve it. Moreover, our results constitute an essential step forward to improve the interpretation of the past changes of the lake by means of the subfossil chironomid community.

Dynamic Responses of Phosphorus Metabolism to Acute and Chronic Dietary Phosphorus-Limitation in Daphnia	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Food quality is highly dynamic within lake ecosystems and varies spatially and temporally over the growing season. Consumers may need to continuously adjust their metabolism in response to this variation in dietary nutrient content. However, the rates of metabolic responses to changes in food nutrient content has received little direct study. Here, we examine responses in two metabolic phosphorus (P) pools, ribonucleic acids (RNA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), along with body mass and body P content in Daphnia magna exposed to chronic and acute dietary P-limitation. First, we examined food quality effects on animals consuming different food carbon (C):P quality over a 14 day period. Then, we raised daphnids on one food quality for 4 days, switched them to contrasting dietary treatments, and measured changes in their metabolic responses at shorter time-scales (over 48 h). Animal P. RNA, and ATP content all changed through ontogeny with adults containing relatively less of these pools with increasing body mass. Irrespective of age, Daphnia consuming high C:P diets had lower body %P, %RNA, %ATP, and mass compared to animals eating low C:P diets. Diet switching experiments revealed diet dependent changes in body %P, %RNA, %ATP and animal mass within 48 h. We found that Daphnia switched from low to high C:P diets had some metabolic buffering capacity with decreases in body %P occurring after 24 h but mass remaining similar to initial diet conditions for 36 h after the diet switch. Switching Daphnia from low to high C:P diets caused a decrease in the RNA:P ratio after 48 h. Daphnia switched from high to low C:P diets increased their body P, RNA, and ATP content within 8-24 h. This switch from high to low C:P diets also led to increased RNA:P ratios in animal bodies. Overall, our study revealed that consumer P metabolism reflects both current and past diet due to more dynamic and rapid changes in P biochemistry than total body mass. This metabolic flexibility is likely linked to resource integration in D. magna, which reduces the negative effects of short-term or variable exposure to nutrient-deficient foods.					; Prater, Clay/I-5674-2019; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021; Wagner, Nicole/HNQ-6584-2023	Prater, Clay/0000-0002-9864-6242; Wagner, Nicole/0000-0001-9227-5674; 														2296-665X					2017	5								36	10.3389/fenvs.2017.00036	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2017.00036													WOS:000458352900034

Therefore, in this paper, eleven typical lakes in Central Asia were observed. The lake edges were obtained through image interpretation using the quasi-synchronous MODIS image, and then water level information with long period (2002-2015) was acquired using ENVISAT/RA-2 and Cryosat-2 satellite borne radar altimeter data. The results show that these 11 lakes all have obvious seasonal changes of water level in a year with a high peak at different month. During 2002 - 2015, their water levels present decreased trend generally except Sarygamysh Lake, Alakol Lake and North Aral Sea. The alpine lakes are most stables, while open lakes' levels change the most violently and closed lakes change diversely among different lakes.					; Liao, Jiajun/AAL-3864-2021	liao, jing juan/0000-0002-5915-2661; 													1755-1307						2017	74								012004	10.1088/1755-1315/74/1/012004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/74/1/012004													WOS:000439409200004

Fitness of the pestiferous small rodent Mastomys natalensis in an agroecosystem in Mayuge district, Lake Victoria Crescent, Uganda	MAMMALIA												A 2.5-year study was conducted to understand the fitness of Mastomys natalensis in an agroecosystem in relationship with environmental predictors. The study was conducted in Mayuge district, in the Lake Victoria Crescent zone in Eastern Uganda. Fitness was measured in terms of survival, maturation and capture probability and estimated using multi-event capture-recapture models. Survival rates were higher after high rainfall in the previous month and increased with increasing population density of the animals. Maturation rate, on the other hand, showed no significant association with any predictor variables, while capture probability was significantly associated with sex of the animals, with higher capture probability for males. The results demonstrate that the fitness of M. natalensis in an agroecosystem is dependent on rainfall, sex and current population density. The aforementioned results were associated with increasing vegetation which provides cover for animal nesting and abundant food for the animals during rainfall periods and thus increased survival, high mobility in males in search for mates thus exposing animals to high chances of being captured and increased prey saturation at high population density resulting in high animal survival. These results have important implications for the timing of management strategies, i.e. control efforts should be enforced during the rainfall seasons to prevent high population buildup in the succeeding seasons.

Experimental assessment and implications of long-term within-trap mineralization of seston in lake trapping studies	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Sediment trapping is a widely accepted technique in lake studies for analyzing seasonal limnological events and can provide insight into ecological succession as well as the seasonal dynamics of organic and inorganic fluxes. More recently, organic flux measurement from traps has been especially important in estimating whole-lake C sequestration as a basis for regional and global upscaling of C budgets across lake types. However, in-trap mineralization or dissolution of components of collected sediment (seston) has not been systematically examined, and thus a reliable correction factor for in-trap losses of various sedimentary fluxes (especially those involving organic carbon) is still unknown. This experimental study assesses the loss of algal biomass representative of a 6-month carousel-type (closed) sediment trap deployment in a deep, eutrophic lake under cold (similar to 5 degrees C) and anoxic ambient conditions typical of the hypolimnion in stratifying, temperate lakes. Results show a loss of organic matter (OM) at a consistent rate over 180 d, reducing the fraction of initial OM content by approximately a third after 180 d of deployment (linear regression of OM fraction loss = -0.001864t). The significance of these findings is demonstrated by application to published trap data; at Rostherne Mere, UK, which implies that annual OM fluxes are underestimated by 18.2% on average (range 13.7-23.2%). This highlights the far-reaching implications for lake sediment trap methodology and our understanding of seston taphonomy, suggesting a mineralization correction factor for OM should be applied to traps deployed for longer than 1 week. With loss correction factored in, this study supports the reliability of longer-term (i.e., similar to 6 months) sediment trap deployment.

FJORDIC LAGOONS OF THE BARENTS SEA AS MODELS FOR THE STUDY OF THE DYNAMICS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES WITH THE INTRODUCED RED KING CRAB, PARALITHODES CAMTSCHATICUS (DECAPODA, LITHODIDAE)	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												Benthic communities of the partially isolated deep fjordic lagoons Linjalampi and Sisajarvi in the inner part of Ambarnaya Bay, Varanger-fjord, Barents Sea, are influenced by the limited water exchange and surge in combination with other abiotic and biotic factors. Among the latter, the presence of numerous red king crabs (Paralithodes camtschaticus), naturalized in the southern part of the Barents Sea since the second half of the 20th century, can play particularly important roles. The median abundance of juvenile and adult crabs in the lagoons (42.5-52 specimens/1000 m(2) in most years of observation) is comparable to their abundance in the neighboring open parts of the Varanger-fjord. A narrow and shallow strait that connects these lagoons to the sea can possibly pose restrictions to crab migrations between these habitats. Thus, adult crabs are present in the lagoons also in those seasons when they migrate offshore in other coastal areas. Food chains directed from phytoplankton and macrophytes to benthic predators, such as king crabs, spider crabs (Hyas araneus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus pubescens), have been studied using the stable isotopes technique. The food chain "kelp - sea urchins - king crabs" is characteristic of the coastal zone of the Barents Sea, but this has not been revealed in the lagoons. The trophic level of adult king crabs in the lagoons (2.88) is lower than that both of spider crabs (3.16-3.42) and those king crabs that occur outside the lagoons (3.44). This indicates differences in the diet of king crabs inside and outside the lagoons. The low abundance and restricted distribution of sea urchins at Linjalampi and Sisajarvi may be the result of long-term crab predation. The Linjalampi and Sisajarvi lagoons are similar in several respects to continental lakes. In particular, the conditions in the lagoons make them convenient models for studies on long-term ecosystem dynamics.

Seasonal scale modeling of river inflows in stratified reservoirs: Structural vs. parametric uncertainty in inflow mixing	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												The extent to which vertical transport in reservoirs is accurately represented by one-dimensional (1D) lake models is linked to the quality of the algorithms representing the fate of inflows. Recent findings suggest that gravity currents in stratified environments not only entrain ambient water but they also detrain water as they flow down-slope. Here, we analyze whether the differences between the entrainment and the entrainment detrainment approaches of river inflow mixing implemented in 1D models could affect the seasonal-scale simulations of vertical transport in a reservoir. We demonstrate that the structural uncertainty associated with using different inflow modeling paradigms is statistically significant in terms of temperature and salinity predictions, as well as phosphorous loads available to the lake surface; and is of similar order of magnitude as the parametric uncertainty errors arising from the unknown value of model parameters and forcing.

The aim of this research is to evaluate methane dynamics through diurnal variation in the concentration of this gas in the water column of two lakes differing in trophic status at the campus of Fundacao Universidade do Rio Grande (FURG). In two sampling periods (November 2001 and July 2002) methane concentrations in the water column were significantly higher (3.66 and 0.41 mu moles.L-1, respectively) at Lago dos Biguas, with mesoeutrophic features when related to Lago Polegar (1.43 and 0.19 mu moles.L-1, respectively) which has oligotrophic features.

The total N (N-t), NH4+-N, and NO3--N concentrations in the lateral seepage water increased with increasing N rates. The seasonal N-t fluxes by lateral seepage varied from 6.8 to 25.6 kg N ha(-1) for urea application rates of 90 to 360 kg N ha(-1). Lateral seepage accounted for 4.7 to 6.6% of the N-t applied, implying that lateral seepage was an important pathway of N loss from near-trench paddy fields. The cumulative N loss via lateral seepage was significantly related to N fertilization rate (P = 0.05). Floodwater level was also identified as a main fator affecting N losses via lateral seepage from paddy fields, as indicated by a positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.43) between floodwater level and daily lateral flow during the flooded period (P = 0.05). Under the conditions of these experiments, a shallow floodwater depth of 50 mm, urea application rates of 90 kg N ha(-1) or less, and no rainfall within 1 wk after N application reduced N losses by lateral seepage from paddy fields.					li, hua/JYV-5056-2024; He, miaomiao/MYR-8706-2025														0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2008	37	2					712	717		10.2134/jeq2007.0073	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.0073								18396559					WOS:000253929600050
J	Zingel, P; Haberman, J				Zingel, Priit; Haberman, Juta			A comparison of zooplankton densities and biomass in Lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv (Estonia): rotifers and crustaceans versus ciliates	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The abundance and biomass of ciliates, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods were studied in Lake Peipsi and Lake Vortsjarv, both of which are shallow, turbid and large. Our hypothesis was that in a large shallow eutrophic lake, the ciliates could be the most important zooplankton group. The mean metazooplankton biomass was higher in Peipsi than in Vortsjarv (mean values and SD, 1.8 +/- 0.7 and 1.3 +/- 0.6 mg WM l(-1)). In Peipsi, the metazooplankton biomass was dominated by filtrators that feed on large-sized phytoplankton and are characteristic of oligo-mesotrophic waters. In Vortsjarv, the metazooplankton was dominated by species characteristic of eutrophic waters. The planktonic ciliates in both lakes were dominated by oligotrichs. The biomass of ciliates was much greater in Vortsjarv (mean 2.3 +/- 1.4 mg WM l(-1)) than in Peipsi (0.1 +/- 0.08 mg WM l(-1)). Ciliates formed about 60% of the total zooplankton biomass in Vortsjarv but only 6% in Peipsi. Thus, the food chains in the two lakes differ: a grazing food chain in Peipsi and a detrital food-chain in Vortsjarv. Consequently, top-down control of phytoplankton can be assumed to be much more important in Peipsi than in Vortsjarv. When the detrital food chain prevails, the planktonic ciliates become the most important zooplankton group in shallow, eutrophic and large lake. Neglecting protozooplankton can result in serious underestimates of total zooplankton biomass since two-thirds of the zooplankton biomass in Vortsjarv comprises ciliates.

The aim of this research was to determine the biogeochemical processes in gravel pits that have a positive effect on the groundwater quality in the alluvial aquifer in NW Croatia. The aquifer is situated below developed agricultural land, with high groundwater nitrate concentrations having been recorded over the last decades. The differences between two gravel pits and the surrounding groundwater were studied using in situ, hydrochemical, and isotopic parameters (delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3), together with existing microbial data. The analyses of nitrogen species indicated that nitrate attenuation processes take place in gravel pits. Bacterial denitrification and nitrate uptake by algae were responsible for significant decreases in nitrate concentration. These processes were more effective in the inactive gravel pit, which has a longer water residence time and during warm periods, when microbial biomass, abundance, and activity were high. The seasonally variable microbial activity also affected trace metals, removing them from groundwater, possibly through the biosorption of metal ions. The presented research shows that the observed biogeochemical processes are associated with seasonal changes that affect the types and number of microbial communities and the chemical composition of water, resulting in gravel pits being groundwater remediation points.

Ross; Collins, Pamela; Brown, Susan J.; Koehler, Geoff			Influence of wetlands on nutrients in headwaters of agricultural catchments	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												We investigated the influence of land cover on nutrient concentrations (295 samples) in headwater streams over a 2-year period in 10 agriculture-dominated subcatchments (163-8373 ha) in southern Ontario Canada. In this region, monitoring and research on nutrient dynamics in headwater wetlands is sparse. Our results indicated a significant positive correlation (Pearson coefficient ? = 0.320) between soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the headwater streams and the percentage of wetlands in these agriculture-dominated catchments. This result suggests that headwater wetlands, and other wet riparian zones, are key sources of SRP in the headwater streams. Nitrate concentrations were positively correlated with % agricultural land cover (? = 0.316), consistent with previous studies, while SRP concentrations were negatively correlated with % agricultural land cover (? = -0.325). There was a significant positive correlation between SRP concentrations and discharge in some of the streams. Seasonal SRP trends appear to be closely related to temperature-dependent seasonal changes in redox conditions, including levels of dissolved O-2. Surficial geology had some influence on nitrate concentrations in the streams, which tended to be higher in catchments dominated by glacial till (till terrain), compared to catchments with extensive areas of outwash sand, in addition to till terrain.

Annual average microcystin concentrations of the 187 Florida lakes ranged from nondetectable (<0.1 mu g/L) to 12 mu g/L, with concentrations in individual water samples (N = 862) ranging from nondetectable to 32 mu g/L. Only 7% of all the individual samples exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking guidance value of 1 mu g/L. Three individual water samples collected from two lakes (0.3%) exceeded the WHO recreational guidance value of 20 mu g/L. Using chlorophyll concentrations and Secchi depth measurements, tables were constructed to predict the probability that microcystin concentrations exceeded the WHO guidance values in Florida lakes. Additionally, six hypereutrophic lakes (Harris Chain of Lakes, Lake County, FL) were studied from Sep 2006 to Aug 2007 and 40% of the samples exceeded 1 mu g/L but none exceeded 20 mu g/L. This study also provides baseline information and relations between trophic status, seasonality, water chemistry and microcystin concentrations in Florida lakes.																			1040-2381						2009	25	3					264	275		10.1080/07438140903136555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140903136555													WOS:000269667600004

Most information deals with Egypt; few studies have been done in Sudan, Ethiopia and Tanzania. Egypt is the most populous, agricultural and industrial country in the basin. Therefore, most sewage release to the river takes place in Lower Egypt. Lakes in northern Egypt are affected by drainage of polluted water and this affects the diversity of their fish, phytoplankton and other microorganisms. Nile pollutants are derived from sources such as industrial wastewater, oil pollution, municipal wastewater, agricultural drainage, and include natural cyanotoxins. In order to monitor pollutants, test organisms are needed in which these compounds can be traced at the tissue level. Various fish, shellfish, aquatic animals, aquatic plants and algae are used for this purpose.

J	Jellyman, D				Jellyman, Don			A review of radio and acoustic telemetry studies of freshwater fish in New Zealand	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Radio and acoustic telemetry have been used in 24 studies of freshwater fish in New Zealand. Although most native species are too small to carry these tags, studies using telemetry have been carried out on four of the larger species, i.e. lampreys (Geotria australis), shortfin and longfin eels (Anguilla australis and A. dieffenbachii) and giant kokopu (Galaxias argenteus). Among the introduced species, telemetry has been used to study movements of brown and rainbow trout (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) in both rivers and lakes, chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) and bullhead catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus). To date, studies have almost exclusively been of short-term movements and seasonal migrations. Study objectives range from measuring microhabitats and home ranges to determining the extent of seasonal spawning migrations. The advent of progressively smaller tags will provide increased opportunities to use this technology on a wider range of fish species. Management implications of several studies are presented. Although biotelemetry studies have not yet been used in New Zealand, there are considerable opportunities for using such technology to increase understanding of fish energetics and also stress associated with catch-and-release practices in recreational fishing.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2009	60	4			SI		321	327		10.1071/MF08112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF08112													WOS:000265540200007

In order to assess the impact of exotic species oil native fish communities, the ecology and biology of intruders need to be thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was to analyse the growth and reproductive biology of the ruffe Population in Lake Piediluco. Front June 1999 to March 2002, and between July 2004 and May 2005, 1 330 specimens belonging to seven age-classes were captured. Sex was determined in 385 individuals: 327 females and 58 males. The SL-TL relationship for the whole sample was TL = 0.923 + 1.075SL. The SL-W relationship was W = 0.0154 SL3.102 for females and W = 0.0157 SL3.106 for males. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve for length using back-calculated SL were L-infinity = 218.29 mm, k = 0.27 y(-1), t(0) = -0.61 for females and L-infinity = 161.54 mm, k = 0.32 y(-1), t(0) = -0.70 for males. The results showed that in Lake Piediluco ruffe grow as fast as in their original environments. Seasonal growth and back-calculation showed the possible existence of differential mortality prejudicial to small specimens. Moreover, growth analysis revealed marked sexual dimorphism in growth in the Lake Piediluco population. Sexual maturation occurred in both sexes at the end of the first year of life. Reproduction occurred mostly in May and June. The mean diameter of eggs was 1.12 mm. The mean number of eggs produced by each female was 11 96 1, and increased with the size of the specimens; with regard to relative fecundity, an average value of 239 eggs g(-1) was observed. This analysis reveals some important biological characteristics of the ruffe that were not previously well known with regard to the Italian population of the species.					lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; Pace, Roberta/KUC-4999-2024; Carosi, Antonella/M-4474-2016	lorenzoni, massimo/0000-0002-8548-9487; 													0139-7893	1573-1189					2009	58	4					420	435																WOS:000273179000007

Subannual models for catchment management: evaluating model performance on three European catchments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Models' abilities to predict nutrient losses at subannual timesteps is highly significant for evaluating policy measures, as it enables trends and the frequency of exceedance of water quality thresholds to be predicted. Subannual predictions also permit assessments of seasonality in nutrient concentrations, which are necessary to determine susceptibility to eutrophic conditions and the impact of management practices on water quality. Predictions of subannual concentrations are pertinent to EC Directives, whereas load estimates are relevant to the 50% target reduction in nutrient loading to the maritime area under OSPAR. This article considers the ability of four models ( ranging from conceptual to fully mechanistic), to predict river flows, concentrations and loads of nitrogen and phosphorus on a subannual basis in catchments in Norway, England, and Italy. Results demonstrate that model performance deemed satisfactory on an annual basis may conceal considerable divergence in performance when scrutinised on a weekly or monthly basis. In most cases the four models performed satisfactorily, and mismatches between measurements and model predictions were primarily ascribed to the limitations in input data ( soils in the Norwegian catchment; weather in the Italian catchment). However, results identified limitations in model conceptualisation associated with the damping and lagging effect of a large lake leading to contrasts in model performance upstream and downstream of this feature in the Norwegian catchment. For SWAT applied to the Norwegian catchment, although flow predictions were reasonable, the large number of parameters requiring identification, and the lack of familiarity with this environment, led to poor predictions of river nutrient concentrations.					; Lo Porto, Antonio/F-3382-2011	Arheimer, Berit/0000-0001-8314-0735; Lo Porto, Antonio/0000-0002-4000-7106													1464-0325	1464-0333					2009	11	3					526	539		10.1039/b823250d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b823250d								19280032					WOS:000264098400008
J	Rueda, FJ; Cowen, EA				Rueda, FJ; Cowen, EA			Residence time of a freshwater embayment connected to a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The average length of time water remains within the boundaries of an aquatic system is a key parameter controlling the system's biogeochemical behavior. This timescale, generally referred to as the hydraulic residence time, provides a first-order description of multiple and complex processes that drive transport. The procedures to estimate these transport timescales are reviewed and, through the analysis of numerical simulations, the links between residence timescales and the underlying hydrodynamic processes in a canonical freshwater embayment, Little Sodus Bay (LSB), are explored. LSB has negligible through-flow and is connected permanently to Lake Ontario (LO) through a narrow and shallow channel. Exchange in the channel is the result of a multiple balance where spatial thermal variations (baroclinic forcing), oscillations in water level (barotropic forcing), frictional mixing, wind, and the effects of unsteadiness are all important. The simulations indicate that baroclinic processes are the dominant exchange and mixing mechanisms in embayments like LSB. The largest density gradients across the channel are caused by episodic upwelling events in LO during the stratified season, when exchange rates increase by at least an order of magnitude. The mean residence timescales undergo dramatic variations in time and space and, in general, are comparable to the timescales of the systems' variability itself. The simulations reveal that temporal variations of mean residence timescales occur at interannual, seasonal, and down to synoptic timescales, and are closely related to the occurrence and frequency of upwelling events.

Both increases in temperature and nutrient input would be anticipated to alter primary production within these lakes. Consequently, understanding the current relationship between nutrients and productivity is crucial for predicting the effects of climate change. In this paper, we synthesize published data on algal biomass, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, maximum depth, altitude, longitude, and latitude to determine whether average algal biomass differs for temperate and arctic lakes. A total of 57 sources were used, resulting in data for 433 lake-years, ranging in latitudes from 41 to 79 degreesN. Average algal biomass observed during the ice-free season increased significantly with phosphorous levels, but the latitude of the system had a significant negative impact on algal biomass. We briefly outline two major hypotheses, based on existing empirical evidence, for the lower algal yield found in higher latitude systems: The first hypothesis discusses bottom-up control and the influence of abiotic factors on algal biomass. The second hypothesis relates to food chain composition and top-down influences. The latitudinal effect on algal yield suggests that arctic lakes could dramatically increase in productivity if these systems experience increases in temperature and nutrient concentrations as predicted by climate change models.

Nematodes were the most abundant benthic taxa in most lakes but community composition differed markedly. Several relationships between the invertebrate taxa were found but there was no strong evidence that competition or predation shaped the benthic community structure. Most lakes were dominated by a few nematode species with cosmopolitan distribution. Obligate and/or facultative parthenogenetic species were most abundant.

The efficiency of phosphorus accumulation by short -and long-term exposed periphyton developed on polyacrilic substrates was estimated in two basins of the reservoir for water supply -Lake ' Celije (Serbia), to examine the effectiveness of this biological method for phosphorus harvesting in situ. The dynamics of phytoplankton abundance in both basins was also assessed during periphyton exposure. Maximal phosphorus accumulation in both basins was achieved in one-month, two-month and four-month exposed periphyton, each harvested in October, which accumulated 1695, 2897 and 6058 mgTP/m2 in eutrophic and 1845, 3064 and 5405 mgTP/m2 in mesotrophic basin, respectively. The most abundant phytoplankton was detected in the August (132,900 in eutrophic and 28,953 cell/ml in mesotrophic basin), while the sparsest community was recorded in October in both basins (4600 in eutrophic and 117 cell/ml in mesotrophic basin). Inhabiting the same niche and exploiting the same resources, periphyton and phyto-plankton compete fiercely for phosphorus. Phytoplankton occurred to be competitively dominant in assimilating this nutrient from the water column allowing periphyton to increase phosphorus accumulation only during the periods of very low phytoplankton abundance. The results also suggest that the efficiency of phosphorus accu-mulation by periphyton is more closely related to phytoplankton abundance during the exposure period than to the exposure duration. If this method potentially is employed at large scale during the remediation process, the harvesting of substrates exposed during scarce phytoplankton development would be most effective.					; Popović, Slađana/AAF-9493-2020; Predojevic, Dragana/HJA-6794-2022	Jerinkic, Dragana/0000-0003-4939-6969; Popovic, Sladana/0000-0001-7112-5853; 													0925-8574	1872-6992				JUN	2023	191								106963	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.106963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.106963		MAR 2023											WOS:000966928400001

The effect of habitat on the breeding season survival of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the Great Lakes region	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Modeling the effect of habitat on animal survival is critical for understanding population dynamics and developing effective habitat management strategies. Despite the importance of this information, knowledge of survival-habitat associations are often lacking, particularly for waterfowl species. Here we evaluated female Mallard (Anus platyrhynchos Linnaeus, 1758) survival during the breeding season in relation to habitat conditions within each individual's home range. We implanted telemetry transmitters and tracked 283 female Mallards across nine study sites in the Great Lakes region. For each Mallard, we quantified core breeding season home ranges via the creation of utilization distributions (UDs). We then fit known-fate models in the program MARK to predict breeding season survival as a function of the proximity of core home ranges to various habitat types, the proportion of habitat types within the core areas, number of core areas, and home range size. We found that breeding season survival decreased as the proportion of forestland habitat within core home ranges increased (beta = -1.740, SE = 0.787). No additional upland or wetland habitat types significantly affected breeding season survival. Managers striving to increase breeding season survival for Mallards should focus their efforts on restoring habitats in areas with low proportions of forestland habitat to mitigate the risk of predation.

Spatial and temporal distribution of Ligula intestinalis (Cestoda: Diphyllobothriidea) in usipa (Engraulicypris sardella) (Pisces: Cyprinidae) in Lake Nyasa	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												Engraulicypris sardella is an endemic and economically important cyprinid species in Lake Nyasa/Malawi which has recently been infected by the tapeworm Ligula intestinalis. This parasite is known to induce severe pathological and behavioural effects on other cyprinids, including castration, followed by a collapse of infected populations. As a first step to understanding the dynamics between this parasite and E. sardella, we studied the spatial and temporal variation in prevalence over a period of 1 year. Overall prevalence was about 15%, but we observed a consistently higher prevalence in the littoral compared to the pelagic zone. Fish in the upper water levels showed the highest prevalence, with a marked decline with increasing water depth down to 150 m. The proportion of infected fish varied over time, with a significantly higher prevalence in the rainy season. In a huge lake like the Nyasa, with a surface area of 29,000 km(2) and a maximum depth of 785 m, the transmission success of the parasite appears to show large variations in time and space. We suggest that these conditions could lead the parasite to become persistent within the lake, rather than the typical epidemic situation as observed in smaller bodies of water.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				JUL	2018	92	4					410	416		10.1017/S0022149X17000724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X17000724								28818117					WOS:000435646100003

Fine-scale population structure in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) influenced by life history variation in the Husky Lakes drainage basin, Northwest Territories, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Partial anadromy is common within salmonid populations, where resident and anadromous individuals interbreed and overlap in habitat use during portions of life. Deviation to this definition occurs within the Husky Lakes drainage basin (HLDB), Northwest Territories, where freshwater resident, semi-anadromous, and brackish-water resident lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) life history types are documented. In this study, microsatellite DNA variation was assayed to evaluate genetic structuring among life history types from the HLDB and adjacent lower Mackenzie River system. Significant differentiation was resolved among most locations and life histories (global F-ST = 0.192). Brackish-water residents were differentiated from all locations and life histories, including sympatric semi-anadromous individuals, providing evidence for genetically fixed strategies. Also, this provides the first evidence of breeding partial migration in salmonids using brackish-water environments, where brackish-water residents and semi-anadromous migrants interact during the nonbreeding season, but the latter migrate elsewhere to spawn. Alternatively, the lack of genetic differentiation between semi-anadromous and Sitidgi Lake residents suggests conditional mating tactics may also influence partial anadromy. This work provides novel insights into partial anadromy in Arctic salmonids and expands our knowledge of biodiversity in this region.

J	Kawatsu, M; Morimoto, G; Kagami, M				Kawatsu, Masayuki; Morimoto, Gen; Kagami, Maiko			Seasonal changes in the water bird community in Lake Inba: Influence of floating-leaved macrophytes on habitat selection	AQUATIC BOTANY												The abundance of the floating-leaved macrophytes, especially Trapa spp., has increased in many eutrophic lakes, butits effects on waterbirds is not clear. By covering the water surface with their floating-leaves, these macrophytes exert effects that differ from those of submerged macrophytes. In this study, we investigated seasonal changes in the species composition and habitat selection of the waterbird community in the shallow, eutrophic Lake Inba in relation to the presence/absence of native floating-leaved macrophytes (Trapa spp.). The results indicated higher abundances of the eastern spot-billed duck (Anas zonorhyncha), the little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), the great egret (Egretta alba), theintermediate egret (Egretta intermedia), and the Eurasian coot (Fulica atra) in Trapa beds, whereas the great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo was more abundant in the open water without macrophytes. Both great egrets and intermediate egrets seemed to actively choose the Trapa beds as a feeding habitat that allowed them to catch the small fish swimming beneath these plants. Eurasian coots utilized Trapa spp. as food directly, by grazing on its fruits and leaves. Little grebes selected Trapa beds for nesting, especially when their flock size was larger. Conversely, Trapa beds prevented the foraging behavior of great cormorants. In Lake Inba, with its suddenly deep shoreline and lack of shallow areas, there are few potential feeding habitats for waterbirds in the littoral zones.

Temporary lakes may be intensely affected by both scales, and the aquatic macrophyte community can rapidly respond to such environmental changes. Here, we investigate 26 Neotropical temporary upland lakes and describe the species richness and composition as well as the species richness within functional groups and the functional composition of aquatic macrophytes to better understand the effect of spatial and temporal scales on these attributes. Additionally, we highlight the scenarios where we found rare and endemic species during sampling. Our findings mainly suggest that spatial and temporal scales do not affect the total species richness or species richness within the functional groups. However, the temporal scale affects the species composition and functional-group composition. The species composition changes between dry and rainy seasons (beta-diversity), and such change was less dramatic six years after the first sampling. The identical pattern was found for the functional-group composition (functional beta-diversity). We also found small or few endemic species populations that co-occurred with potentially invasive species, which could threaten endemic species and lead to global extinctions. Finally, we suggest that the temporal dynamics of temporary lakes are fundamental in maintaining regional biodiversity. However, this dynamic may change over time by moving towards a future with a more homogeneous aquatic macrophyte assemblage, what may create a scenario with more functionally redundant species. Subsequently, applied ecological studies in such environments to better understand the temporal. dynamics of the aquatic macrophyte community may help to improve future proposals of biodiversity management and protection.

J	Blenckner, T; Omstedt, A; Rummukainen, M				Blenckner, T; Omstedt, A; Rummukainen, M			A Swedish case study of contemporary and possible future consequences of climate change on lake function	AQUATIC SCIENCES												A physical lake model was employed to obtain a basis of discussing the impact of climate variability and climate change on the ecology of Lake Erken, Sweden. The validity of this approach was tested by running the PROBE-lake model for a 30-year period (STD) with observed meteorological data. The lake is adequately modelled, as seen in the comparison with actual lake observations. The validated lake model was then forced with meteorological data obtained from a regional climate model (RCM) with a horizontal resolution of 44 km for present (CLTR) and 2 x CO2 (SCEN) climate conditions. The CUR lake simulation compares reasonably with the STD. Applying the SCEN simulation leads to a climate change scenario for the lake. The physical changes include elevated temperatures, shorter periods of ice cover combined with two of ten years being totally ice-free, and changes in the mixing regime. The ecological consequences of the physical simulation results are derived from the historical dataset of Lake Erken. Consequences of a warmer climate could imply increased nutrient cycling and lake productivity. The results suggest that an application of RCMs with a suitable resolution for lakes in combination with physical lake models allows projection of the responses of lakes to a future climate.

J	Fry, B; Allen, YC				Fry, B; Allen, YC			Stable isotopes in zebra mussels as bioindicators of river-watershed linkages	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Concerns about biodiversity and sustainability extend to many ecological systems, including large river systems that are highly modified by human activities. The Mississippi River is one such system that is currently regulated for navigational and flood control purposes, bears a large agricultural nutrient load, and has experienced rapid spread of the exotic zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, since 1991. Human development of the extensive watershed system of the Mississippi River is ongoing and is expected to lead to further changes in river ecology. This study tested whether stable isotope compositions of the zebra mussel could help identify watershed and tributary loading of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulphur (S) to the mainstem river. Zebra mussels were collected seasonally in the lower Mississippi River at Baton Rouge in 1997, and along most of the length of the river in a north-south transect from Minnesota to Louisiana during August 1998. Results showed substantial seasonal variations in C, N and S isotopic compositions of 2parts per thousand or greater, but also that seasonal changes appeared regular and linked to changing watershed inputs and chemistry of the river water. Nitrate was the dominant N nutrient in the Mississippi River, but isotope analyses showed that food webs based on ammonium rather than nitrate were likely important for the zebra mussel. Results from the north-south transect followed expectations based on mixing of mainstem river water with tributaries that had different chemistries, so that local zones of influence were detectable in the combined CNS zebra mussel isotopes downstream of major tributary confluences for the Illinois, Missouri and Ohio Rivers. Overall, the study supports use of stable isotopes to help monitor watershed development and downstream effects on aquatic food webs. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Analysed water parameters have shown notable seasonal variations and were within the acceptable range for inland surface water. Water quality index (WQI) and organic pollution index (OPI) values have displayed 'poor' to 'heavily polluted' status in the pre-monsoon season, with marginally better conditions during the post-monsoon studies. Trophic state indices (TSIs) values revealed 'eutrophic to highly eutrophic' conditions during the investigation period. The results of the PCA have depicted three major determining factors (i.e., anthropogenic contribution, geogenic or weathering, and seasonal/climatic factors) that control the overall pollution level in the lake water system. The current study can potentially be a benchmark for assessing and undertaking management and restoration measures for this nascent alpine ecosystem.					; Rai, Atul Kumar/IUM-9136-2023	Nayek, Sumanta/0000-0002-1164-4210; Rai, Atul Kumar/0000-0002-2640-3188														1751-231X				APR	2023	18	4					967	980		10.2166/wpt.2023.039	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wpt.2023.039		MAR 2023											WOS:000957184700001

This study focuses on the small-scale variability on the environmental distribution of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in mountain soils. Several soil samples taken from May 2007 to June 2008 in a small area at around 1,900 m a.s.l. (Italian Central Alps) were analyzed for DDT compounds. Pedological analyses were done as well. Organic matter content, soil layer, differences in solar radiation, and sampling period were considered as possible variability factors. Organic matter content can account for a DDT concentration difference of a factor 3 among different sites, soil layer can account for a concentration difference of a factor near 2, differences in solar radiation values do not seem to affect DDT concentrations, whereas the sampling period has the greatest influence with a difference factor of three to four among different sampling dates. Summing all these variability factors together, even though operating on such a small scale, we obtain a predicted spatial variability depending on the considered variables near to one order of magnitude. In particular, it was surprising that seasonal variations could be so great. If this conclusion is to be confirmed in the future, this element must be considered very carefully by scientists and environmental agencies during monitoring campaigns.

Epigeal Spider (Araneae) Communities in Moist Acidic and Dry Heath Tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												For the 2004-2006 growing seasons, we trapped a total of 6980 spiders (5066 adults, 1914 immatures) using pitfall traps at the Arctic Long Term Experimental Research (LTER) site in Toolik Lake, Alaska. We found 10 families and 51 putative species, with 45 completely identified, in two distinct habitats: Moist Acidic Tundra (MAT) and Dry Heath (DH) Tundra. We captured spiders belonging to the following families (number of species captured): Araneidae (1), Clubionidae (1), Dictynidae (1), Gnaphosidae (4), Linyphiidae (26), Lycosidae (11), Philodromidae (2), Salticidae (1), Theridiidae (1), and Thomisidae (3). Statistical comparisons of families captured at MAT and DH Tundra indicate that the habitats have significantly different spider communities (Chi Square Test: p < 0.0001, and Fisher's Exact Test: p = 0.0018). This finding is further supported by differences in similarity, diversity, evenness, and species richness between the two habitats. In this report, we present eight new state records and five extensions of previously described ranges for spider species. The following species are new state records for Alaska: Emblyna borealis (O.P.-Cambridge 1877), Horcotes strandi (Sytschevskaja 1935), Mecynargus monticola (Holm 1943), Mecynargus tungusicus (Eskov 1981), Metopobactrus prominulus (O.P.-Cambridge 1872), Poeciloneta theridiformis Emerton 1911, and Poeciloneta vakkhanka (Tanasevitch 1989). The following five species have been reported previously in Alaska, but not near Toolik Lake: Hypsosinga groenlandica Simon 1889, Gnaphosa borea Kulczyn'ski 1908, Gnaphosa microps Holm 1939, Haplodrassus hiemalis (Emerton 1909), and Islandiana cristata Eskov 1987. Pairwise similarity indices were calculated across 13 other arctic and subarctic spider communities and statistical tests show that all sites are dissimilar (p = 0.25). These results fit the general pattern of both the patchiness and habitat specificity of arctic spider fauna.

The procedure utilized available daily climate data from 182 stations and employed a regression based interpolation scheme at 500 metre grid spacing. Spatial distribution of temperature took into account variations in temperature with elevation, an observed north-south temperature gradient, and proximity to several large lakes in the valley bottom. An inverse distance weighting scheme was used for the interpolation, and a constrained lapse rate approach was used to interpolate in areas that lie above the highest climate station. Temperature inversions were handled by fitting a second order polynomial and introducing a two-layer model. The precipitation routine differs from the temperature model in that the regressions were based on monthly precipitation totals, thus producing daily precipitation surfaces that incorporate an orographic component along with latitudinal trends. A "leave one out" cross-validation procedure was applied to 56 stations to test model performance. Cross-validation of the predicted surfaces indicated that, on average, the daily maximum temperature surfaces were more accurate than the daily minimum temperature surfaces. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) averaged 1.0 degrees C for maximum temperature while for minimum temperature MAE was in the range of 1.3 degrees C to 1.8 degrees C depending on the season. Errors in both temperature and precipitation surfaces are largest at higher elevations where station density is low. Over all stations, monthly MAE for precipitation averaged between 10% and 18%. A MAE calculated from differences between observed and predicted annual precipitation over all stations was 27 mm with a percent error of 6.2%. The model shows a positive bias (1.4) in the daily occurrence of precipitation resulting in an over-prediction of days with drizzle. Over 80% of incorrectly predicted wet days had less than 1 mm precipitation. These error statistics compare favourably to those from similar regression-based interpolation models.																			0701-1784	1918-1817				SUM	2010	35	2					131	154		10.4296/cwrj3502131	http://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj3502131													WOS:000280750100002
J	Rai, PK				Rai, Prabhat Kumar			Seasonal monitoring of heavy metals and physicochemical characteristics in a lentic ecosystem of subtropical industrial region, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Assessment of seasonal changes in surface water quality is an important aspect for evaluating temporal variations of lentic ecosystem (lakes and reservoirs) pollution due to industrial effluent discharge. In this study, nine metals and 15 physicochemical parameters, collected from four sampling sites in a tropical lake receiving the discharge from thermal power plant, coal mine, and chloralkali industry, during the years from 2004 to 2005, were analyzed. For greater efficacy in monitoring of heavy metals, particle-induced X-ray emission has been used during present investigation. Different statistical techniques like analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, principal component analysis, and factor analysis were employed to evaluate the seasonal correlations of physicochemical parameters. Most of the metals and physicochemical parameters monitored in the present study exhibited high spatial and temporal variability. Pertaining to metal pollution, the most polluted site was Belwadah, i.e., waters and sediments had the highest concentration of all the relevant metals. The reference site was characterized by the presence of low concentrations of metals in waters and in sediments. Based on the high metal concentration recorded in lake ambient, drinking, bathing, and irrigation water should not be used by the local people at the effluent discharge points.

The main goal was to test how consistently different taxonomic groups ordinate 9 sites distributed along the pond's main axis. Microcrustaceans were more abundant during the dry season, characterized by waters with high transparency and dissolved oxygen concentration. An increase in species richness and densities of rotifers and testate amoebae was detected during rainy season, with low values of Secchi disk and concentrations of dissolved oxygen. However, the ordination patterns generated by these groups were different. Concordant patterns across sites were found only between cladocerans and copepods. These results suggest that great care should be taken when ordination patterns based on some taxonomic groups are extrapolated to other groups for detecting environmental changes.

Substantial progress has been made in the control of Japonicum in both China and the Philippines. China is reaching elimination thanks to a concerted effort of control strategies. Mathematical modelling has been a key tool in the design of control strategies, in place of expensive randomised-controlled trials. We conducted a systematic review to investigate mathematical models of Japonicum control strategies in China and the Philippines.Methods: We conducted a systematic review on July 5, 2020, in four electronic bibliographic databases -PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS and Embase. Articles were screened for relevance and for meeting the inclusion criteria. Data extracted included authors, year of publication, year of data collection, setting and ecological context, objectives, control strategies, main findings, the form and content of the model including its background, type, representation of population dynamics, heterogeneity of hosts, simulation period, source of parameters, model validation and sensitivity analysis.Results After screening, 19 eligible papers were included in the systematic review. Seventeen considered control strategies in China and two in the Philippines. Two frameworks were identified; the mean-worm burden framework and the prevalence-based framework, the latter of which increasingly common. Most models considered human and bovine definitive hosts. There were mixed additional elements included in the models, such as alternative definitive hosts and the role of seasonality and weather. Models generally agreed upon the need for an integrated control strategy rather than reliance on mass drug administration alone to sustain reductions in prevalence.Conclusions: Mathematical modelling of Japonicum has converged from multiple approaches to modelling using the prevalence-based framework with human and bovine definitive hosts and find integrated control strategies to be most effective. Further research could investigate the role of other definitive hosts and model the effect of seasonal fluctuations in transmission.

J	Mergeay, J; Verschuren, D; De Meester, L				Mergeay, J; Verschuren, D; De Meester, L			Daphnia species diversity in Kenya, and a key to the identification of their ephippia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The distribution of Daphnia species in tropical Africa is poorly known and understood. Daphnia are assumed rare in tropical regions, but systematic studies covering large areas are sparse. We sampled the active community (live zooplankton) and/or the dormant community (diapausing egg banks in the sediment) of 41 standing water bodies in Kenya in search for Daphnia. Overall the dormant communities yielded 11 species of Daphnia, a species richness more than twice the species richness found in the active communities. Dormant community species diversity better reflects the spatial, and particularly the temporal (multi-annual) variation in environmental conditions available to Daphnia in these tropical standing waters. Hence, we suggest that the dormant community be taken into account when assessing local zooplankton diversity, especially in fluctuating tropical lake ecosystems, where the presence of each local Daphnia species in the active community may be strongly seasonal or erratic. Geographic distribution data from this study are supplemented with previous records of Daphnia in East Africa to provide an overview of the known distribution of Daphnia in Kenya and neighbouring countries. We also present a detailed key for morphological identification of the ephippia of the 11 Daphnia species encountered, complemented with photographs and drawings of diagnostic characters.

Response of thicket swamp species to soil moisture levels: Implications for restoration	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands dominated by shrubs are ubiquitous features in the Great Lakes Region of North America, yet little is known about the interactions between plants and the environmental conditions of these ecosystems. We measured the response of seven common wetland shrub species and two forbs to soil moisture treatments over a growing season. Average soil moisture content across three treatments ranged from <30% to >75%. These soil moisture differences produced a measurable effect on plant growth for six of the nine species tested. While Rosa palustris and Spiraea alba preferred the highest soil moisture treatments, Salix interior, Sambucus nigra, and Solidago uliginosa had higher biomass from moderate soil moisture, with no effect observed for Cornus sericea, Salix discolor, and Viburnum lentago. Most of the growth differences were from aboveground portions of the plants. A significant difference in root-to-shoot ratio (R:S) was found for eight of the species, with contrasting directions of change between the soil moisture treatments. New growth was compared to mean stomatal conductivity to determine an estimated water use efficiency (WUEe), which demonstrated a montonal relationship for six of the species across the measured soil moisture regime. Only the upland goldenrod, Solidago altissima, demonstrated the expected increase in WUEe with decreasing soil moisture, which suggests wetland shrubs are inefficient at low soil moisture. The results of this study provide quantitative data on the range of responses to soil moisture of common species of shrub wetlands, which can be used by wetland managers to improve restoration success.

J	Keeton, WS				Keeton, William S.			Evaluation of tree seedling mortality and protective strategies in riparian forest restoration	NORTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY												Riparian forest restoration can be severely constrained by tree seedling mortality. I evaluated the effects of tree shelters and planting density on herbivory and seedling mortality at a restoration site in the Lake Champlain Basin of Vermont. Eighteen experimental units were established along a 5th-order stream and planted with bare-root seedlings of seven species associated with northern hardwood floodplain forests. Two treatments were applied in a factorial design: shelters versus no shelters and high versus low planting density. Mortality and herbivory data were collected over three growing seasons. Survivorship declined to 56.4% after three growing seasons and varied significantly by species. Planting density, presence/absence of shelters, and their interaction had significant effects on survival, browse, or girdling intensity when tested for all species combined. Browse rates were high (44%), whereas girdling rates were low (3.4%). Both browse (P < 0.001) and girdling (P = 0.022) contributed to seedling mortality. High rates of deer browse on seedlings in shelters were due, in part, to the short height (60 cm) of the shelters, suggesting a need for taller shelters. A large portion (39%) of dead seedlings were neither browsed nor girdled, signaling the importance of other mortality agents. An adaptive approach is recommended to compensate for high seedling mortality and the limited effectiveness of protective devices.																			0742-6348	1938-3762				SEP	2008	25	3					117	123		10.1093/njaf/25.3.117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/njaf/25.3.117													WOS:000258861900001

Comparisons between Consumption Estimates from Bioenergetics Simulations and Field Measurements for Walleyes from Oneida Lake, New York	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Daily consumption was estimated from the stomach contents of walleyes Sander vitreus collected weekly from Oneida Lake, New York, during June-October 1975, 1992, 1993, and 1994 for one to four age-groups per year. Field rations were highly variable between weeks, and trends in ration size varied both seasonally and annually. The coefficient of variation for weekly field rations within years and ages ranged from 45% to 97%. Field estimates were compared with simulated consumption from a bioenergetics model. The simulation averages of daily ration deviated from those of the field estimates by -20.1% to +70.3%, with a mean across all simulations of +14.3%. The deviations for each time step were much greater than those for the simulation averages, ranging from -92.8% to +363.6%. A systematic trend in the deviations was observed, the model producing overpredictions at rations less than 3.7% of body weight. Analysis of variance indicated that the deviations were affected by sample year and week but not age. Multiple linear regression using backwards selection procedures and Akaike's information criterion indicated that walleye weight, walleye growth, lake temperature, prey energy density, and the proportion of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum in the diet significantly affected the deviations between simulated and field rations and explained 32% of the variance.

X.; Zhang, Mingjun; Wang, Shengjie			Suspended sediment and total dissolved solid yield patterns at the headwaters of Urumqi River, northwestern China: a comparison between glacial and non-glacial catchments	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												In order to understand the differences in the suspended sediment and total dissolved solid (TDS) yield patterns between the glacial and non-glacial catchments at the headwaters of Urumqi River, northwestern China, water samples were collected from a glacier catchment and an empty cirque catchment within the region, during three melting seasons from 2006 to 2008. These samples were analyzed to estimate suspended sediment and TDS concentrations, fluxes and erosion rates in the two adjoining catchments. There were remarked differences in suspended sediment and TDS yield patterns between the two catchments. Suspended sediment concentrations were controlled mainly by the sediment source, whereas TDS concentrations were primarily related to the hydrologic interaction with soil minerals. Generally, the glacial catchment had much higher suspended sediment and TDS yields, together with higher denudation rates, than the non-glacial catchment. Overall, glacial catchment was mainly dominated by physical denudation process, whereas the non-glacial catchment was jointly influenced by physical and chemical denudation processes. The observed differences in material delivery patterns were mainly controlled by the runoff source and the glacial processes. The melting periods of glacier and snow were typically the most important time for the suspended sediment and TDS yields. Meanwhile, episodic precipitation events could generate disproportionately large yields. Subglacial hydrology dynamics, glaciers pluck and grind processes could affect erodibility, and the large quantities of dust stored on the glacier surface provided additional sources for suspended sediment transport in the glacial catchment. These mechanisms imply that, in response to climate change, the catchment behaviour will be modified significantly in this region, in terms of material flux.

Conventional varve counting techniques use thin sections to manually identify lamina. However, this technique is destructive, labour intensive and limited to a 2D representation of complex 3D features which may lead to misidentification of varve boundaries. This study presents the use of microcomputed tomography (mu CT) scans in constructing varve chronologies, utilizing scanning resolutions of -50 mu m (binned to -200 mu m) for core sections up to 150 cm long. To evaluate this method, we cored and analysed Lake Sagtjernet in Eastern Norway - revealing a 593 cm-long sediment record of the past 10274 (+220/-329) years, with continuous laminations from 84 to 533 cm depth (75% of the sediments). Through limnological monitoring and microfacies analyses we demonstrate that the laminations are rare ferrogenic varves, with an annual deposition pattern comprised of seasonal changes in biogenic production superimposed on seasonal precipitates of iron and manganese hydroxides. The floating mu CT-counted varve chronology presented here is the first non-glacial varve chronology in Norway and covers 4023 +113/-185 years. We find that mu CT scans allow for a very fast and nondestructive way of counting varves with sufficient detail of varve boundaries. In the few sections where varve boundaries are too vague to resolve, we recommend using complimentary techniques such as thin sections in parallel. The varve chronology is in good agreement with the 95% confidence interval of the independent radiocarbon chronology based on 16 14C dates, and 210Pb and 137Cs activity peaks, indicating that the varve chronology can be equated to calendar age.

Climate forcing of regional fire years in the upper Great Lakes Region, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Background. Drivers of fire regimes vary among spatial scales, and fire history reconstructions are often limited to stand scales, making it difficult to partition effects of regional climate forcing versus individual site histories. Aims. To evaluate regional-scale historical fire regimes over 350 years, we analysed an extensive fire-scar network, spanning 240 km across the upper Great Lakes Region in North America. Methods. We estimated fire frequency, identified regionally widespread fire years (based on the fraction of fire-scarred tree samples, fire extent index (FEI), and synchronicity of fire years), and evaluated fire seasonality and climate-fire relationships. Key results. Historically, fire frequency and seasonality were variable within and among Great Lakes' ecoregions. Climate forcing at regional scales resulted in synchronised fires, primarily during the late growing season, which were ubiquitous across the upper Great Lakes Region. Regionally significant fire years included 1689, 1752, 1754, 1791, and 1891. Conclusions. We found significant climate forcing of region-wide fire regimes in the upper Great Lakes Region. Implications. Historically, reoccurring fires in the upper Great Lakes Region were instrumental for shaping and maintaining forest resilience. The climate conditions that helped promote widespread fire years historically may be consistent with anticipated climate-fire interactions due to climate change.

Sexual difference in PCB congener distributions of burbot (Lota Iota) from Lake Erie	CHEMOSPHERE												Concentrations of 86 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined for 25 adult female and 25 adult male burbot (Lota Iota) from Lake Erie. Significant differences in mean proportions of total PCB concentration between males and females ages 14-17 were found for 26 congeners. Males generally had higher mean proportions of hexachloro congeners, whereas females had higher mean proportions of more highly chlorinated congeners. In contrast, only four congeners exhibited differences between males and females ages 6-13 in mean proportions of total PCB. Therefore, the sexual difference in PCB congener distribution widened for older burbot. Males ages 14-17 also had higher proportions of certain hexachloro congeners than the other three demographic groups (males ages 6-13, females ages 6-13, and females ages 14-17) we examined. The reverse was true for more highly chlorinated congeners. The results supported a previous hypothesis that older male burbot spent a substantial amount of time feeding in the vicinity of mouths of rivers with sediment contaminated with PCBs. However, additional studies are needed to clarify and corroborate this apparent "hot spot" effect, such as seasonal movements, spatial distributions, and diet of burbot; and PCB congener distributions of various species of prey fishes captured at various locations throughout the eastern basin of Lake Erie and at different locations in the contaminated rivers.

Considering the level of manganese and arsenic in the dead isaza during the event was much higher than that in live isaza, hypoxia-induced mobilization of manganese and arsenic and subsequent exposure could be the reason for this adverse effect. However, secondary accumulation of manganese and arsenic after the mortality event could not be ruled out To test this hypothesis, we conducted tissue distribution/speciation analysis and absorption tests on dead specimens All the results, particularly the limited absorption of arsenic in the absorption tests, indicated that the isaza were exposed to arsenic before the mortality event. Parallel to this, the geochemical behavior of manganese and arsenic in oxygen rich conditions (June) and oxygen poor conditions (December) was investigated to verify the mechanism of exposure. Considerable enrichment of manganese and arsenic in a thin surface layer of sediment was a common feature in all seven stations studied. In the water at the bottom of the lake, a clear increase of arsenite in December was observed, and the manganese level was several hundred times higher in both seasons than the average level of the lake. Although further verification is needed, the data provided here support exposure to manganese and arsenic under hypoxia.

Using 5-m(2) field enclosures, we examined the effects of Elodea canadensis on zooplankton communities and on the trophic cascade caused by 4-5 year old (approximately 16 cm) roach. We also tested the hypothesis that roach in Elodea beds use variable food resources as their diet, mainly benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates, and feed less efficiently on zooplankton. Switching of the prey preference stabilises the zooplankton community and, in turn, also the fluctuation of algal biomass. The factorial design of the experiment included three levels of Elodea (no-, sparse- and dense-Elodea) and two levels of fish (present and absent). 2. During the 4-week experiment, the total biomass of euplanktonic zooplankton, especially that of the dominant cladoceran Daphnia longispina, decreased with increase in Elodea density. The Daphnia biomass was also reduced by roach in all the Elodea treatments. Thus, Elodea provided neither a favourable habitat nor a good refuge for Daphnia against predation by roach. 3. The electivity of roach for cladocerans was high in all the Elodea treatments. Roach were able to prey on cladocerans in Elodea beds, even when the abundance and size of these prey animals were low. In addition to cladocerans, the diet of roach consisted of macroinvertebrates and detrital/plant material. Although the biomass of macroinvertebrates increased during the experiment in all Elodea treatments, they were relatively unimportant in roach diets regardless of the density of Elodea beds. 4. Euplanktonic zooplankton species other than Daphnia were not affected by Elodea or fish and the treatments had no effects on the total clearance rate of euplanktonic zooplankton. However, the chlorophyll a concentration increased with fish in all the Elodea treatments, suggesting that fish enhanced algal growth through regeneration of nutrients. Thus, our results did not unequivocally show that Elodea hampered the trophic cascade of fish via lowered predation on grazing zooplankton. 5. In treatments with dense Elodea beds (750 g FW m(-2)), chlorophyll a concentration was always low suggesting that phytoplankton production was controlled by Elodea. Apparently, the top-down control of phytoplankton biomass by zooplankton was facilitated by the macrophytes and operated simultaneously with control of phytoplankton production by Elodea.

J	Maruoka, N; Urabe, J				Maruoka, Natsumi; Urabe, Jotaro			Competitive abilities and distribution ranges of four asexualDaphnia pulexlineages andDaphnia mitsukuriin Eurasian continental islands	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Daphnia pulexandD. mitsukuriare morphologically similar and distributed in small lowland Japanese lakes.D. pulexin Japan reproduces by obligate parthenogenesis and is composed of four different lineages (JPN1-JPN4) with North American origins. Although this species is found throughout Japan, JPN1 has the largest distribution range, followed by JPN2.D. mitsukuriis a putatively endemic species that is now rarely found in Japan. SinceDaphniashare the same algal food, the difference in distribution ranges among the four asexualD. pulexlineages andD. mitsukurimay be caused by exploitative competition for algal food. To examine this possibility, we measured the threshold food concentration (TFC) at zero-net growth rate and the food concentration required for 50% of the individuals to survive (FC50). In addition, we examined the effects of temperature on the somatic growth rate (SGR) and the mortality rates of four asexualD. pulexlineages andD. mitsukuri. The experiments showed that TFC was lowest inD. pulexJPN1 and highest inD. mitsukuri, supporting the idea that the largest distribution range of JPN1 is due to its superiority in inter-lineage competition, and that the distribution area ofD. mitsukuriis reduced through exploitative competition withD. pulex. However, although JPN2 was found in relatively large areas, it had higher TFC than JPN3 and JPN4, which appear in very limited areas. These results clearly showed that the difference in distribution ranges amongD. pulexlineages are not necessarily determined by their competitive superiority alone.					; Urabe, Jotaro/A-6256-2012; Urabe, Jotaro/ACO-1029-2022	Maruoka, Natsumi/0000-0002-6405-621X; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; 													1438-3896	1438-390X				JUL	2020	62	3					353	363		10.1002/1438-390X.12054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12054		JUN 2020											WOS:000539586200001

A mathematical model for the control of swimmer's itch	NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING												Swimmer's itch is an emerging disease caused by flatworm parasites that often use water birds as definitive hosts. When parasite larvae penetrate human skin they initiate localized inflammation that leads to intense itching. Concerns about this issue have been growing recently due to an apparent increase in the global occurrence of swimmer's itch and its subsequent impacts on recreational activities and associated revenues. Past study has identified the common merganser as a key definitive host for these worms in the United States; a number of snail species serve as intermediate hosts. Although previous attempts at controlling swimmer's itch have targeted snails, a handful of efforts have concentrated on treating water birds with the anthelmintic drug, praziquantel. We construct a mathematical model of swimmer's itch and its treatment within the infected merganser population. Our goal is to identify merganser treatment regimes that minimize the number of infected snails thereby reducing the risk of human infections. Optimal control of bird hosts is defined analytically and we include numerical simulations assuming different resource-allocation strategies. Results from the study may help identify treatment protocols that lower merganser infection rates and ultimately reduce the occurrence of swimmer's itch in freshwater systems throughout the Midwest. Recommendations for Resource Managers Regardless of the time and monetary resources available, praziquantel treatment frequency should increase as mergansers arrive on the lake with continued treatments (albeit at reduced levels) until the end of the residency period. Allocating plenty of resources towards the treatment of mergansers predicted a sharp drop in infected birds, which then remained close to zero throughout the remainder of the residency period. This approach reduced schistosome infection in mergansers and kept snail infections within the idealized range during times of peak recreational activity. Consequently, human cases of swimmer's itch would be expected to be low to nonexistent. Furthermore, our treatment-longevity computation suggested that subsequent praziquantel dosing would not be required for a number of years. Under more limited resources, the number of birds treated per day was much smaller throughout the residency period; however, even under these circumstances (which equated to treating approximately one bird every 5 days), simulated infected merganser densities were reduced to the point where snail infections remained below epidemic levels through to the end of the recreational period. Treatment longevity was shorter compared with the high-resource option, but still extended 122 days into Season 2 (posttreatment). We also used our model to investigate situations where lake managers and/or federal agencies might be taxed in terms of the time available to continuously treat mergansers on a given lake. An individual scientist may only have a single day (or two) to dose birds, rather than continuously administering praziquantel throughout the birds' residency period. If <77% of the total number of arriving birds can be treated in a single day, we recommend praziquantel administrations when the number of mergansers reaches the maximum that can be successfully treated. In addition, model simulations demonstrate that if managers are able to treat a large number of birds, they should wait until the end of the migration period.

Age at maturity was negatively correlated with size of young-of-the-year perch in the end of their first growth season. Length at maturity was positively correlated with L-infinity (asymptotic length when age is close to infinity) and negatively correlated with K (growth rate coefficient) from von Bertalanffy growth model. Relative predator abundance was negatively correlated with minimum size at maturity. However, predation was probably more important in its effect on growth, with a high predation leading to a decrease in population density, decreased food competition, and as a consequence, higher growth rates. Instantaneous mortality rates did not affect maturation patterns when comparing across the five lakes. Age and size at maturity in the perch populations studied here seemed to be mainly influenced by factors affecting growth.

By hydroacoustic surveys, recruitment of 0+ year vendace could clearly be detected. In contrast, gillnet catches resulted in low numbers of 0+ year fish, and similarly under-represented proportions of the oldest vendace. Consequently, the correlation between hydroacoustics and gillnets with respect to fish numbers and geometric mean fish total length was high only for the age groups 1+ to 4+ years. Annual variability in hydroacoustic estimates of fish abundance and biomass was high (CV = 26-29%) which reflects the seasonal population dynamics of vendace.

If a mechanism relating crustal deformation to radon emanation or electrical signals does indeed exist, it is thought to involve fluids(12-19). Some preliminary insight has been gained into these processes from the study of natural systems under controlled mechanical and hydrological conditions(20). Here we report electric potential variations, radon emanation and deformation measurements recorded since 1995 in the French Alps in the vicinity of two artificial lakes which have strong seasonal variations in water level of more than 50 metres. We observe that electric potential variations and radon emanations are repeatedly associated with transient deformation events induced by variations in lake levels. These events are characterized by a change in ground tilt which deviates from the expected elastic response, and are associated with periods of accelerating strain, which suggests that accelerated loading can enhance fluid transport properties. Qualitatively, this behaviour can be accounted for by a model in which straining induces fluid overpressure and dynamic flow in cracks. These observations may shed light on the sensitivity of rock transport properties to deformation.

Delivering New Technologies to the Tanzanian Sweetpotato Crop Through Its Informal Seed System	AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												The concept of integrated seed sector development (ISSD) for sweetpotato was tested in Shinyanga and Meatu districts of the Lake Zone of Tanzania. Agricultural Research Institute (ARI)-Ukiriguru documented the informal system. It comprised male and female vine multipliers with land close to water sources growing sweetpotato during the dry season. They sold vines during the rainy season, with male multipliers and those with larger crops selling more. The average multiplier supplied approximately 50 farmers who commonly travelled 20 km, each buying approximately 1-2 bundles of vine and provided an entry point for disseminating technologies. ARI-Ukiriguru organized demonstrations of rapid multiplication, inorganic and organic fertilizers and new cultivars on multipliers' land. Fertilizer could economically more than double vine yields with huge potential benefits for an area where production is constrained by planting material; some multipliers immediately began using it. Multipliers took rapid multiplication and new cultivars to their home gardens for further experimentation, seeming likely to adopt especially the cultivar NASPOT 1. A strategy of growing large quantities of irrigated sweetpotato in Misungwi and selling the vines long-distance in Shinyanga, a marketing strategy derived from Uganda, was also adopted. These successes confirm the value of formal-informal seed sector interactions in ISSD.																			2168-3565	2168-3573				SEP 14	2015	39	8					861	884		10.1080/21683565.2015.1046537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2015.1046537													WOS:000359674700003

Investigations were based on bimonthly or monthly sampling over 2 yr (1997 to 1998) conducted at 1 representative station with 2 sampled depths (0.5 and 5 m near the bottom). Limnological parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, light, dissolved inorganic nutrients) were simultaneously measured to determine the possible factors affecting the phytoplankton composition. We determined 30 taxa during the survey which were numerically dominated by the class Chlorophyceae. However, both in terms of abundance and biomass, Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community with Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Wolsz.) Seenayya et Subba Raju. This species can represent biomass close to 96-100% of total phytoplankton biomass, with values reaching 70 mg l(-1) (fresh weight) between April and November 1998. Over the survey, the filaments of C. raciborskii were coiled (average of 97%) with a mean proportion of 12.3% of terminal heterocytes. The species toxicity was determined from bioassay analysis and the presence of neurotoxins was revealed during the bloom. By March 1998, chlorophyll concentration reached 135 mu g l(-1) at the surface level, inducing a sharp decrease of the euphotic zone depth. Favorable environmental conditions were observed for the bloom with high temperatures, high pH, low N/P ratio, and absence of efficient predators. The nutrient context seemed to play a role in the cyanobacterial bloom despite the absence of external nutrient supply. However, annual rain deficit and lack of water renewal in 1998 linked to the 1997 EI Nino consequences seem to be the major factors responsible for both hypereutrophic conditions and cyanobacterial blooms in the reservoir studied. Thus, global climate change can influence phytoplankton population dynamics in continental waters, as demonstrated frequently in oceanic ecosystems.

Additionally we compared the lacustrine data to those of marine (Mediterranean cored sequences, Arabian Sea surface sediments and Monterey outcrop sediments) and hypersaline sediments (Vena del Gesso marls) as well as marine suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the Black Sea. Regular isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and glycerol dialkyl diethers (GDDs) were the most abundant membrane-spanning lipids in all investigated settings (>90 % and 84 % respectively). Interestingly, GDGTs with a cyclohexyl ring (S-GDGTs) were also present in almost all investigated lake sediments, in relative abundances of ca. 2-7 % and, for the first time, also their S-GDD counterparts were detected (2-10 %). The producers of S-GDGTs are still unknown, however our results show that it is likely that bottom water anoxia (both seasonally induced or permanent) is the driving factor for the production of these lipids, whereas previous studies suggested euxinia was required for production. Unsaturated GDGTs (uns-GDGTs, ca. 2 %) were only detected in Lake Chala sediments and surface sediments from Azorean lakes, but without accompanying unsGDDs. GMGTs, glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers, were present in Messel oil shale and marine samples, while GMDs were only found in Messel oil shale.

Effect of gender on sap-flux-scaled transpiration in a dominant riparian tree species:: Box elder (Acer negundo)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] Acer negundo is a dioecious riparian tree species with a spatial segregation of the sexes along soil moisture gradients. Females are typically more common in wet sites along streams ( typically F/M approximate to 1.6), whereas males are more common in drier sites away from streams ( typically F/M approximate to 0.6). Spatial segregation between sexes may develop because of the higher reproductive cost in females compared to males. If so, female Acer negundo trees would be under stronger selection to maximize resource uptake, and would therefore likely occur at greater frequencies in high resources sites (i.e., along streamsides), and increase rates of resource acquisition (i.e., water and nutrients). The spatial segregation of the sexes leads to the hypothesis that male and female individuals have varying influence on ecosystem evapotranspiration. To address this, stem sap flux was measured on mature streamside ( <= 1 m from stream channel) and nonstreamside (> 1 m from stream channel) male and female Acer negundo trees occurring in Red Butte Canyon near Salt Lake City, Utah, during the 2004 growing season. Despite having similar predawn and midday water potentials, sap flux density was 76% higher in streamside female trees than in males ( P < 0.0001), while sap flux density was 19% greater in nonstreamside female trees compared to males ( P < 0.0001). Mean daily sap flux density of all A. negundo populations was highly correlated with mean daily vapor pressure deficit ( P < 0.0001), and was moderately correlated with mean daily photosynthetic active radiation ( P = 0.0263). At the watershed scale, nonstreamside male and female A. negundo trees contributed 20 and 21% respectively to the estimated 1.7 mm d(-1) transpiration flux from dominant riparian vegetation away from streamsides ( estimated from scaled sap flux measurements of all dominant riparian tree species in Red Butte Canyon). Male and female A. negundo trees contributed 31 and 46% respectively of the estimated 8.0 mm d(-1) transpiration flux from dominant riparian vegetation adjacent to the stream channel. Results from this investigation show that the population structure of dioecious riparian trees has direct consequences on ecosystem ET, particularly along stream margins. Shifts in population structure therefore, may have profound impacts on several ecohydrological processes including stream discharge, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystem productivity.

J	Rodriguez, MA; Lewis, WM				Rodriguez, MA; Lewis, WM			Structure of fish assemblages along environmental gradients in floodplain lakes of the Orinoco River	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Fish assemblages of temperate lakes are structured primarily by an interaction between piscivory and a small number of environmental variables, but tropical floodplain assemblages have often been viewed as unpredictably structured. We tested the predictability of fish assemblage structure in floodplain lakes of the Orinoco River, Venezuela, in relation to 22 variables describing environmental variation at the microhabitat, habitat, and supra-lake levels. Fish species abundances were estimated through electro-fishing surveys of 20 lakes in three regions for the early and late dry seasons of each of two consecutive years. Canonical correspondence analyses indicated that assemblage structure was predictably related to only four descriptors of lakes: transparency, conductance, depth, and area. Discriminant function analyses revealed that transparency (''clear'': Secchi transparency >20 cm; or ''turbid'': Secchi transparency less than or equal to 20 cm) was tightly associated with the numerical density of six major taxa (82% classification accuracy) and the numerical density of piscivorous species (89% accuracy). Depth and area probably derived their significance from causal relationships to transparency and availability of cover, whereas the influence of conductance arose incidentally through an association with biogeographical zonation. Mantel tests indicated that similarity in structure of assemblages was not strongly related to the distance between lakes. Transparency was a remarkably reliable predictor of species composition. Fish with sensory adaptations to low light were dominant in turbid lakes, whereas visually oriented fishes predominated in clear lakes; seasonal change involved decline in the proportion of visually oriented fishes concomitant with a decline in transparency. The effect of transparency on assemblage structure was probably mediated by the relationship of transparency to visibility of prey. The structuring of Orinoco fish assemblages by piscivory, under the influence of transparency as controlled by depth and area, contrasts with previous views emphasizing random assemblage variation in neotropical floodplain lakes and extends the applicability of a conceptual model originally developed for temperate lakes.

Among aquatic assemblages, birds constitute a conspicuous group that provides many ecosystem services. Here, we use a metacommunity approach to understand the influence of spatial (distance among patches) and environmental factors (local characteristics) in wading bird (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) assemblages in a river-floodplain system through time. We tested the hypothesis that, due to the small scale of our study, spatial factors have no determinant role in waterbird assemblages, and, due to the annual occurrence of flood pulses, the importance of environmental factors varies through time, according to the hydrological cycle. We tested this hypothesis using Partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA). We used abundance data for the birds in 20 lagoons, sampled quarterly during two years. The spatial factors did not explain variation in community structure in any sampled month, whereas environmental factors explained variation in the assemblages only in two months. Due to high waterbird mobility, the non-significance of the spatial factor is expected among lagoons in the same floodplain. Environmental factors are important in determining the community structure only in two sampled months, evidencing that their importance varies through time in the floodplain, partially agreeing with our hypothesis. The non-conformity between the influence of environmental factors on assemblages and the hydrological cycle may be due to human impacts caused by the operation of upstream reservoirs, which alter the natural flood events, and caused a long drought period previous to this study. A multiscale approach is fundamental to the understanding on how anthropogenic impacts on wetlands affect waterbird assemblages. Thus, this study contributes to the understanding of how seasonality, environmental conditions of lakes, and a local spatial scale act in structuring waterbird assemblages.					; dos Anjos, Luiz/F-9501-2012; Silva, Camila/AAP-1296-2021; Almeida, Bia/M-7569-2019	Almeida, Bia/0000-0001-9738-0270; Barbosa Silva, Camila/0000-0002-6403-8716; 													0103-5657					DEC	2016	24	4					314	322																WOS:000397400300004

The Use of an Orographic Precipitation Model to Assess the Precipitation Spatial Distribution in Lake Kinneret Watershed	WATER												A high-resolution 3-D orographic precipitation model (OPM) forced by Climate Forecast System (CFS) reanalysis fields was developed for the Lake Kinneret watershed (Israel-Syria-Lebanon territories). The OPM was tuned to represent the interaction between the advected and stratiform rainfall, and the local orographic enhancement. The OPM evaluation was focused on the densely instrumented lower part of the watershed. To evaluate the ungauged upper-elevation, bias-adjusted precipitation estimates from the Global-Hydro-Estimator were used. The OPM simulates higher rainfall amounts in the upper-elevation watershed compared to currently used rainfall estimates from an elevation dependent regression. The larger differences are during rain events with southwesterly wind flow and high moisture flux. These conditions, according to the OPM, are conducive to enhanced orographic lifting in the Hermon Mountain. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the higher wind speeds for southwesterly-northwesterly trajectories generate significant orographic lifting and increase the precipitation differences between the lower and upper elevations.																			2073-4441					DEC	2016	8	12							591	10.3390/w8120591	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8120591													WOS:000392480200044

State of emerging technologies for assessing aquatic condition in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A survey of institutions that operate emerging technologies used to monitor water quality and environmental conditions in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence system was conducted in 2015. Data were summarized with the aim to provide insight into the current status of these aquatic environment observing systems at a time when these technologies are recognized to have great value but full implementation of observing systems is not yet in place. Fifty-three emerging technology observing platforms were described; over half of the systems were operated by institutions with multiple systems. Most emerging technology operators were from academic institutions and the largest (most expensive) emerging technology observing platforms were operated by government agencies. Physical properties were the most common water qualities measured. Lake Erie had the greatest number of emerging technology platforms making observations whereas the rivers connecting and draining the system had the least. Most observations were made in ice-free seasons. Data from these observing platforms were primarily used for sharing with other end-users. Emerging technologies can help resource managers make more informed decisions to meet the objectives of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and improve dissemination of public information. Technological and non-technological innovation is necessary for successful establishment of cost-effective system-wide observatory that can support bi-national obligations to monitor ecosystem restoration and protect water quality throughout the Great Lakes system.

J	Ko, S; Lautala, P; Zhang, KL				Ko, Sangpil; Lautala, Pasi; Zhang, Kuilin			Data-Driven Study on the Sustainable Log Movements: Impact of Rail Car Fleet Size on Freight Storage and Car Idling	SUSTAINABILITY												Rail car availability and the challenges associated with the seasonal dynamics of log movements have received growing attentions in the Lake Superior region of the US, as a portion of rail car fleet is close to reaching the end of its service life. This paper proposes a data-driven study on the rail car peaking issue to explore the fleet of rail cars dedicated to being used for log movements in the region, and to evaluate how the number of cars affects both the storage need at the sidings and the time the cars are idled. This study is based on the actual log scale data collected from a group of forest companies in cooperation with the Lake State Shippers Association (LSSA). The results of our analysis revealed that moving the current log volumes in the region would require approximately 400-600 dedicated and shared log cars in ideal conditions, depending on the specific month. While the higher fleet size could move the logs as they arrive to the siding, the lower end would nearly eliminate the idling of rail cars and enable stable volumes throughout the year. However, this would require short-term storage and additional handling of logs at the siding, both elements that increase the costs for shippers. Another interesting observation was the fact that the reduction of a single day in the loading/unloading process (2.5 to 1.5 days) would eliminate almost 100 cars (20%) of the fleet without reduction in throughput.

AQUATIC BOTANY												Four Chara lakes, differing in their morphological features, physico-chemical water properties, catchment area characteristics and human pressure, were studied in order to recognize the influence of the charophyte PVI, proportion in the phytolittoral zone and species composition on phytoflagellate community. In one lake, the proportion of vegetation was lower than 50 % of the lake's area while in the other lakes it was higher, in one of them reaching almost 70 %. Phytoflagellate diversity, biomass and relative biomass (proportion in total phytoplankton biomass) were studied monthly during the growing season. Both small and shallow as well as large and deep Chara lakes supported high proportion of phytoflagellates exceeding even 90 % of the total phytoplankton biomass, but our results suggest lake-specificity in the composition of phytoflagellates. Phytoflagellate species appeared among the phytoplankton dominants in each month and in each lake. Out of four phytoflagellate groups examined, the biomass of cryptophytes and relative biomass of haptophytes differed significantly in the Chara lakes studied. Cryptophytes were related to the human pressure on one hand and to the cover of charophyte vegetation on the other hand. The use and type of catchment area seem to be the main factors influencing the biomass and the structure of phytoflagellate assemblage.

Spatial and Thermal Ecology of Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in a Small, Dystrophic Lake in Central Michigan	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												- Understanding the interface between spatial and thermal ecology is integral to understanding energy acquisition and the life histories of ectotherms. Snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) occupy a wide range of habitats that vary greatly in their thermal properties. We studied activity, movements, and thermoregulation of C. serpentina in a small, land-locked lake in central Michigan, USA, using radiotelemetry. Consistent with our a priori predictions, turtles were active within core areas along the lake's edge, showed both diurnal and nocturnal activity, and did not make extensive interwetland movements. Turtles left the lake only for nesting or to hibernate in Sphagnum peat or in the banks of a nearby stream. Home range and core area size estimates of C. serpentina were small compared with other previously studied populations, perhaps in part because of the small dimensions of our lake. Contrary to our prediction of a broad T-set (thermoregulatory set-point) range for a large-bodied, habitat generalist turtle, we found a comparatively low and narrow laboratory-determined T-set range (22 degrees C-26 degrees C). Turtle body temperatures (T-b) cycled between May and August and attained maximal values during the evening hours, a pattern that likely results from thermal inertia, the selection of aquatic thermal patches, or both, as T-e (operative temperatures) declined. Turtles most effectively maintained T-b within T-set during July and August when thermal conditions were most favorable. Throughout most of the active season the highly aquatic habits of C. serpentina apparently negated the effects of variations in daily weather conditions and their effects on incoming levels of solar radiation on variation in T-b. However, turtles maintained higher average T-b on sunny days compared with overcast days in April and May, the coolest months of the study. Diet T-b cycling ceased during September and October and average T-b declined despite favorable thermal conditions, at least during September, a pattern that could reflect a downward shift in the T-set range. Comparatively, C. serpentina is less effective at thermoregulating than is a small-bodied species at a similar latitude (Chrysemys pieta marginata). Apparently, thermal inertia and lack of atmospheric basking proclivities influenced the thermoregulatory precision in our turtles.

Seasonal availability of environmental nutrients alters density and stoichiometric quality (carbon-nutrient ratios) of both producers and consumers, suggesting that nutrient availability may drive fluctuations in parasite prevalence patterns observed in nature. We examined the interactions between the population dynamics of a keystone herbivore, Daphnia, and its parasites, and their associations with water nutrient concentrations, resource quantity and quality, and other environmental variables (temperature, pH, oxygen concentration) in a small lake, using general linear models. We found that the prevalence of two gut endoparasites was positively related to food source and quality as well as nitrogen content of Daphnia, whereas the prevalence of an epibiont and overall parasite species richness was negatively related to phosphorus content of Daphnia. When only endoparasite species richness was considered, no connections to nutrients were found. Daphnia density was not connected to parasites, but we found interactions between Daphnia fecundity and parasite prevalence. Overall, our results suggest that environmental nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric quality of the host have the potential to affect seasonality in parasite epidemics, but the connections between environmental carbon : nutrient ratios and parasite prevalence patterns are diverse and species specific.					; Aalto, Sanni/AAY-5338-2021; Ketola, Tarmo/AAD-2609-2019	Aalto, Sanni L/0000-0002-6724-2632; Pulkkinen, Katja/0000-0002-1480-2464; Ketola, Tarmo/0000-0001-5151-7980													0012-9658	1939-9170				SEP	2014	95	9					2558	2568		10.1890/13-2007.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-2007.1													WOS:000342340200018
J	Birkett, C; Murtugudde, R; Allan, T				Birkett, C; Murtugudde, R; Allan, T			Indian Ocean climate event brings floods to East Africa's lakes and the Sudd marsh	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During an El Nino, the expected rainfall increase over most of the Lake Victoria catchment area is similar to 15-25%. However, due to anomalous warming of the western equatorial Indian Ocean during 1997, strong convection developed over parts of the Horn and eastern Africa. This resulted in a much larger 20-160% precipitation excess during the "short rainy" season. Satellite radar altimetry data reveals that not only did Lake Victoria rise by similar to 1.7 m, but that the rainfall event similarly affected lakes Tanganyika, Malawi and Turkana. In addition, the seasonal level minima of the Sudd marshes and Lakes T'ana and Nasser continue to increase. Such a rainfall event will have severe, longterm consequences for the natural surface flows and storages along the White Nile. Based on the hydrological impacts of the historic 1961 East Africa event, we can expect the current high levels of Lake Victoria to be maintained for the remainder of this decade. In addition, we anticipate a major expansion of the permanent swamp regions of the Sudd marshes over the forthcoming seasons. Blue Nile flows, further enhanced by the above-average 1998 rainfall season, can also be expected to remain high, at least until early 1999.

J	Eloranta, AP; Perälä, T; Kuparinen, A				Eloranta, Antti P.; Perala, Tommi; Kuparinen, Anna			Effects of temporal abiotic drivers on the dynamics of an allometric trophic network model	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Current ecological research and ecosystem management call for improved understanding of the abiotic drivers of community dynamics, including temperature effects on species interactions and biomass accumulation. Allometric trophic network (ATN) models, which simulate material (carbon) transfer in trophic networks from producers to consumers based on mass-specific metabolic rates, provide an attractive framework to study consumer- resource interactions from organisms to ecosystems. However, the developed ATN models rarely consider temporal changes in some key abiotic drivers that affect, for example, consumer metabolism and producer growth. Here, we evaluate how temporal changes in carrying capacity and light-dependent growth rate of producers and in temperature-dependent mass-specific metabolic rate of consumers affect ATN model dynamics, namely seasonal biomass accumulation, productivity, and standing stock biomass of different trophic guilds, including age structured fish communities. Our simulations of the pelagic Lake Constance food web indicated marked effects of temporally changing abiotic parameters on seasonal biomass accumulation of different guild groups, particularly among the lowest trophic levels (primary producers and invertebrates). While the adjustment of average irradiance had minor effect, increasing metabolic rate associated with 1-2 degrees C temperature increase led to a marked decline of larval (0-year age) fish biomass, but to a substantial biomass increase of 2-and 3-year-old fish that were not predated by =4-year old top predator fish, European perch (Perca fluviatilis). However, when averaged across the 100 simulation years, the inclusion of seasonality in abiotic drivers caused only minor changes in standing stock biomasses and productivity of different trophic guilds. Our results demonstrate the potential of introducing seasonality in and adjusting the average values of abiotic ATN model parameters to simulate temporal fluctuations in food-web dynamics, which is an important step in ATN model development aiming to, for example, assess potential future community-level responses to ongoing environmental changes.

Evaluating Golden-winged Warbler use of alder and aspen communities managed with shearing in the western Great Lakes	ECOSPHERE												Best management practices are often written by researchers to guide land managers and landowners in the creation of habitat for wildlife species of interest. These documents are based on research evaluating the habitat needs of a species, but they also describe tools and strategies managers can implement to create or restore desired conditions. Shrub and sapling shearing is a management practice often used to improve habitat for early-successional species, yet little monitoring or research has focused on wildlife response to shearing. The goal of this research was to formally evaluate the effect of shrub and sapling shearing as a best management strategy for Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) conservation at a regional scale. Specifically, we surveyed for male Golden-winged Warblers during the breeding season in sheared sites and untreated reference sites across portions of the western Great Lakes to assess the effects of (1) management status (i.e., sheared aspen or alder vs. untreated sites) and (2) patch-level vegetation characteristics on male abundance. We found that male Golden-winged Warbler abundance was twice as high in sheared sites than in mature reference sites and peaked when sapling cover was similar to 40%. Male abundance was also negatively associated with percent cover of forbs and nonvegetated ground. These findings highlight the importance of patch-level heterogeneity when implementing shearing treatments for Golden-winged Warblers and demonstrate the potential need for pretreatment site assessments to help focus conservation efforts for this species. Ultimately, our results support the use of a site-specific, nuanced approach to shearing implementation to maximize cost efficiency and desired species outcomes.					; Roth, Amber/A-9913-2018	McNeil, Darin/0000-0003-4595-8354; Buckardt Thomas, Anna/0000-0002-9269-5668; 													2150-8925					MAR	2023	14	3							e4443	10.1002/ecs2.4443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4443													WOS:000957866500001
J	Vione, D				Vione, Davide			Photochemical reactions and the self-depuration of sunlit freshwaters	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: ECOLOGY												Reactions induced by sunlight (direct photolysis and indirect photochemistry) are important ecosystem services that aid freshwater bodies in removing contaminants, although they may also exacerbate pollution in some cases. Without photoinduced reactions, pollution problems would be considerably worse overall. The photochemical reaction rates depend on seasonality, depth, water chemistry (which also significantly affects the reaction pathways), and pollutant photoreactivity. Photochemical reactions are also deeply impacted by less studied factors, including hydrology, water dynamics, and precipitation regimes, which are key to understanding the main impacts of climate change on surface-water photochemistry. Climate change is expected in many cases to both exacerbate freshwater pollution, and enhance photochemical decontamination. Therefore, photochemical knowledge will be essential to understand the future evolution of freshwater environments.

Based on the core-periphery theory of geography, this paper selected three counties in the marginal zone of the CTP uninhabited area with significant transitional physical geography features and socio-economic conditions as case areas. We used the data set of settlement patches identified by visual interpretation in Google Earth Pro, combining them with field survey data to study the evolution of human settlements on the CTP, the characteristics of settlement layout, and their socio-economic roots. The study found that: (1) Since the democratic reform in Tibet, the production mode of herders on the CTP has transitioned from four-season nomadic herding to cold-season sedentary grazing, warm-season rotational grazing, and then to a combination of sedentary grazing and forage supplementation. In structural changes of grassroots organizations, village boundaries were clarified, grazing ranges were fixed, and settlement systems were formed. (2) On a large scale, the settlement layout on the CTP showed a certain degree of agglomeration in local areas, but the settlements' spatial agglomeration decreased as the observation scale decreased. The settlement size structure matched the typical rank-size rule of rural settlements. (3) The settlement layout of the CTP showed significant traffic lines and dominant location orientation. These orientation characteristics revealed "core-periphery" regional differences. Changes in production conditions, such as artificial grass cultivation and part-time employment, affected the dependence on traditional grazing points. Settlements moved from resource dependence to dependence on multiple elements, such as resources and facilities. The religious, cultural heritage of the sacred mountains, lakes, and temples influenced the settlement layout, leading to clustering in local areas and to group format. This study expands our understanding of the settlement pattern in the marginal zone of uninhabited areas and provides valuable references for advancing the optimization of the CTP human settlement system in the new era.

Seasonal water sources at irrigated urban vegetable production sites in Ghana	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Studies on water use in urban agriculture in developing countries have largely focused on wastewater reuse and its associated health concerns. However, there is some heterogeneity in the choice of water sources of urban farmers in a developing country such as Ghana, where agricultural infrastructure is not fully developed. Therefore, this study explores the choice of water sources during the rainy and dry seasons by urban farmers since it has implications for food security in urban areas and beyond. Using chi-square and multinomial logit regression, this paper assesses urban farmers' choices for different water sources in Ghana during the rainy and dry seasons and examines the associated factors driving these choices. The results show that most urban farmers use rainwater and wastewater during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively, but small lakes/rivers are the least used during both seasons. Also, the choice of water sources at different locations is influenced by farm and non-farm characteristics. The paper concludes that there is heterogeneity in the choice of water sources among urban farmers at different locations during different seasons. We recommend that stakeholders involved in promoting and sustaining urban agriculture must help in building a solid infrastructure for sustainable irrigation.

Landscape-scale variation in the seed banks of floodplain wetlands with contrasting hydrology in China	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. At a local scale, the species composition, diversity and spatial variation of wetland plant communities are determined primarily by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in their environments. Less is known about variation at a landscape-level. The floodplain of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River in China includes hydrologically connected, subtropical wetlands with different hydrological characteristics. 2. We examined seed-bank species composition and richness in marshes of two contrasting hydrological types: permanent marshes, fed by local runoff, and lakeshore marshes more closely connected to the regulated river. Lakeshore marshes are flooded annually to depth of approximately 1 m and during flooding they support an alternate, aquatic vegetation type. The soil seed bank in March was a comparative estimator of species diversity. At the beginning of the growing season it included seeds from both phases of alternating vegetation types associated with the annual hydrological cycle. 3. A regional pool of 101 species was detected in the seed banks of six wetlands associated with the river and its tributaries: 56 occurred in permanent marshes and 59 in lakeshore marshes, with only 15 common to both. Species rarefaction curves indicated that more species occurred in permanent than lakeshore marshes at equal numbers of individuals sampled. However, the more heterogeneous lakeshore seed banks were estimated (Chao 2) to have greater total species richness (81) than permanent marsh (60). 4. Analysis using Sorensen's coefficient of similarity and DCA ordination revealed complex variation, with much greater differences between hydrological types than within them, irrespective of geographical distance. The types also differed significantly in the composition of four functional groups of species. 5. Despite the potential for dispersal of propagules via the annually pulsing river system (hydrochory), at a regional and landscape scale, diversity is maintained largely by large-scale temporal hydrological heterogeneity and smaller scale spatial and topographic heterogeneity.

Knowing the natal origin and homing/straying rate of the salmonids in colonised environments is essential to under-standing the dispersal mechanisms and developing management plans. In the last two decades, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha showed the greatest natural dispersal capacity in Patagonia. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the environmental strontium isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr) as a potential natural tag to infer the natal origin and ontogenetic habitat use of salmonids in Patagonia, specifically Chinook salmon. 87Sr/86Sr ratio was determined in water samples from 26 sites distributed in 14 Atlantic and Pacific basins in low and high water seasons. Environmental 87Sr/86Sr showed greater spatial than temporal variation, revealing great potential as a tool to infer the natal origin and life history of several migratory fish species in Patagonia. Otolith core-to-edge 87Sr/86Sr profiles were also analysed in 108 Chinook salmon from six basins. A cluster analysis based on the Unweighted Pair Group method (UPGMA) and Euclidean distances without prior classification grouped the sampled rivers into five main groups with significantly dif-ferent (p < 0.05) isotopic ratios, sometimes integrated basins with different slopes (Atlantic or Pacific). The cluster analysis based on the natal 87Sr/86Sr period in otolith (similar to natal origin) showed clear segregation between the Atlantic and Pacific samples. A mismatch between water and otolith natal 87Sr/86Sr ratio was detected in some Atlantic basins (e.g. De las Vueltas River in Santa Cruz Basin) and Pacific (e.g. Liquine Basin) and, which could be explained either by straying behaviours or by large geochemical variability between tributaries, within river systems. Our results showed that 87Sr/86Sr is a useful natural tag to trace the life history of migratory fishes in Patagonia, especially for in-vasive species such as Chinook salmon.

This has been impossible in the past due to inadequate knowledge of commercially important fish stocks. Here we present the first acoustic abundance estimates of fish in Lake Victoria. Five lakewide acoustic surveys were conducted between 1999 and 2001, using the Simrad EY500 echo-integrator with a 120 kHz split-beam transducer. There are many species of fish in Lake Victoria, however, only limited identification of targets can be achieved by present methods. Broad categories were distinguished by visual examination of echo-traces. The echo-integrals were partitioned between four target groups: (1) the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a top predator, (2) small pelagics comprising mainly the dagaa Rastrineobola argentea together with mixed species of haplochromines, (3) the crustacean Caridina nilotica and (4) other species. Spatial and temporal differences in the Standing Crop were observed between north and south, and between shallow and deep water. Most fish were found inshore but the spatial distribution varied between seasons. Mid-lake fish densities were higher in August compared to February. In August, the water column is well mixed while in February it is stratified with a low-oxygen layer inhospitable to fish near the bottom. There are consequent changes in the characteristics of observed echo-traces. Over the survey series, Nile perch biomass showed a consistent decline, while the stocks of small pelagic species increased. We emphasize the need for simple rules to identify species, and hydrographic monitoring to assist echo-trace classification. In the absence of any other source of comprehensive biomass estimates, the value of acoustic surveying in Lake Victoria is demonstrated.

Lee; Gill, Robert E., Jr.			Montane-breeding Bird Distribution and Abundance Across National Parks of Southwestern Alaska	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Between 2004 and 2008, biologists conducted an inventory of breeding birds during May-June primarily in montane areas (>100 m above sea level) of Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve (Aniakchak NMP), Katmai National Park and Preserve (Katmai NPP), and Lake Clark National Park and Preserve (Lake Clark NPP) in southwestern Alaska. Observers conducted 1,021 point counts along 169 transects within 63 10-km X 10-km plots that were randomly selected and stratified by ecological subsection. We created hierarchical N-mixture models to estimate detection probability and abundance for 15 species, including 12 passerines, 2 galliforms, and 1 shorebird. We first modeled detection probability relative to observer, date within season, and proportion of dense vegetation cover around the point, then modeled abundance as a function of land cover composition (proportion of seven coarse-scale land cover types) within 300 m of the survey point. Land cover relationships varied widely among species but most showed selection for low to tall shrubs (0.2-5 m tall) and an avoidance of alpine and dwarf shrub-herbaceous cover types. After adjusting for species not observed, we estimated a minimum of 107 +/- 9 species bred in the areas surveyed within the three parks combined. Species richness was negatively associated with elevation and associated land cover types. At comparable levels of survey effort (n = 721 birds detected), species richness was greatest in Lake Clark NPP (75 +/- 12 species), lowest in Aniakchak NMP (45 +/- 6 species), and intermediate at Katmai NPP (59 +/- 10 species). Species richness was similar at equivalent survey effort (n = 973 birds detected) within the Lime Hills, Alaska Range, and Alaska Peninsula ecoregions (68 +/- 8; 79 +/- 11; 67 +/- 11, respectively). Species composition was similar across all three parks and across the three major ecoregions (Alaska Range, Alaska Peninsula, Lime Hills) that encompass them. Our results provide baseline estimates of relative abundance and models of abundance and species richness relative to land cover that can be used to assess future changes in avian distribution. Additionally, these subarctic montane parks may serve as signals of landscape change and barometers for the assessment of population and distributional changes as a result of warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.					; Amundson, Courtney/K-8088-2019	Amundson, Courtney/0000-0002-0166-7224; 													1944-687X					JUN	2018	9	1					180	207		10.3996/062017-JFWM-050	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/062017-JFWM-050													WOS:000434007200015

Large tropical rivers and tributaries are typically more depth and shows increased flow velocity and area in flood than in dry season. A thorough analysis of seasonality effect on fish community structure can provide valuable information of major forces driving tropical communities. However, these types of analyses have been limited by poor knowledge of tropical diversity, human impacts on environment, and biased sampling methods. We used a pristine large tropical river (and tributaries) and five types (12 gill nets, beach seine nets, longlines, branch baited hooks, and cast nets) of fishing gears to present an evaluation of flow seasonality effect on fish community. We sampled fourteen sites in river channel and tributaries in the lower Araguaia River. Sampling was conducted in flood (March and May 2009) and dry (July and September 2009) seasons of a typical seasonal year. Species richness, Shannon Diversity and Evenness, mean similarity of binary data, and abundance (CPUE) were analyzed by PERMANOVA and PCoA. We also analyzed the species most correlated (by Spearman correlation rank) with flood and dry season. Features differed significantly between flood and dry seasons, but not between channel and tributaries. The composition and abundance of community, and the representative species of flood and dry changed quite along the year. Flood showed lotic-related species, and dry presented lentic-related species. Thus, we achieved an alternation of fish community between season, both for channel and tributaries.					; Orsi, Carlos/AAV-3687-2021; Baumgartner, Dirceu/J-2332-2016	Orsi, Carlos/0000-0002-1837-6757; Message, Hugo/0000-0002-6031-8577; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	2018	101	6					881	897		10.1007/s10641-018-0744-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-018-0744-0													WOS:000432321600002
J	Tokumon, R; Boltovskoy, D; Cataldo, D				Tokumon, Romina; Boltovskoy, Demetrio; Cataldo, Daniel			Effects of the Invasive Freshwater Mussel Limnoperna fortunei on Sediment Properties and Accumulation Rates	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Since its introduction into South America around 1990, the freshwater bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (the golden mussel) has spread rapidly and is now a dominant component of the benthic and periphytic fauna in many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Sizable impacts of this nonindigenous species on nutrient recycling, plankton abundance and composition, and trophic relationships with fishes have been reported, but its effects on the sediments have received little attention. In this work, we use eighteen 20-L flow-through experimental units with and without mussels where changes in the mass and characteristics of the sediments accumulated throughout a yearly cycle in monthly, biannual, and annual intervals are analyzed. Experimental units with mussels yielded almost 2 times more sediments than units without mussels and contained significantly higher loads of organic matter and total N. Total P was not affected by the presence of mussels. Sediments accumulated in the biannual and annual experimental units agreed well with the yields of the monthly units, but the vertical stratification of organic matter, N, and P was unpatterned. Seasonal changes in the volume of total sediments, biodeposits, and their organic matter and N contents were positively associated with ambient water temperature and with intermediate (similar to 150-250 NTU, nephelometric turbidity units) turbidity. Our results suggest that ecosystem-wide modifications in the living conditions of the benthic epifaunal and infaunal organisms in waterbodies invaded by the mussel are likely significant, although variable locally, regionally, and across taxa. Plain Language Summary In the last decades, thousands of plants and animals have spread into new marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats through human-mediated activities. Worldwide, freshwater ecosystems seem to have suffered the most. The Asian golden mussel, a small (similar to 2-3-cm) bivalve mollusk, was introduced in South America around 1990, and by 2017 it was present, often at densities over 200,000 individuals per square meter, in many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs throughout five countries. The mussel, which lives attached to hard substrates, is presently a major biofouling nuisance for many industrial installations and has been shown to affect preexisting biological interactions significantly. In this work we show that in the estuary of the Rio de la Plata (South America), the golden mussel doubles the rates of sedimentation of suspended particles and strongly enhances their contents in organic matter and nitrogen. These effects are likely to increase the rates of accretion along the Rio de la Plata Estuary front and to modify the makeup of the communities that dwell in the sediments. The golden mussel is expected to continue expanding northward, and its impacts will likely affect many of the new waterbodies colonized.

The study was based on analysis of 13 collections with fortnightly and monthly sampling during the dry and rainy seasons, simultaneously recording several environmental factors that supported a comparative analysis for changes in species richness between study sites and collections. An ecological categorization of species allowing to associate their presence with the environmental conditions of the lake area, arguing that the dominant species distinguished floristically a region, while frequent distinguish the local flora and rare species indicate habitat fragmentation. The composition and species richness showed a clear relationship with environmental factors and highlighted the presence of Nitzschia frustulum, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, Fragilaria bidens, Rhoicosphenia abbreviata, Fragilariforma virescens, Staurosira construens, S. construens var. binodis, Staurosirella leptostauron y S. pinnata, which are species typically found in the sediments of shallow and eutrophic bodies of water. Species richness was statistically correlated with the variation of silica and pH, which showed that benthic diatoms can be used as ecological indicators for monitoring environmental conditions in the lake district of Xochimilco-Tlahuac.					; Novelo, Eberto/JSK-9966-2023	Buendia Flores, Marisela/0000-0002-2071-6191; 													2007-4298	2007-4476				SEP	2015	93	3					531	558		10.17129/botsci.148	http://dx.doi.org/10.17129/botsci.148													WOS:000362995200011

In addition, porewater from an adjacent fen was investigated in order to obtain information about the DOC in the catchment area. Size-exclusion-chromatography combined with UV- and organic carbon (IR)-detection was used to quantify DOC and its fractions. The lake had previously been divided into four separate sections by large sheets of plastic, and the DOC composition differed markedly between the four compartments. Spatial variations in HS and PS concentrations were greater than seasonal variations. The high amounts of HS (up to 58%) in the western sections of the lake, indicated influence by subsurface water from the fen, whereas the eastern sections were dominated by PS (up to 35%) of algal origin. These differences could be explained by hydrological conditions, indicating that completely different catchment areas influenced the water chemistry in the separate compartments. By characterizing the HS by their average molecular weight and their aromaticity, three different groups of HS could be distinguished depending on their origin and fate. Microbial degradation of DOC and its fractions differed between two of the compartments during incubation studies over a period of six weeks.

J	Pinson, AO				Pinson, Ariane O.			THE CLOVIS OCCUPATION OF THE DIETZ SITE (35LK1529), LAKE COUNTY, OREGON, AND ITS BEARING ON THE ADAPTIVE DIVERSITY OF CLOVIS FORAGERS	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY												Archaeological models of Clovis adaptations are divided between those that argue for a single hunting adaptation characterized by high residential mobility without fixed territories and those that argue for a diversity of environment-specific adaptations and settlement systems. The Dietz site (35LK1529), the largest Clovis site in the Pacific Northwest, is composed of many overlapping, spatially coherent artifact clusters from which 75 whole and fragmentary fluted points have been recovered. The artifact assemblage is inconsistent with use of the site as a kill, camp, or quarry site. Geoarchaeological data show that the site area during the Clovis occupation was a sparsely vegetated, seasonal playa that is unlikely to have supported large herds of game animals. However, the site sits astride what was probably a major transportation corridor linking highly productive ecosystems in the adjoining basins, and Clovis foragers appear to have camped at Dietz repeatedly while traveling between these nearby basins. The systematic and redundant use of a geographically small landscape by Clovis foragers is inconsistent with expectations based on a model of residentially mobile foragers occupying new territories.					; Pinson, Ariane/IQX-1844-2023	Pinson, Ariane/0000-0002-5470-6952; 													0002-7316	2325-5064				APR	2011	76	2					285	313		10.7183/0002-7316.76.2.285	http://dx.doi.org/10.7183/0002-7316.76.2.285													WOS:000290136300004

Bluegill Coloration as a Sexual Ornament: Evidence From Ontogeny, Sexual Dichromatism, and Condition Dependence	ETHOLOGY												In aquatic environments, visual communication is expected in animals that inhabit clear, shallow waters. Here, we investigate variation in the colorful traits of bluegills, Lepomis macrochirus, to elucidate their possible function. Bluegills use alternative mating tactics whereby males develop into one of two irreversible phenotypes termed parental and cuckolder. Parentals build and defend nests and care for offspring whereas cuckolders obtain matings by sneaking copulations. We hypothesized that bluegill coloration might function as a sexual ornament in parental males and that ornamental coloration might serve as an honest indicator of male quality. We predicted that coloration should be more pronounced in parental males than in females and immature males and should be more pronounced during the breeding season. We also predicted that males in better condition should be more intensely colored than fish in poor condition. To test our predictions, we sampled 510 bluegills during the breeding and post-breeding seasons at nine lakes in southern Ontario, Canada, in 2007. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the coloration of five body regions, aged and sexed each fish, and calculated Fulton's condition factor from morphological measurements. A separate experiment showed that color did not fade several minutes post capture, suggesting that coloration could be measured reliably and consistently. We found that color was influenced by maturity, sex, and season, in the predicted direction, for three body regions (breast, cheek, and opercular flap). We also found that color varied with the condition of males such that males in better condition were darker for the sexually dichromatic ventral and facial regions. Our findings therefore suggest that some colorful traits in bluegills may serve as condition-dependent sexual signals during the breeding season. Our research contributes to a growing appreciation of the importance of visual signaling in aquatic environments.																			0179-1613	1439-0310				MAY	2010	116	5					416	428		10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01755.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01755.x													WOS:000276604000004

Knowledge about the distribution and types of wetlands is in high demand by ecosystem modellers for full greenhouse gas accounting. The scope of this paper is to demonstrate the suitability of satellite radar data for the delineation of wetlands in the tundra and boreal forest biomes of central Siberia, 2. An area of more than 3 million km(2) in central Siberia was investigated using satellite data. It covers freshwater ecosystems of the tundra and non-forested peatlands in tundra and boreal forest biornes. The satellite data represent the growing seasons of 2003/2004. 3. Microwave data were acquired by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument onboard ENVISAT. The multi-temporal capabilities and resolution (150 In x 150 m in WS mode) of the ASAR wide swath mode enabled the detection of dynamic features > 2 ha over this vast area. Scatterometer (QuikScat) data could be employed to distinguish hydro-periods. 4. Wetland types have been identified on the basis of seasonal changes in backscatter. In a first step scatterometer data were used to identify the transition period from frozen to unfrozen conditions over a range of 15 degrees latitude. Inundation patterns and soil moisture changes could be identified for the different hydro-periods and used to classify wetlands. Results for peatlands have been compared with Russian forest inventory data which contain information on wetland distribution. 5. The database of permanently inundated areas is an intermediate product which enables the mapping of wetlands in two ways: (1) identification of seasonal inundation in relation to snowmelt and high permafrost tables and (2) input for density analysis of permanent small and shallow lakes in tundra areas which are important freshwater ecosystems as well as a methane source. Differences in intensity and duration of soil moisture conditions allow the identification of peatlands. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wolf, JM; Hammill, E				Wolf, J. Marshall; Hammill, Edd			Provisioning of breeding habitat by beaver and beaver dam analogue complexes within the Great Salt Lake catchment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Beaver are ecosystem engineers capable of converting free-flowing lotic habitats into a series of lentic ponds, thereby enhancing the wetland area of a riverscape. Process-based riverscape restoration using beaver reintroductions and mimicry (beaver dam analogues, BDAs) are increasingly used to restore functions, the provisioning of services, and improve the resiliency of ecosystems across North America and Europe. Beaver can create breeding habitat for a wide range of species within the highly imperilled class Amphibia by increasing wetland area, increasing emergent vegetation, prolonging wetland hydroperiod, and creating deep ponds. However, it remains unclear whether BDAs are creating suitable breeding habitat for amphibians by adequately emulating crucial ecosystem processes. We investigated the relationships between beaver dam and BDA complexes with amphibian breeding occupancy across four catchments feeding the Great Salt Lake, U.S.A. We surveyed 24 beaver dam complexes and nine BDA complexes during the 2019-2021 breeding seasons with varying levels of water availability. We compared environmental characteristics between beaver and BDA complexes, including elevation, depth, and fish relative abundance among others. We then used occupancy models to evaluate factors affecting breeding occupancy of the most frequently encountered amphibian species, barred tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium). Without accounting for imperfect detection, at natural beaver ponds we recorded barred tiger salamanders in 58% of sites, boreal chorus frogs (Pseduarcris maculata) at 17% of sites, and northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipens) at 4% of sites. Tiger salamanders were the only amphibian found at BDA sites, occupying 11% of those sites. We found that beaver complexes had 3 times less fish relative abundance, were 250m higher in elevation, 32 years older, and 0.43 m deeper than their BDA counterparts. Meanwhile, emergent vegetation height, water temperature, and hydroperiod demonstrated no significant differences between site types. BDAs modified ecosystem processes in a way that only partially replicated modifications by natural beaver dams. Occupancy models suggested that fish relative abundance, altitude, age, and being at the top of the drainage network were the most important variables for predicting tiger salamander breeding occupancy. Overall occupancy rate of tiger salamanders was 60%, while BDA complexes had a modelled occupancy rate of 14% compared to 78% in natural beaver complexes. Survey year did not appear to be an important factor in tiger salamander occupancy despite varying levels of water availability. Beaver and BDA complexes located near the top of their effective drainage or tributary junctions appeared to support amphibian along with fish species, thus boosting local diversity relative to a stream with only fish species. We therefore suggest future beaver restoration efforts target the top of effective drainages to benift both taxa. Overall, we found that while BDAs have the capacity to provide amphibian habitat, their younger age and higher fish abundance may explain why they are less effective than natural dams. Managers should therefore consider that the effects of restoration with BDAs may not be immediate, and future maintenance may be required.

Magnetite weathering in a Vertisol with seasonal redox-dynamics	GEODERMA												We investigated soil samples from a Vertisol in a flat lying flood plain in the savannah woodland of southern Mali, which is characterized by a water regime governed by regularly occurring wet and dry seasons. The soil was subdivided into four horizons which differed in the content and speciation of the redox-sensitive elements and in the length of waterlogging. Magnetically, the profile could be subdivided into two parts. The magnetic susceptibility, the hysteresis parameters M-r, M-s, and B-c, as well as the coercivity of remanence B-cr, indicate that the upper two horizons differed from the lower two horizons by a higher content of magnetite and a larger contribution of multi-domain size magnetite grains as compared to single-domain size grains. A comparison of the chemical and magnetic data suggests that dissolution of magnetite in our soil is driven by a seasonal change between anoxic and oxic conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, microcosms containing freshwater, brackish water and microcosms with different saline concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ppt) inoculated with E. coli/S. paratyphi were monitored up to 34 days at 20 and 30 degrees C. E. coli and S. paratyphi exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.05) survival at 20 degrees C compared to 30 degrees C in all microcosms. Despite fresh/brackish water, E. coli and S. paratyphi showed prolonged survival up to 34 days at both temperatures. They also demonstrated better survival potential at all tested saline concentrations except 25 ppt where a significantly higher (p < 0.0001) decay was observed. Therefore, enhanced survival exhibited by the multi-drug resistant enteropathogenic E. coli and S. paratyphi over a wide range of salinity levels suggest that they are able to remain viable for a very long time at higher densities in all seasons of the year in Vembanadu lake irrespective of saline concentrations, and may pose potential public health risks during recreational activities.					; Abdulla, Mohamed/AAP-1937-2021	Abdulla, Mohamed Hatha/0000-0003-0136-2911; 													1477-8920						2013	11	2					324	332		10.2166/wh.2013.221	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2013.221								23708579					WOS:000323560100013

Total HCHs concentrations ranged from 6.30-53.90 ng L-1, 16.59-148.48 ng L-1, 247.93-459.07 ng L-1 and 3.60-12.50 ng g(-1) in surface water, overlying water, pore water and sediments, respectively, which was at the intermediate level compared to those of other areas in China. Seasonal variations of HCHs were featured by lower concentrations in April, July and November due to the dilution of HCHs caused by a great deal of fresh water being allocated to the Baiyangdian Lake in these months. Sediment-water fugacity ratios of the HCH isomers were used to predict the direction of the sediment-water exchange of these isomers. The sediment-surface water and sediment-overlying water fugacity ratios of HCH isomers averaged 11.4 and 3.0, which is significantly greater than the equilibrium status (1.0), suggesting that the net flux directions were from the sediment to water and the sediment acted as a secondary source to the water. Sediment-pore water fugacity ratios indicated near equilibrium or escape from pore water to sediment, depending on the isomer and sampling time. The difference of HCH concentrations between sediment and water samples were found to be an important factor affecting the diffusion of HCH from the sediment to water.					; Liu, Xinhui/AAN-4751-2020; Cheng, Dengmiao/AAW-7379-2020; Gong, Wenwen/Q-9161-2016; TAO, Li/HIR-4254-2022; liang, gang/ACU-9853-2022	Liu, Xinhui/0000-0002-8171-9214; Gong, Wenwen/0000-0003-1271-4150; Cheng, Dengmiao/0000-0002-5631-5904; 													2050-7887	2050-7895					2013	15	2					423	432		10.1039/c2em30794d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em30794d								25208707					WOS:000315397700012

Seasonal fluxes of phosphate across the sediment-water interface in Edku Lagoon, Egypt	OCEANOLOGIA												Edku Lagoon is a shallow, brackish, coastal wetland located in the north-western part of the Nile Delta. It suffers from a high level of eutrophication, owing to the heavy load of nutrients, especially phosphorus. The purpose of this paper was to study the flux rates of organic and inorganic phosphorus across the sediment water interface in Edku Lagoon. Both the organic and inorganic phosphorus of surface sediments, pore water and their concentrations in the water just above the sediments were used to calculate the flux rates and to derive the geochemical models. These suggest that, at present, the flux of inorganic and organic phosphorus is from water to sediments via the sedimentation of inorganic particles and organic matter. The results show that phosphorus deposition to the sediments exceeds the rate of inorganic phosphorus release from the sediments to the water column. In a steady state, the rates of organic phosphorus release more or less match the rates of deposition. These reflect the imbalance (accumulation) of phosphorus in the geochemical cycle in the lagoon and its highly eutrophic status. Efforts to control the eutrophication of Edku Lagoon have focused on reducing the phosphorus input.						rifaat, ahmed/0000-0003-3177-8694													0078-3234						2013	55	1					219	233		10.5697/oc.55-1.219	http://dx.doi.org/10.5697/oc.55-1.219													WOS:000319843600012

Samples were taken from the littoral and profundal zones of 30 neotropical reservoirs from six different watersheds during two hydrological periods (dry and rainy seasons). The sample units were ordinated, with principal component analyses, according to differences in the sediment grain size, sample depth and dissolved oxygen. The results of a multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP) analysis revealed significant differences in species composition between littoral and profundal zones, trophic status (oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic) and different watersheds. The environment species relationship was tested using redundancy analyses. In order to test which environmental variables, either granulometric or limnological, influenced the Oligochaeta community variability we used a partitioning procedure of inertia. Local variations, including reservoir zone and trophic status, were primarily influenced by differences in sediment type and depth. Significant differences in the total biomass between zones, trophic status, watershed and hydrological period were also demonstrated by a Kruskal Wallis or Mann Whitney test. The most prevalent taxa were the cosmopolitan tubificids Bothrioneurum sp. and Branchiura sowerbyi, and the naidids Dero (Dero) digitata and Pristina breviseta, which are dependent on periphyton for food. Higher biomass values were recorded in mesotrophic reservoirs, due to increased nutrient availability and adequate dissolved oxygen supply. Our results indicate that the Oligochaete community structure is directly influenced by local environmental variation in neotropical reservoirs; and that the sediment grain size is the most important factor in determining the Oligochaete community structure.

The data were compiled by using effort expended and catch obtained by 28 fishing boats during 2012 crayfish fishing season. 28 fishing boats fished 16,867 kilograms of crayfish during the fishing season by using 45,600 pieces of crayfish fyke nets. It is determined that the quantity catch per unit effort (CPUE) varies between 2.74 to 6.35 kg/100 fyke nets/week during the 9 weeks fishing period. The population size at the beginning was estimated to be 28,450 kg (at minimum legal length of >= 10 cm). The 95% confidence interval of this estimation was calculated to be 25,607-32,533 kg.

The amounts of methane emitted from inundated ecosystems in the United States can vary greatly from area to area. Seasonal temperature, water table dynamics, and carbon content of soils are principal controlling factors. To calculate the effect of wetlands (and their potential conversion to other land uses) on global greenhouse gas emissions, information on area covered by various wetland types is needed, along with verified projections of spatial variation in net methane emissions. Both of these variables are poorly known, and estimates are largely unavailable at the country level. Nationwide satellite datasets for the coterminous United States (excluding Alaska) have been combined with ecosystem model predictions of monthly net carbon exchange with the atmosphere to produce the first detailed mapping of methane fluxes from natural wetlands on a monthly and annual basis. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model's predicted mean emission flux of methane from wetlands of the continental United States totaled 5.5 Tg CH4 per year. Ranked in terms of total annual flux, the 10 states with the highest predicted emissions (not considering Alaska) are all located in the Great Lakes region and the southern coastal regions of the country.																				1087-3562					2006	10								22	10.1175/EI200.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/EI200.1													WOS:000243378500001
J	Gathman, JP; Albert, DA; Burton, TM				Gathman, JP; Albert, DA; Burton, TM			Rapid plant community response to a water level peak in northern Lake Huron coastal wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Aquatic plants were sampled in five coastal wetlands of northern Lake Huron during July 1996, 1997, and 1998. Mean annual water levels of Lake Huron changed during this period from 176.37 in (below the long-term average) in January 1996 to above average water levels of 176.83 in in July 1996 to 177.19 in in July 1997 and then declined to 176.88 in by July 1998. Boundaries of plant zones as indicated by distribution of the 1-3 dominant species along permanently established transect points across the wetland did not shift spatially over this 3-year period. Instead, relative abundance (percent of total steins per three 0.25 m(2) quadrats per plot) and presence/absence of plant species responded individually to water level changes within major zones. In 1996, the first season sampled, the wet meadow had recently been inundated by rising water level. In 1997, after more than a year of above average and rising water levels, emergent stem densities were reduced in the Carex/Calamagrostis (sedge/blue-joint) dominated wet meadow and mixed transition sedge, narrow-leafed cattail, and hardstem bulrush (Carex, Typha angustifolia, and Schoenoplectus acutus) dominated zones compared to stem densities in 1996. Stem densities remained low in 1998, even though water levels dropped 31 cm from 1997 levels. The relative dominance (% of stems/3 quadrats/plot) and presence/absence of some plant species changed rapidly in the wet meadow zone in response to increases in water levels in 1997 and to decreases in water levels in 1998. In contrast, changes in emergent species were minimal in the deeper emergent zone dominated by hardstem bulrush. We conclude that temporary flooding and drying in response to water level changes are critical to maintaining a diverse arrray of plant species in the wet meadow zones of these marshes. Furthermore, short-term water level changes do not affect the relative spatial position of major plant zones within the marsh nor the relative abundance of emergent species in the deepest zone.																			0380-1330						2005	31			1			160	170		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70296-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70296-3													WOS:000237404100011

Trace metals were also measured in the Clyde River Estuary over an 11 year period and in five other NSW estuaries ( Hastings River, Hunter River, Georges River, Tillgerry Creek and Lake Pambula) over a 13-month period to determine temporal variability and if diploid and triploid oysters accumulate trace metals differently. There were few significant relationships between trace metal concentrations and mass and no significant differences in trace metal concentrations between female and male oysters. Younger oysters (1.3 years) had significantly higher copper concentrations and higher trace metal variability than mature oysters ( 3 years). Different tissues have different trace metal concentrations with muscle tissues having lower concentrations. Considerable inherent variability occurs in oyster cohorts. Analysing specific tissues did not reduce variability of trace metal concentrations. Comparison of trace metal concentrations at two sites within the Clyde Estuary showed a significant difference in zinc concentrations. Cu, Cd, Zn and Se concentrations were generally higher and less variable in triploids than diploids. Pb had a variable pattern of accumulation with no consistent elevation in diploids or triploids. Inter annual variability of trace metal concentrations was considerable and trace metal concentrations also fluctuated throughout an annual cycle with no clear seasonal trends. Measurement of trace metals at known contaminated locations showed that Saccostrea glomerata accumulates metals in response to contamination. Saccostrea glomerata meet most of the requirements to be a biomonitor of trace metal contamination as they are abundant, sessile/sedentary, easy to identify, provide sufficient tissue for analysis, and accumulate trace metals in response to contamination. However, as trace metal concentrations can vary with mass, age, estuary position, ploidy type and temporally, care must be taken to collect individual organisms of similar mass, age and ploidy type to minimise variability, and from similar consistent positions and times to allow for seasonal changes in environmental conditions. Trace metal concentration variability is higher in young animals, thus to reduce variability, older mature animals could be selected.

Comparisons between the two lake signals show synchronisms, which can only be accounted for by large-scale mechanisms. Lake-level variations associated with the short rains season (October-January) appear to have a prominent effect on the annual lake levels. The relations between lake-level variations and atmospheric circulation indexes are then investigated. Over the period 1946-2000, four indexes are selected to characterize the October-December zonal circulation over the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Over the Indian Ocean two surface zonal wind indexes (ZWIs) are used. For the Pacific, the southern oscillation index (SOI) and the Nino3 index are held to account for the El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO). It is shown that significant overall negative correlations of level fluctuations are preferentially obtained with Indian Ocean circulation indexes. Although ZWI is highly correlated with the ENSO indexes, the latter display weaker relations with East African lake levels. It is shown that, for the 1946-2000 period, the October-December zonal circulation cell over the Indian Ocean plays a key role in the equatorial lake-level anomalies, thus demonstrating their influence on the hydro-climatic interannual variability of a large region. However, lake-level variation is a function not only of regional hydro-climatic conditions, but also of the initial (October) absolute lake level. Higher correlations are evident in a multiple correlation approach taking into account the initial lake level status in addition to the ZWI and ENSO indexes.

The occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms is one of the major environmental problems usually encountered in freshwater prawn farms. This study investigated the effects of pond water depth and aeration mode on phytoplankton communities in selected M. rosenbergii farming ponds in China. We adjusted pond water depth and aeration mode (pond water depth: 1.2 m or 1.8 m; method of aeration: surface or both surface and bottom) to compare and analyze phytoplankton community structure and characteristics between ecological (pond water depth: 1.8 m, both surface and bottom aeration) and traditional (pond water depth: 1.2 m, surface aeration) farming ponds. Water quality parameters were compared in six aquaculture systems, which were measured in situ or lab. The results showed that ecological culture suppressed Cyanophyta abundance and significantly increased the numbers of phytoplankton species leading to a 30.43-136.84% increase in the number of species for ecological ponds compared with that in traditional ponds. In all seasons, ecological culture tended to have decreased total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen, and significantly lower total phosphorus and reactive phosphate compared with traditional ponds. In conclusion, ponds should maintain deeper water depth (1.8 m) and higher N/P ratio (>3) to promote phytoplankton diversity and suppress blooms; applying optimized culture may resolve planktonic algae problems in aquaculture ponds in Asia.					cai, miaoying/LTE-8105-2024; Sheng, Qiang/AAG-2548-2019	Tang, Qiongying/0000-0003-4214-673X; Sheng, Qiang/0000-0002-7385-0407; 													1355-557X	1365-2109				FEB 7	2023	2023								2781058	10.1155/2023/2781058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/2781058													WOS:000935371700007

The two altimeter-based CSL series agree well at interannual and longer time scales, but show significantly large discrepancies at seasonal and shorter time scales. The large discrepancies are found to be introduced by the approximately inverted barometer (IB) correction applied to the CMEMS SLA over the Caspian Sea. The IB correction over the Caspian Sea or any enclosed lakes needs to be treated separately from the ocean by using the correct reference mean pressure. The actual IB effects over the Caspian Sea are significantly smaller than those applied in the CMEMS SLA grids. After applying an improved IB correction using the global mean sea level pressure fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis atmospheric model, the two CSL series agree remarkably well. Altimeter observed CSL series show a significant decreasing trend on top of strong seasonal variations. The estimated linear trends for the Hydroweb and CMEMS CSL series are -5.37 +/- 0.11 and -5.40 +/- 0.11 cm/yr, respectively. Annual amplitudes are 17.03 +/- 1.33 vs. 15.79 +/- 1.30 cm, with nearly the same phases. The CSL change shows notable acceleration in the decreasing trend since around 2005, and the estimated trends have increased to -8.86 +/- 0.10 and -8.81 +/- 0.10 cm/yr, respectively for the two-altimeter CSL series.					; Chen, Jianli/KUD-8259-2024; Wang, Songyun/GZK-7412-2022; Li, Jin/H-5631-2019	Wang, Songyun/0000-0001-9305-8006; Cazenave, Anny/0000-0002-2289-1858; Chen, Jianli/0000-0001-5405-8441; Li, Jin/0000-0002-6927-0549; 														2072-4292				FEB	2023	15	3							703	10.3390/rs15030703	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15030703													WOS:000930873500001
J	Chen, T; Song, CQ; Zhan, PF; Fan, CY				Chen, Tan; Song, Chunqiao; Zhan, Pengfei; Fan, Chenyu			Densifying and Optimizing the Water Level Series for Large Lakes from Multi-Orbit ICESat-2 Observations	REMOTE SENSING												Satellite laser altimetry has been widely used for monitoring surface height changes in inland waters. However, constructing time series of water levels is partially limited in temporal resolution only based on the individual orbit of altimeter observations. To densify and optimize the time series of altimetry-based water levels is crucial to the scientific understanding of lake hydrologic dynamics. This paper focuses on synthesizing the multi-orbit on-lake observations from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) to densify and refine the water level time series for large lakes. The approach of synthesizing water level time series has been validated through experiments applied to 18 large lakes worldwide, resulting in an average R of 0.93, RMSE of 0.14 m, MAE of 0.12 m, NSE of 0.67, and CV of 2.86, according to the hydrologic gauge stations. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can provide an effective solution for densifying the water level series of large lakes covered by multi-orbit ICESat-2 observations. Further, the approach can be extended to monitor the high-frequency variation of other lakes covered by the multiple ICESat-2 orbits. This approach provides the potential of generating higher-frequency estimates of water levels based on satellite altimetry, which could not only help to reveal the characteristics of the seasonal dynamics of lakes but also be used to investigate the abrupt water level changes due to hydrological extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, etc.).

Estimation of Primary Production in the Water of the Coastal Zone of Lake Baikal Based on Daily Variations in CO2 Concentration in Different Seasons of 2005-2021	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												The gross and net primary production is estimated for the most characteristic seasonal life cycles of Baikal plankton based on long-term measurement series of carbon dioxide concentrations in the near-water atmosphere and surface and bottom water and "water-air" carbon dioxide fluxes. The calculations are carried out according to the scheme similar to the diel technique. With regard to the conditions of the coastal zone, the methodological issues are analyzed, neglect of which can lead to a significant uncertainty in these characteristics. We show that it is impossible to correctly estimate the net primary production only from CO2 concentration measurements in this technique. For periods of open water, the net primary production is calculated from the daily average CO2 flux. The estimates of the productivity for individual series of measurements in different periods quite adequately show the main features and are consistent with long-term observations.

This process theoretically changes the interaction and assembly pattern of microorganisms, which are important factors driving the structural and functional evolution of ecological communities in lakes. In this research, the community structure, interactions, and assembly of phytoplankton and bacteria were investigated during agro-irrigation seasons in a typical agricultural drainage receiving lake, Wuliangsuhai. The results showed that the seasonal variations in the community were driven by nitrogen and phosphorus. In particular, Cyanobacteria increased significantly during the seasons with the regulation of TP (lambda = 0.56, p < 0.01, n = 30). The TN positively drove Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta (lambda = 0.42 and 0.65, p < 0.05, n = 30). Furthermore, MENA showed that planktonic algae and bacterial community interactions were enhanced, and interspecific competition increased at high trophic levels. The community assembly is primarily a stochastic process that is mostly related to hydrodynamic conditions. The second related factor, nitrogen and phosphorus inputs, had obvious effects on community assembly, which responded to its effects on species diversity, niche width, and interactions, and they jointly controlled community assembly. This study reveals that the assembly processes of bacteria and planktonic algae were driven by different environmental factors in specific ways, which provides a new view for understanding agriculture's impacts on microecology and helps in developing lake protection strategies.

Behavioral and reproductive effects of the lampricides TFM and TFM:1% Niclosamide on native freshwater mussels	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lampricides TFM (3-trifluoromethyl-40-nitrophenol) and Niclosamide (NIC, 20, 5-dichloro-40-nitrosali cylanilide) are used to control sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes and associated tributaries. Niclosamide is often used as an additive to TFM to reduce the amount of TFM required to control sea lam-prey. Concern is growing over the risk that lampricide treatments pose to native freshwater mussels residing in streams. Our objectives were to determine the acute toxicity of TFM and TFM:NIC to free glo-chidia (removed from the marsupial gills), compare the relative toxicity of TFM and TFM:NIC between free glochidia and brooded glochidia (within the marsupial gills), determine if glochidia age influences toxicity, and assess if exposure of gravid mussels to TFM and TFM:NIC alters behavior and reproduction. Three acute toxicity tests (2:TFM, 1:TFM : NIC) were conducted with glochidia and adults of the plain pocketbook mussel (Lampsilis cardium). In tests with glochidia, viability did not differ across TFM and TFM : NIC concentrations that encompassed typical stream treatments. Glochidia age influenced toxicity as glochidia obtained later in the brooding season were less viable than glochidia obtained earlier in the brooding season. Exposure of adults to elevated concentrations of lampricides often resulted in behav-ioral effects, but rarely affected reproductive endpoints. Because mussels are long-lived (30 to 100 y), even intermittent and short duration exposures may cumulatively affect mussels over their lifetime. The risks posed by lampricide treatments in the Great Lakes would be further informed by research on the sublethal effects of lampricides, particularly effects on non-target organisms such as mussels.& COPY; 2022 The US Geological Survey and The Author(s).

Dependence of the Lipid and Unsaturated Fatty-Acid Compositions in Rainbow-Trout Skeletal Muscle on the Rearing Conditions and Physiological Status of Fish	APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND MICROBIOLOGY												A final product of fish production, the skeletal muscle of fish, is a source of animal protein, phospholipids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for human consumption. The effects of rearing conditions (seasonal temperature and oxygen regimens) and physiological state (infectious status) on the lipid composition of the skeletal muscle of two-year-old rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss grown in cages on a natural lake were studied. It was detected that the rate of body growth in trout juveniles decreased with increased water temperature, sporadic bacterial infection, and subsequent antimicrobial therapy. In addition, an excessive accumulation of reserve lipids (triacylglycerols) and increased saturation of the membrane lipids in fish muscle were shown. Dietary supplementation with an antioxidant additive including dihydroquercetin and arabinogalactan was used to mitigate the impact of exogenous factors and bacterial infection. It was shown that the lipid composition and unsaturated fatty-acid content were more stable with supplement-feeding of the fish tissue, which indicates better consumption characteristics and a balanced nutrient composition of the resulting fish product.

Studied lakes represented three types, classified according to the concept of Alternative Stable States as: macrophyte dominated MD (dense vegetation), phytoplankton-macrophyte dominated PMD (sparse, patchy vegetation) and phytoplankton dominated PD (lack of submerged vegetation). Both zoocenosis responded differently to the changes in macrophyte cover. The density and biomass of benthic midges (density and biomass per m(2) of bottom surface) were visibly higher in the patchy vegetated lakes; the abundance of epiphytic chironomids did not show any regularity. The species composition of epiphytic chironomids differed visibly between particular lake types, changed with the decrease of macrophyte cover. The composition of benthic midges was similar in A lake types. The studies showed a strong dependence of the proportion of epiphytic to benthic chironomids on the cover of macrophytes. In MD lakes the phytophilous midges were more abundant than benthic; in PMD lakes we observed the opposite pattern.					; Kornijów, Ryszard/AEX-3635-2022; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/T-7469-2018	Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/0000-0001-5328-6944; 													1505-2249						2008	56	4					569	579																WOS:000262099800002

Seasonal dynamics of Daphnia laevis Birge, 1878 ephippia in a tropical lake with a description of a new methodology for in situ evaluation	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The effect of dormancy in zooplankton populations is still unknown, largely because of the lack of methods to estimate hatching and production of the dormant stages. This study aimed to compare the production and hatching rates of ephippia of Daphnia laevis between thermal stratification and mixing periods in Jacare Lake (Middle Rio Doce, Minas Gerais, Brazil). For this, we collected ephippia on the sediment with core sampler and we created a device called the "Ephippial Collector". There was a significant difference in ephippia hatching in situ between stratification and mixing periods (Pearson's Chi-squared test p <0.001), being higher in the second one. Significant differences in the hatching rates between periods was observed in the laboratory only for ephippia collected with Ephippial Collectors (Pearson's Chi-squared test p <0.001), being higher during the mixing period (similar to 8%). The core sample allows the collection of a certain fraction of the sediment that may contain a mixture of ephippia produced in different periods, i.e., may contain old and not viable ephippia, which masks the hatching rate. Thus, seasonality in hatching rates of ephippia was reported only by Ephippial Collectors. The higher hatching rate observed during the mixing period in the lake suggests that individuals hatched from ephippia may contribute to the increase in the population of D. laevis in the water column at this time.

Sediment plays a key role in organic matter (OM) and internal nutrient cycling in lakes. The role of sediment as a source of OM and its potential bottom-up effects on the pelagic food web have rarely been studied. Particularly, the influence of the biochemical composition of sediment OM on pelagic compartments remains largely unknown. 2. During a 5-month experiment, we studied the influence of two different sediments added at the bottom of large replicated mesocosms on the biomass of seston and zooplankton, and their elemental and lipid compositions. The influence of sediment treatments on sedimentation rates, elemental and biochemical compositions and potential biodegradability of recently sedimented OM (c. 1 week) was also examined. 3. The two added sediments (S-1 and S-2) presented contrasting elemental and biochemical compositions and potential biodegradabilities. According to their contents of organic carbon, nitrogen, proteins, sugars and polyunsaturated fatty acids, S-2 appeared to be much more biodegradable than S-1. Therefore, the S-2 sediment was expected to release more nutrients and OM to the water column than S-1, leading to changes in communities, stoichiometry and lipid compositions of pelagic compartments. 4. Probably due to its very poor content of labile compounds, the presence of S-1 at the bottom of the mesocosms did not induce changes in the biomass of seston and zooplankton. Only few changes in the stoichiometry of these compartments were observed. In contrast, S-2 sediment released more phosphorus and dissolved OM into the water column than S-1. As a result, the S-2 treatment induced an increase in seston biomass and therefore in zooplankton biomass via herbivory. 5. None of the sediment treatments affected the lipid composition of seston and zooplankton. Moreover, neither S-1 nor S-2 induced changes in the sedimentation rates, elemental and lipid compositions, and potential biodegradability of recent sediments. Our mesocosm experiment suggests that differences in the quality of lake sediments lead to moderate changes in the pelagic communities in the absence of planktivorous or omnivorous fish. 6. Our results could partly explain the efficiency of biomanipulation for improving water quality of eutrophic lakes despite potential nutrient release from sediment.					gauzens, benoit/ITU-7854-2023														0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2014	59	8					1695	1709		10.1111/fwb.12375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12375													WOS:000339385100011

Vertical and temporal variation in phytoplankton assemblages correlated with environmental conditions in the Mundau reservoir, semi-arid northeastern Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The goal of this study was to analyse the vertical structure of the phytoplankton community at the Mundau reservoir, located in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil, and to correlate it to environmental conditions over two distinct seasons, dry and rainy. Samples were collected bimonthly at eight depths in the dry and rainy season for analyses of the physical and chemical variables of the water, as well as density, abundance, dominance, species diversity index and equitability of the community. Analysis of variance (ANOVA-two way) was used to analyse the vertical and seasonal differences, and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to assess associations between phytoplankton and environmental variables Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenaya and Subba Raju was the only dominant species and Geitlerinema amphibium (C. Agardh) Anagnostidis, Merismopedia punctata Meyen and Synedra rumpens Kutzing. Others six taxa were abundant in at least one of the samples. Distinct vertical distribution patterns were observed for the abundant taxa between depths and seasons. The cyanobacteria, with the exception of C. raciborskii, showed similar seasonal patterns, with higher densities in the dry season. The CCA showed a strong correlation between the density of the phytoplanktonic species and abiotic variables. The vertical changes in abundant taxa revealed distinct patterns regulated by the variation in the environmental factors that were directly linked to seasonality, with the success of one or more species being dependent on their life strategies and ecological needs. The present study restates the importance of environmental and seasonal factors for phytoplankton composition and distribution in a freshwater tropical reservoir through a vertical gradient.

Environmental variables, namely temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, chlorophyll-A and transparency, were measured using a multi-parameter probe and a Secchi disk. Measurements of environmental variables were performed at 0.1 m intervals from the surface to the bottom of the lake during the dry and wet seasons. High water level and strong solar radiation increased temperature stratification. River discharges during the wet season, and unsustainable sand mining activities led to an increased turbidity exceeding 100 NTU, and reduced transparency, which changed the temperature variation and subsequently altered the water quality pattern.

Precipitation and wind regimes constitute important environmental drivers of ecosystem functioning, which partially compensate for the weak tidal-forcing that is characteristic of the Caribbean Sea. Seasonal peaks in temperature and precipitation were strongly correlated to the reproduction of marine, catadromous and estuarine fish species, suggesting that the ensuing increase in primary production provides larval fish with an abundant food source. Increased abundances of transient marine species were observed during the dry season, which may be explained by passive transport, feeding migration, or both, considering that prey may be more abundant inshore and that environmental conditions are dominated by higher salinity and stronger onshore winds during this period. Despite being a stopover site for many long-range migrating shorebird species, the Bay serves primarily as a resting place since it lacks extensive tides and tidal flats, and thus provides limited access to invertebrate prey. Furthermore, this sheltered environment, featuring abundant freshwater, seasonally high water clarity, and low tidal amplitude, is likely to provide good habitat for abundant seagrasses and manatees. The Lake Izabal-Amatique Bay complex demonstrates a wide range of teleconnections and connectivity among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine oceanic and reef ecosystems. Understanding the evolution and ecology underlying this highly connected system is required for the management of the multi-trophic, small-scale fisheries it sustains.

J	Wienburg, CL; Shore, RF				Wienburg, CL; Shore, RF			Factors influencing liver PCB concentrations in sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and herons (Ardea cinerea) in Britain	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Large scale temporal and spatial changes in the exposure of terrestrial vertebrates to PCBs have been monitored in the UK by measuring liver residues in sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and grey herons (Ardea cinerea) from throughout the country. Residues in the three species are typically characterised by large intra- and inter-specific variation. Data for 306 sparrowhawks, 186 kestrels and 47 herons collected between 1992 and 1997 as part of a national Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme were examined to determine how much of this variation was explained by body condition, age and sex, rather than other factors. In all three species, body condition was the single most important factor and accounted for up to 49% of the variation in PCB liver residues; starved birds had the highest liver concentrations. Age and sex were also significant but of lesser importance. Adult sparrowhawks and kestrels had liver PCB residues that were 2 to 10-fold higher than in first-year birds. Sex did not affect residue magnitude in a consistent manner. PCB concentrations in the liver were higher in males than females in both first-year and adult kestrels and in first-year sparrowhawks, but adult female sparrowhawks had similar PCB residues to adult males. Liver residues also varied seasonally. PCB concentrations in first-year sparrowhawks increased during the first year following fledging and a similar pattern was detected in adult female sparrowhawks following egg laying. When these physiological factors were taken into account, it was evident that while kestrels with high fat scores had significantly lower PCB concentrations than either sparrowhawks or herons, liver residues were similar in all three species when birds were in a starved condition. Overall during 1992-1997, the combined influence of body condition, age and sex explained more of the variation in liver PCB concentrations than species differences or other factors, such as geographical variation in exposure.

J	De Lurio, JL; Frakes, LA				De Lurio, JL; Frakes, LA			Glendonites as a paleoenvironmental tool: Implications for early Cretaceous high latitude climates in Australia	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Glendonites, calcite pseudomorphs after the metastable mineral ikaite (CaCO3. 6H(2)O), occur in the Late Aptian interval of the Bulldog Shale in the Eromanga Basin, Australia and in other Early Cretaceous basins at high paleolatitudes. Ikaite precipitation in the marine environment requires near-freezing temperatures (not higher than 4 degrees C), high alkalinity, increased levels of orthophosphate, and high P-CO2. The rapid and complete transformation of ikaite to calcite at temperatures between 5 and 8 degrees C provides an upper limit on the oxygen isotopic composition of the pore waters: -2.6 < delta(2) < -3.4 parts per thousand SMOW. If it is assumed that these pore waters are representative of the shallow Eromanga Basin, the calculated delta(w) can be used to reassess belemnite fossil oxygen isotopic paleotemperatures-temperature recorded by fauna living in the basin at the time of ikaite precipitation. Data previously reported as 11 to 16 degrees C (assuming delta(w) = 0.0 parts per thousand SMOW) yield paleotemperatures ranging from -1 to 5 degrees C, squarely in the range of ikaite stability. The low delta(w) indicates hyposaline conditions, most likely caused by mixing high latitude meteoric waters with seawater. The O-18 depleted, low temperature waters suggest that the region was at least seasonally colder than previously accepted.

Sant			Microbiological quality of irrigation water collected from vegetable farms in Sao Paulo, Brazil during the dry and rainy season	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Irrigation water samples were collected from 69 farms in Sao Paulo during two rainy seasons and one dry season. Levels of culturable microorganisms were analyzed using direct plating technique, while levels of E. coli, Enterococci and Clostridium perfringens were determined using membrane filtration. Agroecosystem features including the incidence of manure stockpile, manure lagoon and livestock grazing, amongst others were observed and recorded. In the study area, groundwater (33%) was the most commonly exploited water resource for irrigating vegetables, while the least utilized resources were potable water (4%), streams (2%), lakes (2%) and domestic wastewater (2%). Other water resources exploited for irrigation in the area were farm ponds (21%), harvested rainwater (15%), canals (10%) and rivers (5%). The microbiological quality of water used to irrigate vegetables in the study area was variable depending on factors including source and treatment (chlorination) applied. The levels of culturable microorganisms recovered from the samples ranged between 11.0 and 1.7 log CFU/mL during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively, while the levels of E. coli, Enterococci and Clostridium perfringens detected in irrigation water samples were in the range of 0-6, 0 - 6.5, and 0 - 5.8 log CFU/100 mL, respectively. Irrigation water collected from farms that utilize surface waters such as canals and farm ponds generally contained higher levels of bacteria. In general, bacterial contamination varied among sources in the following order: surface water > groundwater > municipal water. Levels of bacteria detected in groundwater were comparatively low and in about 60% of the cases, for groundwater, no seasonal fluctuation in levels was observed. At the farms where seasonal fluctuations were observed for the levels of bacteria however, at least one potential source of fecal bacteria such as the presence of manure stockpile or livestock grazing was identified.

J	Koschorreck, M; Tittel, J				Koschorreck, Matthias; Tittel, Joerg			Natural alkalinity generation in neutral lakes affected by acid mine drainage	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Lakes in surface mining areas are often subject to continuous loads of acid mine drainage. The knowledge of internal alkalinity generation in a lake is necessary to predict if the lake will stay circumneutral or may acidify. The most important processes of alkalinity production in lakes are sulfate reduction, denitrification, and the burial of N in the sediment. By summarizing data from the literature, we present probable rates of these different processes in circumneutral mining lakes. The critical acidity load that can probably be compensated for by internal processes, is 5.09 mmol(-) m(-2) d(-1) in productive lakes and 0.50 mmol(-) m(-2) d(-1) in less productive lakes. Under the assumption that methanogenesis is inhibited by high sulfate concentrations, the highest probable acidity loads in such lakes are 6.85 mmol(-) m(-2) d(-1) and 1.06 mmol(-) m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Denitrification, sulfate reduction, and N burial contributed significantly to total alkalinity production. Sulfate reduction had the largest potential. However, existing models cannot predict alkalinity generation from sulfate concentrations alone because the long-term stability of reduced S compounds in the sediment is crucial for a sustainable biological alkalinity generation. The larger acid-neutralizing potential of higher trophic lakes is caused both by higher rates of microbial activity and by a greater stability of reduced reaction products in the sediment. The largest uncertainties in our knowledge with respect to the total alkalinity budget are related to microbial processes in sulfate-rich freshwater lakes and the long-term stability of reduced reaction products in the sediment.

J	Roulet, M; Guimaraes, JRD; Lucotte, M				Roulet, M; Guimaraes, JRD; Lucotte, M			Methylmercury production and accumulation in sediments and soils of an amazonian floodplain - Effect of seasonal inundation	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This study investigated the spatial and seasonal variations of MeHg concentrations and burdens of different sediments and soils of the Tapajos river floodplain, one of the major clear-water tributaries of the Amazon. The small floodplain of the Tapajos is typical of Amazonian floodplain ecosystems. The studied lakes are bordered by inundated forest (igapo), while floating macrophyte mats (Paspalum sp.) develop at the margin of lakes during the flooded season. During the flood, we observed very low MeHg concentrations in the open water lake sediments (<0.5 ng g(-1) d.w or <0.5 mug m(-2) cm(-1) d.w.) as compared to the semi-aquatic sediments of the macrophyte zone (0.2-1.4 ng g(-1) d.w or 1-3 mug m(-2) cm(-1) d.w.) and the igapo semi-terrestrial soils (0.2-3 ng g(-1) d.w or 2-12 mug m(-2) cm(-1) d.w.). The litter horizon from the igapo soils showed the highest value of MeHg (4-8 ng g(-1) d.w.) representing 0.2-2 mug m(-2) cm(-1) d.w. at the sediment/water interface during the aquatic phase. The inundation had no effect on the concentrations and burdens of MeHg in the sediment of the central part of the lake. The inundation had a clear effect on the methylation of Hg at the surface of semi-aquatic shoreline sediments (macrophyte zone) and semi-terrestrial forest soils, where MeHg concentrations and burdens appeared to be 3 times greater following inundation. In all cores, total Hg concentrations follow those of Fe and Al oxy-hydroxides, whereas the MeHg concentrations are linked to organic matter quality and quantity. It is suggested that organic matter and inundation control MeHg production and accumulation at the benthic interface. These results confirm previous observations, in the same study area, of net Hg-203 methylation potentials. The fresh and labile organic matter in the litter of the igapo forest appears as the most important factor leading to significant enrichment of MeHg in these particular terrestrial/aquatic sedimentary environments.					; Guimaraes, Jean/B-6451-2013	Lucotte, Marc/0000-0002-6360-2979; 													0049-6979					MAY	2001	128	1-2					41	60		10.1023/A:1010379103335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010379103335													WOS:000167945300004

Lakes and reservoirs are particularly vulnerable to pressure on water quality owing to long residence times compared with rivers. This has raised the question of how to determine and to quantify the sources of priority chemicals (e.g. nutrients, persistent organic pollutants and metals) so that suitable measures can be taken to address failures to comply with regulatory standards. Contaminants enter lakes waters from a range of diffuse and point sources. Decision support tools and models are essential to assess the relative magnitudes of these sources and to estimate the impacts of any programmes of measures. This paper describes the development and testing of the Source Apportionment Geographical Information System (SAGIS) for future management of 763 lakes in England and Wales. The model uses readily available national data sets to estimate contributions of a number of key chemicals including nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), metals (copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury and nickel) and organic chemicals (Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons) from multiple sector sources. Lake-specific sources are included (groundbait from angling and bird faeces) and hydrology associated with pumped inputs and abstraction. Validation data confirms the efficacy of the model to successfully predicted seasonal patterns of all types of contaminant concentrations under a number of hydrological scenarios. Such a tool has not been available on a national scale previously for such a wide range of chemicals and is currently being used to assist with future river basin planning. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although quantification of ground-water nitrate loading to streams is common, the dependence of surface water silicon ( Si) and phosphorus (P) concentrations on groundwater sources has rarely been determined. Additionally, the ability of groundwater discharge to drive surface water Si:P ratios has not been contextualized relative to riverine inputs or in-stream transformations. In this study, we quantify the seasonal dynamics of Si and P cycles in the Grand River (GR) watershed, the largest Canadian watershed draining into Lake Erie, to test our hypothesis that regions of Si-rich groundwater discharge increase surface water Si:P ratios. Historically, both the GR and Lake Erie have been considered stoichiometrically P-limited, where the molar Si:P ratio is greater than the similar to 16:1 phytoplankton uptake ratio. However, recent trends suggest that eastern Lake Erie may be approaching Si-limitation. We sampled groundwater and surface water for dissolved and reactive particulate Si as well as total dissolved P for 12 months within and downstream of a 50-km reach of high groundwater discharge. Our results indicate that groundwater Si:P ratios are lower than the corresponding surface water and that groundwater is a significant source of bioavailable P to surface water. Despite these observations, the watershed remains P-limited for the majority of the year, with localized periods of Si-limitation. We further find that groundwater Si:P ratios are a relatively minor driver of surface water Si:P, but that the magnitude of Si and P loads from groundwater represent a large proportion of the overall fluxes to Lake Erie.

Composition and Content of Fatty Acids in the Tissues of Males and Females of Eurasian Perch Perca fluviatilis at the Late Stages of Reproductive Cycle	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												We have studied the composition and content of fatty acids (FAs) in the muscle, liver, and reproductive tissues of male and female of Eurasian perch from the Krasnoyarsk water reservoir at the late stages of reproductive cycle. The dynamics of FA composition of the muscle tissue correlates with seasonal changes in food-source composition, while the FA composition of the liver and gonad is influenced by the reproductive cycle and differs between males and females. Multivariate analysis shows that the redistribution of FAs at different stages of the reproductive cycle involves mainly the gonads and liver tissue. The nutritive value of the muscle tissue of perch, as a source of long-chain polyunsaturated FAs, does not depend on the reproductive stage.					; Yablokov, Nikita/U-1840-2019; Rudchenko, Anastasia/U-8036-2017	Yablokov, Nikita/0000-0002-5420-8259; Rudchenko, Anastasia/0000-0001-7114-160X													1995-4255	1995-4263				MAY	2018	11	3					309	319		10.1134/S1995425518030101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425518030101													WOS:000436923300006

Modeling system for predicting enterococci levels at Holly Beach	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This paper presents a new modeling system for nowcasting and forecasting enterococci levels in coastal recreation waters at any time during the day. The modeling system consists of (1) an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting the enterococci level at sunrise time, (2) a clear-sky solar radiation and turbidity correction to the ANN model, (3) remote sensing algorithms for turbidity, and (4) nowcasting/forecasting data. The first three components are also unique features of the new modeling system. While the component (1) is useful to beach monitoring programs requiring enterococci levels in early morning, the component (2) in combination with the component (1) makes it possible to predict the bacterial level in beach waters at any time during the day if the data from the components (3) and (4) are available. Therefore, predictions from the component (2) are of primary interest to beachgoers. The modeling system was developed using three years of swimming season data and validated using additional four years of independent data. Testing results showed that (1) the sunrise-time model correctly reproduced 82.63% of the advisories issued in seven years with a false positive rate of 2.65% and a false negative rate of 14.72%, and (2) the new modeling system was capable of predicting the temporal variability in enterococci levels in beach waters, ranging from hourly changes to daily cycles. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the new modeling system in predicting enterococci levels in coastal beach waters. Applications of the modeling system will improve the management of recreational beaches and protection of public health. (C) Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rocha, MR; Vasseur, DA; Gaedke, U				Rocha, Marcia R.; Vasseur, David A.; Gaedke, Ursula			Seasonal Variations Alter the Impact of Functional Traits on Plankton Dynamics	PLOS ONE												Gaining understanding of food-web processes often requires a simplified representation of natural diversity. One such simplification can be based on functional traits, as functionally similar species may provide a similar contribution to ecosystem level-processes. However, understanding how similarity in functional traits actually translates into similar contributions to ecosystem-level properties remains a challenge due to the complex ways in which traits can influence species' dynamics. Moreover, in many communities, seasonality alters the abiotic and biotic forcing regime, causing ongoing changes to patterns of species' dominance; groups of species do not stay intact but are rather continuously subjected to changes throughout the year. Using long-term high frequency measurements of phytoplankton in Lake Constance, we investigated the effect of seasonal changes on the relationship between functional similarity and temporal dynamics similarity of 36 morphotypes, and the relative contribution of different functional traits during the different parts of the year. Our results revealed seasonal differences in the overall degree of synchronization of morphotypes' temporal dynamics and how combinations of functional traits influence the relationship between functional trait similarity and temporal dynamics similarity, showing that different forcing regimes change how species cope with their environment based on their functional traits. Moreover, we show that the individual functional traits matter at different periods of the year indicating that species which are dynamically similar at certain parts of the year may not be at others. The differential strength of the overall and individual impact of functional traits on species' temporal dynamics makes the cohesion of a pair of functionally similar species dependent on the different forcing. Hence, simplifying food webs based solely on functional traits may not provide consistent estimates of functional groups over all seasons.					; Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013	Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613; 													1932-6203					DEC 12	2012	7	12							e51257	10.1371/journal.pone.0051257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051257								23300539					WOS:000313236200077
J	Lydersen, E; Löfgren, S; Arnesen, RT				Lydersen, E; Löfgren, S; Arnesen, RT			Metals in Scandinavian surface waters:: Effects of acidification, liming, and potential reacidification	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This article is a state-of-the-art review about such metals as Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Hg, and As in surface waters. It focuses on natural and anthropogenic sources, chemical properties and levels, and toxicity mechanisms of these metals to aquatic organisms, primarily fish and invertebrates. Organisms living in almost anoxic, sulfide-rich evironments are not incorporated into this study. This information is then linked to a Nordic Lake Survey implemented in 1995 on major chemistry and metals in Scandinavian surface waters to scale the problems of metals in Swedish and Norwegian surface waters. Because many acidified Swedish and Norwegian lakes also are limed, we also assess the risk of remobilization of metals because these waters reacidify due to reduced liming activity. The concentrations and chemical properties of metals in lakes relative to the biological effect levels suggest that the potential risks associated to both current and potential reacidified status of limed waters decreases in the order Al much greater than Cd > Pb in Swedish and Norwegian lakes. Also Hg, because of the organometallic forms such as methylmercury (MeHg), might be of concern, because it biomagnifies in the food chain and subsequently of great importance for top predators, including human beings. However, other factors than pH, such as changes in organic matter load from the surrounding soils due to natural climatic variations, are much more important for the Hg load and thereby the Hg concentrations in lakes than pH. The risks associated with other metals such as Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn are very low and have to be considered only occasionally, because high concentrations are very rare in Norwegian and Swedish lakes. Less than 2% of the lakes have concentrations greater than or equal to the lowest biological risk levels quoted in the two countries. Because primarily As is present as anions in surface waters, this element differs significantly from the cationic metals. Only a few lakes have high As concentration in relation to critical levels in Sweden, and high As concentrations are mainly related to agricultural areas and consequently high pH waters.

Species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, H') were measured at two week intervals at one collection site. Indices were calculated on an individual, cell and biomass basis. Because of the relative importance of colonial species in this reservoir, calculations based on biomass were the best descriptors for the studied environment. Climatic changes, especially rainfall, were important to explain the seasonal variation observed, acting as a possible disturbing factor and improving diversity. The calculation of diversity indices was important to demonstrate the instability of this system, which for most of the year does not allow the dominance of a single species, and showed high H' values.					; Figueredo, Cleber/J-7901-2013; Giani, Alessandra/H-9764-2012	Figueredo, Cleber/0000-0002-6248-1327; Giani, Alessandra/0000-0002-2524-8534													0018-8158	1573-5117					2001	445	1-3					165	174		10.1023/A:1017513731393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017513731393													WOS:000169330700016

The first stage of the study includes evaluation of the multitemporal climatic data on the Salt Lake Basin Area, Turkey for a period of 35 years (1970-2005). The changes in mean temperature and precipitation are evaluated for the study area by comparing two periods, 1970-1992 and 1993-2005. In the second stage, the effects of climate changes in the Salt Lake are investigated by evaluating water and salt reserve changes through seasonal and multitemporal SPOT imagery collected in 1987 and 2005. The climatic data and remotely sensed and treated satellite images show that water and salt reserve in Salt Lake has decreased between 1987 and 2005 due to drought and uncontrolled water usage. It is suggested that the use of water supplies, especially underground waters, around the Salt Lake should be controlled and the lake should regularly be monitored by current remote sensing data for an effective management of water and salt resources in the region.

Seasonal effects of prescribed burning and roller chopping on saw palmetto in flatwoods	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Shrub encroachment has become a problem in many rangeland systems across the United States due to a reduction in the disturbances, primarily fire, which historically maintained them. The shrub saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) has become abundant in many habitats of the southeastern Coastal Plain, including Florida. When fire regimes are altered or fires are suppressed, this species can proliferate leading to significant changes in the ecosystem, particularly the herbaceous vegetation. Prescribed burning and roller chopping are management activities often used to control saw palmetto. However, little is known about the effects these treatments have on this shrub, particularly when applied in different seasons. We compared the seasonal effects of prescribed burning, roller chopping, and combinations of the two on saw palmetto. The effects of treatments on saw palmetto were assessed using a paired-sample approach, where saw palmetto height, cover, and density were compared between sampling locations randomly located within treated (e.g., burned) and untreated areas. Dormant season burning had no effect on saw palmetto density and height and only temporarily reduced cover, with rapid regrowth occurring the first year post-treatment. Growing season burning also had no effect on saw palmetto density. However, saw palmetto cover was lower on growing season burn compared to control sites the first year post-treatment and height the first and second year post-treatment. The combination of burning and roller chopping, despite having no effect on saw palmetto density, did result in lower saw palmetto height compared to controls the first and second year post-treatment. The effect of roller chopping/burning on saw palmetto cover depended on season and year. Saw palmetto cover and height were lower on dormant and growing season roller chop than control sites the first and second year post-treatment, but only growing season roller chopping had an effect on saw palmetto density. The single application of a dormant or growing season burn is not recommended for control of high-density saw palmetto, however, it may be suitable to maintain areas where saw palmetto levels are low and proliferation of the species is not a threat. Dormant and growing season roller chopping showed the greatest potential for rapid saw palmetto control. Growing season roller chopping is recommended if significant reductions in saw palmetto density are desired. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Theoretically, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) could signal in-situ anaerobic microbial activities in shallow lakes. Here we test this theory by analyzing GDGTs of sediment samples collected in Lake Wuliangsu, a typical large and shallow lake located in the Yellow River Reaches. Considering that lake surface sediments show different occurrences and distribution patterns with lake shore and riverine sediments, brGDGTs and GDGT-0 should be mainly produced by heterotrophic anaerobic bacteria (Acidobacteria) and methanogenic archaea (Euryarchaeota) within the lake, while crenarchaeol from soil OC transported through the Yellow River system. With the assistant of a two end-member model, in-situ and soil-derived brGDGTs can be quantitatively evaluated. Following these discoveries, we further utilized GDGT-based records from a well-dated sedimentary core to disentangle the past similar to 180-year history of anaerobic microbial activities in Lake Wuliangsu. The in-situ anaerobic microbial activities started to increase at CE 1926 and showed stronger predominance over soil-derived tetraether lipids after CE 1954, largely due to a combined effect from hydrological change and in-situ OC production resulting in OC-rich and anaerobic conditions for heterotrophic anaerobic microorganisms to prosperous. However, the relative contribution of in-situ anaerobic microbial GDGTs to overall sedimentary OC shows complex relations with both OC production and recycling behaviors, tentatively suggesting that anaerobic microbial activities only conduct a minor impact on OC burial in the shallow and eutrophic Lake Wuliangsu over the Anthropocene.

J	Garrido, AC				Garrido, Alberto C.			Paleoenvironment of the Auca Mahuevo and Los Barreales sauropod nesting-sites (Late Cretaceous, Neuquen Province, Argentina)	AMEGHINIANA												Outcrops of Anacleto Formation at Auca Mahuevo nesting site (Neuquen Province, Argentina) can be divided into two main sections. The lower section (51 m), exhibits a succession of point bar, levee, crevasse channel and crevasse splay deposits, typifing a fine-grained, mixed load, meandering fluvial system. Twenty five km toward south (Los Barreales locality) these deposits become progressively to distal floodplain facies. Egg-layers are exposed along this 25 km, however a higher concentration of egg-clutches occur into paleosols and abandoned channel deposits developed at ancient levee and meander belt areas. Lithofacial evidences allow attributing for this lower section semiarid climatic condition, with marked alternations of wet and dry seasons. Exceptional muddy sheet-floods burying the eggs and nests with a thick bed of mud, facilitating their preservation. The upper section (17 m), is composed by finer sediments of sloughs and lacustrine deposits developed over a poorly drained floodplain, under conditions of major aridity. South toward Los Barreales, evaporitic deposits was formed in saline-lakes. The tectonic and volcanic processes that affected the basin from the middle to upper Campanian were responsible for the variations in the environmental conditions during the latest phase of the Anacleto Formation deposition. Possibly, these changes provoked the abandonment of this area as nesting-ground.																			0002-7014					MAR 30	2010	47	1					99	106		10.5710/AMGH.v47i1.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.5710/AMGH.v47i1.8													WOS:000278752100007

Multi-temporal SPOT satellite images coupled with a self-organizing map neural network, terrain analysis, Universal Soil Loss Equation, and landscape patch indicators were used to assess eco -environmental changes of the denudation sites, such as changes of the post-quake landslide, terrain displacement, soil erosion, and landscape ecology. The extracted area soon after the earthquake was 215.68ha. From 1999 through 2006, the denudation area declined to 113.36ha, which indicates that about 47.44% of the landslide has been restored. Based on terrain analysis for the denudation sites, the debris volumes at the collapsed and deposited areas are 31,896,667 M3 and 39,537,067 m3, respectively. The large amount of debris blocked two streams, the Satsikenghsi and the Chiutsaihuhsi, to form two landslide -dammed lakes. The annual erosion depth soon after the earthquake reached 22.07 mm, about 3.59 times as high as pre-quake. Without vegetation cover on the topsoil, the denudation sites became high-erosion areas during subsequent typhoon seasons. However, with landslide restoration, annual soil erosion depth prediction has reduced to 13.54mm, about 2.21 times as high as pre-quake. In addition, the assessment of landscape patch indicators also points out the heterogeneity and the degree of richness of the landscape due to vegetation recovery at the landslide area. The analyzed results show that nature itself has a robust ability to restore its original landscape and mitigate disaster impacts for the destroyed eco -environment. @ 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.																			0925-8574	1872-6992				JUL 3	2008	33	3-4					220	232		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2008.04.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2008.04.002													WOS:000258218200003
J	Driese, SG; Ashley, GM; Li, ZH; Hover, VC; Owen, RB				Driese, SG; Ashley, GM; Li, ZH; Hover, VC; Owen, RB			Possible Late Holocene equatorial palaeoclimate record based upon soils spanning the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, Loboi Plain, Kenya	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Wetland and floodplain soils in the East African Rift of Kenya provide a record of changing palaeoclimate and palaeohydrology compatible with climate records for the mid-Holocene through the late Holocene Medieval Warm Period (similar toAD 800-1270) and Little Ice Age (similar toAD 1270-1850), documented previously in nearby lacustrine sites. Soils forming from volcaniclastie source materials in both Loboi Swamp and laterally adjacent Kesubo Marsh, two wetland systems of latest Holocene age, were investigated using micromorphology, whole-soil geochemical analysis, and stable isotope analysis of soil organic matter (SOM). Wetland formation was abrupt and possibly related to climate shift from drier conditions associated with the mid-Holocene and Medieval Warm Period, to wetter conditions associated with the Little Ice Age. Pre-wetland sediments are floodplain volcanic sandy silts comprising buried Inceptisols (SOM delta(13)C=-15parts per thousand PDB) that fine upward to fine silt and clay, which are overlain by clays and organic-rich sediment (peat) (SOM delta(13)C=-26parts per thousand PDB). Stable isotopes record an abrupt shift from 20 to 40% C3 vegetation (scrubland mixture of warm-season grasses and Acacia) to 100% C3 (wetland dominated by Typha) that occurred about 680+/-40 years BP (C-14 date from seeds). Soils developed on the periphery of the wetland show evidence for fluctuations in hydrologic budget, including siderite and redoximorphic features formed during wetter phases, and vertic (shrink-swell) and clay illuviation features developed during drier phases. Soils at Kesubo Marsh, located 2-3 km east of Loboi Swamp, consist of two buried mid-Holocene, 4000-4600 years BP (two C-14 dates from bulk SOM) Inceptisols developed from fluvially derived volcanic sand (SOM delta(13)C=-15parts per thousand PDB) and separated from the latest Holocene surface soil (SOM delta(13)C= -17.5parts per thousand PDB) by an unconformity and prominent stone line. Both the Loboi Swamp and Kesubo Marsh surface soils show increases in Zr, Fe, and S relative to buried soils, as well as higher leaching indices. Elevated Zr may reflect zircon grain inputs by either aeolian dust (during drier climate conditions) or fluvial sheetflood inputs, whereas higher leaching and elevated Fe and S represent pyritization associated with wetter conditions.

Many of these oligotrophic systems are connected superficially to wetlands during the wet season. We describe the fish community structure in 4 cenotes during the rainy and dry seasons over a 4-year period and relate it to limnetic dynamics in each cenote. We sampled cenotes to describe morphology, water physicochemical characteristics, primary production, and invertebrates and fish abundance and richness. We did not find differences in physicochemical variables between seasons but we did find differences among years and among cenotes. We found 11 fish species (25% of the total richness reported for the Biosphere Reserve of Sian Ka'an) from 5 families: Cichlidae, Poeciliidae, Characidae, Pimelodidae and Synbranchidae. We noted little seasonal or inter-annual variation of fish species richness. But there were higher differences of fish species richness and abundances among cenotes. Fish community structure was correlated with temperature, transparency, pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, periphyton and zooplankton abundance. Results showed that physicochemical variables and fish community structure are not affected by seasonal hydrology dynamics, suggesting that cenotes are stable aquatic systems compared to the surrounding wetlands. Other limnetic factors such as cenote morphology are also related to fish community structure.

Samples were collected seasonally (April, June, September and November). A Ponto-Caspian element, quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov 1897), was found for the first time in the Serbian Danube stretch in April 2010 at sampling site Veliko Gradiste (1059 r-km). Our furthest upstream finding of this species was at site Ram (1071 r-km). Species identification was done by the morphology of its shells. In addition, a comparison with another dreissenid species Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas 1771) was made based on shell morphology. Population density of quagga mussel was low, with the ratio of D. polymorpha to D. rostriformis bugensis being around 5:1. The finding of D. rostriformis bugensis in the Serbian Danube stretch is evidence that this invasive Ponto-Caspian species moved the limit of its distribution upstream in the Danube River which is one of the main corridors used for its spread from Eastern (Romania, Bulgaria) to Western Europe.

Natural and anthropogenic lead in sediments of the Rotorua lakes, New Zealand	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Global atmospheric sources of lead have increased more than 100-fold over the past century as a result of deforestation, coal combustion, ore smelting and leaded petroleum. Lead compounds generally accumulate in depositional areas across the globe where, due to low solubility and relative freedom from microbial degradation, the history of their inputs is preserved. In lakes there is rapid deposition and often little bioturbation of lead, resulting in an excellent depositional history of changes in both natural and anthropogenic sources. The objective of this study was to use sediments from a regionally bounded set of lakes to provide an indication of the rates of environmental inputs of lead whilst taking into account differences of trophic state and lead exposure between lakes. Intact sediment gravity cores were collected from 13 Rotorua lakes in North Island of New Zealand between March 2006 and January 2007. Cores penetrated sediments to a depth of 16-30 cm and contained volcanic tephra from the 1886 AD Tarawera eruption. The upper depth of the Tarawera tephra enabled prescription of a date for the associated depth in the core (120 years). Each core showed a sub-surface peak in lead concentration above the Tarawera tephra which was contemporaneous with the peak use of lead alkyl as a petroleum additive in New Zealand. An 8 m piston core was taken in the largest of the lakes, Lake Rotorua, in March 2007. The lake is antipodal to the pre-industrial sources of atmospheric lead but still shows increasing lead concentrations from <2 up to 3.5 mu g g(-1) between the Whakatane eruption (5530 +/- 60 cal. yr BP) and the Tarawera eruption. Peaks in lead concentration in Lake Rotorua are associated with volcanic tephras, but are small compared with those arising from recent anthropogenic-derived lead deposition. Our results show that diagenetic processes associated with iron, manganese and sulfate oxidation-reduction, and sulfide precipitation, act to smooth distributions of lead from anthropogenic sources in the lake sediments. The extent of this smoothing can be related to changes in sulfate availability and reduction in sulfide driven by differences in trophic status amongst the lakes. Greatest lead mobilisation occurs in mesotrophic lakes during seasonal anoxia as iron and manganese are released to the porewater, allowing upward migration of lead towards the sediment-water interface. This lead mobilisation can only occur if sulfides are not present. The sub-surface peak in lead concentrations in lake sediments ascribed to lead alkyl in petroleum persists despite the diagenetic processes acting to disperse lead within the sediments and into the overlying water.

The year 1999 not only brought one of the highest floods of the last 180 years but also one of the earliest in the season. The 1999 extreme event was caused by heavy rainfall in the alpine and pre-alpine regions. The influence of precipitation in the two distinct regional catchments on lake level variations can be quantified by correlation analysis. The long-term variations in lake level and precipitation show similar patterns. This is seen through the use of spectral analysis, which gives similar bands of spectral densities for precipitation and lake level time series. It can be concluded from the comparison of these results with the analysis of climate change patterns in northern Europe, i.e. the index of the North Atlantic Oscillation, that the regional effects on lake level variations are more pronounced than those of global climate change.

These bacteria are adapted to oxygen limitation with respect to their affinity for oxygen, ability to survive periods of anoxia, and immediate response to the appearance of oxygen. In this study the techniques of specific amplification of ammonia oxidiser 16S rDNA fragments by PCR, separation of mixed PCR samples by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and band identification by specific hybridisation with oligonucleotide probes were combined to allow for the comparison of the community composition of multiple samples over space and time. DGGE bands of interest were also excised for DNA isolation, reamplification, sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis. We compared monthly samples from both the root zone and the bare sediment of a shallow lake inhabited by the emergent macrophyte Glyceria maxima to determine the seasonal effects that the plant roots and the oxygen availability might have on the beta-subgroup ammonia-oxidiser populations present. Similarly, five soil or sediment samples, varying in oxygen availability, from different locations in the Netherlands were compared. Although the presence of two previously defined Nitrosospira sequence clusters could be differentially detected in the samples examined, there was no evidence for a particular group which was specific to periodically anoxic environments.

Preliminary Evidence for Iodate Reduction in Bottom Waters of the Gulf of Mexico During an Hypoxic Event	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The distributions of iodate and total inorganic iodine concentrations in the waters on the Texas-Louisiana shelf in April, June, and August 2004 are described. Iodine-salinity graphs show three-end-member mixing involving onshore and offshore surface waters and deep offshore water. The April survey showed simple mixing on the surface, but in the later surveys, iodate concentrations were often much lower than predicted by the mixing curve while those for total inorganic iodine were higher. This demonstrated both iodate reduction in the water and iodide addition, although individual samples did not show equivalent speciation changes. Hydrographically, the system consists of the estuaries of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers as they spill onto the shelf. The waters are stratified seasonally by a robust halocline, leading to hypoxia in the bottom waters from the combined effect of restricted downward diffusion of oxygen and the sinking of the luxuriant growth of phytoplankton induced by riverine nutrient supply. The distributions of iodate and total inorganic iodine are, therefore, interpreted in terms of water-sediment interaction as the shelf shoals to the north.

Better understanding of altitude illness is associated with a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness (AMS). The purpose of this study is to compare, for the first time, the incidence and understanding of altitude illness between foreign trekkers and indigenous porters in Nepal. Methods.-Interviews and questionnaires were completed at the International Porter Protection Group Rescue Post at Machermo (4470 m). Participants completed the Lake Louise acute mountain sickness self-assessment questionnaire. They were also asked about their actions in response to high altitude illness scenarios as well as their perception of the vulnerability of porters vs trekkers to altitude illness. Ascent profile, age, gender, ethnic origin, and altitude of home residence were also obtained. Results.-Trekkers (n=131) had a significantly higher incidence of AMS (21% vs 8%) than porters (n = 92; P < .02). Lowland porters (whose home villages were below 3050 m, n = 61) had a numerically higher, though not significantly different, incidence of AMS (10% vs 3%) compared to highland porters (n = 31). The majority of trekkers and porters recognized the symptoms of altitude illness and the most appropriate action to be taken. Despite the lower incidence of AMS in porters, around half felt that they were at greater risk than trekkers. Conclusions.-Porters had a lower incidence of AMS, which may be attributable to repeated ascents through the trekking season, or differences in reporting symptoms. Both trekkers and porters demonstrated appropriate knowledge of actions to be taken in response to altitude illness.																			1080-6032	1545-1534				FAL	2011	22	3					197	201		10.1016/j.wem.2011.06.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wem.2011.06.001								21962045					WOS:000295749100001

Results demonstrate the potential that: (1) recurrent supervised ANN and EA facilitate 1-week-ahead forecasting of outbreaks of harinful algae or water quality changes, (2) EA discover explanatory rule sets for timing and abundance of harinful outbreaks algal populations, and (3) non-supervised ANN provide clusters to unravel ecological relationships regarding seasons, water quality ranges and long-term environmental changes.

I studied chydorid ephippia from sediments of two small lakes (Kaksoislammi and Rutikka) in southern Finland. The relative adundance of chydorid ephippia periodically increased during the Holocene. Ephippia were abundant during the late Pleistocene/ early Holocene transition, reflecting the severe climate (short open-water season) that existed prior to the onset of rapid postglacial warming. Both lakes experienced an environmental change in the late Holocene. In Kaksoislammi there was a dramatic change in predator-prey relationships following a decline in pH. All chydorids responded with increased gamogenesis. Prehistoric anthropogenic activities caused a rise in the trophic state in Rutikka and probably caused changes in the predator/food web. One chydorid, Alona affinis, reacted first with increased gamogenesis and then almost disappeared. These first results of ephippium analysis indicate that the method has a great potential in detecting periods of environmental change during the Holocene.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2004	526	1			SI		129	136		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041595.08121.ab	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041595.08121.ab													WOS:000223915900013

However, there are few records of Bond events during the Holocene in arid central Asia; such events remain poorly understood in this region because of a lack of continuous and high-resolution deposits. Here, new magnetic and grain-size records from a loess sediment sequence located on the southern margin of the Tarim Basin (TB) are provided, which exhibit strengthened dust activity at 9.6-9.4, 8.2-7.8, and 5.5-5.2 ka BP. These periods of strengthened dust activity during the early and middle Holocene in the TB are consistent with Bond events revealed from ice raft detritus in the North Atlantic, and abrupt climate events recorded by loess deposits, lake deposits, and stalagmite oxygen isotopes in arid central Asia and east Asia. We suggest that a delayed seasonal jet transition, resulting from the intensification and southward-shift of the westerly jet during Bond events, plays a key role in creating conditions in the TB that favor strengthened dust activity.

Mineralogy of dust deposited during the Harmattan season in Ghana	GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												In Ghana, a dust-laden Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara in the period November to March. Some of the dust is trapped in the vegetation, in lakes and other inland waters, and a little on the bare land, whereas the rest of the dust is blown,farther away to the Ivory Coast or out into the Atlantic Ocean. In this project, we studied samples of dust and topsoils in various agroecological zones, from the north to the south of Ghana, focussing mainly on the mineralogy of these materials. Some data about grain sizes and morphology of the samples are also presented. Feldspars, together with quartz, are the common minerals found in Harmattan dust, but the relative contents of K-feldspars and plagioclase vary markedly in the different zones. This variation is consistent with changes in the relative content of the feldspars in the topsoil, indicating a substantial local contribution to the Harmattan dust. This conclusion is supported by the clay mineralogy of the samples. However the pH of the dust is significantly higher than that of the local soils, indicating that a substantial amount of the dust comes from the Sahara.

J	Marret, F; Maley, J; Scourse, J				Marret, Fabienne; Maley, Jean; Scourse, James			Climatic instability in west equatorial Africa during the Mid- and Late Holocene	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					32nd International Geological Congress	AUG 20-28, 2004	Florence, ITALY					Millennial-scale climatic variations have punctuated the Holocene characterised by abrupt changes from warm to cool or wetter to drier conditions. Amongst these climatic events, there is increased evidence for an abrupt multicentennial shift of climatic conditions around 3.8/3.7 kyr BP (4.1 cal. kyr BP) in mid- to low-latitude regions which had a profound impact on landscape and population migration. In the Mediterranean region, subtropical, tropical and equatorial Africa, a number of continental proxies (lake-levels, pollen sequences, stable isotopes) record this abrupt change towards drier conditions. However, regionalism in climatic conditions is reflected in the vegetation records, possibly in relation to orographic conditions and the influence of sea-surface conditions. Hitherto there have been very few marine sequences that record this particular climatic shift at high-resolution. We present here new data from the Congo deep-sea fan containing integrated marine and terrestrial proxies. Around 5-4 cal. kyr BP, shifts in surface conditions off the Congo River mouth are observed, with possible establishment of seasonal coastal upwelling, and lower sea-surface temperatures. In parallel, pollen data indicate fluctuations of herbaceous, afromontane taxa and charred grass cuticles, suggesting more open vegetation in the lowland regions and an increase in cloud forest and/or afromontane vegetation at higher altitudes within the Congolese region.

One of the largest riverine wetlands in the world is the floodplain (varzea) of the Amazon River and its tributaries (Junk and Piedade, 1997). The central Amazon wetlands are constituted by a complex network of lakes and floodplains, named varzeas, that extend over more than 300,000 km(2) (Junk, W.J., The Amazon floodplain- a sink or source for organic carbon? In Transport of Carbon and Minerals in Major World Rivers, edited by E.T. Degens, S. Kempe, R. Herrera, SCOPE/UNEP; 267-283, 1985.) and are among the most productive ecosystems in the world due to the regular enrichment in nutrients by river waters In order to understand if the adjacent floodplain of Amazon River have a significant influence on the trace element concentrations and fluxes of the mainstem, the concentrations of selected elements (i.e., Al, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu Mo, Rb, Sr, B a, and U) have been measured in the Amazon River water (Manacapuru Station, Amazonas State, Brazil) and in lake waters and plants (leaves) from a varzea (Ilha de Marchantaria, Amazonas State, Brazil) during different periods of the hydrological cycle. Four plant species (two perennial species: Pseudobombax munguba and Salix humboldtiana, and two annual herbaceous plants: Echinochloa polystachya and Eichhornia crassipes) were selected to represent the ecological functioning of the site. Time series obtained for dissolved Mn and Cu (< 0.20 mu m) in Amazon River water could not be explained by tributary mixing or instream processes only. Therefore, the contribution of the waters transiting the floodplains should be considered. These results suggest that the chemical composition of the waters draining these floodplains is controlled by reactions occurring at sediment-water and plant-water interfaces. Trace elements concentrations in the plants (leaves) vary strongly with hydrological seasonality. Based on the concentration data and the biological productivity of floodplain ecosystems, a first order approximation of trace element storage (permanent or temporary) in the vegetation of these floodplains was made. It was found that floodplain-mainstem elemental fluxes make a significant contribution to the dissolved flux of the Amazon River.

Aishwarya			Ghost fishing capacity of lost experimental gillnets: a preliminary study from Indian waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear contributes considerably to global marine debris. These lost gears, mostly made of non-biodegradable synthetic materials, persist in the marine environment for longer periods of time and pose a great threat to marine life by entangling and killing target fishes and other non-target species such as turtles, birds, and mammals, a phenomenon known as ghost fishing. Other environmental impacts include physical impacts on aquatic habitats, transfer of microplastics into food web, and interference with fishing. Information regarding the catching efficiency and catch rates of lost nets in Indian waters is lacking. Ghost fishing capacity of simulated lost gillnets is being reported for the first time in India. This study investigates the ghost fishing capacity of lost gillnets through an experimental approach at Aroor, Vembanad lake, Kerala, India. Simulation studies using purposefully abandoned shrimp gillnets (32 mm mesh size) were conducted to understand the fishing capacity of lost gillnets during two seasons (monsoon and post-monsoon) as separate experiments. The gillnets maintained their catching efficiency until the 15th day during the first experiment and up to the 50th day in the second experiment. Catches showed an exponential reduction over time in both experiments. A total of 251 specimens comprising of 27 species were caught from both sets of experimental nets, and the state of catch in the nets showed different decaying stages from the second day itself along with fresh stages. As the days progressed, particulate matter and detritus began to accumulate on the experimental nets, increasing net visibility and reducing their catching efficiency. The results of the study on ghost fishing capability will contribute to the development of strategies for reducing the effects of lost nets on the aquatic ecosystem and for suggesting improved management strategies.

A synoptic climatology of potential seiche-inducing winds in a large intermontane lake: Quesnel Lake, British Columbia, Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Excitation of basin-scale, internal waves (i.e., internal seiches) in lakes require spatially homogeneous wind fields that vary on time scales comparable to the seiche period, which can be on the order of several days in large lakes. We evaluate 2 years (October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2018) of 15-min wind data from a shore-based meteorological station to identify strong wind episodes likely to excite internal seiches in a large and geometrically complex lake surrounded by convoluted topography, Quesnel Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Our findings include the identification of strong wind event seasonality, with peak mean monthly wind speeds in April and November, and minimum mean monthly wind speeds in August. Using geopotential heights (GPHs) from 1.5 degrees x 1.5 degrees gridded reanalysis data to reconstruct the atmospheric state for each strong wind episode, two primary synoptic patterns are identified that, in conjunction with local topographic channelling, lead to either easterlies or westerlies occurring at our sampling station, with strong easterly episodes three times more frequent than westerly episodes. This highlights the important role that developing low-pressure systems in the Northeastern Pacific Basin have in setting up the GPH gradient required for persistent strong winds at Quesnel Lake, in the hours and days before these storms make landfall. The projection of synoptic patterns of strong wind events onto a 4 x 3 self-organizing map clustered strong wind events by mean wind direction, similar to the results of a manual classification. Methods to identify the strong wind episodes and the resulting self-organizing map are both evaluated in-part by two case studies where strong winds are known to have excited a basin-scale baroclinic response in Quesnel Lake.

Developing Model-Based Indices of Lake Whitefish Abundance Using Commercial Fishery Catch and Effort Data in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Fishery catch per effort (CPE) is often used to assess relative fish abundance, and in many Great Lakes and other freshwater applications the CPE index is based on either an average or the ratio of summed aggregate catch to summed aggregate effort. In particular, assessments used to estimate the abundance of lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and recommend harvest quotas in 1836 Treaty-ceded waters of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior assume that commercial CPE from gill-net and trap-net Fisheries is proportional to abundance; however, CPE may change due to factors other than abundance, leading to violations of this assumption. To account for sources of CPE variation that are not attributable to abundance, general linear mixed models (GLMMs) were developed for each management unit and least-squares means (LSMs) for each year were used as the index of abundance. The effect Of using the GLMM method for standardization was evaluated by examining the temporal trends in the proportional difference between LSMs and CPE (i.e., aggregate catch divided by aggregate effort for each year). Of the random effects included in the final GLMM for the gill-net fishery, license holder accounted for the most variation. The fixed effect of boat size category on CPE depended on lakes on average, there was little difference between boat sizes in Lake Superior, whereas large boats had a lower CPE than medium and small boats in Lakes Michigan and Huron. On average. CPE was higher from October to December than during other months. The proportional difference between LSMs and CPE trended through time in some management units. suggesting the importance of adjusting fishery CPE for effects like boat size, season, and license holder. Factors that influence lake whitefish commercial fishery CPE are similar to factors important for marine commercial fisheries.

J	Kelderman, P; Wei, Z; Maessen, M				Kelderman, P; Wei, Z; Maessen, M			Water and mass budgets for estimating phosphorus sediment-water exchange in Lake Taihu (China P. R.)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Since a few decades, Lake Taihu, one of the largest fresh water lakes in China, has suffered from eutrophication problems, with total P and N level values up to 0.15 mg P/1 and 2.5 mg N/1. To show the evident role of P sediment-water exchange in the take, annual P budgets of Lake Taihu were set up for the period 1998-2000. Reliable water budgets could be derived as a basis for the subsequent P mass budgets. For the latter, the P accumulation rates by the sediment, as a 'fitting term' of the P mass budgets, were found to be between 1000 and 1060 x 10(3) kg P/yr (= 1.2 mg P/m(2) day). This P accumulation amounts to around 65% of the total P inputs into the lake; it represents both physico-chemical processes (adsorption/precipitation, etc.) as well as physical sedimentation of particulate matter. No significant seasonal trends in the P sediment-water exchange were observed here. The particulate P profiles in the upper sediment layers of the lake indicate that, especially for the relatively-polluted north-western sub-lakes, the sediment P uptake capacity has now gradually been depleted. Restoration measures, such as sediment dredging in the NW sub-lakes, will be necessary to improve the Lake Taihu water quality in the coming years.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 1	2005	544						167	175		10.1007/s10750-005-0542-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-0542-5													WOS:000231958500013

Atmospheric deposition is an important pathway for human and natural nutrients to enter water ecosystems. Previous studies have focused on hotspot areas, but neglected the impact of atmospheric deposition on reservoirs in desert grassland regions with little rainfall, long freezing periods, and a dusty climate. In this study, we measured the contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, the isotopic composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15), and the ratio of total organic carbon to total nitrogen (C/N ratios) for SPOM in the reservoir and its watershed across both dry and wet seasons using carbon and nitrogen isotope techniques. We also analyzed the sources of SPOM in the reservoir using the end-member mixing model. The results showed that the variation range in SPOM for delta C-13 was - 28.3 to - 21.8 & PTSTHOUSND;; for delta N-15, it was 2.3 to 8.7 & PTSTHOUSND;; and the C/N ratios were 8.12 to 19.12. The variation range of delta C-13 for atmospheric particulate matter was - 20.0 to - 25.0 & PTSTHOUSND;; for delta N-15, it was 2.3 to 11.9 & PTSTHOUSND;; and the C/N ratios ranged from 7.22 to 17.81. The main sources of carbon in the SPOM were atmospheric deposition and terrestrial C3 plants. The origins were significantly different between the wet and dry periods. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition and soil erosion were the primary sources of particulate nitrogen in the reservoir.

High quantitative characteristics were also recorded. The maximum abundance and biomass of zooplankton were recorded in the sites with hydatophytes (the degree of overgrowing 10-50%). These parameters are significantly lower in the sites with helophytes (the degree of overgrowing up to 100%). It is concluded that the difference between zooplankton communities in the sites with helophytes and in the sites with submerged macrophytes within particular stations is determined by the top-down effect of predators. The Shannon index increases and quantitative parameters of plankton invertebrates decrease with increasing predator press.

Source water provenance can be estimated both from field observations of chemical characteristics of water and from numerical modeling approaches. This paper highlights the strengths and shortcomings of two methods. One method uses stable isotope compositions of oxygen and hydrogen from water in field-collected samples to build a mixing model. The second method uses a calibrated hydrodynamic model with numerical tracers released from upstream reaches to estimate source-water fraction throughout the model domain. Both methods were applied to our study area in the eastern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a freshwater tidal system which is dominated by fluvial processes during the flood season. In this paper, we show that both methods produce similar source water fraction values, implying the usefulness of both despite their shortcomings, and fortifying the use of hydrodynamic tracers to model transport in a natural system.					; Nakamoto, Bobby/HSF-0763-2023; Fogel, Marilyn/M-2395-2015	Jeffres, Carson/0000-0001-6532-6851; 														2073-4441				APR	2020	12	4							1128	10.3390/w12041128	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12041128													WOS:000539527500205

Whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) respiration rate governs intra-otolith variation of δ13C values in Lake Annecy	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We generated 10 high-resolution profiles of stable carbon and oxygen isotope values (delta C-13(oto) and delta O-18(oto)) of sagittal otoliths of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) from Lake Annecy (France) to determine the factors that control intra-individual delta C-13(oto) variation. Dominant patterns of intra-otolith variation compared well with seasonal and age-specific respiration modeling. Conversely, intra-otolith variation of delta C-13 values did not compare well with measured dietary and environmental variation. We infer that the proportion of metabolically sourced carbon (M) is the dominant control on intra-otolith variation. Current models of otolith carbon incorporation provide different estimates of M. Once appropriate fractionation factors among otolith, endolymph, blood, and carbon sources are elucidated, delta C-13(oto) values will reveal energetic, environmental, and dietary information of teleost fish for past and present populations. Used in conjunction with delta O-18(oto) values, delta C-13(oto) values will be powerful proxies of fish environment, behavior, and evolution.					; Wurster, Christopher/A-1983-2011	Wurster, Christopher/0000-0002-2866-5798; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2007	64	12					1736	1746		10.1139/F07-132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F07-132													WOS:000252760000010

Population ecology and prey consumption by fathead minnows in prairie wetlands: importance of detritus and larval fish	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The fathead minnow Pimephales promelas occurs in high densities in wetlands of the prairie pothole region (PPR) of North America, but food resources sustaining these populations are poorly known. We assessed population dynamics and prey consumption of fathead minnow populations in three PPR wetlands for 2 years. Fish density peaked at 107 fish per m(2) for all age classes combined. Larval and juvenile fish dominated these populations in terms of abundance and accounted for 83% of total prey consumption. Detritus dominated fish diets, representing 53%, 40% and 79% of diet mass for larval, juvenile and adult fish respectively. Detritus consumption was positively related to minnow density and negatively related to invertebrate abundance, but only for adult fish. Seasonal production:biomass ratios were unrelated to proportions of detritus in the diet for all ages of fish, indicating that detritus is an important food resource capable of meeting metabolic demands and sustaining fish growth in high-density populations. Detritus consumption may also weaken links between abundance of invertebrate prey and minnows, promoting dense fish populations with strong, consistent influences on wetland ecosystems.																			0906-6691					SEP	2007	16	3					282	294		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00220.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00220.x													WOS:000249096500002

However, relatively little is known about how sex and reproduction influence food use by aquatic herbivores. We measure male:female ratios in the field and studied sexual differences in algal food choice and feeding rates for the amphipod Gammarus aequicauda from a desert saline lake, where it is the most abundant mesograzer during the colder months. We also assessed the effects of precopulatory pairing and female egg development on feeding behavior. Males were more numerous than females over two sampling periods and significantly preferred one algal species in each of three pairwise food-choice combinations tested. Females were moderately less selective, expressing a preference in only two of these experiments, but showed significantly higher total consumption and feeding rates than males in most assays. When males and females expressed similar preferences, the magnitude of these preferences (% differences in consumption between the algae offered) was statistically equivalent for both sexes. Patterns of compensatory feeding on less nutritious algae were significant and similar for both sexes. Mated pairs had reduced feeding rates compared to unpaired females, but not unpaired males. In contrast, no short-term differences in feeding rates were detected for males and females separated from precopula or between females at two stages of egg development. Variations in population sex ratios and reproductive cycles can potentially modulate interactions between aquatic consumers and their food sources.

The dataset includes 15,525 records (12,015 of which with georeferenced coordinates) of 584 valid species and subspecies names and other taxa at family level, gathered from 332 published papers. The published literature spans the period from 1838 to 2022, with the lowest number of papers published during the first half of the twentieth century, followed by an increasing number of papers, from 20 to more than 60 in each decade. The Italian regions with the highest number of records and species are Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, and Piedmont, whereas no records are known for Molise. The number of species known from each region mostly mirrors sampling efforts, measured as the number of publications per region.

Effects of Hypoxia on Coupled Carbon and Iron Cycling Differ Between Weekly and Multiannual Timescales in Two Freshwater Reservoirs	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Freshwater lakes and reservoirs play a disproportionate role in the global organic carbon (OC) budget, as active sites for carbon processing and burial. Associations between OC and iron (Fe) are hypothesized to contribute substantially to the stabilization of OC in sediment, but the magnitude of freshwater Fe-OC complexation remains unresolved. Moreover, global declines in bottom-water oxygen concentrations have the potential to alter OC and Fe cycles in multiple ways, and the net effects of low-oxygen (hypoxic) conditions on OC and Fe are poorly characterized. Here, we measured the pool of Fe-bound OC (Fe-OC) in surficial sediments from two eutrophic reservoirs, and we paired whole-ecosystem experiments with sediment incubations to determine the effects of hypoxia on OC and Fe cycling over multiple timescales. Our experiments demonstrated that short periods (2-4 weeks) of hypoxia can increase aqueous Fe and OC concentrations while decreasing OC and Fe-OC in surficial sediment by 30%. However, exposure to seasonal hypoxia over multiple years was associated with a 57% increase in sediment OC and no change in sediment Fe-OC. These results suggest that the large sediment Fe-OC pool (similar to 30% of sediment OC in both reservoirs) contains both oxygen-sensitive and oxygen-insensitive fractions, and over multiannual timescales OC respiration rates may play a more important role in determining the effect of hypoxia on sediment OC than Fe-OC dissociation. Consequently, we anticipate that global declines in oxygen concentrations will alter OC and Fe cycling, with the direction and magnitude of effects dependent upon the duration of hypoxia. Plain Language Summary Freshwater lakes and reservoirs (hereafter: lakes) play a remarkably important role in the global carbon cycle, as important sites for both carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. The extent to which lakes sequester carbon versus release greenhouse gases depends upon many factors, including associations between carbon and iron that can help to preserve carbon in sediment. However, global declines in freshwater oxygen concentrations have the potential to affect these chemical complexes. Here, we added oxygen to the bottom waters of a lake to test how changes in oxygen concentration affect carbon and iron cycling. We found that over short timescales (weeks), low oxygen conditions decreased the amount of carbon in sediment by breaking apart associations between iron and carbon that help retain carbon in sediment. However, over long timescales (years), low oxygen conditions appeared to increase carbon burial by decreasing the rate at which carbon inputs were decomposed. These results suggest that declining oxygen concentrations in lakes around the world may have important effects on global carbon cycling, with the direction and magnitude of the impact depending on the duration of low oxygen conditions.

However, the CH4 emissions from lakes can be highly variable, and the emissions from the river inlet region were less studied, which seriously hamper our understanding of CH4 budget estimates of lakes. Here, field measurements from over six years (2012 to 2017) at Lake Taihu, a large eutrophic shallow lake with a complicated river network, were conducted to address the issue. Results show that the river inlet region of the lake was a hot spot of CH4 emission. The CH4 emission at the river inlet region with an annual mean value of 0.183 mmol m(-2) d(-1) was seven times higher than that at pelagic region (0.028 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Peak CH4 emission occurred in warm seasons, and the lowest in cold seasons at the pelagic region, but peak emission occurred in cold seasons at the river inlet region. The seasonal CH4 emission at the pelagic region can be explained by water temperature; however, less temperature dependency of CH4 emission at the river inlet region was found. The variability of CH4 emission was linked to pollution loadings, and CH4-rich water in the inflowing river likely sustained the large CH4 emission of river inlet region.

J	Neto, IEL				Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo			Modeling water quality in a tropical reservoir using CE-QUAL-W2: handling data scarcity, urban pollution and hydroclimatic seasonality	RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS												This study applies a 2-D hydrodynamic model (CE-QUAL-W2) for simulating water quality dynamics in a tropical reservoir located in Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil. While rainfall concentrates basically in the first semester, this reservoir receives untreated sewage from an urban catchment throughout the year. To deal with data scarcity, model simplifications are justified and several adjustments are carried out, so that only the parameters temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a (Chla) and phosphate (PO4) are kept in the modeling process. Additionally, different assumptions are performed regarding the time-evolution of reservoir inlet concentrations: constant values, step and linear variations. The results indicate that the simplified model can predict well the seasonal variations of T, DO, Chla and PO4. The best fitting between model results and measurements are obtained with the assumption of linear variation in inlet concentrations, followed by the assumptions of constant values and step variation. Moreover, the results reveal that while PO4 presents a complete mixing behavior with a clear increase in concentration from the wet to the dry season, T, DO and Chla show an alternating stratification-destratification patter during the day-night but without relevant variations throughout the year. Model simulations of different scenarios also indicate a significant reduction in Chla concentration in the second semester, but external load reduction has a stronger impact on model outputs than hydroclimatic variability. The modeling approach developed in the present study is proposed as a simple way to cope with data scarcity, urban pollution and hydroclimatic seasonality in tropical reservoirs.

The results indicate that the optimal bands for estimation vary monthly due to temperature fluctuations. In the TN model, the power function model at 586 nm in January exhibited the strongest fit, yielding a fit coefficient (R-2) of 0.95 and F-value of 164.57 at a significance level (p) of less than 0.01. Conversely, the exponential model at 477 nm in June provided the best fit, with R-2 = 0.93 and F = 80.95 at p < 0.01. In the TP model, the exponential model fit of the differential values at 851 nmwith TP in January produced the best results, with R-2 = 0.78 and F= 20.61. However, the overall fit in June outperformed that in January. Specifically, the quadratic and linear model fits of the differential values at 824 and 863 nm with TP achieved R-2 = 0.96 and F-values of 34.42 and 203.34, respectively.

Our study focuses on 82 phase-based GNSS-R tracks collected by Spire Global grazing angle satellites in 2021 over Lake Okeechobee, FL. For each track, we calculate its spatial footprint (assumed equal to the First Fresnel Zone (FFZ)) and determine the amount of surface water within the FFZ using a lake mask derived from the 2021 Global Surface Water Explorer (GWSE) Seasonality product. The percentage of surface water in the signal footprint (denoted %F) is compared with the reflected signal's SNR and level of coherency, with coherency measured by the phase-rate circular length. Overall, we see a positive relationship between SNR, circular length, and %F. However, circular length appears to be a more robust indicator of water, with more consistent, high magnitudes once the scattering surface is dominantly water (>70%F). Further, circular length appears to maintain a high magnitude at different distances into Lake Okeechobee when the footprint is full of water, whereas SNR gradually decreases as the signal track approaches the center of the lake. This is most likely a result of wind roughening the lake surface farther away from the shore.

This study examines the type and timing of sensor information to support in- season management. Methods and key findings A three-year study in a 2.6 ha vineyard collected yield, pruning mass, canopy vigor, and soil data, including yield and pruning mass from the previous year, at 321 sites. Stepwise linear regression and random forest regression approaches were used to model site-specific yield and pruning mass using historical spatial production data, multi-temporal in-season canopy vigor, and soil data. The more complex yield elaboration process was best modelled with non-linear random forest regression, while the simpler development of pruning mass was best modelled by linear regression. Conclusions and significance Canopy vigor in the weeks preceding bloom was the most important predictor of the current season's yield and should be used to generate stratified sampling designs for crop estimation at 30 days after bloom. In contrast, pruning mass was not well- predicted by canopy vigor; even late-season canopy vigor, which is widely advocated to estimate pruning mass in viticulture. The previous year's pruning mass was the dominant predictor of pruning mass in the current season. To model pruning mass going forward, the best approach is to start measuring it. Further work is still needed to develop robust, local site-specific yield and pruning mass models for operational decision-making in Concord vineyards.					; Taylor, James/E-6616-2011	Taylor, James/0000-0001-9709-8689; 													0002-9254	1943-7749				JAN 1	2023	74	1							0740013	10.5344/ajev.2022.22050	http://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2022.22050													WOS:001053405700001

Responses of breeding waterbird communities to environmental changes in subsidence wetlands in the North China Plain	AVIAN RESEARCH												In the context of global degradation and loss of natural wetlands, waterbirds have been increasingly using artificial wetlands as alternative habitats. However, waterbirds are facing various threats in these artificial wetlands, due to dramatic environmental changes induced by anthropogenic activities. Exploring the effects of these changes on the temporal dynamics of the waterbird communities can help understand how waterbirds adapt to environmental changes and thus formulate effective management and conservation plans. In this study, we carried out field surveys on waterbirds and environmental factors across 20 subsidence wetlands created by underground coal mining in the Huainan coal mining area in the breeding seasons of 2016 and 2021. We predicted that the waterbird assemblages (i.e., number of individuals, species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, Pielou evenness and species composition) differed between the two years, and that these differences were correlated with the temporal changes in environmental factors. Across the surveyed wetlands, we recorded 26 waterbird species in 2016 and 23 in 2021. For individual wetlands, the number of waterbird individuals and species richness increased by 71.6% and 20.1%, respectively, over the five years, with no changes in Shannon-Wiener diversity and Pielou evenness. The overall increase in the number of bird individuals was mainly caused by an increase in vegetation gleaners and gulls that adapt well to anthropogenic activities. The species composition was significantly different between the two years, which was mainly caused by changes in the number of individuals of dominant species under influence of changes in human activities. For most wetlands, the temporal pairwise & beta;-diversities could be explained by species turnover rather than nestedness, probably due to high mobility of waterbird species and dramatic changes in local environments. Our study suggests that waterbird communities could respond to environmental changes in subsidence wetlands, providing important implications for waterbird conservation in human-dominated artificial wetlands.					li, chunlin/KFS-0761-2024; Li, Weiqiang/JHU-9143-2023														2053-7166						2023	14								100110	10.1016/j.avrs.2023.100110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2023.100110													WOS:001014764900001

Existing RSSOD datasets have limitations in terms of scale, and scene categories, which make them misaligned with real-world applications. To address these shortcomings, we construct the RSSOD-Bench dataset, which contains images from four different cities in the USA (1). The dataset provides annotations for various salient object categories, such as buildings, lakes, rivers, highways, bridges, aircraft, ships, athletic fields, and more. The salient objects in RSSOD-Bench exhibit large-scale variations, cluttered backgrounds, and different seasons. Unlike existing datasets, RSSOD-Bench offers uniform distribution across scene categories. We benchmark 23 different state-of-the-art approaches from both the computer vision and remote sensing communities. Experimental results demonstrate that more research efforts are required for the RSSOD task.

Fish samples were collected using gillnets of different stretched mesh sizes. Except for temperature and pH, most physico-chemical variables revealed significant spatial variation (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Fishes were highly correlated with the concentration of dissolved oxygen (r approximate to 0.8, p < 0.01) and electrical conductivity (r approximate to 0.89, p < 0.01). Three fish species include Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758), Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) and Labeobarbus intermedius (Ruppell, 1835) were identified (H' = 1.06). The diversity indices did not show variations among seasons (H' = 0.98-0.907) and sites (H' = 1.04-1.07). All the fish species occurred in all sampling sites and seasons. Oreochromis niloticus (41.9%) was the most important and abundant fish species followed by C. gariepinus (38.2% by %IRI). The relative importance index showed O. niloticus (45.4%) was the most abundant species in the dry season. However, C. gariepinus (73.3%) was the most abundant species in the wet season. Before the construction of the Ribb Dam, the Ribb River was dominated by about eight species. However, in the current study (after the construction of the Ribb Dam), only three species were found. Results revealed that the diversity of fishes has decreased primarily due to the dam effect followed by anthropogenic impacts such as poor land management systems, high sedimentation load, excessive irrigation and illegal fishing. Therefore, an appropriate dam design with a fish ladder and effective watershed management setup is needed to sustain fish resource utilization in the country for food security.					; Tesfahun, Agumassie/KDN-9068-2024	Tesfahun, Agumassie/0000-0001-6387-0546; 													2331-1932					DEC 31	2022	8	1							2105934	10.1080/23311932.2022.2105934	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2022.2105934													WOS:000833919800001

In Yancheng city, an eco-civilized city, the spatiotemporal characteristics of water quality indexes and the eutrophication degree were evaluated in Julong lake (JL) artificial ecological restoration and campus natural landscape (YCIT) waters. Since ecological restoration in 2016, the seasonal average concentrations of N, P in JL waters have been significantly decreased by more than 70%, satisfying the standards for water quality with light eutrophication. Conversely, the European Flower Street (EFS) and YCIT waters were hyper eutrophic, severely exceeding the Grade V water quality standard. The spatial distribution of ULWs quality deterioration in the plain area indicated that the human activities and endogenous pollutions contributed to ULWs eutrophication because of sluices controlling and low flow rate. This study provided a scientific basis for controlling the ULWs eutrophication via integrated eco-remediation technology in plain cities.																			2639-5932	2639-5940				DEC 31	2022	34	1					215	223		10.1080/26395940.2022.2076745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/26395940.2022.2076745													WOS:000802757800001

Using occupancy and species distribution models to assess the conservation status and habitat use of the goldline darter (Percina aurolineata) in Georgia, USA	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The goldline darter (Percina aurolineata) is threatened by recent increases in urbanisation in the Coosawattee River watershed, but no studies have addressed their current status. Similarly, limited data on habitat use make it difficult to understand factors that may impact this species. We compared occurrence data before (1996-2000) and after (2009-2011) a period of rapid development and population growth within the watershed. Single-season occupancy models were built to account for imperfect species detection and to identify habitat covariates. MaxEnt was used to identify important stream reaches for conservation and to understand landscape scale factors correlated with the distribution of goldline darters. Our results indicate a high proportion of sites occupied upstream of Carters Lake during the historic and recent time periods, with no evidence of decline. However, occurrences of goldline darters for sites in Talking Rock Creek and the lower Coosawattee River were sparse in the historic period and absent during the recent period. The probability of detecting goldline darters is low and was positively associated with the occurrence of small substrate. Species distribution models were strongly influenced by watershed area and elevation and indicated a high probability of suitable habitat within the Coosawattee River and large tributaries upstream of Carters Lake. While goldline darter occupancy is currently stable upstream of Carters Lake, continued urbanisation is a threat to long-term persistence. We recommend additional monitoring and describe a protocol that allows for precise estimates of species occupancy while minimising the risk of sampling-related mortality.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2014	23	3					347	359		10.1111/eff.12085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12085													WOS:000337683700006

Facies of silty-clay ochre (wet season) and banded ochre (dry season) from the paleolacustrine setting are composed of jarosite + goethite and goethite respectively. Geochemically, these layers record high concentrations of Fe2O3 (25-55 wt. %) and trace elements (Cu, Zn, Co, As, and Mo with mean concentrations of 2759; 2467; 109; 375 and 116 ppm, respectively). Their origin is inferred from a comparative analysis with the present-day Amarillo river, which has a pH of similar to 3, (SO4)(2-) concentrations of similar to 5000 mg/1, and jarosite as the dominant phase, in the upper catchments. Waters downstream have pH values of 3-4.5, (SO4)(2-) concentrations of similar to 3000-480 mg/1, and schwertmannite as the dominant phase. Thus goethite in the paleolake facies is likely related to schwertmannite transformation by an aging process, whereas jarosite is probably transported from the river but could also be associated with post-depositional formation regulated by variations in grain size and the pore fluid chemistry. The Corral Amarillo Formation offers a Natural model, which may be employed to infer the effect on nature of acid drainage of mineralized areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Animal-plant-microbe interactions: direct and indirect effects of swan foraging behaviour modulate methane cycling in temperate shallow wetlands	OECOLOGIA												Wetlands are among the most important ecosystems on Earth both in terms of productivity and biodiversity, but also as a source of the greenhouse gas CH4. Microbial processes catalyzing nutrient recycling and CH4 production are controlled by sediment physico-chemistry, which is in turn affected by plant activity and the foraging behaviour of herbivores. We performed field and laboratory experiments to evaluate the direct effect of herbivores on soil microbial activity and their indirect effects as the consequence of reduced macrophyte density, using migratory Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell) feeding on fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) tubers as a model system. A controlled foraging experiment using field enclosures indicated that swan bioturbation decreases CH4 production, through a decrease in the activity of methanogenic Archaea and an increased rate of CH4 oxidation in the bioturbated sediment. We also found a positive correlation between tuber density (a surrogate of plant density during the previous growth season) and CH4 production activity. A laboratory experiment showed that sediment sterilization enhances pondweed growth, probably due to elimination of the negative effects of microbial activity on plant growth. In summary, the bioturbation caused by swan grazing modulates CH4 cycling by means of both direct and indirect (i.e. plant-mediated) effects with potential consequences for CH4 emission from wetland systems.

Trophic position of bottom-feeding fish in the Upper Parana River floodplain	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY					3rd Workshop on the Upper Parana River Floodplain - Conservation and Biodiversity	JUN 10-12, 2008	Maringa, BRAZIL					The delta N-15 composition of bottom-feeding fish (iliophagous = Apareiodon affinis, Cyphocharax nagelii, Prochilodus lineatus, Steindachnerina brevipinna and S. insculpta; detritivorous = Loricariichthys platymetopon and Liposarcus anisitsi; benthophagous = Satanoperca pappaterra and Hoplosternum littorale) and their primary food sources were investigated in the upper Parana River floodplain during rainy seasons in different environments (lotic and lentic). Two hypotheses were tested: i) that the trophic position and isotopic values of the investigated organisms (fish and food resources) vary spatially; and ii) that trophic position and isotopic compositions differ among iliophagous, detritivorous and benthophagous fish. C, macrophytes, periphyton and phytoplankton were isotopically different in sites analyzed. Sianificant isotopic differences occurred in the species of each trophic category. Spatial differences were observed in the isotopic composition of P. lineatus and L. platymetopon, whose values were more enriched in the Parana River and Pau Veio Lake. Significant spatial differences in trophic position were observed for L. platymetopon and H. littorale, which presented the highest values in the Parana and Baia rivers, respectively. Trophic positions were significantly different among the species that composed each trophic category. These findings demonstrate that in energy-flow studies in detrital food chains generalizations concerning the grouping of fish into trophic categories and/or habitats should only be carried out after careful investigations of the local/specific trophic dynamics of the organisms.

J	Horppila, J; Niemistö, J				Horppila, Jukka; Niemisto, Juha			Horizontal and vertical variations in sedimentation and resuspension rates in a stratifying lake -: effects of internal seiches	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The temporal and spatial variations in the rate of sedimentation and sediment resuspension in Lake Rehtijarvi (southern Finland) were studied by sediment traps deployed in the stratifying and non-stratifying regions of the lake. Both the gross sedimentation rate and the resuspension rate recorded by near-bottom traps were significantly higher in the stratifying region (> 20 m depth) than in the shallow part of the lake (2 m depth). These rate changes were caused by temporarily elevated hypolimnetic resuspension rates exceeding 40 g dry weight m(-2) day(-1) in July 2005, whereas in the shallow station no such peak was observed and the resuspension rate remained below 30 g dry weight m(-2) day(-1) throughout the study. The elevated resuspension rate in the hypolimnion could not be attributed to surface wave action or sediment disturbance by fish, but was due to the occurrence of internal seiches. The seiche amplitude was on average the highest in July, although the wind velocities were low; this was because winds temporarily were blowing along the longitudinal axis of the lake. Due to the steep slopes, the sediments of Lake Rehtijarvi are prone to redistribution and sediment focusing towards the accumulation areas also affected trap catches in the deep stations.

Downward flux of organic matter and pigments in Lake Kinneret (Israel): relationships between phytoplankton and the material collected in sediment traps	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Sedimentation rates of organic materials and algal pigments were measured by near-bottom traps in Lake Kinneret (Israel) throughout 2006. Pigment composition in the epilimnion and in the traps was compared by trap-to-water indices (TWIs) based on the proportion of a given pigment to the concentration of beta-carotene. The appearance of particular pigment in traps was associated with its ability to decompose and be transferred to the trap. The relative lability of pigments increased in the following order: beta-carotene > lutein+zeaxanthin > Chlorophyll b > Chlorophyll a > echinenone > fucoxanthin > Chlorophyll c > peridinin. A seasonal variability, pertaining to the thermal stratification in the lake was observed in the TWI; it showed highest values during holomixis, and lowest after an establishment of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion. Bacteriochlorophyll e was one of the dominant pigments in traps from mid-July to mid-September, when the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeobacteroides formed dense populations in the metalimnion. Using chlorophyllous pigments as a proxy for biomass, we evaluated the possible contribution of Ch. phaeobacteroides to the total sedimentation flux of all photosynthesizing organisms on an annual basis. The proportion of freshly fixed carbon in the downward flux changed seasonally, depending on the composition of the phytoplankton and thermal stratification, and was on average 22% of primary productivity at the lake centre.

J	McDonald, L; Haxton, T				McDonald, Lauren; Haxton, Tim			Spatiotemporal use of a tributary by lake sturgeon over a 10-year period	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												A telemetry study was conducted on lake sturgeon to determine the seasonal use and environmental factors that stimulate movement within a tributary of a larger system. Over a 10-year period, 52 lake sturgeon implanted with acoustic transmitters were monitored through an array of Vemco receivers with the Blanche River, Ontario. An average of 68% of the tagged fish entered the tributary annually whereas only 19.2% of those were detected on known spawning areas approximately 54 km upstream. Water temperature, lunar phase, lake water level, presumed spawning fish, and water discharge were all considered significant variables associated with the onset of upstream migration. Water temperature (mean 12.9 degrees C) was the only variable that explained the timing and the arrival at the spawning grounds. Sturgeon remained at the spawning area for a mean duration 7.9 days; however, none of the variables examined explained the duration of stay. Water temperature was the only variable that explained departure from the spawning areas (mean 15.8 degrees C). Mean time spent in the river after spawning was 30.5 days. There was not a significant difference in sex or total length in relationship to the duration tagged fish stayed in the river after spawning. The entire Blanche River up to the insuperable rapids was used by the sturgeon with the exception of minor tributaries. Water temperature, river discharge, and fish size were all considered significant factors initiating out-migration back into the lake. This study demonstrated the importance and seasonal use of a tributary by lake sturgeon. Correlations from abiotic variable and seasonal response could be used to establish guidelines for water management purposes when the goal is to conserve or restore sturgeon populations within a river system. This study also illustrates the importance of tributaries in association to a larger waterbody for lake sturgeon.

A total of 3 5 taxa was recorded (two copepods, four cladocerans and 29 rotifers). Species richness was higher than that reported in high mountain lakes in temperate regions and even from other tropical systems. Aspelta psitta., Hexarthra bulgarica canadensis, Cephalodella delicata, and Alonella pulchella were recorded for the first time in Mexico, Although there was a high coincidence in species composition, the lakes displayed large differences in dominant taxa, density, and biomass. Seasonal dynamics of zooplankton taxa in both systems were rather comparable to those reported for temperate high mountain lakes. This pattern likely reflected a cold-dry period when abiotic factors (mainly temperature and pH) regulated the assemblage and a warm-rainy period that was regulated by biotic factors. Our results suggest that most important biotic dissimilarities observed between these two neighboring lakes were due to abiotic environmental conditions (mainly pH); however, we suggest that the relatively recent introduction of fish in one of these lakes has magnified the differences between them.

J	Leppäranta, M; Wang, K				Leppaeranta, Matti; Wang, Keguang			The ice cover on small and large lakes:: scaling analysis and mathematical modelling	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake ice cover is described by its thickness, temperature, stratigraphy and overlying snow layer. When the ratio of ice thickness to lake size is above similar to 10(-5), the ice cover is stable; otherwise, mechanical forcing breaks the ice cover, and ice drifting takes place with lead-opening and ridging. This transition enables a convenient distinction to be made between small and large lakes. The evolution of the ice cover on small lakes is solved by a wholly thermodynamic model, but a coupled mechanical-thermodynamic model is needed for large lakes. The latter indicates a wide distribution of ice thickness, and frazil ice may be formed in openings. Ecological conditions in large lakes differ markedly from those in small lakes because vertical mixing and oxygen renewal may take place during the ice season, and the euphotic zone penetrates well into the water column in thin ice regions. Mesoscale sea ice models are applicable to large lakes with only minor tuning of the key parameters. These model systems are presented and analysed using Lake Peipsi as an example. As the climate changes, the transition size between small and large lake ice cover will change.

Reproductive seasonality in a swamp-locked African cichlid	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												This study quantified the seasonal pattern of reproduction in a swamp-dwelling population of the African cichlid Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae. In the hypoxic waters of the Lwamunda Swamp, Uganda, P. multicolor was reproductively active throughout the year, even during the peak of the dry seasons. However, the degree of activity was seasonal, with rainfall providing a predictor of the percentage of ripe, mature females. There was no correlation between aquatic oxygen availability dissolved oxygen (DO) and either adjusted mean gonad mass or percentage of mature females, suggesting that DO is not limiting reproductive activity in this system. Reproductively mature females were larger during drier periods and may maximise their lifetime reproductive success by producing young throughout the year; but with a lower brooding efficiency. A comparison with Welcomme's (1969) study of a river-swamp system feeding Lake Victoria suggests that reproductive patterning is variable among populations of P. multicolor and may reflect adaptive response to chronically hypoxic conditions in the Lwamunda Swamp.																			0906-6691					MAR	2008	17	1					20	29		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00251.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00251.x													WOS:000252711800003
J	Howard-Williams, C; Hawes, I				Howard-Williams, Clive; Hawes, Ian			Ecological processes in Antarctic inland waters: interactions between physical processes and the nitrogen cycle	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE					9th Scar International Biology Symposium	JUL 25-29, 2005	Curitiba, BRAZIL					In this review we consider the physical processes that shape inland aquatic ecosystems and how these affect ecosystem processes, with particular focus on the nitrogen cycle. Inland Antarctica is dominated by microbial communities that are usually concentrated in, or adjacent to, habitats with free water. The presence of free vs frozen water is dependent on very small changes in temperature around 0 degrees C, so significant variability in the distribution of free water can be expected in response to variations in climate over diel, decadal, to millennial time scales and a range of spatial scales. Antarctic inland waters take many forms: snow-surface melt pockets, cryoconites, basal regions of wet-based glaciers, ponds (varying in salinity and degree of desiccation), melt streams, perennially and seasonally ice covered lakes and even hypersaline, ice free lakes. The important processes and transformations that characterize the nitrogen cycle worldwide have all been identified in Antarctic inland waters and in some cases (e.g. N-uptake, N-fixation), rates are similar to those at lower latitudes. The unique features of Antarctic ecosystems stem from the extreme and variable physical conditions under which these processes operate rather than any unique ecosystem processes per se.

J	Chakraborty, T; Sarkar, S				Chakraborty, T; Sarkar, S			Evidence of lacustrine sedimentation in the Upper Permian Bijori Formation, Satpura Gondwana basin: Palaeogeographic and tectonic implications	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The Upper Permian Bijori Formation of the Satpura Gondwana basin comprising fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, carbonaceous shale/mudstone and thin coal bands was previously interpreted as the deposits of meandering rivers. The present study documents abundance of wave ripples, hummocky and swaley cross-stratification and combined flow bedforms in the Bijori Formation, suggesting that a significant part of the formation was deposited in a wave-agitated environment. Evidence of near-emergent depositional conditions provided by repeated occurrence of rootlet beds and hydromorphic paleosols, local flooding surfaces denoting rapid fluctuation of water level, occurrences of temnospondyl vertebrate fossils, and absence of tidal signatures and marine fossils suggest a lacustrine rather than marine depositional regime. Five facies associations recognised within the Bijori Formation are inferred to represent fluvial channels and associated floodplains (FA1), lake shorelines (FA2), subaqueous distributary channels and associated levees (FA3), wave- and storm-affected delta front (FA4), and open lacustrine/lower shoreface (FA5) deposits. The plano-concave fluvial channel-fill sandbodies with unidirectional cross-beds are clearly distinguishable from the delta front bars that show a convexo-plan or bi-convex sandbody geometry and dominance of wave and combined flow bedforms. Some of the distributary channels record interaction of fluvial and wave-dominated basinal processes. Major distributary sandbodies show a north to northwest flow direction while wave-affected delta front sandbodies show very complex flow patterns reflecting interaction between fluvial discharge and wave processes. Wave ripple crest trends show that the lake shoreline had an overall east-northeast to west-southwest orientation. The lack of documented contemporaneous lacustrine or marine sediments in the Satpura Gondwana basin posed a major problem of basin-scale palaeogeographic reconstruction. The existence of Bijori lake solves the problem and the lake is inferred to have acted as repository for the contemporaneous alluvial drainage. Development of the large Bijori lake body implies generation of accommodation space exceeding the rate of sediment supplied and thus represents locus of high tectonic subsidence. Transition of fluvial sediments with red mudstone and calcareous soil profile in the lower part of the succession to carbonaceous shale and coal-bearing lacustrine sediments in the upper part, denote a change from a warm semi-arid climate with seasonal rainfall to a more humid one.																			2347-4327	0973-774X				JUN	2005	114	3					303	323		10.1007/BF02702952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02702952													WOS:000230149600010

Going, going, gone: evidence for loss of an endemic species pair of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) with implications for protection under species-at-risk legislation	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Genomic extinction occurs when the unique combination of genetic traits that characterize distinct phenotypes are eliminated by introgressive hybridization even if population size is greater than zero. Benthic and limnetic threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) constitute reproductively isolated undescribed biological species that have evolved independently in several lakes in southwestern British Columbia, Canada (known as "species pairs" in each lake). Here we investigated whether the two species that comprise the pair from Enos Lake, southeastern Vancouver Island, remain as two distinct gene pools. Multi-season samples (> 1200 fish) obtained over two years from throughout the lake and assayed for variation in morphological traits characteristic of the two species (i.e., body depth, dorsal spine count, gill raker counts) and at 12 microsatellite DNA loci consistently indicated the existence of only a single group of sticklebacks. There was no consistent evidence of two groups in any morphological trait, and mean gill raker counts were consistently intermediate (20-21) to those of known benthics (similar to 18) and limnetics (similar to 24) which together comprised strikingly bimodal distributions in historical samples. Genetic analyses employing model-based clustering also consistently indicated the presence of only a single genetic group of sticklebacks. Compared to historical samples and to benthics and limnetics from other lakes, no Enos Lake fish could be identified confidently as a pure benthic or limnetic. Our results provide the strongest evidence yet that the Enos Lake sticklebacks now consist of a single morphological and genetic population of sticklebacks, that the unique combination of genetic and morphological traits that characterized benthic and limnetic sticklebacks no longer exist, and that their current status under Canada's Species-at Risk Act as Endangered should be re-evaluated.

However, the records are not easily accessible and are dispersed within different government departments. Given this, a major effort was undertaken in order to gather all available observations into a common database-the Canadian Ice Database (CID). This database will respond to the needs for climate monitoring in Canada, the validation and improvement of numerical ice models and the development of new remote-sensing methods. Indeed, several studies have shown that freshwater ice and sea ice are good proxy indicators of climate variability and change. The first version of CID contains in situ observations from 757 sites distributed across Canada, which were originally kept on digital or paper records at the Meteorological Service of Canada Headquarters and the Canadian Ice Service (CIS). The CID holds 63 546 records covering the period from ice season 1822-23 to 2000-01. An analysis of the database allows one to trace the temporal evolution of the ice networks. The freeze-up/break-up network of 2000-01 only represents 4% of what it was in 1985-86. A drastic decline of the ice thickness and the snow on ice network is also observable. In 1997-98, it represented only 10% of the network that existed in 1984-85. The major budget cuts in Canadian government agencies during the late 1980s and the 1990s offer the most plausible explanation for the drastic decline in the ice observation networks. Weekly ice coverage determination on large lakes from satellite imagery by the CIS and the national volunteer ice monitoring program, IceWatch, may provide a means of reviving, at least, the freeze-up/break-up network.

J	Warnken, KW; Santschi, PH				Warnken, KW; Santschi, PH			Biogeochemical behavior of organic carbon in the Trinity River downstream of a large reservoir lake in Texas, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations were measured and annual loads estimated for the Trinity River, the main freshwater input source to Galveston Bay, which lies on the upper Gulf coast of Texas, USA, during 2000-2001. This river drains the forested lowlands south of a relatively large reservoir lake, Lake Livingston. A weak relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Q(TR) indicated hydrologic control but separation of the data, based on individual discharge events, was necessary to improve interpretation. For instance, the first rain of the season resulted in only a modest increase in DOC concentrations and led to an inverse relationship with discharge, due to decreased lateral flow and increased infiltration of rainwater, with the lower flows being more efficient at DOC leaching from soils. In contrast, a long duration high discharge river crest event resulted in an opposite trend, i.e. a linear increase in DOC with increasing discharge rates. A short duration high discharge tropical storm showed reduced Trinity River DOC concentrations and the highest POC concentrations measured, likely resulting from the relatively short duration, and minimal contact time, of this event. In contrast to DOC, the concentrations of particulate organic carbon, POC (mg C l(-1)) were linearly correlated to suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations and accounted for between 10 and 12% of the total suspended load at low discharge but decreased to similar to2% at high discharge. This suggests dilution by larger particles with a reduced organic carbon content, possibly silicate minerals, more readily resuspended at elevated levels of discharge. The annual total organic carbon (TOC) load to Galveston Bay, estimated from the slope of the daily load vs. discharge relationship, was 11.2 x 10(10) g C and calculated export coefficients (g C m(-2) year(-1)) were in good agreement with previous results. Using this relationship, accurate assessments of TOC flux inputs to Galveston Bay over the past quarter-century and in the future are possible by obtaining annual Trinity River discharge rates, which are readily available from the USGS. Comparing DOC riverine inputs to benthic sources in Trinity Bay, measured directly on the same day, indicates that the sediments contribute approximately 20% of total inputs of DOC to Trinity Bay. However, assuming a constant benthic source during low-flow conditions, which can occur for periods of up to 14 months in this region of Texas, benthic fluxes would account for >80% of the total inputs into Trinity Bay. At high levels of discharge, the Trinity River discharges similar to1.0 x 10(9) g C day(-1) and dominates DOC inputs to Trinity Bay. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Collins, AL; Walling, DE; Leeks, GJL				Collins, AL; Walling, DE; Leeks, GJL			Use of composite fingerprints to determine the provenance of the contemporary suspended sediment load transported by rivers	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Sediment fingerprinting appears to offer a valuable alternative to direct monitoring for elucidating the provenance of suspended sediment and the relative importance of spatial zones or subcatchments comprising larger (>500km(2)) drainage basins. Against this background, a quantitative composite fingerprinting technique, incorporating both statistically verified multicomponent signatures and a multivariate sediment-mixing model, has been employed to determine the spatial origin of contemporary suspended sediment transported from the upper and middle reaches of the River Exe (601km(2)) and River Severn (4325km(2)) basins, UK. Spatial origin is addressed in terms of the relative contribution from three distinct geological subareas constituting each study basin. The consistency of the composite fingerprinting approach is examined using the estimates for mean and seasonal variations in source area contributions and also a comparison between the results obtained for individual flood events and alternative lines of evidence provided by flood travel times and the spatial distribution of precipitation. It is argued that fingerprinting estimates for sediment provenance are consistent with existing information on suspended sediment yields from different subcatchments within the study basins, although in the Severn, the role of storage and remobilization in producing signature 'averaging' may complicate comparison of the fingerprinting data with typical floodwater routing times. Validation represents the greatest problem for the cost-benefit of fingerprinting and scope still exists for further refinement of the procedures involved. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Hama, T; Nakamura, K; Kawashima, S				Hama, Takehide; Nakamura, Kimihito; Kawashima, Shigeto			Effectiveness of cyclic irrigation in reducing suspended solids load from a paddy-field district	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The reduction of suspended solids, nutrients, and organic matter loads in drainage water from paddy fields is an important issue for water quality management in closed water areas in Japan. We evaluated the ability of cyclic irrigation to reduce the suspended solids load from paddy fields. In 2006 and 2007, we investigated water and mass balances during the irrigation period in a low-lying paddy-field district neighboring Lake Biwa, which is the largest lake in Japan. We confirmed that cyclic irrigation reduced effluent loads during the puddling season. With cyclic irrigation, 118 kg ha(-1) of suspended solids was returned to the paddy fields in 2006 and 199 kg ha(-1) in 2007. The effect of cyclic irrigation on the net suspended solids load can be represented by three ratios: the concentration ratio, which represents the ratio of the suspended solids concentration in drainage water to that in lake water; the cyclic irrigation ratio, which represents the ratio of the volume of reused water to that of irrigation water in cyclic irrigation: and the surplus irrigation water ratio, which represents the ratio of the volume of surplus irrigation water to that of irrigation water. The cyclic irrigation ratio and the surplus irrigation water ratio interact to determine the effect of cyclic irrigation on the net suspended solids load. Simultaneously increasing the cyclic irrigation ratio and decreasing the surplus irrigation water ratio will maximize the purification effect on drainage water from paddy fields.

Partitioning impacts of climate and regulation on water level variability in Great Slave Lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water level observations and a daily water balance model are used to build a naturalized water level history for Great Slave Lake dating back to the 1967 completion of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam in the Peace River basin headwaters. Comparison of water level observations dating back to 1938 and water balance scenarios for 1964-1998 assist in constraining the probable magnitude and likely direction of climate and regulation impacts on the water level history of the lake. Overall, the first-order analysis suggests that the effect of flow regulation has been to dampen annual water level variability by about 20 +/- 2 cm, to reduce annual maximum water Levels by about 14 +/- 3 cm and to shift peak water levels earlier in the season by about 30 +/- 8 days. Meanwhile, climate forcing has tended to enhance water level variability by 8 +/- 2 cm, to enhance maximum water levels by 10 +/- 3 cm and to advance the timing of maximum water levels slightly (11 +/- 8 days). Climatic and regulation impacts appear to have generally counter-balanced changes in amplitude of water level changes and magnitude of peak levels but have cumulatively contributed to a seasonal shift toward earlier peak water levels in the lake.

This study primarily aimed at decoding population structure of wild walleye (Sander vitreus) populations of Mistassini Lake (Quebec, Canada) in order to define source populations to be used for the study of spatial partitioning using individual-based multilocus assignment methods, and decipher the dynamics of individual dispersal and resulting patterns of spatial resource partitioning and connectivity among populations. A second objective was to elucidate the relationships between biological characteristics (sex, size, age and population of origin) and an individual's probability to migrate and/or disperse. To do so, a total of 780 spawning individuals caught on five distinct spawning sites, and 1165 postspawning individuals, captured over two sampling seasons (2002-2003) were analysed by means of eight microsatellite loci. Four temporally stable walleye populations associated with distinct reproductive grounds were detected. These populations were differentially distributed among lake sectors during their feeding migration and their spatial distribution was stable over the two sampling seasons. Dispersing individuals were identified (n = 61); these revealed asymmetrical patterns of dispersal between populations, which was also confirmed by divergent admixture proportions. Regression models underlined population of origin as the only factor explaining differential dispersal of individuals among populations. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that larger individuals tended to migrate from their river of origin further away in the lake relative to smaller fish. In summary, this study underlined the relevance of using individual-based assignment methods for deciphering dynamics of connectivity among wild populations, especially regarding behavioural mechanisms such as differential spatial partitioning and dispersal responsible for the maintenance of genetic population structure.					; Dupont, Pierre/LZG-9197-2025	Bourret, Vincent/0000-0002-8198-2952; Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709													0962-1083					MAR	2007	16	5					937	951		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03205.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03205.x								17305852					WOS:000244245300003
J	O'Reilly, CM				O'Reilly, CM			Seasonal dynamics of periphyton in a large tropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Tropical aquatic systems are generally assumed to have little seasonality in productivity patterns. However, this study indicated that there was substantial seasonal variation in epilithic productivity and biomass in tropical Lake Tanganyika, due primarily to seasonal patterns in lake hydrodynamics that influence nutrient availability. Although they support much of the lake's biological diversity, epilithic algae made a minor contribution to the total energy budget in Lake Tanganyika. A comparison among large, oligotrophic lakes revealed no significant latitudinal trends in periphyton productivity or biomass. However, Lake Tanganyika has relatively low benthic algal biomass and is therefore more efficient at photosynthesis than the temperate lakes. The influence of wave action and consumer density and diversity may be important in moderating productivity of the epilithic community.					; O'Reilly, Catherine/AFZ-5813-2022	O'Reilly, Catherine/0000-0001-9685-3697; 													0018-8158					JAN	2006	553						293	301		10.1007/s10750-005-0878-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-0878-x													WOS:000233730900022

This study presents the analysis of spectral signatures from kettle holes based on in situ water sampling and reflectance measurements in application for chlorophyll estimation. Water samples and surface reflectance from kettle holes were collected from 6 ponds in 15 field campaigns (5 in 2007 and 10 in 2008), resulting in a total of 80 spectral datasets. We assessed the existing semi-empirical algorithms to determine chlorophyll content for different types of kettle holes using seasonal and cross-seasonal volume reflectance and derivative spectra. Based on this analysis and optical properties of water leaving reflectance from kettle holes, the following typology of the remote signal interpretation was proposed: Submerged vegetation, Phytoplankton dominated and Mixed type.					; Lennartz, Bernd/M-3823-2019	Bill, Ralf/0000-0001-5520-5271; Lennartz, Bernd/0000-0003-3020-7312													2072-4292					NOV	2012	4	11					3481	3500		10.3390/rs4113481	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs4113481													WOS:000313914500012

This study was conducted to evaluate patterns in a 19-year record of global satellite observations of vegetation phenology from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) as a means to characterize major ecosystem disturbance events and regimes. The fraction absorbed of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) by vegetation canopies worldwide has been computed at a monthly time interval from 1982 to 2000 and gridded at a spatial resolution of 8-km globally. Potential disturbance events were identified in the FPAR time series by locating anomalously low values (FPAR-LO) that lasted longer than 12 consecutive months at any 8-km pixel. We can find verifiable evidence of numerous disturbance types across North America, including major regional patterns of cold and heat waves, forest fires, tropical storms, and large-scale forest logging. Summed over 19 years, areas potentially influenced by major ecosystem disturbances (one FPAR-LO event over the period 1982-2000) total to more than 766,000 km(2). The periods of highest detection frequency were 1987-1989, 1995-1997, and 1999. Sub-continental regions of the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Central Canada had the highest proportion (> 90%) of FPAR-LO pixels detected in forests, tundra shrublands, and wetland areas. The Great Lakes region showed the highest proportion (39%) of FPAR-LO pixels detected in cropland areas, whereas the western United States showed the highest proportion (16%) of FPAR-LO pixels detected in grassland areas. Based on this analysis, an historical picture is emerging of periodic droughts and heat waves, possibly coupled with herbivorous insect outbreaks, as among the most important causes of ecosystem disturbance in North America.

J	Hansson, LA				Hansson, LA			Induced pigmentation in zooplankton: a trade-off between threats from predation and ultraviolet radiation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is harmful to all life, and the ongoing depletion of the ozone layer is likely to affect interactions among both terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Some organisms have evolved adaptations to reduce radiation damage, such as the various types of protective pigmentation of freshwater zooplankton. However, strong pigmentation also increases vulnerability to visually hunting predators. Hence, where both UV radiation and predation are intense, zooplankton may be sandwiched between conflicting selective pressures: to be pigmented and to be transparent at the same time. Here, I show that the level of pigmentation in copepods is up to ten times higher in lakes without predatory fishes than where fishes are present, Moreover, animals from the same population exposed to either UV light or predator scent showed a 10% difference in pigmentation after only four days, suggesting that pigmentation is an inducible trait. Hence, individual copepods are not passive victims of selective predation or radiation damage, but adjust the level of pigmentation according to the prevailing threat. The ability to adjust pigmentation level rapidly may be especially useful in situations where risk assessment is difficult due to strong seasonal and spatial variation in risk variables, such as in Arctic regions. With progressive thinning of the ozone layer, the ability of some but not other organisms to adjust protection against UV radiation may lead to counter-intuitive, large-scale alterations in freshwater food webs.

High Lytic Infection Rates but Low Abundances of Prokaryote Viruses in a Humic Lake (Vassiviere, Massif Central, France)	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We explored the abundance and infection rates of viruses on a time series scale in the euphotic zone of the humic mesotrophic Lake Vassiviere (Massif Central, France) and compared them to nonhumic lakes of contrasting trophy (i.e., the oligomesotrophic Lake Pavin and the eutrophic Lake Aydat) located in the same geographical region and sampled during the same period. In Lake Vassiviere, the abundances of virus-like particles (range, 1.7 x 10(10) to 2.6 x 10(10) liter(-1)) were significantly (P < 0.001) lower than in Lakes Pavin and Aydat. The percentage of virus-infected prokaryotic cells (mean, 18.0%) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in Vassiviere than in Pavin (mean, 11.5%) and Aydat (mean, 9.7%). In Vassiviere, the abundance of prokaryotes was a good predictor (r = 0.78, P < 0.001) of the number of virus-like particles, while the potential grazing rate from heterotrophic nanoflagellates was positively correlated to the viral infection rate (r = 0.75, P < 0.001; n = 20), indicating the prevalence of cycling interactions among viruses, prokaryotes, and grazers, which is in agreement with past experiments. The absence of correlation between chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl) and viral parameters suggested that the resources for the lytic activity of viruses in Vassiviere were mainly under allochthonous control, through host activity. Indeed, compilation of data obtained from several nonhumic lakes in the French Massif Central revealed that Chl was positively correlated to the abundance of virus-like particles at concentrations above 0.5 mu g Chl liter(-1) and negatively at concentrations below 0.5 mu g Chl liter(-1), suggesting that phytoplankton-derived resources could force prokaryotic growth to attain a certain threshold level when the host availability is sufficient to boost the proliferation of viruses. Therefore, based on the high level of lytic infection rates in Lake Vassiviere, we conclude that viruses are key agents for prokaryotic mortality and could influence the food web dynamics in humic lakes, which may ultimately depend on the internal cycling of resources and, perhaps, mainly on the allochthonous inputs and the associated humic substances.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Rasconi, Serena/0000-0001-6667-8904; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803													0099-2240	1098-5336				AUG	2011	77	16					5610	5618		10.1128/AEM.01370-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01370-10								21724889					WOS:000293504400007

J	Ludovisi, A; Pandolfi, P; Taticchi, MI				Ludovisi, A; Pandolfi, P; Taticchi, MI			The strategy of ecosystem development: specific dissipation as an indicator of ecosystem maturity	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												The ratio of entropy generation rate to entropy embodied in structures relatively to the surroundings can be considered as an indicator of the ability of a self-organizing dissipative system to maintain itself far from equilibrium by pumping out entropy. The higher the ratio (which may be called the specific entropy production or the specific dissipation of a system), the lower the capacity of a system to convert the incoming low-entropy energy into internal organization. It appears that the ratio attains special significance for interpreting the evolution of biological systems, as the maximum expression of self-organizing systems, from the sub-cellular to the ecosystem scale. This paper proposes specific dissipation, written as the ratio of biological entropy production to exergy stored in the living biomass, as a thermodynamic orientor as well as an indicator of the development state of ecological systems. After having presented a method for estimating the specific dissipation in lakes, the adequacy of the proposed indicator is discussed and also tested by comparing its response to those of some classical ecological attributes (successional sequences of species, biodiversity, individual body size, structural organization and generation time of organisms) throughout the seasonal progression of the plankton community in Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy). The results support the hypothesis that the minimization of specific dissipation is a primary criterion of evolution of ecological systems and also sustain the use of specific dissipation as an indicator of ecological maturity.

Here, we compared the composition of six trophic variables from three trophic levels in a deep oligotrophic lake within temporal (diel and seasonal) and spatial (horizontal and vertical) sampling resolutions. Mean values and ratios between the variables were compared between day and night, in three sampling months, four lake basins, and three water depths. Factor analysis was used to determine abiotic variables which may explain the heterogeneous distribution of the trophic variables. All six trophic variables were strongly heterogeneously distributed between the sampling months and the water depths, whereas horizontal and day-night differences were lower. Distribution of fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton correlated with water temperature and nutrient concentrations. Accordingly, for the use in comparative and meta-analyses, singular sampling programs in deep lakes have to integrate the entire water depth and are best repeated over several seasons. Alternatively, mean water temperature and nutrient concentrations may be used as covariates to diminish the unexplained variance between samples from different lakes.

Composed of two sub-reservoirs with contrasted water inputs, the Pe (n) over tildea Larga dam provides the opportunity to better constrain C budgets and source - composition of suspended organic matter within two parts of a unique freshwater system with contrasted redox conditions. The redox status is reflected by drastic differences between the two parts of the reservoir, pictured by water residence time, water column ventilation, dissolved trace element concentration and suspended organic matter composition. Seasonal renewal of water near the main inlet supports higher surface productivity, oxic water column conditions, homogenous water chemical composition and, below the thermocline, the transport of suspended organic matter mainly derived from soil erosion on the watershed. Calculated sediment and organic C storages amount to 5.6 x 10(6) t a(-1) and 21 +/- 5 x 10(3) t C a(-1), respectively. Despite a markedly lower suspended sediment load, Outflow waters exhibit POC-delta(13)C values similar to those in inflow waters, due to a short water residence time and a rapid recycling of primary products. In the more isolated parts of the reservoir, where water discharge is thoroughly reduced, hypoxic to anoxic conditions are found immediately below the thermocline (ca. 16 m, [O-2]<30 mumol L-1). They induce a correlative increase of trace element concentrations with water depth. Suspended organic matter display C-13-depleted compositions, contrasting sharply with that of photosynthetic organisms and land-derived detritus, that either reflect the contribution of microbial biomass (chemoautotrophic and/or methanotrophic bacteria) or the selective degradation of more labile organic compounds in the water column. The hypoxic to anoxic conditions displayed in the major part of the water column extend to the first cm of lake bottom sediments. A simplified budget based on the main redox processes active in the hypolimnion and on average water residence times, supports drastic differences in mineralization rate: 83-444 mumol C L-1 a(-1) for the oxic reservoir and only 43 mumol C L-1 a(-1) for the hypoxic to anoxic reservoir. This study shows that, if water renewal is not sufficient, tropical freshwater lakes may be subject to severe dissolved O-2 depletion conditions at shallow depths, comparable to those observed in deep sections of the water column of temperate eutrophic lakes.

Salmonid pellet feed consists of primarily marine-derived material and thus exhibits carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic compositions distinct to most freshwater organic material. Comparison of the isotopic ratios of organisms at the cage site with an unaffected control site, supports incorporation of pellet-derived material to the diet of planktonic and benthic communities. Moreover, after allowing for a number of trophic transfers, stable isotope analyses revealed the predatory cladoceran Leptodora kindti also utilised pellet material, while roach were probably short-circuiting the food chain by directly consuming particulate pellet material, as well as via ingestion of their zooplankton prey. Isotope data substituted into a simple two-source mixing model suggested that approximately 65% of Daphnia, and >80% of roach body carbon may be derived from pellet material in the plankton, and that chironomid larvae may incorporate >50% in the sediment environs. However, contributions calculated from both delta(13)C and delta(15)N values were inconsistent, which may simply be due to the constraints of the model and parameters used, but may also reflect different routing of isotopes from the original pellet source, via soluble or particulate routes.

J	Stewart, KA; Lamoureux, SF				Stewart, Kailey A.; Lamoureux, Scott F.			Seasonal and microhabitat influences on diatom assemblages and their representation in sediment traps and surface sediments from adjacent High Arctic lakes: Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The spatial (i.e. microhabitat) and temporal (i.e. seasonal) characteristics of diatom assemblages in adjacent High Arctic lakes were studied intensively June-August 2004. These baseline data are used to improve understanding of modern diatom community dynamics, as well to inform paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Diatoms were collected approximately weekly through the melt season from each principal benthic substrate (moss/macrophyte, rock scrapes, littoral sediment), plankton, and sediment traps, and were compared to the uppermost 0.5 cm of a surface core obtained from the deepest part of the lake where sediment cores are routinely collected. Water samples were collected concurrently with diatom samples to investigate species-environment relationships. The lakes share approximately half of their common taxa, the most abundant overall in both lakes being small Cyclotella species. Results of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indicate that the largest gradient in species turnover existed between benthic and planktonic communities in both lakes, and that sediment trap and the surface core top samples most closely resemble the planktonic assemblage, with an additional contribution from the lotic environment. Our results indicate clear micro-spatial controls on species assemblages and a degree of disconnection between the benthos and deep lake sediments that manifests as an under-representation of benthic taxa in deep lake surface sediments. These findings are particularly relevant in the context of interpreting the paleoenvironmental record and assessing ecosystem sensitivity to continued climate change.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2012	683	1					265	286		10.1007/s10750-011-0965-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0965-0													WOS:000299925200019

Variations in the macrobenthic invertebrates in relation to physico-chemical characteristics and WQI in Lake Qarun, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The seasonal relationship between the physico-chemical characteristics and the macrobenthic fauna community was studied in Lake Qarun, Egypt. Lake Qarun receives a huge amount of agricultural drainage water from the neighboring cultivated land via El-Batts and El-Wadi drains. Generally, the obtained results have shown a decrease in dissolved oxygen, transparency and increase in COD, NO3- and NH3 at the stations in front of El-Batts and El-Wadi drains due to the continuous pollutants discharged into the Lake's water. The WQI revealed that the water quality of Lake Qarun is poor for aquatic life. The macrobenthic community consisted of sixteen species belonging to three phyla, Mollusca (7 species) that was dominated by Cerastoderma glaucum, Annelida (4 species) that was dominated by Limnodrillus spp. and Arthropoda (5 species) that was dominated by Balanus pallidus. The structure and abundance of macrobenthic species were affected by many factors especially pollution from the drainage water contaminated with sewages, which affected all living organisms in the Lake. The WQI values of Lake Qarun ranged from 32.30 to 38.40 (poor class) and the average value in the whole area was 35.89 +/- 1.64 that is ranked as poor for the aquatic life utilization. To avoid this undesirable effect, the pollutants that flow into the Lake must be treated before being discharged.(c) 2022 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

Soil and sediment samples were taken at the surface and at different depths up to 9 cm. Fresh samples and acidified controls (1-3 g dry wt.) were slurried with local water and incubated in the dark at 25-28 degrees C for 3 days with 0.5-1.6 mu g Hg g(-1) (dry wt.) added as (HgCl2)-Hg-203. CH3 Hg-203 was extracted and measured in scintillation cocktail after acid leaching. Methylmercury production varied by orders of magnitude among sites and among sediment or soil layers. Seasonal variations were smaller than those with sample depth and location. In both seasons, MeHg formation in sediment and soil or flooded soil decreased with depth and was, in the top layers, one order of magnitude higher in the C-rich littoral macrophyte zone (2.3-8.9%) and flooded forest (3.2-4.5%) than in the center of the lake (0.2-0.56%). Similar MeHg production was found in slurried dry soils (dry season) and in soils already flooded for months. In the macrophyte zone soil (dry season), methylation was mainly associated with the thin Paspalum sp. rootlet layer. In the forest site, vertical variation in methylation was less pronounced in flooded than in dry soils and during the inundation the higher methylation rate was found in the flocculent sediment settled over the litter layer. The roots of floating Paspalum sp. were an important Hg methylation site, particularly those heavily colonized with periphyton (3.4-5.4%). Methylation in surface or near-bottom water was undetectable (< 3 x 10(-2)%) at all sites. Flooded forests and macrophyte mats are specific features of the Amazon and are important links between Hg inputs from natural and manmade sources and MeHg exposure of local populations through fish intake.

Data presented in this paper include geochemical characteristics of various kinds of water (mine, surface and groundwater) and of suspended-particle samples in the vicinity of Balya. The more polluted mine waters have low pH and high conductivity, while high concentrations of Zn, Cd, Mn tend to be found in the dry and wet seasons. High concentrations of Pb, As, Cr, Cu and S appear only in the wet season. The sources of the heavy metal concentration within the Kocacay River are leached waste, surface run off, and overflow from the spillway of the WRD. To minimize the formation of acids and dissolved metal, and for the remediation of the harmful effects of extreme contamination conditions, it is recommended that lime or alkali materials and organic carbon be added to simulate the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria.					; Kumral, Mustafa/ABF-7616-2020; Tutay, Yüksel/ABB-5467-2020; KUMRAL, Mustafa/ABF-7616-2020; Budakoglu, Murat/ABB-3058-2020	Orgun, Yuksel/0000-0002-5422-2739; Budakoglu, Murat/0000-0003-1533-2457; KUMRAL, Mustafa/0000-0001-7827-8721; 													0943-0105					DEC	2003	45	2					198	208		10.1007/s00254-003-0866-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-003-0866-2													WOS:000188238800006

Depending on the amount and frequency of wastewater input, physico-chemical characteristics of pond, species richness, predator prey interactions and pond wise different piscicultural practices, the amount of carbon sequestration varied spatially. Significant temporal variations were also observed in each trophic level of these three selected East Kolkata Wetland pond ecosystems. On average primary producers were sequestered 2038.6 +/- 244.8mg C m(-3) d(-1) whereas 307 +/- 19.3mg C m(-3) and 11531.4 +/- 318.2mg C m(-3) was sequestered by primary and secondary consumers, respectively. In Kolkata and its nearby districts over 90% of the production was marked from the East Kolkata Wetland area. Consequently, a significant amount of sequestered carbon was exported from the East Kolkata Wetland ecosystem in the form of fish and this continuous system might increase the carbon sequestration efficiency of the aquatic ecosystem.																			0254-8704					SEP	2016	37	5					965	971											29251883					WOS:000383311800015
J	Srifa, A; Phlips, EJ; Hendrickson, J				Srifa, Akeapot; Phlips, Edward J.; Hendrickson, John			How many seasons are there in a sub-tropical lake? A multivariate statistical approach to determine seasonality and its application to phytoplankton dynamics	LIMNOLOGICA												Seasonal patterns in factors that affect primary producers are an important part of defining the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. However, defining seasonality is often more difficult in aquatic than in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in subtropical and tropical environments. In this study, a long-term data set for a shallow subtropical lake (Lake George, Florida, USA) was used to investigate seasonality using a range of physical, chemical and hydrological parameters. K-means cluster analysis of monthly averages among 11 selected environmental factors across 18 years suggested the overall annual pattern consists of three different seasonal clusters: a cold season (January-April), a warm season (May-August) and a flushing season (September-December). High dissolved oxygen and increased Secchi depth are key features of the cold season, while the warm season is characterized by high mean light irradiances, temperature, rainfalls, total nitrogen and phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a level). The flushing season is characterized by high river discharge rates and high levels of dissolved nutrients and colored organic matter. Multiple response permutation procedures indicated that these seasonal cluster arrangements were significantly different than randomly permuted clusters (A-statistics=0.3314, significance of delta = 0.0160, based on 1000 permutations). Results from principal component analyses supported the presence of the three seasons in the lake. Linear models explaining chlorophyll a levels using the 3-season system generally indicated better ratios of explained variance compared to the models without seasonal alignments, further indicating that even for sub-tropical systems defining seasons provides a better understanding of phytoplankton dynamics. The approaches used in this study provide statistically based multivariate tools for the definition of seasonality in aquatic ecosystems. The ability to accurately define seasons is a key step in modeling the structure and dynamics of aquatic ecosystem, which is essential to the development of effective management strategies in a rapidly changing world.

The dual synchronizing influences of precipitation and land use on stream properties in a rapidly urbanizing watershed	ECOSPHERE												Conversion of natural ecosystems to urbanized land cover dominated by impervious surfaces can alter hydrologic delivery of terrestrially derived materials to aquatic ecosystems. By changing hydrologic regimes, urbanization has important ramifications for water quality, particularly when considering how land use change might interact with other potential environmental stressors. Here, we analyzed a suite of physical, chemical, and biological time series (2007-2008) in 11 streams in a rapidly urbanizing watershed to determine how spatiotemporal synchrony is structured in urban vs. rural stream ecosystems. We further assessed how a doubling of seasonal precipitation influenced the landscape-level stream synchrony patterns between years via changes to the local hydrologic regime. Consistent with existing theory and observations, physical variables (i.e., water temperature, flow rate) regulated by external climate features operating at broad spatial scales were more synchronous than the variables associated with fluxes of dissolved solutes (i.e., conductivity, salinity, dissolved nutrients), which are typically controlled by local and internal ecosystem processes. Both urbanization and increased precipitation modified synchrony patterns by increasing the temporal coherence of water flow and the concentration of certain dissolved solutes (i.e., conductivity, salinity). Urban streams exposed to more precipitation exhibited the greatest similarity in physicochemical conditions, suggesting an interaction among the dual stressors of precipitation and urbanization to instill ecosystem synchrony. These results suggest that taking a spatially explicit perspective in understanding urbanization and its interactions with a changing climate is critical for the future management of aquatic resources in highly developed landscapes.

The substrate displayed most significant effects on the suspended matter (P < 0.01), with the reduction of 76%-87% and 52%-63% for R australis, and 83%-86% and 45%-62% for T orientalis in gravel substrate and sediment substrate, respectively. Both species and substrates significantly decreased the N and P concentrations of water body (P < 0.01). R australis showed higher total N and P concentrations in tissues than T orientalis and had a greater potential to remove nutrients from the lake. Phosphate was easily to concentrate in the belowground tissues, while nitrate concentration was higher in leaf and stalk. Therefore, harvesting the aboveground tissues could take most of nitrate out of the sediment. The saturate photosynthetic rate (A(sat)) of P. australis was higher than that of T orientalis when grown in sediment substrate. But instance water-use-efficiency (WUEi) (A/E) and intrinsic water use efficiency (A/g(s)) showed the maximum values of two species grown in river water. With significant difference in g, however, intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) had no obvious difference in two species which indicated that high A(sat) value of R australis might result from the increased carboxylation capacity of the mesophyll, because of the central role of N in photosynthetic enzymes. Our findings suggest that the plants could absorb most of nitrogen in polluted water, while gravel displayed a high capacity for absorbing the suspended matters and phosphate salts. Therefore, biological and physiological pathways for pollutant removal should be integrated.

FY-4A is the first of a new generation of Chinese geostationary satellites, and the detection product of the satellite has not been extensively validated. Therefore, it is important to conduct a comprehensive assessment of this product. In this study, the performance of the FY-4A LST product in the Hunan Province was authenticity tested with in situ measurements, triple collocation analyzed with reanalysis products, and impact analyzed with environmental factors. The results confirm that FY-4A captures LST well (R = 0.893, Rho = 0.915), but there is a general underestimation (Bias = -0.6295 degrees C) and relatively high random error (RMSE = 8.588 degrees C, ubRMSE = 5.842 degrees C). In terms of accuracy, FY-4A LST is more accurate for central-eastern, northern, and south-central Hunan Province and less accurate for western and southern mountainous areas and Dongting Lake. FY-4A LST is not as accurate as Himawari-8 LST; its accuracy also varies seasonally and between day and night. The accuracy of FY-4A LST decreases as elevation, in situ measured LST, surface heterogeneity, topographic relief, slope, or NDVI increase and as soil moisture decreases. FY-4A LST is also more accurate when the land cover is cultivated land or artificial surfaces or when the landform is a platform for other land covers and landforms. The conclusions drawn from the comprehensive analysis of the large quantity of data are generalizable and provide a quantitative baseline for assessing the detection capability of the FY-4A satellite, a reference for determining improvement in the retrieval algorithm, and a foundation for the development and application of future domestic satellite products.					; SONG, HAIQING/MVW-2975-2025; wang, songqi/JGE-3973-2023	chen, lei shi/0000-0001-9639-5067; Song, Haiqing/0000-0003-4296-5305; Fan, Jiazhi/0000-0002-1158-5556														2073-4433				DEC	2022	13	12							1953	10.3390/atmos13121953	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13121953													WOS:000902158200001

For further exploring the hydrodynamic behaviors and geochemical processes of groundwater during the irrigation season, groundwater samples were collected and analyzed using different techniques including classical statistics, correlation analysis, Piper diagrams, and Gibbs diagrams. The results indicated that Na+, K+, SO42- and Cl- were the main ions in groundwater, which were significantly correlated with TDS. The water-rock interaction is manifested by the precipitation of calcite and dolomite and the dissolution of rock salt and gypsum as an increase in TDS related to evaporation. In addition, the increasing complexity of hydrochemical type is caused by the rapid variation of hydrodynamic regime, irrigation and evaporation, which are subjected to the constraints of salty water intrusion from the desert salty lake and infiltration of irrigation return flow. Existing wells should limit overexploitation to halt the decline in groundwater levels and cut down irrigation water to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination and restore ecological balance in desert oasis.						lu, yudong/0000-0002-1807-5807; Huo, Aidi/0000-0002-6216-5236														2073-4441				DEC	2022	14	23							3924	10.3390/w14233924	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14233924													WOS:000896489400001

Odonata (Insecta) Larvae as the Second Intermediate Hosts of the Trematodes of Genus Plagiorchis in the Basin of Chany Lake, Western Siberia	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Trematodes of the genus Plagiorchis are widespread endoparasites with a life cycle involving several hosts. The second intermediate hosts of the trematodes of genus Plagiorchis are studied for the first time in the basin of Lake Chany in the forest-steppe zone of Western Siberia, which is crossed by the migration way of many species of aquatic and near-water birds-final hosts of these trematodes. This study was conducted in 2014-2015 in the reed beds of Lake Fadikha, which is a habitat of the first intermediate hosts of plagiorchiids: snails. Invertebrates from classes Insecta, Malacostraca, and Gastropoda, as possible second intermediate hosts of the Plagiorchiidae trematodes, are studied for the prevalence and intensity of trematode infection. Metacercariae (larvae inhabiting the second intermediate hosts) of genus Plagiorchis (P. elegans and P. multiglandularis) are found only in the insects from order Odonata. The largest portion among infected larvae is comprised of larvae of Sympetrum vulgatum (68%), followed by S. flaveolum (18%), S. sanguineum (9%), and Aeshna serrata (5%). The prevalence of the metacercariae of the detected trematode species for the four Odonata species during the study years varied from 3.3 to 45.5%; the intensity of infection varied from 2 to 4 trematodes per 1 odonate larva. Infection with metacercariae increases with the age of odonate larvae. A trend towards a positive correlation between the infection (prevalence) of the first (snails) and the second (odonate larvae) intermediate hosts is identified. A significant relationship is identified between the prevalence of metacercariae of the odonate larvae and their population density, which varies throughout the season. Seasonal changes in the infection of odonates with metacercariae of the trematodes of genus Plagiorchis are associated with the phenology of these insects. Periods of increased infection are registered just prior to the mass emergence of odonates, when the abundance of odonate larvae in the water body is the highest, and vice versa, periods of decline in infection are registered after the mass metamorphosis of odonates.

Shorefront of Chilika lagoon covers 65 km and includes barrier spit and the inlet region (three spits: south, middle, and north). Dynamics of the inlets during pre (1973-1999) and post (2000-2020) hydrological intervention period were studied based on time series satellite data. Seasonal and inter-annual spit dynamics (2009-2020) were investigated based on observed data. Results indicate depositional environment on the barrier spit and south spit while erosional environment on the middle and north spit. After the hydrological intervention period (2000-2020), the south spit enhanced by 5.37 km, resulting in northward migration of the Sipakuda inlet, while the morphological changes of the middle and the north spit were observed considerable both in spatiotemporal scale. The variability of the middle and north spit is attributed to their position on the downdrift side of the inlet leading to short supply of sediments. As a result, the width and elevation of the middle and north spit significantly decreased. Depositional environment of the barrier and south spit can be attributed to their sediment characteristics which are predominantly fine and medium. On the other hand, the erosional environment of the middle and north spit are attributed to the prevalence of coarse sediments. Significant variability in inlet position and morphology along with vulnerability of the middle and north spit are matters of concern for the lagoon environment. Therefore, the study suggests that limiting the northward growth of south spit and adopting measures to control erosion at middle and north spit as two management interventions to restore the stability along the shorefront of Chilika lagoon.					; Pradhan, Subhasis/S-6881-2019; MOHANTY, PRATAP/E-8254-2014	Sahoo, Rabindra Kumar/0000-0003-2644-3988; Pradhan, Subhasis/0000-0002-1435-5553													0276-0460	1432-1157				DEC	2022	42	4							18	10.1007/s00367-022-00741-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00367-022-00741-y													WOS:000877700300001
J	Uygun, BS; Albek, EA				Uygun, Burcu Simsek; Albek, Erdem Ahmet			Seasonal monitoring of organochlorine pesticides in water, soil, and sediment in a small pond and determining ecotoxicological risk assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT												One of the most important ways to improve quality and productivity in agriculture is to eliminate weeds, plant pathogens, and insects with pesticides. Although pesticides can effectively control agricultural quality and quantity, there are also lots of disadvantages due to their intensive usage resulting in degradation products. These products can accumulate in organisms and enter the food chain. Therefore, pesticides emanating from agricultural areas are agents that can affect the water quality of surface and groundwater sources. In this study, the presence of pesticides in the water and soil environment of the Borabey Pond and watershed which is situated north of Eskisehir, Turkey were determined by measurements. For this purpose, sediment and water samples from the pond and soil samples from the watershed were taken. The levels of organochlorine pesticides in the water, sediment and soil from Borabey Pond were determined between 0.5-13.8 ng/L, 0.03-1.02 mu g/kg, and 0.54-52 mu g/kg. Moreover, fugacity fraction has been measured that there is a transformation from water to sediment. Wilcoxon rank-sum test is done to the seasonal measurements and there is no significant difference. Meanwhile, risk quotient (risk characterization ratio) estimates for DDTs and HCHs is below 1, so risk is acceptable.

A satellite snow depth multi-year average derived from SSM/I for the high latitude regions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The hydrological cycle for high latitude regions is inherently linked with the seasonal snowpack. Thus, accurately monitoring the snow depth and the associated aerial coverage are critical issues for monitoring the global climate system. Passive microwave satellite measurements provide an optimal means to monitor the snowpack over the arctic region. While the temporal evolution of snow extent can be observed globally from microwave radiometers, the determination of the corresponding snow depth is more difficult. A dynamic algorithm that accounts for the dependence of the microwave scattering on the snow grain size has been developed to estimate snow depth from Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) brightness temperatures and was validated over the U.S. Great Plains and Western Siberia. The purpose of this study is to assess the dynamic algorithm performance over the entire high latitude (land) region by computing a snow depth multi-year field for the time period 1987-1995. This multi-year average is compared to the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase2 (GSWP2) snow depth computed from several state-of-the-art land surface schemes and averaged over the same time period. The multi-year average obtained by the dynamic algorithm is in good agreement with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient for January is 0.55). The static algorithm, which assumes a constant snow grain size in space and time does not correlate with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient with GSWP2 data for January is -0.03), but exhibits a very high anti-correlation with the NCEP average January air temperature field (correlation coefficient -0.77), the deepest satellite snow pack being located in the coldest regions, where the snow grain size may be significantly larger than the average value used in the static algorithm. The dynamic algorithm performs better over Eurasia (with a correlation coefficient with GSWP2 snow depth equal to 0.65) than over North America (where the correlation coefficient decreases to 0.29).

Change detection and environmental impacts due to water-reserve changes in Ataturk Dam Lake have been determined and evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imageries and meteorological datasets within a period of 1984-2011. These time series have been evaluated for three time periods. Dam construction period constitutes the first part of the study. Land cover/use changes especially on agricultural fields under the Ataturk Dam Lake and its vicinity have been identified between the periods of 1984-1992. The second period comprises the 10-year period after the completion of filling up the reservoir in 1992. At this period, Landsat and meteorological time-series analyses are examined to assess the impact of the Ataturk Dam Lake on selected irrigated agricultural areas. For the last 9-year period from 2002 to 2011, the relationships between seasonal water-reserve changes and irrigated plains under changing climatic factors primarily driving vegetation activity (monthly, seasonal, and annual fluctuations of rainfall rate, air temperature, humidity) on the watershed have been investigated using a 30-year meteorological time series. The results showed that approximately 368 km(2) of agricultural fields have been affected because of inundation due to the Ataturk Dam Lake. However, irrigated agricultural fields have been increased by 56.3% of the total area (1552 of 2756 km(2)) on Harran Plain within the period of 1984-2011.

J	Wang, HJ; Pan, YP; Chen, YN				Wang, Huaijun; Pan, Yingping; Chen, Yaning			Impacts of regional climate and teleconnection on hydrological change in the Bosten Lake Basin, arid region of northwestern China	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												This investigation examined effects of climate change, measured as annual, seasonal, and monthly air temperature and precipitation from 1958 to 2010, on water resources (i.e., runoff) in the Bosten Lake Basin. Additionally, teleconnections of hydrological changes to large-scale circulation indices including El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Tibetan High (XZH), westerly circulation index (WI), and northern hemisphere polar vortex area index (VPA) were analyzed in our study. The results showed the following. (1) Annual and seasonal air temperature increased significantly in the Bosten Lake Basin. Precipitation exhibited an increasing trend, while the significance was less than that of temperature. Abrupt changes were observed in 1996 in mountain temperature and in 1985 in plain temperature. (2) Runoff varied in three stages, decreasing before 1986, increasing from 1987 to 2003, and decreasing after 2003. (3) Precipitation and air temperature have significant impacts on runoff. The hydrological processes in the Bosten Lake Basin were (statistically) significantly affected by the northern hemisphere polar vortex area index (VPA) and the Tibetan High (XZH). The results of this study are good indicators of local climate change, which can enhance human mitigation of climate warming in the Bosten Lake Basin.					chen, yaning/AAN-8170-2020														2040-2244					MAR	2018	9	1					74	88		10.2166/wcc.2017.140	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2017.140													WOS:000426875600005

Special attention was given to changes in rotifers and crustaceans (cladocerans and copepods). The rotifers were grouped into three size classes (<200 mu m, 200 mu m-400 mu m, >400 mu m) to explore their size-related responses to macrophyte restoration. The results showed that during the restoration, the annual mean biomass and macrophyte coverage increased significantly from 0 to 637 g/m(2) and 0 to 27%, respectively. In response, the density and biomass of crustaceans and the crustacean-to-rotifer ratio increased significantly, while the rotifer density decreased significantly. Moreover, rotifers showed significant sizedependent responses to macrophyte restoration. Specially, rotifers <400 mu m were significantly suppressed, while those >= 400 mu m were significantly encouraged. Overall, the population of large-sized zooplankton tended to boom, while that of small rotifers was inhibited during macrophyte restoration. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed positive correlations between macrophytes and crustaceans, rotifers and COD or Chl-a, but negative correlations between macrophytes and COD or Chl-a, and between crustaceans and Chl-a. Moreover, the results indicate that increased predation on phytoplankton by large-sized zooplankton might be an important mechanism for macrophyte restoration during development of aquatic ecosystems, and that this mechanism played a very important role in promoting the formation of a clear-water state in subtropical shallow lakes.					he, feng/HOF-1989-2023														2096-5508	2523-3521				MAR	2018	36	2					376	384		10.1007/s00343-018-6192-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-018-6192-z													WOS:000431662200017

In order to evaluate such functions, which are regulated by their quantity and quality, a quantitative understanding of AHS is necessary. This study shows the seasonal and vertical changes in the AHS concentration in Lake Biwa, the largest monomictic lake in Japan, over 4 years. The concentration of dissolved organic matter carbon (DOM-C) and AHS carbon (AHS-C) ranged from 0.85-1.6 mg C/l and 0.32-0.71 mg C/l, respectively. The percentages of AHS-C in the DOM-C ranged from 32% to 65%. At all depths, the DOM-C decreased and the AHS-C slightly increased or remained at nearly the same level, suggesting that the quality of the water may have changed mainly due to changes in the composition of the organic matter. Although the AHS-C to DOM-C ratio fluctuated and had no seasonal tendency, the average AHS-C ratio increased during the 4 year monitoring period. Because AHS can influence the entire food web starting with phytoplankton, unraveling the mechanism by which they accumulate remains an important goal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Behling, H; Keim, G; Irion, G; Junk, W; de Mello, JN				Behling, H; Keim, G; Irion, G; Junk, W; de Mello, JN			Holocene environmental changes in the Central Amazon Basin inferred from Lago Calado (Brazil)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Holocene environments have been reconstructed by sedimentological, mineralogical geochemical and high resolution pollen analysis of a 1190 cm-long core from Lago Calado near Manaus in Central Amazonia. The sediment core, dated by eight AMS-radiocarbon dates, has a basal age of 8330 +/- 50 C-14 yr BP and documents the landscape development from a river valley before 8280 C-14 yr BP to a lake environment. This change is related to the rise of the Central Amazonian water level, controlled by the postglacial sea-level rise, Pollen analytical results show the formation of a local Mauritia palm-swamp along the river margin between 8280 and 7700 C-14 yr BP. At that time, highly diverse terra firme (unflooded upland) Amazon rainforest and poorly developed vdrzea/igapo (inundated) forests along the river characterized the vegetation. The expansion of varzea/igapo forests and a strong presence of aquatic plants started at 7700 C-14 Yr BP. reflecting the rise of the Amazonian water level and the formation of the Lago Calado. The occurrence of abundant Poaceae and Cyperaceac pollen in the lake sediments since 7770 C-14 yr BP, suggest both the local colonization of unflooded mud banks around the lake margin and the formation of flooding meadows. Open exposed unflooded mud areas, periodically colonized by herbs, are related to seasonal Amazonian high and low water stands. In respect to the abundance of Poaceae pollen during the early and mid Holocene, these open areas must have been large, suggesting brief annual high and extensive annual low Amazonian water stands. After 4070 C-14 yr BP the proportion of varzea/igapo forest areas was larger than before. Herbs were less abundant, probably due to the smaller area of unflooded mud banks. The Amazonian water levels must have been higher and the period of the annual high water stands was probably longer than before. Since 2080 C-14 yr BP, the largest proportion of varzea/igapo forests is recorded, reflecting the highest Amazonian water level. Herbs were rare, suggesting that open unflooded mud areas around the lake were relatively small. This may perhaps also indicate that the seasonal period of the Amazonian high water level was the longest since 2080 C-14 yr BP. The increase of Cecropia, Poaceae and Alternanthera during the last 150 yr, suggests stronger human impact on the local vegetation. Changes to higher Amazonian water levels are related to the rise of the Atlantic sea-level. Relatively short annual high water levels during the early Holocene and relatively long annual high water levels since 4070 and especially since 2080 C-14 yr BP, can be interpreted as a climate change from a drier early Holocene (with lower annual rainfall rates and longer dry periods) until 4070 C-14 yr BP to a wetter late Holocene.

In order to quantify the possible role of these reservoirs as a sink or source of nutrients and organic matter for the river system, an input/output mass-balance of suspended matter, organic carbon, inorganic nitrogen forms, phosphorus and reactive silica was established, providing reliable estimates of their retention/elimination and export. The study was carried out over 3 years (1993, 1994 and 1995) in differing hydrological conditions. The retention times varied from 0.3 to 0.8 year, depending on the reservoir and the year, but was longer in 1993 that was a drier year than 1994 and 1995, hydrologically quite similar. Regarding retention (or elimination) and export, the behaviour of the three studied reservoirs was similar. A clear loss or retention of nitrogen, phosphorus and silica was observed in the reservoirs and represented about 40% of the incoming flux of nitrate, 50% of silica, and 60% of phosphate. The retention was lower for total phosphorus than for phosphate. The reservoirs are also sites of suspended matter deposition except during the decennial drawdown, when suspended matter is exported. For inorganic nitrogen, the average amount of nitrate retained in the Seine basin reservoirs upstream from Paris is 5000 tonnes y(-1) that is almost equal to the estimated retention by deposition or denitrification in river channel sediments for the whole drainage network. The retention in the reservoirs represents about 12% of the total flux of nitrate at the outlet of the basin upstream from Paris, and 5% at the mouth of the Seine River. We also calculated inlake C, N, P, Si budgets on the basis of direct process measurements. Measurements of planktonic primary and bacterial activity production led to annual net production of 4200 and 580 tonnes of carbon, respectively. A reasonable value (450 tonnes of carbon) of grazing was calculated. Corresponding N, P, Si fluxes were drawn from appropriate C:N:P:Si ratios. Benthic fluxes were measured with bell jars. The retention of P and Si represents a small fraction of important internal fluxes of phytoplanktonic uptake and recycling, while inorganic nitrogen retention depends mostly on benthic denitrification. The behaviour of P and Si differs in that P is mainly recycled in the water column, while Si dissolution occurs at the sediment interface. Nitrogen is recycled in both the planktonic and the benthic phase.																			0168-2563					NOV	1999	47	2					119	146		10.1007/BF00994919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00994919													WOS:000082775600001

Untangling spatial and temporal variation in abundances of estuarine fish sampled with multi-mesh gillnets	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Variability at small temporal scales can confound comparisons over longer periods of time but has often been ignored in studies of marine organisms. To determine appropriate methods for sampling fish at multiple temporal scales, we used hierarchical sampling to test hypotheses about temporal and spatial variation of individual species and assemblages of fish sampled with multi-mesh gillnets in shallow and deep habitats of a coastal lake in New South Wales, Australia. The design included temporal scales of 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo and spatial scales of sites (separated by 1 km) and zones (separated by several km). Patterns of temporal variation in univariate and multivariate analyses were complex and inconsistent across the different spatial scales and between habitats. The only general pattern was that spatial variance among replicate gillnet samples in each site was larger than variance at any of the temporal scales examined. Potential mechanisms explaining the observed patterns are likely to be complex and these are considered along with the implications for sampling assemblages of fish. A lack of generality in patterns of temporal variance reinforces the need for pilot studies to identify relevant scales of variation before commencing large-scale, long-term studies of any organism.

A total of 24 water samples were collected from six sites of water system in the SOF Park in four different seasons. The results indicated that: (1) the reclaimed water directly discharged from a reclamation treatment plant near the SOF Park as influent of park had relatively low biological safety (all samples were ranked as C or D); (2) the biological safety of reclaimed water was improved greatly with the ecological reclamation treatment processes composing of artificial wetland system and followed oxidation pond system; (3) the biological safety of reclaimed water in the main lake of SOF Park kept at a health status during different seasons (all samples were ranked as A); (4) there was some certain correlation (R-2 = 0.5737) between the sum of toxicity scores and dissolved organic carbon for the studied water samples. It was concluded that the assessment method was reliable to screen the safety of reclaimed water reused as scenic water, and the reclaimed water with further ecological purification processes such as artificial wetland and oxidation pond system can be safely reused as scenic water in park.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2011	23	10					1611	1618		10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60631-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60631-6								22432255					WOS:000296036400005

Hierarchical regulation of pelagic invertebrates in lakes of the northern Great Plains: a novel model for interdecadal effects of future climate change on lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Endorheic lakes of the northern Great Plains encompass a wide range of environmental parameters (e.g., salinity, pH, DOC, Ca, nutrients, depth) that vary 1000-fold among sites and through the past 2000 years due to variation in basin hydrology and evaporative forcing. However, while many environmental parameters are known to individually influence zooplankton diversity and taxonomic composition, relatively little is known of the hierarchical relationships among potential controls or of how regulatory mechanisms may change in response to climate variation on diverse scales. To address these issues, we surveyed 70 lakes within a 100 000 km2 prairie region to simulate the magnitude of environmental change expected to occur over 100-1000 years and to quantify the unique and interactive effects of diverse environmental parameters in regulating pelagic invertebrate community structure at that scale. Multivariate analyses showed that salinity was the principal correlate of changes in invertebrate composition among lakes, with a sequential loss of taxa between salinities of 4 and 50 g total dissolved solids L-1 until one to two species predominated in highly saline systems. In contrast, changes in the concentrations of Ca2+ and other mineral nutrients exerted secondary controls of invertebrate assemblages independent of salinity, whereas lake depth provided a tertiary regulatory mechanism structuring species composition. In contrast to these large-scale hierarchical patterns, seasonal surveys (May, July, September) of a subset of 21 lakes in each of 2003-2005 revealed that annual meteorological variation had no measurable effect on pelagic invertebrates, despite large differences in temperature, precipitation, and evaporation arising from regional droughts. Together these findings show that pelagic invertebrate communities in saline lakes are resilient to interannual variability in climate, but suggest that lakes of the northern Great Plains may provide a sensitive model to forecast centennial effects of future climate change.

Although many planktic species were observed, the most frequently occurring cyanobacteria were the motile filamentous genera Oscillatoria, Phormidium, Pseudanabaena and Komvophoron. These genera represent autochtonous epipelic assemblages, occurring in upper surface layers of the sediments throughout the year and exhibiting seasonal variation in their abundancy.

Culture-based fisheries in minor perennial reservoirs in Sri Lanka: variability in production, stocked species and yield implications	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Sri Lanka is blessed with a large number of irrigation reservoirs. Depending on their hydrological regimes they are broadly categorized into perennial and seasonal reservoirs, and are secondarily used for inland fisheries. The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Sri Lanka initiated a programme to introduce culture-based fisheries in minor perennial reservoirs (< 250 ha) whereby 15 minor perennial reservoirs situated in eight administrative districts were selected for introduction of culture-based fisheries in its initial year of implementation. These reservoirs were stocked with fish fingerlings of catla Catla catla, rohu Labeo rohita, common carp Cyprinus carpio, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and post-larvae of freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Stocking commenced in 2004; stocking data from 2004, 2005 and 2006 are considered in this study. Stocking densities varied from 217 to 870 ha(-1) year(-1), with an average density of 425 ha(-1) year(-1). Fish catch statistics for 2005, 2006 and 2007 were considered; high variability in fish yield among reservoirs as well as in some reservoirs between the years were observed. Mean annual fish yield from all 15 reservoirs increased from 57.3 to 208.1 kg ha(-1) year(-1) after the introduction of culture-based fisheries. Overall fish production in all 15 reservoirs increased by 263%, ranging from 42.8 to 1344%. Overall contributions of Nile tilapia, catla, rohu, common carp and freshwater prawn to fish harvest were 47.4, 27.2, 16.9, 4.3 and 0.7%, respectively. Biomass gain per fingerling stocked with respect to catla, rohu, common carp and freshwater prawn are 0.51, 0.42, 0.26 and 0.04 kg, respectively, indicating attractive monetary gains through stocking of these species. Results indicate the viability of culture-based fisheries in minor perennial reservoirs. Possible reasons for high variability in fish yield and areas for follow-up studies are discussed.																			0175-8659					FEB	2010	26	1					99	104		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01361.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01361.x													WOS:000273821900017

Evaluating the seasonal and interannual variations in water balance in northern Wisconsin using a land surface model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We evaluated the performance of the Integrated BIosphere Simulator ( IBIS) land surface model in the temperate forests of northern Wisconsin ( 46 degrees N, 89 degrees W) to determine whether model formulations, driven with daily historical precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed data, were capable of simulating water flow and storage within a seasonally cold climate regime. We focused concurrently on understanding seasonal and interannual variations of both the water fluxes to the atmosphere and water partitioned into surface runoff and groundwater infiltration, with special attention to the transitions from cold-dominated ( snow, ice) to warm-dominated ( rain, liquid soil moisture) hydrology. Results showed when compared with a suite of field observations IBIS simulated water and energy cycling at daily to interannual timescales with reasonable accuracy. Because of errors associated with field observations, the accuracy with which we simulated each component of the water balance is not easily quantified. By investigating the complete land surface water balance, however, we increased the likelihood that all components were being captured. The modeled monthly energy balance, annual water balance, and drainage rates were generally within 5 - 15% of the observed values. Modeled and observed soil temperatures generally differed by less than 3 degrees C and had r(2) values that were greater than 0.9. Soil moisture values were within 5 - 20%, and freeze and thaw timing was within a few days of observations. Modeled snow dynamics captured the observed snow arrival and departure ( accumulation on the surface) within a few days of observations, but overestimated the average maximum depth by 86%. Because model formulations were subjected to varying soil conditions and water phases, this evaluation exercise enhanced our understanding of northern Wisconsin's water balance and increased model credibility for applications in seasonally cold climates.					; Foley, Jonathan/GRS-5522-2022	Kucharik, Christopher/0000-0002-0400-758X; Coe, Michael/0000-0002-7470-0697; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN 24	2006	111	G2							G02025	10.1029/2005JG000112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JG000112													WOS:000240992100002

However, seasonality in both fig and leaf production has been noted in almost all published phenological studies. We have addressed the following questions in the present study: (1) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies seasonal and, consequently, related to climate? (2) Does Ficus citrifolia produce ripe figs year round? (3) Is the fig development related to climate? And, (4) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies independent? By investigating these questions with a F. citrifolia population over a two-year period, at the southern edge of the tropical region in Brazil, we detected phenological seasonality that was significantly correlated with climate. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Trees became deciduous during the cold and dry months; (2) The flowering onset was asynchronous among individuals, but with moderate concentration during the hot and rainy months; (3) There was a correlation between the onset of flowering and vegetative phenology, with significantly higher crop initiations in individuals with full-leaf canopy; (4) Fig developmental time was longer in cold months; and (5) Ripe fig production occurred year-round and was not correlated with climate. Our results suggest that there are strong selection pressures that maintain the year-round flowering phenology in figs, for we have observed little seasonality in the phenology of such species despite the strong seasonality in the environment.

The upper part of the basin lies in the high altitude region of the Garhwal Himalayas and is extensively covered by glaciers. We provide hydro-meteorological insight into a severe storm that produced unusual high rains in June 2000 in the uppermost part of the Bhagirathi River. This storm was concentrated upstream of Gangotri town and triggered landslides/rockslides at several locations between the glacier snout and Gangotri town. One of the major rockslides blocked the Bhagirathi River at Bhujbas, about 3 km downstream of the Gangotri Glacier snout, creating an artificial lake at this location. High stream flow in the river, generated by rapid runoff response from mountain slopes along with melt runoff from the glacier, quickly increased the level of water stored in the artificial lake. Daily rainfall in this region rarely exceeds 10 mm, while total rainfall during this 6-day storm was 131.5 mm. This unusual rain event occurred during the tourist season in June, consequently trapping a large number of tourists and vendors in this area. Sudden release of stored water generated floods that created havoc downstream of the artificially created lake. This paper presents the hydrological and meteorological information related to such an unusual and devastating event observed in the high altitude region of the Himalayas.

Spatial and seasonal patterns in the feeding habits of juvenile Lates niloticus (L.), in the Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Flexibility in the feeding habits of juvenile Nile perch (1-30 cm total length) was studied from September 1988 to September 1989 at four sites (depth range: 1-25 m) in the Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria. During this period haplochromine cichlids were virtually absent in the area. We looked at the combined effects of predator size, season and habitat. Stomach content analysis showed that with increase in size, the diet of Nile perch shifted from zooplankton and midge larvae, to macro-invertebrates (shrimps and dragonfly nymphs) and fish. At a size of 3-4 cm Nile perch shifted from size-selective predation on the largest cyclopoids to predation on the largest, less abundant, calanoids. Zooplanktivory ended at a size of ca. 5 cm. Although an ontogenetic shift in the diet of juvenile Nile perch was obvious at all sampling stations, the contribution of prey types appeared to be habitat related. With increasing water depth the frequency of occurrence in the diet of most prey types decreased, but that of shrimps increased. At the entrance of the gulf (20-25 m deep) shrimps were the main food source throughout the year. Halfway the gulf (12-16 m), Nile perch showed seasonality in their feeding behaviour. Shrimps were taken there especially during the rainy season (January to May) when their densities at this station were high, whereas cannibalism prevailed during the rest of the year. In an environment with Nile perch and dagaa as alternative prey, shrimps were taken almost exclusively. They could be regarded as a key prey for Nile perch between 5 and 30 cm.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2006	568						121	133		10.1007/s10750-006-0033-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0033-3													WOS:000239393800010

The presence of contiguous beds of submerged (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum and Najas marina) and floating-leaved (Trapa natans) vegetation in a north Italian lake allowed us to test the effect of the different host architecture on epiphytic algae and invertebrates and to predict the consequences for the lake of changes in the predominant vegetation. 2. Epiphyton development, measured as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a (Chl a), phaeophytin and as algal and macroinvertebrate density, was significantly higher on submerged plants than on T. natans. The C:Chl a ratio, a proxy of the ratio of heterotrophs to autotrophs, was higher on the floating-leaved plants. The elemental (C:N:P) and pigment (Chl a:phaeophytin) ratios were not significantly different between the two vegetation types. 3. The taxonomic composition of epiphytic algae and invertebrates was similar on the different plants. The more varied morphology of the floating-leaved T. natans resulted in a higher diversity of epiphytic algae, however, but not of macroinvertebrates. 4. There was a significant inverse relationship between epiphyton biomass and the standing crop of the host plant, suggesting a key role for light and water exchange in epiphyton development. 5. Replacement of: floating-leaved by submerged plants would increase the total biomass of epiphytic algae and invertebrates.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1998	39	4					725	740		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00325.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00325.x													WOS:000074535600011

Space use by Great Lakes Piping Plovers during the breeding season	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Identifying and protecting breeding habitat for imperiled species requires an understanding of the spatial and temporal movements of breeding individuals. During the 2003 and 2004 breeding seasons, we examined space use by Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) in the federally endangered Great Lakes population. We used coordinate geometry to estimate home range sizes of individual birds and examined relationships between home range size and breeding stage (incubation versus chick rearing), year, sex, number of locations, minimum plover age, distance to the nearest nest, and human beach use (high, medium, or low). The mean size of home ranges of Piping Plovers that fledged at least one chick was 2.9 +/- 0.5 (SE) ha (range = 0.4-11.2 ha), and the mean linear beach distance traversed was 475 +/- 53 m (range = 130-1435 m). Individuals used 3 times more beach area and 1.5 times more shoreline distance in 2003 than in 2004. Females used smaller areas than males overall and during chick rearing. Home ranges were smallest on beaches with low public use, suggesting that human disturbance may cause greater movement by individual plovers and that larger protected areas may be warranted on beaches frequented by the public to minimize disturbance to breeding birds. Our results demonstrate that nesting Great Lakes Piping Plovers occupy relatively small ranges and, therefore, that even relatively small areas of suitable habitat can have a high conservation value for this endangered population. However, the total area of habitat used varied substantially among individuals, and this should be considered when protecting habitat for the species.

A total of 224 locations were obtained of cormorants actively diving, and presumed foraging, at the time of detection. A geographic information system was used to examine foraging distances front the nesting island, the water depth and type of substrate at preferred foraging sites, and to estimate kernel home ranges for analysis of individual foraging site fidelity. An explanatory model was developed to determine parameters affecting the distance to cormorant foraging sites. The mean distance to foraging locations of tagged cormorants from the colony site was 2,920 m (SE 180 m, max = 14,190 m), and 52% of the locations were within 2,000 m of the nesting island. No cormorant was observed making daily foraging trips to outside water bodies. Mean foraging distance was greater during morning than in the afternoon, and there was a significant effect of the time of day on distance. There was no significant effect of sex date, a seasonal measure on distance to foraging location. Individual cormorants exhibited fidelity to specific foraging sites. Most cormorants foraged in close proximity to the nesting island much of the time, while those detected further from the island tended to return repeatedly to the same locations. Ninety percent of the foraging locations were in water depths <= 7.5 m, and most were in water 2.5-5 m deep. Compositional analysis of habitat use revealed a preference for these depths, along with substrates of cobble with rubble, and silt with clay.

Temperature dependence of Fe(III) and sulfate reduction rates and its effect on growth and composition of bacterial enrichments from an acidic pit lake neutralization experiment	GEOBIOLOGY												Microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction are important electron transport processes in acidic pit lakes and stimulation by the addition of organic substrates is a strategy to remove acidity, iron and sulfate. This principle was applied in a pilot-scale enclosure in pit lake 111 (Brandenburg, Germany). Because seasonal and spatial variation of temperature may affect the performance of in situ experiments considerably, the influence of temperature on Fe(III) and sulfate reduction was investigated in surface sediments from the enclosure in the range of 4-28 degrees C. Potential Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction rates increased exponentially with temperature, and the effect was quantified in terms of the apparent activation energy E-a measuring 42-46 kJ mol(-1) and 52 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Relatively high respiration rates at 4 degrees C and relatively low Q(10) values (similar to 2) indicated that microbial communities were well adapted to low temperatures. In order to evaluate the effect of temperature on growth and enrichment of iron and sulfate-reducing bacterial populations, MPN (Most Probable Number) dilution series were performed in media selecting for the different bacterial groups. While the temperature response of specific growth rates of acidophilic iron reducers showed mesophilic characteristics, the relatively high specific growth rates of sulfate reducers at the lowest incubation temperature indicated the presence of moderate psychrophilic bacteria. In contrast, the low cell numbers and low specific growth rates of neutrophilic iron reducers obtained in dilution cultures suggest that these populations play a less significant role in Fe and S cycling in these sediments. SSCP (Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism) or DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) fingerprinting based on 16S rRNA genes of Bacteria indicated different bacterial populations in the MPN dilution series exhibiting different temperature ranges for growth.					da Silva Costa, Rodrigo/N-7274-2013; Smalla, Kornelia/AEF-8485-2022; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/E-1708-2016	da Silva Costa, Rodrigo/0000-0002-5932-4101; Boehrer, Bertram/0000-0001-6253-6634; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/0000-0002-7407-3312													1472-4677	1472-4669				OCT	2005	3	4					261	274		10.1111/j.1472-4669.2006.00065.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4669.2006.00065.x													WOS:000207172000003

Lengths of females at first maturity (SL) and 50% maturity (L-50) were estimated to be 32.2 and 37.3 mm SL, respectively. The spawning period continued throughout the year, with a peak spawning cycle from March to May 2006-2007. Observations of postovulatory follicles and tertiary yolk stage oocytes indicate that convict cichlids spawn multiple times within a year. Female cichlids that hatched during the peak spawning seasons matured after October of the same year. Batch fecundity of females (32.2-61.2 mm SL) ranged from 65 to 345 (mean +/- SD= 155 +/- 63). Opaque zones along the outer margins of otoliths formed annually. The maximum age of male and female cichlids was 3 years. The von Bertalanffy growth formulae (VBGF) were expressed as L-t = 57.4 (1-e(-078(t+0.91))) for females and L-t = 69.5 (1 - e (-1.07( t+0.24))) for males. Males grew larger than females beginning from the first year. Certain life history characteristics, such as year-round spawning and early maturation, probably contributed to the successful establishment of the convict cichlid, and this species in particular is thought to adapt and become established quickly upon introduction to freshwater systems on Okinawa-jima Island.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUL	2010	88	3					283	292		10.1007/s10641-010-9641-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-010-9641-x													WOS:000278118800010

Total fish biomass is 22.63 t km(-2) and mainly represents trophic levels (TLs) 2 and 3. The trophic food chain is relatively long and the overall transfer efficiency is quite low. Grazing foodweb based on primary producers is prominent in the reservoir ecosystem and detritus plays a less significant role. Seasonal and long-term variations in water quality have significant influences on the lower TLs clearly showing a bottom-up functioning of the ecosystem. Environmental degradations, such as siltation occurring in the lake, suggest possible risks in limiting ecosystem productivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we use stable water isotopes (delta 2H and delta 18O) in a high-elevation tropical glacial lake to inform about modern climate variability and local hydrological conditions. We report a data set of water isotopes in precipitation and lake water collected between June 2015 and November 2020 in the Chirrip ' o National Park, Costa Rica. Using a linear resistance model, the isotopic information coupled with lake water temperature and hydrometeorological data allowed the calculation of seasonal evaporation to inflow ratios (E/I) for Lake Ditkevi. Isotopic variations (delta 18O and d-excess) reflect seasonal changes in the evaporative conditions, with E/I ratios ranging from 2.7 +/- 1.3% to 10.8 +/- 5.4%. Significant correlations between lake d-excess, lake water temperature, and sea surface temperature anomalies in El Nin similar to o 3.4 region revealed the sensitive hydrological response of this high elevation tropical glacial lake to the cyclic deviations in the ocean-atmosphere domain of warm/cold El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation episodes.

A relic population of this quillwort in the Plesne jezero lake has recovered recently from a 30-year period of failure to reproduce caused by acidification. Early ontogenetic stages of the quillwort are considered to be the most vulnerable to environmental changes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the phenology of germination of I. echinospora. In a two-year experiment, we examined the time course of germination of micro- and macrospores and establishment of sporelings under (i) natural in situ conditions in the Plane jezero lake and (ii) at various temperatures (6-17 degrees C) in the laboratory. We developed a mathematical model that describes the temperature-specific temporal changes in the early ontogeny of I. echinospora. Our experiments clearly show that spores do not germinate at once but gradually over time if exposed to favourable temperatures. Generally, percentage germination tended to increase during the course of a season under most temperature regimes but was inhibited at the lowest temperature. With increasing temperature, microspores germinated earlier and more successfully than macrospores, as described by the model. Sporelings also developed faster at the higher temperature. However, the highest temperature used in the experiments (17 degrees C) desynchronized the phenology of germination in I. echinospora as it resulted in the two types of spore not being available for fertilization at the same time. Thus, climate change might affect interactions between temperature and the phenology of quillwort reproduction and threaten the survival of this species in Central Europe.

The overall mean concentrations of the heavy metals (in mu g/g dry weight) in all combined samples ranged from 0.17-0.40 (Cd), 0.47-2.53 (Pb), 2.13-8.74 (Cu), 28.9-409.3 (Zn) and 31.4-208.1 (Fe), respectively. It was found that consumption of Rastrineobola argentea can be a significant source of heavy metals especially Zn, to humans, compared with Lates niloticus and Oreochromis niloticus, if only the muscle parts of the latter two are consumed.

The flooding occurred between January and June of 2009. Samples were collected monthly from October 2008 through September 2009. After collection (at 19: 00, 01: 00, 07: 00, and 13: 00 hs) and taxonomic identification, fish were eviscerated and their stomachs preserved in a 4% formalin solution for later analysis. The diet was evaluated by the Index of Relative Importance (IRI), and temporal variations (pre-flooding, flooding, and post-flooding) in the diet were summarized by an ordination technique (DCA). The diet of T. curtus was comprised of several orders of insects and microcrustaceans. In the pre-flooding stage, more than 62% of the diet consisted of Ostracoda. In the flooding phase, T. curtus fed mainly on Chaoboridae larvae (Diptera) (44.3%) and terrestrial insects (fragments) (33.7%). In the post-flooding phase, Chaoboridae comprised 80% of the diet. These results indicate that the utilization of food resources by T. curtus was variable, changing with alterations in the availability of resources, as influenced by the hydrological cycle. The population of T. curtus proved to be opportunistic, changing its diet in the course of the hydrological cycle.

J	McCairns, RJS; Fox, MG				McCairns, RJS; Fox, MG			Habitat and home range fidelity in a trophically dimorphic pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) population	OECOLOGIA												We investigated habitat selection in a trophically dimorphic population of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) to determine whether littoral and limnetic ecotypes exhibit habitat or site fidelity. A transplant experiment was conducted, in which 998 pumpkinseeds captured from littoral and limnetic sites were marked and released in either the site of capture, the nearest site of the same habitat type, or the nearest site of the opposite habitat type. Daily recapture attempts over the course of the reproductive and growing season provided a 25% recapture rate, 40% of which were recaptured on multiple occasions at the same site. Site fidelity was very high in both ecotypes. Results estimated with a multi-state transition model indicated that the probability of a transplanted pumpkinseed returning to its site of origin ranged from 74% for limnetic pumpkinseeds released into a different limnetic or littoral site, to 93% for littoral pumpkinseeds released into a limnetic site. Furthermore, the probability of a pumpkinseed being recaptured at its site of origin if not transplanted was estimated at 97 and 98% for limnetic individuals and littoral individuals, respectively. Discriminant Function Analysis of helminth parasite loads sampled from littoral and limnetic individuals could classify site of origin with 96-100% accuracy, suggesting that the habitat and site fidelity patterns observed with mark-recapture are indicative of longterm habitat segegation of the two forms. The results of our experiment provide compelling evidence of correlated habitat selection as a function of home range fidelity within both ecotypes of a subtly dimorphic species. Such behaviour could have a significant effect on present or future gene flow.					McCairns, R.J. Scott/E-4458-2015; McCairns, R.J./E-4458-2015	McCairns, R.J.

J	Ntale, HK; Gan, TY				Ntale, HK; Gan, TY			East African rainfall anomaly patterns in association with El Nino/Southern Oscillation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												By applying harmonic analysis to El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) composites of the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and rainfall anomalies for the 1900-1996 period, and based on the 90% confidence limits established from bootstrip resampling. it was found that ENSO responses in East African rainfall are region and season dependent, and the influence of El Ni (n) over tildeo is stronger and opposite that of La Ni (n) over tildea. Among five regions of unique ENSO responses identified, northeastern (R4) and southern Tanzania (R5) seem to have the most consistent (in terms of vector coherence, percentage of variance extracted by the first harmonic, and SPI magnitude) ENSO responses. R5 experiences positive (negative) response under La Ni (n) over tildea (El Ni (n) over tildeo) influence during January and June of the post-ENSO year. Southern Uganda and much of the Lake Victoria basin show some significant positive ENSO response for November, December. and January. The temporal and regional patterns of ENSO response periods were also analyzed using the index time series and boxplots on the 6-month SPI. Boxplots confirm a shift in the distribution of 6-month SPI between ENSO and non-ENSO affected seasons.

Poland (Clethrionomys glareolus n = 459; Microtus arvalis n = 274; Apodemus flavicollis n = 209). Overall prevalence was consistently higher in the voles compared with A. flavicollis (70.6, 73.0 and 27.8% respectively for C. parvum and 93.9, 96.3 and 48.3% respectively for Giardia spp.). Prevalence and abundance of infection also varied markedly across 3 years with 1998 being a year of higher prevalence and abundance with both species. Fewer older animals (especially C. glareolus and M. arvalis) carried infection with C. parvum and infections in these animals were relatively milder. Although seasonal differences were significant, no consistent pattern of changes was apparent. Host sex did not influence prevalence or abundance of infection with C. parvum, but made a small contribution to a 4-way interaction (in 5-way ANOVA) with other factors in the case of Giardia spp. The 2 species co-occurred significantly and in animals carrying both parasites there was a highly significant positive correlation between abundance of infection with each, even with between-year, seasonal, host age, sex and species differences taken into account. Quantitative associations were confined to the 2 vole species in the study. These results are discussed in relation to the importance of wild rodents as reservoir hosts and sources of infection for local human communities.

J	Hall, CJ; Burns, CW				Hall, CJ; Burns, CW			Mortality and growth responses of Daphnia carinata to increases in temperature and salinity	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Daphnia carinata King, a freshwater cladoceran, occurs in Lake Waihola, a tidal lake with seasonal fluctuations in temperature (4-21 degreesC), and salinity (30-2000 mg L-1 Cl). We hypothesise that these fluctuations influence the seasonal changes in D. carinata abundance. 2. To test this hypothesis, adults and juveniles were exposed to combinations of temperature and salinity. We measured mortality of adults and juveniles, growth of juveniles over 20 days, and their age at first reproduction. 3. The salinity tolerance of adult D. carinata was temperature-dependent. Juveniles were more sensitive to salinity, but more tolerant of temperature increases. 4. Growth rates were higher at elevated temperatures, but reduced by elevated salinities. The onset of reproduction was earlier at elevated temperatures. 5. We conclude that seasonal changes in temperature and salinity contribute to seasonal population changes of D. carinata.																			0046-5070					MAR	2002	47	3					451	458		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00815.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00815.x													WOS:000174308400009
J	Werner, SM; Raffa, KF				Werner, SM; Raffa, KF			Effects of forest management practices on the diversity of ground-occurring beetles in mixed northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Ground-occurring Coleoptera were sampled over 2 years using pitfall traps in 23 northern hardwood or eastern hemlock-dominated sites representing even-aged, uneven-aged, or old growth forests. Overall, 65,586 individuals were obtained, representing 33 families and 192 species. Carabids comprised 54% of the total catch in 1996, when all the families were tallied. There was little variation in the number and relative abundance of carabid species caught between seasons. No differences in overall species richness or abundance were observed among forest management regimes or habitat types. However, there were substantial differences in species composition. Thirteen species showed significant habitat associations among the five forest management regimes, and 21 species were associated with specific habitat features of the sites, such as dominant tree species or canopy structure. More species (16) were affected by the presence of forest management than by tree species dominance (6) or canopy structure (5). Halpalus fulvilabris, Pterostichus coracinus, Carabus nemoralis, Glischrochilus siepmanni, Nicrophorus orbicollis, and Nicrophorus sayi were more commonly caught in managed than in old growth forest sites, while Carabus sylvosus, Platynus decentis and Oiceoptoma novaboracensis were more commonly associated with old growth sites. Calosoma frigidum and Necrophila americana were associated with northern hardwood sites, while Platynus decentis was significantly associated with sites dominated by eastern hemlock. Calosoma frigidum,, Necrophila americana, and Nicrophorus vespilloides were more common in even-aged sites, while a lampyrid and a leiodid morphospecies were more common in sites with an uneven-aged canopy structure. The importance of microsite features was reflected in the high variability observed among sites and among traps within sites. Results indicate that conservation of a range of forest types is required in order to maintain the diversity of ground-occurring beetles on a regional scale. This will be quite challenging, since forest types such as old growth hemlock-hardwood are rare across the landscape due to habitat fragmentation and logging. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A high-resolution climate history of geochemical and biological proxies from a tropical freshwater wetland located in the Kenyan Rift Valley	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The sedimentary and biological material preserved in wetlands in semi-arid regions provide a rich repository of paleoclimate and paleoecological archives. These records reflect an underutilized, but typically ignored paleoenvironmental resource in semi-arid settings. The results presented here demonstrate that groundwater-fed wetlands constitute a valuable record of environmental change that not only complement reconstructions from lacustrine settings, but also contribute unique data and insights into climate and landscape change. We use data obtained from sediment cores collected from Loboi wetland, a groundwater-fed wetland located in the Equatorial East African Rift Valley of Kenya, to demonstrate the value of paleoenvironmental datasets extracted from wetland archives. This article relates surficial sedimentary geochemical data (TOC, delta C-13, delta N-15, C:N, and %C3) at Loboi to the extant macrophytic vegetation. The surficial data are used as an analog to interpret the geochemical signature of three sediment cores and a soil pit. The stratigraphic records show significant variation along a north to south transect through the wetland. The geochemistry indicates that papyrus wetland records are distinctly different from Typha dominated wetland sedimentary signatures. The interpretation of the stratigraphic material is further improved by the inclusion of sub-fossil macrophyte and testate amoebae remains. The extraction and identification of seeds of wetland plants from the sedimentary archive provide invaluable genus to species specific details of wetland ecology. Further, the inclusion of testate amoebae as an indicator of surface hydrological conditions has significantly improved interpretation of the hydrological history of Loboi wetland. The stratigraphic record from Loboi indicates that between similar to 1100 and 1470 C.E. (Medieval Climatic Anomaly) dry conditions dominated the Loboi region, except for a brief period of wetter conditions between similar to 1275 and 1345 C.E. Seasonally wetter conditions began to persist between -1470 and 1630 C.E. Wetland sediments developed after this time as reflected by the sequestration of carbon in the sedimentary record. Recent historic biological and sedimentary proxies reflect increased agrarian impacts on the landscape surrounding Loboi.					; Muasya, Muthama/F-6628-2012	Goman, Michelle/0000-0003-1415-816X; Driese, Steven/0000-0003-2389-6391; Muasya, A.

Effects of combined sewer overflow on water quality: a case study of Hatirjheel Lake in Dhaka	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												This paper presents a case study focusing on the impacts of combined sewer overflows on the water quality of the receiving water body, Hatirjheel. Hatirjheel, the largest surface water body in Dhaka City with an area of about 1.012 km(2), receives discharges from nine combined sewer overflow (CSO) structures. The water quality of Hatirjheel is poor throughout the year, but particularly during the wet season (June to October) near the CSO structures through which significant rainwater-sewage overflows. The water has been found to contain high concentrations of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand; some of the BOD5 values exceed the national discharge standards for treated effluents. Total ammonia concentration in Hatirjheel water increases during the wet season, often exceeding 20 mg/l; the concentration continues to increase after the end of the wet season, most likely due to the ammonification process. Nitrate concentration in Hatirjheel water increases at the end of the wet season, possibly due to nitrification; subsequent reduction in nitrate and ammonia concentration is possibly due to incorporation of nitrogen into algal mass. Excessive phosphorus in Hatirjheel promotes eutrophication, resulting in the visible greenish color of the water. This study highlights the significant adverse impact of combined sewer overflows, particularly for a densely populated city like Dhaka, where most of the rainfall occurs within a relatively short period during monsoon.

Seasonal changes in cyanobacteria species and cyanometabolites composition were studied in two shallow temperate eutrophic lakes. Data on cyanobacteria biomass and diversity of dominant species in the lakes were combined with chemical and molecular analyses of fifteen potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria species (248 isolates from the lakes). Anatoxin-a, saxitoxin, microcystins and other non-ribosomal peptides formed the diverse profiles in monodominant (Planktothrix agardhii) and polidominant (Aphanizomenon gracile, Limnothrix spp. and Planktolyngbya limnetica) lakes. However, the harmfulness of the blooms depended on the ability of the dominant species to synthesize cyanometabolites. It was confirmed that P. agardhii produced a greater amount and diverse range of MCs and other NRPs. In the polidominant lake, isolates of the co-dominant A. gracile, L. planctonica and P. limnetica synthesized no or only small amounts of cyanometabolites. In general, the profile of cyanometabolites was greater in cyanobacteria isolates than in environmental samples, indicating a high potential for toxic cyanobacteria bloom.					; Koreiviene, Judita/GNM-7260-2022; Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/J-8511-2017	Sivonen, Kaarina/0000-0002-2904-0458; Paskauskas, Ricardas/0000-0003-1531-1971; Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/0000-0002-6526-4045; Koreiviene, Judita/0000-0002-8156-7548														1660-4601				NOV	2022	19	22							15341	10.3390/ijerph192215341	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215341								36430059					WOS:000887275500001

Dongting Lake wetland reserves are well known for both their intra-annual and inter-annual dynamic changes due to the effects of natural or human factors. However, most wetland monitoring research has failed to consider the seasonal wetlands, which is the most fragile wetland type, requiring more attention. In this study, we used multi-source time series remote sensing data to monitor three Dongting Lake wetland reserves between 2000 and 2020, and the seasonal wetlands were separated from permanent wetlands. Multispectral and indices time series were generated at 30 m resolution using a two-month composition strategy; the optimal features were then selected using the extension of the Jeffries-Matusita distance (J(Bh)) and random forest (RF) importance score; yearly wetland maps were identified using the optimal features and the RF classifier. Results showed that (1) the yearly wetland maps had good accuracy, and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of all wetland maps from 2000 to 2020 were above 89.6% and 0.86, respectively. Optimal features selected by J(Bh) can improve both computational efficiency and classification accuracy. (2) The acreage of seasonal wetlands varies greatly among multiple years due to inter-annual differences in precipitation and evaporation. (3) Although the total wetland area of the three Dongting Lake wetland reserves remained relatively stable between 2000 and 2020, the acreage of the natural wetland types still decreased by 197.0 km(2), and the change from natural wetland to human-made wetland (paddy field) contributed the most to this decrease. From the perspective of the ecological community, the human-made wetland has lower ecological function value than natural wetlands, so the balance between economic development and ecological protection in the three Dongting Lake wetland reserves requires further evaluation. The outcomes of this study could improve the understanding of the trends and driving mechanisms of wetland dynamics, which has important scientific significance and application value for the protection and restoration of Dongting Lake wetland reserves.

However, for a long time, the salinity observation in the estuary and coastal waters has not been well resolved due to the technology limitation. In this study, the SSS inversion models for the Changjiang Estuary and the adjacent sea waters were established based on machine learning methods, using SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) salinity data combined with the specific bands and bands ratios of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The performance of the three machine learning methods (Random Forest, Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) and Automatic Machine Learning (TPOT)) are compared with accuracy verification by the in-situ measured SSS. Random Forest is proven to be effective for the SSS inversion in flood season, whereas TPOP performs the best for the dry season. The machine learning-based models effectively solve the problem of insufficient time span of SSS observation from salinity satellites. At the same time, an empirical algorithm was established for the SSS inversion for the sea areas with low salinity (<30 psu) where the machine learning based model fails with great errors. The average deviation of the complex SSS inversion models is -0.86 psu, validated with Copernicus Global Ocean Reanalysis Data. The long term series SSS dataset of March and August from 2003 to 2020 was then constructed to observe the salinity distribution characteristics of the flood season and the dry season, respectively. It is indicated that the distribution pattern of CDW can be divided into three categories: northeast-oriented expansion pattern, multi direction isotropic expansion pattern, and a turn pattern of which CDW shows changing direction, namely the northeast-southeast expansion pattern. The pattern of CDW expansion is indicated to be the comprehensive effect of the interaction of different currents. In addition, it is noteworthy that CDW shows increasing expansion with decreasing SSS in the front plume, especially in the flood season. This study not only gives a feasible solution for effective SSS observation, but also provides a dataset of basic oceanographic parameters for studying the coastal biogeochemical processes, evolution of land-sea interaction, and changing trend of material and energy transport by the CDW in the west Pacific boundary.					zhang, xiaoyu/HJI-4374-2023; Bi, Lei/B-9242-2011	Bi, Lei/0000-0002-1996-880X; Wu, Mingfei/0000-0002-1181-6414; Shang, Yongheng/0000-0001-8550-6710														2072-4292				NOV	2022	14	21							5358	10.3390/rs14215358	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14215358													WOS:000881399300001

W.; de Mattos, Galia Ely; Cabral, Marcia Munick Mendes			The use of hydroelectric lakes by giant otters Pteronura brasiliensis:: Balbina lake in central Amazonia, Brazil	ORYX												Data on the occurrence and habitat use of giant otters Pteronura brasiliensis in the 4,437 km(2) of Balbina hydroelectric take in central Amazonia, Brazil, were collected from September 2001 to December 2005. Twenty-nine groups of giant otters were recorded in an area corresponding to 10% of the total reservoir. Despite the fact that it is a hydroelectric lake, the water level can vary annually by up to 3.5 m with the Amazonian seasonal flood pulse. A total of 210 dens, communal latrines and campsites of giant otters were located. An average of 37% of the dens observed were classified as in use, and the species was recorded in the lake throughout the year. Giant otters started their daily activities between 05.23 and 08.05. The average height of den openings was 28.77 +/- SD 10.00 cm, with an average width of 56.11 +/- SD 19.17 cm. Births in Balbina occur mainly during the period of high and receding water level, as reported for giant otters in other Amazonian areas. There are at least two conditions that enable the species to inhabit hydroelectric reservoirs: (1) presence of the species in the area before dam construction and (2) absence or low numbers of human communities around the reservoir. The potential use of hydroelectric lakes for the conservation of the giant otter in the Amazon is discussed.					; Cabral, Marcia/F-3732-2014	Weber Rosas, Fernando Cesar/0000-0001-6715-5689; Cabral, Marcia/0000-0002-2229-9061													0030-6053					OCT	2007	41	4					520	524		10.1017/S0030605307005121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605307005121													WOS:000252295300022

However, annual phosphorus (P) loading and its dominant causes are still unclear, especially at the watershed scale. In this study, we investigated dynamic P loadings and associated factors (e.g., land use, livestock production, and runoff depth) in ten watersheds that varied in area from 9 to 5,212 ha in a hilly area of Hunan Province, China. A flowmeter was installed at the outlet of each watershed, and total P (TP) and soluble P (SP) concentrations were monitored periodically from June 2010 to October 2012. The results showed that annual P loadings (APLs) in the ten watersheds ranged from 22.8 to 247.8 kg P/km(2) and that P loss primarily occurred from April to June of each year during the main rainfall season in the study area. In addition, the average eutrophication (>0.05 mg P/L) ratio for stream waters was 86.7 % during the study period, which was indicative of a potentially serious condition for the local water environments. Annual P loadings were linearly related to livestock density (LD; R=0.92, p<0.01), whereas the eutrophication ratio of stream water was significantly (p<0.05) correlated with LD (R=0.61), percentage cropland (R=0.71), and percentage forest cover (R=-0.68). Thus, it is concluded that the control of livestock production has the greatest potential for reducing P loadings in watersheds in this subtropical area. This will be beneficial to the amelioration and protection of local environment.					; Li, Yong/LWI-9400-2024; Meng, Cen/ISB-9371-2023; wang, yi/HTM-0992-2023	Wang, Yi/0009-0001-4960-8610; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2014	186	5					2717	2727		10.1007/s10661-013-3573-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3573-9								24343709					WOS:000333801200005

Especially at higher altitudes, these conditions influence and shape abiotic factors and the biology of stream reaches, there usually resulting in harsh environmental settings for the biota. Little is known about nutrients, food availability and food utilization in these systems. We investigated the physico-chemical conditions, food resources (DOM, CPOM, FPOM, seston, Aufwuchs) and the bottom fauna in nine reaches of different stream types (glacial, non-glacial systems) above and below the treeline in two seasons. Gut content and stable isotope (delta N-15, delta C-13) analysis were used to estimate food consumption and assimilation for dominant species. Although most of the taxa were detritivores, some species showed a preference for specific food items. Both, the principal dietary component as well as stable isotope analyses confirmed the placement of taxa into functional feeding guilds. In addition the results of stable isotope analysis suggested opportunistic feeding of several species. Autochthony appeared to play an important role even in glacial streams, where long snow cover, frequent flooding and high turbidity limit Aufwuchs development for most months of the year.

Whole body samples of three freshwater cultured fish species, grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were collected from May to October in 2015. The contents of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were measured, and their ratios were analyzed, aiming to characterize the body stoichiometry of these fish species during farming season. The main results are as follows: the concentrations of C, N, P and their ratios varied across species, while the P content in O. niloticus was significantly higher than that in C. idella and C. carpio (P < 0.05). The correlation analysis showed that body stoichiometry of the three fish species varied with size and growth significantly during the farming season. The relationship between growth rate and P content showed varied and complex relationship. Results indicated that the three fish species in aquaculture ponds did not follow strict homeostasis and the growth rate hypothesis, and bone rather than RNA was the dominant P pool. Body morphology, scale type, and food source were the main causes of interspecific differences.

We examined the influence of hydrologic seasonality on temporal variation of planktonic bacterial production (BP) in relatively undisturbed lowland rivers of the middle Orinoco basin, Venezuela. We sampled two clearwater and two blackwater rivers over 2 years for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll, phosphorus and bacterial abundance to determine their relationship to temporal variation in BP. 2. Dissolved organic carbon concentration was greater in blackwater (543-664 mum) than in clearwater rivers (184-240 mum), and was generally higher during periods of rising and high water compared with low water. Chlorophyll concentration peaked (3 mug L-1) during the first year of study when discharge was lowest, particularly in blackwater rivers. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was very low in the study rivers (<3.8 mug L-1) and concentration increased during low water. 3. Average BP was higher in clearwater (0.20-0.26 mug C L-1 h(-1)) than in blackwater rivers (0.14-0.17 mug C L-1 h(-1)), although mean bacterial abundance was similar among rivers (0.6-0.8 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)). 4. Periods of higher chlorophyll a concentration (low water) or flushing of terrestrial organic material (rising water) were accompanied by higher BP, while low BP was observed during the period of high water. 5. Interannual variation in BP was influenced by variations in discharge related to El Nino Southern Oscillation events. 6. Seasonal variation in BP in the study rivers and other tropical systems was relatively small compared with seasonal variation in temperate rivers and lakes. In addition to the low seasonal variation of temperature in the tropics, low overall human disturbance could result in less variation in the inputs of nutrients and carbon to the study rivers compared with more disturbed temperate systems.

J	Hernandez, EC; Reiss, KC; Brown, MT				Hernandez, Erica C.; Reiss, Kelly C.; Brown, Mark T.			Effect of time on consistent and repeatable macrophyte index for wetland condition	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The vegetation portion of the Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI), an index of biological integrity, provided consistent and repeatable measures of condition at eighteen wetlands sampled in two consecutive growing seasons. The sample wetlands reflected a gradient of adjacent land use from non-impacted reference areas to wetlands imbedded within silviculture, cattle pasture and residential areas. Wetlands were described as herbaceous depression (n=6), forested depression (n =5) and forested strand or floodplain wetlands (n = 7), and represented different states of succession. Even though the wetlands were unique from one another and occurred across a large geographic area in Florida, the FWCI results calculated for all the wetlands were representative of adjacent land use impacts and not sensitive to natural variation. During the duration of this study, changes in weather from drought to tropical storm conditions, as well as management activities such as fire and herbivoiy, impacted wetlands. These effects were apparent in the change of species composition between sampling periods; 23-56% of species were different when resampled. Even though composition changed, the proportion of indicators remained consistent. The resulting condition scores suggested a one-to-one relationship between sampling periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Migratory shorebirds have dynamic and shifting habitat associations under variable precipitation conditions in the Southern Great Plains	ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												As climate change alters habitat availability and quality for wildlife globally, understanding how different species respond to these changes will be critical for effective conservation. Migratory shorebirds may be especially vulnerable to climate change because of their strong dependence on a variety of weather-dependent wetlands throughout their annual cycles. However, shorebirds are also flexible in their habitat and foraging behaviors and may be able to overcome the effects of reduced wetland availability during severe weather events such as drought by increasing the intensity of their use of more permanent waterbodies (i.e., lakes and rivers). By leveraging 16 years of citizen science eBird data that cover a range of precipitation conditions, we evaluated habitat associations of 9 shorebird species that migrate through the U.S. Great Plains during spring migration. We found that, regardless of precipitation conditions, all species were more abundant in locations with greater percent area of lakes or higher densities of wetlands. However, for some species, the association between abundance or occurrence on eBird checklists and availability of different waterbody types varied depending on precipitation conditions. Specifically, abundance per checklist of Recurvirostra americana (American Avocet), Calidris bairdii (Baird's Sandpiper), Tringa melanoleuca (Greater Yellowlegs), and Charadrius vociferus (Killdeer) was greater at lakes during drought years compared to years with above-average or average precipitation. Counts of most species decreased as the percent area of the river increased, but for Tringa melanoleuca, C. vociferus, and Calidris pusilla the number of individuals counted was higher in areas with extensive river habitat during drought years. Because climate change projections indicate wetland availability will become more variable, shorebird conservation plans should consider a variety of waterbody types, including lakes and rivers, to provide migration stopover options, even during severe drought conditions, for the diverse group of shorebirds that migrate through the Great Plains. center dot Climate change will likely result in greater variability in precipitation regimes throughout the Great Plains, USA.center dot Changes in precipitation patterns will greatly influence the availability and abundance of wetlands used by migrating shorebirds that travel through the region.center dot Understanding how these species have responded to historical precipitation variability will help inform conservation measures for these species.center dot Using 16 years of eBird data, we show that all species had a positive relationship with wetland density regardless of precipitation conditions, but the abundance of several species increased at lakes or rivers during drought periods. Specifically, abundance per eBird checklist of Recurvirostra americana (American Avocet), Calidris bairdii (Baird's Sandpiper), Tringa melanoleuca (Greater Yellowlegs), and Charadrius vociferus (Killdeer) increased at lakes as drought prior to migration increased.center dot While protecting and maintaining wetland habitat is the highest priority for shorebirds, conservation plans should more explicitly account for the increased use of alternative habitats during abnormally dry or wet periods. A medida que el cambio clim & aacute;tico modifica la disponibilidad y calidad del h & aacute;bitat para la vida silvestre a nivel global, comprender c & oacute;mo responden las diferentes especies a estos cambios ser & aacute; fundamental para una conservaci & oacute;n efectiva. Las aves playeras migratorias pueden ser especialmente vulnerables al cambio clim & aacute;tico debido a su fuerte dependencia de diversos humedales que dependen de las condiciones clim & aacute;ticas a lo largo de sus ciclos anuales. Sin embargo, las aves playeras tambi & eacute;n son flexibles en su uso del h & aacute;bitat y en sus comportamientos de forrajeo, por lo que pueden superar los efectos de la reducci & oacute;n de humedales durante eventos clim & aacute;ticos severos, como las sequ & iacute;as, aumentando la intensidad de uso de cuerpos de agua m & aacute;s permanentes (i.e., lagos y r & iacute;os). Aprovechando 16 a & ntilde;os de datos de ciencia ciudadana de eBird que abarcan una variedad de condiciones de precipitaci & oacute;n, evaluamos las asociaciones de h & aacute;bitat de 9 especies de aves playeras que migran a trav & eacute;s de las Grandes Llanuras de EUA durante la migraci & oacute;n de primavera. Encontramos que, independientemente de las condiciones de precipitaci & oacute;n, todas las especies eran m & aacute;s abundantes en lugares con un mayor porcentaje de & aacute;rea de lagos o una mayor densidad de humedales. Sin embargo, en algunas especies, la relaci & oacute;n entre la abundancia o presencia en las listas de eBird y la disponibilidad de diferentes tipos de cuerpos de agua vari & oacute; seg & uacute;n las condiciones de precipitaci & oacute;n. Espec & iacute;ficamente, la abundancia seg & uacute;n las listas de chequeo de Recurvirostra americana, Calidris bairdii, Tringa melanoleuca y Charadrius vociferus fue mayor en los lagos durante los a & ntilde;os de sequ & iacute;a en comparaci & oacute;n con los a & ntilde;os de precipitaci & oacute;n promedio o superior al promedio. El conteo de la mayor & iacute;a de las especies disminuy & oacute; a medida que aumentaba el porcentaje de & aacute;rea de r & iacute;o, pero en T. melanoleuca, C. vociferus y Calidris pusilla, el n & uacute;mero de individuos contados fue mayor en & aacute;reas con h & aacute;bitat fluvial extenso durante los a & ntilde;os de sequ & iacute;a.

Based upon the existing research findings of description of encounter phenomena of typhoon and plum rain, the initial time of typhoon affecting the Taihu Lake Basin, the start time of plum rain season and the end time of plum rain season were selected as the characteristic indices of typhoon and plum rain, respectively. According to their synchronous data from 1954 to 2009, the distribution functions of the above-mentioned three random variables were identified and a formula expressing the encounter possibility of typhoon and plum rain was derived. In view of the complexity and solution of this formula, joint distribution functions of typhoon and plum rain were constructed by the use of Gumbel Copula function on the basis of the adaptability comparison among three functions (Gumbel Copula, Clayton Copula and Frank Copula) in Archimedean functions. For the characteristics of the formula with the joint distribution functions based on Gumbel Copula function, two methods, i.e., numerical integration and Monte Carlo simulation, were selected to solve the encounter probability, and the validity of the computed results was analyzed finally.

Laboratory and mesocosm-scale in situ top-down biomanipulation experiments using planktivorous fishes and filter-feeding macroinvertebrates were conducted along with identification of the limiting nutrient using nutrient enrichment bioassays (NEBs), and ecosystem health evaluation based on the modified index of biological integrity model (Reservoir Ecosystem Health Assessment; REHA). Nutrients and N/P ratio analyses during 5 years revealed that the reservoir was in a eutrophic-hypertrophic state and that the key limiting nutrients, based on the NEBs, varied among seasons. Reservoir trophic guilds indicated declines in sensitive and endemic fish species and dominance of tolerant omnivores. Model values from multimetric REHAs averaged 25.8, indicating that the ecological health was in "fair to poor" condition. Overall microcosm biomanipulation tests suggested that macroinvertebrates, specifically Palaemon paucidens and Caridina denticulata, were effective candidates for phytoplankton control, compared to fishes. In situ mesocosm experiments revealed the highest removal rates with bluegreen algae and a phytoplankton size fraction of 2-19 mu m (R (e) > 90%, Mann-Whitney U = 64.5-74.0, p < 0.01), the dominant fractions in the reservoir. Our biomanipulation technique may provide a key tool for efficient management and restoration of eutrophied reservoirs.					; Kim, Baik-Ho/D-9356-2011; Shin, Kyung-Hoon/AAD-6999-2021; Hwang, Sunjin/AAK-7149-2020; Park, Youngseuk/D-6462-2013	An, Kwang-Guk/0000-0003-2018-580X; Shin, Kyung-Hoon/0000-0002-3169-4274; Park, Young-Seuk/0000-0001-7025-8945; Park, Sangkyu/0000-0003-3049-0728; Hwang, Soon-Jin/0000-0001-7083-5036													0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	2010	205	1-4					3	24		10.1007/s11270-009-0053-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0053-5													WOS:000272851000002

Herein, the results of long term monitoring 1998-1999/2001-2008 of three reservoirs (Vir, Brno and Nove Mlyny, Chech Republic), where toxic blooms develop annually, are reported. These three reservoirs provide a unique model because they are interconnected by the Svratka River, which allows possible transfer of phytoplankton as well as toxins from one reservoir to another. The frequency of the occurrence and dominance of the major cyanobacterial taxa Alicrocystis aeruginosa did not change during the investigated period but substantial variability was observed in the composition of other phytoplankton. Although absolute concentrations of the studied toxins (microcystins) differed among the reservoirs, there were apparent parallel trends. For example, during certain years, the microcystin concentrations were systematically elevated in all three studied reservoirs. Furthermore, the concentration profiles in the three sites were also correlated (parallel trends) within individual seasons based on monthly sampling. Microcystin-LR, a variant for which the World Health Organization has recommended a guideline value, formed only about 30-50 % of the total microcystins. This is of importance, especially in the Vir reservoir that serves as a drinking water supply. The maxima in the cell-bound microcystins (intracellular; expressed per dry weight biomass) generally preceded the maxima of total microcystins (expressed per volume of water sample). Overall, the maximum concentration in the biomass (all three reservoirs, period 1993 2005) was 6.1 mg g(-1) dry weight and the median values were in the range 0.065-2.3 mg g(-1) dry weight. These are generally high concentrations in comparison with both Czech Republic and worldwide reported data. The present data revealed substantial variability of both toxic cyanobacteria and their peptide toxins that should be reflected by detailed monitoring programs.					; Blaha, Ludek/N-6343-2013; Adamovsky, Ondrej/AAW-8046-2020; Babica, Pavel/B-2587-2013	Marsalek, Blahoslav/0000-0002-5559-2723; Blaha, Ludek/0000-0002-7314-7455; Adamovsky, Ondrej/0000-0003-3084-0388; Babica, Pavel/0000-0001-6399-3554													0352-5139						2010	75	9					1303	1312		10.2298/JSC100113106B	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/JSC100113106B													WOS:000283207200014

Gary			Effects of Bythotrephes on the trophic position of native macroinvertebrates	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We measured the delta N-15 and delta C-13 stable isotopes of pelagic invertebrate predators in six central Ontario lakes, three invaded by Bythotrephes and three not invaded, to determine the effects of Bythotrephes invasion on diet overlap and trophic position of the predators. Seasonally averaged, lake-specific isotope signatures of bulk zooplankton were used as the isotopic baseline for determining nitrogen-based trophic position or carbon enrichment of the predators. Trophic positions of native Chaoborus, Leptodora, and Mysis in invaded lakes were not elevated compared with noninvaded lakes, suggesting that these predators do not feed directly on Bythotrephes. Nitrogen signatures of Mysis and Chaoborus were similar as were those of Leptodora and Bythotrephes, suggesting that invasion impacts will be greatest on Leptodora as has been observed. The trophic position of large Mysis was generally the highest and most variable of all predators, probably because it feeds on copepods that are more enriched in the heavier nitrogen isotope than bulk zooplankton and because Bythotrephes tends to decrease the ratio of cladocerans to copepods in invaded zooplankton communities.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2010	67	1					58	69		10.1139/F09-164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-164													WOS:000273522300006

Impact of pollution and seasonal changes on microbial community structure in surface water	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												We studied the differences in a microbial community structure with respect to the water pollution level and seasonal changes. The determination of phylogenetic groups of Bacteria and Archaea was done using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The total number of microorganisms was determined by direct counting of DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) stained samples using a fluorescence microscope. Our results showed that the microbial community structure was significantly dependent on the level of water pollution, both in absolute microbial counts and in relative abundance of phylogenetic groups. For surface water with anthropogenic pollution, the microbial community with significant proportion of Betaproteobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium was characteristic. Gammaproteobacteria were significant in municipal waste water. In microbial communities with low numbers of microorganisms (e. g. non-polluted water and some industrial waste water) represented the significant component groups Alphaproteobacteria and Archaea. The impact of seasonal changes on the microbial distribution was not significant.

J	Tasdemir, Y; Odabasi, M; Holsen, TM				Tasdemir, Y; Odabasi, M; Holsen, TM			Measurement of the vapor phase deposition of polychlorinated bipheyls (PCBs) using a water surface sampler	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A water surface sampler (WSS) was employed in combination with greased knife-edge surface deposition plates (KSSs) to measure the vapor phase deposition rates of PCBs to the sampler at an urban site, Chicago, IL. This sampler employed a water circulation system that continuously removed deposited PCBs. Total (gas + particle) and particulate PCB fluxes were collected with the WSS and KSSs, respectively. Gas phase PCB fluxes were then calculated by subtracting the KSS fluxes (particulate) from the WSS fluxes (gas + particle). The calculated gas phase PCB fluxes averaged 830 +/- 910 ng m(-2) d(-1). This flux value is, in general, higher than the fluxes determined using simultaneously measured air-water concentrations in natural waters and is in the absorption direction. This difference is primarily because the PCBs were continuously removed from the WSS water keeping the water PCB concentration near zero. Concurrently, ambient air samples were collected using a modified high volume air sampler. The gas phase PCB concentrations ranged between 1.10 and 4.46 ng m(-3) (average +/- SD, 2.29 +/- 1.28 ng m(-3)). The gas phase fluxes were divided by the simultaneously measured gas phase ambient concentrations to determine the overall gas phase mass transfer coefficients (MTCs) for PCBs. The average gas phase overall MTCs (K.) for each honiolog group ranged between 0.22 and 1.32 cm s(-1) (0.54 +/- 0.47cm s(-1)). The average MTC was in good agreement with those determined using similar techniques. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rukoki flowing through a belt of wetlands into Lake George. Water and sediments were investigated on the lakeshore and the lakebed. Metal associations in the sediments reflect the Kilembe sulphide mineralisation. Enrichment of metals was compared between lakebed sediments, both for wet and dry seasons. Total C in a lakebed core shows a general increment, while Cu and Co decrease with depth. The contaminants are predominant (> 65%) in the <= 63 mu m sediment size range with elevated Cu and Zn (> 28%), while Ni, Pb and Co are low (< 18%) in all the fractions. Sequential extraction of Fe for lakeshore sediment samples reveals low Fe mobility. Relatively higher mobility and biological availability is seen for Co, Cu and S. Heavy metal contents in lake waters are not an immediate risk to the aquatic environment.																			0943-0105					JAN	2007	51	6					1065	1075		10.1007/s00254-006-0398-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0398-7													WOS:000243323500019

Exploring methane cycling in an arctic lake in Kangerlussuaq Greenland using stable isotopes and 16S rRNA gene sequencing	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Lakes are currently responsible for a significant amount of total natural methane emission. Microbial oxidation of methane plays a central role in Arctic carbon cycling, potentially reducing methane emissions from lakes, though little is known about methane cycling in the water column of Arctic lakes. We previously detected surprisingly large enrichments of heavy carbon and hydrogen isotopes of methane in three small lakes in Greenland suggesting unusually efficient methanotrophic communities in these Arctic lakes. Using stable isotope and 16S rRNA gene sequencing we determined carbon and hydrogen isotopes and microbial community composition down the water column of Teardrop lake, under open-water conditions. We found that isotopic values of methane in Teardrop lake were again highly enriched C-13 and H-2 at 4 m depth with -13.2 & PTSTHOUSND; and -27.1 & PTSTHOUSND; values for carbon and hydrogen isotopes, respectively. Methane concentrations slightly increased at the depth interval with isotope enrichment, not typical of classic methanotrophy. Consistent with isotopic enrichment of the heavy isotopes we detected the highest relative abundance of putative methanotrophs, in particular Methylovulum at 4 m. The highest relative abundance of putative methanogens was detected at 3 m as well as at 5 m. At the same depth interval, temperature and oxidation reduction potential also increase, supporting increased microbial activity within the water column. Based on geochemical and microbial observations, we suggest that the methane cycling in Teardrop lake is decoupled from a traditional depth dependent model where the dominant source of methane is in the anoxic sediments. Instead, methane in the water column is likely from a combination of anoxic sediment, littoral transport and oxic methanogenesis in the mid-water column, and recycling of carbon within the water column is leading to extreme isotope enrichments. Thus, understanding linkages between depth-dependent microbial dynamics and methane biogeochemistry are necessary to constrain the sensitivity of the methane cycle to future climate change.																				2296-665X				OCT 19	2022	10								884133	10.3389/fenvs.2022.884133	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.884133													WOS:000878736500001
J	Lott, RB; Hunt, RJ				Lott, RB; Hunt, RJ			Estimating evapotranspiration in natural and constructed wetlands	WETLANDS												Difficulties in accurately calculating evapotranspiration (ET) in wetlands can lead to inaccurate water balances-information important for many compensatory mitigation projects. Simple meteorological methods or off-site ET data often are used to estimate ET, but these approaches do not include potentially important site-specific factors such as plant community, root-zone water levels, and soil properties. The objective of this study was to compare a commonly used meteorological estimate of potential evapotranspiration (PET) with direct measurements of ET (lysimeters and water-table fluctuations) and small-scale rootzone geochemistry in a natural and constructed wetland system. Unlike what has been commonly noted, the results of the study demonstrated that the commonly used Penman combination method of estimating PET underestimated the ET that was measured directly in the natural wetland over most of the growing season. This result is likely due to surface heterogeneity and related roughness effects not included in the simple PET estimate. The meteorological method more closely approximated season-long measured ET rates in the constructed wetland but may overestimate the ET rate late in the growing season. ET rates also were temporally variable in wetlands over a range of time scales because they can be influenced by the relation of the water table to the root zone and the timing of plant senescence. Small-scale geochemical sampling of the shallow root zone was able to provide an independent evaluation of ET rates, supporting the identification of higher ET rates in the natural wetlands and differences in temporal ET rates due to the timing of senescence. These discrepancies illustrate potential problems with extrapolating off-site estimates of ET or single measurements of ET from a site over space or time.																			0277-5212					DEC	2001	21	4					614	628		10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0614:EEINAC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0614:EEINAC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000172918700015
J	Steingruber, SM				Steingruber, Sandra Martina			Improved empirical models for predicting nitrogen retention in lakes and reservoirs	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Anthropogenic activities have significantly increased the movement of nitrogen (N) from land to freshwaters and to coastal waters and have led to severe environmental consequences. The flow of N is moderated by retention processes in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems have the highest areal N retention rates. The proportion of N retained in aquatic ecosystems depends on the areal hydraulic load and is described by relatively simple semi-empirical or strictly empirical models. Here I compared the predictive power of several models, that predict the annual mean proportion of total N (TN) and dissolved inorganic N (DIN) retained in lakes and reservoirs and developed an improved version of the models currently in use by inclusion of additional relevant parameters. The study shows that models derived from mass balances describing the proportion of annual mean retention of TN and DIN as a sigmoid function of the areal hydraulic load can be approximated by a linear function on the logarithm of the areal hydraulic load. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses identified the logarithm of the areal hydraulic load as the main explanatory variable for the proportion of retained TN, followed by the ratio between the DIN and the TN load and the ratio between in-lake concentrations of TN and total phosphorus (TP). The logarithm of the areal hydraulic load, the ratio between the DIN and the TN load and the logarithm of the in-lake concentration of TP explained the largest proportion of retained DIN. Addition of the second and third explanatory variable decreased the normalized root mean square deviation between the observed and predicted proportion of retained TN from 37%, to 31% and to 30% and between the observed and predicted proportion of retained DIN from 39%, to 35% and to 32%.

J	Kim, MK; Kim, YH; Lee, WS				Kim, Maeng-Ki; Kim, Yeon-Hee; Lee, Woo-Seop			Seasonal prediction of Korean regional climate from preceding large-scale climate indices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												On the basis of multivariate linear regression with an adaptive choice of climate indices as predictors, a seasonal forecast with a lead time of 2 months was applied to Korea on a monthly basis, and leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to obtain forecasting skill at the 1% significance level. The monthly ACC (anomaly correlation coefficient) skill was 0.42-0.65 for temperature and 0.35-0.63 for precipitation. COD (coefficient of determination) was 18-42% for temperature and 14-39% for precipitation. The first coupled SLP pattern related to Korean climate is very similar to the correlation pattern between the preceding climate index and SLP at the target month, indicating that preceding climate indices can be dynamically linked to Korean climate. For example, the PNA index at a lead time of 5 months prior to October is closely related to a circulation anomaly with weak negative correlation over the Okhotsk Sea to East Sea and strong positive correlation over a broad band from Lake Baikal to China. This SLP pattern provides conditions that can dynamically induce cold advection from northwestern Asia around Lake Baikal toward the Korean Peninsula, resulting in cooling over Korea.

Impact of the fish Garra on the ecology of reservoirs and the occurrence of Microcystis blooms in semi-arid tropical highlands: an experimental assessment using enclosures	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Many man-made reservoirs in the semi-arid highlands of Northern Ethiopia (Tigray) are characterised by the occurrence of intensive blooms of cyanobacteria and a dominance of small riverine fishes belonging to the genus Garra. 2. We carried out enclosure experiments to test for the effect of these small fish on abiotic characteristics, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton community structure in the pelagic of two reservoirs (Gereb Awso and Tsinkanet). Two experiments were carried out in each of the reservoirs, one at the end of the rainy season (highest water level) and one at the end of the dry season (lowest water level). 3. The presence of Garra in general increased the amount of suspended matter, nutrient concentrations (total nitrogen and total phosphorus), phytoplankton and Microcystis biomass (including the proportion of Microcystis in the phytoplankton community), and reduced water transparency. The positive effect of the presence of Garra on nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton productivity indicate that Garra has the potential to affect food web functioning indirectly through bottom-up effects, by enhancing nutrient concentrations through sediment resuspension and excretion of nutrients. Indeed, population densities of the cladoceran zooplankton taxa Ceriodaphnia and Diaphanosoma also showed an overall increase in enclosures with Garra. 4. However, our data also provide some evidence for a potential of Garra to exert top-down control on large bodied daphnids (Daphnia carinata, D. barbata), although such effect varied among experiments. The limited capability of Garra to control zooplankton communities mainly reflects the low efficiency of these small, riverine and benthos-oriented fish in foraging on zooplankton and suggests the existence of an unoccupied niche for zooplanktivorous fish in the majority of the reservoirs. 5. Although the main effects of Garra on the pelagic food web seemed to be mediated by bottom-up mechanisms, our results also indicate that one of the key variables, the relative abundance of Microcystis, was impacted by Daphnia-mediated trophic cascade effects.					; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015; Nyssen, Jan/B-8280-2009; Dejene, Tsehaye/KVB-8699-2024; Gebremichael, Anwar/D-2388-2016; Declerck, Steven/E-4338-2010	Ambaye, Teklit Gebregiorgis/0000-0002-6135-8597; Teferi, Mekonen/0000-0002-1868-3319; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Nyssen, Jan/0000-0002-2666-3860; Asgedom, Abraha Gebrekidan/0000-0002-6996-7426; Dejene, Tsehaye Asmelash/0000-0002-6182-6223; Declerck, Steven/0000-0001-6179-667X													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2009	54	8					1605	1615		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02209.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02209.x													WOS:000267831300002

Diet and reproductive dynamics of Trachelyopterus lucenai (Siluriformes: Auchenipteridae) in subtropical coastal lagoons in southern Brazil	ZOOLOGIA												This study analyzed the diet and reproductive dynamics of Trachelyopterus lucenai Bertoletti, Pezzi da Silva & Pereira, 1995, an allochthonous fish species in the subtropical coastal lagoons of the Tramandai River, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The fecundity of the species is described for the first time. Specimens were captured in the interconnected lagoons Itapeva, Quadros and Malvas, on a monthly basis, from November 2008 to April 2010, with gillnets of different mesh sizes. The food items identified were assessed for abundance and frequency of occurrence. The sex ratio, reproductive period for males and females, for mature females, fecundity, were estimated. These results were analyzed with respect to seasonal variation. We captured 135 individuals, including 82 females and 53 males, especially in months with high temperatures (October 2009 to March 2010). Females were more abundant than males in all months. There was no difference between the mean size of females and males, and both sexes showed allometric growth. The feeding analysis showed a generalist-opportunist food habit; 26 items were consumed, with a predominance of autochthonous items (insects and fish). Temporal variations in diet were associated with variations in water and air temperature and rainfall in the region, but these variations did not differ between males and females. The sex ratio differed significantly from 1:1, with 1.5 females per male. The reproductive period occurred from October to March, with most activity in November and December, and showing no variation between the peaks of gonadal development of males and females. The mean fecundity of mature females was 1,536 oocytes per spawning (n = 17). The feeding habits and reproductive behavior of the species in the study site are similar to those described for where the species is native. Although clearly seasonal, the reproductive period was long, in spite of the low fecundity. These features facilitate the establishment of T lucenai and make it a good competitor in the new environment.

The purpose of the study described in this article was to evaluate the association between Internet posting of restaurant inspection scores and the five most frequently cited critical violations in Salt Lake County, Utah. The study examined 2,995 inspections conducted at 796 full service and fast food restaurants for a one-year period before and after launch of a restaurant inspection Web site. Critical violations decreased significantly after the Web site launch compared to before-launch levels. The greatest improvements were found in temperature holding violations (odds ratio = 0.75, p < .001), hygiene practices violations (odds ratio = 0.68, p < .001) and equipment cleanliness violations (odds ratio = 0.58, p < .001). Restaurant type (full service, fast food), inspector experience, and season were significantly associated with the decrease in violations.					; Porucznik, Christy/GNP-2905-2022	VanDerslice, James/0000-0003-0008-6353; Porucznik, Christy/0000-0003-1973-2917; 													0022-0892					JUN	2013	75	10					8	12											23858661					WOS:000320832600002

Compared to natural systems, human perturbations such as watershed wood harvesting and long-term reservoir impoundment lead to profound alterations of biogeochemical processes involved in the aquatic cycle of carbon (C). We exploited these anthropogenic alterations to describe the C dynamics in five lakes and two reservoirs from the boreal forest through the analysis of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), oxygen (O-2), and organic carbon (DOC), as well as total nitrogen and phosphorus. Dissolved and particulate organic matter, forest soil/litter and leachates, as well as dissolved inorganic carbon were analyzed for elemental and stable isotopic compositions (atomic C:N ratios, delta C-13(org), delta C-13(inorg) and delta N-15(tot)). We found links between the export of terrestrial organic matter (OM) to these systems and the dissolved CO2 and O-2 concentrations in the water column, as well as CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere. All systems were GHG emitters, with greater emissions measured for systems with larger inputs of terrestrial OM. The differences in CO2 concentrations and fluxes appear controlled by bacterial activity in the water column and the sediment. Although we clearly observed differences in the aquatic C cycle between natural and perturbed systems, more work on a larger number of water bodies and encompassing all four seasons should be undertaken to better understand the controls, rates, and spatial as well as temporal variability of GHG emissions, and to make quantitatively meaningful comparisons of GHG emissions (and other key variables) from natural and perturbed systems.

Males should have enlarged structures that enhance the acquisition of mating opportunities, whereas females are predicted to have enlarged organs that are associated with the production of eggs. We tested these predictions in male and female lake whitefish, a species in which both sexes have similar overall body size and shape. After controlling for body size, male lake whitefish had significantly longer jaws and pectoral and pelvic fins, larger hearts, and more muscle than females. Sexual dimorphism in relative muscle mass may be one of the most fundamental morphological differences between males and females. Females had relatively heavier livers than males. Because the liver is important for the breakdown of fats and vitellogenesis, selection should favour an enlarged liver in females for the processing of energy and the production of large numbers of eggs.

Acoustic Imaging Observes Predator-Prey Interactions between Bull Trout and Migrating Sockeye Salmon Smolts	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Annual migrations by juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. smolts are predictable, presenting opportunities for predators to exploit these seasonal prey pulses. Directly observing predator-prey interactions to understand factors affecting predation may be possible via dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) acoustic imaging. Within Chilko Lake, British Columbia, prior telemetry and stomach content analyses suggested that the out-migration of Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka smolts influences the movements and aggregations of Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus that feed extensively on smolts during their out-migration. Bull Trout captured at a government-installed counting fence exhibited high consumption of smolts, but it is only assumed that feeding occurred directly at the fence. We used DIDSON to assess fine-scale predator-prey interactions between Sockeye Salmon smolts and Bull Trout over 10 d during the 2016 smolt out-migration. We found that smolt-Bull Trout interactions were correlated with smolt densities at the counting fence, consistent with the prior diet studies in the system. Predator-prey interactions were also coupled with nocturnal migratory behaviors of Sockeye Salmon smolts, presumably to minimize predation risk. These results demonstrate that DIDSON technology can record interactions between predators and migrating prey at a resolution that can identify variability in space and time and provide insight on the role of anthropogenic structures (e.g., counting fences) in mediating such interactions.

In Lake Biwa, although the copepod Eodiaptomus japonicus dominates the zooplankton community year-round, it has been known to produce resting eggs, yet little is known about its dormancy. To clarify the nature of dormancy in E. japonicus, we collected a sediment core from Lake Biwa, isolated resting eggs, and conducted hatching experiments to determine the life-cycle traits of the hatched individuals. We isolated 242 eggs (maximum age, 60 years) from the upper 17 cm depth sediments, and although no strict catastrophic event such as seasonal drying up was found, the findings implied that E. japonicus might have a "bet-hedging" strategy. Accumulated egg density above 17 cm was 2.5 x 10(4) m(-2), and mean annual egg flux was 10(3) m(-2) per year. Over the first 10 cm sediments, average egg hatching success was 17%. No egg hatchings were confirmed below 10 cm depth. Embryonic development times of the resting eggs were longer than those of subitaneous eggs, indicating that a lag phase existed until development resumed; 33% of hatched nauplii molted to adulthood, and 80% of females produced offspring. These results suggest potential recruitment from resting eggs in the bottom sediments, which partly serve as an egg bank in this copepod.

We first present validation of the Great Lakes specific algorithm followed by correlations of the CPAs with coincident environmental observations. Special attention is paid to the satellite observations of the extensive episodic event of sediment resuspension and calcium carbonate precipitation out of the water. We then compare the obtained time history of the CPA's spatial and temporal distributions throughout the lake to environmental observations such as air and water temperature, wind speed and direction, significant wave height, atmospheric precipitation, river runoff, and cloud and lake ice cover. Variability, of the onset, duration, and spatial extent of both episodic events and seasonal phenomena are documented from the SeaWiFS time series data, and high correlations with relevant environmental driving factors are established. The relationships between the CPAs retrieved from satellite data and environmental observations are then used to speculate on the future of Lake Michigan under a set of climate change scenarios.

Internal wave periods determined from an analytical model were compared with observations, and we show that resonance during 2000 occurred during three distinct times of the year-at the onset of stratification (March), during the heating phase (June), and during the cooling phase (November). In till cases, resonance was between the wind and the dominant radial, azimuthal, and vertical mode-one cyclonic (Kelvin) wave previously observed in Lake Kinneret.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2003	48	5					2055	2061		10.4319/lo.2003.48.5.2055	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.5.2055													WOS:000185433700031
J	Tessier, AJ; Leibold, MA; Tsao, J				Tessier, AJ; Leibold, MA; Tsao, J			A fundamental trade-off in resource exploitation by Daphnia and consequences to plankton communities	ECOLOGY												The genus Daphnia (Crustacea: Branchipoda) includes a diversity of species that art: generalist grazers on plankton in freshwater lakes. Despite substantial intraspecific variation in body size. explanations of functional differences among Daphnia species continue to emphasize body size. in this study, we ask whether Daphnia in a relatively narrow range of body sizes differ in ability to exploit the array of resources commonly encountered in lakes. We compared juvenile growth rates of several clones and species of Daphnia fed natural planktonic resources that differed in overall dietary richness. We observed, both among and within species, a trade-off between growth rates in rich and poor resource conditions. We compared the ability of different species and clones to exploit natural resources in a lake mesocosm experiment, testing the prediction that clones displaying the greatest growth rates in rich resource conditions would have the highest minimum resource requirements. Using 8000-L whole water column enclosures, replicate populations of D. rosea and two different morphs of D. pulicaria were established separately in monoculture in a thermally stratified lake. An additional treatment without crustacean zooplankton was also established. We quantified resources in the enclosures using multiple indirect measures (e.g., chlorophyll ) and a growth bioassay. Results supported predictions: rankings of resource levels achieved in the different treatments suggest that Daphnia trade off high maximum growth rates for low minimum resource requirements. This field experiment also documented large differences among the species and clones of Daphnia in their impact on phytoplankton resources, water clarity, and formation of calcite particles (whiting). We suggest that these large ecological effects stem from the trade-off in abilities to use rich vs, poor resources and constitute an important aspect of grazer-resource interactions. We review the literature on growth and reproductive responses of zooplankton species to resource level and find general agreement with the concept of a trade-off between abilities to exploit rich and poor resource conditions. A reanalysis of data from a comprehensive study on Daphniidae growth confirms our results and suggests that the breadth of species in this family conforms to the trade-off. Furthermore, the trade-off is only weakly, and not significantly, associated with body size. Our study presents a new framework for understanding the functional significance of daphniid diversity to plankton food webs and illustrates how an ecological trade-off provides a means of linking species diversity to ecosystem function.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	2000	81	3					826	841		10.2307/177380	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/177380													WOS:000085611400019
J	Cunha, DGF; Bottino, F; Calijuri, MD				Fernandes Cunha, Davi Gasparini; Bottino, Flavia; Calijuri, Maria do Carmo			Can free-floating and emerged macrophytes influence the density and diversity of phytoplankton in subtropical reservoirs?	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Aquatic macrophytes and phytoplankton are important for primary production and metabolism in lentic systems. We investigated the influence of the macrophytes on the phytoplankton in a subtropical reservoir on a seasonal scale (20092010). Our study was one of the first to investigate the effects of free-floating and emerged macrophytes on phytoplankton assemblages in a subtropical reservoir. The concentrations of total phosphorus (2592 mu g/L) and the inflow discharge to the reservoir (6.454.3 m3/s) varied seasonally (p < 0.05, multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA]) and were positively and negatively related with the macrophyte biomass, respectively (principal components analysis [PCA]). Light availability was significantly different within the sampling periods (p < 0.05) and influenced phytoplankton densities (0.6 X 103 to 21.0X103 ind/mL) and chlorophyll a (<0.551.3 mu g/L). Abiotic environmental factors and macrophytes influenced the phytoplankton dynamics, and it was difficult to clearly separate these effects. Although the MANOVA did not show seasonal variation of the macrophyte biomass (p > 0.405), the PCA suggested that phytoplankton densities were inversely correlated with the biomass of most of the macrophyte species. Higher phytoplankton diversity and flagellate species were associated with greater plant biomass. Our study has management implications because (1) although not presenting significant seasonal variation, the macrophyte biomass was inversely correlated with phytoplankton densities, and (2) the presence of free-floating and emerged plants induced qualitative shifts in the phytoplankton, increasing the diversity of species. The removal of the macrophytes by management actions (e.g., mechanical removal) or natural forces (e.g., wind effect) might influence the phytoplankton community and the trophic state of subtropical reservoirs.

Samples were collected monthly during ice-free season from March until November in 2006. Two sampling stations were chosen, the one located in Lake Sakadas, as a segment of Kopacki Rit floodplain (Croatia), and the other in the River Danube. Due to hydrological conditions we divided our samples into two hydrological groups which corresponded to: 1/ increased water level i.e. disturbed phase and 2/ decreased water level representing a more stable phase. Abundance of metazooplankton was not significantly different between hydrological groups in the River Danube. However, it was significantly different between hydrological groups in Lake Sakadas (one-way ANOSIM R = 0.688, P = 0.024), where during a decreased water level higher abundance of metazooplankton was recorded. Rotifers were the most abundant metazooplankton group during the whole investigated period at both stations and between both hydrological groups comprising almost 99% of total metazooplankton abundance. Rotifers were significantly positively correlated with the total number of bacteria, as well as with ammonium and total phosphorous concentrations. The metazooplankton community in Lake Sakadas was negatively influenced by flooding, but not in the River Danube. Compared to the River Danube the investigated floodplain lake showed potential as a storage zone for metazooplankton development during more stable hydrological periods. During that time abundance of rotifers was related to the heterotrophic component of microbial food web. Hence, this investigation adds to the understanding of the metazooplankton dynamics in river-floodplain systems as well as of their relations with trophic levels under variable hydrological conditions.

J	Hunt, JR; Young, GC				Hunt, J. R.; Young, G. C.			Depositional environment, stratigraphy, structure and paleobiology of the Hatchery Creek Group (Early-?Middle Devonian) near Wee Jasper, New South Wales	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												A revised depositional model of predominantly swampy rather than lacustrine conditions is proposed for the upper dark shales and mudstones (Corradigbee Formation) of the Hatchery Creek Group. The whole sequence is interpreted as a humid alluvial fan deposit, conformable on underlying limestones, with a total thickness of about 1800 m. Cyclic sedimentation probably resulted from climatic fluctuations much longer than seasonal events and may reflect Milankovitch cyclicity. The most recent Devonian time-scale calibrations indicate that much of the Hatchery Creek sequence could have been deposited during the Emsian, giving adequate time for subsequent folding during the Middle Devonian Tabberabberan episode. The Corradigbee Formation contains a unique fossil fish assemblage, not represented elsewhere in eastern Australia, but sharing features with Early Devonian faunas from Yunnan, China, and the Middle Devonian Aztec Siltstone fish fauna of Victoria Land, Antarctica. The first invertebrate fossils are recorded from the Hatchery Creek Group (freshwater gastropods, indeterminate arthropods). Abundant plant remains at some localities include lycopsids, some early leaf-like structures, and deep root systems preserved in paleosols, the earliest record of such features from Australia. The new data are inconsistent with Northern Hemisphere fossil evidence linked to a modelled dramatic drop in CO2 levels and rise in O-2 during the Devonian Period, but comply with some other evidence that the first forests may have evolved somewhat earlier in East Gondwana than elsewhere.																			0812-0099	1440-0952					2012	59	3					355	371		10.1080/08120099.2012.625447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2012.625447													WOS:000303565300003

Seasonal consumption of Hemimysis anomala by fish in Southeastern Lake Ontario, 2009-2010	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We investigated the seasonal occurrence of Hemimysis anomala in the diets of fish that prey on macroinvertebrates at two sites with established Hemimysis populations east of Oswego, NY, during 2009-2010. In 2009, we examined 320 stomachs from 10 species and found Hemimysis only in alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rockbass (Ambloplites rupestris), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Of those species, alewife consumed Hemimysis most frequently and it represented a greater proportion of their diets. During 2009, the dry weight composition of Hemimysis in alewife diets varied seasonally between <1% in June, 5% in July, 98.5% in August, and 18.8% in September. In contrast, we examined 667 stomachs from 15 species in 2010 and observed Hemimysis in only one alewife and two rockbass stomachs. For alewife from September 2009, we found no relationship between predator size and the number of Hemimysis consumed, or between the presence of Hemimysis in fish diets and the presence of other diet taxa or diet diversity. Fish diets collected as bycatch from other assessments revealed large numbers of Hemimysis in fishes that had not previously been observed consuming Hemimysis in Lake Ontario, including cisco (Coregonus artedi) and white perch (Morone americana). Our results indicate Hemimysis consumption by nearshore fish can be high, but that it is variable across seasons and years, and may be most prevalent in fish that feed up in the water column, at or near dark, and have the ability to consume swift moving prey like Mysis diluviana or small fish.

The females were collected from natural waters (lakes) during the spawning season, After catching, the selected fish were transported to the hatchery, where the fish were kept under controlled conditions and oocytes were collected from all females. It was found that sampled oocytes were different in size and developmental stages. Oocytes were classified into 3 groups: small, medium and large. The diameter intervals for each group were 0.18-0.22 mm, 0.48-0.57 mm and 0.95-1.01 mm, respectively. Analysis of the percentage of the largest oocytes showed that their numbers decreased in time from over 40% on Day 1 to slightly over 10% on Day 10. A positive correlation was found between the percentage of the largest oocytes in the cathetered egg sample and the weight of the stripped eggs during artificial reproduction. The percentage of the largest oocytes (diameter 0.95-1.01 mm) might be used as an indicator of the possibility of reproducing wild tench. No statistical differences were observed in latency time and embryo survival of females showing different quantities of the largest oocytes.					; Kucharczyk, Dariusz/AFA-8748-2022; Krejszeff, Slawomir/Z-2032-2018; Zarski, Daniel/H-9091-2019; Kucharczyk, D./AFA-8748-2022	ZARSKI, Daniel/0000-0003-3082-9250; Kucharczyk, Dariusz/0000-0002-0889-0656; Krejszeff, Slawomir/0000-0002-5656-9971; Mamcarz, Andrzej/0000-0003-1443-2544; Kujawa, Roman/0000-0003-0925-1204; Targonska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-6273-2587													1594-4077	1828-051X					2012	11	2							e30	10.4081/ijas.2012.e30	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ijas.2012.e30													WOS:000303984600005

A semi-structured interview administered to 40 randomly selected park neighbours was supplemented with key informant interviews, a review of secondary data, and direct observations of vertebrate pest problems and their management. All participant farmers had experienced some damage from vertebrate pests. Bushpigs ranked as the most destructive to crops, while leopards were most destructive to livestock. Most damage occurred during severe dry seasons. The most common methods for combating pests were guarding, fencing, and poisoning. Physical guarding was perceived as being the most effective method; however, there were reports of pest resurgence, which varied between pest species, seasons, and methods used. Bushpigs showed the greatest resistance against control measures. Control efforts were found to be tedious and time-consuming, and they created the possibility for the transfer of infectious diseases from pests to humans. We recommend conscious efforts to augment local control methods so as to enhance both biodiversity conservation and farm production.					; Tumusiime, Dan/HSE-6773-2023	Tumusiime, David Mwesigye/0000-0003-0171-5027; Orikiriza, Lawrence Justus Baguma/0000-0002-8931-7287; Mnason, Tweheyo/0000-0002-5461-1187													0967-0874	1366-5863					2012	58	1					25	31		10.1080/09670874.2011.641605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670874.2011.641605													WOS:000301952800003

Evaluation of correlations between precipitation, groundwater fluctuations, and lake level fluctuations using spectral methods (Wisconsin, USA)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Spectral methods and 2 years of daily data were used to estimate the phase lag between precipitation and groundwater-level response, and two decades of quarterly data were used to analyze the interaction between precipitation, lake levels and groundwater in the Trout Lake watershed located in Vilas County, Wisconsin, USA. The phase-lag function between precipitation and groundwater response is used to estimate recharge travel time. The recharge travel time and precipitation-groundwater-lake interactions have been traditionally studied using time-domain methods such as physically-based modeling. In this article, the innovative and efficient use of spectral methods is demonstrated to uncover the time scales that are significant in those interactions and estimate the recharge travel time, which is extracted from the underlying daily time series data. The results consistently show that precipitation leads groundwater-level response by up to 5 days in all cases. The effects of precipitation on lake and groundwater levels display strong similarities. Both the precipitation-lake level and the precipitation-groundwater level coherency functions show significant peaks at interannual and seasonal frequencies. The groundwater level-lake level coherency function shows a significant, broad peak at interannual frequencies, and no significant peak at seasonal frequencies, demonstrating the predominance of annual and lower frequencies in groundwater-lake interaction.																			1431-2174					JUN	2011	19	4					801	810		10.1007/s10040-011-0718-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-011-0718-1													WOS:000291488900005

Experimentally manipulated hatching time does not affect duckling survival in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Two main hypotheses proposed to explain the seasonal decline in reproductive performance in birds are (1) deterioration of environmental conditions and (2) lower parental quality of late breeders. Previous experimental work addressing these hypotheses generally have problematic biases pertaining to delay of hatching, costs of re-laying and incubation, as well as variation in the quality of eggs, territories, offspring and parental traits. We address these biases in an experimental test of the timing hypothesis (i.e. (1) above) in a precocial bird. Using a 2-year cross-over design and game-farm mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) eggs originating from a number of hens and a standardised delay procedure, we introduced early and late broods with a foster female onto boreal oligotrophic lakes and monitored subsequent duckling survival. Standardised invertebrate sampling was done concurrently to get a measure of lake-level abundance of aquatic prey, a likely causative agent of putative seasonal difference in duckling survival. Survival data and covariates (duckling age; days) were analysed by an information theoretic approach. There was no effect of treatment (i.e. manipulation of hatching date) on duckling survival, which was higher in 2005 than in 2004. In contrast to observational studies from more seasonal wetlands, our experiment demonstrates that duckling survival on boreal lakes was not affected by a 12-day delay in hatching date. Since we did not find any consistent trends in abundance of aquatic prey, i.e. neither clear peaks nor differences between treatment periods, we hypothesise that moderate climate change has minor effects on resource abundance and hence also on mallard duckling survival in boreal environments.					; Elmberg, Johan/H-1868-2014; Gunnarsson, Gunnar/G-8458-2014; Pöysä, Hannu/C-2601-2014; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021	Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633; 													1612-4642					JUN	2011	57	3					505	516		10.1007/s10344-010-0459-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0459-9													WOS:000290771400013

The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution, bioavailability and seasonal variations of inorganic phosphorus (IP) in soils of Yeyahu Wetland. The results showed that the concentration of Ca-bound P (Ca-P) remained the main occurrence in all IP fractions despite the season, at the same time the Al-bound P (Al-P) was always the lowest IP fraction despite the season. Al-P and Fe-bound P (Fe-P) concentration were all reached the highest value in May and the lowest in November, which was opposite to the occluded P (Oc-P) fraction. The notable higher Oc-P concentration in November observed in this study was probably due to the decomposition of plants and the subsequently releasing of oxides to soils. Ca-P didn't change much with season variations. Exchangeable P (Ex-P) and Oc-P were all positively correlated with soil moisture content and organic matter content, but Al-P was negatively correlated with these two soil properties. As a stable form, Ca-P was not associated with soil properties. Al-P, Fe-P and Ca-P might contribute to the storage of P in studied wetland with the principle component analysis results. The concentration rank order of the bio-available P in soils was generally as follows: Olsen-P > Algal available P (AAP) > Water soluble P (WSP) > Readily desorbed P (RDP). Olsen-P was positively correlated with Ex-P and Oc-P, and it was thought to be a more suitable indicator for bio-available P in soils.

This study focused on heterotrophic microorganisms in the two main basins (north and south) of Lake Tanganyika during dry and wet seasons in 2002. Bacteria (81% cocci) were abundant (2.28-5.30 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)). During the dry season, in the south basin, bacterial biomass reached a maximum of 2.27 g C m(-2) and phytoplankton biomass was 3.75 g C m(-2) (integrated over a water column of 100 m). 2. Protozoan abundance was constituted of 99% of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF). Communities of flagellates and bacteria consisted of very small but numerous cells. Flagellates were often the main planktonic compartment, with a biomass of 3.42-4.43 g C m(-2). Flagellate biomass was in the same range and often higher than the total autotrophic biomass (1.60-4.72 g C m(-2)). 3. Total autotrophic carbon was partly sustained by the endosymbiotic zoochlorellae Strombidium. These ciliates were present only in the euphotic zone and usually contributed most of the biomass of ciliates. 4. Total heterotrophic ciliate biomass ranged between 0.35 and 0.44 g C m(-2). In 2002, heterotrophic microorganisms consisting of bacteria, flagellates and ciliates represented a large fraction of plankton. These results support the hypothesis that the microbial food web contributes to the high productivity of Lake Tanganyika. 5. As the sole source of carbon in the pelagic zone of this large lake is phytoplankton production, planktonic heterotrophs ultimately depend on autochthonous organic carbon, most probably dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from algal excretion.

Long-term changes in aquatic plant species composition in North-eastern European Russia and Finnish Lapland, as evidenced by plant macrofossil analysis	AQUATIC BOTANY												Three lake sediment sequences from North-eastern European Russia and one from Finnish Lapland were studied for aquatic plant macrofossils. Ages of sediment sequences varied between 12 800 and ca. 10 500 radiocarbon years. Historical records showed distinct changes in the diversity and abundances of aquatic plant remains in each lake's history. Despite the studied lakes being located in different vegetation and climate zones, the records showed a similar long-term pattern of the early Holocene immigration of aquatics, a subsequent maximum in aquatic species richness, and a decline or disappearance after the mid Holocene. It seems that the warming temperature together with sufficient nutrient status enabled establishment of aquatic plant communities during the early Holocene. Afterwards the presence of the limnophytes was probably mainly controlled by the length of the open-water season (i.e. temperature), with changes in nutrient status and water level possibly being additional minor factors. Climate-driven change is supported by the fact that currently aquatic macrophytes are often absent from the lakes beyond tree lines, which are characterized by a short growing season.

J	Moore, E; San Win, U; Kyaw, PP				Moore, Elizabeth; San Win, U.; Kyaw, Pyiet Phyo			Water Management in the Urban Cultural Heritage of Myanmar	TRANS-TRANS-REGIONAL AND -NATIONAL STUDIES OF SOUTHEAST ASIA												This article assesses indigenous perceptions of water through a comparison of the water management strategies at three ancient sites located in different ecological zones of Myanmar. Two of our examples are in the high-rainfall regions of Lower Myanmar: Thagara in the Dawei River valley flanked by mountains on the east and west, and Kyaikkatha on delta lands at the egress of the Sittaung River. We contrast these adaptations with the micro-exploitation of the scarce water resources at Bagan (also spelled Pagan) in the arid zone of Upper Myanmar. In the southern wet regions, despite the different geographical setting of Thagara and Kyaikkatha, the focus was on drainage and control. Multiple ramparts and moats were used to conserve the scarce water in the dry months between December and April and control the heavy floods of the rainy months between May to November. At Bagan, sited directly on the broad Ayeyarwady River, water management of inland streams and seasonal lakes maximised the gentle slope of the plain while also coping with intermittent flash floods in the rainy months. The sites of Thagara, Kyaikkatha, and Bagan demanded specific adaptations but are alike in the absence of extensive transformation of the landscape. This balance of manmade and natural elements provides common ground despite their variable size and urbanised extent, ecological setting, and occupational sequence to highlight the shared significance of water management in their long-term urban success.

The "mosco" (Hemiptera: Corixidae and Notonectidae) of Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico: an unusual inland water fishery	LIMNOLOGY												Lake Cuitzeo is Mexico's second-largest lake (~ 425 km(2)). The West Basin is shallow, seasonally astatic and alkaline, and it contains saltwater; it is in this extreme environment that there are fisheries maintained by local fishermen that are based on non-conventional products. These products include the "mosco" (hemipteran water boatmen and backswimmers: Corixidae and Notonectidae), which has become the most important "non-conventional resource" owing to high catch rates and its contribution to the local economy; its uses include its sale as pet food for songbirds and ornamental fishes. No other commercial fisheries of adult Hemiptera are known worldwide. This study records, for the first time, the species composition of the "mosco", which was investigated through monthly sampling for twelve months at three sites in the West Basin. Seven species of aquatic Hemiptera were found: 5 species of the family Corixidae [Graptocorixa sp. (Hungerford), Corisella mercenaria (Say), Corisella edulis (Champion), Trichocorixa parvula (Champion) and Krizousacorixa azteca (Jaczewski)], and 2 species of the family Notonectidae [Buenoa scimitra (Bare) and Notonecta irrorata (Uhler)]. The seven species are new records for Lake Cuitzeo. Corixidae were more abundant than Notonectidae, at a ratio that varied from 2.3:1 to 34.2:1. Abundance peaks of up to 339 ind. m(-2) were recorded during the cold and dry season, from October/November until January, along with the highest salinity and lowest water temperatures. Graptocorixa sp. was the most abundant and widely distributed species in the West Basin, followed by Krizousacorixa azteca. The characteristics of the West Basin, such as its temporality and elevated salinity and pH, have favored the explosive development of this group, probably because these "extreme" conditions are unfavorable for competitors and predators.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2020	21	1			SI		119	127		10.1007/s10201-019-00590-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-019-00590-2													WOS:000511697700013
J	Martins, IA; Fein, D; Pompêo, MLM; Bitencourt, MD				Martins, Iris Amati; Fein, Danielle; Martins Pompeo, Marcelo Luiz; Bitencourt, Marisa Dantas			Determination of the Trophic State Index (TSI) using remote sensing, bathymetric survey and empirical data in a tropical reservoir	LIMNETICA												The reservoirs are important freshwater reserves that suffer with domestic and industrial wastes, causing qualitative and quantitative changes in their physicochemical composition, as well as causing fauna and flora impacts. One of the consequences is eutrophication, a process characterized by increased concentration of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems, mainly phosphorus and nitrogen. In order to classify waterbodies according to their trophic degrees, chlorophyll-a and phosphorus concentration data are usually obtained in water samples, feeding an equation to obtain the Trophic State Index (TSI). The method used at the present work aim to determine the TSI based on remote sensing (RS), by using the ratio between the near-infrared (NIR) and red (RED) images to infer the chlorophyll-a concentration in wet and dry seasons. This method allows a synoptic vision of the reservoir, providing support for decision-making process at low cost, especially when a large amount of data is available and/or generated, increasing quality in consonance with technological development. However, we need to consider the influence of the bottom of shallow areas when using orbital images to evaluate the waterbodies conditions, since the emerging radiation of the euphotic zone is responsible for the results reliability. Thus, it is necessary the exclusion of shallow areas, which may compromise the spectral response of the satellite images due to the bottom effects, before the development of the TSI RS Map. We created the TSI RS Maps (observed) and then we validated it with the Empirical TSI Maps (expected), obtained in 28 geo-coded points along the riverine-transition-lacustrine gradient, both for wet and dry season. We performed the chi-square test that shows how much difference exists between the observed and the expected. Both seasons presented x(2) = 1, df = 27, with critical value (0.005) of 49.64. Therefore, we found no differences between the observed and the expected. Our results reinforce the potentiality of the RS to perform the TSI favoring the identification of eutrophic areas in inland water systems with low turbidity.					; Pompêo, Marcelo/F-8795-2019; Martins, Íris/JJF-2277-2023	Pompeo, Marcelo/0000-0002-5632-9257; 													0213-8409	1989-1806					2020	39	2					539	553		10.23818/limn.39.35	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.39.35													WOS:000607495400003

A tower was installed at a small island in the reservoir, where an Eddy Covariance system, with supplementary equipments and analysers, was deployed. The objective of this work was to determine the magnitude of CO2 fluxes and their variation throughout the year. CO2 flux displayed seasonality: in warm months there was a predominance of negative CO 2 daytime fluxes and positive CO2 nighttime fluxes, which we attributed to photosynthesis/respiration in the reservoir; in cold months there was a predominance of negative CO2 fluxes in both periods, with CO2 air concentration apparently imposing the signal of the CO2 fluxes and the strong winds intensifying them. The range of 90% of the CO2 fluxes measured in this work (-102.68 to +151.72 mu g m(-2)s(-1) at the 30-min. time scale) is comparable to those observed in natural lakes and reservoirs around the world. On the average, the reservoir acted as a source of CO2, with an overall mean flux of +12.78 mu g m(-2)s(-1)					Armani, Fernando/AAZ-8409-2020; Damazio, Jorge/LUZ-7928-2024; Dias, Nelson/G-7300-2012	Armani, Fernando/0000-0001-9942-0555; Dias, Nelson/0000-0002-9770-8595													1414-381X	2318-0331					2020	25								e43	10.1590/2318-0331.252020200060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/2318-0331.252020200060													WOS:000569809100001
J	Sosa-Aranda, I; Zambrano, L				Sosa-Aranda, Inari; Zambrano, Luis			Relationship between turbidity and the benthic community in the preserved Montebello Lakes in Chiapas, Mexico	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												One of the consequences of increased turbidity in lakes is the modification of the structure of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. To understand this relationship, we evaluated 13 lakes in the Montebello Lakes National Park in Chiapas. The lakes have been affected by gradual eutrophication over decades, producing variable transparency values among lakes. Macroinvertebrates were sampled from each lake in the rainy and dry seasons, and species richness and abundance were calculated and related to Secchi disc transparency. Cluster analysis showed that community composition was similar in pristine and semitransparent lakes, in contrast with turbid lakes. Considering macroinvertebrate groups, hyalellids were dominant in pristine and semiturbid lakes, whereas chironomids were dominant in turbid lakes. A significant quadratic relationship between richness and Secchi disc depth values was found, which is consistent with the intermediate production hypothesis. This study shows how a gradual change in Secchi disc depth can markedly modify benthic communities.

J	Zhu, YK; Xing, XM; Yuan, ZH; Bao, L; Zhu, LJ; Chen, LF				Zhu, Yikai; Xing, Xuemin; Yuan, Zhihui; Bao, Liang; Zhu, Lingjie; Chen, Lifu			Surface Deformation Retrieving Over Soft Clay Based on an Improved Time Series InSAR Model: A Case Study of Dongting Lake Area, China	IEEE ACCESS												The infrastructures built on soft clay in the Dongting Lake area are more prone to settlement and instability due to its significant rheological properties. It is of great importance to conduct a long-term surface deformation monitoring over this area. The most commonly used Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) deformation models are based on combinations of one or several pure empirical mathematical functions without considering the physical and mechanical characteristics of the observed objects. In this work, we propose an improved deformation model based on the functional relationship between strain and time in the Maxwell rheological model. The rheological parameters of elastic modulus and viscosity are introduced into a traditional empirical seasonal model. The improved model is applied for the investigation of the spatial-temporal surface evolution over the Dongting Lake area with the Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology and TerraSAR-X satellite imagery. With the proposed model, the rheological parameters and the time series deformation are estimated, with the maximum accumulated subsidence estimated as 38 mm. Through the analysis of the generated results, we find that the lower the viscosity and elastic modulus are, the higher the deformation is. Temporally, the overall deformation follows a generally subsiding trend with a seasonal recovery of 5 mm from October 2012 to November 2012 and 12 mm from January 2013 to February 2013. To compensate for the deficiency of the unavailability of external geodetic measurements over this area, three different accuracy indexes (residual phase, temporal coherence, and high-pass deformation) are utilized to evaluate the modeling accuracy. The results of the improved model are also compared to three traditional models (seasonal model, cubic polynomial model, and linear model). The comparison shows that the improved model is highly recommended in this area because of its better accuracy.

J	Peters, DL; Prowse, TD				Peters, Daniel L.; Prowse, Terry D.			Generation of streamflow to seasonal high waters in a freshwater delta, northwestern Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Shallow lakes and wetlands in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), one of the world's largest freshwater deltas located in northwestern Canada, are dependent on occasional flooding to replenish evaporated water. The hydrology of the PAD has experienced natural and human induced changes in recent times. Since the early 1970s, there has been a desire to restore water to perched wetlands by managing inundation of the perimeter deltas. Before such plans are implemented, it is important to understand the generation of annual peak ice-induced and open-water floodwaters to this Nordic delta. The hydroclimatology, physiography, size, and relative locations of sub-basins exert a strong control on the runoff response. Ice-jam floods in the lower Athabasca and Peace Rivers are generated by large snowmelt runoff from 'trigger tributaries' located in the downstream (foothills and plains) portions of the basin. Flood flows during the open-water period are primarily generated by heavy rainfall runoff originating from the more elevated foothill/mountain regions where the precipitation process is enhanced by orography. In general, storage of alpine runoff in the headwaters of the Peace River places an increased dependence on downstream tributaries of the system to produce extreme flow events to the delta. Recommendations are made for additional hydrological modelling studies to assess the potential change to generation of extreme events from additional water retention/diversion schemes, land-use change, and a changing hydroclimate within the upstream contributing basins of the PAD.

Currently, ecotourism has become an important industry because of its rapid development. Many tourism practices have adverse environmental impacts. Due to the increasingly destructive commercialization of the natural resources on which we depend, there are several negative impacts. Aek Nauli Research Forest (ANRF), with an area of 1,900 hectares, is one of the natural tourist destinations around the Lake Toba Tourism area managed by the Aek Nauli Research Institute for Environmental and Forestry Development (BP2LHK). The location of the study is in Girsang District, Sipangan Bolon, Simalungun Regency, North Sumatera Province. The tourist objects are natural panorama, elephant conservation education tour, and siamang animal ape park. On average, the number of visitors of ANRF on regular days is 100-300 visitors/day and on holidays reaches 300-1,700 visitors/day. The increase in the number of visitors is perceived to have an impact on environmental sustainability. This study aims to determine the capacity of the ANRF ecotourism area to accommodate the number of tourists per day simultaneously. The method used is the effective carrying capacity by Cifuentes method based on several stages of analysis, namely Physical Capacity (PCC), Real Capacity (RCC), Management Capacity (MC), and Effective Capacity (ECC). The environmental carrying capacity analysis results showed that the PCC, RCC, ECC were 26,106 visitors/day, 3,007 visitors/day, 2,505 visitors/day respectively while MC was 0.83. This value can be used to advise managers to limit visitors, particularly during peak season, in order to preserve objects and the quality of visits.

S.			Spatial Synchrony of Diving Waterbirds Populations in Continental Wetlands of the Iberian Region	WETLANDS												Spatial population synchrony is a key aspect in ecology. Normally, three mechanisms have been identified to explain similar temporal variations in abundance between spatially separated populations: Moran effect, trophic interactions and dispersal. We analysed the spatial synchrony of the abundance of five diving waterfowl species (White-Headed Duck, Black-Necked Grebe, Red-Crested Pochard, Common Pochard and Common Coot) by conducting a monthly census from October 2013 to September 2019 in 34 lakes located in Central Spain. Twenty-eight independent variables related to the hydroperiod, anthropogenic impacts, landscape and structural variables were tested in relation to temporal patterns. Synchronised lakes groups were identified for all species, with differential associations with variables. The variables associated with spatial synchrony were: Distance between lakes (White-Headed Duck and Common Pochard); Natural vegetation area in lakes (Red-Crested Pochard) and Accumulated precipitation until the breeding season (Common Pochard and Common Coot). For Black-Necked Grebe, no variable was associated with the observed temporal patterns. These results provide the first evidence for the mechanisms behind the spatio-temporal synchronisation of diving waterbirds populations in the central Iberian region.					; López-Iborra, Germán/AFN-5919-2022; Gosálvez Rey, Rafael Ubaldo/H-8286-2015	Velasco Garcia, Angel/0000-0003-4226-7582; Gosalvez Rey, Rafael Ubaldo/0000-0003-1440-1377; Lopez Iborra, German/0000-0003-3045-5498; Valles-Medialdea, Olga/0000-0002-3162-8904													0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2022	42	7							92	10.1007/s13157-022-01604-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-022-01604-z													WOS:000866496400003

The results showed that (i) despite both FDT and VDT methods being able to describe HD propagation patterns well (i.e., slow intensification but quick recovery), the onset time, peak intensity time, and termination time of HD within a year were significantly different between the two methods, due to the different drought conceptual backgrounds of the methods. (ii) The HD months identified by VDT were close to evenly distributed in each month of the year, while the HD months identified by FDT were mainly concentrated in the dry season. (iii) The onset, peak intensity, and termination time of HD identified by FDT were in good agreement with the dryness/wetness attributes of the two study basins and can be recommended in the study case.

The relationship between phytoplankton communities and the bacteriological load was investigated in Buyukcekmece Dam Lake and selected 8 influent streams. In accordance with this purpose, water samples were collected seasonally from 9 sampling stations. The phytoplankton composition of Buyukcekmece Dam Lake and its streams constitutes 63 taxa belonging to Bacillariophyta, Charophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Cyanobacteria, Euglenozoa, Miozoa and Ochrophyta divisions. Minimum and maximum load of total heterotrophic aerobic bacteria, total and fecal coliforms were determined as 1 x 10(2) - 1,330 x 10(2), 1 x 10(2) - 378 x 10(2) and 9 x 10(2) - 551 x 10(2) CFU/mL, respectively. Especially Karasu and Cekmece streams' bacteriological load was found above the acceptable amounts in terms of bacteriologic pollution. The maximum nutrient concentrations were measured in parallel to the stations where the bacteriological load was detected at the highest density. The maximum bacteriological load was determined at Cekmece Stream (st.6) which is passing through the agricultural areas and has a low flow. Also, the water bloom-forming cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae Ralfs ex Bornet et Flahault was recorded as dominant. The lake basin, which shows mesotrophic characteristics according to physicochemical variables, has been defined as close to eutrophy since it has high nutrient salt and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Buyukcekmece Lake is the second largest drinking water source and the most affected reservoir by anthropogenic pollution in Istanbul. The water quality of the lake is affected negatively by the discharges from domestic, industrial wastewaters, and also inputs from agricultural areas. Continuing limnological studies on phytoplanktonic and bacteriologic organisms, which are accepted bioindicators in waters, have a vital role in monitoring and protecting the water of Buyukcekmece Dam Lake and its feeding streams.

J	McIntyre, PB; Michel, E; Olsgard, M				McIntyre, Peter B.; Michel, Ellinor; Olsgard, Michelle			Top-down and bottom-up controls on periphyton biomass and productivity in Lake Tanganyika	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the effects of nutrient availability and grazers on periphyton in the littoral zone of Lake Tanganyika. Using a combination of dissolved nutrient ratios, nutrient diffusing substrates, and benthic productivity responses to nutrient supplementation, we evaluated whether nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) limited periphyton productivity near Kigoma, Tanzania, during the dry seasons of 2001 and 2002. The relative effects of grazers and nutrients on periphyton were quantified by manipulating grazer access to nutrient diffusing substrates. We found very low ambient concentrations of inorganic N and soluble reactive P, but generally higher concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients. Nutrient diffusing substrates indicated a shift from P limitation in 2001 to co-limitation by N and P in 2002, probably as a consequence of unusual coastal upwelling in 2002. Productivity responses of natural epilithic algae to nutrient supplementation also indicated N-P co-limitation in 2002. However, fish and other large grazers had much stronger effects on periphyton than nutrients. Grazers strongly suppressed periphyton biomass, but had weaker negative effects on area-specific gross primary productivity as a result of large increases in biomass-specific gross primary productivity. We conclude that littoral nutrient availability influenced periphyton productivity, but that top-down control predominated.					; McIntyre, Peter/GNM-5277-2022	McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2006	51	3					1514	1523		10.4319/lo.2006.51.3.1514	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.3.1514													WOS:000237748300027
J	Battisti, C; Zocchi, A				Battisti, Corrado; Zocchi, Alessandro			Experiential Key Species for Nature-disconnected Generations: An Expert-based Framework for Their A-priori Selection	ANTHROZOOS												In urbanized contexts, a progressive disconnection from nature, mainly experienced by the youngest generation, is evident. In this sense, detection of species more suitable for a nature-related experience becomes of primary importance to increase pro-environmental behaviors in children. Here, we propose a simple, quick, and explorative procedure for selecting a set of Experiential Key Species (EKS). Two practical examples are provided for two contexts (a urban park and a suburban wetland) where a large amount of data on vertebrate animal species are available. Depending on their density and eco-behavioral features, each species stimulates different experiences, here considered as a product of intensity and frequency of occurrence. Therefore, for each species we calculated an Experiential Magnitude score on a three-level scale with an expert-based method. We obtained 14 EKS in the urban park site (18% of total) and 18 EKS in the suburban wetland site (9.4%). We observed that in both sites EKS mainly include: (i) heterotherm species (mainly, fishes, amphibians, and water-related reptiles) and (ii) non-native species (about 36% in the urban park and about 17% in the suburban wetland). This information suggests that (i) following a conservation zoning approach, lakes, streams, and their shores may be considered the best experiential sites for children, and (ii) in conservation measures aimed to improve experience and pro-environmental behaviors in younger generations, the role of non-native species (that are of low or null conservation interest) might be relevant. In-deed, individuals of these species (i) are easily detectable, and (ii) may be collected, handled, and farmed with a limited (or absent) impact on biodiversity. In many anthropized contexts, these are the only species that can provide nature experience for younger generations. Based on our observations, we recommend practitioners (i) to adopt the procedure of EKS selection in critical contexts, also adding further regime attributes (area utilized, seasonal duration) to calculate the experiential magnitude score, and (ii) to test the effectiveness of this selection in conservation education projects.

Hydrogeomorphic units based on their functional characteristics were used to distinguish 3 types of aquatic habitats within the marsh system: (1) Core Unit (CU), a permanent inundation of a wetland in the central position of a marsh system; (2) Transitional Unit (TU), a seasonal to intermittent inundation of a wetland, with seasonal saturation; and (3) Satellite Unit (SU), seasonal depression wetlands with ephemeral to intermittent saturation. We hypothesized that communities in each Unit would have specific taxonomic and functional features. Species richness was highest in the TU, with unique community composition in the SU, and moderately high species richness characterized by a stable community with high taxonomic distinctness in the CU. The metacommunity of the entire marsh was nearly random with a substantial equilibrium between beta-diversity features: replacement and dissimilarity. Our results suggest that the combination of directly connected or isolated waterbodies in close proximity to a large core waterbody is likely to maintain the highest level of diversity. Each Unit has unique characteristics and provides habitats for species with different ecological traits; thus, different aquatic habitats of a marsh system should be considered together as one meaningful ecological entity.

Environmental variables of water, diversity, and density of aquatic insects were estimated by standard methods. In the oxbow lake, dissolved oxygen values were found to be lower than that of the floodplain lake. The pH of water was found below the acceptable limit of BIS in post-monsoon in oxbow lake, and in most of the seasons in floodplain lake. Other variables were within the permissible limit. The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) and BMWPTHAI scores computed on the basis of tolerance level of the aquatic insects to organic pollution revealed poor water condition in all the sites and seasons in anua while in haor water condition was found moderate in some seasons of the year. Different biotic indices, correlation coefficients, canonical correspondence analysis were computed and the role of aquatic insects as pollution indicator has been discussed in the paper.

Most of the turtles inhabit a canal where they remain throughout the whole activity season (March to October) and where they overwinter as well. Carapace Length (CL) and body weight (BW) were measured for each individual of E. orbicularis. The size of the turtles of our population was more similar to those of northern European populations than to the Mediterranean populations; females were significantly larger than the Spanish and Italian populations. The population size was calculated as 108.50 and the density as 8.63 turtles/ha. From 6.52 to 12.77% of the population were juveniles.

Results revealed that phytoplankton community was dominated by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta with an average cell density of 4.567x10(4) ind/L. Ten species of zooplankton mainly composed of Cladocera, Copepoda and Rotifer were identified and the average abundance was 16.25ind/L. Diversity analysis showed that ShannonWiener indices of phytoplankton and zooplankton were at 2.94 to 4.57 and 3.54 to 4.24, Pielou uniformity indices were at 0.59 to 0.92 and 0.66 to 0.78, respectively. The water body of Jiulong Lake could be classified as oligotrophication by cell density while as clean to slight pollution by diversity index. The study has important practical significance for monitoring and evaluating aquatic bio-indicators reflecting the water quality of Jiulong Lake.

Singular Spectrum Analysis of Hydroecological Parameter Dynamics of Lake Naroch' in the Years 1978-2015	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) has been used to decompose continuous series of data on certain characteristics of Lake Naroch' ecosystem during the vegetative seasons of years 1978-2015 into a long-time trend, a periodic component, and a residue not amenable to decomposition. The contribution of each component to changes in this variable has been assessed. The trends accounted for 78-97% of parameter variability, and the periodic components accounted for 2.5-15%. The fluctuations of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass dynamics were the most diverse, and the contribution of these components was the greatest (15 and 8%, respectively). The periodic components in the changes of all parameters could be divided into four groups according to period duration (17-22, 7-15, 4-7, and less than 4 years). Multidimensional factor analysis of seven biotic parameters was performed in order to identify fluctuations in the ecosystem. Five major factors accounting for 93.6% of ecosystem changes together were identified, and each factor variable was subjected to SSA analysis. The period durations were similar for the oscillatory components identified. The first factor was interpreted as a trophic status of the water body, the second was taken to be the geographical location that defines the amount of solar radiation energy available, the third was taken to be the availability of biogenic elements (phosphorus in particular), and the fourth was interpreted as specific developmental cycles of live components of the ecosystem.

J	Kovar-Eder, J; Schweigert, G				Kovar-Eder, Johanna; Schweigert, Guenter			Revision of the plant assemblage of Steinheim am Albuch (Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, middle Miocene, reference locality of Mammal Neogene Zone MN 7)	BULLETIN OF GEOSCIENCES												The fossil plant assemblage of Steinheim am Albuch, reference locality of mammal Neogene zone MN 7, is revised. The plant-bearing calcareous marls (sulcatus-beds) were deposited in an impact crater lake underlying the mammal-bearing strata (trochiformis- and oxystoma-beds). Currently, MN7-8 are correlated chronostratigraphically to the Serravallian and to the Sarmatian (Central Paratethys stage). The plant fossils are preserved as mere impressions, very poor in contrast. The assemblage includes aquatic plants from the lake and its margin as well as mainly leaves of woody taxa from the terrestrial surroundings. Aquatic plants include Characeae, Cladiocarya trebovensis, Phyllites sp. - ?floating leaf, Equisetum, ?Lythraceae, ?Potamogeton geniculatus, ?Trapa, and reed and sedge-like foliage ("Typha" latissima, Monocotyledoneae). In the terrestrial flora oaks are most diverse (Quercus drymeja, Q. ?gigas, Q. kubinyii, Q. mediterranea, Q. pseudocastanea). Foliage of ?Quercus sp. is more numerous than that of all other oak species but its systematic position remains unclear. Celtis japeti, C. lacunosa, Podocarpium podocarpum, Populus balsamoides, Zelkova zelkovifolia, and Sapindales leaflets of compound leaves (Sapindales fam., gen. et sp. 1 and 2) are well documented. Acer pseudomonspessulanum vel A. integrilobum, vel Acer angustilobum, ?Carpinus sp., Buxus pliocenica, Chaneya oeningensis, cf. Daphnogene polymorpha, Leguminosites cf. hesperidum, and "Parrotia" pristina are documented based on single specimens only. Not confirmed are, among others, the following taxa described by Schweigert (1993) which would be ecologically and/or climatically relevant: Isoetes braunii recognised here as indeterminable remain, Isoetes sp. as leaf rhachis and petiole of compound leaves, Smilax which is Celtis japeti, Pistacia miochinensis determined here as Sapindales fam., gen. et sp. 2, Zanthoxylum as ?Sapindales fam., gen. et sp. 1, "Dikotylenrest (Phyllocladium)" as fragment of a damaged leaf, and Eichhornia as indeterminable remain. The plant assemblage at Steinheim is peculiar in several respects: it lacks conifers as well as winged fruits except for Chaneya oeningensis and a poor fragment (?Ailanthus sp.). Lauraceae are practically absent except for a single specimen (cf. Daphnogene polymorpha). Betulaceae are documented by a single leaf (?Carpinus sp.) only, while taxa otherwise characteristic of this time interval like beech, elms and willows are completely absent. Assuming that the terrestrial plant record represents the close lake surroundings, the composition of taxa, leaf physiognomy and assumed autecology indicate subhumid sclerophyllous forest environment and seasonal changes in precipitation under warm-temperate climatic conditions. The Steinheim flora is compared to the regional floristic record and to selected European plant assemblages.

In this study, nitrogen transport and transformations in a TPR field under multiple shallow irrigation (MSI) conditions in the Taihu Lake Basin of Eastern China were observed and simulated (Hydrus-1D model) during the 2008 and 2009 seasons based on a previous study. MSI controlled well the depth of floodwater and reduced nitrogen losses substantially through percolation and surface runoff, in particular during the 2008 season with relative less rainfall. Nitrogen balance analysis showed that both denitrification and NH3 volatilisation were the two major paths of nitrogen loss during the two seasons. Most nitrogen transformations occurred in top soil (0-40cm) during early-middle seasons. The overall nitrification and denitrification differed slightly between the two seasons but largely between soil depths, averagely 92.7% and 73.0% of respective total in a 120cm soil profile occurred in 0-40cm soil, respectively. MSI method coupled with deep applied fertiliser is recommended to substantially reduce nitrogen losses through surface runoff, percolation, and NH3 volatilisation in TPR fields.

Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content of seston and zooplankton in tropical Lake Malawi: Implications for zooplankton nutrient cycling	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Great Lakes of the World (GLOW) Conference on Advancing the Ecosystem Approach - Good Governance for Adaptation and Rehabilitation	MAR 24-26, 2015	Mangochi, MALAWI					Differences in chemical composition among zooplankton and their food sources can have important consequences for nutrient cycling in lakes. To date, studies of the interaction between plankton stoichiometry and nutrient cycling have focused primarily on temperate lakes. Here we explore the implications of plankton stoichiometry for nutrient cycling in tropical Lake Malawi. Three seston size fractions (picoplankton, nanoplankton and net plankton) displayed seasonal variations in C:P, C:N and N:P ratios. On average, picoplankton displayed lower C:P, C:N, and N:P ratios than nanoplankton and net plankton. Average C:N and C:P ratios for all seston size classes were much higher than Redfield ratios (C:N:P = 106:16:1). The elemental composition of individual species of crustacean zooplankton showed little temporal variation. However, there were large inter-species differences in P and N content, which can be expected to result in differences in N:P recycling ratios. The zooplankton community of Lake Malawi is dominated by copepods (>80% of total zooplankton biomass), which have a relatively low P content and high N:P ratio, resulting in a relatively low N:P recycling ratio. This might be expected to promote N limitation of phytoplankton and dominance of N-fixing cyanobacteria, but in some seasons the effects of zooplankton nutrient cycling appears to be masked by nutrient inputs from rivers, the atmosphere and vertical mixing.

J	Pellegrini, BG; Ferragut, C				Pellegrini, Barbara Golebski; Ferragut, Carla			Associations between epiphyton species composition and macrophyte diversity in a shallow tropical reservoir	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Macrophytes play a significant role in structuring the habitat for periphyton communities in aquatic ecosystems, especially shallow lakes and reservoirs. We evaluated the seasonal taxonomic structure changes of the algae community in epiphyton on Nymphaea spp. at sites with differences in macrophyte richness in a shallow reservoir. Nymphaea, which has a wide global distribution, has large floating leaves that do not favor a high biomass accumulation due to shading. We hypothesized that, despite the negative influence of Nymphaea, the epiphytic algae taxonomic structure is associated with spatial heterogeneity changes. Variations of macrophyte community structure and abiotic variables are used to analyze the spatial heterogeneity and its effects on the epiphyton. Water and epiphyton sampling was performed in Nymphaea monospecific and plurispecific sites (2-4 macrophytes species) in all four seasons. Epiphytic algae structure was significantly influenced by seasonality, macrophyte richness and by the interaction of these factors. We find diatom density more closely associated to a lower macrophyte richness, but flagellate density to a higher richness. Descriptor species composition primarily changed with the seasonal variation in nutrient and light availability. We conclude that the epiphytic algae community structure on rooted macrophyte (Nymphaea spp.) is sensitive to changes in spatial heterogeneity, which is mainly represented by the water chemistry and macrophyte structure (richness and coverage).

Diel cycles were carried out over a period of 12 consecutive months, between October 1999 and September 2000. The different developmental stages of T. inversus exhibited diel vertical migration (DVM) and displayed a clear ontogenetic trend, with the amplitude of DVM increasing with the age of the organism, and ranging from 0.4 m to 0.8 m for nauplii, 0.4 m to 1.2 m for copepodite, and 1.1 m to 2.1 m for adults. We observed that seasonal changes in dissolved oxygen and C. brasiliensis directly influenced the vertical distribution of the copepod population in this reservoir. Furthermore, it was showed that the diurnal vertical migration is an important predator avoidance behavior since it diminished the spatial overlap between prey and its potential predator. This finding supports the hypothesis that the vertical migration is a defense mechanism against predation. Thus, T. inversus is able to remain in the anoxic layers during day light hours, and at night they move upwards avoiding hypolimnetic waters to escape from predation by Chaoborus.

Lake trout movements in US waters of Lake Huron interpreted from coded wire tag recoveries in recreational fisheries	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake trout management and restoration make use of age-structured population models that incorporate parameters to represent movement among management areas, and harvest quotas are based on proportions of stocked fish remaining in and moving out of areas of release. We investigated movements of lake trout in U.S. waters of Lake Huron based on spatial and temporal distributions of coded-wire-tag (CWT) recoveries by trip in recreational fisheries using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). For the analysis, we incorporated as model predictors the area, month, year, and source of CWT recovery, which included reports by charterboat captains, creel-clerk interviews of non-charter anglers, and "headhunter" (CWT collection specialist) samples from charter and non-charter catch. Results indicated that CWT recoveries by trip were lowest from charterboat operators, followed by recoveries from creel clerks (2x captain reports), headhunter non-charter (3x), and headhunter charter (9x). Standardized recovery levels were highest in the management area of release and one area immediately adjacent, with remaining percentages decreasing with distance from release. CWT recovery levels decreased from May to September and suggest seasonal movement among areas that have implications for stock assessment. From standardized recoveries, we estimated that 40% of the CWT lake trout were recaptured in areas where released and others moved north, south, and southeast. Our results indicate that higher proportions of lake trout move out of release areas fish than previously shown and suggest that prior studies may be biased, in part due to lack of standardization among tag recovery sources and ignoring seasonal movements.

J	Krasnostein, AL; Oldham, CE				Krasnostein, AL; Oldham, CE			Predicting wetland water storage - art. no. W10203	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A conceptual wetland model was developed to describe the interactions between a wetland, the surrounding catchment, and the local groundwater. Numerical evaluation of the wetland water balance was achieved by applying a bucket model. The model required little calibration and used physically based catchment properties and recorded climatic data sets. Model flexibility lends itself to application across a broad range of wetland types from seasonally to permanently inundated (or saturated) systems. The model was applied to Loch McNess, a permanent open water body of maximum depth 3.4 m located on the Swan Coastal Plain in Perth, Western Australia. Groundwater flow was found to dominate the wetland water balance. The local groundwater was shown to be interactive, responding to specific conditions within the wetland. The model enabled differentiation between groundwater components. Flow paths were separated into groundwater inflows and outflows, and an overflow mechanism connecting the wetland to the nearby cave system was identified. Results from this study show that the bucket model can be used to isolate dominant hydrological processes of a wetland system, focus field studies of wetland hydrology, or facilitate management of the system.					; Oldham, Carolyn/F-8458-2013	Oldham, Carolyn/0000-0003-2968-6889; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT 2	2004	40	10							W10203	10.1029/2003WR002899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003WR002899													WOS:000224411200001

In shallow lakes, highly heterogeneous water characteristics produce a wide variety of optical environments. Such ecosystems require analysis approaches that consider a potential variability. In this study, 77 stations were used to characterize the optical properties of a shallow lake (open water surface 54 km 2). The vertical attenuation of solar radiation at 305, 313, 320 and 340 nm and at photosynthetically active radiation was measured during the seasonal cycle. Dissolved organic matter (DOM), turbidity, fluorescence, pH, temperature, conductance and dissolved oxygen were simultaneously measured. The spatial variation of the extinction spectra of the dissolved fraction at each sampling station was also measured and analyzed between 270 and 400 nm. The spatial heterogeneity of the lake was examined by determining the distributions of the attenuation coefficients and biooptical parameters at high spatial resolution and describing the distributions in a series of maps. The methodology permitted a quantitative description of the interaction between solar radiation and aquatic ecosystems as well as a spatial classification of the dominating processes within the lake. This included the determination of the role played by DOM loading and changing chemical properties within the lake optical environment.

Thus, detailed studies are needed to assess the littoral CH4 emissions in a regional scale. In this study, CH4 fluxes were followed during the ice-free seasons in 1998 and 1999 by using the static chamber method in the littoral zone of two lakes in Finland. An exceptionally high water level in 1998 caused an unusually long inundation in otherwise ephemerally flooded zone. The flooding was normal in year 1999. The factors controlling CH4 emissions were examined and statistical response functions were constructed. Further, the effect of extended flooding on the littoral CH4 budged was estimated. The methane flux was primarily regulated by the water level in grass and sedge dominated eulittoral zone, but not in infralittoral reed and water lily stands. Methane emissions in the sedge dominated zone decreased significantly, when the flood was high enough to submerge the venting structures of the plants. Besides water level, sediment temperature determined CH4 emission. The cumulative CH4 emissions from the whole littoral wetlands in wet year were 1.1 times (L. Kevaton), or 0.61 and 0.79 times (L. Mekrijarvi) those in dry year. The crucial factor was the discrepancy between the exceptional and the average water level. The extension of inundated area does not necessarily increase CH4 emissions if the flood reaches infrequently inundated areas, which apparently have low CH4 production potential. This is the case especially, if the emissions in lower zones simultaneously decrease due to high water level. Our study analyses these complex responses between CH4 emissions and water level.					; Saarnio, Sanna/A-2258-2017	Alm, Jukka/0000-0002-1470-8849; Saarnio, Sanna/0000-0002-1915-0370													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2003	9	3					413	424		10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00595.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00595.x													WOS:000181397100009

Climatic and hydrological instability in semi-arid equatorial East Africa during the late Glacial to Holocene transition: A multi-proxy reconstruction of aquatic ecosystem response in northern Tanzania	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This paper reports new multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental data on the late Glacial-Holocene transition (c. 14.8-9.3 ka) in equatorial East Africa, in the form of microfossil assemblages (chironomids, diatoms and ostracods) recovered from the sediment record of Lake Emakat, Empakaai Crater, northern Tanzania. In the context of available palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological information from the region and previously published fossil pollen and carbon and nitrogen isotopic data for the same sediment sequence, we here reconstruct local lake-system response to regional climatic and hydrological instability during the period of post-glacial warming. The aquatic biological proxy indicators suggest that the water level and chemistry of Lake Emakat evolved, first from a shallow freshwater body at 14.8 ka to a deeper freshwater phase between c. 14.4 and 10.3 ka and then to a markedly shallower, alkaline-saline environment after c. 10.3 ka. The lake appears to have been deepest between 13.2 and 12.0 ka, at a time of climatic drying when moist montane forest vegetation within the lake's crater catchment was being replaced by open wood-and scrubland. Some palaeohydrological changes reconstructed for Lake Emakat are in phase with lake evolution elsewhere in the region and thus apparently track broad-scale climate changes, but some are not. Collectively these multi-proxy paleolimnological data indicate a complex adjustment of the local aquatic ecosystem to temporal variations both in total annual effective precipitation and its seasonal distribution. The lake's hydrological response was further conditioned by local factors, notably its geological and topographic setting. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Quantifying Within-Season Repeat Spawning by Rainbow Smelt with Implications for Comparing Sex Ratios and Survey Catches among Runs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Anadromous Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax provide an important nearshore prey base, but they have experienced severe population declines during the last century. Population estimates from spawning run surveys have not been calculated because within-season repeat spawning, a behavior qualitatively described for this species based on previous studies, has not been quantified. Our objective was to determine repeat spawning behavior at two spawning sites by using passive integrated transponder technology. A preliminary laboratory tag retention and mortality study was performed to determine the effect of tagging on study results, and it showed that tagging did not cause significant mortality and tags were well retained. In our field studies, continuous monitoring of tagged fish showed that Rainbow Smelt made movements to the spawning grounds against the tide and at low tide, allowing the fish to be at the spawning grounds during the darkest nighttime hours. This is in contrast to past assumptions that Rainbow Smelt only spawn during nighttime high tide. We found that repeat spawning behavior was a predominantly male behavior, consistent with past studies. The behavior of males did vary between the two sites, although at each site the behavior was consistent among study years. In contrast, the behavior of females was consistent both among study years and between the sites. This finding indicates that future assessments of spawning populations of Rainbow Smelt could be improved by using female catch numbers, similar to other species that display skewed sex ratios.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2020	149	1					27	42		10.1002/tafs.10209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10209		DEC 2019											WOS:000503926400001

Studies indicated that semi-deciduous seasonal forests located in drainage areas in Brazil have the potential to produce 7.5 - 10.3 Mg ha(-1)/year of POM. The global increase in vegetation destruction, such as forests, threatens this allochthonous resource and can have significant impacts on river and lake communities and food chains. Therefore, it is critical that exploitation and occupation protocols are updated to protect the transition areas between terrestrial and limnic ecosystems. This review highlights the existing knowledge of these ecosystem interactions and proposes responsible sustainable methods for converting the vegetation in drainage basins. This was based on Brazilian ecosystem data and the new "Brazilian Forest Code." This study also considers the importance of including flood tracks in permanently protected areas to improve Brazilian legislation and protect hydric resources.

Given the complex hydrodynamics and ecology of the African Great Lakes, there is a clear need for spatial databases to address their inter-annual and seasonal variability. In the past, phytoplankton studies in these extensive ecosystems focused mostly on point stations or lake transects repeated over several years. In the present work, satellite based reflectances were used to determine anomalies in chlorophyll related reflectance bands over a 7-year period for the whole of Lake Tanganyika. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis was used to define regions with similar temporal co-variation of phytoplankton biomass. Using AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average modelling techniques, it was possible to determine differences in phytoplankton dynamics and link these to climate and lake basin characteristics. An important shift in the phytoplankton seasonality was observed at the end of 2000, in concomitance to changes in wind and air temperatures which favoured entrainment of nutrients present in the deeper lake waters. This shift confirms the high sensitivity of the lake to climate change. The combination of extensive satellite based measurements with modelling approaches that consider both spatial and temporal dynamics is an important contribution to the understanding of long term changes in this important freshwater ecosystem.

Zooplankton assemblage of Oyun Reservoir, Offa, Nigeria	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The influence of physico-chemical properties of Oyun Reservoir, Offa, Nigeria (a shallow tropical African reservoir) on its zooplankton composition and abundance were investigated at three stations for two years between January 2002 and December 2003. Diversity is not high: only three groups of zooplankton were found: Rotifera with eight genera; and Cladocera and Copepoda with three genera each. Rotifera dominated numerically (71.02%), followed by Cladocera (16.45%) and Copepoda (12.53%). The zooplankton was more prevalent during the rainy season, and there were variations in the composition and abundance along the reservoir continuum. Factors such as temperature, nutrients, food availability, shape and hydrodynamics of the reservoir, as well as reproductive strategies of the organisms, strongly influence the generic composition and population density of zooplankton. Prevention of ecological deterioration of the water body would greatly should result in a more productive water body, rich in zooplankton and with better fisheries. Rev. Biol.

Use of a vertical-slot fishway by galaxiids in Western Australia	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The Goodga River Fishway is the first vertical-slot fishway in Western Australia and was opened in April 2003 with the aim of increasing the habitat available to two galaxiids; the trout minnow (Galaxias truttaceus), a highly restricted freshwater fish species in Western Australia, and the widespread common jollytail (Galaxias maculatus). The fishway was designed to function during low flows to coincide with the upstream spawning migration of G. truttaceus. Prior to the opening of the fishway, no fish were found above the Goodga River gauging station (weir), which is approximately 2 km upstream of the river's entrance to Moates Lake. Fish migrations were monitored in each season between April 2003 and February 2005. Galaxias truttaceus utilised the fishway in all sampling periods. Adult fish migrated up the fishway prior to spawning, while large numbers of new recruits (small juveniles) negotiated the fishway during November 2003 and 2004. More G. truttaceus and G. maculatus were captured on the fishway during daylight hours compared with the night; however, larger G. truttaceus were more commonly captured at night whereas G. maculatus on the fishway were larger during the day. The fact that fishway utilisation by G. maculatus was consistent during all samples and new recruits migrated during periods of low flow demonstrates the importance of understanding the migration patterns of the target species when designing fishways.					; Morgan, David/H-9794-2019; Beatty, Stephen/H-8702-2019	Beatty, Stephen/0000-0003-2620-2826; Morgan, David/0000-0003-1948-1484; 													0906-6691					DEC	2006	15	4					500	509		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00190.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00190.x													WOS:000242804200016

Gymnotus aff. carapo presents a relatively long reproductive cycle extending from November/2003 to March/2004. Decreases in water conductivity and increases in dissolved oxygen are correlated with increased gonadal development in males. In females, seasonal increases in temperature and photoperiod and decreases in dissolved oxygen are correlated with increased gonadal development. The mean absolute fecundity was 915.3 oocytes, and mean relative fecundity 0.20 oocytes/mg body weight. Egg size distributions indicate multiple spawning. The size of first maturation was 141 mm in females and 146 mm in males. The sex ratio was 1:1, with a male bias only in smaller size classes.

J	Lengyel, S				Lengyel, Szabolcs			Spatial differences in breeding success in the pied avocet Recurvirostra avosetta:: effects of habitat on hatching success and chick survival	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												I studied the breeding biology of pied avocets Recurvirostra avosetta in natural habitats (alkaline lakes), and in semi-natural sites (dry fishpond, reconstructed wetlands) in Hungary to relate habitat selection patterns to spatial and temporal variation in breeding success. Colonies were initiated earlier in semi-natural sites than in natural habitats, and earlier on islands than on the mainland. Hatching success was higher on islands than on the mainland, in semi-natural sites than in natural habitats, in colonies of at least 15 pairs than in smaller colonies, and for nests initiated earlier than later within a colony. Fledging success was higher in the wet years (1999-2000) than in the dry year (1998), decreased strongly by season in both habitats and increased with average daily temperature in the first week post-hatch in 1999-2000. Most pairs hatching young in semi-natural sites attempted to lead their chicks to feeding areas in natural habitats, whereas no such movement occurred in the opposite direction. Chick mortality due to predation was high during brood movements and only 23% of the pairs moving their young produced fledglings, compared to 43% for pairs remaining in semi-natural sites and 68% for pairs hatching and rearing young in natural habitats (total n=192 broods). These results suggest that semi-natural sites were more suitable for nesting, whereas natural habitats were more suitable for chick-rearing. The opposing trends in habitat-related breeding success between nesting and chick-rearing suggest sub-optimal habitat selection by Pied Avocets due to an incorrect assessment of the potential for successful reproduction of semi-natural sites, which may thus function as ecological traps.

J	Shinker, JJ; Bartlein, PJ; Shuman, B				Shinker, Jacqueline J.; Bartlein, Patrick J.; Shuman, Bryan			Synoptic and dynamic climate controls of North American mid-continental aridity	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The mid-continent of North America was likely drier than present during the mid-Holocene, based on inferences from fossil-pollen data and estimates of past lake levels. Mid-Holocene dry conditions have often been explained by increases in the dominance (frequency and/or duration) of Pacific airmasses, zonal flow patterns, or enhanced westerlies. We analyzed modern episodes between 1959 and 1997 when westerly flow was anomalously strong (an indication of zonal flow) to determine if zonal flow is associated with drier-than-normal conditions in the mid-continent. In contrast to that expectation, composite-anomaly patterns of 500mb geopotential heights show similar meridional, as opposed to zonal, patterns for both anomalously dry and anomalously wet years, suggesting that large-scale circulation patterns alone may not provide a full explanation of surface-moisture anomalies. Anomalous moisture conditions in the midcontinent at present develop due to the dynamic interplay between surface conditions and atmospheric processes. Consideration of both moisture availability (determined by atmospheric moisture flux and soil-moisture recycling) and mechanisms for enhancing or suppressing precipitation (vertical motions in the atmosphere) is therefore required to describe the establishment of anomalously dry or wet conditions in the region today, as well as during the mid-Holocene.

J	Mondal, S; Palit, D; Hazra, N				Mondal, Saikat; Palit, Debnath; Hazra, Niladri			Study on composition and spatio-temporal variation of zooplankton community in coal mine generated pit lakes, West Bengal, India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Most of the ecological studies on mine water have been done in riverine systems, although mine-fed waterways have also been thoroughly studied. Because lakes are thought to recuperate from degradation more slowly than riverine systems, the effects of mine water on lakes are also noteworthy. In India, coal mining first began in the Raniganj coalfield (RCF). There are multiple coal mine-generated pit lakes in the RCF, West Bengal, India; however, there is a fractured and inadequate knowledge of their biological state. Washing, cleaning, and farming are all done with pit lake water. Given their core food web location, zooplankton is a good bioindicator and can be used to access the ecological health of water bodies. The spatiotemporal variation and diversity of major zooplankton groups were studied in five selected pit lakes. Zooplankton, aquatic macrophytes, sediment samples and water samples were collected during three hydrological seasons (viz., pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon). A total of 180 samples were collected (36 from each site, constituting six samples in different locations per site per season) between January 2018 and December 2019 in each pit lake. The spatio-temporal variation of the zooplankton community was found in the studied pit lakes. A total of 25 Rotifera, 7 Copepoda and 9 Cladocera were identified. Copepoda dominated the zooplankton communities in most of the studied pit lakes. Rotifera was more diverse in the Bonbedi Pit Lake, while Copepoda and Cladocera were dominant in the Dalmia Pit Lake. Canonical correspondence analysis (CAA) assesses the effect of some of the water quality, sediment parameters, and aquatic macrophytes on zooplankton density and diversity. Although pit lakes are ecologically unstable, they share some attributes with natural systems and play important roles. The finding adds to our understanding of zooplankton structure and diversity in pit lakes formed by coal mining. The existence and density of zooplankton were found to be related to the quality of their environment, and the zooplankton community delivers basic information about the ecological status of the pit lake, assisting in the formulation of appropriate planning for improved water quality management and could aid in making decisions about water reclamation strategies and conservation of pit lake ecosystem.					; Palit, Debnath/AAJ-3776-2021; HAZRA, NILADRI/Y-6330-2019; MONDAL, SAIKAT/NZO-4078-2025	HAZRA, NILADRI/0000-0001-8149-9445; 													0564-3295	2661-8982				JUN	2023	64	2					352	368		10.1007/s42965-022-00274-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42965-022-00274-6		SEP 2022											WOS:000854827300001

Monitoring of lake level and chemistry, rainfall and pan evaporation close to the lake was conducted over more than two years, recording large seasonal variations in both lake area and salinity. In addition, diatom and pollen data from a 4000 years-sediment core showed that hydrological fluctuations of much larger magnitude have occurred in the past. The instrumental record was used to establish the present-day lake water balance and to calibrate a lake level and chloride content model at a daily time step. Sensitivity experiments showed that the present-day lake is very sensitive to rainfall variations, both through direct rainfall on the lake surface and through the local shallow groundwater availability. In the sediment core, diatom data document a wet episode with freshwater conditions from ca. 3300 to 2550-2000 cal. yr, followed by a desiccation trend punctuated by large variations of diatom-inferred salinity between X2250 and 1350 cal. yr, and finally the onset towards modern conditions by 700-650 cal. yr. A digital elevation model enabled to quantitatively reconstruct the morphometric parameters of an open lake. These lake area-depth-volume relationships were used in the combined water and chloride balances model to investigate conditions of the freshwater lake, and to simulate short-term oscillations of diatom-inferred salinity and the lake evolution towards its present state. We conclude that whatever the rainfall and/or evaporation changes accounting for, the regional water table evolution was an important factor controlling the long-term lake evolution, through its successive connection/disconnection to the lake.

Geomorphological, pedological, and hydrological characteristics of karst lakes at Conversano (Apulia, southern Italy) as a basis for environmental protection	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY					Symposium on Natural and Anthropogenic Harzards in Karst Areas	APR 16, 2007	Vienna, AUSTRIA	Int Union Spelecol				The land around Conversano (Apulia, southern Italy) is part of the Murge karst, interesting limestones and dolomitic limestones of Upper Cretaceous age, in a flat environment with sub-horizontal setting. Dolines and karst depressions are the most typical landforms in the area. Filling of these landforms with eluvial deposits locally created the possibility of water stagnancy at the surface. The Conversano territory presents ten karst lakes that represented, until some decades ago, the only water resource available for the local people, who built the typical bell-shaped wells to collect water volumes satisfying local needs during the dry season. Currently, these lakes have no great importance as water supplies, but represent habitats of great naturalistic value that are still able to support the ecological functionality and the wet environments with self-vegetation. Hydrological and hydrogeological studies have been carried out with the aim to fully estimate the related environmental problems. For this purpose, the hydrogeologic data of historical time series have been collected and compared to those of the last 5 years; successively, according to the Thornthwaite method, a hydrological monthly balance has been evaluated to quantify the distribution of water volumes interacting annually between the surface water bodies and the underlying carbonate groundwater. This evaluation has highlighted the need to carefully consider all the parameters concurring to a right definition of water balance for a karst environment, where pedological features, climatic conditions and anthropogenic modifications to the environment represent the elements of a very delicate system. Particularly, on the basis of recent soil map and field surveys, a re-evaluation of the available water capacity, estimated in some 40 mm, has been carried out. The studies have highlighted the need to extend the environmental protection rules to larger areas around the lakes, e.g. at the catchment scale, with definition of buffer zones; in this manner, it will be possible to constantly monitor the protected land and the local anthropogenic activities, that represent real polluting sources for both the surface water resources and the underlying carbonate groundwaters.

J	Wallace, J; Kanaroglou, P				Wallace, Julie; Kanaroglou, Pavlos			The sensitivity of OMI-derived nitrogen dioxide to boundary layer temperature inversions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												We assess the sensitivity of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), to episodes of temperature inversion in the lower boundary layer. Vertical temperature data were obtained from a 91-m meteorological tower located in the study area, which is centered on the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area, Ontario, Canada. Hamilton is an industrial city with high traffic volumes, and is therefore subjected to high levels of pollution. Pollution buildup is amplified by frequent temperature inversions which are commonly radiative, but are also induced by local physiography, proximity to Lake Ontario, and regional meteorology. The four-year period from January 2005 to December 2008 was investigated. Ground-level data for validation were obtained from in situ air quality monitors located in the study area. The results indicate that OMI is sensitive to changes in the NO2 levels during temperature inversions, and exhibits changes which roughly parallel those of in situ monitors. Overall, an 11% increase in NO2 was identified by OMI on inversion days, compared to a 44% increase measured by in situ monitors. The weekend effect was clearly exhibited under both normal and inversion scenarios with OMI. Seasonal and wind direction patterns also correlated fairly well with ground-level data. Temperature inversions have resulted in poor air quality episodes which have severely compromised the health of susceptible populations, sometime leading to premature death. The rationale for this study is to further assess the usefulness of OMI for population exposure studies in areas with sparse resources for ground-level monitoring. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of its importance to the cultural heritage of Cyprus, the aqueduct has been selected as one of the case-study monuments in the project Wide-Range Non-Intrusive devices toward Conservation of Historical Monuments in the Mediterranean Area (WIND-CHIME). Detailed drawings of the aqueduct obtained from the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus have been used for the development of a computational model. The model was fine-tuned through the measurement of the dynamic characteristics of the aqueduct using forced and ambient vibrations. It should be noted that measurement of the dynamic characteristics of the structure were performed twice in a period of three years (June of 2004 and May of 2007). Significant differences were noted and they are attributed to soil structure interaction effects due to seasonal variations of the water-level in a nearby salt-lake. The system identification results for both cases are presented here. This monument was used to test the effectiveness of shape memory alloy (SMA) pre-stressed devices, which were developed during the course of the project, in protecting it without spoiling its monumental value.

Bioenergetics and prey consumption of breeding double-crested cormorants in the Beaver Archipelago, northern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Colonial waterbirds are an important component of Great Lakes ecosystems. In order to investigate the role these birds play in an aquatic food web, bioenergetics models, using allometric equations, were applied to breeding double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) and their offspring in the Beaver Archipelago, northern Lake Michigan. These models were parameterized using detailed information collected during the 2000 and 2001 breeding seasons, as well as literature values. Each breeding season was divided into stages in the models to reflect changes in cormorant diet and population size documented in the study area. The models estimated the total prey biomass consumed as 1,445 metric tonnes (mt) of prey in 2000, and 1,585 mt of prey in 2001. Each year, the majority of the prey biomass was alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), with these fish comprising a greater percentage of prey biomass consumed in 2001. An increase in cormorant reproductive success in 2001 may be linked to this increase in alewife biomass consumed; the breeding bird population size, however, declined in 2001 as compared to 2000. The other prey items, which are not considered to be species of commercial or sport value, were also important contributors to bird diet and consumption of these species did tend to vary from year-to-year. Overall, the application of bioenergetics models allows for greater understanding of the role of cormorants as predators and as energy links in the system.																			0380-1330					MAR	2008	34	1					122	133		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[122:BAPCOB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[122:BAPCOB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000255209400010

Furthermore, we tested the effects of vegetation structure (reed density, height and thickness) and the effect of other nest site characteristics (distance from edge, water depth) on the success of artificial nests. The experiments were completed 3 times during the breeding season in 2001 at Lake Neusiedl, Austria. Each artificial nest resembled Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) nests and contained one plasticine and one Quail (Coturnix coturnix) egg and the predators were identified by marks left on the eggs. The potential predators were birds, probably the Marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus), gulls (Larus spp.) and reed warblers (Acrocephalus spp.). Nest survival data were analysed using the Mayfield method, and we performed a discriminant analysis for the data of vegetation and nest site characteristics. The nest predation was higher at the edges than in the reed interior, and was most pronounced in April, before the new reed sprouted. The reason for this finding was probably that after May the new reed contributed to greater concealment of the nests through the higher reed density and height.

Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) otoliths indicate effects of climate and lake morphology on growth patterns in Arctic lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Climate change is occurring rapidly in the Arctic, and an improved understanding of the response of aquatic biota and ecosystems will be important for this data-limited region. Here, we applied biochronology techniques and mixed-effects modelling to assess relationships among growth increments found on lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) otoliths (N = 49) captured from 13 lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska, observed and modelled climate patterns, and individual-level fish and lake characteristics. We found that annual growth varied by year, fish growth slowed significantly as individuals aged, and females grew faster than males. Lake trout had higher growth in flow-through lakes relative to lakes that were perennially or seasonally connected. Annual growth was positively correlated with observed air temperature measurements from a local weather station for the period 1998-2014, but no clear warming trend was evident for this period. Modelled August air temperatures from 1978-2014 predicted lake trout annual growth (root mean squared error = 0.045 mm) and indicated increasing temperatures and annual lake trout growth over the period 1950-2014. This study demonstrated that biochronology techniques can reconstruct recent climate patterns and provide a better understanding of trends in Arctic lake ecosystems under a changing climate.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2023	32	1					166	180		10.1111/eff.12678	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12678		SEP 2022											WOS:000852976400001

Seasonal dynamics of cyanobacteria in a eutrophic reservoir (Arcoverde) in a semi-arid region of Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Environmental conditions favor the predominance of dense populations of cyanobacteria in reservoirs in northeastern Brazil. The aim of this study was to understand cyanobacterial population dynamics in the rainy and dry seasons at two depths in the Arcoverde reservoir. Microalgae and cyanobacteria samples were collected during 24 hours with intervals of 4 hours (nycthemeral) at sub-surface and 10 m using a van Dorn bottle and a determined biomass. Physical and chemical variables were obtained and the data were analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA). No nycthemeral variations in the taxonomic composition or distribution of the populations of cyanobacteria were found between the different times of day in either the rainy or dry season. In both seasons, the greatest biomass of the phytoplankton community was made up of cyanobacteria at two depths and all times of the day. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya et Subba Raju was dominant at all times of the day on both the surface and at the bottom. In the rainy season, the differences in cyanobacterial biomass between the surface and bottom were less significant than in the dry season. The differences in cyanobacterial biomass between surface and bottom were less pronounced than those found in the dry season. We concluded that a) physical variables better explain the alterations of species in the phytoplankton community in an environment dominated by cyanobacteria throughout the year; b) seasonal climatic factors associated to periods of stratification and de-stratification are important for alterations in the community and variations in biomass and, c) the turbidity caused by rainfall favored the emergence and establishment of other cyanobacteria, especially Planktothrix agardhii (Gomont) Anagnostidis & Komarek.

Picophytoplankton during the ice-free season in five temperate-zone rivers	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Although picophytoplankton (PP) (0.22 m) are ubiquitous in lakes and oceans, their importance in rivers has rarely been studied. We examined PP assemblages during the ice-free period in five rivers of a temperate regionvarying in trophic state (9107 g/L total phosphorus) and water discharge (187 m(3)/s). In these rivers, PP abundance reached concentrations as high as those observed in lakes and oceans (10(4)10(5) cells/mL). The highest density of PP (4.9 10(5) cells/mL) was observed in the most eutrophic river when the water temperature (28C) and total phosphorus (293 g/L) were highest. For the most part, PP abundance was dominated by non-phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria; phycocyanin-rich cells accounted for 75 of PP abundance in all the rivers. In multiple regression analyses, water temperature and nitrate concentrations explained about half of the variation in PP abundance across the rivers. Discharge had no effect on PP abundance or biomass, whereas it had a significant negative effect on total algal biomass among the rivers. The PP contribution to total chlorophyll-a averaged 27 (ranging 1646) and did not decline with increasing nutrients as found in lakes and oceans. The PP biomass from microscopic enumerations reached a maximum of 9 of total phytoplankton biomass, comparable with that observed in lakes. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of including picophytoplankton when analysing phytoplankton communities in rivers.

This study aimed to measure and analyze the specific absorption and backscattering coefficients of the main water constituents in Poyang Lake, China. The specific absorption and/or backscattering coefficients of the main water constituents at 85 sampling sites (47 in 2010 and 38 in 2011) were measured and analyzed as follows: (1) the concentrations of chlorophyll a (C (CHL)), suspended particulate matter (C (SPM)) (including suspended particulate inorganic matter (C (SPIM)) and suspended particulate organic matter (C (SPOM))), and the absorption coefficients of total particulate (a (p)), phytoplankton (a (ph)), and non-pigment particulate (a (d)) were measured in the laboratory; (2) the total backscattering coefficients at six wavelengths of 420, 442, 470, 510, 590, and 700 nm, including the contribution of pure water, were measured in the field with a HydroScat-6 backscattering sensor, and the backscattering coefficients without the contribution of pure water (b (b)) were then derived by subtracting the backscattering coefficients of pure water from the total backscattering coefficients; (3) the specific absorption coefficients of total particulate (), phytoplankton (), and non-pigment particulate () were calculated by dividing a (p), a (ph), and a (d) by C (SPM), C (CHL), and C (SPIM), respectively, while the specific backscattering coefficients of total suspended particulate matter () were calculated by dividing b (b) by C (SPM); and (4) the , , and of the remaining samples (46 in 2010 and 36 in 2011) were visualized and analyzed, and their relations to C (CHL), C (SPIM) or C (SPM) were studied, respectively. The main results are summarized as follows: (1) the values at 440 nm were 0.0367-0.7203 m(2) mg(-1) with a mean of 0.1623 +/- 0.1426 m(2) mg(-1) in 2010 and 0.0319-0.7735 m(2) mg(-1) with a mean of 0.3145 +/- 0.1961 m(2) mg(-1) in 2011; there existed significant, negative, and moderate correlations between and C (CHL) at 400-700 nm in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.05); (2) The values at 440 nm were 0.0672-0.2043 m(2) g(-1) with a mean of 0.1022 +/- 0.0326 m(2) g(-1) in 2010 and 0.0559-0.1347 m(2) g(-1) with a mean of 0.0953 +/- 0.0196 m(2) g(-1) in 2011; there existed negative correlations between and C (SPIM), while the correlations showed overall decreasing and increasing trends before and after around 575 nm with increasing wavelengths, respectively; (3) The values at 440 nm were 0.0690-0.1929 m(2) g(-1) with a mean of 0.1036 +/- 0.0298 m(2) g(-1) in 2010 and 0.0571-0.1321 m(2) g(-1) with a mean of 0.1014 +/- 0.0191 m(2) g(-1) in 2011, and the negative correlations between and C (SPM) were found in both years; (4) The at the six wavelengths generally decreased with increasing wavelengths, while the values at 420 nm were lower than those at 442 nm for some samples; the correlation between and C (SPM) increased with increasing wavelength. Such results can only represent the SIOPs during the sampling time periods, and more measurements and analyses considering different seasons need to be carried out in the future to comprehensively understand the SIOPs of Poyang Lake.

JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY												We tested whether mixotrophic ciliates are more resistant to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) than heterotrophic ones because symbiotic algae can provide self-shading by cell matter absorption and eventually by direct UV screening from mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). Sensitivity of a natural assemblage to solar radiation was tested in experiments in the original lake and in a more UV transparent alpine lake after transplantation of the ciliates. In both lakes, the assemblage was exposed either to full sunlight, to photosynthetically active radiation only, or kept in the dark. In each lake, exposure was for 5 h at the surface and at the depth corresponding to the 10% attenuation depth at 320 nm. Overall, when the assemblage was exposed to surface UVR, only one out of four dominant mixotrophic ciliates, Vorticella chlorellata, was more resistant than heterotrophic species. The higher UV resistance in V. chlorellata was related to the presence of MAAs and the high percentage of ciliate volume occupied by algal symbionts. Our results indicate that effects of UVR were species-specific and depended on efficient screening of these wavelengths, but also on the depth preference of the ciliates and thus, on their previous exposure history to UVR.

Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (K-d). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue - different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results-the answer to the question was unequivocal: K-d, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which K-d is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of K-d could reduce modeling uncertainty.

J	Marti, CL; Imberger, J				Marti, Clelia Luisa; Imberger, Jorg			Dynamics of the benthic boundary layer in a strongly forced stratified lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Field data and the three-dimensional (3D) Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM) were used to investigate the impact of periodic forcing on the structure and dynamics of the benthic boundary layer (BBL) in Lake Kinneret, Israel, a large lake that experiences strong thermal stratification and wind forcing events. Microstructure data were used to derive the thickness of the BBL and to describe the mean turbulent properties within the BBL. Time series temperature data from thermistor chains were used to characterize the thermal structure of the lake and the basin-scale internal wave field in the lake that was shown to force the turbulent field in the BBL. A clear connection between the dynamics of the BBL and the large-scale features of the flow is presented. The time history of the thickness of the BBL, the mixing in the BBL and the resulting cross-shore flux were shown to vary with the phase of the basin-scale internal wave field. Detailed comparison of simulation results with field data revealed that the model captured well the lake hydrodynamics and the spatial and temporal evolution of energetics of the BBL. Together, field data and numerical modelling provided a clear characterization of the dynamics of the turbulent BBL and its central role in setting up a boundary layer mass flux up the slope from the lake bottom to the height of the metalimnion. Both the turbulent environment in the BBL and the mass flux are of great importance for the ecological processessing of material in a lake.

Here we examine fossil malacofauna from Olduvai Gorge, inclusive of new discoveries and previous reports, and survey their potential as paleoecologic indicators. Recorded for the first time from Olduvai, an assemblage of fossil bivalve shells is attributed by character comparison to modern Chambardia wahlbergi, a freshwater unionid species widespread across Africa. The fossilized shells were localized in Bed III conglomerate channel deposits, with channel geometry exhibiting scour bases and superimposed fill structures with fining upward sequences. The ecology of recent C. wahlbergi combined with sedimentological data indicate the aquatic environment in this region during Olduvai Bed III times can be reconstructed as a periodically desiccated floodplain bordering a river channel or channels with permanent running water and marked seasonal fluctuations. This paleo-environmental setting presents drastic change compared with that of the lower Bed I and Bed II deposits, when an alkaline/saline lake extended over the site and fresh water was restricted to standing groundwater-fed pools with snail species known today to be intermediate hosts for the trematode genera Schistosoma (schistosomiasis) and Fasciola (fascioliasis). This research enhances details of landscape evolution at Olduvai basin and furthers paleoenvironmental interpretations during the time of Bed III deposition.

Characterizing seasonal patterns of variation in the size spectrum is necessary so that monitoring programs can be designed to minimize the masking effects that seasonal processes can have on detecting longer-term temporal change. We used a random effects model to measure monthly, annual, and interlake variability in the slope (i.e., relative abundance of small and large organisms) and centered height (i.e., total abundance) of the crustacean zooplankton normalized abundance size spectrum from 1981 to 2011 among eight Canadian Shield lakes. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the slope was a relatively stable characteristic of the zooplankton community compared with the height, which varied significantly among lakes. We identified a seasonal signal in height and slope and used a mixed effects model to characterize the linear rate of change from May to October; there was an overall decline in height and an overall increase in slope. Seasonal variance was greater than annual variance for both the height and the slope, suggesting that long-term monitoring of lakes and interlake comparisons using zooplankton size spectra should be based on temporally standardized sampling protocols that minimize the effects of seasonal processes. We recommend sampling the zooplankton community in midsummer because this results in size spectrum estimates close to seasonal mean values.

Evaluation of a method that uses one cubic meter mesocosms to elucidate a relationship between inoculation density and establishment probability for the nonindigenous, invasive zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species by ships is a global concern, and development and implementation of effective prevention measures are an urgent priority. Two questions plague science and policy. First, what level of reduction in live organism discharges from ships yields a given desired level of reduction in species establishment probability? Second, how can this question be empirically tested in a practicable and replicable manner? We evaulated the extent to which experiments using 1 m(3) mesocosms could help elucidate a relationship between inoculation density and reproductive output (a proxy for establishment probability) of a surrogate invader, Bythotrephes longimanus (Crustacea: Cladocera). The inoculation densities were 1, 5, 10, 20, or 40 individuals m(-3). All individuals in each inoculum were added as a single event at the start of each of four, two-week-long experiments. B. longimanus were inoculated into ambient water pumped from the Duluth-Superior Harbor at the start of each experiment between June and August, 2015. The mesocosm volume and range of inoculation densities has relevancy to the International Maritime Organization's Ballast Water Management Convention D2 standard which allows a density of < 10 viable organisms m(-3) in discharged ballast water for organisms > 50 mu m minimum dimension. Reproductive output was detected among 78 of 80 mesocosms after 2 weeks. Among 13 abiotic and biotic variables, inoculation density was overwhelmingly the best predictor, and water temperature was the second best predictor, of B. longimanus reproductive output. Net reproductive value of the inoculants was >= 1 among 35 of 80 mesocosms after 2 weeks. There was evidence for density-dependent reduction in population growth rate in the higher inoculation density mesocosms. We examined various parts of our method for robustness. Translation of the results into meaningful estimates of establishment probability in the field remains a vivid challenge. We introduce the idea of using annual hatching rates of natural banks of dormant eggs in lake sediments as a method to characterize relationships between propagule pressure and establishment probability at the scale of an ecosystem for seasonally transient species such as B. longimanus.

Isotopes in teeth and a cryptic population of coastal freshwater seals	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Human activities threaten the biodiversity of aquatic mammals across the globe. Conservation of these species hinges on the ability to delineate movements and foraging behaviors of animals, but gaining such insights is hampered by difficulties in tracing individuals over their lives. We determined isotope ratios in teeth (Sr-87/Sr-86, C-13/C-12, and O-18/O-16) to examine lifelong movement and resource-use patterns of a unique freshwater population of a wide-ranging pinniped species (harbor seal [Phoca vitulina]) that resides in Iliamna Lake, Alaska (U.S.A.). This population's potentially unique migratory behavior and use of different trophic resources are unknown. The isotope ratios we measured in teeth showed that seals were born in the lake, remained lifelong residents, and relied principally on resources produced from in the lake, even when seasonally abundant and nutrient-dense spawning anadromous fish (i.e., sockeye salmon [Oncorhynchus nerka]) were available in the lake. Our results illustrate how serial isotope records in teeth, particularly Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, can be used to quantify how coastal mammal populations exploit both freshwater and marine ecosystems. Understanding lifelong patterns of habitat and resource use is essential information when designing effective conservation plans for threatened coastal mammals. We present the Iliamna Lake harbor seals as a unique case study into how isotope records within teeth can help reveal the cryptic ecology of such a population residing in an intact ecosystem. The results also provide critical baseline information for the Kvichak River system, which is facing an uncertain future due to proposed large-scale industrial development and a rapidly changing climate.					; Brennan, Sean/KIC-3670-2024; Burns, Jennifer/AAC-8243-2019	Cerling, Thure/0000-0002-3590-294X; Burns, Jennifer/0000-0001-9652-2943; 													0888-8892	1523-1739				DEC	2019	33	6					1415	1425		10.1111/cobi.13303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13303								30820978					WOS:000495818000018

The PCB concentrations in the sediment and water of the river were found to exhibit high spatial variation. The previously contained areas of high contamination may have spread to adjacent food webs as a result of fish movements. This process may cause biased predictions in single-compartment bioaccumulation models. We performed multiple simulations and contrasted model predictions against a database of 1152 fish sample records comprising 19 sport fish species. The simulations evaluated 4 spatial scales (river-wide, 2-nation, 4-zone, and 6-zone models) to reveal how the spatial heterogeneity of contamination and species-specific movements contribute to variation in fish PCB exposures. The model testing demonstrated that the 2-nation model provided the most accurate global prediction of fish contamination. However, these improvements were not equally observed across all species. The model was subsequently calibrated for poorly performing species, by allowing cross-zone exposures, demonstrating the importance of accounting for specific ecological factors, such as fish movement, to improve PCB bioaccumulation prediction, especially in highly heterogeneous water systems.

Due to its significant contribution of surface runoff and associated nutrients input to Lake Taihu, understanding of the processes of surface runoff in this catchment is, therefore, of primary importance in quantifying water and nutrient balances for Lake Taihu. The generation of surface runoff in the catchment is mainly controlled by rainfall and land cover, so the variety of surface runoff in Xitiaoxi catchment is seasonal. Moreover, the annual change of surface runoff is distinct. Because of the diversity of land use and variety of hydrological characteristics, numerical simulation of the generation of surface runoff over this catchment is not straightforward. In this paper, attempts were made in applying the Large Scale Catchment Model (LASCAM) to Xitiaoxi catchment. The Xitiaoxi catchment is divided into 47 subcatchments connected via a river network based on topology. The model was first run in an optimization mode to calibrate the parameters against the observed runoff for the period of 1968-1977, and then was run in a prediction mode to try to reproduce the runoff for the next 10 years from 1978 to 1987. The model indicates that saturation excess runoff is probably the dominant process for the catchment. The modeling results indicate that water storage in shallow soils near the stream has a high correlation with daily rainfall, while the water storage changes in deep aquifers demonstrate an annual change trend, showing a rising level for wet seasons and a declining level for dry seasons. The success in modeling surface runoff leads to confidence in modeling nutrients transport as the next step of modeling work.

Luis Borrero's conception of the occupation of "Andean dead ends" is the pivotal framework for the study of Patagonia's western valleys. In particular, the area circumscribed by the General Carrera and Cochrane lakes and the Northern Ice field stands as a remarkable example of a dead end. In this archaeological study, we focus on the human occupation of this area by assessing site distribution, chronology, and occupational redundancy as a way of providing a preliminary outlook on an understudied area. Results suggest that human occupations extended over the last 8600 years, at first discontinuously, and with greater continuity after 3000 cal. BP. Site variability, assemblage richness, and redundancy at a site scale came alongside regional continuity. These trends are remarkably similar to those detected east of the study area and hold important differences from other to the basins north of Central Western Patagonia.

J	Pivetta, T; Braitenberg, C; Pastorutti, A				Pivetta, Tommaso; Braitenberg, Carla; Pastorutti, Alberto			Sensitivity to Mass Changes of Lakes, Subsurface Hydrology and Glaciers of the Quantum Technology Gravity Gradients and Time Observations of Satellite MOCAST	REMOTE SENSING												The quantum technology absolute gravimeters, gradiometers, and clocks are at the forefront of the instrumentation to be exploited in a future gravity mission (the QSG mission concept). Apart from the quantum payload, the mission design defines the choice of the number of satellites and the satellite orbit constellation, with the goal of optimizing the observation of the earth's gravity field and reducing aliasing phenomena. Our goal is to define the realistic gravity field changes generated by glaciers and lakes and define the sensitivity of the quantum gravity mission for the detection of hydrologic and cryospheric mass changes. The analysis focuses on mass changes in the high mountains of Asia and the South American continent. The mass changes are based on terrestrial and satellite observations and are of a climatic origin. We show that compared to the existing GRACE-FO mission, a quantum gravity mission significantly improves the detection of the climatic mass gain of lakes and mass loss of glaciers, allowing for smaller mass features to be distinguished, and smaller mass losses to be detected. The greater signal is the seasonal signal with a yearly period, which would be detected at the 10 Gt level for areas > 8000 km(2). The yearly mass loss of the Patagonian glaciers can be detected at the 5 Gt/yr level, an improvement from the 10 Gt/yr detectable by GRACE-FO. Spatial resolution would also be improved, with an increase of about 50% in spatial frequency for the detection of the mass change rate of lakes and glaciers in Tibet. The improved spatial resolution enables an improved localization of the lakes and glaciers affected by climatic mass change. The results will contribute to defining the user requirements of the future QSG missions.

Using these data, seasonal patterns of phytoplankton were analyzed as a function of the dynamic environment. Abstraction of the environmental state as a point in multi-dimensional space was used to identify habitat templates of bloom-forming groups and derive an indicator of environmental stability/physical disturbance. These templates were synthesized into a simple threshold model that sufficiently simulated development and collapse of various blooms. Blooms were, however, rare events related to specific environments with strong, unidirectional forcing. Tentative quantification of disturbance and compositional stability/community change allowed discriminating disturbance-driven changes and autogenic succession with reasonable success. The two processes were found to be equally important in shaping the composition and biomass of phytoplankton.

Paleohydrology and growth of a desert cienega	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A similar to 7000-year record of sediment accumulation from the San Bernardino cienega in southeastern Arizona/northeastern Sonora records changes in effective moisture. Periods of rapid sedimentation between ca. 700 to 1100 cal yr BP and ca. 4100 to 4400 cal yr BP at San Bernardino are associated with a highstand at pluvial Lake Cochise, the presence of aquatic pollen taxa in New Mexican packrat middens and periods of incision in river channels in the San Pedro and Santa Cruz river valleys. These results suggest that cienega deposits represent records of hydrological change and, as such, are important but under-utilized repositories of paleoclimatic information. These results also inform cienega restoration efforts by highlighting the importance of subsurface and surface water flow through these environments. Effective restoration requires the development of conditions where groundwater maintains surface vegetation and seasonal floods are allowed to inundate the surface. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Crausbay, SD; Russell, JM; Schnurrenberger, DW				Crausbay, SD; Russell, JM; Schnurrenberger, DW			A ca. 800-year lithologic record of drought from sub-annually laminated lake sediment, East Java	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lithostratigraphic analyses of a sub-annually laminated core from Ranu Lamongan, a maar lake on the island of Java, document considerable changes in the lake's chemistry and water balance over the past ca. 800 calendar years. Composition of the dark (clastics) and light (diatoms and/or calcium carbonate minerals) couplets suggests that these laminations form in response to seasonal changes in rainfall and water-column overturn in the lake. Calcium carbonate is not continuous in the core, and when it occurs it varies, sometimes abruptly, in carbonate phase and elemental composition (low Mg-calcite Mg-calcite, and aragonite). A significant correlation between Mg/Ca changes and delta(18)O variations in authigenic calcium carbonate suggest the basin is highly sensitive to hydrologic variation. Lithologic data suggest calcium carbonate precipitates and thus records hydrologic conditions during the dry season - a season in which rainfall anomalies are highly correlated with the phase of ENSO. Our carbonate-based record of Mg/Ca shows variability in evaporative concentration on a quasi-seasonal frequency for the past ca. 800 years. Our record shows two multi-decadal periods of drought - ca. 1275-1325 and ca. 1450-1650 CE - the latter of which was especially strong and/or prolonged. Our record also shows a possible change in drought frequency at around 1650 CE, in which periods of calcium carbonate precipitation and Mg/Ca change shifted from multi-decadal to interannual variability. Given the strong correlations between modern-day drought in East Java and ENSO variability, our drought record may indicate a regime shift in the behavior of the ENSO system about 350 years ago. Finally, comparisons between our record and others suggest that variation in ENSO on centennial and sub-centennial scales is not strongly associated with changes in the global mean climate state.																			0921-2728					APR	2006	35	3					641	659		10.1007/s10933-005-4440-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-4440-7													WOS:000236090300012

Eighteen trematode species were recorded.

The stability of the 4 common species was probably because of their occurrence either in a wide range of definitive hosts or in a host adapted to the extreme abiotic changes that occurred from year to year in these wetlands. The prevalence and mean abundance of C. cornutus were negatively correlated with water level in the wetlands; its prevalence was also correlated with water temperature. The mean abundance of M. anceps was positively correlated with water level. The most probable explanation for the cyclic dynamics of infections of the common species is change in population sizes and densities of definitive and intermediate hosts, which mediated cyclic alterations in water levels.

Alteration of light penetration, resulting from the presence of dense macrophytes forming a thick subsurface canopy, primarily determined epiphyton biomass. Seasonal decrease of water levels also coincided with major increases in biomass. Plant morphology was the next important variable influencing epiphytic biomass, whereas the contribution of other variables (sampling depth, macrophyte species, relative abundance of macrophytes, and temperature) was low. Groups of lowest epiphyte biomass (0.1-0.6 mg Chla g(-1) DW) were defned by the combination of a low percentage of incident light (<13% surface light) and simple macrophyte stem types found below the macrophyte canopy. Highest epiphyte biomass (0.7-1.8 mg Chla g-(1) DW) corresponded to samples collected in mid-July and August, under high irradiance (> 20% surface light) and supported by ramified stems. Our results suggest that epiphyton sampling should be stratified according to the fraction of surface light intensity, macrophyte architecture, and seasonal water level variations, in decreasing order of influence.

Methods: Total lipids were extracted with 5 mL of chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v). Samples containing gonad and liver lipid were transesterified with acidified methanol. The fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane. Fatty acids were detected by gas chromatography (GC). Results: The major saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) in both gonad and liver tissue. Oleic acid (C18:1 omega-9) and palmitoleic acid (C16:1 omega-7) were the prominent monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA). The dominant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 omega-6), arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4 omega-6), docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 omega-3) and docoesahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 omega-3). The ratio of omega-3/omega-6 ranged from 1.55 to 3.44 and 1.18 to 2.71 in the gonad and liver tissue, respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this study will be useful for understanding the seasonal distribution of fatty acid composition in the liver and gonad of spiny eel.					; kaçar, semra/H-3928-2015	kacar, semra/0000-0002-9869-9045; 													0250-4685	1303-829X				DEC	2017	42	6					617	623		10.1515/tjb-2017-0045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/tjb-2017-0045													WOS:000423989500005

J	Solarski, M				Solarski, Maksymilian			The ice phenomena dynamics of small anthropogenic water bodies in the Silesian Upland, Poland	ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES												The aim of this study was to determine the dynamics of the process of a course of ice creation phenomena in two small water bodies located in the Silesian Upland. The studies and observations of ice formation on the water bodies were conducted during the period 10th November 2011 to 23rd March 2012. The following parameters were determined each day: degree of ice coverage on each water body, thickness and ice structure and thickness of snow cover on each water body. From the studies it results that a course of the ice formation of both water bodies was almost identical. The same maximum ice thickness was recorded in both cases. It was 36 cm in that season, with slight differences in average thickness. The course of particular phases of ice formation in different water regions was also very similar. The number of days with the ice phenomena and the number of days from the beginning to the end of the ice phenomena were identical in both cases, being 96 and 131 days, respectively. The slight differences over several days were recorded in the case of: number of days with shore ice (lb), number of days with partial ice cover (lcz), number of days with an incomplete ice cover (lnp), number of breaks in the ice cover (B). Additionally, with daily measurements of ice cover thickness the relationships between the course of the average daily air temperature from the meteorological station of Faculty of Earth Sciences of University of Silesia and the daily changes in the ice thickness in the water regions in question were determined by using Spearman's correlation coefficient. In both cases the relationships were strong and they were r= -0,84(p<0,001) for the Amendy water body and r= 0,87 (p<0,001) for the Zabie Doly S water body. The maximum and average ice thickness, duration of the ice phenomena and ice cover and the obtained correlation coefficients between the air temperature and the changes in the ice thickness show that the water bodies in question are characterized by a quasi-natural ice regime.

The nanophytoplankton (< 20 mu m) accounted for 60 +/- 5% of total biomass and Scenedesmus quadricauda was the predominant species (size: 16.5 +/- 5 mu m, relative biomass 27 +/- 10%). Phytoplankton biomass was markedly suppressed in high fish stocking level and the grazing effect of silver carp on the nanoplankton was significant from the sixth week to the end of the experiment. The high fish density treatment significantly increased water transparency and somewhat reduced total phosphorus. Indirect effects of silver carp on the phytoplankton community involved excretion of nitrogen that favored small species of Chlorophyta. Colonial Cyanobacteria were reduced in the high fish treatment, but enhanced in the low fish treatment. Our results suggest that the widespread practice of harvesting fish from October to December in reservoirs of South China releases phytoplankton from consumption by filter-feeding fish, and consequently prompts algal blooms. Conversely, harvesting fish just before monsoon, around the time of restocking with small fish, would make more sense since no interruption in grazing pressure would occur. This would help to control excessive phytoplankton biomass just before monsoon.

J	Steen, DA; Gibbs, JP; Timmermans, STA				Steen, DA; Gibbs, JP; Timmermans, STA			Assessing the sensitivity of wetland bird communities to hydrologic change in the eastern Great Lakes region	WETLANDS												Uncertainty about the effects of ongoing natural and anthropogenic changes to Great Lakes ecosystems, such as managed stabilized water levels, coupled with widespread public interest regarding status of wetland birds prompted us to evaluate sensitivity of regional wetland birds to hydrologic changes. We reviewed published literature to determine preferred habitat of 30 wetland birds in the region, emphasizing vegetation required for foraging and nesting during the breeding season. Species were subsequently assigned to one of three risk categories based on association with vegetation types sensitive to water-level stabilization, as well as nesting height above water. Notably, of the bird species designated as low, moderate, and high risk, 25%, 33%, and 63%, respectively, have been regionally declining based on Bird Studies Canada's Marsh Monitoring Program. This evaluation may be useful to regional biologists, planners, and managers concerned with predicting how particular species might be affected by future hydrologic changes in this and related systems.																			0277-5212					JUN	2006	26	2					605	611		10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[605:ATSOWB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[605:ATSOWB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000238701700029

The waterbodies ranged widely in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (4.1-156.2 mg L-1) and conductivity (270-74,300 mu ohms cm(-1)). Although penetration of UV radiation (UV-R; 280-400 nm) in these systems was largely a function of DOC concentration, as has been reported previously, UV-R penetrated more deeply in saline waterbodies than in freshwater systems with similar DOC concentrations. Power models representing our KdUV-B or KdUV-A versus DOC relationships were described by KdUV-B = 0.604DOC(1.287) (r(2) = 0.76, N = 23) and KdUV-A = 0.428DOC(1.136) (r(2) = 0.55, N = 24) for freshwater systems and KdUV-B = 2.207DOC(0.732) (r(2) = 0.40, N = 20) and KdUV-A = 1.436DOC(0.600)(r(2) = 0.18, N = 20) for saline systems. Our data, when combined with data from other researchers, resulted in the more general freshwater models KdUV-B = 0.705DOC(1.248) (r(2) = 0.84, N = 43) and KdUV-A = 0.470DOC(1.112) (r2 = 0.70, N = 44), UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) is not expected to penetrate deeply (typically <50 cm) in prairie lakes and wetlands because of high intrinsic DOC concentrations. However, the central plains are characteristically windy and this, coupled with the shallowness of many of these systems, suggests that biota may still be at risk from present-day and future-enhanced levels of UV-B (which may result from ozone depletion). Moreover, this risk may be exacerbated in saline systems. This could be significant, especially because saline waterbodies are often highly productive and represent important North American staging areas for shorebirds and waterfowl.

J	Reeve, AS; Evensen, R; Glaser, PH; Siegel, DI; Rosenberry, D				Reeve, AS; Evensen, R; Glaser, PH; Siegel, DI; Rosenberry, D			Flow path oscillations in transient ground-water simulations of large peatland systems	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Transient numerical simulations of the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatland near the Red Lakes in Northern Minnesota were constructed to evaluate observed reversals in vertical ground-water flow. Seasonal weather changes were introduced to a ground-water flow model by varying evapotranspiration and recharge over time. Vertical hydraulic reversals, driven by changes in recharge and evapotranspiration were produced in the simulated peat layer. These simulations indicate that the high specific storage associated with the peat is an important control on hydraulic reversals. Seasonally driven vertical flow is on the order of centimeters in the deep peat, suggesting that seasonal vertical advective fluxes are not significant and that ground-water flow into the deep peat likely occurs on decadal or longer time scales. Particles tracked within the ground-water flow model oscillate over time, suggesting that seasonal flow reversals will enhance vertical mixing in the peat column. The amplitude of flow path oscillations increased with increasing peat storativity, with amplitudes of about 5 cm occurring when peat specific storativity was set to about 0.05 m(-1).

J	Asaeda, T; Trung, VK; Manatunge, J				Asaeda, T; Trung, VK; Manatunge, J			Modeling the effects of macrophyte growth and decomposition on the nutrient budget in Shallow Lakes	AQUATIC BOTANY												A numerical model was developed to illustrate the annual life cycle and the decomposition process of Potamogeton pectinatus L. Growth, decay, and their interactions were considered simultaneously for five fractions: main and secondary shoots, roots, tubers, and new tubers. The model was applied to field experiments carried out in Swartvlei Lake (South Africa). The predictions of the model for biomass of each fraction, standing stock of phosphorus and phosphorus content in shoots, secondary shoots and roots well agree with the observed values. The model successfully simulated the decomposition process, the remaining dry mass, and the phosphorus and nitrogen content of the remaining biomass. A series of numerical experiments were subsequently carried out to investigate the long-term effects of macrophyte decomposition on the nutrient budget of a hypothetical lake. Results show that phosphorus released in the decomposition process of macrophytes in the lake can be reduced significantly, at least by 75%, if the above-ground macrophyte biomass is harvested at the end of the growing season. Moreover, phosphate leached to the overlying water can be reduced to less than half within 10 years, if the above-ground biomass (AGB) is removed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The three-year study documented 51 species and predicted a total of 60 species for the area. Our one season study documented 39 species, of which 24, or 62%, are not shared by the three-year study, raising the total count for the LTER to 75 species. These findings emphasise limitations of species richness estimation methods and help dispel the perception that Arctic tundras are homogeneous and species poor.																			0008-347X	1918-3240				APR	2013	145	2			SI		219	226		10.4039/tce.2013.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/tce.2013.5													WOS:000316611300008
