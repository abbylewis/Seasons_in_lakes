Massive uprooting of Littorella uniflora (L.) Asch during a storm event and its relation to sediment and plant characteristics	PLANT BIOLOGY												During spring storms massive uprooting of Littorella uniflora occurred in a shallow Dutch softwater lake. The aim of this study was to test whether changes in plant morphology and sediment characteristics could explain the observed phenomenon. Uprooting was expected to occur in plants having a high shoot biomass and low root to shoot ratio (R:S), growing on sediments with a high organic matter content. Normally, uprooting of the relative buoyant L.uniflora is prevented by an extensive root system, expressed as a high R:S. This was studied by sampling floating and still rooted L.uniflora plants, as well as sediment and sediment pore water, along a gradient of increasing sediment organic matter content. Increasing organic matter content was related to increasing L.uniflora shoot biomass and consequently decreasing R:S. Furthermore, the results indicated that uprooting indeed occurred in plants growing on very organic sediments and was related to a low R:S. The increased shoot biomass on more organic sediments could be related to increased sediment pore water total inorganic carbon (TIC; mainly CO2) availability. Additionally, increased phosphorus availability could also have played a role. The disappearance of L.uniflora might lead to higher nutrient availability in the sediments. It is suggested that this could eventually promote the expansion of faster-growing macrophytes.

Use of principal component analysis to extract environmental information from lake water isotopic compositions	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake water hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopic ratios have been widely used to study the hydrologic cycle. In a given region, delta D and delta O-18 values from multiple lakes are often correlated and define a local evaporation line (LEL). The slope of and extension of each lake along this line contain information of many variables with entangled effects of important lake fluxes (e.g., evaporation). We present a new method to extract regional and local (a particular lake) environmental information based on principal component analyses (PCAs) of the delta D-delta O-18 relationships. Water of up to 30 lakes in West Greenland was sampled every summer for 5 yr, and measured for delta D and delta O-18 values. For a given year, PCA yields values of the first (Enrichment) and second (Deviance) principal components for each lake. In addition, we obtain the slope of the line along the first eigenvector, which is similar, but not identical, to the LEL. We refer to this line as the regional isotopic enrichment line (RIEL), and demonstrate that the RIEL slope changes interannually with the dominant atmospheric circulation patterns affecting regional humidity, specifically the North Atlantic Oscillation and frequency of sea breezes. The Deviance of a lake correlates strongly with its longitude and surface area, both of which influence local humidity and isotopic ratios of vapor. Conversely, Enrichment carries little extractable environmental information because it is controlled by many variables of competing effects. This method can be widely applied to both modern hydrological studies and paleoclimate reconstructions using lake sediments.					; Kopec, Ben/ABH-9846-2020	Kopec, Ben/0000-0002-6249-9156; Chipman, Jonathan/0000-0003-4629-5273													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2018	63	3					1340	1354		10.1002/lno.10776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10776													WOS:000432019600021

Despite the risk these eruptions pose, we have no reliable method to forecast whether lower magnitude eruptions are precursory to a larger event. Here we use deposits from the similar to 7.6 ka eruption of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake, Oregon) to analyze precursors to a large eruption. New compositional and textural data suggest that deposits formerly attributed to the climactic eruption include at least three precursor eruptions. In this way, the climactic Mazama eruptive sequence resembles the four-month build-up to the 1883 Krakatau eruption. Distinctive textural and compositional properties of precursor units further suggest that at least one precursory eruption tapped a separate magma lens. Together our data support the growing evidence that eruption of large magma volumes requires the pre- or syn-eruptive amalgamation of multiple melt lenses.																			2610-3540						2024	7	2					853	869		10.30909/vol.07.02.853869	http://dx.doi.org/10.30909/vol.07.02.853869													WOS:001545675000002

Thirteen and 18 species were identified from Bartin and Zonguldak, respectively. While all of the species are new reports for Bartin, 11 species are new for Zonguldak. Twenty-two species were common in both regions, with 40.9% similarities. Species abundance (49.2 individuals/site) was found to be greater in Zonguldak than in Bartin (33 individuals/site), but the number of species per sampling site was higher in Baron (0.48 spp./site) than in Zonguldak (0.42 spp./site). Increasing the numbers of sampling sites did not increase the numbers of species. Among the habitat types, the numbers of species per site was the lowest in troughs (0.35 spp./site). Canonical correspondence analyses explained 78.3% of the correlation with relatively low variance (9.8%) between the 15 most common species and 4 environmental variables in the regions, where water temperature (F = 3.216; P = 0.002) and electrical conductivity (F = 2.525; P = 0.018) displayed strong correlation with the species. However, water temperature per se did not show a significant effect on the numbers of species (P > 0.05). Cosmopolitan species showed relatively high tolerance and optimum values to different environmental variables.

The red colour has been largely absent since 1964 and a project aimed at understanding the underlying cause of the colour change was begun in 2000. It appears that there are three dinoflagellates in the lake that morphologically somewhat resemble 'G. sanguineum'. One of these agrees with the 'red form' of G. sanguineum studied in the detailed work of Baldi (1941). and is now very scarce in the plankton. The other agrees with Baldi's 'green form' and now dominates the plankton. Transmission electron microscopy has demonstrated that the third taxon is identical to what Dodge et al. (1987) identified as G. sanguineum from Lake Tovel. It did not develop a red colour under any of the growth conditions used in our experiments. The red form is very similar to Woloszynskia coronata, but differs in cyst morphology. It is shown that the red and green forms of G. sanguineum sensu Baldi are clearly distinct species. Reduction in nutrient loads entering the lake subsequent to changes in animal husbandry practices in the lake's catchment occurred around 1964. This apparently tipped the balance between the three species of dinoflagellates, resulting in the near disappearance of the red form from the plankton and concomitant disappearance of the red colour from the lake.					; Flaim, Giovanna/AAD-5013-2020; Flaim, Giovanna/C-7622-2016; Hansen, Gert/P-3328-2014	Moestrup, Ojvind/0000-0003-0965-8645; Flaim, Giovanna/0000-0002-1753-5605; Hansen, Gert/0000-0002-5751-8316													0031-8884					NOV	2004	43	6					737	743		10.2216/i0031-8884-43-6-737.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-43-6-737.1													WOS:000226220900012

Variable responses of dissolved organic carbon to precipitation events in boreal drinking water lakes	WATER RESEARCH												In boreal regions, increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been linked to extreme wet years; however, less is known about the extent to which precipitation events are altering DOC concentration and quality. We assessed the effects of rain events on a suite of six lakes in Maine, U.S.A., to better understand how events alter DOC quantity and quality. DOC concentrations and DOC quality (measured as DOC-specific absorption coefficients (Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance (SUVA(254) (also a(254)*). a(320)*, and a(380)*)) were quantified 24 h before, and at three time points (24-48 h, 5-7 days, and 3 weeks) after five different precipitation events. Our results revealed three types of responses across the lakes: (1) an initial spike in DOC concentrations of 30-133% and in the three quality metrics of 20-86% compared to pre-storm levels, followed by return to pre-storm concentrations; (2) a sustained increase in DOC concentrations (by 4-23%) and an increase in the three DOC quality metrics (by 1-43%) through the second post-storm sampling, with concentrations falling by the third post-storm sampling compared to pre-storm levels; and (3) no change during all sampling periods. Lake residence time was a key driver of changes in DOC concentration and DOC quality in response to storm events. Our research provides evidence that precipitation events contribute to short-term abrupt changes in DOC quantity and quality that are largely driven by key landscape and lake characteristics. These changes in DOC may have important implications for management of water utilities, including alteration or implementation of treatment strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Both silver carp and tilapia significantly suppressed zooplankton biomass, after which zooplankton grazing was too low to suppress algal populations. Both fish also played an important role in accelerating nutrient circulation, and their feces directly contributed to algal growth. In fact, after passing through the digestive tract of silver carp, the cyanobacteria Microcystis remained viable, and their photosynthetic activity was even stimulated; however, no viable algae were detected in the tilapia feces. Overall, algal biomass increased with increasing biomass levels of the tilapia, whereas the medium biomass level of silver carp (70 g/m(3)) was most effective in controlling cyanobacteria. Our results indicate that stocking with silver carp, rather than with tilapia, is an appropriate strategy for reducing summer cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic lakes that lack large crustaceous zooplankton, such as Lake Taihu. In addition, stocking with 70 g/m(3) of silver carp was most effective for suppressing cyanobacteria blooms and improving water quality, which suggests that this moderate biomass level can be used to achieve a beneficial balance between the positive effects of filter feeding and negative effects of feces-derived nutrients on the growth of algae. Statement of relevance: Good for algae control and aquaculture yields increase. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The construction of a substantial network of drains in the early years of settlement, to maximise transportation and agricultural production through wet winters, lead to abrupt freshening of the lakes. Interestingly, despite substantial nutrient loads to Lake Bonney SE (there are two Lakes Bonney and Frome in South Australia, which is why the lakes in the southeast of the state are differentiated with 'SE') associated with the commissioning and expansion of pulp and paper mills, a wastewater treatment plant discharge and agricultural runoff, there is only moderate evidence of nutrient enrichment in the lake, possibly because the post-impact assemblages are dominated by taxa with broad ecological preferences. Despite being preserved within a conservation park, eutrophication associated with agriculture is evident in the diatom assemblages of Lake Frome SE, which has a catchment more than twice that of Lake Bonney SE. Mullins Swamp, on the other hand, supports few indicators of eutrophic conditions. The freshening of these lakes is against the tide of salinisation from rising saline groundwaters in most wetlands across southeastern Australia.

The water resources of the Kerch Peninsula at this moment can be described as a network with temporary streams and small rivers that dry up in summer. Partially, they are often used in fisheries. But since permanent field monitoring is quite financially and resource-intensive, it becomes necessary to find a way for the automated remote monitoring of water bodies using remote sensing data. In this work, we used remote sensing data obtained using the Sentinel-2 satellite in the period from 2017 to 2022 during the days of field expeditions to map the water bodies of the Kerch Peninsula. As a training data set for surface water prediction, field expeditions data were used. The area for test data collection is located near Lake Tobechikskoye, where there are five water bodies. The Keras framework, written in Python, was used to build the architecture of a deep neural network. The architecture of the neural network consisted of one flattened and four dense layers fully connected. As a result, it achieved a model prediction accuracy of 96% when solving the problem of extracting the area of the water surface using remote sensing data. The obtained model showed quite good results in the task of identifying water bodies using remote sensing data, which will make it possible to fully use this technology in the future both in hydrological studies and in the design and forecasting of fisheries.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of dissolved organic carbon in a subtropical wetland and their implications for methane emissions	GEODERMA												Wetlands represent about one-third of the global soil organic carbon storage and are the largest natural source of atmospheric methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Understanding the factors that influence the carbon dynamics in wetlands, and their influence on methane emission, is therefore important. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a major form of carbon export from wetlands and plays an essential role in the aquatic carbon cycling process. However, constraints on spatial and temporal dynamics of DOC in vertical peat layers and their relationship to wetland methane emissions are still rare. Here we investigated spatiotemporal changes in porewater DOC concentration and optical properties (SUVA(254), E-2/E-3, E-4/E-6) in surface (0-10 cm) and deep (20-30 cm, 50-60 cm, 100-110 cm) peat layers in a subtropical wetland complex, central China, with the aim to explore DOC dynamics and their relationship to methane emissions from wetlands. DOC dynamics and environmental controls were investigated in the context of high-resolution environmental monitoring, including air temperature, rainfall, water table depth, water chemistry, and methane emissions. DOC of surface peat layers generally had higher concentrations, higher aromaticity, lower humification, and greater temporal variations compared to deeper peat layers. During summer floods and high water table conditions, DOC concentrations in the surface peat increased significantly, whilst DOC exports from rivers and lakes also increased synchronously. In contrast, DOC concentrations and spectral properties of deep peat layers remained constant across the sampling months and water table fluctuations. Methane emissions were positively correlated with air temperature and DOC concentration in the porewater of surface peat layers, and negatively correlated with water table depth. Our results suggest that DOC concentration in the porewater of surface peat layers may also have affected the flux of methane emission from wetlands.

The study area, Itumbiara reservoir (Goias State/Brazil) at the beginning of the austral winter, is characterized by the presence of a weak thermal stratification and the passage of several cold fronts from higher latitudes of South America. Sensible and latent heat fluxes were estimated considering the atmospheric boundary layer stability. In situ and MODIS water surface temperature data were used to adjust the coefficients for momentum and heat exchanges between water and atmosphere and spatialize the sensible and latent heat fluxes. The results showed that during a cold front event the sensible heat flux can be up to five times greater than the flux observed before. The latent heat flux tends to decrease during the cold front but increase again after the passage. The highest values of heat loss were observed at littoral zone and some Reservoir's embayment. The heat loss intensification can be separated in two moments: first, during the cold front passage, when the wind speed increases and the air temperature decreases; second, after the cold front passage, with air humidity decreasing. This can be considered a key process to understanding the heat loss in the Itumbiara reservoir. (C) 2013 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity were found at the estuary of the Changjiang, and the photosynthetic products showed distinctive differences from those at other stations. A high contribution of 16:1(n-7) fatty acid (one of the marker compounds of diatoms) indicates the occurrence of a diatom bloom during our observation period. The ratio of low molecular weight (LMW) to high molecular weight (HMW) carbohydrates off the Changjiang was distinctly higher (1.3) than at the other four stations (0.007-0.091). This suggests that mono-/oligosaccharides did not polymerize to polysaccharides smoothly. The high contribution of glucose in the photosynthetic products at this station indicates that the phytoplankton population was in a nutrient-limited condition. In contrast, the low ratio of LMW to HMW carbohydrates and the lower contribution of glucose at other stations, including oligotrophic Kuroshio water, suggest that phytoplankton populations were not nutrient-limited.

Deposition fluxes of airborne NO3-, NH4+ and SO4(2-) to naive pines at the ELW were much higher than in the eastern Sierra Nevada, but several times lower than deposition fluxes to natural and surrogate surfaces at the highly polluted site in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California. Deposition fluxes of NO3- and NH4+ to the natural and surrogate surfaces at the ELW were much higher than deposition of SO4(2-), proving the importance of N compounds in atmospheric dry deposition in this part of the western U.S. A deficit of inorganic anions in materials deposited to various surfaces indicated a possibility of substantial participation of organic acids in atmospheric dry deposition processes. Nylon and paper filters proved to be poor surrogate surfaces for the estimation of ionic dry deposition to conifer branches.

Late Holocene climatic change: Archaeological evidence from the Purna Basin, Maharashtra	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA					International Workshop on Indian Monsoon and Climate Variability During the Holocene	MAY 17-18, 2004	Bangalore, INDIA	Geol Soc India				Recent excavations at two archaeological sites in the Puma Basin of Vidarbha region have brought to light interesting results on the climatic change during the Late Holocene. These sites are located along the Puma River, a major tributary of the Tapi which flows through Amravati, Akola and Buldhana districts and forms a furrow shaped basin with 5 to 50 in thick exposed alluvium. Recent explorations have added 15 new sites to this region. Bhon and Paturda are amongst them. This region experienced prosperity in terms of economic, social and cultural growth during the Satavahana period (200 BC to 200 AD) at Bhon and decadence after about 500 AD, i.e., post-Gupta period up to 900 AD as revealed at Paturda. This down-fall within 1000 years' time span in the most fertile region of Maharashtra was a major set-back. One of the probable reasons for the cultural deterioration may be climate as evident from the archaeological findings from the above-mentioned sites. The present semi-arid zone of the Puma Basin (average annual rainfall - 800 mm) might have experienced substantially increased rainfall during the Late Holocene as indicated by the recovery of charred rice grains, rice husk impressions over bricks, clay lumps etc.																			0016-7622	0974-6889				SEP	2006	68	3					517	526																WOS:000242675200018

In gape-limited predators, body size asymmetries determine the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Due to ontogenetic changes in body size, the intensity of intra- and interspecific interactions may change rapidly between the match situation of a predator-prey system and the mismatch situation in which competition, including competition with the prey, dominates. 2. Based on a physiologically structured population model using the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), analysis was performed on how prey density (bream, Abramis brama), initial size differences in the young-of-the-year (YOY) age cohort of the predator, and phenology (time-gap in hatching of predator and prey) influence the size structure of the predator cohort. 3. In relation to the seasonality of reproduction, the match situation of the predator-prey system occurred when perch hatched earlier than bream and when no gape-size limitations existed, leading to decreased size divergence in the predator age cohort. Decreased size divergence was also found when bream hatched much earlier than perch, preventing perch predation on bream occurring, which, in turn, increased the competitive interaction of the perch with bream for the common prey, zooplankton; i.e. the mismatch situation in which also the mean size of the age cohort of the predator decreased. 4. In between the total match and the mismatch, however, only the largest individuals of the perch age cohort were able to prey on the bream, while smaller conspecifics got trapped in competition with each other and with bream for zooplankton, leading to enlarged differences in growth that increased size divergence. 5. The modelling results were combined with 7 years of field data in a lake, where large differences in the length-frequency distribution of YOY perch were observed after their first summer. These field data corroborate that phenology and prey density per predator are important mechanisms in determining size differences within the YOY age cohort of the predator. 6. The results demonstrate that the switch between competitive interactions and a predator-prey relationship depended on phenology. This resulted in pronounced size differences in the YOY age cohort, which had far-reaching consequences for the entire predator population.

J	FIELDER, PC; KEESEE, BG				FIELDER, PC; KEESEE, BG			RESULTS OF A MOUNTAIN GOAT TRANSPLANT ALONG LAKE CHELAN, WASHINGTON	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												In an attempt to increase the population, marked mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus)(n = 44) were transplanted from Olympic National Park to Lake Chelan in the Cascade Mountains of Washington in 1983 and 1984. To evaluate the success and integration of these individuals into the population, we compiled sightings of the marked mountain goats. Twenty-seven individuals were resighted a total of 95 times following release. Distances moved by released males and females were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Males traveled an average of 19.8 linear km (SE = 10.2) from release sites, compared to 13.9 km (SE = 15.4) for females. Released kids were never seen beyond 5 days after release. Released goats occupied vacant goat range, joined native goat bands within the drainage, or left the drainage. Transplanted goats intermixed with native goats to potentially introduce genetic variability. A minimum of ten kids were born to transplanted nannies during the three summers after initial release. This study showed that collars and ear tags are both inexpensive and effective methods to mark mountain goats for study over an extended period. Further, because many transplanted mountain goats intermixed and bred with members of the local population, the transplant should be considered sucessful.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				NOV	1988	62	5					218	222																WOS:A1988R379900003
J	Järvalt, A; Krause, T; Palm, A				Järvalt, A; Krause, T; Palm, A			Diel migration and spatial distribution of fish in a small stratified lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The diel migration and spatial distribution of fish were explored using six sequential 4-h sample gillnettings in the pelagic and littoral zones of Lake Verevi (Estonia, 12.6 ha, max. depth I I in, hard-water, deoxygenated hypolimnion) in August 2001 and July 2002. Considering abundance, two-thirds of the total fish moved to the littoral zone. The biomass of fish was distributed evenly between the littoral and pelagic zones, where the topmost epilimnion accounted for 80-85% leaving 10-15% for the lower epilimnion in the pelagic zone. Just above the thermocline only some large specimens of perch Percafluviatilis (L.) and roach Rutilus rutilus (L.) (1-5%) during the daytime were captured. No fish movements were recorded under the thermocline. Rudd Scardinius erythrophtalmus (L.) inhabited only the littoral zone; all the other species were captured in both zones. Juvenile perch stayed in the littoral zone, whereas juvenile roach was caught in both zones and was active over a 24-h period. Piscivores, perch and pike Esox lucius L., were inactive in the dark. Perch inhabited mostly the littoral zone and the duration of its activity increased with age. In summer-stratified Lake Verevi, sharp change in the values of oxygen in the metalimnion along with species interaction affected the spatial distribution of fish, while diel migration was light-dependent.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2005	547						197	203		10.1007/s10750-005-4160-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4160-z													WOS:000232760300018
J	Twiss, MR; Twining, BS; Fisher, NS				Twiss, MR; Twining, BS; Fisher, NS			Partitioning of dissolved thallium by seston in Lakes Erie and Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The fate of thallium (Tl) was traced in the epipelagic and coastal waters of Lake Erie (in 2000) and Lake Ontario (in 2001) sampled during the summer period of thermal stratification. Fractionation of Tl-204 bound to particulate matter was conducted to trace the scavenging potential of various seston size ranges (0.2-2 mum, 2-20 mum, and 20210 pm). Added [Tl-204]-Tl(1) scavenged by seston over 1-3 days was 0.34-4.05% in Lake Erie and 0.09-0.21% in Lake Ontario, where scavenging was correlated with suspended particulate matter content and chlorophyll a concentration. There was no consistent trend with respect to Tl scavenging by a particular size fraction, except at coastal sites in Lake Erie where most Tl was scavenged by the 2-20 pm seston. Partition coefficients (K-d) of Tl scavenging by seston in Lake Ontario were 938-1483 L.kg(-1). At the same pelagic site in Lake Ontario, [Tl-204]-dimethylthallium partitioned into seston (K-d = 807 +/- 258) to a lesser degree than added Tl(I) (K-d = 998 +/- 297), a finding consistent with laboratory assays of these two Tl species. These results suggest that the plankton food web plays a role in the geochemical cycle of this toxic metal in the water column of the lower Great Lakes.

J	Finlay, BJ; Esteban, GF				Finlay, BJ; Esteban, GF			Freshwater protozoa: biodiversity and ecological function	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The purpose of this article is to pull together various elements from current knowledge regarding the natural history of free-living protozoa in fresh waters. We define their functional role, set the likely limits of 'biodiversity', and explore how the two may be related. Protozoa are unicellular, phagotrophic organisms, and 16 phyla of protists contain free-living freshwater protozoan species. They are the most important grazers of microbes in aquatic environments and the only grazers of any importance in anoxic habitats. In sediments, ciliates are usually the dominant protozoans. Benthic ciliate biomass accounts for slightly less than 10% of total benthic invertebrate biomass: but ciliate production may equal or even exceed invertebrate production. Freshwater protozoan species are probably ubiquitous, although many may persist locally for long periods in a cryptic stale - as 'potential' rather than 'active' biodiversity. As protozoa are among the largest and most complex of micro-organisms, it follows that bacteria and all other smaller, more numerous microbes are also ubiquitous. The number of protozoan species recorded in local surveys (232) is about 10% of the estimated global species richness (2390). The 'seedbank' of protozoan (and microbial) species ensures that local microbial diversity is never so impoverished that it cannot play its full part in ecosystem functions such as carbon fixation and nutrient cycling.

J	Lin, ZH; Song, JB				Lin Zhenhua; Song Jinbao			Numerical studies on the degeneration of internal waves induced by an initial tilted pycnocline	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The pycnocline in a closed domain is tilted by external wind forcing and tends to restore to a level position when the wind falls. An internal seiche oscillation exhibits if the forcing is weak, otherwise internal surge and internal solitary waves emerge, which serve as a link to cascade energy to small-scale processes. A two-dimensional non-hydrostatic code with a turbulence closure model is constructed to extend previous laboratory studies. The model could reproduce all the key phenomena observed in the corresponding laboratory experiments. The model results further serve as a comprehensive and reliable data set for an in-depth understanding of the related dynamical process. The comparative analyses indicate that nonlinear term favors the generation of internal surge and subsequent internal solitary waves, and the linear model predicts the general trend reasonably well. The vertical boundary can approximately reflect all the incoming waves, while the slope boundary serves as an area for small-scale internal wave breaking and energy dissipation. The temporal evolutions of domain integrated kinetic and potential energy are also analyzed, and the results indicate that about 20% of the initial available potential energy is lost during the first internal wave breaking process. Some numerical tactics such as grid topology and model initialization are also briefly discussed.																			0253-505X	1869-1099				JUL	2014	33	7					27	39		10.1007/s13131-014-0503-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13131-014-0503-9													WOS:000338098400004

The colonial rotifer Conochilus unicornis was a dominant species in the epilimnion, with densities reaching 20 colonies l(-1) (ca. 400 ind. l(-1)). Clearance rates were measured with an in situ Haney Grazing chamber and synthetic microspheres 5, 9 and 23 mum in diameter. At epilimnetic temperatures of around 14 degreesC, mean clearance rates for 5 mum particles ranged from 30 to 65 mul ind.(-1) h (-1). Clearance rates were 2-9 times higher on the 5 mum spheres than on the 9 mum spheres, and C. unicornis almost never fed on the 23 mum spheres. Grazing rates did not change over the diel cycle. Clearance rates declined more than 10-fold as temperatures declined from 14 degreesC in the epilimnion to 7 degreesC in the metalimnion. In the epilimnion, grazing by C. unicornis was more important than grazing by crustaceans in the community, at least on particles less than or equal to9 mum. The results show the importance of grazing by rotifers in lakes, and the significance of spatial variations that influence grazing rates.

Greenhouse gas emissions from Baltic coastal lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Coastal lakes (CL) act as limnetic-beta-oligohaline systems located on non-tidal coastlines in fresh and salt water mixing zone. Owing to considerable terrestrial nutrient input and a high autochthonous productivity CLs release greenhouse gases (GHG) to the ambient atmosphere, however, neither emission from the system was assessed nor controls on the emission were recognized so far. In this study we attempted to quantify diffusive emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O from CLs based on data collected from seven lakes located on a south coast of the Baltic Sea in Poland. Lake water samples were collected with quarterly resolution along salinity, water depth and wind fetch gradients. From our data it emerged that the concentrations of GHGs were determined by temperature. CH4 showed dependence on salinity, lake water depth and wind fetch. N2O was controlled by dissolved O-2 and NO3- and CO2 was largely related to wind fetch. It also appeared that concentrations of N2O and CO2 were influenced by terrestrial nutrient input. The mean fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O for the whole system were 21.7 mg.m(-2).d(-1), 12.7 g.m(-2).d(-1) and 0.74 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively which was equivalent to 7.9 g CH4.m(-2).y(-1), 4.6 kg CO2.m(-2).y(-1) and 269 mg N2O.m(-2).y(-1). CH4 and N2O were released throughout the year and CO2 was predominantly emitted during winter. We showed that diffusive emissions of the GHGs showed relationships to the surface area of the lakes as well as the ratio of catchment area to lake area (CA/LA). The study would benefit from further extension with higher resolution analyses of the lakes over longer timescales and quantification of ebullitive GHG emission (CH4 in particular).

J	Rouse, WR; Oswald, CM; Binyamin, J; Blanken, PD; Schertzer, WM; Spence, C				Rouse, WR; Oswald, CM; Binyamin, J; Blanken, PD; Schertzer, WM; Spence, C			Interannual and seasonal variability of the surface energy balance and temperature of central Great Slave Lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This paper addresses interannual and seasonal variability in the thermal regime and surface energy fluxes in central Great Slave Lake during three contiguous open-water periods, two of which overlap the Canadian Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Enhanced Study ( CAGES) water year. The specific objectives are to compare the air temperature regime in the midlake to coastal zones, detail patterns of air and water temperatures and atmospheric stability in the central lake, assess the role of the radiation balance in driving the sensible and latent heat fluxes on a daily and seasonal basis, quantify magnitudes and rates of the sensible and latent heat fluxes and evaporation, and present a comprehensive picture of the seasonal and interannual thermal and energy regimes, their variability, and their most important controls. Atmospheric and lake thermal regimes are closely linked. Temperature differences between midlake and the northern shore follow a seasonal linear change from 6degreesC colder midlake in June, to 6degreesC warmer in November - December. These differences are a response to the surface energy budget of the lake. The surface radiation balance, and sensible and latent heat fluxes are not related on a day-to-day basis. Rather, from final lake ice melt in mid-June through to mid- to late August, the surface waters strongly absorb solar radiation. A stable atmosphere dominates this period, the latent heat flux is small and directed upward, and the sensible heat flux is small and directed downward into the lake. During this period, the net solar radiation is largely used in heating the lake. From mid- to late August to freeze up in December to early January, the absorbed solar radiation is small, the atmosphere over the lake becomes increasingly unstable, and the sensible and latent heat fluxes are directed into the atmosphere and grow in magnitude into the winter season. Comparing the period of stable atmospheric conditions with the period of unstable conditions, net radiation is 6 times larger during the period of stable atmosphere and the combined latent and sensible heat fluxes are 9 times larger during the unstable period. From 85% to 90% of total evaporation occurs after mid- August, and evaporation rates increase continuously as the season progresses. This rate of increase varies from year to year. The time of final ice melt exerts the largest single control on the seasonal thermal and energy regimes of this large northern lake.

Their concentration at a few localities provides an exceptional opportunity for studying trends species-wide, so long as several important assumptions are fulfilled Observations from 1980 through 1997 indicated that numbers of staging adults approximated 500,000-600,000 in the 1980s, then dropped by about half in the 1990s. Data from the breeding grounds in 1967-1992, including Breeding Bird Surveys, also indicated a general decline had been in progress, but did not indicate any sudden recent changes. The validity and severity of the decline is hard to test because correspondence between population sizes predicted from BBS trends and observations from staging areas is poor. Difficulties in gathering and interpreting data from a species that is easy to study raises questions about our ability to monitor and understand population trends in less amenable species. Whether population fluctuations in Wilson's Phalaropes are related to the availability of habitat in the main breeding range requires confirmation.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					1999	22	1					37	46		10.2307/1521991	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521991													WOS:000083508100005

Fatty acid trophic markers in Lake Baikal phytoplankton: A comparison of endemic and cosmopolitan diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblages	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Recent changes in phytoplankton community in Lake Baikal suggest the reduction in bloom of endemic diatoms takes place. How much these changes affect primary production remains unknown. Fatty acids are suitable biomarkers of the phytoplankton food quality. In our work we present the data of the qualitative and quantitative analysis of fatty acids (FA) in net samples of Lake Baikal phytoplankton. According to microscopic analysis of the samples the main phytoplankton groups were diatoms (Bacillarophyceae), golden algae (Chrysophyceae), green algae (Chlorophyceae), and Dinophytes (Dinophyceae). Visual quantification of cells showed that Synedra acus subsp. radians, Aulacoseira islandica, Synedra ulna, and Aulacoseira baicalensis were dominant diatom species. The first three species are cosmopolitan and the last one is endemic. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the fatty acid biomarker values reflect changes in phytoplankton community structure in Lake Baikal. The trophic markers of the phytoplankton dominated by endemic A. baicalensis were higher compared to the phytoplankton dominated by cosmopolitan S. acus subsp. radians. The long-chain essential FA (LCEFA, %DW) and FA-based food quality index (FQI) for endemic assemblage were 1.85 and 0.75, while for the cosmopolitan assemblage 0.70 and 0.28, correspondingly. Our data suggest that reduction in bloom of endemic A. baicalensis may negatively affect the Lake Baikal ecosystem due to probable lower LCEFA production and, consequently, lower total productivity of the lake.

This study used physical and chemical water quality and stable nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) measurements from zooplankton to examine nitrogen (N) sources and concentrations in four small lakes of Khorezm, Uzbekistan, an arid, highly agricultural region, which is part of the environmentally-impacted Aral Sea Basin. During the 2-year study period, ammonium concentrations were the highest dissolved inorganic N species in all lakes, with a maximum of 3.00 mg N l(-1) and an average concentration of 0.62 mg N l(-1). Nitrate levels were low, with a maximum concentration of 0.46 mg N l(-1) and an average of 0.05 mg N l(-1) for all four lakes. The limited zooplankton delta N-15 values did not correlate with the high loads of synthetic fertilizer applied to local croplands during summer months. These results suggest that the N cycles in these lakes may be more influenced by regional dynamics than agricultural activity in the immediate surroundings. The Amu-Darya River, which provides the main source of irrigation water to the region, was identified as a possible source of the primary N input to the lakes.

There have been recent suggestions claiming that the Baltic Sea Aphanizomenon species may be different from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae found in lakes. In this study, we examined variability in the morphology and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of A. flos-aquae populations along a salinity gradient from a string of lakes to a fjord-like extension of the Baltic Sea to the open Baltic Sea. Morphological differences among the populations were negligible. We found that the Baltic Sea was dominated (25 out of 27 sequences) by one ITS1-S (shorter band of ITS 1 [ITS1]) genotype, which also was found in the lakes. The lake populations of A. flos-aquae tended to be genetically more diverse than the Baltic Sea populations. Since the lake ITS I-S genotypes of A. flos-aquae are continuously introduced to the Baltic Sea via inflowing waters, it seems that only one ITS1 genotype is able to persist in the Baltic Sea populations. The results suggest that one of the ITS1-S genotypes found in the lakes is better adapted to the conditions of the Baltic Sea and that natural selection removes most of the lake genotypes from the Baltic Sea A. flos-aquae populations.

J	Oliveira, EC; Rossetti, DF; Utida, G				Oliveira, Emiliano C.; Rossetti, Dilce F.; Utida, Giselle			Paleoenvironmental Evolution of Continental Carbonates in West-Central Brazil	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												This paper presents a sedimentological and stratigraphical study of Quaternary (Middle to Late Pleistocene/Holocene) continental carbonates outcrops inside Pantanal Basin and its surroundings, especially in Serra da Bodoquena, Pantanal do Miranda and Corumba/Ladario plateau, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, as well as in Serra das Araras, in the state of Mato Grosso. The aim is to understand the depositional paleoenvironments and analyse climate and tectonic influences in their genesis and evolution. The results show that the deposition of these continental carbonates started in the Middle to Late Pleistocene and have continued, with some interruptions, until the present days. Sedimentary successions were identified in the different areas, without complete correlation. Two sedimentary successions separated by an erosional surface were described in Serra da Bodoquena and Serra das Araras. In Corumba and Pantanal do Miranda, only one succession was described. These successions were deposited in elongated lakes parallel to fault planes; small lakes, related plains and plateaus; springs related to cliffs produced by faulting; rivers conditioned by topographic variation. The climatic interpretation, without proper temporal resolution, obtained by the stable-isotope composition and stratigraphic interpretation, indicates alternation of dry and wet periods. The Neoproterozoic faults with their neotectonics and the subsidence of the Pantanal Basin, are the major control for carbonated water flow and development of depositional areas, gradually turning plateaus into slight tilted areas, allowing the evolution of depositional systems from lakes to rivers.

Alice			An ecological study in Utah - Contributions from the Hull Botanical Laboratory 356	BOTANICAL GAZETTE												The region described comprises the greater portion of Salt Lake Co., Utah, and includes the narrow strip of the Great Basin from the Great Salt Lake to the western foothills of the Wasatch Range. The region conveniently falls into 3 main divisions, altitude 4220-10,650 ft.: (1) the lowland or Salt Lake Valley has 2 types of vegetation due to the diverse soil conditions; the soil on the west side of the Jordan River is alkaline and therefore covered by a sparse growth of alkali-tolerant plants, while the soil east of the river is higher, well drained and fertile and is mostly under cultivation. (2) The unglaciated canyons, which have eroded through various limestone formations, show a succession from the grass covered foothills through sage-brush and oak-chaparral to an aspen-spruce forest at their heads. (3) The glaciated canyons, which have eroded through various substrata with perhaps quartz-diorite and Carboniferous limestone as the most prevalent formations, show at the lower altitudes the same vegetational succession as the unglaciated canyons, but ascend to higher elevations and have developed good stands of spruce-fir forest which gives way at about 10,000 ft. to a subalpine flora.																			0006-8071					SEP-DEC	1926	82	1-4					253	285		10.1086/333659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/333659													WOS:000202865200017

At that time, the approximately 210 km long and 40 km wide SE-NW trending Elbe Palaeovalley (EPV) was the main conduit for meltwater from the southern margin of the Scandinavian ice sheet and rivers draining the North European plain. Only few studies investigated the environmental organization of the Northwest European shelves during deglacial sea level rise resulting in vague reconstructions of the drainage systems. Here, a detailed analysis of sediment echo-sounder data and core samples are presented to study the EPV morphology and stratigraphic infill. The valley base is about 65 m below the present sea-level. This SE-NW palaeo-drainage with its braided system developed during the MIS 2 sea level fall and lowstand in a periglacial environment. During deglacial sea-level rise, the EPV evolved into an estuary with tributaries, intertidal and subtidal flats. After the early Holocene (similar to 10 cal ka BP), ongoing sea-level rise drowned the EPV system which became the major sedimentary trap in the southern North Sea. Successive sea level rise and associated changes in the hydrodynamic regime led to three stages of shelf organization that were recorded in the valley infill successions: (1) shallow basin with restricted connections to Atlantic water; (2) the southwestern connection with the Dover Strait; (3) the open marine environment at 5.8 cal ka BP after the drowning of Dogger Bank.

J	Wang, QY; Yi, S; Sun, WK				Wang, Qiuyu; Yi, Shuang; Sun, Wenke			The changing pattern of lake and its contribution to increased mass in the Tibetan Plateau derived from GRACE and ICESat data	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												This paper compares GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) observations to confirm whether the observed gravity increase in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) was primarily caused by lake storage gain, and comprehensively analyses the changing pattern of lake level over 2003-2009. An improved automated method was used to obtain lake-level changes and the underestimation of lake water storage was considered due to lake area expansion and lake density. The result demonstrates that GRACE recorded a mass gain (16.43 +/- 1.65/11.79 +/- 1.25 gt a(-1)) in the total/inner TP, of which lake storage increase accounts for (8.78 +/- 0.75/7.53 +/- 0.56 gt a(-1)) based on ICESat. The northwestern residual may be stored in new lakes and soil moisture as a result of net precipitation gain. According to the character of the lake-level changes, we divide the TP into four subregions. Generally, the changing pattern of lake level concurs with the distribution of precipitation, which is increasing in the inner TP and decreasing in the upstream area of the Indus and Brahmaputra Rivers. An excess of rainfall in the northeastern TP in the summer of 2005 and 2009 caused a simultaneous large increase in water level in many lakes. The correlation of lake changes with precipitation demonstrates that precipitation rather than glacial melt is the main cause of lake-level change in most places. Nonetheless, the meltwater is a considerable supplement for lakes near glaciers such as Selin Co and Nam Co, which partly explains why GRACE indicates a much weaker signal in this region.					; Wang, Qiuyu/KVX-9763-2024; Yi, Shuang/AAK-6411-2021	Wang, Qiuyu/0000-0002-4624-1489; Yi, Shuang/0000-0003-2976-2351; 													0956-540X	1365-246X				OCT	2016	207	1					528	541		10.1093/gji/ggw293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw293													WOS:000384651200033

Informative Correlations among Metrics of Yellowstone Lake Cutthroat Trout Caught by Two Quantitative Methods across Three Recent Decades	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri (YCT) of Yellowstone Lake, in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, is an iteroparous fish and obligate stream spawner. The size and several other attributes of the annual YCT spawning run in one lake tributary, Clear Creek, have been periodically estimated for several decades. The trends in that run's metrics have been assumed to depict the trends in the lake's YCT population as a whole, although such associations had not been substantiated by statistical analyses. The present study revealed strong correlations between metrics of YCT in the run (years 1977-2007) and of prespawner YCT (i.e., mature fish whose excised gonads indicated that the fish would have spawned the next year) caught in gill nets set in various lake locations the preceding fall. Data for both capture methods also revealed a negative effect of spawning population density on YCT somatic growth, which is known to be positively associated with fecundity. This study showed that most metrics of YCT in the Clear Creek spawning run were indicative of those of prespawner YCT in Yellowstone Lake and aided the development of population models that are needed to determine the causal factors in the recent, three-decade population decline of YCT.

The models have the same horizontal resolution and are forced with meteorological observations during mid-April to early October of 2006. The three models obtained qualitatively similar results, although they have differences in physical parameters, numerical scheme, and vertical discretization. Comparison with observations shows that the models can reproduce the time evolution of lake surface temperature reasonably well. All the models produced shallower mixed layers than observations at midlake stations, causing significant errors in simulating the temperatures in the thermocline but performed better near the coast. All the models also reproduced the characteristics of the time variability of the surface currents but quantitatively had substantial errors at subsurface levels. The three models all reproduced the observed spatial pattern of the summer mean near-surface temperatures, with upwelling (colder temperatures) along the north shore and downwelling (warmer temperatures) along the southeastern shore. The models simulated a lake-wide cyclonic circulation occupying a large portion of the lake, consistent with the observed climatology, but showed distinct differences in simulating the smaller gyre in the western corner of the lake. Although POM has half-vertical layers compared to z level models, its performance is comparable or slightly better than other models in most of the measures. During a strong easterly wind event, the performances of the models are similar in simulating the upwelling and downwelling processes in the lake and agree with the expected dynamic response to the strong wind forcing.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019														2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC 31	2010	115								C12076	10.1029/2010JC006269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JC006269													WOS:000285835700003

Malachite green and crystal violet were absorbed on to gamma -Fe2O3@CNM by electrostatic and -interactions. The morphologies, pore structures, surface functional groups, and magnetic properties of gamma -Fe2O3@CNM were characterized by TEM, FTIR, hysteresis regression, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller analysis, zeta potential, XPS, and XRD. The magnetic solid-phase extraction procedure was optimized by extraction pH, absorption time, desorption solvent, and desorption time. The absorption capacities (q(max) values) for malachite green and crystal violet were 34.2 and 27.9 mg g(-1), respectively. After magnetic solid-phase extraction, malachite green and crystal violet were determined by LC-MS/MS. The analytical method was validated with a linear range of 0.02-20 ng mL(-1), enrichment factor of 25.8 and 25.4, method detection limit of 0.004 ng mL(-1), and intra-day precisions of 2.1% and 2.6% for malachite green and crystal violet, respectively. The relative recovery was found to be 73.4-101.5% for malachite green and 83.1-102.7% for crystal violet upon the application of the magnetic solid-phase extraction method to real water samples from lake, spring, sea, fishpond, and industrial waste.Caramelized-carbon-coated magnetic nanoparticles are used as novel extraction medium based on electrostatic and pi -interactions. It is porous, amphiphilic, electronegative, magnetically strong, and features abundant absorption site. These characteristics stimulate mass transfer and result in a useful MSPE method in environmental analysis.					; cheng, shibo/D-9282-2013	chen, jing/0000-0001-5216-3061; 													0026-3672	1436-5073				JUN 5	2020	187	7								10.1007/s00604-020-04346-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00604-020-04346-z								32504270					WOS:000540257000003

Pedogenic evidence of Urmia Lake's maximum expansion in the late Quaternary	CATENA												The Urmia Lake recession, and the resulting increase in vast barren area around it, has been rapid in recent decades and thus has attracted attention of environmentalists and geoscientists alike. However, evidence for its different strandlines and the largest extension of the lake during the late Quaternary has not been reported yet. The principal goals of the current research were to figure out pedological evidence of its maximum expansion during the late Quaternary and mapping out the different strandlines along the western shores of Urmia Lake over time. Thirty-two soil pedons at different landscape positions, geomorphic surfaces and distances from Urmia Lake were studied during autumn in 2013 and 2014. Micromorphological and mineralogical studies were performed for some diagnostic horizons. Results showed along the transect under study three different entities diagnostic of the lake's history (1) lithological discontinuities, (2) saline lacustrine sediments, (3) buried soils. However, almost 2 km from the closest pedon to the lake, no evidence of saline playa sediments were detected. Based on previous chronology results from Urmia Lake, which indicated high lake levels with very low salinity since about 180 ky BP, the sediments of this part of the study area were considered to have been deposited at the same period of time, indicating a maximum expansion of Urmia Lake during the late Quaternary. The current results demonstrate that soil pedons which were situated at various distances from Urmia Lake denote different stages of the lacustrine evolution. Along with the distance from the lake the development of soils increases. Due to a longer and more intensive impact of pedogenic processes on the topstratum the overall soil system becomes more "mature". The study of buried soils and their comparison to upper non-buried soils revealed that in some cases, the buried soils were more evolved than their upper soils or vice versa. Through these observations, the periods of exposure to soil-forming processes after each sedimentation period was detected and schematic diagrams illustrating periods of highstands and lowstands (recessions) of Urmia Lake were reconstructed. This study demonstrates that even though multiple episodes of lake recession were apparent, the level of Urmia Lake increased during hydroclimatic events conducive to lake expansion, which affected the soil evolution due to several fluctuations during the late Quaternary.

Fish community structure in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario: The influence of nutrient levels and invasive species	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Intensive, long-term sampling in the Bay of Quinte with multiple gears (i.e. gill nets, bottom trawls, trap nets and boat electrofishing) allowed examination of the fish community and major fish populations in the context of key stressors up to 2009. Excessive nutrient input and hyper-abundant non-native fish species, White Perch and Alewife, shaped the depreciated fish community of the 1970s. After implementation of phosphorus input control measures and simultaneous winter-kills of the hyper-abundant non-native fish in the late 1970s, Walleye recovered and served to restore a predator-prey balance to the fish community by the late 1980s. However, in the absence of a significant recovery of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in littoral areas, off-shore species (e.g. Alewife and White Perch) still tended to dominate; even in littoral areas. Following establishment of Dreissenid Mussels in the mid-1990s, water transparency increased and SAV increased significantly in littoral areas. This pivotal event led to a shift in the fish community that included an overall decline in Walleye, an increase followed by a decrease in Yellow Perch, and dominance by centrarchids (i.e. Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass) in the nearshore. Round Goby invaded in 1999, proliferated and became important in the diet of piscivores by 2003. The current species assemblage, including the piscivores, is diverse and indicative of a healthy fish community.

In this study, we identified DWAA events, including dry-wet (D-W) alternation events and wet-dry (W-D) alternation events, based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia (GLRCA), and analyzed temporal and spatial variation of DWAA during the period 1976-2015. Over the entire study period, GLRCA experienced an overall wetting trend, and a heavy dry trend was mainly distributed in the southwest. Although both D-W alternation events and W-D alternation events showed a slight decrease at the regional scale, there were two clearly opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996-2015, with a decrease in 1976-1995 and an increase in 1996-2015. Spatially, the variation in the number of D-W alternation events and W-D alternation events exhibited a large heterogeneity. A significant increase in the frequency of D-W alternation events and W-D alternation events was observed in the southwest of arid climate zone, which may be attributed to the increased frequency of dry months and wet months in the region. This study in DWAA events is of importance to the implementation of water resources management, disaster prevention and mitigation policies in the GLRCA under the challenge of future climate change.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2022	613		A						128333	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128333													WOS:000966528700002

Reclaiming Mountain Lake: Applying environmental repossession in Biigtigong Nishnaabeg territory, Canada	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE												The concept of environmental repossession responds to a global movement led by Indigenous peoples to reclaim their territories and ways of life. As Indigenous wellness is intimately tied to relationships to land, processes of environmental repossession are a means to revitalize knowledge systems, identities and relationships that foster strong and healthy communities. Due to historic and ongoing forces of dispossession, the Anishinaabe community of Biigtigong Nishnaabeg has experienced limited access to Mountain Lake, a culturally and historically significant place in their ancestral territory. In the summer of 2018, the Chief and Council of Biigtigong constructed two cabins along the shores of Mountain Lake for community use and, one year later, hosted a week-long camp to bring Elders, youth and band staff together in this place. Drawing from 15 in-depth interviews with participating community members, this study documented the planning and implementation of the cabins and camp at Mountain Lake and examined the community meanings of this process. The findings suggest that the cabins and camp functioned as a local process of environmental repossession through multiple and interconnected steps to reclaim access to Mountain Lake, reintroduce the community to this place and begin remaking community relationships to this land. As Indigenous communities globally seek to reclaim their territories and rights to land, this article speaks to the tensions of this work and the structures that support its practice locally.

The degree of methylation of brGDGTs has a strong relationship with the ambient temperature, and numerous brGDGT temperature reconstructions have been generated ranging from the tropics to high latitudes and over a variety of time scales. However, this proxy still requires calibration and validation in Arctic settings, which are among the most climatically sensitive regions on Earth. Here, we investigate Lake 578, a dimictic lake located in southern Greenland, and examine brGDGTs in a sediment core, surface sediments, catchment soils, and settling particulate matter (SPM). Our results suggest that sedimentary brGDGTs are mainly produced in the water column, and the SPM MBT05ME (Methylation of Branched Tetraethers) values are significantly correlated with depth-integrated summer water temperature. Here, we provide the first lake water temperature-brGDGT calibration based on the MBT05ME index, with an improved root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.52 degrees C. Like previous studies, we find that watershed soils differ in brGDGT distributions from those of the SPM or lake sediments, and we conclude that most brGDGT production in Lake 578 is occurring in situ. In the sediment core, we observe a significant cooling trend in the uppermost 7 cm, but this result is unrealistic because it conflicts with the instrumental temperature record from this region. This "core-top cooling" is associated with increasing relative abundances of brGDGT-IIa and IIIa, and with decreasing brGDGT-Ia, and we speculate that it may be driven by diagenetic effects or changing microbial communities in the sediment subsurface. The anomalous "core-top cooling" phenomenon, which is noted in numerous other published lacustrine brGDGT records, highlights the need for further studies of brGDGTs in modern and recent lake sediments. Constraining the source organisms of brGDGTs and better understanding the relationship between brGDGTs and environmental factors are essential, prior to their use in paleoclimate reconstructions.

J	Nguyen, HVM; Hur, J; Shin, HS				Nguyen, Hang Vo-Minh; Hur, Jin; Shin, Hyun-Sang			Changes in Spectroscopic and Molecular Weight Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Matter in a River During a Storm Event	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics were investigated during a storm event in the Kyungan River using UV-visible, fluorescence spectroscopy, resin fractionation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Water samples were collected at nine sampling times to reflect a variation of the river water level. A dramatic increase was observed for chemical oxygen demand (COD) versus biochemical oxygen demand, suggesting that non-biodegradable organic components may be more contained in the organic matters driven by the storm. Specific UV absorbance values increased from 2.15 to 3.16 L/mgC-m, reaching the maximum level at the highest water level. The storm runoff resulted in the reduction of protein-like fluorescence (PLF), the increase of fulvic-like and humic-like fluorescence for the synchronous fluorescence spectra of DOM. Weight-average molecular weight (MWw) values increased from 1,100 to 1,510 Da due to the increment of high MW fractions in the SEC chromatograms. Overall changes in DOM composition may be explained by the inflow of soil-derived DOM from the upstream basins brought by the storm. The humification index (HIX) exhibited a positive correlation with MWw values, suggesting that HIX may be suggested to a prediction descriptor for DOM MW during the storm event. PLF presented a negative correlation with DOM MW, suggesting that protein-like fluorescent compounds are associated with low MW components in the river. More input of humic substances by the storm runoff appears to shift DOM into a higher MW value as revealed by a positive correlation between MWw and hydrophobic fraction.

John; Macleod, Alison			Annually resolved events of Younger Dryas glaciation in Lochaber (Glen Roy and Glen Spean), Western Scottish Highlands	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												This paper presents the results of micromorphological analysis of laminated sediments that accumulated in ice-dammed lakes in Lochaber (Glen Roy and vicinity) during the Younger Dryas (Loch Lomond) Stadial. These lakes were responsible for the formation of the famous 'Parallel Roads of Glen Roy' (Agassiz, 1840), prominent shorelines cut into the valley sides of Glen Roy and adjacent valleys. Annually deposited (varved) layers, which can be distinguished from other rhythmites by micromorphological examination, have enabled the construction of a varve chronology which underpins the glacial history of the region, the duration of the lake stands and rates of ice margin advance and retreat. The lake system existed for a total of 515 a. During a rise in lake levels, the lowermost (260 m), middle (325 m) and highest (350 m) lakes existed for minimal periods of 191, 112 and 116 a, respectively, and the fall of lake levels from 350 m to 260 m took 95 years. Ice advance rates of between 13.4 and 41.9 m a(-1) are inferred, while ice retreat is estimated to have been similar to 38.5 m a(-1). A provisional correlation between the Lochaber varve and GRIP ice core records suggests that the lakes started to form at ca. 12 165 a BP, in turn implying that the Loch Lomond Readvance limits in this area were not achieved until late in the Younger Dryas interval, a conclusion which does not accord with that based on numerical model simulations.

In this paper, we test these hypotheses by analyzing new representative outcrops located around Icalma (38 degrees 50'S) and Puyehue (40 degrees 40'S) lakes by a pluri-methodological approach. Our data demonstrate that the andosol parent material has the typical mineralogical and geochemical signature of the regional volcanism and that these deposits are post-glacial in age. The grain size of the deposits and the morphology of the coarse grains evidence that most of these particles haven't been re-transported by wind but are direct volcanic ash falls deposited throughout the Late Glacial and Holocene. Because of the prevailing westerly winds, most of these volcanic ashes have been transported to the East. Following the deposition of the volcanic particles, weathering and pedogenetic processes have transformed part of the volcanic glasses and plagioclases into allophane and have wiped out the original layering. This work demonstrates that most of the andosols that occur in the Andes and in the eastern part of the Intermediate Depression of south-central Chile are developed on volcanic ashes directly deposited by successive volcanic eruptions throughout the Late Glacial and Holocene.

Pollutant removal by an integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland treating simulated river water by reoxygenation	TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												The effects and mechanism of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, and phosphorus concentration removal by an integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland were studied in the wetland system during one inlet-outlet operating period, in two typical stages (each stage is connective 24 h, sampled once every 4 h). The concentration of ammonia decreased along the flow direction in the system, while levels of nitrate (NO3--N) increased. In one operating period, total nitrogen (TN) concentration fell with rising operation time due to evacuative reoxygenation. The TN and NH3-N removal rates in the system were 26.6% and 97.5%, respectively. COD decreased rapidly in the early stages and more gradually in the direction of water flow of the wetland system. Average total phosphorus (TP) removal rate was 20.71%. TN and NO3--N levels in water of the wetland had a tendency to decline gradually with increasing operation time. Ammonia concentrations displayed only a small variation with operation time. The results also indicated that the wetland was able to maintain its temperature. The oxygen content differed during the various operating stages and exerted a marked influence on COD, TP, and TN removal.

J	Zhang, Z; Wu, ZB; He, L				Zhang, Zheng; Wu, Zhenbin; He, Li			The accumulation of alkylphenols in submersed plants in spring in urban lake, China	CHEMOSPHERE												The concentrations of alkylphenols (APs) were investigated in water, sediments and submersed macrophytes from the Moon Lake, Wuhan city, China. The water samples contained APs, ranging up to 26.4 mu g l(-1) for nonylphenol (NP) and 0.68 mu g l(-1) for octylphenol (OP). APs were found in the sediment samples with concentrations ranging from 4.08 to 14.8 for NP and from 0.22 to 1.25 mu g l(-1) dry weight for OP. The samples from the site near former sewage inlet showed the highest concentrations of APs in both water and sediments. The results of distribution pattern and dynamics of NP and OP in submersed macrophytes of the Moon Lake showed that the two pollutants were all found in Myriophyllum verticillatum, Elodea nuttallii, Ceratophyllum oryzetorum, and Potamageton crispus collected from the Moon Lake. For NP, M. verticillatum had the highest capacity of accumulation, followed by E. nuttallii, C. oryzetorum and P. crispus. However the distribution pattern of OP differed from that of NP, and the highest amount of accumulation was observed in E. nuttallii, followed by M. verticillatum, P. crispus, and C. oryzetorum. The temporal pattern of APs was also observed in submersed macrophytes from March to May, and the highest accumulation period was in May. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	WANG, N; ECKMANN, R				WANG, N; ECKMANN, R			DISTRIBUTION OF PERCH (PERCA-FLUVIATILIS L) DURING THEIR 1ST YEAR OF LIFE IN LAKE CONSTANCE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The distribution and behaviour of larval and juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) were studied for two years in large, deep Lake Constance. After hatching larvae were transported by water currents to the open water. The majority of larvae remained in the pelagic zone for about one month. In both years, their return to the littoral zone coincided with the decline of pelagic zooplankton abundance. After returning to the littoral zone, juveniles stayed among submerged macrophytes within 5 m depth and lived apart from larger perch which lived at depths of 6-20 m. By late summer, juveniles changed their distribution pattern: during the day they stayed intensively close to piers and ports, but increased their swimming activity at dusk, cruising among shallow and deep waters and feeding on zooplankton, and rested on the bottom at night. This behaviour appears to be related to the decrease of inshore food resources and to the presence of predators in deeper water. 0+ perch left the littoral zone and moved into deep waters when autumnal mixing began in late October. They overwintered near the bottom at depths of more than 30 m. During most of the year, juvenile and adult perch were separated from each other. But as soon as they occupied the same habitat, the occurrence of cannibalism increased.																			0018-8158					MAR 18	1994	277	3					135	143		10.1007/BF00007295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007295													WOS:A1994NC11400001

The sites include Mayville in the westernmost corner of the state, West Haverstraw just north of the metropolitan New York area, and Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks. The elemental compositions of the aerosols at these sites are compared. The composition of regional aerosols is investigated using backward-in-time air trajectories to classify samples from Mayville and West Haverstraw into six regions: I, southern Ontario; II, Great Lakes; III, Ohio River Valley; IV, central Pennsylvania; V, western New York; and VI, East Coast urban. Region VI was characterized by high cocentrations of V and Sb and relatively low concentrations of the other elements and sulfate. Region III had the highest cncentrations of sulfate (28 .mu.g m-3) and Se (5 ng m-3); both were around 7.5 times higher than for region VI. Crustal elements and bromine were comparable for all regions varying by a factor of two or less. Elemental ratios were explored as tracers for the various regions and the data are also to test some of the basic assumptions in a proposed multi-element tracer system.																			1352-2310	1873-2844					1987	21	5					1033	1044		10.1016/0004-6981(87)90232-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(87)90232-0													WOS:A1987H547800003

In Texas (USA), P. parvum blooms occur in inland brackish waters and have recently increased in frequency and magnitude. Here, we document the development and termination of a localized bloom in Lake Whitney during spring. Initially water conditions were non-toxic, and then became toxic to cladocerans and fish. As the bloom peaked, P. parvum populations reached similar to 38 million cells L-1, and prymnesiophytes dominated the phytoplankton assemblage, comprising similar to 92% of the biomass. In April, a sizeable inflow event terminated this bloom, completely removed toxicity and decreased P. parvum densities by 52%, under a 30% hydraulic dilution. The lake level rose, but no substantial outflow occurred. This demonstrated that flushing losses, previously shown to be important for P. parvum bloom termination elsewhere, did not contribute to the termination of this bloom. Following the inflow event, P. parvum might have lost its competitive edge due to the cessation of toxin production as a result of nutrient loading. Despite positive specific growth rates for P. parvum, population density did not increase. During the non-toxic, post-inflow conditions, zooplankton biomass increased similar to 225-fold, suggesting that grazing losses contributed to the offset of P. parvum reproductive growth. Our findings emphasize the importance of inflows to P. parvum bloom dynamics, while demonstrating the impact of hydraulic dilution on bloom termination.

No canola cultivars are marketed as having resistance to SSR. Field trials were established in Red Lake Falls, MN (2001, 2003, and 2004) and Carrington, ND (2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004) to evaluate canola cultivars for resistance to SSR. These cultivars also were evaluated for resistance to SSR under controlled conditions using the following methods: petiole inoculation technique (PIT), detached leaf assay (DLA), and oxalic acid assay (OAA). Significant (P <= 0.05) differences were detected among cultivars for SSR and yield in the field trials, with SSR levels varying from low to high among years and locations. Cultivars with consistent high levels and low levels of SSR in the field trials were identified. Significant (P <= 0.05) differences were detected among cultivars; for SSR using the PIT and OAA methods, but not the DLA method. No significant (P <= 0.05) correlations between SSR levels in the controlled studies with SSR levels in the field trials were detected; however, significant negative correlations were detected between SSR area under the disease process curve values from the PIT method and yield from Carrington, ND in 2001 and 2002. Although the PIT and OAA methods differentiated cultivars, neither method was able to predict the reaction of cultivars to SSR in the field, indicating that field screening for SSR resistance is still critical for the development of resistant cultivars.					; Bradley, Carl/LFU-8606-2024	Bradley, Carl/0000-0002-8334-0750; 													0191-2917					FEB	2006	90	2					215	219		10.1094/PD-90-0215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-0215								30786415					WOS:000234938000013

Dramatic fluctuations in algal biomass patterns occurred in Lake Taihu, with a notable surge in blooms magnitude during 2016-2020 followed by a sudden decrease in algal biomass in the period of 2021-2023. The mechanisms underlying this variability are not well understood. Here, a process-based model was developed to quantify the drivers behind the transition from higher to lower algal biomass patterns. The lower spring photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) during 2021-2023 decreased algal photosynthesis and algal biomass. The subsequent weak phytoplankton-phosphorus (from the sediment) feedback, resulted in decreased phosphate concentration, which in turn further reduced algal biomass. This mechanism underscores the importance of understanding internal nutrient dynamics and the need for stricter measures to reduce external loads to weaken the internal feedback loop between sediment phosphorus release and algal bloom outbreaks, and further to mitigate the effects of climate change on lake ecosystems.					; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012; Brookes, Justin/G-4270-2013; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014	Qin, Boqiang/0000-0003-3977-4903; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2025	61	6							e2024WR039014	10.1029/2024WR039014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR039014													WOS:001513184600001

We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) How large are soil seed banks along the successional gradient? (2) Do the seed banks reflect the actual standing vegetation or do they remember earlier successional stages or do they represent already the next successional stage? Soil samples were collected in late spring and a germination experiment was performed. The differences in seed bank size between succession stages and soil layers were proved by a two-way ANOVA. Similarities between seed bank and standing vegetation were tested by the Morisita-Horn index. Our results indicated that seed bank size significantly increased along the chronosequence, from 273 seedlings/m(2) in the pioneer stage, 820 seedlings/m(2) in the early successional stage, to 3527 and 3674 seedlings/m(2) in the late and old successional stage, respectively. The seed bank size was correlated with the vegetation cover along the successional gradient. The early succession stages were more similar to the standing vegetation as the later stages. A persistent soil seed bank has been found all along the successional gradient; however, size and composition changed from the pioneer to the old successional stage. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The impact of hydrology on the summer plankton community composition in 100 floodplain lakes was studied by multivariate analyses (TWINSPAN, FLEXCLUS, DCA) of relative abundance data of plankton. The phyto- and zooplankton community composition in floodplain lakes is clearly related to hydrology, relevant nutritional resources and habitat characteristics, mainly via input of N and P from the eutrophic main channels during floods. The plankton species richness was related to the complexity of habitats formed by the presence of aquatic vegetation. There was a good agreement between the ecological and the environmental characterization of site groups. Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and filter-feeding zooplankton taxa associated with open water are characteristic for floodplain lakes with a long annual flood duration, low Si/N and Si/P ratios, and a poorly developed aquatic vegetation. Bacillariophyceae and scraping zooplankton taxa associated with aquatic macrophytes are characteristic for floodplain lakes with a short annual flood duration, high Si/N and Si/P ratios, and a well-developed aquatic vegetation. It is concluded that the restoration of connections between rarely flooded lakes and the highly eutrophic main channels of the Lower Rhine and Meuse will result in hypertrophic conditions and a reduced plankton diversity in these lakes.					van Katwijk, Marieke/B-1709-2012; van Katwijk, Marieke M./B-1709-2012; van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011	van Katwijk, Marieke M./0000-0002-4482-5835; 													0142-7873					APR	1994	16	4					351	373		10.1093/plankt/16.4.351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/16.4.351													WOS:A1994NH96200004

Intense morphological examination and comparative morphological assessment with the genera Fischerella and Hapalosiphon and all the known strains of the genus Westiellopsis indicated that the strain HPS differed in morphology with the closely related strains in trichome arrangement, size of vegetative cells, heterocytes, monocytes, and number of rows of main filaments. There were also differences in the habitat preference, being aquatic rather than terrestrial or subaerial. Intense ecological characterization of the habitat was performed through measurements of important physicochemical characteristics. 16S rRNA gene-based identification and phylogenetic placement indicated conclusively that the strain HPS was different from the most closely related strain Westiellopsis prolifica SAG 16.93. Phylogenetic inferences drawn in between all the branched heterocytous forms and subsequent 16S-23S ITS analyses and folding of the secondary structures revealed an entirely new form that is unknown till now. Subsequent nifD and rbcL gene-based phylogenetic assessments indicated that strain HPS is phylogenetically different from all the other previously known species of true branching cyanobacteria, along with also pointing toward the huge database inconsistencies in case of true branched cyanobacteria.

This size shift has been attributed to both direct (e.g. physiological) or indirect (especially increased predation) impacts. To provide further information on the role of predation, we compiled results from several studies of subtropical Uruguayan lakes using three different approaches: (i) field observations from two lakes with contrasting fish abundance, Lakes Rivera and Rod, (ii) fish exclusion experiments conducted in in-lake mesocosms in three lakes, and (iii) analyses of the Daphnia egg bank in the surface sediment of eighteen lakes. When fish predation pressure was low due to fish kills in Lake Rivera, large-bodied Daphnia appeared. In contrast, small-sized cladocerans were abundant in Lake Rod, which exhibited a typical high abundance of fish. Likewise, relatively large cladocerans (e.g. Daphnia and Simocephalus) appeared in fishless mesocosms after only 2 weeks, most likely hatched from resting egg banks stored in the surface sediment, but their abundance declined again after fish stocking. Moreover, field studies showed that 9 out of 18 Uruguayan shallow lakes had resting eggs of Daphnia in their surface sediment despite that this genus was only recorded in three of the lakes in summer water samples, indicating that Daphnia might be able to build up populations at low risk of predation. Our results show that medium and large-sized zooplankton can occur in subtropical lakes when fish predation is removed. The evidence provided here collectively confirms the hypothesis that predation, rather than high-temperature induced physiological constraints, is the key factor determining the dominance of small-sized zooplankton in warm lakes.

C	Kucukgul, EY		Incecik, S; Ekinci, E; Yardim, F; Bayram, A		Kucukgul, EY			Chemical composition of rain water at west of Turkey	AIR QUALITY MANAGMENT: AT URBAN, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALES					10th Regional IUAPPA Conference	SEP 23-26, 1997	ISTANBUL, TURKEY	IUAPPA				Acidic deposition, or acidic rainwater as it is commonly known, occurs when emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen react in the atmosphere with water, oxygen, and oxidants to form various acidic compounds. These compounds then fall to the earth in either dry form (such as gas and particles) or wet form (such as rain, snow, and fog). Prevailing winds transport the compounds, sometimes hundreds of miles, before they become joined with water droplets to form acid rain (Russell, 1987). For that reason, acid rain can also be a problem in areas far from the polluting smokestacks. Dry deposition is usually more abundant near the cities and industrial areas where the pollutants are released. Air pollutants arise from the use of coal in the production of electricity, from base-metal smelting, and fuel combustion in vehicles. Overall, over 20 million tons SO2 and NOX are emitted into atmosphere each year. Although natural sources of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides do exist, more than %90 of the sulfur and 95% of the nitrogen emissions occurring in eastern North America are of human origin. About 40% of nitrogen oxides come from transportation (cars, trucks, buses, train), about 25% from thermoelectric generating stations, and the balance from other industrial, commercial, and residential combustion processes. The interaction between the water droplets and the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere gives rain a pH of 5.6, making even clean rain slightly acidic. Other natural sources of acids and bases in the atmosphere may lower or rise the pH of unpolluted rain. However, when rain contains pollutants, especially sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, the rain water can become very acidic. Acid rain causes acidification of lakes and streams and contributes to damage of trees. In addition, acid rain accelerates the decay of building materials and paints, including irreplaceable buildings, statues, and sculptures that are part of our nation's cultural heritage. Prior to falling to the earth, SO2 and NOX gases and their particulate matter derivatives, sulfates, and nitrates, contribute to visibility degradation and impact public health. Concentrations of major ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chlorine, nitrate, sulfate, orthophosphate) and electrical conductivity, suspended matter, total hardness, chemical oxygen demand, alkalinity and acidity were analyzed in rain water samples collected for 18 months (1995-1996). Samples were collected near an industrial area on Blacksea cost, Aegean Cost and Mediterranean Cost; Eregli, Izmir, Balikesir and Antalya respectively. Although concentrations decrease with precipitation amount due to dilution in heavy rain, precipitation amount is not the only factor affecting concentrations of ions in precipitation. The main source of ions in wet deposition is the emissions from nearby industries.																					0-87849-772-2				1997							290	294																WOS:000074636300047
J	BECKERLING, W; BISCHOFF, A				BECKERLING, W; BISCHOFF, A			OCCURRENCE AND COMPOSITION OF RELICT MINERALS IN MICROMETEORITES FROM GREENLAND AND ANTARCTICA - IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR ORIGINS	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The mineralogy and chemistry of 161 micrometeorites from Greenland (100-200 mu m in size) and 66 micrometeorites from Antarctica (50-100 mu m in size) were studied in order to obtain information about the origin of micrometeorites. Within 66 of these 227 ''particles, 140 relict olivines and 84 relict pyroxenes were found. In addition, other relict minerals were identified, including perovskite, chromite Fe,Ni-metal magnetite and sulfides. The textures of micrometeorites showing relict minerals range from fine- grained porous particles to spherical particles. Relict minerals escaped melting during atmospheric heating and, therefore, they are the best candidates for a comparable study with other extraterrestrial material. Based on our study of relict grains from micrometeorites, we suggest a close relationship of most of the particles to various types of carbonaceous chondrites. Only a few particles are probably related to ordinary chondrites. We did not find any relict grains that may be related to minerals common in achondrites and stony iron meteorites. Since the majority of asteroids appear to consist of materials related to carbonaceous chondrites, we conclude that, statistically micrometeorites with relict grains in the studied size range of 50-200 mu m represent much better the abundance of distinct types of asteroids than the abundance of distinct groups of meteorites as revealed by the statistics of modern falls.																			0032-0633					MAR-APR	1995	43	3-4					435	449		10.1016/0032-0633(94)00175-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0032-0633(94)00175-Q													WOS:A1995RF85300020
J	BAHR, A; SCHULTE, G				BAHR, A; SCHULTE, G			DISTRIBUTION OF SHORE BUGS (HETEROPTERA-SALDIDAE) IN BRACKISH AND MARINE LITTORAL OF NORTH-AMERICAN PACIFIC COAST	MARINE BIOLOGY												Shore bugs (Heteroptera: Saldidae) were collected during summer 1973 along the Pacific Coast of North America between the arctic and the subtropical regions. The field studies were aimed at determining the species-specific upper and lower limits of distribution in the littoral, and the distribution range of these species in estuaries. The saldids inhabiting the littoral zones can be divided into 2 groups: coastal species and inland species. Species found in the supralittoral occur at inland localities as well and can either tolerate limnetic-oligohaline conditions (Salda littoralis, S. provancheri, Saldula coxalis) or are confined to habitats along salt lakes (Pentacora signoreti). Inhabitants of the eulittoral can either occur in the supralittoral and inland localities as well and are holeuryhaline (Saldula palustris, S. pallipes) or have disconnected inland populations (S. nigrita), or they live exclusively in the intertidal zones. In the subarctic, coastal species are distributed from the intertidal zones to inland limnetic habitats. The increasing aridity of southern climatic zones may act as a limiting factor confining the distribution of coastal species to the coast. The distribution of inland species may be influenced by competition with the coastal forms.																			0025-3162	1432-1793					1976	36	1					37	46		10.1007/BF00388427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00388427													WOS:A1976BT32400007

El'gygytgyn Sci Party	Depositional dynamics in the El'gygytgyn Crater margin: implications for the 3.6Ma old sediment archive	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The combination of permafrost history and dynamics, lake level changes and the tectonical framework is considered to play a crucial role for sediment delivery to El'gygytgyn Crater Lake, NE Russian Arctic. The purpose of this study is to propose a depositional framework based on analyses of the core strata from the lake margin and historical reconstructions from various studies at the site. A sedimentological program has been conducted using frozen core samples from the 141.5m long El'gygytgyn 5011-3 permafrost well. The drill site is located in sedimentary permafrost west of the lake that partly fills the El'gygytgyn Crater. The total core sequence is interpreted as strata building up a progradational alluvial fan delta. Four macroscopically distinct sedimentary units are identified. Unit 1 (141.5-117.0 m) is comprised of ice-cemented, matrix-supported sandy gravel and intercalated sandy layers. Sandy layers represent sediments which rained out as particles in the deeper part of the water column under highly energetic conditions. Unit 2 (117.0-24.25 m) is dominated by ice-cemented, matrix-supported sandy gravel with individual gravel layers. Most of the Unit 2 diamicton is understood to result from alluvial wash and subsequent gravitational sliding of coarse-grained (sandy gravel) material on the basin slope. Unit 3 (24.25-8.5 m) has ice-cemented, matrix-supported sandy gravel that is interrupted by sand beds. These sandy beds are associated with flooding events and represent near-shore sandy shoals. Unit 4 (8.5-0.0 m) is ice-cemented, matrix-supported sandy gravel with varying ice content, mostly higher than below. It consists of slope material and creek fill deposits. The uppermost metre is the active layer (i.e. the top layer of soil with seasonal freeze and thaw) into which modern soil organic matter has been incorporated. The nature of the progradational sediment transport taking place from the western and northern crater margins may be related to the complementary occurrence of frequent turbiditic layers in the central lake basin, as is known from the lake sediment record. Slope processes such as gravitational sliding and sheet flooding occur especially during spring melt and promote mass wasting into the basin. Tectonics are inferred to have initiated the fan accumulation in the first place and possibly the off-centre displacement of the crater lake.

Infestation by Ligula was found to have no effect on the autumnal offshore migration of smaller gudgeon (median length 60 mm, mainly 1+ in age) and roach (median length 56 mm, mainly 1+ in age), although it was previously found to affect the migration of larger, older gudgeon (median length 90 mm, mainly 2+ in age) (the offshore migration of larger roach was not studied). Infestation also had no effect on the summer vertical distributions of smaller gudgeon and roach, but there was a significant effect on larger gudgeon and roach (median length 83 mm, mainly 2+ in age). Within the size ranges studied, larger fish of each species harboured larger parasites, but the precise relationship between host size and parasite size differed significantly. The effect, or otherwise, of Ligula on roach and gudgeon distributions is not related solely to the relative weights of the parasite and host.

J	Yan, GX; Wu, ZY; Li, DH; Xiao, H				Yan, Guixia; Wu, Zhiyong; Li, Denghua; Xiao, Heng			A comparative frequency analysis of three standardized drought indices in the Poyang Lake basin, China	NATURAL HAZARDS												Regional drought frequency analysis was carried out in the Poyang Lake basin (PLB) from 1960-2014 based on three standardized drought indices: the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the standardized Palmer drought index (SPDI). Drought events and characteristics were extracted. A Gumbel-Hougaard (GH) copula was selected to construct the bivariate probability distribution of drought duration and severity, and the joint return periods (T (a) ) were calculated. Results showed that there were 50 (50 and 40) drought events in the past 55 years based on the SPI (SPEI and SPDI), and 9 (8 and 10) of them were severe with T (a) more than 10 years, occurred in the 1960s, the 1970s and the 2000s. Overall, the three drought indices could detect the onset of droughts and performed similarly with regard to drought identification. However, for the SPDI, moisture scarcity was less frequent, but it showed more severe droughts with substantially higher severity and longer duration droughts. The conditional return period (Ts|d) was calculated for the spring drought in 2011, and it was 66a and 54a, respectively, based on the SPI and SPDI, which was consistent with the record. Overall, the SPI, only considering the precipitation, can as effectively as the SPEI and SPDI identify the drought process over the PLB under the present changing climate. However, drought is affected by climate and land-cover changes; thus, it is necessary to integrate the results of drought frequency analysis based on different drought indices to improve the drought risk management.					xiao, heng/NFS-4442-2025														0921-030X	1573-0840				MAR	2018	91	1					353	374		10.1007/s11069-017-3133-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-017-3133-7													WOS:000424680300018

The phreatic parts of cave systems develop close to the karst water table, which depends on the spring position, which in turn is generally related to the valley bottom. Thus, caves are directly linked with the geomorphic evolution of the surface and reflect valley deepening. The sediments deposited in the caves help to reconstruct the morphologic succession and the paleoclimatic evolution. Moreover, they are the only means to date the caves and thus the landscape evolution. Caves appear as soon as there is an emersion of limestone from the sea and a water table gradient. Mesozoic and early tertiary paleokarsts within the alpine range prove of these ancient emersions. Hydrothermal karst seems to be more widespread than previously presumed. This is mostly due to the fact that usually, hydrothermal caves are later reused (and reshaped) by meteoric waters. Rock-ghost weathering is described as a new cave genesis agent. On the contrary, glaciers hinder cave genesis processes and fill caves. They mainly influence cave genesis indirectly by valley deepening and abrasion of the caprock. All present datings suggest that many alpine caves (excluding paleokarst) are of Pliocene or even Miocene age. Progress in dating methods (mainly the recent evolution with cosmogenic nuclides) should permit, in the near future, to date not only Pleistocene, but also Pliocene cave sediments absolutely.					; audra, philippe/HGD-1087-2022	Audra, Philippe/0000-0001-9152-9935; Hoblea, Fabien/0000-0003-3857-6155; 													0583-6050	1580-2612					2007	36	1					53	67																WOS:000246800700007

Quantities and the chemical composition of epiphyton on the roots of floating aquatic macrophytes were measured in Lake Calado, an Amazon floodplain lake. Growth of epiphytic algae following physical disturbance and losses of epiphyton due to grazing and storms were investigated. 2. Deposition of silt from invading river water decreased chlorophyll and nutrient content (%C, %N, %P) of epiphyton during rising water. N:P ratios of epiphyton indicated that proximity to the river increased supplies of phosphorus. Attached algal biomass per unit root tissue was higher overall during the falling water period, when light was greater, storms less frequent, and new host plant tissue produced more slowly. 3. Epiphytic algal biomass at the margins of floating meadows exceeded that of the phytoplankton in the open water on a per unit area basis. Increases in attached algal chlorophyll ranged from two- to ten-fold over 1 week. Artificial denudation of roots was followed by rapid regrowth of attached algae, leading, after 1 week, to four-fold increases in chorophyll over the pre-denuded state. 4. Wind-blown macrophytes experienced an episodic loss of 70% of epiphytic material in less than 1 h. Particulate material lost from roots grazed by snails included root tissue and contained significantly more carbon than material lost from ungrazed roots.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1989	22	3					479	494		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01120.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01120.x													WOS:A1989CA92500012
J	Graham, NE; Hughes, MK				Graham, Nicholas E.; Hughes, Malcolm K.			Reconstructing the Mediaeval low stands of Mono Lake, Sierra Nevada, California, USA	HOLOCENE												Palaeosimulations of Mono Lake covering the past 2 kyr have been conducted using a water balance model forced with tree-ring derived inflow estimates. The results show two low stands, during the ninth to tenth a rid twelfth to thirteenth centuries, th at agree well in timing a rid magnitude with those described by Stine (1987, 1990, 1994) on the basis of geomorphic evidence and relict trees and shrubs exposed on Mono Lake's artific ially exposed shorelands. The lake simulations provides independent corroboration of the timing and magnitude of Stine's drought-induced low stands and supports the accuracy of tree-ring-derived estimates of Mediaeval precipitation and runoff reductions in the central Sierra Nevada. Specifically, we estimate that during, the two Mediaeval droughts, centennial average precipitation and river runoff in the central Sierra Nevada reached as low as 75% of the twentieth century values, with multidecade averages as low as 60-65%. In both magnitude and duration, these droughts far exceed anything experienced in the region during modern times. An analysis of the spatial patterns of reconstructed drought indices shows that the particular 'two drought' Mono Lake low stand signal was focused over central and southern California, indicating the dominant role of boreal winter precipitation deficits. In this respect, the 'Great Sierra Nevada droughts' were somewhat distinct from the more general Great Basin/far western Plains pattern of Mediaeval aridity over the western USA.

Based on the results of a statistical analysis, it was shown that 1) the anticyclonic-warm type tended to occur in eastern Russia (55 degrees-70 degrees N, 127.5 degrees-142.5 degrees E), whereas the other three types preferentially occurred in the vicinity of Lake Baikal; 2) the two cold types generally were more common than the two warm types; and 3) the average life spans of the two anticyclonic types were longer than those of the two cyclonic types. According to a composite analysis, the four BH types were preceded by different wave train-like anomalies over the Eurasian continent over approximately one week. Correspondingly, each BH type was characterized by distinct Rossby wave propagation features. Interestingly, a northeastward propagation of the Rossby waves around the BHs was evident in the two cyclonic types. This feature differs from the quasi-meridional propagation of Rossby waves originating from suppressed convection activity over subtropical regions documented in previous studies. This study also found that every BH type was accompanied by distinct precipitation anomaly patterns over East Asia, highlighting the necessity of classifying BHs.

In terms of timing, drought occurred in the Great Lakes watershed during the 1920, 1930 and 2000 decades, and was very intense in the East during the 1930's and in the West during the 2000 decade. The main cause of extreme drought episodes in the 1920's and 1930's was a decrease in precipitation, while the 2000 decade drought is thought to be caused by increased water temperature (enhanced evaporation) due to a significant decrease in winter ice cover. The 1970 and 1980 decades were very wet over the whole watershed as a result of increased precipitation in the region. The succession of these dry and wet episodes did not have the same impacts on the stationarity of annual mean water levels in the five Great Lakes. Lake Superior shows an abrupt shift in mean in 1999, but a smoothed shift in variance since 1994, whereas Lake Erie shows four abrupt shifts in mean. Lake Ontario also shows the two first abrupt shift in mean and one abrupt change in variance. Extreme drought indices are negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for the two shallowest lakes (Ontario and Erie). In contrast, extreme wetness indices are positively correlated with PDO (positive correlation) and SOI (negative correlation) for Lake Superior only.

Relations between temperature and residential natural gas consumption in the central and eastern United States	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The increased U. S. natural gas price volatility since the mid-to-late-1980s deregulation generally is attributed to the deregulated market being more sensitive to temperature-related residential demand. This study therefore quantifies relations between winter (November-February; December-February) temperature and residential gas consumption for the United States east of the Rocky Mountains for 1989-2000, by region and on monthly and seasonal time scales. State-level monthly gas consumption data are aggregated for nine multistate subregions of three Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts of the U. S. Department of Energy. Two temperature indices [days below percentile (DBP) and heating degree-days (HDD)] are developed using the Richman-Lamb fine-resolution (similar to 1 degrees latitude-longitude) set of daily maximum and minimum temperatures for 1949-2000. Temperature parameters/values that maximize DBP/HDD correlations with gas consumption are identified. Maximum DBP and HDD correlations with gas consumption consistently are largest in the Great Lakes-Ohio Valley region on both monthly (from +0.89 to +0.91) and seasonal (from +0.93 to +0.97) time scales, for which they are based on daily maximum temperature. Such correlations are markedly lower on both time scales (from +0.62 to +0.80) in New England, where gas is less important than heating oil, and on the monthly scale ( rom +0.55 to +0.75) across the South because of low January correlations. For the South, maximum correlations are for daily DBP and HDD indices based on mean or minimum temperature. The percentiles having the highest DBP index correlations with gas consumption are slightly higher for northern regions than across the South. This is because lower (higher) relative (absolute) temperature thresholds are reached in warmer regions before home heating occurs. However, these optimum percentiles for all regions are bordered broadly by surrounding percentiles for which the correlations are almost as high as the maximum. This consistency establishes the robustness of the temperature-gas consumption relations obtained. The reference temperatures giving the highest HDD correlations with gas consumption are lower for the colder northern regions than farther south where the temperature range is truncated. However, all HDD reference temperatures greater than +10 degrees C (+15 degrees C) yield similar such correlations for northern (southern) regions, further confirming the robustness of the findings. This robustness, coupled with the very high correlation magnitudes obtained, suggests that potentially strong gas consumption predictability would follow from accurate seasonal temperature forecasts.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				NOV	2007	46	11					1993	2013		10.1175/2007JAMC1552.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2007JAMC1552.1													WOS:000251626900020
J	HURLEY, DA				HURLEY, DA			FEEDING AND TROPHIC INTERACTIONS OF WHITE PERCH (MORONE-AMERICANA) IN THE BAY OF QUINTE, LAKE-ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												White perch (Morone americana) biomass declined dramatically in the Bay of Quinte in 1978 after two abnormally cold winters in 1976-77 and 1977-78. White perch diet was qualitatively and quantitatively different before and after the population decline. Changes in production and standing stocks of diet items were related to reduced eutrophy when phosphorus inputs to the bay were restricted in early 1 978. The hypothesis that phytoplankton biomass in the shallow, highly eutrophic upper bay was related to white perch biomass through the benthic food web was not supported by the calculated daily consumption of benthos. White perch consumed about 5 % of the daily production of chironomids in 1972-77 and less than 1% in 1 978-88. In the less eutrophic, deep lower bay, predation on the amphipod Pontoporeia hoyi in August-September was 11 2 % of daily production before 1978 and affected their biomass. After 1978 when white perch biomass was reduced in the lower bay, daily consumption of P. hoyi was 1 % of daily production, and numbers of P. hoyi expanded greatly. Data linking consumption rate of specific diet items to production are necessary to establish trophic relationships and follow the effects of biomass shifts.

A clue based on morphological approach	ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The Ryukyu-ayu population on Okinawa-jima Island went extinct suddenly in the late 1970s, but the cause remains unclear. Reports say that genetic diversity was not responsible, so we investigated food shortage as a probable driver. We examined pre-extinction specimens to look for territorial individuals, which have unique morphological characteristics and occur only in food-affluent conditions. We found that 42.1% (n = 45) of individuals possessed longer dorsal fins than non-territorial fish. Combining this with another key characteristic (blackened membrane at posterior dorsal fin ray), we found that territorial fish probably constituted 35.5% which fell in the range of the expected proportion for territorial fish in the nominotypical subspecies and higher than that observed in the extant population on Amami-oshima Island. These findings imply that the food resources in the riverine environments of Okinawa-jima Island before the extinction event might be sufficient for Ryukyu-ayu to establish feeding territories. Therefore, food shortage did not cause this population extinction.

J	Liu, XK; Rao, ZG; Zhang, XJ; Huang, W; Chen, JH; Chen, FH				Liu Xiaokang; Rao Zhiguo; Zhang Xiaojian; Huang Wei; Chen Jianhui; Chen Fahu			Variations in the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation in the Tianshan Mountains region and their significance for the Westerly circulation	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Proxy records of the oxygen isotopic composition of meteorological precipitation (delta O-18(p)) preserved in archives such as ice cores, lacustrine carbonates and stalagmite calcite are important for paleoclimatic studies. Therefore, knowledge of the variations and controlling mechanisms of modern delta O-18(p) on different time scales is necessary. Here, we investigate the linear correlations between delta O-18(p) and corresponding temperature and precipitation on monthly and inter-annual timescales, using data from the Urumqi (1986-2003) and Hotan stations of the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), and delta O-18 data from 4 ice cores in the adjacent Tianshan Mountains. Consistent with previous reported results, modern delta O-18(p) variations on a seasonal time scale in the Tianshan region are mainly controlled by a 'temperature effect' (indicated by a significant positive correlation between delta O-18(p) and temperature), with more positive delta O-18(p) values occurring in summer. However, on an inter-annual timescale, there is a weak inverse correlation between weighted average annual delta O-18(p) and annual average temperature at Urumqi station. This finding is supported by the inversely varying trends of delta O-18 data from 4 ice cores in the central and eastern Tianshan Mountains compared to annual average temperatures in the same region during the past 40-50 years. The data from Urumqi station and the 4 ice cores demonstrate that there is inverse correlation between delta O-18(p) and temperature on inter-annual to decadal time scales. Analysis of water vapor sources and pathways for the warm year of 1997 and the cold year of 1988 reveal that relatively more water vapor for the Tianshan region was derived from long-distance transport from high-latitude sources than during the warm year of 1997; and that more water vapor was transported from more proximal sources from mid- to low-latitude areas during the cold year of 1988. In addition, the delta O-18(p) values are more negative in the high latitude areas than those in mid- to low-latitude areas in the Eurasian continent at the upper wind direction of Tianshan Mountains region, according to the weighted averaged warm season (May to September) delta O-18(p) values for 14 GNIP stations in the years 1997 and 1988. Due to the distribution of delta O-18(p) within the Eurasian continent, the relative shift of water vapor sources between warm and cold years convincingly explains the observed variations of delta O-18(p) in the Tianshan Mountains region. Therefore, we conclude that variations in delta O-18(p) in this region are mainly controlled by changes in water vapor sources which are ultimately caused by northward and southward shifts in the Westerly circulation.

A cost-effective and field-ready potentiostat that poises subsurface electrodes to monitor bacterial respiration	BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS												Here, we present the proof-of-concept for a subsurface bioelectrochemical system (BES)-based biosensor capable of monitoring microbial respiration that occurs through exocellular electron transfer. This system includes our open-source design of a three-channel microcontroller-unit (MCU)-based potentiostat that is capable of chronoamperometry, which laboratory tests showed to be accurate within 0.95 +/- 0.58% (95% Confidence Limit) of a commercial potentiostat. The potentiostat design is freely available online: http://angenentbee.cornel.edu/potentiostat.html. This robust and field-ready potentiostat, which can withstand temperatures of -30 degrees C, can be manufactured at relatively low cost ($600), thus, allowing for en-masse deployment at field sites. The MCU-based potentiostat was integrated with electrodes and a solar panel-based power system, and deployed as a biosensor to monitor microbial respiration in drained thaw lake basins outside Barrow, AK. At three different depths, the working electrode of a microbial three-electrode system (M3C) was maintained at potentials corresponding to the microbial reduction of iron(III) compounds and humic acids. Thereby, the working electrode mimics these compounds and is used by certain microbes as an electron acceptor. The sensors revealed daily cycles in microbial respiration. In the medium- and deep-depth electrodes the onset of these cycles followed a considerable increase in overall activity that corresponded to those soils reaching temperatures conducive to microbial activity as the summer thaw progressed. The BES biosensor is a valuable tool for studying microbial activity in situ in remote environments, and the cost-efficient design of the potentiostat allows for wide-scale use in remote areas.

J	Bastani, M; Wang, SG; Malehmir, A; Mehta, S				Bastani, Mehrdad; Wang, Shunguo; Malehmir, Alireza; Mehta, Suman			Radio-magnetotelluric and controlled-source magnetotelluric surveys on a frozen lake: Opportunities for urban applications in Nordic countries	NEAR SURFACE GEOPHYSICS												In a novel approach, we have carried out controlled-source and radio-magnetotelluric measurements in the frequency range of 2-250 kHz on a frozen lake located over a planned major multi-lane underground road tunnel near the city of Stockholm. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the resistivity variations above and, potentially, within the crystalline bedrock. Previous studies on the lake water using the boat-towed radio-magnetotelluric technique at the higher end of the frequency band lacked resolution at depth and could not provide conclusive information about bedrock level and potential fracture systems within the bedrock. Taking advantage of Nordic winters, we measured four profiles on the frozen lake complementing the previously acquired boat-towed radio-magnetotelluric data utilizing a double horizontal magnetic dipole transmitter that generated signals down to 1 kHz. The new resistivity models, incorporating the lower frequency data, show improvements and deeper penetrations based on a combined analysis of penetration depth, data misfits and sensitivity studies. The resistivity models also show better correlation with the available high-resolution shallow water seismic reflection data and the geological observations. A potential fracture system within the bedrock can also be inferred better in the new models. The idea of running similar surveys on frozen lakes can be further exploited in similar conditions in countries such as Sweden, where approximately 7% of the land is covered by freshwater bodies and poorly explored for infrastructure planning projects.

Up to 57% of the organic carbon, approximately 4% of the inorganic mercury, and nearly 71% of the methylmercury from the humic horizon of a flooded podzol were transferred to the water column and transported outside the experimental perimeter in the form of particulate matter after one resuspension event. In contrast, total dissolved mercury concentrations in the water column decreased during the resuspension event as a result of scavenging by suspended particles. We postulate that most of the methylmercury produced in the submerged soils is associated with fine-grained organic particles that remain in suspension for some time before flocculating and accumulating at the sediment-water interface. We suspect that these particles are a potential food source and can be readily ingested by pelagic and benthic detritus-feeders as well as trapped by periphyton. Resuspension and erosion processes along the exposed shores of a recently impounded reservoir may thus accelerate the transfer of mercury, primarily as methylmercury, from flooded soils to predatory fish.

The mid-and late-Holocene shoreline changes along the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland were reconstructed, using litho-, bio- and chronostratigraphical proxies from four lakes. The lakes are located within the Gulf of Finland drainage system at different altitudes between 18 and 4 m above the present sea level. The isolation from the sea and the onset of freshwater lacustrine sedimentation occurred in Tanavjarv basin at 5400 cal yr BP, in Klooga basin at 4200 cal yr BP, in Lohja basin at 2200 cal yr BP and in Kasmu basin at 1800 cal yr BP. Through the application of GIS-based analysis, a modern digital terrain model and reconstructed past water level surfaces, we present a series of scenarios of shoreline and palaeogeography changes occurring since 7800 cal yr BP. The land uplift rate, which was approximately 2.8 mm yr(-1) 7800 cal yr BP in the surroundings of Tanavjarv, has decreased to 2.2 mm yr(-1) at present and that at Lohja from 2.4 to ca 2.0 mm yr(-1), respectively. The relative sea level curves show a land uplift decrease, which is nearly linear since the mid-Holocene.					; Vassiljev, Jüri/J-2597-2018; Heinsalu, Atko/B-7080-2019; Grudzinska, Ieva/IUP-8951-2023; Vassiljev, Juri/J-2597-2018	Grudzinska-Elsberga, Ieva/0000-0003-0722-515X; Vassiljev, Juri/0000-0002-1518-2041													0367-5211	1799-4632					2013	85		1				19	34		10.17741/bgsf/85.1.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.17741/bgsf/85.1.002													WOS:000341413000003

The resulting powders were coated onto bare glass bars via physical-adhesion to obtain TAPB-DMTP-COFs coated stir bars. The self-made stir bars exhibited higher extraction efficiency (7485%) and faster dynamics (50 min) towards non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over ethylene glycol-Silicone (42-68%, 180 min) and polydimethylsiloxane (3-61%, 180 min) coated stir bars. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), zeta potential and water contact angle were employed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the adsorption mechanism between the coating and analytes. The results displayed that methoxy group worked as an adsorption site helping the adsorption of interest NSAIDs onto the TAPB-DMTP-COFs coating and hydrogen bonds formed between the O atoms and the analytes. Additionally, the adsorption mechanisms possibly also involved p-pinteraction and hydrophobic interaction. Moreover, TAPB-DMTP-COFs coated stir bars exhibited good stability and could be reused more than 60 times. Subsequently, a method by combining TAPB-DMTPCOFs coated stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) with liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet detector (UV) was established for the determination of four NSAIDs in environmental waters. Under the optimized conditions, the established method showed a wide linear range of 0.2/1-500 mu g/L for interest NSAIDs, the limits of detection varied from 0.039 to 0.312 mu g/L. Yangtze River water, East Lake water and Spring water were subjected to the proposed method, the recoveries in spiked samples were 84.7-104%, 81.2-101% and 82.6-97.6%, respectively.

Acute and chronic toxicity of neonicotinoid and butenolide insecticides to the freshwater amphipod, Hyalella azteca	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides in the world. They are preferentially toxic to insects while displaying a low toxicity toward vertebrates, and this selective toxicity has resulted in the rapid and ubiquitous use of these compounds. However, neonicotinoids have been detected in agricultural surface waters and are known to cause adverse effects in non-target aquatic organisms. A wide range of toxicity has been reported for aquatic crustaceans, but most of the studies focus on the acute effects of imidacloprid, and few data are available regarding chronic effects of other neonicotinoids or neonicotinoid replacements (e.g., butenolides). The objective of this study was to assess the acute and chronic toxicity of six neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiacloprid, and dinotefuran) and one butenolide (flupyradifurone) to the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca. Chronic (28-d), water-only, static-renewal tests were conducted. Survival was assessed weekly, and growth was measured at the end of the exposure. Effects of neonicotinoids varied depending on the compound. Acute (7-d) LC50s were 4.0, 4.7, 60, 68, 230, and 290 mu g/L for clothianidin, acetamiprid, dinotefuran, thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, respectively. Chronic (28-d) survival and growth were reduced at similar concentrations to acute (7-d) survival for thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, clothianidin, and dinotefuran. However, chronic survival and growth of amphipods exposed to imidacloprid and thiacloprid were reduced at lower concentrations than acute survival, with respective 28-d LC50s of 90 and 44 mu g/L, and EC50s of 4 and 3 mu g/L. Flupyradifurone was intermediate in toxicity compared to the neonicotinoids: 7-d LC50, 28-d LC50, and 28-d EC50 were 26, 20, and 16 mu g/L, respectively. The concentrations of imidacloprid and clothianidin reported for North American surface waters fall within the effect ranges observed in this study, indicating the potential for these compounds to cause adverse effects to indigenous populations of H. azteca.

J	Baltaci, H; da Silva, MCL; Gomes, HB				Baltaci, Hakki; Lemos da Silva, Maria Cristina; Gomes, Helber Barros			Climatological conditions of the Black Sea-effect snowfall events in Istanbul, Turkey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												A climatological analysis and overlying synoptic conditions of Black Sea-effect snowfall events were investigated for Istanbul, Turkey, during the 1971-2006 winter (DJF) periods. Using the synoptic climatological approach, the Lamb Weather Type (LWT) method was applied to NCEP/NCAR daily mean sea level pressure data. Basically, northwesterly (NW), northerly (N), and northeasterly (NE) circulation types (CTs), which blow from the Black Sea (BS), were thought to be important for sea-effect snowfall events to occur. Wind speeds and flows at 850-hPa, directional shear, and temperature difference between sea surface and 850-hPa level (SST-T-850) thresholds were applied to these three CTs in order to find suitable snowfall cases originating from the Black-Sea. The results showed that 4, 14, and 111 snowfall episodes occurred during NW, N, and NE circulation types over Istanbul with the 2.8, 4.1, and 3.5 cm daily mean snow cover depths (DMSCD), respectively. In particular, it was found that interaction between a surface high located over continental Europe and a low pressure located over the central Black Sea, and a relatively warm sea surface temperature (SST), and cold temperature anomaly at the low level of the atmosphere (SST-T-850 > 17 degrees C) are a favourable environment for the development of intense Black Sea-effect snowstorms (DMSCD > 10 cm) sourced by NE cases. A statistically significant positive relation between snow cover depths and SST-T-max (daily maximum temperature) under NE cases (r = 0.28, p < .05) indicated that we observe intense daily snow accumulation when land-sea temperature contrast increases (>7 degrees C) in the region.

An unusual cyanobacterium from saline thermal waters with relatives from unexpected habitats	EXTREMOPHILES												Cyanobacteria that grow above seawater salinity at temperatures above 45A degrees C have rarely been studied. Cyanobacteria of this type of thermo-halophilic extremophile were isolated from siliceous crusts at 40-45A degrees C in a geothermal seawater lagoon in southwest Iceland. Iceland Clone 2e, a Leptolyngbya morphotype, was selected for further study. This culture grew only at 45-50A degrees C, in medium ranging from 28 to 94 g L-1 TDS, It showed 3 doublings 24 h(-1) under continuous illumination. This rate at 54A degrees C was somewhat reduced, and death occurred at 58A degrees C. A comparison of the 16S rDNA sequence with all others in the NCBI database revealed 2 related Leptolyngbya isolates from a Greenland hot spring (13-16 g L-1 TDS). Three other similar sequences were from Leptolyngbya isolates from dry, endolithic habitats in Yellowstone National Park. All 6 formed a phylogenetic clade, suggesting common ancestry. These strains shared many similarities to Iceland Clone 2e with respect to temperature and salinity ranges and optima. Two endolithic Leptolyngbya isolates, grown previously at 23A degrees C in freshwater medium, grew well at 50A degrees C but only in saline medium. This study shows that limited genotypic similarity may reveal some salient phenotypic similarities, even when the related cyanobacteria are from vastly different and remote habitats.																			1431-0651	1433-4909				JUL	2009	13	4					707	716		10.1007/s00792-009-0258-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-009-0258-y								19543949					WOS:000267781200013

However, few records are available with sufficient temporal length and resolution, which enable the two signals to be separated, and hence address the dynamics of haze days and the global impact of the anthropogenic emissions in China, particularly in the context of global warming. Here we present the first long-term (last 180 years) lake sediment records of changes in wind strength and atmospheric loading of anthropogenic emissions in China. Our results show that the atmospheric loading of anthropogenic emissions and haze formation are closely related to the changes in wind strength associated with temperature changes, which are likely forced by tropical sea surface temperature. Comparison of our results with Pb isotope records from Japan and with the record of Pb concentrations in Greenland ice core indicates that the anthropogenic pollutants emitted in China stagnate mainly over the source area and neighboring regions, which thus favors haze formation under a warming climate. However, they would be transported worldwide under conditions of strong winds and decreased temperature. Climatic warming, together with the periodic changes in temperature, has caused unprecedented heavy haze days in recent decades in China. The observed pattern of periodic temperature variations suggests that in the next 30 years, wind strength will increase and thus reduce the incidence of haze days. However, this reduction may be attenuated by continued climatic warming as anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions continue.					; Jiang, Dabang/I-2243-2014; hao, qing zhen/E-4605-2010; Wang, Luo/A-1430-2009; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012; Hao, Qingzhen/KCK-8974-2024	xu, bing/0000-0003-1323-938X; hao, qing zhen/0000-0002-6281-5817; Wang, Luo/0000-0003-2217-8478; Chu, Guoqiang/0000-0001-8256-3947; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 27	2019	124	12					6180	6190		10.1029/2018JD030119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JD030119													WOS:000477800000016

Still today, even a good number of settlements relating to Lake Beysehir stand. However, lives of many people who have existed by the coast of Lake Beysehir since pre-historic times depend heavily on the rising and falling of the lake waters. Despite the flood disasters which had happened many times before, there was a great flood in 1910-1911. The reason for this disaster was some activities in the Konya Plain Irrigation Project. Because of the floods having happened for two years, about 30 villages in Beysehir, Seydisehir and Bozkir, and 25-30000 acres of farmland in some other villages in Konya Plain were flooded. That case caused various environmental problems in the region. Due to erroneous watering policies adopted after the Konya Plain Irrigation Project which is the first serious intervention to nature regime of Lake Beysehir, the lake waters receded, and particularly since 1990, Lake Beysehir has begun to face the danger of getting dry.																			1300-5766						2008		23					219	262																WOS:000421793300010
J	Fisher, TG; Smith, DG; Andrews, JT				Fisher, TG; Smith, DG; Andrews, JT			Preboreal oscillation caused by a glacial Lake Agassiz flood	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Preboreal oscillation (PBO) has been attributed to increased meltwater, but the source of the meltwater and causative mechanism of the PBO has remained elusive. Here we attribute the source to a massive meltwater discharge event from an abrupt drainage of glacial Lake Agassiz, Canada, via the Mackenzie River into the Arctic Ocean. A maximum volume of 2 1,000 km(3) was discharged over a 1.5-3 yr period with a peak discharge of 0.500 Sverdrups (Sv), equivalent to a 6 in rise in the Arctic Ocean (or 0.062 m rise in global sea level). The flood occurred at about 11,335 cal yr BP, and was followed by a similar to0.042Sv flow until 10,750 cal yr BP when the southern outlet of Lake Agassiz reopened and diverted drainage to the Mississippi River system. We estimate that only 2-4% of the flood water would have frozen into sea ice within the Beaufort region, but coupled with increased river ice production during winter, and thicker pack ice growth throughout the Arctic Ocean, a thicker, longer lasting and more extensive pack ice may have been flushed through Fram Strait. The thicker and more extensive pack ice, and freshened sea surface, may have triggered the PBO by increasing albedo, and generating a low salinity anomaly upon melting in the North Atlantic, thus decreasing the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water.

Landslides in lakes are smaller in size and more readily accessible and therefore represent a good alternative to their marine counterparts. Lake Villarrica, located in South-Central Chile, experienced significant slope failure and serves here as an exemplary study area for subaqueous landslide initiation mechanisms in tectonically active settings. Coring and CPTU testing were undertaken with the MARUM free-fall CPTU deployed adjacent to the coring sites where all lithological units involved in the slope failure were sampled. Using geotechnical methods such as pseudo-static factor of safety analysis and cyclic triaxial testing, three types of soils (i.e., diatomaceous ooze, volcanic ash, and quick clay) were analyzed for their role in slope failure, and earthquake shaking was identified as the primary trigger mechanism. The investigated landslide consisted of two distinct phases. During the first phase, slope failure was initiated above a tephra layer. In the second phase, retrogression led to the shoreward extension of the slide scarp along a second failure plane located in a stratigraphically deeper, extremely sensitive lithology (i.e., quick clay). Results show that liquefaction of buried tephra layers was unlikely, but such layers might still have contributed to a reduction in shear strength along the contact area with the neighboring sediment. Furthermore, cyclic shaking-induced pore pressure in diatomaceous ooze may be similar to that in granular soils. We generally infer that failure mechanisms observed in this study are equally important for landslide initiation in submarine settings as diatomaceous ooze intercalated with volcanic ash may be abundantly present along active continental margins.

J	Otvos, EG				Otvos, EG			Holocene aridity and storm phases, Gulf and Atlantic coasts, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A bottomland flora that prevailed between ∼ 9900 and 6000 cal yr B.P. in a North Carolina stream valley may not reflect a regionally much wetter Atlantic climate, coeval with record drought in the Great Plains region and assumed dry Gulf coastal conditions. Such conditions were inferred for 6000 ± 1000 yr ago when the Bermuda High may have consistently occupied summer positions far to the NE. Arid episodes coeval with the Little River local wet interval are known from eolian sediments and pollen spectra in the Atlantic and the Gulf coastal plain. For multiple reasons, the regional extent, intensity, and duration of coastal aridity and alternating wet phases and the Bermuda High positions are not yet adequately constrained. The climate and edaphic causes for the steadily growing predominance of southern pines over hardwoods, achieved between ∼ 8900 and 4200 cal yr B.P. at different sites at different times are similarly still unresolved.

Holocene tephrochronology of the lower Rio Cisnes valley, southern Chile	ANDEAN GEOLOGY												Sediment cores from lakes and bogs in the Rio Cisnes valley contain tephra from explosive eruptions of volcanoes in the southern part of the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone (SSVZ). These tephra, which thicken and coarsen to the west, are attributed to eruptions from Melimoyu, Mentolat, Hudson, and potentially either Maca, Cay or one of the many minor eruptive centers (MEC) located both along the Liquine-Ofqui Fault Zone (LOFZ) and surrounding the major volcanoes. Correlation of the tephra between two new cores in the lower Rio Cisnes valley, and amongst other cores previously described from the region, and source volcano identification for the tephra, has been done using lithostratigraphic data (tephra layer thickness and grain size), petrography (tephra glass color, vesicle morphology, and type and abundance of phenocryst phases), and by comparison of bulk tephra trace-element characteristics with previously published whole-rock and bulk tephra chemical analysis. Four tephras in these cores are attributed to eruptions of Mentolat, four to eruptions from Melimoyu, one possibly to Hudson, and six cannot be assigned to a specific source volcano. Some of these tephra correspond to pyroclastic tephra fall deposits previously observed in outcrop, including the MEL2 eruption of Melimoyu and the MEN1 eruption of Mentolat. However, others have not been previously observed and represent the products of newly identified small to medium sized eruptions from volcanoes of the SSVZ. These results provide new information concerning the frequency and magnitude of explosive eruption of SSVZ volcanoes and contribute to the evaluation of volcanic hazards in the region.

On a calm clear day a mixing layer of about 1500 m height was generated by the thermally induced circulation over the basin. The maximum air temperature in the urban area was recorded at around 18 : 00 LST, even though the area is only a few kilometers in extent and consists of low buildings and low anthropogenic heat release, Numerical analysis was conducted, to evaluate the daytime heating process and urban effects, using a three-dimensional k-epsilon model. The 100 x 120 km computational domain was discretized horizontally using a nested grid system consisting of three overlapping grids. The results were in good agreement with the observed values of air temperature, mixing ratio, and wind profiles, The large circulations experienced in this region were predicted with the downward wind over the lake bringing a warm and dry air mass to the ground. The air temperature in the urban area rose and maintained its high value until late afternoon, mainly due to the local circulation adding to the urban effects. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Extensive aeolian sediments in the basin represent important archives of regional environmental evolution. However, the paleosol development timing is still not clear because of limited number of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) sampling and dating, which restricts our understanding of past aeolian activities during the Holocene in GHB. In this study, a loess-paleosol section, Najiao (NJ), from the southeastern margin of GHB was investigated. Eighteen OSL samples were obtained from the 400-cm section in order to construct a high-resolution chronological framework. Paleoenvironmental proxies including grain size distribution (GS), magnetic susceptibility (MS), total organic carbon (TOC), and geochemical elements were measured to reconstruct the Holocene aeolian activity. Results show a successive accumulation from Early to Middle Holocene at NJ section, but a c. 3 ka sedimentary hiatus is found between c. 5 and 1.5 ka. Paleosol ages are constrained by high-resolution OSL ages which are from c. 7-5 ka. Consistent with previous studies, strong aeolian activities occurred in GHB during the Early Holocene (c. 13-9 ka), indicating dry climate conditions. Initiation of pedogenesis was at c. 9 ka, and the intensified soil development and lowest aeolian activity were between c. 7 and 5 ka. The increased sand content after c. 1.5 ka indicates enhanced human activities in the interior of GHB in the Late Holocene.

However, flood events and human activities may make the seismic signal unrecognizable. In this study, high-resolution analyses of sedimentary structure, physical and chemical proxies, as well as absolutely radioactive dating were conducted on seven representative sediment cores from the depocenter, nearshore and inlet areas of Yangzong Lake, a typical fault lake in the Xiaojiang Fault zone, southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). These new data were calibrated by historical documents, suggesting that seismically induced mass-transport deposits (MTDs, i.e., turbidites) were massive and/or amalgamated (earthquake doublet), became fining and thickening towards the lake center (without changing lake morphology), and occasionally exhibited soft sediment deformation structures (SSDs, i.e., microfaults). These sediments were relatively poorly sorted and instantaneously deposited from slope failures within the lake. An extremely strong earthquake could cause coseismic subsidence of the lake basin and destruct the local hydrological system, resulting in exceptionally high Mn and total inorganic carbon (TIC) contents in the lake center. In contrast, flood deposits were thinner with horizontal beddings, had higher terrestrial organic matter (higher C/N ratios), and distributed locally in the lake inlet area. Human activities-induced sediments were inversely graded, poorly sorted and gradually deposited, had horizontal beddings and no erosive base, and exhibited high carbon, Pb and Zn contents and low C/N ratios.

Trace elements baseline levels in Usnea antarctica from Clearwater Mesa, James Ross Island, Antarctica	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Clearwater Mesa is a pristine area located SE of Croft Bay in James Ross Island, at the northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula. The closest anthropic construction is the summer Mendel station located 25 km to the NE. Clearwater is a remote basalt volcanic mesa, (64 degrees 01 ' S, 57 degrees 42 ' W) located at similar to 250 m a.s.l., with around 50 small shallow lakes, a well-developed lichens flora and scarce fauna. The mesa offers a good opportunity to use lichens, like Usnea antarctica, as a biomonitor species. The aim of this study was to determine the baseline levels of trace elements in Usnea antarctica and their relationships with geographical parameters and climatological aspects, to use them as reference levels in futures studies. Usnea antarctica was collected in 23 sites in two transects: perpendicular and parallel to the shore. We found high contents of the elements associated with long-distance transport like Sm, La, Sc, Fe, Co, Hg, and Ca. The elements linked to the marine biogenic cycle as Sr, Rb, Cs, K, Na, Sb, As, Se, and Br were less significant. The distance to the sea was the factor that related the element contents. Hg, Se, As, and Br content in Usnea antarctica increased from the inland towards the sea coast.

Landscape Erosion, Karstic Activity and the Development of a Wetland in the Southern Bekaa Valley, Lebanon During the Last Glacial Period	WETLANDS												We present the results of the first multi-proxy sedimentological analysis of a sedimentary sequence recovered from Aammiq Wetland in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon that spans the very end of the last interglacial and the last glacial period (similar to 112 to similar to 35 ka BP). We show that the high authigenic carbonate content of the sediment that accumulated at the end of the last interglacial and the start of the last glacial period similar to 112 to similar to 86 ka BP was due to the significant influx of Ca enriched spring water. The concurrent low abundances of Si, Al and Ti probably reflect low levels of erosion in the watershed that was covered by arboreal vegetation. A shift in the hydrological system occurred around similar to 86 ka BP, which resulted in a lowering of water levels and the development of anoxic conditions, enabled the accumulation of organic matter. A transition from organic rich sediment to silty clay, coupled with an increase in Si, Al and Ti at similar to 63 ka BP records a reduction in organic productivity in the wetland and an increase in weathering and erosion in the watershed.

J	Moro, D; Bradshaw, SD				Moro, D; Bradshaw, SD			Diets and predictions of feeding rate of house mice and Lakeland Downs short-tailed mice inhabiting an arid-zone island in Western Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												An analysis of the faecal pellets of two species of arid-zone mouse, the house mouse (Mus domesticus) and Lakeland Downs short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis), inhabiting Thevenard Island in Western Australia was conducted to ascertain their dietary requirements, and to use this information to predict their feeding rates in the field. Both species consumed seed, monocotyledon and dicotyledon plant material and invertebrate material, although the relative frequency-of-occurrence of these items varied throughout the year. Invertebrate material formed the highest proportion of dietary intake for both rodent species at all times, suggesting that this dietary strategy is advantageous for rodent species that inhabit environments where plant seeding is seasonal and rainfall dependent. The dry-matter intake (DMI) of free-ranging M. domesticus and L. lakedownensis was predicted and compared using information from two sources: their isotopic water fluxes and the water content of their diet, and their isotopic sodium fluxes and the sodium content of their diet with and without corrections for non-dietary (exogenous) sources of sodium. The DMI derived from the water turnover was high for both species, suggesting that the mice were drinking and that assumptions inherent in this calculation were violated. Feeding rates were also high if no correction was made for exogenous, non-dietary sodium. When corrections were made, however, M. domesticus was predicted to ingest 4.62 +/- 0.20 g dry matter day(-1) compared with 3.86 +/- 0.23 g dry matter day(-1) for L. lakedownensis. When DMI was scaled on the basis of allometric predictions for desert eutherians, only estimates of DMI for M. domesticus fell outside the predicted 95% confidence intervals. The results presented suggest that M. domesticus were obtaining some sodium from sources additional to their diet. Taken together, this methodology provides a useful application for measuring the feeding rate of free-ranging species given known dietary requirements in the field.

In the years leading up to this ban, air concentrations of gamma-HCH, the active ingredient of lindane, decreased gradually over the Great Lakes region. Typical mean concentrations were about 5 and 10 pg m(-3) for Lakes Huron and Ontario, respectively, during the summer of 2005. However, during the period June 27-28, 2005, a gamma-HCH air pollution episode was captured in Toronto by three independent sampling programs [Episodic Pesticide Transport (EPT) Study, Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) and Canadian Atmospheric Network for Currently Used Pesticides (CANCUP)], with concentrations of 586 and 3 070 pg m(-3) measured in north and downtown Toronto, respectively - an increase of about two orders of magnitude above typical levels. This episode was not observed at any of the regional IADN sites on the same day, suggesting a localized emission in the city from an unknown and episodic source. This study demonstrates the value in continued monitoring of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) beyond their phase-out period and highlights the importance of combining information from different projects to discover environmental pollution events.

Evaluation of acoustic transmitter implantation and determination of post-translocation behaviour of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in a South African impoundment	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides are an important angling species that are often displaced during catch-and-release fishing tournaments. The impact of acoustic transmitter implantation on this species and the effect of displacement distance on their behaviour were tested. In April 2010, 10 fish with surgically implanted dummy acoustic transmitters and 10 control individuals were kept for 20 weeks under laboratory conditions. Wound healing, hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index and viscerosomatic index did not differ between treatment and control groups. However, fish with implanted dummy transmitters lost weight more rapidly than control fish. In 2010, an array of passive data-logging receivers was used at Wriggleswade Dam, Eastern Cape, to record movements of 10 acoustically tagged bass that had been displaced for distances ranging from 0.1 to 4.3 km. Fish displaced by up to 3.5 km remained within 3-4 km of their release site, but fish displaced 4.3 km immediately returned to their capture locations. Seven weeks after the initiation of the experiment, with the onset of winter, fish that had been holding in the vicinity of their release site near the Kubusi River inlet moved into the deeper basin of the impoundment. The results suggest that largemouth bass displaced for up to 4.3 km during fishing tournaments return to their capture localities.

The formed lake with a strong stratification had a final volume of 2 x 10(6) m(3). Its water was highly toxic and of dark brownish color (transparency about 3 cm). Traditional remediation methods were too expensive, and it was therefore necessary to develop a new, ecologically and economically acceptable remediation strategy. This strategy is based on a first precipitation step of the dark-brown-colored macromolecules as iron-humate floes at pH 4.0. These macromolecules are similar to fulvic/humic acid and are formed abiotically by autoxidation of polyphenolic compounds. Thus, the dissolved organic matter (DOM, about 280 mg/l) was decreased by about 50 % and transparency improved. After a neutralization step with 2200 m(3) of 20 % calcium carbonate suspension and a subsequent "fertilization" with 0.75 % phosphoric acid Q x 0.8 m(3)) "enhanced natural attenuation" was initiated. Due to higher transparency, intense growth of algae ("blooming") and bacteria started in the upper zone of the lake. In winter, algae sedimented and one year after the precipitation step, the water of the surface zone was almost clear (transparency 1 m after 10 years over 3 m) and odorless.																			0033-4545	1365-3075				JAN	2010	82	1					161	173		10.1351/PAC-CON-09-05-05	http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/PAC-CON-09-05-05													WOS:000274709300015

INFLUENCE OF ICE THICKNESS ON SMOS AND AQUARIUS BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES OVER ANTARCTICA	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				The Dome-C region, in the East Antarctic Plateau, has been used for calibration/validation of satellite microwave radiometers since the 1970's. However, its use as an independent external target has been recently questioned due to some spatial inhomogeneities found in L-band airborne and satellite observations. This work evidences the influence of the Antarctic ice thickness spatial variations on the measured SMOS and Aquarius brightness temperatures (T-B). The possible effects of subglacial water and bedrock on the acquired radiometric signals have also been analyzed. A 3-months no-daylight period during the Austral winter has been selected. Four transects over East Antarctica have been defined to study the spatial variations. A good agreement between SMOS and Aquarius T-B changes and ice thickness variations over the whole Antarctica has been observed, obtaining linear correlations of 0.6-0.7 and slopes of 8.6-9.5 K/km. The subglacial lakes may affect the vertical physical temperature profile and/or the dielectric properties of the ice layers above. As expected, the subglacial bedrock is not contributing to the measured T-B, since the maximum estimated L-band penetration depth is similar to 1-1.5 km.

Molecular and phenetic characterization of the bacterial assemblage of Hot Lake, WA, an environment with high concentrations of magnesium sulphate, and its relevance to Mars	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY												Hot Lake (Oroville, WA) is an athalassohaline epsomite lake that can have precipitating concentrations of MgSO4 salts, mainly epsomite. Little biotic study has been done on epsomite lakes and it was unclear whether microbes isolated from epsomite lakes and their margins would fall within recognized halotolerant genera, common soil genera or novel phyla. Our initial study cultivated and characterized epsotolerant bacteria from the lake and its margins. Approximately 100 aerobic heterotrophic microbial isolates were obtained by repetitive streak-plating in high-salt media including either 10% NaCl or 2M MgSO4. The collected isolates were all bacteria, nearly evenly divided between Gram-positive and Gram-negative clades, the most abundant genera being Halomonas, Idiomarina, Marinobacter, Marinococcus, Nesterenkonia, Nocardiopsis and Planococcus. Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Exiguobacterium, Kocuria and Staphylococcus also were cultured. This initial study included culture-independent community analysis of direct DNA extracts of lake margin soil using PCR-based clone libraries and 16S rRNA gene phylogeny. Clones assigned to Gram-positive bacterial clades (70% of total clones) were dominated by sequences related to uncultured actinobacteria. There were abundant Deltaproteobacteria clones related to bacterial sulphur metabolisms and clones of Legionella and Coxiella. These epsomite lake microbial communities seem to be divided between bacteria primarily associated with hyperhaline environments rich in NaCl and salinotolerant relatives of common soil organisms. Archaea appear to be in low abundance and none were isolated, despite near-saturated salinities. Growth of microbes at very high concentrations of magnesium and other sulphates has relevance to planetary protection and life-detection missions to Mars, where scant liquid water may form as deliquescent brines and appear as eutectic liquids.																			1473-5504	1475-3006				JAN	2014	13	1					69	80		10.1017/S1473550413000268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1473550413000268								24748851					WOS:000332309400008

The Lake Ontario Nearshore Study: Introduction and summary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Intensive sampling of seven 100-km(2) nearshore sites and a lake circumnavigation using geo-spatially linked, continuous-measuring sensors allowed unprecedented detail on the structure of the nearshore of Lake Ontario in the post-dreissenid era. The 23 manuscripts describe the wide variability in nearshore nutrients, suspended solids, and organic wastewater correlated with proximity to the shoreline and among geographic areas. Although 7.71 x 10(5) mT of dreissenids exist in the nearshore, phosphorus regenerated was not enough to sustain populations of Cladophora. The phosphorus load of tributaries to Lake Ontario was 234% higher than of wastewater treatment plants and 67.5% of the 1982 Niagara phosphorus load. Phosphorus loading from local watersheds appeared to be the underlying driver for the spatial nearshore variability in Cladophora biomass. Such research has implications for the nearshore of other large lakes and is a necessary prerequisite to more fully understand how the nearshore functions in the post-dreissenid era. Consistent monitoring should be conducted on the major tributaries and representative smaller water courses in Ontario and New York to obtain ongoing information on the spectrum of influences that shoreline runoff has on the nearshore and the lake as a whole. We believe, however, that this falls short of what is needed to effectively manage nearshore water resources. We suggest that nearshore management might be advanced by a more purposeful coupling of the knowledge that exists in the field of watershed science with that of the limnology of large lakes to predict explicit nearshore conditions in the face of potential future environmental management regimes.

The result showed that PAHs could be found in all the samples, and the average residue of PAHs was 4114.2 ng/g. The coefficient of variation was 0.98, which indicated a greater dispersion. The pollution was more serious in the specified district than other domestic and foreign area. The ratio of specific PAHs demonstrated that they mainly came from combustion process and then fall to the surface by means of atmospheric deposition, thus, the departments concerned should strengthen or improve the use of fuel.					hu, lisong/AAO-6592-2021; He, Guanghui/B-9830-2014; liu, xiwen/GSJ-3861-2022														1022-6680		978-3-03785-188-3				2011	281						280	285		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.281.280	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.281.280													WOS:000303347800059

WORKING IN HARMONY	INTERNATIONAL EROSION CONTROL ASSOCIATION - PROCEEDINGS OF CONFERENCE				International-Erosion-Control-Association Conference 28	FEB 25-28, 1997	NASHVILLE, TN	Hydro Blanket, N Amer Green, Amer Excelsior Co, Earth Sci Div				The Cabin Branch watershed in western Henrico County, Virginia, lies in a predominately urban area that is west of the fall line dividing the Atlantic Coastal Plain in the east and the Piedmont Plateau in the west. The County is in the rapidly urbanizing Richmond metropolitan area and this urbanizing process has stressed many small tributaries of the watershed. Conditions in the project stream reach have deposited a heavy load of sediment downstream into a shallow lake. This headwaters drainage area was ''built out'' prior to development of Virginia erosion control laws and the adoption of Chesapeake Bay regulations. An environmental partnership has been developed to stabilize Cabin Branch creek and control the erosive forces of stormwater. The early analysis detailed a mirage of problems that collectively have resulted in a highly unstable stream. Components of the restoration analysis include a detailed stream survey, hydrologic modeling using HEC-RAS and use of the Rosgen stream classification system. The strength of the project lies in the close working relationship of the public/private partnership involved. Each entity brings an expertise that provides a synergistic effect and enhances the success of the stabilization project.																			1092-2806						1997	28						187	194																WOS:A1997BH75C00018
J	WEBB, DW				WEBB, DW			LIMNOLOGICAL FEATURES OF CEDAR LAKE MANITOBA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Cedar Lake, largest lake in the Saskatchewan River system, was studied from June 14 until. August 31, 1962. Twenty stations, located in the main basin of the lake, were examined during six sampling periods. These stations were located along five transects, at depths of 1.5, 3, 6, and 9 m. No thermal stratification occurred and the oxygen concentration never fell below 78% of air saturation. Total alkalinity and total dissolved solids averaged above 65 and 270 ppm, respectively. The average number of bottom organisms increased with depth, with the bulk of these being made up of sphaeriid clams, mayflies, chironomids, and gastropods. The number of genera also increased with depth. The standing crops determined for the six sampling periods ranged from 17.7 to 33.2 lb/acre (dry weight), with a mean value of 23.4 lb/acre. Correlations between the physical and chemical factors and the distribution of bottom fauna are examined and it is felt that the bottom type is the major factor affecting the distribution and abundance of bottom organisms in Cedar Lake. On the basis of the physical and chemical criteria. Cedar Lake may be classified as eutrophic.																									1965	22	5					1123	+		10.1139/f65-101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f65-101													WOS:A19656999900002

Recent ground thermo-hydrological changes in a southern Tibetan endorheic catchment and implications for lake level changes	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Climate change modifies the water and energy fluxes between the atmosphere and the surface in mountainous regions such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which has shown substantial hydrological changes over the last decades, including rapid lake level variations. The ground across the QTP hosts either permafrost or is seasonally frozen, and, in this environment, the ground thermal regime influences liquid water availability, evaporation and runoff. Consequently, climate-induced changes in the ground thermal regime may contribute to variations in lake levels, but the validity of this hypothesis has yet to be established.This study focuses on the cryo-hydrology of the catchment of Lake Paiku (southern Tibet) for the 1980-2019 period. We process ERA5 data with downscaling and clustering tools (TopoSCALE, TopoSUB) to account for the spatial variability of the climate in our forcing data (Fiddes and Gruber, 2012, 2014). We use a distributed setup of the CryoGrid community model (version 1.0) to quantify thermo-hydrological changes in the ground during this period. Forcing data and simulation outputs are validated with data from a weather station, surface temperature loggers and observations of lake level variations. Our lake budget reconstruction shows that the main water input to the lake is direct precipitation (310 mm yr - 1 ), followed by glacier runoff (280 mm yr - 1 ) and land runoff (180 mm yr - 1 ). However, altogether these components do not offset evaporation (860 mm yr - 1 ).Our results show that both seasonal frozen ground and permafrost have warmed (0.17 circle C per decade 2 m deep), increasing the availability of liquid water in the ground and the duration of seasonal thaw. Correlations with annual values suggest that both phenomena promote evaporation and runoff. Yet, ground warming drives a strong increase in subsurface runoff so that the runoff / (evaporation + runoff) ratio increases over time. This increase likely contributed to stabilizing the lake level decrease after 2010.Summer evaporation is an important energy sink, and we find active-layer deepening only where evaporation is limited. The presence of permafrost is found to promote evaporation at the expense of runoff, consistently with recent studies suggesting that a shallow active layer maintains higher water contents close to the surface. However, this relationship seems to be climate dependent, and we show that a colder and wetter climate produces the opposite effect. Although the present study was performed at the catchment scale, we suggest that this ambivalent influence of permafrost may help to understand the contrasting lake level variations observed between the south and north of the QTP, opening new perspectives for future investigations.					; Martin, Leo/V-5865-2019; Westermann, Sebastian/I-2976-2012; Immerzeel, Walter/E-2489-2012; Langer, Moritz/KWU-0937-2024	Martin, Leo/0000-0001-5405-0175; Mathys, Tamara/0009-0007-8957-851X; Kraaijenbrink, Philip/0000-0002-0126-8602; Magni, Michele/0000-0002-6184-4413; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				DEC 14	2023	27	24					4409	4436		10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023													WOS:001168851900001

The Effect of Sample Size on the Stability of Principal Components Analysis of Truss-Based Fish Morphometrics	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Multivariate analysis of fish morphometric truss elements for stock identification, description of new species, assessment of condition, and other applications is frequently conducted on data sets that have sample sizes smaller than those recommended in the literature. Minimum Sample size recommendations are rarely accompanied by empirical support, and we know of no previous assessment of minimum sample sizes for multivariate analysis of fish truss elements. We examined the stability of outcomes of principal components analysis (PCA) Of truss elements, a commonly applied method of morphometric analysis for. fishes. by conducting PCA on 1,000 resamples for each of 24 different Sample sizes (N: each sample drawn Without replacement) from collections of Yellow perch Perca flavescens (397 fish), while perch Morone americana (208 fish). and siscowet fake trout Salvelinus namaycush (560 fish). Eigenvalues were inflated and loadings on eigenvectors were highly unstable for the first three principal components (PCs) whenever N was smaller than the number of truss elements (P). Stability of eigenvalues and eigenvectors increased as the N:P ratio increased for all three Species. but the N:P ratio at which stable results were achieved varied by species, Our results suggest that an N:P ratio of 3.5-8.0 was required for stability of PC2 and PC3. which is required for analysis of fish Shape. Because some of our results varied among the species we examined. we recommend similar evaluations for other species. Results from past work that used PCA of truss elements and where N was less than P may require re-evaluation.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2009	138	3					487	496		10.1577/T08-091.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T08-091.1													WOS:000268501100004
J	Bradford, DF; Jaeger, JR; Jennings, RD				Bradford, DF; Jaeger, JR; Jennings, RD			Population status and distribution of a decimated amphibian, the relict leopard frog (Rana onca)	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												The relict leopard frog (Rana onca) was once thought to be extinct, but has recently been shown to comprise a valid taxon with 'extant populations. We delineate the minimum historical range of the species based on records from 24 localities, report the extinction of 2 of 7 populations extant in the 1990s, and estimate total population size. The 5 remaining Populations Occurred in 2 areas: near the Overton Arm of Lake Mead and in Black Canyon along the Colorado River below Lake Mead, Nevada. These 2 areas are only 3.6 and 5.1 km long, respectively. The 5 extant populations inhabited spring systems with largely unaltered hydrology and no introduced American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) or game fishes. In a mark-recapture study conducted in the Overton Arm area, the estimated number of adult frogs averaged 36 over 555 m of stream habitat, and estimated annual survivorship of adults averaged 0.27. A single mark-recapture estimate for the size of the largest population within Black Canyon, at a site approximately 450 m in length, was 637 adult frogs. An estimate for the total number of frogs at all sites, based on mark-recapture data, Visual encounter surveys, and extent of habitat, was approximately 1,100 adults (range 6931,833). The 2 recent population extinctions occurred concomitantly with encroachment of emergent vegetation into pools. We speculate that this occurred as a result of natural processes in one case, and anthropogenic processes in the other.																			0038-4909					JUN	2004	49	2					218	228		10.1894/0038-4909(2004)049<0218:PSADOA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2004)049<0218:PSADOA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222148800006

THE GENESIS OF THE THERMAL LAKE LOCATED WITHIN THE COASTAL AREA OF ITURUP ISLAND (THE KURILS)	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												The 3D model of tectonic fragmentation of the block of rock for the central part of Iturup Island has been developed to clarify the permeable zones of the upper part of the Earth's crust. The use of the thermal infrared cameras allows us to image the bottom of Lake Utinaya Banya. The differential-leveling survey data helped us to develop the 3D model of the relief of the lake basin and the adjacent areas. We made chemical analyzes of waters and free gases released from the bottom of Lake Utinaya Banya. We revealed mineral composition of sediments collected during drilling in the area of the explosive event on the lake. Also we presented the conceptual model of the hydrothermal-magmatic system of the studied area. Thus, the obtained data suggest that Lake Utinaya Banya, located in the central part of Iturup Island may have been formed as the result of a series of hydrothermal eruptions. So, we can conclude that there is a risk of new hydrothermal explosions at Lake Utinaya Banya in the future.

J	Lucic, G; Stix, J; Wing, B				Lucic, Gregor; Stix, John; Wing, Boswell			Structural controls on the emission of magmatic carbon dioxide gas, Long Valley Caldera, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												We present a degassing study of Long Valley Caldera that explores the structural controls upon emissions of magmatic carbon dioxide gas. A total of 223 soil gas samples were collected and analyzed for stable carbon isotopes using a field-portable cavity ring-down spectrometer. This novel technique is flexible, accurate, and provides sampling feedback on a daily basis. Sampling sites included major and minor volcanic centers, regional throughgoing faults, caldera-related structures, zones of elevated seismicity, and zones of past and present hydrothermal activity. The classification of soil gases based on their C-13 and CO2 values reveals a mixing relationship among three end-members: atmospheric, biogenic, and magmatic. Signatures dominated by biogenic contributions (similar to 4 vol %, -24) are found on the caldera floor, the interior of the resurgent dome, and areas associated with the Hilton Creek and Hartley Springs fault systems. With the introduction of the magmatic component (similar to 100vol %, -4.5), samples acquire mixing and hydrothermal signatures and are spatially associated with the central caldera and Mammoth Mountain. In particular, they are concentrated along the southern margin of the resurgent dome where the interplay between resurgence-related reverse faulting and a bend in the regional fault system has created a highly permeable fracture network, suitable for the formation of shallow hydrothermal systems. This contrasts with the south moat, where despite elevated seismicity, a thick sedimentary cover has formed an impermeable cap, inhibiting the ascent of fluids and gases to the surface.

The study of phytoplankton in large lakes is a challenging task which requires the use of a wide variety of techniques to capture the range of spatial and temporal variations. The analysis of marker pigments may provide an adequate tool for phytoplankton surveys in large water bodies, thanks to automated analysis for processing numerous individual samples, and by achieving sufficient taxonomic resolution for ecological studies. Chlorophylls and carotenoids were analysed by HPLC in water column samples of Lake Tanganyika from 2002 through 2006, at two study sites, off Kigoma (north basin) and off Mpulungu (south basin). Using the CHEMTAX software for calculating contributions of the main algal groups to chlorophyll a, variations of phytoplankton composition and biomass were determined. We also investigated selected samples according to standard taxonomic techniques for elucidating the dominant species composition. Most of the phytoplankton biomass was located in the 0-40 m layer, with maxima at 0 or 20 m, and more rarely at 40 m. Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) and surface 'blooms' were occasionally observed. The phytoplankton assemblage was essentially dominated by chlorophytes and cyanobacteria, with diatoms developing mainly in the dry season. The dominant cyanobacteria were very small unicells (mostly Synechococcus), which were much more abundant in the southern basin, whereas green algae dominated on average at the northern site. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) including the main limnological variables, dissolved nutrients and zooplankton abundance was run to explore environment-phytoplankton relations. The CCA points to physical factors, site and season as key determinants of the phytoplankton assemblage, but also indicates a significant role, depending on the studied site, of calanoid copepods and of nauplii stages. Our data suggest that the factors allowing coexistence of several phytoplankton taxa in the pelagic zone of Lake Tanganyika are likely differential vertical distribution in the water column, which allows spatial partitioning of light and nutrients, and temporal variability (occurring at time scales preventing long-term dominance by a single taxon), along with effects of predation by grazers.

Neither the presence of catfish nor inoculation with salmonellae had detectable effects on the abundance of the microbial community. Densities of the microbial community were about 10(5) cells/mL in the water during a 1-week period, whereas densities of the microbial community increased 10-fold (10(6) to 10(7) cells/mg) in catfish feces during the same period. Salmonellae were detected by both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and situ hybridization in water samples immediately after inoculation, in numbers of about 10(4) cells/mL, representing up to 20% of the cells of the microbial community. Numbers decreased by three orders of magnitude within the first 3 d of the study, which represented only 0.01% of the community, and became undetectable after day 5. In catfish feces, numbers of Salmonella initially increased to up to 6% of the cells of the community but then declined. These results suggest that Salmonella are not biomagnified during gut passage, and thus, fish only provide a means for the translocation of this pathogen.

Specimens were obtained by use of gill nets and seines. Suckers taken along the south shore had a faster rate of growth than those in the more northern area. In both areas, males and females grew at the same rate in length and weight. Females lived longer and thereby became heavier. The average annual survival rate was 45%. The growth exponent was 2.88; the length-weight relationship, W = 0.000252 L2.88. Longnose suckers spawned in Hay River from the ice cover break-up in May to June 15. The water temperature did not exceed 59[degree]F (15[degree]C). The majority of spawning-run fish were 10 to 12 years old. Although sexually mature at 7 years, no suckers younger than 9 years of age were found in the spawning run. Females contained from 17,000 to 60,000 eggs but may not spawn each year. Fingerlings from Hay River were 33 to 80 mm in length, and were in their first summer.

In this paper, through the use of these remote sensing techniques, we aim to understand the type of groundwater supply of an Antarctic perennial frozen lake that encompasses two frost blisters (M1 and M2) through the temporal analysis of the features' elevation changes (frost blisters and lake ice level). The frozen lake is located at Boulder Clay (northern Victoria Land, Antarctica). We relied on several photogrammetric models, past satellite images and ground pictures to conduct differencing of digital elevation models, areal variations and pixel counting. In addition, in situ measurements of the ice sublimation or snow accumulation were carried out. The two frost blisters showed different elevation trends with M1 higher in the past (1996-2004) than recently (2014-2019), while M2 showed an opposite trend, similarly to the ice level. Indeed, the linear regression between M2 elevation changes and the ice level variation was statistically significant, as well as with the annual thawing degree days, while M1 did not show significant results. From these results we can infer that the groundwater supply of M1 can be related to a sublake open talik (hydraulic system) as confirmed also by pressurized brines found below M1, during a drilling in summer 2019. For M2 the groundwater flow is still not completely clear although the hydrostatic system seems the easiest explanation as well as for the uplift of the lake ice.

It has been recognized as a potential manipulator to control harmful algal blooms due to its filtration on algal cells. In this study, the control effect of B. aeruginosa on toxic and non-toxic Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa), and the accumulation and depuration of microcystins (MCs) in the snail were systematically explored. Results indicated that although toxic M. aeruginosa could protect itself via pro-ducing MCs, the introduction of B. aeruginosa could still effectively inhibit the algae with cell density below 1 x 106 cells/mL. Hepatopancreas was the primary target of MCs in all tissues of B. aeruginosa, presenting a maximum of 3089.60 ng/g DW when exposed to toxic M. aeruginosa of 1.0 x 107 cells/mL. The enrichment of MCs in other tissues following the order of digestive tract > gonad > mantle > muscle. Interestingly, snail could again excrete previously enriched MCs when transferred to non-toxic M. aeruginosa, giving rise to over 80% reduction of MCs in the body. After depuration, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of free MCs in intact individuals and the edible parts of B. aeruginosa were both lower than the tolerable daily intake (TDI). These results implicated that B. aeruginosa could control low density of M. aeruginosa in spring. Particularly, the snail could be perfectly safe to consume by purifying for a while after using as manipulator.					guan, wanchun/AAI-1692-2021	guan, wanchun/0000-0003-0427-9320													0147-6513	1090-2414				MAR 1	2023	252								114596	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114596		FEB 2023						36738609					WOS:000963426700001

Sediments investigated at Myslow point to a transition from glacifluvial to glaciolacustrine environments. The bulk of the sediments was deposited in deep-water Gilbert-type deltas (A-E complexes). A delta plain (topset) gradually passes into a subaerial plateau and then a clastic shoreline and the subaquatic slope of a prograding delta (foreset). The glaciolacustrine lithofacies represent a number of lake-basin environments, from marginal subaqueous slopes to distal parts of a subaqueous fan. Glaciolacustrine and glaciodeltaic deposits locally reach similar to 50-70 m in thickness. Analyses of A-E complexes indicate that the lake existed for more than 130 years and that its origin and evolution were closely connected with the ice front. This case study records lake sedimentation at an ice-sheet margin with cohesionless gravity flows, turbidity currents, debris-avalanching and, to a much lesser degree, parapelagic suspension fall-out and ice-raft dumping. In the initial stage, the lake extended more than 10 km to the south, and the deposition was relatively slow. In the second stage, recession of the ice sheet caused rapid growth of a delta. The third and ultimate stage coincided with the final glacial recession, with rapid deposition occurring only on the lake bottom. The model of the glaciolacustrine environment presented here may also be applicable to many other proglacial lakes in mountain areas.

Our objective was to show the interest of these micro-chemical methods to investigate the distribution of U and some other elements as Ca, Sr, and Si in speleothems. The sample studied was a corallite concretion that formed slowly by the precipitation of minerals from moisture that had condensed underground. Polished sections of the sample revealed alternating laminas of gray calcite and white aragonite. The concretion, which is older than 400 Kyr (U/Th-TIMS), showed no signs of detrital contamination (Th-230/Th-232>10,000). Digital autoradiography and XRF analyses indicated exceptionally high uranium contents, ranging from 3-10 to more than 1300 mu g.g(-1) in different areas of the sample. Element maps for calcium (Ca), uranium (U), strontium (Sr) and silicon (Si) showed inverse correlations between Ca and U and between Ca and Si, but there is a strong correlation between Si and U. Under the optical microscope, the low Ca appears as corrosion voids, which were found to contain uranium-enriched amorphous silica replacing areas of aragonite and, in some cases, calcite. This postgenetic amorphous and uraniferous silica is composed of two kinds of opal: opal A formed by large microspheres of 30-40 mu m in diameter and a gray opal CT with irregular lepispheres. This late opal, dated around 385-412 Kyr, is probably due to a special volcanic event formed by uraniferous glass ashes easily soluble by meteoric waters, as suggested by the presence of volcanic suite in the fine fraction of the opal. Opal precipitated after speleothem crystallization by evaporation or cryogenic supersaturation. The study of this exceptional concretion shows the value of direct chemical imaging methods, as they easily revealed the presence and distribution of U in the concretion, and allowed an unusual case of opal diagenesis in a carbonate speleothem to be described. Given the value of speleothems as geo-chronometers and recorders of environmental changes at different time scales, from season to isotopic stage, this methodology opens new perspectives in understanding the geochemical system and consequently the validity of radiometric datings, U/Th and U/Pb, especially in speleothem samples.

However, estimated emissions are associated with high uncertainties due to limited knowledge about the temporal variability in emissions and their associated controls, such as air-water gas transfer velocity. Here, we determined the gas transfer velocity of CH4 based on a novel measurement setup that combines simultaneous eddy covariance flux measurements with continuously monitored CH4 water- and air-side concentrations. Measurements were conducted during a 10-d campaign in a freshwater lake in mid-Sweden. The gas transfer velocity fell within the range of existing wind-speed-based parameterizations derived for carbon dioxide in other lakes. For wind speeds below 4 m s(-1), the gas transfer velocity for CH4 followed parameterizations predicting faster gas exchange, while for wind speeds above 5 m s(-1), it aligned with those predicting relatively lower gas exchange. This pattern can be explained by ebullition. Extending the wind speed range for such combined eddy covariance measurements with continuously monitored CH4 water- and air-side concentrations would improve model reliability.																				2378-2242				AUG	2025	10	4					566	575		10.1002/lol2.70028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.70028		MAY 2025											WOS:001492820900001

Climatic Changes in the Arctic Regions of Eastern Siberia over the Last Millenium according to the Lithological-Geochemical Data on Bottom Sediments of Peyungda Lake (Krasnoyarsk Krai, Evenkia)	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												Scanning micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis with synchrotron radiation was applied to obtain the depth-variation profiles of element compositions of banded clays in Peyungda Lake (Krasnoyarsk krai, Evenkia) located 30 km southwest of the epicenter of the Tunguska event (1908). The age model was confirmed by a dated layer of anomalous thickness related to the fall and explosion of the Tunguska Cosmic Body (TCB). The variations in the element content in dated core layers were compared with the instrumental meteorological observation data over the last century. The regional average annual temperature and element compositions of the coeval bottom sediments (transfer function) were found to be interrelated. The approximation of the transfer function to the sampling depth of the sedimentary section made it possible to reconstruct the air temperature in the studied region over the past 1000 years. The average annual temperature reconstructions in the study area compared with the global temperature reconstructions in the Arctic region for the same period made it possible to reveal general trends and extreme values.

The precipitation deficit was compensated by the groundwater outflow of a limestone unconfined aquifer. Since the 1970's when the entire region be.-an to be irrigated the piezometric level has continuously increased with a rate of about 15 cm/year. As a consequence of this mismanagement, the lake level rose by 2m and the TDS fell to a half of its natural value. In order to analyze the possible remedial measures a finite element model at the hydrogeological scale of the aquifer has been performed. Model calibration was based on the piezometric levels recorded during 25 years in 40 wells. By trial and error procedure, both transmissivities as the accretion flow were estimated using the piezometric surface recorded at the beginning of the irrigation. Reproducing piezometric history as well as the total discharge as resulted from hydraulic balance of the lake validated the model calibration. The remedial solution started from the model results where the zones with the most important values of outflow were delineated. As a consequence an earth dam, isolating the most important fresh water inflow in the lake separated one of the bays.

Rapid Pleistocene desiccation and the future of Africa's Lake Victoria	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The effects of precipitation changes on tropical East African ecosystems and human populations is poorly understood due to the complex interplay between global and regional processes and missing data from key regions and time periods. We generate a water-budget model for Lake Victoria, the largest tropical lake in the world, the source of the White Nile, and a region that supports some of the densest human populations in Africa, that assesses the impact of changing climate on lake levels and the rate of lake level change. Model results demonstrate that significant changes in the size and volume of Lake Victoria are possible in response to changes in temperature, precipitation, and orbital forcing. This modeling indicates that Lake Victoria can transition back and forth between modern lake levels and complete desiccation in centuries to a few millennia, which is rapid enough to allow for two previously observed desiccation events between 14-18 ka, during which time the lake drained and refilled twice. Combined observations from modeling and estimates of paleoprecipitation indicate that Lake Victoria was likely desiccated between 94-36 ka. This dry interval partially overlaps the megadrought (140-70 ka) identified in Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika further south, and the cooler, drier conditions identified in the Gulf of Aden between 75-50 ka. This prolonged desiccation was probably driven by eccentricity-enhanced precession and high-latitude forcing that affected the Congo Air Boundary convergence. Using future climate projections, our model also predicts that at current rates of temperature change and previous rates of lake level fall, Lake Victoria could have no outlet to the White Nile within 10 years, and Kenya could lose access to the lake in <400 years, which would significantly affect the economic resources supplied by Lake Victoria to the East African Community.

J	Dörnhöfer, K; Klinger, P; Heege, T; Oppelt, N				Doernhoefer, Katja; Klinger, Philip; Heege, Thomas; Oppelt, Natascha			Multi-sensor satellite and in situ monitoring of phytoplankton development in a eutrophic-mesotrophic lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Phytoplankton indicated by its photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll-a is an important pointer on lake ecology and a regularly monitored parameter within the European Water Framework Directive. Along with eutrophication and global warming cyanobacteria gain increasing importance concerning human health aspects. Optical remote sensing may support both the monitoring of horizontal distribution of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria at the lake surface and the reduction of spatial uncertainties associated with limited water sample analyses. Temporal and spatial resolution of using only one satellite sensor, however, may constrain its information value. To discuss the advantages of a multi-sensor approach the sensor-independent, physically based model MIP (Modular Inversion and Processing System) was applied at Lake Kummerow, Germany, and lake surface chlorophyll-a was derived from 33 images of five different sensors (MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, Landsat 8, Landsat 7 and Sentinel-2A). Remotely sensed lake average chlorophyll-a concentration showed a reasonable development and varied between 2.3 +/- 0.4 and 35.8 +/- 2.0 mg.m(-3) from July to October 2015. Match-ups between in situ and satellite chlorophyll-a revealed varying performances of Landsat 8 (RMSE: 3.6 and 19.7 mg.m(-3)), Landsat 7 (RMSE: 6.2 mg.m(-3)), Sentinel-2A (RMSE: 5.1 mg.m(-3)) and MODIS (RMSE: 12.8 mg.m(-3)), whereas an in situ data uncertainty of 48% needs to be respected. The temporal development of an index on harmful algal blooms corresponded well with the cyanobacteria biomass development during summer months. Satellite chlorophyll-a maps allowed to follow spatial patterns of chlorophyll-a distribution during a phytoplankton bloom event. Wind conditions mainly explained spatial patterns. Integrating satellite chlorophyll-a into trophic state assessment resulted in different trophic classes. Our study endorsed a combined use of satellite and in situ chlorophyll-a data to alleviate weaknesses of both approaches and to better characterise and understand phytoplankton development in lakes.

Levels of Renibacterium salmoninarum antigens in resident and anadromous salmonids in the River Ellidaar system in Iceland	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												In relation to stock enhancement programmes, wild salmon broodfish have been routinely screened for the presence of Renibacterium salmoninarum antigens (Rs-Ag) for decades. A sudden increase in the prevalence of Rs-Ag experienced caused extensive problems to this industry as eggs from positive fish are discarded. The prevalence and level of Rs-Ag were examined in resident and anadromous salmonids in the River Ellidaar system and the progress of Rs-Ag in a cohort of salmon followed. Both prevalence and Rs-Ag levels were high in resident salmonids and emigrating salmon smolts in the river system. When the smolts re-entered their home river as adults the following summer, they were almost free of Rs-Ag, but the longer they stayed in the river, the more Rs-Ag they acquired; the majority being positive at spawning. This study demonstrates a high level of Rs-Ag in salmonids in the River Ellidaar system which significantly reduces in the salmon during its seawater phase. Accordingly, it seems ideal to sample salmon broodfish as soon as possible after ascending the river and subsequently transfer to Rs-free environment for storage until stripping, which could result in lower Rs-prevalence and minimize the problems that stock enhancement programmes have faced due to Rs-positive wild broodfish.

J	Copeland, SR				Copeland, Sandi R.			Vegetation and plant food reconstruction of lowermost Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, using modern analogs	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												Vegetation and plant foods for hominins of lowermost Bed II, Olduvai Gorge were modeled by examining vegetation in modern habitats in northern Tanzania (Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro, Serengeti) that are analogous to the paleolandscape in terms of climate, land forms, and soil types, as indicated by previous paleoenvironmental studies of Olduvai. Plant species in the modern habitats were identified in a series of sample plots, and those known to be eaten by modern humans, chimpanzees, or baboons were considered potentially edible for early hominins. Within the 50-80 kyr deposition of lowermost Bed II, periods of drier climate were characterized by low lake stands and a broad eastern lacustrine plain containing a mosaic of springs, marsh, woodland, and edaphic grassland. Based on results of this study, plant food diversity in each of those habitats was relatively low, but the mosaic nature of the area meant that hominins could reach several different habitat types within short distances, with access to potential plant foods including marsh plants, grass grains, roots, shrub fruits, edible parts from palms, leafy herbaceous plants, and Acacia pods, flowers, and gum. Based on Manyara analogs, a greater variety of plant foods, such as tree fruits (e.g., Ficus, Trichilia) and the roots and fruits of shrubs (e.g., Cordia, Salvadora) would be expected further east along the rivers in the lacustrine terrace and alluvial fans. Interfluves of the alluvial fans were probably less wooded and offered relatively fewer varieties of plant foods, but there is sparse paleoenvironmental evidence for the character of Olduvai's alluvial fans, making the choice of appropriate modern analogs difficult. In the western side of the basin, based on modern analogs in the Serengeti, riverine habitats provided the greatest variety of edible plant food species (e.g., Acacia, Grewia, Justicia). If the interfluves were grassland, then a large variety of potentially edible grasses and forbs were present seasonally. Periods of wetter climate resulted in a much expanded paleolake and a shrinking of the eastern lacustrine plain mosaic into a narrow zone. The dominant landscape features were then forest-lined rivers in the eastern alluvial fans, and rivers in the western side of the paleo-Olduvai basin were also better watered at these times, supporting denser woody vegetation with large varieties of edible fruits, leaves, and underground parts.

Microcystins, chlorophyll a, soluble reactive phosphorus and stoichiometric seston ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were measured on the same samples to provide an ecological characterization of the phytoplankton. The V3 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA and aminotransferase (AMT) genes, microcystin (mcyE) and nodularin (nda) were analyzed with PCR-DGGE and quantitative real-time PCR to describe cyanobacterial communities. DGGE results indicated species capable of producing microcystins were present at some point in all study sites and were most likely from species within the genus Microcystis. Concentrations of microcystins were greatest when hepatotoxic cell numbers were highest and when seston stoichiometry indicated cells were not nutrient stressed. This study demonstrated the effective use of a combination of molecular and ecological monitoring of cyanobacterial communities in regions that are susceptible to toxic cyanobacteria blooms.

In this study, comprehensive analyses were conducted on a dataset spanning over 20 years (1998-2018) of hydrological regime and physicochemical parameters from the Yangtze River basin to evaluate the potential impacts of the Three Gorges Dam. Water level significantly increased from 128.75 +/- 58.18 m in 2002 to 136.78 +/- 55.05 m in 2005, and the mean flow velocity significantly decreased from 2004 to 2010. However, no significant change in the flow was observed in the basin. Meanwhile, remarkable fluctuations in physicochemical parameters, including dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, conductivity, hardness, and alkalinity, were mainly observed during impoundment (2003-2009). After that, the above parameters tended to stabilize, and some even returned to their original levels. The dam's retention effect significantly reduced the suspended solids (SS) in both up- and downstream, to only one-third of the preoperation level. And total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand also significantly decreased with the decline of SS. Particularly, ammonium also showed a significant downward trend, with the up- and downstream of the dam falling by 36.8 % and 26.1 %, respectively. However, the increasing total nitrogen (7.5 % and 20.0 % up- and downstream of the dam, respectively) still threatened the water quality of the basin, especially in the estuaries. Additionally, the significant decline in dissolved oxygen downstream (from 8.53 +/- 1.08 mg/L to 8.11 +/- 1.36 mg/L) also exacerbated the hypoxia in the Yangtze River estuary. The results demonstrated the long-term impact of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the environmental elements of the Yangtze River basin, which provides reference data and guidance for the construction of big dams in major rivers in the future.

Quantifying the retention and loss of mercury is integral for predicting mercury-sensitive ecosystems. There is little information on how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and particulates affect mercury photoreaction kinetics in freshwater lakes. To address this knowledge gap, samples were collected from ten lakes in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia (DOC: 2.6-15.4 mg/L). Filtered (0.2 mu m) and unfiltered samples were analysed for gross photoreduction, gross photooxidation, and net reduction rates of mercury using pseudo first-order curves. Unfiltered samples had higher concentrations (p = 0.04) of photoreducible divalent mercury (Hg(II)(RED)) (mean of 754 +/- 253 pg/L) than filtered samples (mean of 482 +/- 206 pg/L); however, gross photoreduction and photooxidation rate constants were not significantly different in filtered or unfiltered samples in early summer. DOC was not significantly related to gross photoreduction rate constants in filtered (R-2 = 0.43; p = 0.08) and unfiltered (R-2 = 0.02; p = 0.71) samples; DOC was also not significantly related to gross photooxidation rate constants in filtered or unfiltered samples. However, DOC was significantly negatively related with Hg(II) RED in unfiltered (R-2 = 0.53; p = 0.04), but not in filtered samples (R-2 = 0.04; p = 0.60). These trends indicate that DOC is a factor in determining dissolved mercury photoreduction rates and particles partially control available Hg(II) RED in lake water. This research also demonstrates that within these lakes gross photoreduction and photooxidation processes are close to being in balance. Changes to catchment inputs of particulate matter and DOC may alter mercury retention in these lakes and could partially explain observed increases of mercury accumulation in biota.

SETTING: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Bilateral phacoemulsification with IOL implantation was performed in 6 New Zealand rabbits. Each animal received a study (accommodating) IOL and a control (1-piece hydrophobic acrylic) IOL. Eyes were examined at the slitlamp from 1 day through 6 weeks postoperatively. The globes were then enucleated and evaluated grossly. Capsular bag opacification was scored from the posterior aspect (Miyake-Apple view). The eyes were then processed for complete histopathologic evaluation. RESULTS: At 6 weeks, the mean posterior capsule opacification (PCO) clinical score was 0.5 +/- 0.3 (SD) in the study group and 3.0 +/- 0.9 in the control group (P=.001, 2-tail paired t test). Anterior capsule opacification was practically absent in the study group and mild in the control group. Miyake-Apple posterior view showed a mean central PCO score of 0 +/- 0 in the study group and 3.0 +/- 1.1 in the control group (P=.001), peripheral PCO score of 0.7 +/- 0.4 and 3.5 +/- 0.8 (P=.0006), respectively, and Soemmerring ring score of 2.3 +/- 0.8 and 7.0 +/- 2.8 (P=.01), respectively. Histopathology showed no signs of toxicity in any eye. CONCLUSIONS: The study IOL maintained an expanded capsular bag secondary to the large size of the haptic elements, which appears to prevent capsular bag opacification.																			0886-3350					SEP	2013	39	9					1415	1420		10.1016/j.jcrs.2013.01.051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2013.01.051								23831157					WOS:000324014300019
J	Boutilier, RG				Boutilier, RG			Mechanisms of metabolic defense against hypoxia in hibernating frogs	RESPIRATION PHYSIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Experimental-Biology	JUL 30-AUG 03, 2000	CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	Soc Exptl Biol				The cold submerged frog (Rana temporaria) serves as a useful model for many hibernating ectotherms that take refuge in hypoxic ponds and lakes until more favourable conditions of climate and food availability return. In all such animals, entry into a hypometabolic state effectively extends their survival time by lessening the impact of ATP demands on endogenous substrates. At the cellular level, metabolic depression may be brought about by decreasing energy-consuming processes and/or by increasing the efficiency of energy-producing pathways. Since the mitochondrion is the major contributor to the total energy production during aerobic metabolism and frog survival during winter depends on entry into a hypometabolic state, this review focuses on the respiratory properties of mitochondria that serve to increase the efficiency of energy production in hibernation. Energy conservation during overwintering also occurs through decreases in the ATP demand of the energy-consuming processes. For example, hibernating frogs decrease their ATP demands for Na+/K+-ATPase activity as part of a coordinated process of energy conservation wherein O-2-limitation initiates a generalised suppression of ion channel densities and/or channel leak activities. The net result is that cell membrane permeabilities are reduced, thereby lowering the energetic costs of maintaining transmembrane ion gradients. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Reestablishment of wet conditions occurred ca, 13,000 yr B,P, The Holocene is represented by stratified lake deposits that alternate with fluvial and eolian deposits, indicating a longterm oscillating trend toward arid conditions, The existence of widespread freshwater lakes during the late Pleistocene indicates a semihumid climate without an accompanying fall in temperature to arctic conditions.

This study applied two-stage nanobubble technology, combining hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone nanobubbles, in a 3300 m2 semi-enclosed area of Taihu Lake to address these gaps. Results show that the technology efficiently controls algae, reduces odors, improves anaerobic conditions, and lowers ammonia nitrogen. Over 20 days, chlorophyll-a concentration reduced by 77.46% and cyanobacterial phycocyanin by 89.47%. Additionally, the concentrations of 2-MIB, GSM, and DMTS fell below threshold values. Notably, the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria in sediment dropped from 8.53% in the control area to only 1.59%-3.65% in the experimental area. The technology also achieved a significant reduction in ammonia nitrogen, with removal efficiencies of 78.53% in the water column and 39.17% in sediments, though the removal of total phosphorus was limited. Furthermore, the two-stage nanobubble system enhanced the abundance of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms and genes in the water, while promoting nitrogen- and phosphorus-related microbial communities in sediments and inhibiting the cyanobacteria-associated genus Cyanobium PCC-6307. Thus, Two-stage nanobubble technology can be employed for in-situ algal control in aquatic ecosystems.

Supplementary information is given about the not so well known benthic copepod fauna in Finnish lakes. Assuming unimodal relationships between the species' relative abundances and lake productivity, a weighted averaging regression and calibration model to infer lake trophic level from harpacticoid assemblages in upper profundal depth was constructed and evaluated using the available data from Finnish lakes. The epilimnetic total phosphorus was used as the measure of lake trophic level. In different comparisons the harpacticoid-inferred and observed total phosphorus was significantly correlated and the root mean squared error of prediction estimated by bootstrap or cross-validation methods was tolerable (3.3-5.1 mug 1-1). The results prove harpacticoids as potential trophic indicators and demonstrate the applicability of weighted averaging approach in biological indication using benthic invertebrates. Larger numbers of benthic cyclopoid resting stages were observed in lake areas of higher trophic level, but it was concluded that the phenomenon cannot be explained by decreased fish predation resulting from oxygen deficiency, as recently suggested. Two alternative explanations are hypothesized.

J	Chen, W; Kan, AT; Fu, GM; Tomson, MB				Chen, W; Kan, AT; Fu, GM; Tomson, MB			Factors affecting the release of hydrophobic organic contaminants from natural sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Numerous physical and chemical changes in aquatic systems can affect the sorption and desorption of organic contaminants. In this study, the effects of competitive sorption, caustic treatment, and temperature on the release of sorbed chlorinated hydrocarbons and naphthalene from natural sediments were studied. The experiments were specially designed so that the results would reflect the nature of the irreversible compartment. The effect of competitive sorption fell into two categories. The release of chlorinated benzenes and hexachlorobutadiene from the reversible fraction in Lake Charles, Louisiana, USA, sediment was increased with the competitive sorption of naphthalene, while the release of naphthalene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene from the irreversible compartments in Dickinson, Texas, USA, sediment was unaffected by the sorption of trans-cinnamic acid at 100 mg/L. Similarly, preliminary experiments showed that caustic treatment of sediments did not enhance the desorption from the irreversible fraction. Also, the enthalpy of sorption associated with the irreversible compartment was -21.60 +/- 0.76 kJ/mol, indicating that sorption was via simple van der Waal's forces. Experimental results in this study support a previously proposed irreversible sorption mechanism in which irreversible sorption is attributed to the physical entrapment of organic molecules in sediment matrices after the hydrophobic partitioning.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				OCT	2000	19	10					2401	2408		10.1002/etc.5620191003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620191003													WOS:000089676600003

However, the lack of reliable long-term data has limited our understanding of bloom dynamics in inland lakes. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of algal bloom phenology in Lake Taihu using daily MODIS data from 2000 to 2023. The floating algae index (FAI) and Bayesian land surface phenology (BLSP) model were applied to quantify bloom patterns and explore their climatic and environmental drivers. Over the past 24 years, algal bloom coverage in Lake Taihu averaged 19.88 %, with severe events occurring in 2007 and 2017, reaching frequencies of 9.54 % and 10.60 % and coverages of 42.92 % and 41.10 %, respectively. Bloom durations ranged from 60 to 90 days, typically starting between March and June and ending between July and December. Notably, since 2015, blooms have shown a tendency to start earlier, persist longer, and end later. Bloom phenology was primarily driven by water quality, with wind speed and cumulative evaporation also playing significant roles. These findings provide new insights into the driving mechanisms behind algal bloom phenology and serve as a scientific basis for developing effective lake ecological management strategies and water quality improvement initiatives.																			1568-9883	1878-1470				SEP	2025	148								102917	10.1016/j.hal.2025.102917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2025.102917		JUL 2025						40835341					WOS:001539816400001

We combine sedimentology, paleopedology, palynology, and paleontology in order to reconstruct detailed local paleoenvironments of an ancient Arctic coastal plain. The Prince Creek Fm. contains quartz- and chert-rich sandstone and mudstone-filled trunk and distributary channels and floodplains composed of organic-rich siltstone and mudstone, carbonaceous shale, coal, and ash-fall deposits. Compound and cumulative, weakly developed soils formed on levees, point bars, crevasse splays, and along the margins of floodplain lakes, ponds, and swamps. Abundant organic matter, carbonaceous root traces, Fe-oxide depletion coatings, and zoned peds (soil aggregates with an outermost Fe-depleted zone, darker-colored Fe-rich matrix, and lighter-colored Fe-poor center) indicate periodic waterlogging, anoxia, and gleying, consistent with a high water table. In contrast, Fe-oxide mottles, ferruginous and manganiferous segregations, bioturbation, and rare illuvial clay coatings indicate recurring oxidation and periodic drying of some soils. Trampling of sediments by dinosaurs is common. A marine influence on pedogenesis in distal coastal plain settings is indicated by jarosite mottles and halos surrounding rhizoliths and the presence of pyrite and secondary gypsum. Floodplains were dynamic, and soil-forming processes were repeatedly interrupted by alluviation, resulting in weakly developed soils similar to modern aquic subgroups of Entisols and Inceptisols and, in more distal locations, potential acid sulfate soils. Biota, including peridinioid dinocysts, brackish and freshwater algae, fungal hyphae, fern and moss spores, projectates, age-diagnostic Wodehouseia edmontonicola, hinterland bisaccate pollen, and pollen from lowland trees, shrubs, and herbs record a diverse flora and indicate an Early Maastrichtian age for all sediments in the study area. The assemblage also demonstrates that although all sediments are Early Maastrichtian, strata become progressively younger from south to north. A paleoenvironmental reconstruction integrating pedogenic processes and biota indicates that polar woodlands with an angiosperm understory and dinosaurs flourished on this ancient Arctic coastal plain that was influenced by seasonally(?) fluctuating water table levels and floods. In contrast to modern polar environments, there is no evidence for periglacial conditions on the Cretaceous Arctic coastal plain, and both higher temperatures and an intensified hydrological cycle existed, although the polar light regime was similar to that of the present. In the absence of evidence of cryogenic processes in paleosols, it would be very difficult to determine a high-latitude setting for paleosol formation without independent evidence for paleolatitude. Consequently, paleosols formed at high latitudes under greenhouse conditions, in the absence of ground ice, are not likely to have unique pedogenic signatures.					; Flaig, Peter/B-7942-2011	Fiorillo, Anthony/0000-0002-8998-0820; Flaig, Peter/0000-0002-4702-2157													1060-071X		978-1-56576-322-7				2013		104					179	230		10.2110/sepmsp.104.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/sepmsp.104.14													WOS:000332676600014

These threats can lead to changes in ecological conditions and community composition of ostracod species. Overall, reduction in habitat quality may increase the number of tolerant (e.g., generalist) species in relation to the number of native (e.g., specialist) species. This phenomenon is called pseudorichness and is also characterized by a critical increase in the total numbers of colonial bacteria. A total of 16 ostracod species were encountered in Lake Abant (Bolu, Turkey) and its environs between 2001 and 2003. Two species (Psychrodromus fontinalis, Eucypris pigra) found outside the lake are new records for the region. About 80% of the species in this area have a cosmopolitan distribution throughout the Holarctic region. Four major clustering groups (UPGMA) were recognized based on species occurrences and ecological preferences. Each species was distinctly tolerant to different ecological variables though cosmopolitan species tended to have wider tolerance ranges compared to sensitive species. About 82% of the relationship between species and environmental variables was explained with Canonical Correspondence Analysis (P<0.05). Accordingly, temperature, dissolved oxygen and conductivity of water were found to be the three most influential factors affecting species composition. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship (P<0.01) between the number of individuals and both dissolved oxygen and the number of species. Generally, to provide long-term conservation of the Lake Abant Nature Park, immediate attention is needed for the wastewater treatment, and help from international organizations.

Both N and P acted as potential limiting factors to phytoplankton growth in short-term (4-5 d) bioassays. Phytoplankton responded strongly to single additions of N or P in 1990 and 1992 but weakly so in 1991. This difference was associated with low inorganic N concentrations during spring 1991. In 1990 and 1991, variation of the primary limiting element correlated with the N:P ratio df the zooplankton community; phytoplankton tended to be N limited when the zooplankton was dominated by species with high N:P ratios (Diaptomus novamexicanus and Diacyclops thomasi: N:P ratios, by mass = 10.6-12.5) but limited by P when low N:P taxa (Daphnia rosea, N:P = 4.7) dominated. However, N vs. P limitation and zooplankton elemental data for 1992 did not fit the 1990-1991 pattern and there was no correlation for the 3-year data set. A field experiment demonstrated that the inorganic N:P ratio (NH4/SRP) increased dramatically with elevated Daphnia grazing but declined significantly with increased Diaptomus; this supported the 1990-1991 -correlation between phytoplankton N/P limitation status and zooplankton community elemental ratio.

However, very few studies have been focused on lake water mass. Also, there is a lack of studies performed after 2004-2009 period when the enforcement of most international organic pollutant banning policies (e.g., The Stockholm convention) occurred. We report concentration of 66 different semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCs) in the Sabocos tarn water mass (a Spanish Pyrenees cirque glacial lake) from 2011 to 2014. Analyzed SOCs include compounds of current and past use with different sources (i.e., current and historic-use pesticides, industrial and urban-use compounds, and combustion by-products) and chemical properties (i.e., volatility, water solubility, and persistence in the environment). Most banned chemicals such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroetanes (DDTs), aldrins, most polybromodiphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, endosulfans, triazine, and simazine were detected in consistently low concentrations. In contrast, chemicals still in use such as BDE-209, terbutilazine, diuron, metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos were found in higher and more variable amounts. Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were high as compared to previous studies in other Pyrenean and European lakes suggesting airborne pollution from nearby anthropogenic sources. Overall, levels of hexacyclohexanes (HCHs) during most of the sampling period were low according to other studies in similar environments. However, the Sabocos water mass recorded a concentration peak of some HCH isomers in summer 2014 related with the HCH residues transfer operation at the nearby (20 km) BailIn landfill site (Sabinanigo, Spain).

Freshwater algae are considered biological indicators of environmental change and can be useful in assessing the impact of global climate change and increased environmental pollution. In this study, freshwater microeukaryotes in an Arctic reservoir at Ny-C(0)lesund (Svalbard, Norway) were studied using the hypervariable V1-V3 small subunit rRNA and 454 pyrosequencing. On the basis of 8,956 reads, we revealed high genetic diversity in eukaryotes, representing all known eukaryotic supergroups, except Excavata. "Chromalveolata" (previously supergroup Chromalveolata) and Archaeplastida were the most and least abundant supergroups, respectively. After data mining, 57 phylotypes were detected from 7,398 pyrosequences. They were dominated by stramenopiles (84 %) and Dinoflagellata (13 %), with minor contributions from Cryptophyta, Chlorophyta, and Telonemida. The detection of algae belonging to the orders Mamiellales and Monomastigales provides a window into a fraction of the 'rare biosphere' that had previously been undetected in such environments. Interestingly, no haptophytes were recorded. Stramenopiles and Dinoflagellata mainly comprised taxa belonging to the families Chrysophyceae, Synurophyceae, and Dinophyceae. On the basis of the proportion of operational taxonomic units, the dominant phylotypes were found to include Ochromonas spp., Mallomonas spp., and Uroglena americana. These results demonstrate the significance of a chrysophyte-dominated microeukaryotic community, which is of great potential for future studies in terms of reconstruction of past climate trends and monitoring of environmental change in the Arctic.

J	LaBelle, JM; Holliday, VT; Meltzer, DJ				LaBelle, JM; Holliday, VT; Meltzer, DJ			Early Holocene Paleoindian deposits at Nall playa, Oklahoma Panhandle, USA	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Fieldwork conducted at the Nall North locale and the adjacent playa documents buried Paleoindian deposits and a stratigraphic sequence dating back to the late Pleistocene. Cultural debris recovered from the surface of Nall North includes bone, tools, and lithic flake debris. Two buried paleosols at the locale date to the early Holocene and hold high potential for Paleoindian materials. The Baker paleosol, a stabilized surface above the shoreline of the adjacent playa lake, dated between ca. 6870 and 7740 yr B.P., contains a rich cultural component of tools, flakes, and bone, and represents a potential surface for Angostura and Allen/Frederick artifacts. Located below the Baker soil is the Nall soil (dated to ca. 9650 yr B.P.) that probably represents a marsh facies of the playa fill. The Nall soil represents a potential surface for Plainview/Goshen-age artifacts, although excavations thus far have recovered no cultural debris. In the playa adjacent to the Nall North locality, a sequence dating between ca. 12,960 and 5310 yr B.P. documents localized spring flow into the playa during the late Pleistocene, followed by several thousand years of playa muds during the early Holocene, and the eventual drying of the playa in the middle Holocene.

Thermokarst in Siberian ice-rich permafrost: Comparison to asymmetric scalloped depressions on Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												On Earth, the thawing of permafrost deposits with high-ground ice content results in massive surface subsidence and the formation of characteristic large thermokarst depressions. Slope asymmetries within thermokarst depressions suggest lateral growth, which occurs due to thermoerosion and gravimetric mass wasting along these slopes. It has been proposed that rimless, asymmetrically shaped depressions (called scalloped depressions) on Mars were formed by insolation-driven ground ice sublimation. We investigated a large thermokarst depression in ice complex deposits in the Siberian Arctic as a terrestrial analogue for scalloped depressions in Martian volatile-rich mantle deposits. Our results from field studies, insolation modeling, and geomorphometric analyses suggest lateral thermokarst development in a northern direction. This conclusion is obvious due to steeper slope angles of the south facing slopes. Insolation and surface temperatures are crucial factors directly influencing thermokarst slope stability and steepness. Comparative analyses of Martian scalloped depressions in Utopia Planitia were conducted using high-resolution (High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, Context Camera) and thermal infrared (Thermal Emission Imaging System) satellite data. By direct analogy, we propose that the lateral scalloped depression development on Mars was primarily forced on the steep pole-facing slopes in the equator-ward direction. Insolation modeling confirms that this must have happened in the last 10 Ma during an orbital configuration of higher obliquity than today. Development would have been maximized if the orbit was both highly oblique and highly eccentric, and/or the Martian summer coincided with perihelion. Relatively short events of increasing sublimation or even thawing of ground ice led to fast slumping processes on the steep pole-facing slopes.

The water of open Lake Baikal, the Little Sea (Maloe More) Strait, and large bays are characterized by a uniform Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7086266 +/- 0.0000045 (n = 44, uncertainty at 95% confidence interval). Major volumetric contributors of water to the lake (the eastern rivers and precipitation) are only slightly different from the lake value in terms of Sr-87/Sr-86. In the western rivers, Sr-87/Sr-86 is much higher, but due to their small incoming volume, their contribution is rapidly diluted by the water currents of the lake. The exception is water with high Sr-87/Sr-86 from isolated Mukhor Bay at the inland end of the Little Sea Strait and water above the underwater discharge of hydrothermal springs. Benthic and pelagic Lake Baikal animals have Sr-87/Sr-86 similar to the values of the open lake, supporting lake water homogenization. The modelled budget of Sr suggests that 86 +/- 14% of input Sr is stored in the waters of Lake Baikal. In other words, according to the estimations some Sr (from 0 to 28%) may be precipitated at the lake bottom by chemical and biochemical processes.

INFORM Africa Res Study Grp	Review of open-source software for developing heterogeneous data management systems for bioinformatics applications	BIOINFORMATICS ADVANCES												In a world where data drive effective decision-making, bioinformatics and health science researchers often encounter difficulties managing data efficiently. In these fields, data are typically diverse in format and subject. Consequently, challenges in storing, tracking, and responsibly sharing valuable data have become increasingly evident over the past decades. To address the complexities, some approaches have leveraged standard strategies, such as using non-relational databases and data warehouses. However, these approaches often fall short in providing the flexibility and scalability required for complex projects. While the data lake paradigm has emerged to offer flexibility and handle large volumes of diverse data, it lacks robust data governance and organization. The data lakehouse is a new paradigm that combines the flexibility of a data lake with the governance of a data warehouse, offering a promising solution for managing heterogeneous data in bioinformatics. However, the lakehouse model remains unexplored in bioinformatics, with limited discussion in the current literature. In this study, we review strategies and tools for developing a data lakehouse infrastructure tailored to bioinformatics research. We summarize key concepts and assess available open-source and commercial solutions for managing data in bioinformatics.Availability and implementation Not applicable.

Todd			The edge of crisis: discovery of young of year black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus (Richardson, 1846) in the Lower Mississippi River	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												Understanding changes in the status of invasive species is important to managers in order to prevent or minimize impacts to native communities. Out of the four invasive carp imported to the U.S. from Eastern Asia, black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus have been generally overlooked due to the difficulty in capturing these fish even using targeted efforts. Because of this, limited resources have been channeled towards managing this species. Concerns over the expansion of black carp have been expressed, but direct evidence of reproduction in U.S. waters was lacking until young of year black carp were caught in tributaries of the Middle Mississippi River in 2015. This remained the known extent of the naturalized invasion until fish community surveys conducted in the fall of 2022 and 2023 documented young of year black carp in three oxbow lakes connected to the mainstem Lower Mississippi River. These collections provide evidence for increased population growth and exhibit expanding threats to the diverse mussel communities native to the Lower Mississippi River basin.																			2242-1300					NOV	2024	13	4					1033	1040		10.3391/bir.2024.13.4.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2024.13.4.16													WOS:001381820700016

Fish avoidance of ships during acoustic surveys tested with quiet uncrewed surface vessels	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Acoustic surveys to estimate fish biomass and abundance are a major component of many fisheries monitoring programs. An important bias in acoustic surveys is that fish may avoid the survey vessel. Here, we utilized quiet uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) equipped with 120 kHz split beam echosounders to evaluate fish responses to motorized survey vessels. Two of these USVs were deployed in Lakes Michigan and Huron in summer 2021 and compared against three motorized vessels used in conventional fisheries acoustic surveys. Paired comparisons employed vessel-drone passes that provided the opportunity to observe fish response as vessels approached and then overtook their quiet USV counterparts. Sound originating from the vessels was primarily in the 10-1000 Hz range. Overall received sound pressure levels for ships at the closest pass were 100 dB (re 1 mu Pa @ 1 m) for one and 133-134 dB for the other two vessels. In contrast, sound originating from the USV was not detectable over ambient noise. We examined acoustic data from the USVs for potential changes in total acoustic backscatter, average target depth, and average in situ target strength as vessels approached. We observed weak evidence of an avoidance response by fish to the vessel with the loudest noise profile and highest survey speed but not for the other two vessels. We also compared acoustic data from 33 2-km transects surveyed by both vessels and the USVs, finding few differences between vessel and USV data for water depths between 5 and 80 m. Results from this work suggest that acoustics estimates of fishes in Lakes Michigan and Huron (primarily alewife, rainbow smelt, and bloater) are largely consistent among the vessels used in these two lakes for standard acoustic surveys and that fish avoidance is minimal in water depths > 5 meters.					; Warner, David/C-8858-2009; Evans, Thomas/I-2446-2019	Senczyszyn, Steven/0000-0003-4604-6525; Evans, Thomas/0000-0001-6717-4521; Dieter, Patricia M./0000-0003-1686-2679; O'Brien, Timothy/0000-0003-4502-5204; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				NOV	2023	267								106817	10.1016/j.fishres.2023.106817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2023.106817		AUG 2023											WOS:001064060500001

The interrelationship between distributional archaeology and regional taphonomy-two research programs introduced by him 30 years ago-highlights the importance of three analytical units: the region, the artifact and the element (bone). Combined with an epistemology centered on falsifiability, this is the structure for formulating broad questions mostly related to Holocene hunter-gatherer landscape use. Building on this legacy, the article presents a case study of the winter grounds on the north shore of Lake Viedma. It integrates the taphonomic results of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) with those of artifact distribution. Furthermore, we present new radiocarbon dates that frame the analysis of fauna from several archaeological sites located in the deflation hollows of coastal sand dunes. The identification of a similar set of environmental and archaeological conditions to that proposed by Borrero in 1988 in the trampling model he used for guanacos in Tierra del Fuego demonstrates the latter's relevance to the Viedma Lake region.																			0717-7356					SEP	2022	54	3					521	534		10.4067/S0717-73562021005001803	http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0717-73562021005001803													WOS:000890056300007

However, only limited studies have ever been carried out to investigate the influence of the hydraulic connection on the distribution of elements around certain salt lake. In this study, a total of 66 water samples (including river water, stream water, spring water, brine, intercrystalline brine, well water, and drilling brine) were collected around the Gas Hure salt lake (GSKLH) to investigate the relationship between hydraulic connection and uranium (U) distribution via hydrochemistry and isotope (U-234/U-238, delta B-11) techniques. The results suggested that the GSKLH was recharged by water from the Kulamulekesay and Atetikan rivers, groundwater (borehole brine and some intercrystalline brine), and deep fluid (some intercrystalline brine), with each contributing 44.03%, 14.95%, and 41.02% of total recharge, respectively. The U-bearing rock was dominated mainly by silicates, carbonates, and evaporites in the high mountain area (region 1), overflow area (region 2), and plain area (region 3) of the GSKLH, respectively. In the GSKLH, the U distribution was strongly correlated with hydraulic connection and the U concentration was influenced by both groundwater flow system and flow velocity (represented by the gamma Cl-/gamma Ca2+ ratio). Thus, U was enriched under the conditions of regional groundwater flow system and slow velocity in the GSKLH.

The County is in the rapidly urbanizing Richmond metropolitan area and this urbanizing process has stressed many small tributaries of the watershed. Conditions in the project stream reach have deposited a heavy load of sediment downstream into a shallow lake. This headwaters drainage area was "built out" prior to I development of Virginia erosion control laws and the adoption of Chesapeake Bay regulations. An environmental partnership has been developed to stabilize Cabin Branch Creek and control the erosive forces of stormwater. The early analysis detailed a mirage of problems that collectively have resulted in a highly unstable stream. Components of the restoration analysis include a detailed stream survey, hydrologic modeling using HEC-RAS and use of the Rosgen stream classification system. The strength of the project lies in the close working relationship of the public/private partnership involved. Each entity brings an expertise that provides a synergistic effect and enhances the success of the stabilization project.																			1092-2806						1997	28						187	194																WOS:000073814300018

However, variations of climate and vegetation during the Holocene remain unclear in this marginal region of the monsoon climate. Here we present a Holocene highresolution pollen record from Lake Gahai in the NETP since 11.4 (+/- 0.3) ka BP to reconstruct regional vegetation history. A quantitative reconstruction of precipitation is also tried using fossil pollen assemblages. Results suggested that before 10.2 (+/- 0.4) ka BP in the early Holocene, the vegetation cover was low and the climate was arid. A relatively wet climate indicated by high A/C ratio values occurred between 10.2 (+/- 0.4) and 7.4 (+/- 0.2) ka BP. After 7.4 (+/- 0.2) ka BP, the A/C ratio decreased, indicating that the climate was getting drier. The overall environment of the basin has become similar to modern conditions since 5.4 (+/- 0.1) ka BP. The reconstructed precipitation is not comparable with the tree-ring-based reconstruction from the Delingha region, although the reconstruction processes passed significance tests statistically. In addition to abundant surface pollen data and gradually improved quantitative reconstruction techniques, other factors such as the environmental settings and vegetation dynamics also affect the reliability of the pollen-based quantitative reconstruction of regional precipitation. Therefore, the applicability of pollen data for quantitative precipitation reconstruction in arid regions should be assessed and the results should be treated cautiously.

The urban water resources took the brunt of this uncontrolled urbanization and expansion resulting in a swift decline in lakes and ponds in the cities. Bengaluru is one of the most prominent cities in India where the urban water body areas have fallen drastically over the years. This study attempts to assess the impact of urban growth in reducing the surface area of the water bodies in Bengaluru. The study used decadal Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps between 1988 to 2020 generated from Landsat 4-5 and 8 datasets using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) technique to study and understand urban sprawl in Bengaluru and the changes occurring in water spread area. The results indicate that Bengaluru city has undergone a massive growth from 100 Sq. km to 600 Sq. km between 1988 to 2020. This excessive sprawl has blocked the ephemeral streams that replenish the water bodies, thus causing heavy damage not only to water bodies in the region but also to the vegetation present in the periphery of the expanding city.					kondraju, tarun/KAM-6741-2024																978-1-6654-2795-1				2022							138	141		10.1109/M2GARSS52314.2022.9840084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/M2GARSS52314.2022.9840084													WOS:000920444800035

However, such movement behaviour is usually studied at the population or school level, while less is known about individual movement characteristics and habitat transitions. During March 2012 to June 2013, we used acoustic tags and moored receivers to monitor the behaviour of Atlantic herring Clupea harengus L. (N = 47) throughout a range of habitats on the Skagerrak coast in southern Norway. Five of the tagged herring entered a former lake transformed into an artificial estuary by a human-made canal linking the former lake to the open ocean. Herring resided in this system for up to 36 d. All tagged herring left the fjord where they were tagged by early August 2012. This habitat transition was detected by the receivers as 3 main pulses of tagged individuals, which were as sumed to be formed by putative populations mixing in the area. Most transitions occurred during nighttime regardless of tidal cycle, and it is suggested that spawning is the primary driver for entering the fjord and artificial estuary. Later detections at a separate receiver system 17 km to the northeast suggest that some herring may overwinter in coastal areas. In the spring of 2013, 3 of the tagged herring returned to their original fjord tagging location. Our study reveals new aspects of herring migration dynamics linked to anthropogenic modifications of connectivity, and suggests that capacity for individual behaviours in schooling fish may be underestimated.					; Olsen, Esben/B-1894-2012; Moland, Even/A-7788-2013; Slotte, Aril/OBO-7933-2025; Berg, Florian/M-9678-2014	Olsen, Esben Moland/0000-0003-3807-7524; Slotte, Aril/0000-0001-9401-4929; Moland, Even/0000-0002-6521-2659; Berg, Florian/0000-0003-1543-8112													0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 3	2015	520						245	256		10.3354/meps11103	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps11103													WOS:000349302600017

Its erosion and movement has a significant impact on the soil environment. Moreover, cohesive sediment is an important part of the sediment of lakes and oceans, and its movement and transportation also have a crucial influence over dispersion of pollutants in water. Open channel flume experiments were carried out to study the characteristics of cohesive sediment movement; simultaneously the velocity and sediment concentration vertical profile was investigated. The experimental results indicate that under the conditions of suitable hydrodynamic velocity and sediment concentration, a special-shaped sediment flow, stratified movement, takes place in the flume. Its formation and features are closely related to fluid parameters and sediment concentration. Its velocity distribution shows a V-shaped pattern falling forward. At the corner of V, the maximum velocity is vertically located in the middle of the flume. The concentration distribution is vertically stratified into three discrete layers on whose interfaces the concentrations change suddenly. To form lamination movement, different hydrodynamic conditions are required under different sediment concentrations. When the concentration increases, the corresponding flow intensity also increases.																			1660-9336		978-3-03785-484-6				2012	204-208		1-5				434	439		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.204-208.434	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.204-208.434													WOS:000318817500085

However, HAdV occurrence at recreational freshwater beaches has not been previously investigated. In this study, a total of 58 water samples were collected from two recreational beaches on Lake Michigan (i.e., Silver Beach and Washington Park Beach) during the summer of 2004. Occurrences of HAdVs in these lake samples were determined using two hexon-based real-time PCR assays (one for monitoring all 51 serotypes of HAdVs and another for specifically detecting F species HAdVs, i.e., serotypes 40 and 41) and compared to an integrated cell culture (ICC) PCR method. The real-time PCR results showed that 8 of 30 Silver Beach samples and 6 of 28 Washington Park Beach samples contained HAdVs, and F species HAdVs were detected in three of these positive samples. The concentrations of HAdVs ranged from (1.7 +/- 0.7) x 10(1) to (3.4 +/- 0.8) x 10(2) and from (7 +/- 2) x 10(0) to (3.8 +/- 0.3) x 10(3) virus particles/liter for Silver Beach and Washington Park Beach, respectively. F species HAdVs were detected at levels ranging from (4.8 +/- 0.8) x 10(1) to (4.6 +/- 1.5) x 10(2) virus particles/liter. Approximately 60% of the ICC-PCR analyses agreed with the real-time PCR results. This study revealed the occurrence of HAdVs at Lake Michigan recreational beaches. Given the potential health risks, further assessment regarding sources, virus transport, and survival is needed to improve the safety of the region.

J	Huttunen, A				Huttunen, Antti			Holocene vegetation history of the Riisitunturi fell area in NE Finland, traced by the palynostratigraphy of two disgenic upland lakes	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												A palynological study of an upland lake was conducted in NE Finland to assess the timing of post-glacial vegetational phases as accurately as is possible with bulk samples of hard water-free, evenly deposited sediment. The studied lake, Kolmiloukkonen, as a reference site for the Kuusamo region, revealed an age of ca. 10 580 cal. years BP for the beginning of the post-glacial period, ca. 9500-9200 calBP for the appearance of alder, ca. 5700 calBP for spruce by 1% of arboreal pollen, and ca. 3900 calBP for spruce rise. DCA ordination suggested rather stagnant plant communities in the mid-Holocene. Another lake from the midHolocene on top of a saddle mire in the oroboreal sparsely wooded heath was of secondary origin. Its sediment types and macrosubfossils showed an uncommon succession from heath forest to mire and finally to a water basin. The age of establishment of nearly open summits could not be pinpointed palynologically, however, some signals suggest a trend towards more open communities nearly 3000 calBP and about a millennium ago.																			1239-6095					AUG 27	2007	12	4					515	534																WOS:000249338000005

Treatment of haemophilia A and B and von Willebrand's disease: summary and conclusions of a systematic review as part of a Swedish health-technology assessment	HAEMOPHILIA												. In an ongoing health-technology assessment of haemophilia treatment in Sweden, performed by the governmental agency Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV; tandva degrees rds-och lakemedelsforma degrees nsverket), the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU; statens beredning for medicinsk utvardering) was called upon to evaluate treatment of haemophilia A and B and von Willebrands disease (VWD) with clotting factor concentrates. To evaluate the following questions: What are the short-term and long-term effects of different treatment strategies? What methods are available to treat haemophilia patients that have developed inhibitors against factor concentrates Based on the questions addressed by the project, a systematic database search was conducted in PubMed, NHSEED, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and other relevant databases. The literature search covered all studies in the field published from 1985 up to the spring of 2010. In most instances, the scientific evidence is insufficient for the questions raised in the review. Concentrates of coagulation factors have good haemostatic effects on acute bleeding and surgical intervention in haemophilia A and B and VWD, but conclusions cannot be drawn about possible differences in the effects of different dosing strategies for acute bleeding and surgery. Prophylaxis initiated at a young age can prevent future joint damage in persons with haemophilia. The available treatment options for inhibitors have been insufficiently assessed. The economic consequences of various treatment regimens have been insufficiently analysed. Introduction of national and international registries is important.

Recruitment of sympatric vendace (Coregonus albula) and whitefish (C. lavaretus) is affected by different environmental factors	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Vendace and whitefish in Lake Osensjoen (boreal south-east Norway) were studied by means of gillnet test fishing (1976-2013) and hydro acoustic acquisition (1986-2011). Vendace increased in number between 1998 and 2009 while growth and size at maturity decreased. The relative density of whitefish decreased in the pelagic habitat, whereas growth and size remained the same. Both species exhibited varying year-class strength. Whereas strong year-classes of both species became less frequent after 1980 than before this, this seemed to change after 2000, especially for vendace. Generalised additive models suggested a strong positive relationship between July/August mean air temperature and year-class strength of both vendace and whitefish. Whitefish recruitment was also negatively affected by the new regulation regime implemented since 1981, and positively correlated with water level after hatching and by late ice off. The reason for the diverging impacts of environmental factors on the two species may be that vendace spawn in deeper waters that whitefish do. The results indicate that increasing summer temperatures benefit recruitment of both species, whereas low water level and early ice off will harm whitefish recruitment. Both trends are caused by climate warming. It may be speculated that increased density of the specialised plankton feeding vendace may affect the algal community through increased predation on herbivorous zooplankton and potentially affect the trophic state of the lake.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2016	25	4					652	663		10.1111/eff.12243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12243													WOS:000388307300014
J	Krivtsov, V; Bellinger, EG; Sigee, DC				Krivtsov, V; Bellinger, EG; Sigee, DC			Elemental composition of Microcystis aeruginosa under conditions of lake nutrient depletion	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Electron probe X-ray microanalysis (XRMA) was used to determine the elemental composition of the blue-green alga, Microcystis aeruginosa, in a stratified freshwater lake during the late summer. Colonies of this alga were initially observed in mid-July, at a time when phosphorus concentration in the lake water had decreased to minimal levels (total P 0.04 mg l(-1)). The P quota of these cells was high (mean concentration 132 mmol kg(-1) dry weight) with a cell P to lake water P concentration ratio of 10(5). The elemental concentrations of Microcystis remained relatively stable throughout the sampling period (July-September), with mean cell concentrations of Mg, P, S and Ca showing no significant changes. Mean elemental ratios and the ratio of monovalent/divalent cations were also relatively constant (SE < 10% mean). The pattern of cell elemental associations, determined by Factor and Pearson correlation analysis, was consistent throughout - with Mg, P, K and S forming a core tetrad of inter-correlated elements. The relative constancy of cell composition seen in Microcystis would be expected of an alga with a K-selection strategy. The continued high P quota over a period of nutrient depletion in lake water is consistent with the ability of this alga to sink to nutrient-rich lower regions of the water column.

Italy) is famous for its past bright red summer blooms of the dinoflagellate Glenodinium sanguineum Marchesoni. In 1938 and 1941 Baldi studied the lake and bloom phenomenon in detail. In particular, he found that the dinoflagellate showed high morphological plasticity and that it was present in the whole lake, but concentrated in the Red Bay, where it exhibited an active vertical migration. In 2001 the presence of G. sanguineum in the whole lake, with higher densities in the Red Bay could be confirmed. However the cell densities found in the Red Bay are up to 103 lower than those reported by Baldi. During two diurnal studies in August 2001 almost identical diurnal depth variations of maximum density of G. sanguineum were found, likely to be related to positive phototaxis. Although in the Red Bay the patterns of vertical variations were less clear, potential influential factors (wind, sun, temperature) are analysed and discussed. Dinoflagellate species composition from this and earlier studies show an increase in the number of taxa recorded from the lake in recent years and a shift in species composition possibly related to changes in the trophic status of the lake.

J	Cortinas, J Jr				Cortinas, J Jr			A climatology of freezing rain in the Great Lakes region of North America	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A 15-yr climatology of freezing rain surrounding the Great Lakes region of North America has been constructed using data from rawinsondes, surface stations, and gridded reanalyses from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. This climatology reveals that there is a general increase in the freezing-rain frequency from west to east; however, the distribution shows large spatial and temporal variability. Most freezing-rain events are short lived and occur near sunrise between the months of December and March. Continuous freezing rain typically lasts less than 1 h, with 7% of events lasting longer than 5 h. Most freezing rain is associated with extratropical cyclones, occurring northeast of the cyclone center in the presence of midlevel upward vertical motion, and air that is nearly saturated at low and midlevels, subfreezing near the surface, and warm (>0 degreesC) at low levels (approximate to 850 hPa). The location of the mean extratropical cyclone track during freezing-rain events in the Great Lakes region east of 87 degreesW and the climatological cyclone track during January partially explains the eastward increase in freezing-rain frequency. Additionally, it appears that the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean to the area east of 81 degreesW provides a large moisture source for these events, while western events appear to receive moisture from the distant Gulf of Mexico. The Great Lakes appear to have some effect on reducing the occurrence of freezing rain very near the western shores.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				OCT	2000	128	10					3574	3588		10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129<3574:ACOFRI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129<3574:ACOFRI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000090040300012

The quantified patterns of urban growth and land-use change are based on the processing and analysis of Landsat satellite images (MSS, TM, and OLI sensors) and are enhanced by observation- and interview-based information obtained in the field. The growth of Phnom Penh is shown to have encroached initially on the fertile agricultural lands of the Mekong River floodplain, but since 2006 the city has been sprawling predominantly over natural lakes and wetlands that until then were functional components of the urban mosaic and underpinned the livelihoods of its population. Urban land areas increased from 3000 ha in 1973 to 4000 ha in 1990, subsequently soaring to 25,000 ha in 2015, i.e. an average annual increase of 850-1000 ha. The discussion of these changes focuses on (i) changing livelihoods on the urban fringe; (ii) the numerous, and sometimes large, real-estate projects that have sprung up around the city centre on former wetland areas and are funded by strongly imbricated capital interests between the nation's elites and foreign investors; (iii) a comparison of the urban growth figures with other Asian cities; and (iv) current land policies in Cambodia. The results call for urgent policymaking to address the diseconomies that arise from the impending loss of ecosystem services; from the accentuation of flood hazards caused by the rapid, ongoing suppression of wetland habitats at the delta head of the eighth largest river in the world; and from the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of urban growth among the metropolitan population.

Diary of a bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus):: daily δ13C and δ18O records in otoliths by ion microprobe	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Otoliths provide information about an individual fish's environment at ecologically relevant time scales. We used ion microprobe analysis to produce high-resolution delta C-13 and delta O-18 time series from two age-4 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) otoliths, which provided insight into fish behavior and otolith fractionation processes. Scanning electron microscope images revealed delta C-13 and delta O-18 pit diameters of 10 and 15 mu m, respectively, corresponding to 1-5 and 29 daily increments during rapid otolith growth and 6-9 and 12-25 increments near annual otolith growth checks. Spot-to-spot reproducibility (1 SD) of the calcite standards was <0.2 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and <0.4 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and was small enough to resolve a change in a fish's ambient temperature of approximately 1 degrees C. A whole-take C-13 addition experiment elevated the delta C-13 of the lake's dissolved inorganic carbon for 56 days during the summer of 2005. Mixing model results indicated that the proportion of dietary carbon in otoliths (M) was similar for both fish (BLG-3, M = 0.45; BLG-12, M = 0.35), but the relation between M and proxies of metabolic rate differed between fish. Otolith stable isotope analysis by ion microprobe can reveal the environmental history of an individual fish and contribute to our understanding of processes that influence isotope ratio fractionation in otoliths.

Results of 18 of the whole-rock analyses fall on an isochron with an age of 2.677 +/- 0.057 Ga and Sr-i = 0.70080. Biotite model ages range from 2.50 to 1.93 Ga in a general spatial relationship of decreasing age with depth in the structural section as calibrated with the igneous hornblende barometer for tonalitic rocks and garnet-pyroxene barometers for granulites. Near the Michipicoten belt in the west, biotite ages of similar to 2 Ga reflect disturbances also recorded by paleomagnetic and whole-rock Rb-Sr systems. To the east, in a 70 km long northwest-southeast transect toward the Ivanhoe Lake fault zone, ages decrease from 2.50 to 1.95 Ga. In a southern transect ages are in the range 2.30-2.38 Ga to within 15 km of the fault, reflecting consistent erosion levels corresponding to similar to 0.53 MPa, but decrease to 1.93 Ga to the east, in concert with paleopressures in the 0.7-1.0 GPa range. A plateau of low Rb-Sr biotite dates is not evident, suggesting that the Kapuskasing uplift event exposed a frozen-in cooling profile, rather than setting the Rb-Sr clock by rapid cooling of the rocks from above their closure temperature. The youngest biotite date of 1.93 Ga therefore provides a maximum age for uplift, consistent with paleomagnetic data from Archean rocks and Early Proterozoic dykes, but in conflict with some K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar biotite age data.

We analysed five sites to fill this gap and used terrestrial plant macrofossils to establish robust radiocarbon chronologies. Palynological records from Gorgo Tondo, Gorgo Lungo, Marcato Cixe, Urgo Pietra Giordano and Gorgo Pollicino show that under natural or near natural conditions, deciduous forests (Quercus pubescens, Q. cerris, Fraxinus ornus, Ulmus), that included a substantial portion of evergreen broadleaved species (Q. suber, Q. ilex, Hedera helix), prevailed in the upper meso-mediterranean belt. Mesophilous deciduous and evergreen broadleaved trees (Fagus sylvatica, Ilex aquifolium) dominated in the natural or quasi-natural forests of the oro-mediterranean belt. Forests were repeatedly opened for agricultural purposes. Fire activity was closely associated with farming, providing evidence that burning was a primary land use tool since Neolithic times. Land use and fire activity intensified during the Early Neolithic at 5000 BC, at the onset of the Bronze Age at 2500 BC and at the onset of the Iron Age at 800 BC. Our data and previous studies suggest that the large majority of open land communities in Sicily, from the coastal lowlands to the mountain areas below the thorny-cushion Astragalus belt (ca. 1,800 m a.s.l.), would rapidly develop into forests if land use ceased. Mesophilous Fagus-Ilex forests developed under warm mid Holocene conditions and were resilient to the combined impacts of humans and climate. The past ecology suggests a resilience of these summer-drought adapted communities to climate warming of about 2 degrees C. Hence, they may be particularly suited to provide heat and drought-adapted Fagus sylvatica ecotypes for maintaining drought-sensitive Central European beech forests under global warming conditions.

Like many such shales, the Woodford sits atop an unconformity on the surface of underlying carbonate rocks (mainly the Hunton Group in this case). There is variable topographic relief on the unconformity surface due to incised valleys, cave collapse, and/or karst formation during periods of subaerial exposure resulting from eustatic sea-level fluctuations. Anomalously high thicknesses of the Woodford, with relatively high total organic carbon (TOC), can form within topographic depressions on the unconformity surface, giving rise to potential "sweet spots" as drilling targets. It is likely that the topographic relief that formed during subaerial exposure created areas of restricted marine circulation (or possibly hypersaline lakes) during an early fall in the sea level, and thus, localized anoxic depositional environments conducive to preservation of organic matter (TOC). Seismic analysis, calibrated with well logs and cuttings, of two areas on the Cherokee Platform in Oklahoma were completed to test the discontinuous and isolated distribution, vertically and horizontally, of the TOC. In one area, the TOC ranged up to 10 wt.% and in the other area, up to 13 wt.%. Seismic inversion and attribute analysis demonstrated the patchy distribution of the TOC vertically and laterally in both areas. These patchy, discontinuous distribution spotlights areas where TOC was preserved (in the minibasins), and point to potential sweet-spot locations. The delineation of organic-rich sweet spots was accomplished by integrating geologic, geochemical, and geophysical data in probabilistic neural networks obtaining seismic impedance-derived TOC that was mapped across different locations in the Cherokee Platform.																			2324-8858	2324-8866				FEB	2017	5	1					T33	T47		10.1190/INT-2015-0151.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/INT-2015-0151.1													WOS:000397196600004

Eemian and Late Glacial/Holocene palaeoenvironmental records from permafrost sequences at the Dmitry Laptev Strait (NE Siberia, Russia)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Terrestrial permafrost sections from the southern and northern coasts of Dmitry Laptev Strait have preserved records of landscape transition from glacial to interglacial periods. They allow geomorphologic and environmental changes to be traced from pre-Eemian time to the Eemian, and from the Late Glacial to the Holocene. The transition from one period to another induced extensive thawing of permafrost (thermokarst). Evolving thermokarst depressions transformed formerly frozen ground into taberal (unfrozen) deposits with accumulating overlying lacustrine deposits. Lacustrine horizons rich in palaeontological remains retain evidence of changes in environmental conditions. The pollen records reflect changes from grass-sedge dominated vegetation during the Early Eemian to shrub dominated spectra during the Middle Eemian thermal optimum followed by Late Eemian grass-sedge dominated tundra vegetation. Abundant Larix pollen have been found in Middle Eemian deposits from the south coast of the Dmitry Laptev Strait (Oyogos Yar), but are absent in similar deposits from the north coast (Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island), likely indicating that the northern tree line was located near the Oyogos Yar region during the Eemian thermal optimum. Grass-sedge dominated tundra vegetation occurred during the Late Glacial/Holocene transition which was replaced by shrub tundra during the early Holocene. Rich fossil ostracod records from Eemian and Late Glacial/Holocene lacustrine deposits could be correlated with the Eemian thermal optimum and the Late Glacial Allerod warm period. For both periods, the stable oxygen isotope data from the fossil ostracods suggest an approximate mean summer water temperature range between about 10 and 19 degrees C in the palaeo-lakes.

J	Mann, DH; Heiser, PA; Finney, BP				Mann, DH; Heiser, PA; Finney, BP			Holocene history of the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes, northwestern Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Located just north of the Arctic Circle, the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes (GKSD) are an inland dune field that is closely surrounded by boreal forest. The history of the GKSD tells us about changes in aridity, a climatic parameter whose history is poorly understood at high latitudes. Vegetated dunes in several states of geomorphic preservation surround the active dune field today, evidencing a complex history of Holocene activity. Small lakes in the forest bordering the dunes accumulate wind-blown sand. We use C-14-dated, lake-sediment cores to reconstruct a continuous history of sand influx over the last 8000 yr. The validity of this record is supported by limiting ages obtained from stratigraphic sections within the dune field. The extent of the GKSD underwent a fluctuating shrinkage coincident with Neoglaciation. This downsizing trend was interrupted by periods of increased sand deposition into lakes occurring 4800-4200, 3300-2600, 1300-700, and 300-100 calendar years ago, Aridity in the Kobuk valley during the Holocene probably was controlled by the frequency of North Pacific storms entering the region in late summer. Our results describe the first continuous history of changing moisture balance for central Beringia during the Holocene and comprise a baseline against which future records of climatic and ecological change in this region can be compared.

Improving the spatial and temporal monitoring of cyanotoxins in Iowa lakes using a multiscale and multi-modal monitoring approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are pervasive and negatively impact lake water quality, resulting in economic losses and public health risks through exposure to cyanotoxins. Therefore, it is critical to better monitor and understand the complexity of CyanoHABs, but current methods do not fully describe the spatial and temporal variability of bloom events. In this work, we developed a framework for a multiscale and multimodal monitoring approach for CyanoHABs combining drone-based near-range remote sensing with analytical measurements of microcystin cyanotoxins and chlorophyll-a. We analyzed weekly beach monitoring samples from 37 lakes geographically distributed across the state of Iowa (USA) over a 15-week period in the summer of 2019 to quantify ELISA (bioassay), 12 microcystin congeners (LC-MS/MS), and chlorophyll-a. We developed a novel microcystin congener-normalized equivalent toxin metric to compare CyanoHAB impacted waters; this microcystin-LR normalized sum-of-congeners approach yields lower predicted toxicity than parallel ELISA results suggesting ELISA is conservative for assessment. A significant linear relationship existed between chlorophyll-a and microcystin for lakes throughout Iowa (R-2 = 0.39, p < 0.001); lakes with low watershed: lake area ratio and long residence times exhibited a stronger correlation. We then developed a novel geometry-based image processing approach to allow for stitching over-water drone images, a previous barrier in photogrammetry. We applied our mutli-modal framework to a case study on Green Valley Lake to assess initial viability and predicted microcystin concentrations within 33%. We concluded that multispectral imaging is possible but may presently be insufficient for predicting microcystin concentrations due to limitations in the spectral capabilities of the multispectral camera, but technologies are quickly advancing, and lightweight hyperspectral imaging could soon become feasible for investigating spatial bloom variability on lakes.

SUSTAINABILITY												Small-scale inland fisheries (SSIF) are a livelihood opportunity for millions of people in developing countries. Understanding the economic, ecological, political and social impacts fishers are coping with can clarify weaknesses and challenges in the fishery management. Using the SSIF at Lake Alaotra, Madagascar, as an example, we analyzed the development and fishers' perception of, and adaptation strategies to, change. We surveyed fish catches to assess the state of fish stocks and conducted interviews to understand fishers' livelihood, problems, behavior and attitudes. Our results show that the fishery sector of Lake Alaotra has grown dramatically although fish catches have fallen sharply. Changes in species composition and low reproduction rates reflect the fishing pressure. A point of no return seems near, as decreasing agricultural yields force farmers to enter the fishery sector as a form of livelihood diversification. Lake Alaotra reflects an alarming trend which can already be seen in many regions of the world and may affect a growing number in the near future. The Alaotran fisheries demonstrate that SSIF's ability to provide livelihood alternatives under conditions of insecurity will become increasingly important. It further highlights that the identification of ongoing livelihood dynamics in order to disclose possible poverty trap mechanisms and to understand fisheries' current function is essential for sustainable management.																				2071-1050				SEP	2020	12	18							7299	10.3390/su12187299	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187299													WOS:000584274400001
J	Fallahi, E				Fallahi, Esmaeil			Horticulture in Iran Can Be an Alternative to Petroleum and a Major Source of International Business with Unique Potential and Challenges	HORTSCIENCE												The art and science of horticulture and horticultural crops are integral parts of Iranian's rich and ancient culture and modern economy. Many deciduous fruit, flowers, and vegetables are native to Iran (Persia), and from there, they were distributed to the rest of the world through the Silk Road established by the Achaemenid, the Royal Pars Dynasty. Variations in climate and presence of numerous mountains, lakes, rivers, and natural springs have created a unique country capable of producing all types of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Apples and other deciduous fruits are commercially produced in mountain ranges of Alborz and Zagrous and in many central provinces of Iran. The Caspian Sea area in the north of Iran is one of the most unique regions in the world where mild Mediterranean climate meshed with the adjacent Alborz mountain ranges has created a home to numerous species of edible horticultural plants, ranging from tea to cherries and pomegranates. Pistachio, olive, citrus, banana, and date are produced in Kerman, Fars, and Khuzestan regions. However, the Iranian horticultural industry faces many challenges, including global and regional political issues. Although some attempt has been made to preserve invaluable germplasm, a large number of native fruits, vegetables, and flowers are becoming extinct. Postharvest transportation and storage of horticultural crops is one of the most important issues facing Iranian horticulture. The future of horticulture in Iran can potentially be bright, and horticultural products have the potential to replace the oil income after reserves disappear, particularly if peace prevails in the region.																			0018-5345	2327-9834				SEP	2017	52	9					1145	1147		10.21273/HORTSCI12080-17	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI12080-17													WOS:000413021400003

Water level was calculated with the use of a regional adaptive retracking algorithm for the lakes II'men, Ladoga, Onega and Peipus. Applications of this algorithm considerably increase the quantity of actual data records and significantly improve the accuracy of water level evaluation. According to the results, temporal variability of Lake Ilmen, Lake Ladoga and Lake Piepus levels is characterized by a wave with a period of 4-5 years, and that of Lake Onega level is characterized by a wave with a period of 15 years. During the period from 1993 to 2011, lake level rose at a rate of 1.17 +/- 0.95 cm/year for Lake II'men, 0.24 +/- 0.10 cm/year for Lake Ladoga, 1.39 +/- 0.18 cm/year for Lake Piepus and 0.18 +/- 0.09 cm/year for Lake Onega.

Short-term impacts of Phragmites management on nutrient budgets and plant communities in Great Lakes coastal freshwater marshes	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Invasive plant management is a key focus of wetland managers, and considerable resources have been devoted to control of non-native Phragmites australis in many Great Lakes coastal wetlands. This study examined short-term (1-year) impacts of herbicide management by comparing wetland plant productivity, nutrient availability, and plant communities before and after herbicide treatment in two coastal wetlands. We also monitored a third wetland in years 3-5 following herbicide treatment. After herbicide treatment, annual aboveground net primary production and plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake decreased dramatically (by an average of 88%, 80% and 89% respectively; p<0.05); porewater soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and surface water ammonium increased at one site (p<0.05), while porewater ammonium increased at the other site (p<0.05); porewater dissolved organic carbon concentrations increased at both sites (p<0.05); and porewater nitrate did not change at either site. Despite large reductions in Phragmites biomass following herbicide treatment, floristic quality did not improve. When scaled to the area surrounding Lake Erie's Western Basin treated with herbicide in 2012, the reduction in plant nutrient uptake accounted for 24x10(3) kg of phosphorus and 159x10(3) kg of nitrogen, nutrients potentially available for export to coastal waters. This amount was small relative to average annual (2009-2014) loading from the Maumee River, but similar in magnitude to summer loading in 2012 (57% of total nitrogen and 478% of SRP riverine loading), a year of low discharge and loading. Our results highlight the trade-offs inherent in managing invasive plants.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2019	27	1					55	74		10.1007/s11273-018-9643-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-018-9643-6													WOS:000461362800004

The influence of flow-through saline gravel pit lakes on the hydrologic budget and hydrochemistry of a Mediterranean drainage basin	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Flow-through brackish gravel pit lakes near the Adriatic Coast of Emilia Romagna (Italy) in the Mediterranean have a large influence on the hydrologic budget of the watershed. Strong evaporation in combination with intense drainage of the low lying basins enhances groundwater inflow into the lake. Precipitation falling on the lakes is mixed with brackish/saline lake water causing the loss of freshwater. The gravel pit lakes are characterized by a high salinity (TDS=4.6-12.3 g L-1) and high pH (8.5). Stable isotope data show that gravel pit lake water is fed by groundwater which is a mix of Apennine River water and (Holocene) Adriatic Seawater, subsequently enriched by evaporation. The slope of the local evaporation line is 5.4. Conservative tracer and water budget modeling shows that the final Cl concentration depends strongly on the ratio of evaporation to total inflow. Increasing drainage to compensate for sea level rise, subsidence or intense precipitation would enhance ground water flow into the lake and decrease Cl concentration while increasing evaporation would increase Cl concentration. Groundwater rich in dissolved trace elements flows into the gravel pit lakes that contains water with a higher pH and dissolved oxygen. Pit lake water remains enriched in some elements (e.g., Ba, Mo, Sb) and depleted in others (e.g., Fe, Ca, Zn, SO4) with respect to groundwater composition. The gravel pit lakes show limited eutrophication but the water quality should be monitored for trace elements (e.g., As) if they are to be used for recreational purposes.					; GREGGIO, NICOLAS/K-1019-2016; dinelli, enrico/G-6532-2012	Mollema, Pauline Nella/0000-0003-2583-4944; GREGGIO, NICOLAS/0000-0002-7323-134X; dinelli, enrico/0000-0002-3870-544X													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2015	60	6					2009	2025		10.1002/lno.10147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10147													WOS:000363888400011

PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS ON THE SUBMERGED PLANT POTAMOGETON CRISPUS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Water level fluctuations in lakes are a fundamental feature of wetland hydrology, influencing the growth and development of wetland plants, species composition, and community succession. To study the effects of different water level fluctuations on the morphology and physiological characteristics of the submerged plant Potamogeton crispus. Experiments were conducted to investigate how varying intensities and durations of rising and falling water levels influence the growth and physiology of Potamogeton crispus. We analyzed the changes in the physiological indicators of the plant, such as antioxidant enzyme activity (peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase), osmoregulatory substances (soluble sugars, soluble proteins), superoxide anion and malondialdehyde under different water-level conditions. The results showed that water level fluctuations lead to higher malondialdehyde and superoxide anion contents, which cause damage to the plant, while the plant responds to unfavorable environments by adjusting the activities of antioxidant enzymes as well as the content of osmoregulatory substances. The antioxidant system of Potamogeton crispus was limited by the duration and intensity of water level fluctuation. And in the later stages of the experiment, the scavenging capacity of reactive oxygen species in the plant was reduced and malondialdehyde content increased.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2025	23	2					2441	2453		10.15666/aeer/2302_24412453	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2302_24412453		DEC 2024											WOS:001435869700001

Thermal regimes and effusive trends at Nyamuragira volcano (DRC) from MODIS infrared data	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Nyamuragira volcano is one of the most active African volcanoes. Eruptions have been occurring every 34 years throughout the last century. Here, we analyse satellite infrared data, collected by MODIS sensor to estimate the volcanic radiative power (VRP, in W) and energy (VRE; in J) released during the 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006-2007, 2010 and 2011-2012 eruptions. Based on the statistical distribution of VRP measurements, we found that thermal emissions at Nyamuragira fall into three distinct radiating regimes. The high-radiating regime occurs during the emplacement of poorly insulated lava flows and characterise most of the effusive activity. The moderate-radiating regime is associated with open-vent activity (Strombolian explosions and/or lava lake activity) eventually accompanied by the emplacement of short-lived and well-insulated flows. A third radiating regime (low-radiating regime) occurs during periods, which may last weeks to months, that follow each eruption and are associated with the cooling of the effused lava flows. By applying the radiant density approach to MODIS-derived VRP we also estimated the time-averaged lava discharge rates (TADR; in m(3) s(-1)) and we analysed the effusive trends of the above eruptions. We found that the transition between the effusive and open-vent activity typically takes place when TADR reduces to low values (<5 m(3) s(-1)) and marks a change in the eruptive style of the volcano. Finally, we observed a clear correlation between the volume of erupted lava and its cooling time. This suggests that the average thickness of the analysed lava flows is more variable than previously thought and sheds light on the uncertainty in calculating erupted volumes assuming that lava flow areas have uniform thickness.

A late Quaternary paleotemperature record from Hanging Lake, northern Yukon Territory, eastern Beringia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The late Quaternary paleoclimate of eastern Beringia has primarily been studied by drawing qualitative inferences from vegetation shifts. To quantitatively reconstruct summer temperatures, we analyzed lake sediments for fossil chironomids, and additionally we analyzed the sediments for fossil pollen and organic carbon content. A comparison with the delta O-18 record from Greenland indicates that the general climatic development of the region throughout the last glaciation-Holocene transition differed from that of the North Atlantic region. Between similar to 17 and 15 ka, mean July air temperature was on average 5 degrees C colder than modern, albeit a period of near-modern temperature at similar to 16.5 ka. Total pollen accumulation rates ranged between similar to 180 and 1200 grains cm(-2) yr(-1). At similar to 15 ka, approximately coeval with the Bolling interstadial, temperatures again reached modern values. At similar to 14 ka, nearly 1000 yr after warming began, Betula pollen percentages increased substantially and mark the transition to shrub-dominated pollen contributors. Chironomid-based inferences suggest no evidence of the Younger Dryas stade and only subtle evidence of an early Holocene thermal maximum, as temperatures from similar to 15 ka to the late Holocene were relatively stable. The most recognizable climatic oscillation of the Holocene occurred from similar to 4.5 to 2 ka. (C) 2009 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Higher demand in the summer months combined with compounding supply shocks in several power generation technologies can potentially cause a "perfect storm" leading to failure of the power system. Potential future climate stress must be incorporated in investment decisions and energy system planning and operation. We assess how projected future climate impacts on the power system would affect alternative pathways for the electricity sector considering a broad range of generation technologies and changes in demand. We calculate a "potential supply gap" metric for each pathway, system component, and sub-region of the US Heartland due to climate-induced effects on electricity demand and power generation. Potential supply gaps range from 5% in the North Central region under mild changes in climate to 21% in the Lakes-Mid Atlantic region under more severe climate change. We find increases in electricity demand to be more important in determining the size of the potential supply gap than stresses on power generation, while larger shares of renewables in the power system contribute to lower supply gaps. Our results provide a first step toward considering systemic climate impacts that may require changes in managing the grid or on potential additional capacity/reserves that may be needed.					; Gurgel, Angelo/D-9446-2013	Yuan, Mei/0000-0001-5654-8698; Gurgel, Angelo/0000-0001-8331-9508; Schlosser, Adam/0000-0002-3205-0542; Tapia-Ahumada, Karen/0000-0002-8782-6993													1381-2386	1573-1596				APR	2024	29	4							27	10.1007/s11027-024-10119-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-024-10119-3													WOS:001186251200001

Waterfowl and Lunate Crescents in Western North America: The Archaeology of the Pacific Flyway	JOURNAL OF WORLD PREHISTORY												California and Great Basin archaeologists have long discussed and debated the function of chipped stone crescents found in Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene sites in the Far West of North America. Because they are found over a vast area, in sites occupied over a period spanning at least 4,000 years (similar to 12,000-8,000 cal BP), it may be that crescents were used for a variety of purposes. Here we focus on lunate crescents and their strong association with wetland localities (lakes, marshes, estuaries, and islands). We reconsider whether crescents could have been used as transverse projectile points to hunt waterfowl. We also assess the biogeographical legacies of migrating birds to propose that as many as four species of large anatids (tundra swan, greater white-fronted goose, snow goose, Ross's goose) that now breed in the Canadian High Arctic once bred in the Great Basin and adjacent regions during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. We propose that crescents were used primarily in the taking or processing of geese and swans, some of which may have bred and molted in what are now temperate latitudes. After the Laurentide ice sheet retreated, these four species established High Arctic breeding grounds and no longer bred in the Great Basin. In this scenario, the absence of some populations of molting geese and swans helps explain why crescents fell out of the archaeological record after similar to 8,000 cal. BP. When crescents were used, Native Americans in the Far West may have had access to millions of large waterfowl.					; Erlandson, Jon/ITV-0032-2023	Erlandson, Jon/0000-0002-4705-4319; 													0892-7537	1573-7802				SEP	2013	26	3					173	211		10.1007/s10963-013-9066-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10963-013-9066-5													WOS:000328071200001

However, since almost all of the methods for estimating ISA have been developed for urban environments, it is questionable whether these methods can be successfully applied to drainage basins, such as those found in Japan, which usually have more complicated vegetation components (e.g. paddy field, plowed field and dense forest). This paper presents a pre-screened and normalized multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (PNMESMA) method, which includes a new endmember selection strategy and an integration of the normalized spectral mixture analysis (NSMA) and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), for estimating the ISA fraction in Lake Kasumigaura Basin, Japan. This new proposed method is superior to the previous methods in that the estimation error of the proposed method is much smaller than the previous SMA- or NSMA-based methods for drainage basin environments. The overall root mean square error was reduced to 5.2%, and no obvious underestimation or overestimation occurred for high or low ISA areas. Through the assessment of environmental quality in Lake Kasumigaura Basin using the ISA fraction, the results showed that the basin has been in the impacted category since 1987, and that in the two decades since, the environmental quality has continued to decline. If this decline continues, then Lake Kasumigaura Basin will fall into the degraded category by 2017. (C) 2010 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

Species of this genus strongly inhibit the establishment and growth of tree species, especially those of the genus Nothofagus. At intervals of many years, this bamboo flowers synchronously and dies, creating large-scale disturbances. The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of bamboo dieback on tree regeneration, especially of shade-intolerant species. The forest studied is a remnant stand of old-growth forest dominated by emergent individuals of N. obliqua and Eucryphia cordifolia which project about 10 m above a main canopy formed by Aextoxicon punctatum, Laurelia philippiana, and Podocarpus saligna. Tree seedlings that established prior to bamboo dieback were recorded in six gaps densely covered by bamboo. After the dieback event in the early 1990's, recruitment, height growth and survivorship were monitored in four gaps during two growing seasons. After the synchronous mass flowering and death of Chusquea quila, both reorganization of advance regeneration and new seedling recruitment were observed in gaps. The advance regeneration consisted mainly of the shade-tolerant species A. punctatum, L. philippiana, and Amomyrtus luma. These species together with E. cordifolia accounted for over 90% of the total individuals in gaps. During the following two seasons, c. 40% of the advance regeneration either died or was damaged. Root suckers of E. cordifolia and L. philippiana were taller and grew faster than the seedlings of other species. Nothofagus obliqua was unable to establish advance regeneration in gaps formerly dominated by bamboo. New recruitment resulted in the synchronized establishment of tree seedlings, especially less shade-tolerant species such as N. obliqua, Aristotelia chilensis, Rhaphithamnus spinosus, and E. cordifolia. These species recruited into the gaps almost entirely during the first season right after the bamboo dieback. However, by the end of the second season, these species had a lower density due to a combination of lower recruitment rate, shortened recruitment period, and greater mortality rate compared to the shade-tolerant species. New bamboo seedlings grew faster and were more abundant than tree seedlings, except for root suckers (both new establishment and advance regeneration) of E. cordifolia which is more likely to successfully recruit into the canopy. Seedlings of N. obliqua compete poorly with bamboo seedlings; its successful recruitment may require bamboo flowering coincident with a mast seed year for the tree species.					; González, Mauro/AAH-7569-2019; Veblen, Thomas/U-6461-2018	Gonzalez, Mauro/0000-0002-4333-724X; 													1385-0237					JUL	2002	161	1					59	73		10.1023/A:1020378822847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020378822847													WOS:000178213000004

Water column nutrient processing rates in rivermouths of Green Bay (Lake Michigan)	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Understanding the quantity and form of nutrient loads to large lakes is necessary to understand controls over primary production, phytoplankton community composition and the production of phytotoxins. Nutrient loading estimates to large lakes are primarily made at stream gages that are deliberately placed outside the direct influence of lake processes, but these estimates cannot take into account processes that occur in the biologically active river-to-lake transition zone. These transition zones (rivermouths) sometimes alter nutrient concentrations and ratios substantially, but few studies have directly measured processing rates of nutrients within rivermouths. From April through September 2016, we conducted 23 water column incubation experiments to measure nutrient loss rates in four rivermouths. First order loss rates (K) for inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) indicated greater loss in light than in dark treatments, suggesting primary production increases N and P removal. Variability in K was high across both time and space, and the measured environmental parameters did not appear to be strongly associated with this variation in K for most N and P forms. If the measured K values and water residence times are accurate, then between 0 and 99% of the inorganic P and nitrates entering the rivermouth would be lost (i.e., converted to organic or particulate P). In late summer, Fox River discharge is low and residence times are usually long, which allow for much higher proportional nutrient removal in the water column. Water column processing appears to be capable of transforming large quantities of dissolved N and P to particulate forms and thus altering its transport and presumably its bioavailability.					; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Larson, James/0000-0002-6414-9758; Evans, Mary Anne/0000-0002-1627-7210; Bailey, Sean/0000-0003-0361-7914; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				JAN	2019	142	1					73	93		10.1007/s10533-018-0517-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0517-z													WOS:000454598000005

Sensitivity of plankton indices to lake trophic conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Herein, we report the response of indices based on phytoplankton and zooplankton and their combination to different nutrient concentrations in lakes. The study was carried out in ten lakes in northeastern Poland. Integrated samples were collected from the epilimnion during the summer of 2012-2013. Secchi disk visibility (SD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll a were used as proxies for eutrophication. We calculated 16 plankton indices: two phytoplankton indices, six crustacean indices, five rotiferan indices, two zooplankton diversity indices, and one combined phytoplankton and zooplankton index. Among them, nine indices with the strongest correlations with TP were selected: percentage share of Crustacean species indicative of high trophy in the indicative group's numbers (IHTCRU), percentage share of Rotifera species indicative of high trophy in the indicative group's numbers IHTROT, Crustacean ratio of biomass to numbers B/N-CRU, phytoplankton trophic index (TITP+TN), Margalef's index, percentage share of cyclopoid biomass in total biomass of Crustacea (CB), Rotifera numbers (N-ROT), biomass of Cyclopoida (B-CY), and ratio of the cyclopoid biomass to the biomass of Cladocera (CY/CL). The sensitivity of the normalized values of these indices to proxies of eutrophication was tested. IHTCRU, IHTROT, and B/N-CRU were the most sensitive and gave the strongest responses at lower TP concentrations (<35 mu g/L). The phytoplankton trophic index, TITP+TN, together with the zooplankton-based Margalef's index and CB were very sensitive in both low (<35 mu g/L) and high (>60 mu g/L) TP conditions. On the other hand, N-ROT, B-CY, and CY/CL were slightly sensitive at low TP concentrations while their reaction was notable at high TP concentrations. A similar pattern of response was observed for TN concentration and SD visibility.

Meteorological factors controlling soil gases and indoor CO2 concentration: A permanent risk in degassing areas	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Furnas volcano is one of the three quiescent central volcanoes of Sao Miguel island (Azores Archipelago, Portugal). Its present activity is marked by several degassing manifestations, including fumarolic fields, thermal and cold CO2 springs and soil diffuse degassing areas. One of the most important soil diffuse degassing areas extends below Furnas village, located inside the volcano caldera. A continuous gas geochemistry programme was started at Furnas volcano in October 2001 with the installation of a permanent Soil CO2 efflux station that has coupled meteorological sensors to measure barometric pressure, rain, air and soil temperature, air humidity, soil water content and wind speed and direction. Spike-like oscillations are observed on the Soil CO2 efflux time series and are correlated with low barometric pressure and heavy rainfall periods. Stepwise multiple regression analysis, applied to the time series obtained, verified that the meteorological variables explain 43.3% of the gas efflux variations. To assess the impact of these influences in inhabited zones a monitoring test was conducted in a Furnas village dwelling placed where Soil CO2 concentration is higher than 25 vol.% Indoor CO2 air concentration measurements at the floor level reached values as higher as 20.8 vol.% during stormy weather periods. A similar test was performed in another degassing area, Mosteiros village, located on the flank of Sete Cidades volcano (S. Miguel Island), showing the same kind of relation between indoor CO2 concentrations and barometric pressure. This work shows that meteorological conditions alone increase the gas exposure risk for populations living in degassing areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, progress has been hampered by a range of challenges. This paper delves into the environmental, technological, infrastructural, regulatory, and human factors that have constrained offshore wind development in the region. While some aspects of these challenges have been studied, there remains a significant need for a comprehensive review that surveys the available data, tools, and technical approaches. This paper aims to fill this gap by systematically analyzing and presenting the challenges, along with the technical approaches, resources, and potential solutions required to overcome them. Special attention is given to address the freshwater ice challenge, a complex and critical issue that has not been fully addressed in the existing literature. By synthesizing current research and available methodologies, this paper seeks to provide a valuable resource for stakeholders involved in offshore wind energy development in the Great Lakes. The outcomes are intended to highlight the essential tools and approaches needed to overcome the existing barriers and unlock the substantial offshore wind energy potential of the Great Lakes. Additionally, the technologies and methodologies reviewed in this paper can be applied to Arctic regions or other bodies of water experiencing similar weather conditions and water/ocean dynamics.																			1616-7341	1616-7228				MAR	2025	75	3							21	10.1007/s10236-025-01666-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-025-01666-7													WOS:001427664100001

Examples within the lake include the belt of Chara algae as well as the shell zone, both presumably impeding migrations of benthic invertebrates. Three potential cases of vertical differentiation leading to distinct depth forms have been reported for the gastropod subfamily Pyrgulinae (Caenogastropoda: Hydrobiidae): Ginaia munda ssp., Macedopyrgula spp. and Ochridopyrgula macedonica ssp. Based on DNA data of the COI gene from a total of 145 specimens, this article aims at investigating the vertical differentiation within these depth forms and thus patterns of speciation in Lake Ohrid. An initial morphometric analysis showed a clear correlation of shell shape and collecting depth for Ginaia munda ssp. and Macedopyrgula spp. This morphological trend is largely reflected in the genetic structure of the respective taxa. The data presented here indicate the existence of strong gradients of abiotic and biotic factors in Lake Ohrid rather than distinct barriers. Therefore, parapatric speciation may be the predominant form of differentiation of benthic invertebrates in the lake. Incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization and phenotypic plasticity possibly caused by epigenetic mechanisms are discussed as possible reasons for the incongruence between geno- and phenotype observed in few specimens of Ginaia munda ssp. and Macedopyrgula spp. For the third taxon, Ochridopyrgula macedonica ssp., morphometric and genetic analyses revealed only weak support for the previously proposed depth forms. However, a horizontal differentiation of lake and spring populations was revealed instead, and parapatric and allopatric differentiations are discussed in this taxon.					; Wilke, Thomas/G-1517-2012	Hauffe, Torsten/0000-0001-5711-9457; Wilke, Thomas/0000-0001-8263-7758													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2012	682	1					61	73		10.1007/s10750-011-0864-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0864-4													WOS:000299925600005

The Coupling between the global climate and ice sheet models is asynchronous, with a climate simulation performed once every 10000 years, and only for the first 40000 years. These global climate model solutions are re-used to perform runs of 400000 years in length, with orbital forcing and different levels of CO,. The sediment model includes bulk transport Under ice, generation of sub-ice till. and river transport, and predicts the continental-scale evolution of sediment thickness and coastal discharge. For the first few 10000's of years after the onset Of substantial ice (triggered by CO, falling below similar to3 X pre-industrial level), sediment discharge to the ocean is relatively uniform around the coast, derived from nearby pre-existing regolith. After that, most discharge is concentrated into similar to4 sites at the Months of major trough systems, with orbitally paced Pulses Oil 10(4)-yr scales. These sites and the average magnitudes Of the fluxes agree generally with those deduced from offshore seismic and core data, although longer (10 my) integrations Lire needed to model the real sediment evolution.

The Rocky Mountain Ridged Mussel (Gonidea angulata) is an at-risk species in Canada, with limited information on population age structure. Maximum age of the species was found to be 50 years, by counting winter annuli and validated by isotopic oxygen analysis. Employing a Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), results showed mussels from river habitat were predicted to have faster growth rates than mussels from lake habitats, highlighting the impact of local environmental conditions, including temperature variations, primary productivity, and water quality, on mussel growth dynamics. Of concern was the limited evidence of juvenile recruitment, with the majority of specimens potentially representing an ageing population. This pattern potentially signals an early warning of impending population decline. Our results underscore the necessity of monitoring age structure as a vital component of assessing population health of freshwater mussels and the importance of understanding local environmental conditions when determining age.

J	Braun, LM; Brucet, S; Mehner, T				Braun, Lisa-Marie; Brucet, Sandra; Mehner, Thomas			Top-down and bottom-up effects on zooplankton size distribution in a deep stratified lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Trophic interactions in the pelagic area of lakes and the opposing effects of fish feeding (top-down) and phytoplankton biomass (bottom-up) on zooplankton communities are central topics in limnology. We hypothesized that zooplankton size distributions should be a more sensitive approach to disentangle top-down and bottom-up effects than the commonly measured zooplankton biomass. We examined zooplankton size distributions from 148 samples collected during summer months in the upper and lower pelagic layers of a deep mesotrophic lake among 13 years of sampling. Top-down effects, namely fish size and biomass, and bottom-up effects, including water temperature and total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations, were considered. To add robustness to our analyses, we expressed the zooplankton size distributions as size spectra based on log-binning, as continuous size spectra and by the size diversity, a measure that has been developed to mimic taxonomic diversity indices. Among numerous regressions tested, significant top-down or bottom-up effects could rarely been detected. Our results indicate that the overall zooplankton size distribution was not significantly affected by fish predation and lake productivity measured as total phosphorus or chlorophyll a concentration. However, we found negative correlations between fish biomass and the preferred zooplankton prey, including Bosmina longirostris, Daphnia cucullata and nauplii in the upper depth layer. However, due to their small body size, low biomass and therefore relative small contribution to the zooplankton size distribution, predation on preferred zooplankton species did not translate into a statistically significant modification of the entire size spectrum. Consequently, the size spectrum seems to be relatively robust against predation effects, but might reflect the lake-wide energy availability and transfer efficiency in the food web.

The climate reconstruction, based on the Modern Analogue Technique, indicates warmer and drier conditions during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). MWP was preceded by a short-lived cold humid event around AD 1060, and followed by a rapid return around AD 1400 to cooler and wetter conditions which generally characterize the Little Ice Age (LIA). Around AD 1450 (solar Sporer minimum), the LIA attained a temperature minimum and a summer precipitation maximum. The solar Maunder minimum around AD 1690 corresponded at Joux to rather mild temperatures but maximal annual precipitation. These results generally agree with other records from neighbouring Alpine regions. However, there are differences in the timing of the LIA temperature minimum depending on the proxy and/or the method used for the reconstruction. As a working hypothesis, the hydrological signal associated with the MWP and LIA oscillations at Lake Joux may have been mainly driven by a shift around AD 1400 from positive to negative NAO modes in response to variations in solar irradiance possibly coupled with changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

Active cells were enumerated by fluorescence microscopy after treatment with the lac inducer IPTG and cytological assay for beta-galactosidase. In all experiments, active and total cell counts remained within a three-fold range of each other and their initial values, while culturability fell by >10(8)-fold and 10(3)-fold in chloramphenicol-treated and untreated preparations, respectively, Quantitative image analysis revealed different distributions of cell-specific fluorescence and indicated a progressive decline in the levels of induced enzyme activity in both E. coli and Salmonella enteritidis. It was concluded that the non-culturable cells studied retained inducible enzyme activity and that this activity did not result from a starvation-induced programme of gene expression. Whether or not such active but nonculturable cells are viable, they are clearly responsive and have the potential to influence their environment. The assay described can be applied to heterogeneous populations and environments and shows considerable potential for the study of gene expression at the single cell level.					; Harwood, Colin/AGF-0120-2022	Barer, Michael Richard/0000-0002-0377-3100; Harwood, Colin/0000-0002-3624-0001; 													0950-382X					AUG	1995	17	3					545	554		10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.mmi_17030545.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.mmi_17030545.x								8559073					WOS:A1995RV31400015

Paleoclimate records provide information about these variations, forming the basis of our understanding and modeling of them. Fossil pollen records are abundant in the NE US, but cannot simultaneously provide information about paleoclimate and past vegetation in a modeling context because this leads to circular logic. If pollen data are used to constrain past vegetation changes, then the remaining paleoclimate archives in the northeastern US (NE US) are quite limited. Nonetheless, a growing number of diverse reconstructions have been developed but have not yet been examined together. Here we conduct a systematic review, assessment, and comparison of paleotemperature and paleohydrological proxies from the NE US for the last 3000 years. Regional temperature reconstructions (primarily summer) show a long-term cooling trend (1000 BCE-1700 CE) consistent with hemispheric-scale reconstructions, while hydroclimate data show gradually wetter conditions through the present day. Multiple proxies suggest that a prolonged, widespread drought occurred between 550 and 750 CE. Dry conditions are also evident during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, which was warmer and drier than the Little Ice Age and drier than today. There is some evidence for an acceleration of the longer-term wetting trend in the NE US during the past century; coupled with an abrupt shift from decreasing to increasing temperatures in the past century, these changes could have wide-ranging implications for species distributions, ecosystem dynamics, and extreme weather events. More work is needed to gather paleoclimate data in the NE US to make inter-proxy comparisons and to improve estimates of uncertainty in reconstructions.					; Moore, David/A-6268-2013; Berke, Melissa/H-3819-2016; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; Yu, Zicheng/D-4108-2012; Nichols, Jonathan/B-4410-2011; Bartlein, Patrick/E-4643-2011; Trouet, Valerie/AAE-4888-2021; Umbanhowar, Charles/KFS-6011-2024; Booth, Robert/G-5563-2010; Williams, John/KBC-5275-2024; Cook, Edward/ABV-5232-2022	Berke, Melissa/0000-0003-4810-3773; Marsicek, Jeremiah/0000-0002-6444-5207; Goring, Simon/0000-0002-2700-4605; Moore, David JP/0000-0002-6462-3288; Nolan, Connor/0000-0002-2780-2041; Jackson, Stephen/0000-0002-1487-4652; Yu, Zicheng/0000-0003-2358-2712; Marlon, Jennifer/0000-0002-8299-9609; Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925; Clifford, Michael/0000-0002-1509-9280; Bartlein, Patrick/0000-0001-7657-5685; Booth, Robert/0000-0002-9264-4959; Trouet, Valerie/0000-0002-2683-8704; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				OCT 13	2017	13	10					1355	1379		10.5194/cp-13-1355-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-1355-2017													WOS:000412938700002
J	Hember, RA; Lafleur, PM; Cogley, JG				Hember, RA; Lafleur, PM; Cogley, JG			Synoptic controls on summer evapotranspiration from a bog peatland in southern Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The relationship between surface hydrometeorological variables and mid-tropospheric circulation was used to describe and model the synoptic controls on daily and monthly evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) measured above a peat bog near Ottawa, Ontario. The four most dominant modes of variability in daily 500 hPa geopotential height over eastern North America were defined by S-mode principal component analysis and subjected to K-means clustering in order to produce discrete patterns of 500 hPa height. A total of 10 clusters were retained, based on a compromise between the number of legitimate patterns defined in a separate manual classification scheme and the proportion of variance grouped between clusters (61%) by the K-means algorithm. Height patterns defined by the 10-cluster scheme exhibited differences in their control over bog ET. Pre-high anticyclonic conditions were most efficient at drying the bog, whereas conditions prior to and during the passage of cyclonic systems were the least efficient at drying the bog. The remaining seven clusters exhibited insignificant control over ET on a seasonal basis. Variability in heights directly over the study site, associated with the second principal component, exhibited the closest relationship with hydrometeorological fluxes at the bog surface. However, attempts to model daily ET based, first, on multiple linear regression using principal components and, second, on cluster analogues of ET produced unsatisfactory skill. The inability to forecast daily ET was attributed to the influence of non-linear variation in the rate at which mid-tropospheric circulation controls propagated down to the surface and also to unresolved hydrological controls at the bog surface. Days following rainfall frequently resulted in amplified ET, regardless of cluster type, indicating that the control of ET by antecedent moisture conditions was a limiting factor in downscaling ET from large-scale atmospheric predictors. On a monthly time scale, however, the circulation indices explained 64% and 45% of the variation in monthly ET and PET respectively.

J	Brinkmann, WAR				Brinkmann, WAR			Application of non-hierarchically clustered circulation components to surface weather conditions: Lake Superior basin winter temperatures	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												An S-mode principal component analysis was applied to the correlation and covariance matrices of a 700 hPa height window centered over eastern North America. The first five components were retained and rotated. K-means clustering algorithm was applied to the four solutions to generate 22 circulation types for each. Regression models were built, relating monthly mean temperature anomalies to monthly circulation type frequencies. The results were compared to those obtained in an earlier study using a correlation-based approach to classify the same data set. It was found that i) the amount of within-type variability is comparable for the two and that ii) the difference between cold and warm days of a circulation type is for both classification approaches an anomaly located to the east of the lake. A detailed analysis of this difference indicated that some information is contained in the scores for the first five principal components land could therefore be used to improve the regression results) but that some is contained in the higher order components and was thus lost. Differences in the PC scores between warm and cold days were used to divide the circulation types into warm and cold subtypes. This improved the regression results but the best results were still inferior to those that had been obtained with the correlation-based classification.																			0177-798X	1434-4483					1999	63	1-2					41	56		10.1007/s007040050090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s007040050090													WOS:000081427200004

Modeling the influence of snow cover on low Arctic net ecosystem exchange	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Arctic net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between the land surface and the atmosphere is influenced by the timing of snow onset and melt. The objective of this study was to examine whether uncertainty in model estimates of NEE could be reduced by representing the influence of snow on NEE using remote sensing observations of snow cover area (SCA). Observations of NEE and time-lapse images of SCA were collected over four locations at a low Arctic site (Daring Lake, NWT) in May-June 2010. Analysis of these observations indicated that SCA influences NEE, and that good agreement exists between SCA derived from time-lapse images, Landsat and MODIS. MODIS SCA was therefore incorporated into the vegetation photosynthesis respiration model (VPRM). VPRM was calibrated using observations collected in 2005 at Daring Lake. Estimates of NEE were then generated over Daring Lake and Ivotuk, Alaska (2004-2007) using VPRM formulations with and without explicit representations of the influence of SCA on respiration and/or photosynthesis. Model performance was assessed by comparing VPRM output against unfilled eddy covariance observations from Daring Lake and Ivotuk (2004-2007). The uncertainty in VPRM estimates of NEE was reduced when respiration was estimated as a function of air temperature when SCA <= 50% and as a function of soil temperature when SCA > 50%.					; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010	Humphreys, Elyn/0000-0002-5397-2802; Kelly, Richard/0000-0001-8076-7604; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X													1748-9326					JUL-SEP	2013	8	3							035045	10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/035045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/035045													WOS:000325247100090

Monitoring playa lake inundation in the western United States: Modern analogues to late-Holocene lake level change	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Closed basin playas are among the most sensitive hydrologic systems globally and are excellent indicators of current and past climatic variability. This variability can significantly impact hydrologic regimes and biotic communities, and is often expressed in lake-bed deposits and shoreline features. We analyzed two playa basins in western North America that lie to either side of the current divide between monsoon and westerly precipitation regimes. Using a 23-year sequence of Landsat images at a 16-day time step, we determined the playa inundation response to varying precipitation inputs. Our results show that a strongly contrasting lake-inundation response occurs in lake basins separated by only 200 km. The Animas/Lordsburg Basin shows a marked lake-area increase in response to winter precipitation events, while the more southerly Palomas Basin shows a stronger response to monsoonal and El Nino-type events. This sensitivity to different input sources over short distances may explain some of the apparent asynchronous behavior of playa response found in lake records. Comprehensive regional-scale inundation records could be used to understand the dynamics of playa inundation events and how these events are linked to atmospheric circulation, and possibly to understand the observed asynchronous behavior of lake basins during the late Pleistocene and Holocene.

Isolation basins in the coastal ice-free regions offer continuous sedimentary sequences to reconstruct marine-freshwater transitions and its environmental changes. In this study, we present the grain size (sand-silt-clay) and organic matter variations in a 51 cm radiocarbon-dated sediment core from Pup Lagoon, an isolation basin in Larsemann Hills (East Antarctica). The sediment core spans the last 6109 years and provides information on environmental changes in two different settings, i.e., (a) under the marine influence, and (b) as an isolated lake. Three cluster zones were identified viz., LZ1 (6109-2427 y BP: marine environment), LZ2 (2427-2101 y BP: transition zone) and LZ3 (2101-116 y BP: freshwater environment). Fine grain sediments (silt) are dominant in LZ1, indicating a strong hydrodynamic energy conditions affected by tidal currents with low organic matter. Higher sand content during the transition period (LZ2) indicates the strongest hydrodynamic condition and sediment deposition from sea ice. The increasing trend of OM (cyanobacterial benthic mat) beginning at similar to 2101 y BP suggests the isolation of the lake. The highest fine grained sediments (silt-clay) in LZ3 suggests lowered meltwater derived detritus in response to mild austral summer conditions during the Late Holocene.

Evaluating and quantifying changes in the ecosystem can help us better understand and develop hypotheses to explain the dynamics of the ecosystem. In this study, trophic interactions and community structure of commercial fisheries species of Lake Taihu ecosystem were analyzed and compared for three time periods (1961-1965, 1981-1987, and 1991-1995) using the Ecopath with Ecosim model with the aim of evaluating the changes in the population dynamics and ecosystem development mechanism spanning the period from the 1960s to 1990s. The results show that the biomass of large predators decreased over the three decades, while the biomass of small species increased. Increases in the P/B ratios and fishing mortality levels observed for species groups reveal rapidly intensifying fishery stress over the three decades. The fisheries operated at the highest trophic level during the 1980s, and there are some indications of "fishing down the food web" in this ecosystem between the 1980s and the 1990s. Drawing upon Odum's theory of ecosystem maturity, the structured, web-like ecosystem of the 1960s developed into a highly mature system during the 1980s; yet, in the 1990s, this structure became less complex and the system's maturity fell to its lowest observed level. During this period, the successional development of the system occurred in reverse.					; Li, Yalei/IQS-0680-2023	Chen, Liqiao/0000-0003-0138-7828; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2010	44	2					337	348		10.1007/s10452-009-9293-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9293-0													WOS:000277425000002

Therefore, the palaeoclimatic archives in the region are suitable for detecting past moisture changes. The study of Laguna Aculeo (33degrees50'S, 70degrees54'W) presents a multiproxy Holocene lake record including sedimentology, geochemistry, mineralogy, pollen, diatoms, and radiocarbon dating (17 dates). Results indicate an and early to mid-Holocene period (about 9500-5700 cal yr B.P.). After 5700 cal yr B.P. effective moisture increased progressively and, around 3200 cal yr B.P., modern humid conditions were established. Numerous intercalated elastic layers reflect flood deposition during rainy winters. A fluvial unit was deposited shortly before 9000 cal yr B.P. Subsequently, flood events were absent until 5700 but have become frequent since 3200 cal yr B.P. The frequency of flood layers possibly points to weak or no El Nino activity during the early and mid-Holocene, with a subsequent increase during the late Holocene. During the early and mid-Holocene, the Westerlies were probably blocked and hence deflected southward by the subtropical high-pressure cell. Higher precipitation during the last 3200 yr seems strongly related to a weakened subtropical high-pressure cell with intensified Westerlies and possibly increased El Nino activity.

J	HEUSSER, CJ				HEUSSER, CJ			LATE-GLACIAL HOLOCENE CLIMATE OF THE LAKE DISTRICT OF CHILE	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen evidence from a 350-cm section of a fen in a moraine belt Rucanancu bears on the controversy regarding interpretation of Late-Glacial and Holocene climate in midlatitude Chile. Earlier pollen studies, indicating a cooling trend between .apprx. 11,000-10,000 yr B.P., disagreed with observations of glacier fluctuations which show continuous glacier wastage and, by inference, warming after 12,500 yr B.P. and possibly earlier, up until Neoglaciation, beginning after 6850 yr B.P. Fossil beetle assemblage data in this time range support the interpretation of climate made from the observed glacier behavior. At Rucanancu, a pollen assemblage containing upper montane podocarp (Podocarpus andinus) in quantities reaching 34% and dating between 10,440-10,000 yr B.P. implies a cold climate with summer temperatures possibly 5.degree.-8.degree. C lower than today''s. Holocene warming began afterward, later than the glacier and beetle records indicate, and continued until at least 8350 yr B.P., as suggested by the sequence of assemblages dominated by Myrtaceae, by Aextoxicon punctatum and by Gramineae. A subsequent assemblage of Nothofagus obliqua type implies an increase of moisture until 6960 yr B.P., following which N. dombeyi type, under a cool and humid Neoglacial climate, became dominant.																			0033-5894	1096-0287					1984	22	1					77	90		10.1016/0033-5894(84)90008-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(84)90008-5													WOS:A1984TD76200007

C). The survival response after 19 days was described by response surface analysis. Salinities < 15.permill. were beyond the tolerance of the species. At higher salinities a thermal range of 10.degree.-32.degree. C was tolerated. The effect of a sudden temperature increase of 10.degree. C to stimulate power station output over the 19 day survival regime was described for exposure periods up to 114 h over 26 salinity-temperature combinations. The area of minimum mortality shifted toward higher salinities along the 17.degree. C temperature axis with increase in exposure time, indicating that high salinities aided thermal resistance. The effect of acclimation on the response surface in the upper temperature region was negligible. The biological reasons for this were discussed with implications for the use of this method as a tool in thermal studies. In relation to thermal addition in Lake Macquarie [Australia] at least 50% mortality is expected with pronounced sublethal effects under summer conditions. No influence of size on thermal resistance was detected.																			0067-1940						1976	27	3					475	486																WOS:A1976CJ61000012

Phytoplankton assemblage dynamics in relation to environmental conditions in a riverine lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Understanding drivers of phytoplankton assemblage structure is essential given the ecological, aesthetic, and health consequences that vary among taxonomic groups. In this study, we examined phytoplankton assemblage structure over a three-year period in a natural riverine lake in the Upper Mississippi River. Phytoplankton samples along with a suite of limnological variables were collected along a longitudinal gradient of the lake to investigate potential relationships, mechanisms, and drivers between environmental conditions and phytoplankton assemblage structure. We found over 100 phytoplankton taxa and assemblage structure varied between years, months, and sites. With the use of a distance-based linear model, 32.6% of the total variation in phytoplankton assemblages was explained by a combination of chemical, hydrological, and physical variables. Additionally, we noted a one-year absence of the common diatom, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, that may have been related to an unusual spring of warm water temperature and low soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations, indicating possible nutrient limitation in a large river system. Insights into the relationships between environmental conditions and individual and co-occurring species of phytoplankton should aid in developing a greater predictability of assemblages and may enable large river scientists and managers to better anticipate and address water quality conditions under changing climate and hydrologic regimes.

While pre-existing medical conditions are a known risk factor for drowning among this age group, less is known about the role of alcohol and drugs. This 15-year (1 July 2002 to 30 June 2017) Australian study used coronial data to investigate the impact on older people (aged 65 years and older) of the obtundent effects of prescribed drugs which had been ingested by those with a positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Of the closed coronial cases with toxicological information (N = 471), one quarter (24.6%; N = 116) had consumed alcohol prior to drowning (one in seven BAC >= 0.05%), of which a third also had obtundent drugs present (33.6%; N = 39). Rivers/creeks/streams and swimming pools were the locations with the highest number of drowning deaths. Bathtubs (36.8%) and rivers/creeks/streams (17.9%) recorded the highest proportion of cases with victims having a BAC >= 0.05%. Bathtubs (13.2%), lakes (7.0%), and rivers/creeks/streams (6.8%) recorded the highest proportion of drowning cases with obtundent drug involvement. Obtundent drug involvement was significantly more likely for activities where the person who drowned was alone (i.e., unknown activity) (X-2 = 6.8; p = 0.009). Common obtundent drugs included Diazepam, Tempazepam, and Codeine.

Meteorological Driving Datasets for the US Midwest and Great Lakes Region Incorporating Precipitation Gauge Undercatch Corrections	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Precipitation (P) gauge undercatch (PUC) is an important source of error when using observed meteoro-logical datasets for hydrologic modeling studies in regions with cold and windy winters. Preliminary simulations using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model forced with different meteorological datasets showed significant underprediction of simulated streamflow throughout the domain. A new hybrid gridded meteorological dataset at 1/168 resolution based on observed station data was assembled over the U.S. Midwest and Great Lakes region from 1915 to 2021 at a daily time step. Correction of primary station data using existing techniques is generally difficult or infeasible in the United States due to missing station metadata and lack of local wind speed (WS) measurements. We developed and tested several different postprocessing adjustment techniques using regridded WS obtained from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. The most effective approach corrected rain or mixed P using WS alone, and P as snow using a regressed snow-to-P ratio from a group of wind-shielded reference stations (to account for different and generally unknown snow measurement tech-niques). The PUC-corrected gridded products were validated against high-quality shielded stations and corrected Global Historical Climatology Network stations with in situ WS, showing good overall agreement. Observed monthly streamflow at 40 river basins was also compared to hydrologic model simulations forced by datasets with and without PUC corrections. The best PUC-corrected dataset produced improvements in streamflow simulations in at least 80% of the streamflow loca-tions for three validation metrics (r2, Nash-Sutcliff efficiency, bias in the mean), demonstrating its value for hydrometeoro-logical studies in the greater Midwest region.

J	IVARSON, KC				IVARSON, KC			MICROBIOLOGY OF EXPOSED AREAS OF AQUATIC HABITATS OF NORTHERN ELLESMERE ISLAND	ARCTIC												A report is given on the microflora in exposed areas of shorelines of ponds and tarns located near Hazen Camp (81.degree. 49'', 71.degree. 18''W), northern Ellesmere Island [Canada]. At snow-melt, which generally occurs in early June, water flows into lakes and depression areas, but, as summer progresses, the water level in them drops gradually and progressively wider strips of shoreline are exposed. These contain both newly emerging vascular plants, and also those in the process of decomposition after becoming detached in previous years. Wide variations in numbers of microorganisms were observed. Salt concentration, pH and C-to-N ratio had no effect on the numbers; and, except possibly in the case of Cytophaga, temperature of incubation appeared to have no effect on them either. The presence of viable microbes in these lake shorelines, situated approximately 600 miles south of the North Pole, is very important. They are undoubtedly not only active in supplying plant nutrients but are helping to transfer part of the decaying vegetation to produce stable humus which takes part in the formation of the underlying and surrounding weakly-developed soil profiles. They also play an additional role in providing food for larger organisms.																			0004-0843	1923-1245					1975	28	4					295	298																WOS:A1975BN93200006

R.; Lin, Yuan; Radpour, Roxanne; Wadsworth, Henry			Pigment Synthesis and Analysis of Color in Art: An Example of Applied Science for High School and College Chemistry Students	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION												We present herein a module of pigment synthesis experiments that could be adapted and implemented in a variety of curricular settings. At the conclusion of each of the past two spring terms at our high school, we offered a 4 day short course on the chemical synthesis of pigments used in art. As part of the course, our students synthesized four pigments in the chemistry laboratory: Egyptian blue, madder lake (red), cobalt green, and cobalt yellow. These particular pigments were selected for several reasons: (1) they are historically significant in art and archeology (their usage spans from antiquity into the 20th century), (2) they provide for a variety in the chemical reaction types explored and the chemical synthesis methods utilized, (3) they are relatively safe for students to handle, and (4) they afford a diverse color palette upon mixing. Our students then combined their pigments with gum arabic as a binder to make gouache watercolor paints and create a painting. In the second iteration of the short course, students also collected gravimetric data during their pigment synthesis reactions and were introduced to photoluminescence imaging of paints made from Egyptian blue and madder lake pigments synthesized the prior year. We also explored the quantitative colorimetry of the paints via fiber-optic reflectance spectroscopy. On the basis of positive student feedback from our short course and on our research into similar curricular offerings at the college and university level, we are actively working to expand and broaden the material into a new, year-long, interdisciplinary elective course for our upper-level high school students that describes the application of chemistry and materials science principles to enhance our understanding and appreciation of art and archeology.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The extent of animal colouration is determined by an interplay between natural and sexual selection. Both forces probably shape colouration in the speciose, rock-dwelling cichlids of Lake Malawi. Sexual selection is thought to drive male colouration, overcoming natural selection to create conspicuous colour patterns via female mate choice and male-male competition. However, natural selection should make female cichlids cryptic because they mouthbrood their young. We hypothesize that as a result of both sexual and natural selection, males will have colours that are more conspicuous than female colours. Cichlid spectral sensitivity, especially in the ultraviolet, probably influences how colours appear to them. Here we use simple models of the trichromatic colour space of cichlid visual systems to compare the conspicuousness of male and female nuptial colours of nine species. Conspicuousness of colours was evaluated as their Euclidian distance in colour space from environmental backgrounds and from other colours on the same fish. We find in six of the nine species that breeding males have colours that are statistically more conspicuous than female colours. These colours contrast strongly with each other or with the backgrounds, and they fall within a range of spectra best transmitted in the habitat. Female colour distances were sometimes smaller, suggesting that females of some species are more cryptic than males. Therefore, selection can differentially act to generate male colours that are more conspicuous than those in females. However, in two species, females had colours that were more conspicuous than male colours, suggesting that other selective forces and possibly sexual conflicts are acting in this system.					; Cheney, Karen/A-6827-2013	Carleton, Karen/0000-0001-6306-5643; Marshall, Justin/0000-0001-9006-6713													0022-0949	1477-9145				JUL 1	2010	213	13					2243	2255		10.1242/jeb.037671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.037671								20543123					WOS:000278671900017

Analyses of organic matter delta N-15 from sediment cores show that nutrient enrichment started in the 1910s and intensified from the 1930s. Subsequent changes in sediment organic carbon content and accumulation rates, carotenoid pigment concentrations, organic matter delta C-13, and cladoceran subfossil remains show that excess nutrient inputs triggered bottom-up-driven increases in lake primary production, as well as in Daphnia abundance. Daphnia size, however, started to decrease in the late 1930s, indicating an increasing size-selective predation from zooplanktivorous whitefish populations (Coregonus lavaretus) that had been fostered by stocking and increased food availability. Whitefish predation is likely to have indirectly facilitated the establishment of Bosmina longirostris. With decreasing nutrient concentrations, Daphnia abundance decreased, but their size declined, presumably due to an ongoing size-selective predation. At this same time, Bosmina abundance doubled as a likely result of released interspecific competition from smaller Daphnia. delta N-15 analyses on subfossil cladoceran remains revealed that these changes in cladoceran community structure were accompanied by major changes in the food web. In spite of successful measures to reduce nutrient inputs from the late 1960s and reduced primary production, anoxia still occurs every summer at the lake bottom. These patterns are the consequence of a still relatively high export of phytoplankton-derived organic matter to the sediment as a result of strong top-down effects on the planktonic food chain.

We examined spatial patterns in population characteristics (density, biomass,;mean body length) and physiological condition (lipid content, length-weight) of the amphipod Diporeia spp. in Lake Michigan by collecting samples at up to 85 sites in late summer 1994 and 1995. Variables were examined relative to water depth and three lake regions: south, central and north. Most major river systems are found in the south, and this region is more nutrient-enriched compared to the north. 2. Over all sites, mean density was 5240 m(-2), biomass was 4.1 g dry wt m(-2), and mean body length was 5 mm. While maximum densities were related to depth, with a peak at 30-70 m, greatest densities occurred on the west side of the lake, and low densities were found in the south-east, north-east and lower Green Bay. High densities in the west probably resulted from upwelling, and reduced densities in the south-east may reflect food competition with Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel). 3. Lipid content, weight per unit length, and mean length declined with increased water depth, but depth-related trends were most evident in the south. Overall, mean Lipid content and weight per unit length were significantly lower in the south (16.6% dry wt, 0.59 mg at 5 mm body length) compared to the north (23.7% dry wt, 0.78 mg at 5 mm body length). These regional differences may have resulted from greater diatom availability in the north and competition from D. polymorpha in the south. Triacylglycerols and phospholipids were the dominant lipid classes in all three regions. Although the mean proportion of triacylglycerols, the energy-storage lipid, was lower in the south than in the north, regional differences in proportions of lipid classes were not significant. 4. Mean lipid content and weight per unit length of Diporeia in the south were lower than values found in the late 1980s prior to the establishment of Dreissena. Mean lipid content of mature individuals is now at levels considered a minimum for successful reproduction.																			0046-5070					JAN	2000	43	1					107	119		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00530.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00530.x													WOS:000085242000008

This study evaluates flood susceptibility in Uvira using Geographic Information Systems (GISs), and an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach. It integrates eight factors contributing to flood occurrence: distance from water bodies, elevation, slope, rainfall intensity, drainage density, soil type, topographic wetness index, and land use/land cover. The results indicate that proximity to water bodies, drainage density and slope are the most influential factors driving flood susceptibility in Uvira. Approximately 87.3% of the city's land area is classified as having high to very high flood susceptibility, with the most affected zones concentrated along major rivers and the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika. The reliability of the AHP-derived weights is validated by a consistency ratio of 0.008, which falls below the acceptable threshold of 0.1. This research provides valuable insights to support urban planning and inform flood management strategies.

Patterns in the limnology of lakes and ponds across multiple local and regional environmental gradients in the eastern Canadian Arctic	INLAND WATERS												This study examined water chemistry from 113 lakes and ponds across the eastern Canadian Arctic to address the lack of limnological data and understanding of relationships among limnological variables across key local and regional gradients. Environmental and geochemical variables were compared at both the local and regional scale with the use of multivariate analysis. A principal components analysis indicated that there was a primary gradient in temperature, nutrients, and conductivity between sampled regions. In addition, there were significant regional differences observed for nutrients total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, and dissolved major ions determined via canonical variates analysis. Across all regions TN:TP ratios were high, indicating phosphorus limitation, and mid-summer surface water temperature was strongly correlated to dissolved nitrogen concentrations. Local landscape characteristics were also examined, with multiple samples from lakes of varying elevations, surface area, and depth within the same area. Shallow pond systems (<2 m depth) were found to have significantly higher variability for major ions, especially in areas with influences from local geology. Likewise, the concentration of nutrients and ions in ponds were strongly correlated to concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, likely indicating the influence of watershed inputs and resuspended sediments on the limnology of ponds. Although there was higher regional variation in the limnology of pond systems than lakes, the general patterns within each region were similar.

J	Beltaos, S; Burrell, BC				Beltaos, Spyros; Burrell, Brian C.			Characteristics of suspended sediment and metal transport during ice breakup, Saint John River, Canada	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												During the spring freshet and the resulting breakup of river ice covers, the erosive capacity of the flow is enhanced not only by the rising discharge, but also by the highly dynamic waves that form upon the release of ice jams. Concentrations of suspended sediment and particulate contaminants, such as trace metals, increase sharply. To enhance the very limited knowledge on this issue, comprehensive data have been collected on the Saint John River (SJR). Herein, first-time data sets are presented on sediment and metal transport characteristics during the highly dynamic flow conditions of the ice breakup period. The median sediment particle size is nearly 10 mu m and decreases slightly with suspended sediment concentration (SSC). Though moving ice prevented direct examination of flocculation processes during the breakup period, indirect evidence suggests that it does occur and may be more pronounced than during open-water conditions. Owing to high breakup flow velocities, bed deposition and entrapment of suspended sediment are likely minimal in the study reach, though more pronounced in the reservoirs of downstream control structures. In general, the trace metals examined in this study exhibited strong attachment to suspended sediment. At any but the lowest of SSCs, sorbed amounts were much larger than dissolved, with the sole exception of strontium. Particulate metal concentrations and partition coefficients occurring during ice breakup in the SJR were within known ranges from previous, open-water studies and did not exceed "probable effect" levels of Canadian guidelines. Changing climatic conditions could lead to increased amounts of particulate metals. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Conway, WC; Smith, LM; Ray, JD				Conway, WC; Smith, LM; Ray, JD			Shorebird breeding biology in wetlands of the Playa Lakes, Texas, USA	WATERBIRDS												Wetlands in the Playa Lakes Region of Texas are important habitats for North American wintering waterfowl and migrant shorebirds. However, shorebird breeding biology has been overlooked in characterizing the region's ecological importance. In 1998 and 1999, American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana), Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus), Killdeer (Charadrius vocferous), and Snowy Plover (C. alexandrinus) breeding ecology were studied in playas, saline lakes, and riparian wetlands in the Playa Lakes Region of Texas. Chronology of nest initiation, clutch sizes, and hatching success for 298 Snowy Plover, 111 American Avocet, 43 Killdeer, and 26 Blacknecked Stilt clutches were measured. All four species nested in saline lakes, American Avocet and Killdeer also nested in playas, and Snowy Plover nested on riparian wetlands. American Avocet had higher hatching success in 1999 (52%) than 1998 (8%), because of more suitable hydrological conditions and lower predation. Hatching success was higher in 1998 than 1999 for Killdeer (1998, 63%; 1999, 21%) and Snowy Plover (1998, 47%; 1999, 33%) due to failures caused by flooding and hail in 1999. In other regions, clutch predation limits shorebird productivity, but hatching success in the Playa Lakes Region appears to be limited by unpredictable precipitation patterns and wetland hydroperiod. As such, breeding shorebird conservation and management should focus upon maintaining wetland hydrological integrity.

We show, however, that scattered dead-ice-blocks may have been preserved in the ground until 8500 cal. yr BP. We analysed thermokarst features in Lake Kikuru, western Latvia, by means of a multi-proxy approach (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, diatoms, loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility, C:N ratio, carbon accumulation rate and radiocarbon dating). Abiotic and biotic processes following the ice-block meltdown suggests abrupt development of a thermokarst from 8500 to 7400 cal. yr BP. Important changes in local vegetation occurred with the deepening of a kettle-hole during the transition from a fen to a lake that nearly coincided with the appearance of the first fish at 7800 cal. yr BP, thus forming a clear indication of a lacustrine environment. Our study shows that a thin peat layer formed at first and, due to the meltdown of the ice-block, it gradually lowered to the bottom of the kettle-hole, and gyttja begun to accumulate afterwards. Given that thermokarst arise when the mean summer air temperature gradually increases to a value above the present-day temperature, we must assume that the local conditions must have been exceptional to secure ice-block from the meltdown for so long. Therefore, the legacy of the last ice age was still evident even ca. 5500 years after the Weichselian ice retreat from the eastern Baltic.					; Gałka, Mariusz/ABB-1744-2020; Veski, Siim/A-9417-2014; Heinsalu, Atko/B-7080-2019; Stivrins, Normunds/H-5661-2019	Galka, Mariusz/0000-0001-8906-944X; Veski, Siim/0000-0002-8297-2385; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				AUG	2017	27	8					1146	1157		10.1177/0959683616683255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616683255													WOS:000407819800008

Reductant soluble P (Fe- and Mn-bound) at the sediment surface (0-1 cm) was considerably higher in the oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (1.29 g kg(-1)) than in the eutrophic Lake Haussee (0.32 g kg(-1)). The amounts of dissolved, loosely adsorbed, metal oxide- and calcium carbonate bound P were higher in the eutrophic lake. The depth profiles of the investigated P species indicated that the mobilization of Fe- and Mn-bound P is the most important mechanism of P-release in oligotrophic lakes, whereas the mobilization of recently sedimented labile organic bound P seems to be the driving force of P-release in eutrophic lakes. In both lakes autochthonous calcite precipitations occurs during the summer months. The coprecipitation of P with calcite is an important self-cleaning mechanism in eutrophic hardwater lakes and contributes to the permanent burial of P in the sediments. Although, the precipitation of calcite is inhibited by the presence of high concentrations of soluble reactive P, the coprecipitation of P with calcite seems to be enhanced. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

J	MARTEL, AT; GIBLING, MR				MARTEL, AT; GIBLING, MR			CLASTIC DYKES OF THE DEVONO-CARBONIFEROUS HORTON BLUFF FORMATION, NOVA-SCOTIA - STORM-RELATED STRUCTURES IN SHALLOW LAKES	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Clastic dykes are common in the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Horton Bluff Formation of Nova Scotia where they occur in wave-dominated shoreline deposits of lacustrine shoaling-upward cycles. The dykes, typically less than 25 cm wide and 40 cm in vertical extent, project downward into clayshale from broad loads at the base of elongate isolated lenses of hummocky cross-stratified siltstone. Ptygmatic folding of the dykes reflects a shale: siltstone compaction ratio of 2.3 times, and maximum depth of dyke penetration prior to compaction was > 1 m. Dyke orientation parallels the orientation of wave-ripple crests and the elongation direction of the siltstone lenses. Dyke formation was penecontemporaneous with sedimentation. Dyke and load formation was probably initiated in shallow water during storms which promoted sediment failure through cyclic wave loading, microseisms and rapid deposition of HCS-bearing siltstone lenses. Reversed-density gradient and uneven sediment loading from silt lenses probably promoted downward emplacement. Loads reflect ductile failure of surficial water-rich mud, whereas dykes reflect downward injection of silt following brittle failure of underlying, more compacted mud. The depositional slope provided a tensional stress that controlled the fracture direction (orthogonal to the slope) of the failed sediment.																			0037-0738					SEP	1993	87	1-2					103	119																WOS:A1993LY44700007
J	Jackson, LJ				Jackson, LJ			Paradigms of metal accumulation in rooted aquatic vascular plants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This paper reviews paradigms of metal accumulation in rooted aquatic vascular plants. Radio-tracer studies have demonstrated that root uptake from sediments with subsequent translocation to above-ground tissues is the principal pathway for metal movement. The metal concentration of rooted macrophytes is generally proportional to metal concentrations in the underlying sediments, excluding crystal lattice-bound metals. Deviations from 1:1 predictions between sediment and macrophyte metal concentrations have been shown to be correlated to variation in sediment geochemistry. Sediment pH, redox potential and organic content are three particularly important sediment variables that affect phase partitioning of metals, and their bioavailability. Metals contained within macrophyte tissues can participate in cycling within the littoral zone, or at senescence, lost to the surrounding water in a dissolved form or exported out of the lake bound to shoot fragments. Relatively little is known about the trophic transfer of macrophyte-bound metals to herbivores or algae. A better understanding of the role of rooted aquatic macrophytes in ecosystem processes is likely to be advanced by considering the fate of plant metals leaked during the summer, and those dissolved forms lost to the water column during senescence. Modeling metal accumulation in aquatic vascular plants has been restricted to empirical models that provide descriptions of general patterns. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

This time window is also a period of significant changes in Asian monsoonal intensity, mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Though many studies have tried to decipher paleoclimatic trends from sedimentary archives in Northeast Tibetan basins, it is often hard to distinguish local orographic effects from regional climate changes in such a tectonically active context. Here we investigated the sedimentary record of the Ashigong Formation, Guide Basin, in order to better constrain the Tibetan paleoenvironmental evolution and link it to uplift episodes and monsoonal evolution. By studying the lithology, magnetostratigraphy, redness, magnetic susceptibility, and elemental content of a similar to 500-m section, we show that the Ashigong Formation was deposited in a saline paleolake between 14.4 and 10 Ma. Lake expansion displayed cyclic variations following similar to 100-kyr cycles and weaker similar to 41-kyr cycles, reaching its maximum between similar to 11.4 and 10.5 Ma. Our results show that the Guide Basin was hydrologically closed from most of the middle Miocene, confirming previous studies that proposed an early Miocene partitioning of this basin. The maximum lake expansion between 11.4 and 10.5 Ma is coeval to a known peak of monsoonal intensity. This, and the evidence for a strong orbital control on lake expansion, supports a strong monsoonal control on the expansion of middle Miocene Tibet paleolakes. The origin of the similar to 100-kyr forcing on monsoonal moisture supply-different from Quaternary forcing-questions the climatic mechanism of these middle Miocene monsoons and suggests that westerly derived moisture might have also significantly contributed to the regional hydrological budget.

J	Rohling, EJ				Rohling, Eelco J.			Quantitative assessment of glacial fluctuations in the level of Lake Lisan, Dead Sea rift	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A quantitative understanding of climatic variations in the Levant during the last glacial cycle is needed to support archaeologists in assessing the drivers behind hominin migrations and cultural developments in this key region at the intersection between Africa and Europe. It will also foster a better understanding of the region's natural variability as context to projections of modern climate change. Detailed documentation of variations in the level of Lake Lisan - the lake that occupied the Dead Sea rift during the last glacial cycle - provides crucial climatic information for this region. Existing reconstructions suggest that Lake Lisan highstands during cold intervals of the last glacial cycle represent relatively humid conditions in the region, but these interpretations have remained predominantly qualitative. Here, I evaluate realistic ranges of the key climatological parameters that controlled lake level, based on the observed timing and amplitudes of lake-level variability. I infer that a mean precipitation rate over the wider catchment area of about 500 mm y(-1), as proposed in the literature, would be consistent with observed lake levels if there was a concomitant 15-50% increase in wind speed during cold glacial stadials. This lends quantitative support to previous inferences of a notable increase in the intensity of Mediterranean (winter) storms during glacial periods, which tracked eastward into the Levant. In contrast to highstands during 'regular' stadials, lake level dropped during Heinrich Events. I demonstrate that this likely indicates a further intensification of the winds during those times.

J	Sand-Jensen, K; Staehr, PA				Sand-Jensen, Kaj; Staehr, Peter Anton			CO2 dynamics along Danish lowland streams: water-air gradients, piston velocities and evasion rates	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We measured CO2 concentration and determined evasion rate and piston velocity across the water-air interface in flow-through chambers at eight stations along two 20 km long streams in agricultural landscapes in Zealand, Denmark. Both streams were 9-18-fold supersaturated in CO2 with daily means of 240 and 340 mu M in January-March and 130 and 180 mu M in June-August. Annual CO2 medians were 212 mu M in six other streams and 460 mu M in four groundwater wells, while seven lakes were weakly supersaturated (29 mu M). Air concentrations immediately above stream surfaces were close to mean atmospheric conditions except during calm summer nights. Piston velocity from 0.4 to 21.6 cm h(-1) was closely related to current velocity permitting calculation of evasion rates for entire streams. CO2 evasion rates were highest in midstream reaches (170-1,200 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) where CO2-rich soil water entered fast stream flow, while rates were tenfold lower (25-100 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) in slow-flowing lower reaches. CO2 evasion mainly derived from the input of CO2 in soil water. The variability of CO2 evasion along the two lowland streams covered much of the range in sub-Arctic and temperate streams reported previously. In budgets for the two stream catchments, loss of carbon from soils via the hydrological cycle was substantial (3.2-5.7 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and dominated by CO2 consumed to form HCO3 (-) by mineral dissolution (69-76%) and export of organic carbon (15-23%) relative to dissolved CO2 export (7-9%).

J	Lustig, TJ				Lustig, Timothy John			Inscription and Intergenerational Connection in Arthur Ransome's Lakeland Novels	CHILDRENS LITERATURE IN EDUCATION												Jacqueline Rose's influential notion of the "impossibility" of children's literature rests on the claim that such works "frame" the child and place the adult "first". Although Ransome's writings undoubtedly contain instances of such divisions and hierarchies, this article argues that they also explore various kinds of communication and connection. In particular, the Lakeland novels which are the focus here-Swallows and Amazons (1930/2012), Swallowdale (1931/1968), Winter Holiday (1933/2013), Pigeon Post (1936/2013) and The Picts and the Martyrs (1943/1993)-make frequent mention of literary works but also display an intense interest in messages which are written on paper but also cut into surfaces such as wood and stone. These inscriptions challenge generational hierarchies in that they establish a means for different individuals to communicate the experience of being in the same place, albeit at different times. Yet as well as conveying the excitements of discovery and exploring the consolations which can follow recognitions of belatedness, this article also argues that Ransome's Lakeland novels acknowledge and seek to manage the losses experienced by each generation.

J	Talento, S; Schneider, L; Werner, J; Luterbacher, J				Talento, Stefanie; Schneider, Lea; Werner, Johannes; Luterbacher, Juerg			Millennium-length precipitation reconstruction over south-eastern Asia: a pseudo-proxy approach	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS												Quantifying precipitation variability beyond the instrumental period is essential for putting current and future fluctuations into long-term perspective and providing a test bed for evaluating climate simulations. For south-eastern Asia such quantifications are scarce and millennium-long attempts are still missing. In this study we take a pseudo-proxy approach to evaluate the potential for generating summer precipitation reconstructions over south-eastern Asia during the past millennium. The ability of a series of novel Bayesian approaches to generate reconstructions at either annual or decadal resolutions and under diverse scenarios of pseudo-proxy records' noise is analysed and compared to the classic analogue method. We find that for all the algorithms and resolutions a high density of pseudo-proxy information is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a successful reconstruction. Among the selected algorithms, the Bayesian techniques perform generally better than the analogue method, the difference in abilities being highest over the semi-arid areas and in the decadal-resolution framework. The superiority of the Bayesian schemes indicates that directly modelling the space and time precipitation field variability is more appropriate than just relying on a pool of observational-based analogues in which certain precipitation regimes might be absent. Using a pseudo-proxy network with locations and noise levels similar to the ones found in the real world, we conclude that performing a millennium-long precipitation reconstruction over south-eastern Asia is feasible as the Bayesian schemes provide skilful results over most of the target area.					; Luterbacher, Juerg/H-2408-2018	Schneider, Lea/0000-0002-8208-7300; 													2190-4979	2190-4987				JUN 27	2019	10	2					347	364		10.5194/esd-10-347-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-347-2019													WOS:000473071400001

Increased taxonomic resolution of Laurentian Great Lakes ichthyoplankton through DNA barcoding: A case study comparison against visual identification of larval fishes from Stokes Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ichthyoplankton can be difficult to identify due to a lack of morphological differences among closely-related species. Traditional visual identification of ichthyoplankton requires special knowledge to employ morphological keys. Accurate species-level identification is often required to support monitoring programs for those taxa that are considered valued ecosystem components in environmental assessments. DNA-based methods are gaining in popularity as an alternative to visual identification techniques, but direct comparisons of methodological performance between identification techniques are lacking. The goal of this study was to evaluate and explore the consistency between visual and DNA barcoding species-level identification methods, using a case study of larval fish caught in plankton tows at Stokes Bay, Lake Huron during the spring of 2011. Four participants served as Identifiers (3 Novice, 1 Expert) for visual identification of this multi-species set of larval fishes; including Lake Whitefish, Lake Herring, Yellow Perch, Iowa Darter, Ghost Shiner, and Rainbow Smelt. Barcoding successfully identified 51/55 (92.7%) of the larval fishes, while visual identification using a dichotomous key showed substantial variation between observers, and across family/species. There was a 93.7% consistency between visual and barcoding identification at the family level, and a 71.5% consistency level between visual and barcoding at the species level. Potential sources of error are discussed for both identification methods, leading to a recommendation for the coordinated use of both visual and barcoding identification methods to improve species-level assessments for wild ichthyoplankton samples.

J	JOHNSON, WE; HASLER, AD				JOHNSON, WE; HASLER, AD			RAINBOW TROUT PRODUCTION IN DYSTROPHIC LAKES	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												After rotenone removal of resident fishes, pure populations of rainbow trout were maintained by stocking in a series of small, natural and artificially alkalized bog lakes in northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan. The vital statistics at various levels of standing crop were followed. An inverse relationship between total standing crop of trout and growth was shown. From this relationship the carrying capacity (maximum weight of trout at which a desirable rate of growth persists) of such lakes was approximately 50 lb. per acre. The principal trout food was zooplankton. Zooplankton density (availability of food), total standing crop of trout (competition), temperature, and size of the trout were considered the ecological factors largely determining growth. Multiple and partial correlations of these factors with growth-rate indicate all four factors are important in determining growth, with competition being the most important at high levels of standing crop; also, availability of food, temperature, and size of trout appear to be density-dependent factors. Rate of trout growth at low levels of standing crop appears to be largely regulated by the length of the growing season and temperatures during that season; however, as standing crop increases, competition within the trout population results in slower growth-rate; food being the source of competition and the space in which the food is concentrated and the density of food within this area of concentration determining the degree of competition and therefore carrying capacity. Natural mortality appears to be largely attributable to predator birds, and the amount of such mortality is dependent on the number of predators present and not on the density of trout. A unique part of this study has been the use of an hourglass-shaped lake whose two basins were separated by an earthen barrier to form two separate lakes one receiving lime treatment and the other a natural control. In the former the "living zone" was deepened through increased light penetration. Winter-kill occurred in the control lake but not in the treated lake in 1953.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1954	18	1					113	134		10.2307/3797621	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3797621													WOS:A1954XS09500012
J	Muir, DG; Perissinotto, R				Muir, David G.; Perissinotto, Renzo			Persistent Phytoplankton Bloom in Lake St. Lucia (iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa) Caused by a Cyanobacterium Closely Associated with the Genus Cyanothece (Synechococcaceae, Chroococcales)	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Lake St. Lucia, iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa, is the largest estuarine lake in Africa. Extensive use and manipulation of the rivers flowing into it have reduced freshwater inflow, and the lake has also been subject to a drought of 10 years. For much of this time, the estuary has been closed to the Indian Ocean, and salinities have progressively risen throughout the system, impacting the biotic components of the ecosystem, reducing zooplankton and macrobenthic biomass and diversity in particular. In June 2009, a bloom of a red/orange planktonic microorganism was noted throughout the upper reaches of Lake St. Lucia. The bloom persisted for at least 18 months, making it the longest such bloom on record. The causative organism was characterized by light and electron microscopy and by 16S rRNA sequencing and was shown to be a large, unicellular cyanobacterium most strongly associated with the genus Cyanothece. The extent and persistence of the bloom appears to be unique to Lake St. Lucia, and it is suggested that the organism's resistance to high temperatures, to intense insolation, and to hypersalinity as well as the absence of grazing pressure by salinity-sensitive zooplankton all contributed to its persistence as a bloom organism until a freshwater influx, due to exceptionally heavy summer rains in 2011, reduced the salinity for a sufficient length of time to produce a crash in the cyanobacterium population as a complex, low-salinity biota redeveloped.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				SEP	2011	77	17					5888	5896		10.1128/AEM.00460-11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00460-11								21742912					WOS:000294205700007

Inter-laboratory differences in the apparent quantum yield for the photochemical production of dissolved inorganic carbon in inland waters and implications for photochemical rate modeling	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Solar radiation initiates photochemical oxidation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in inland waters, contributing to their carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Models can determine photochemical DIC production over large spatiotemporal scales and assess its role in aquatic C cycling. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) spectrum for photochemical DIC production, defined as mol DIC produced per mol chromophoric dissolved organic matter-absorbed photons, is a critical model parameter. In previous studies, the principle for the determination of AQY spectra is the same but methodological specifics differ, and the extent to which these differences influence AQY spectra and simulated aquatic DIC photoproduction is unclear. Here, four laboratories determined AQY spectra from water samples of eight inland waters that are situated in Alaska, Finland, and Sweden and span a nearly 10-fold range in DOM absorption coefficients. All AQY values fell within the range previously reported for inland waters. The inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) for wavelength-integrated AQY spectra (300-450 nm) averaged 38% +/- 3% SE, and the inter-water CV averaged 63% +/- 1%. The inter-laboratory CV for simulated photochemical DIC production (conducted for the five Swedish lakes) averaged 49% +/- 12%, and the inter-water CV averaged 77% +/- 10%. This uncertainty is not surprising given the complexities and methodological choices involved in determining DIC AQY spectra and needs to be considered when applying photochemical rate modeling. Thus, we also highlight current methodological limitations and suggest future improvements for DIC AQY determination to reduce inter-laboratory uncertainty.					; Powers, Leanne/JVD-7846-2023; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011; Miller, William/O-5541-2016	Miller, William/0000-0003-2444-0214; Gu, Yufei/0000-0002-6606-2592; Cory, Rose/0000-0001-9867-7084; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Vahatalo, Anssi/0000-0003-3434-5915; Powers, Leanne/0000-0002-3538-7431													1541-5856					JUN	2022	20	6					320	337		10.1002/lom3.10489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10489		APR 2022											WOS:000778761100001

The intrusion of a cultivated variety by progressive propagation and its affect on aquatic habitat is demonstrated in this case study. We have studied the genetic diversity, population, and stand structure of the neophyte Nymphaea x 'Panama Pacific' as well as other species found in Lake H,viz and dikes nearby using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. The ISSR assay revealed a low genetic variability for the small populations of Nymphaea caerulea, Nymphaea lotus var. thermalis, and a medium level for Nymphaea alba, Nymphaea rubra var. longiflora, and Nymphaea Au 'Panama Pacific'. The evolutionary genetic status of individuals found in the overlapping cultivation area of Nymphaea Au 'Panama Pacific' and N. caerulea was affirmed to be of hybrid origin by reticulate network analysis and with morphological parameters. The Bayesian analysis of hybrid classes and the segregation of the ISSR markers also confirmed the hybrid origin of the individuals in question and revealed that they are falling into F2 or latter genotype frequency classes, indicating the viability and fertility of the hybrids. The set of analyzed species by phylogenetic network analysis of ISSR data has been divided into three major groups according to their evolutionary patterns (subg. Barachyceras, Lotos, and Nymphaea).

Microbial communities in an oligotrophic reservoir influenced by high levels of ionizing radiation	RADIOPROTECTION												In this study, we investigated the microbial community (bacteria and protozooplankton) of a Brazilian reservoir that receives neutralized acid mine drainage flowing from piles of earth produced during uranium extraction. Thus, this research represents an attempt to fill a gap in the information on the ecology of freshwater microorganisms in tropical oligotrophic habitats, in particular in systems affected by high levels of the uranium. During the study, we observed very low chlorophyll a contents and protozooplankton cell densities and biomass. These cell densities were between 0 and 89 cells L-1 and were lower than those frequently reported for oligotrophic freshwater lakes. In contrast, bacterial densities were normal or even slightly high, between 1.85 to 6.0 x 10(9) cells L-1. The present study has demonstrated very low protozooplankton cell densities and biomass in oligotrophic reservoir under the influence of acidic mining effluents and of high levels of ionizing radiation. It is likely that the ciliate cell densities and biomasses recorded in this study, which fall significantly below the previously published values, can be explained by the chronic fractionated exposure of these protozoa to the high levels of uranium to this system.

Algal structure of the littoral epilithon in lentic water bodies at Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												We studied the composition and density of the algae of the littoral epilithon and the taxa turnover in nine lentic water bodies at Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, during summer 2002. At each site we measured the main physical and chemical variables, and took epilithic samples for the algal analysis. Two composed samples (one for qualitative and one for quantitative analysis) were taken randomly about 1 m away from the shore-line of each sampling site. The morphology of the algal mats could be included in the 'moat and pond type' in which Cyanobacteria are well represented. A total of 69 algal taxa were recorded in the whole study area. Chlorophyceae showed the highest taxa richness (33%), followed by Cyanobacteria (29%), Bacillariophyceae (26%), Chrysophyceae (10%), and Tribophyceae (2%). As a result of the redundancy analysis performed, we found that the number, composition, and density of taxa in the water bodies at Hope Bay were strongly influenced by nitrate and suspended solids concentrations and by the distance from the sea. The geographical trend in taxa turnover within Hope Bay was explained by elements from the combination of the metapopulation dynamics and the continuum theories, which are related to dispersal limitation and environmental heterogeneity, respectively.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				JUL	2006	29	8					668	680		10.1007/s00300-005-0104-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-005-0104-3													WOS:000238715800006

The relative sea-level rise was more than 9 m in an area which subsequently experienced an emergence of almost 60 m. The sea-level curve is based on the stratigraphy of six isolation basins with bedrock thresholds. Effort has been made to establish an accurate chronology using a calendar year time-scale by C-14 wiggle matching and the use of time synchronic markers (the Vedde Ash Bed and the post-glacial rise in Betula (birch) pollen). The sea-level curve demonstrates that the Younger Dryas transgression started close to the Allerod-Younger Dryas transition and that the high stand was reached only 200 yr before the Younger Dryas-Holocene boundary. The sea level remained at the high stand for about 300 yr and 100 yr into Holocene it started to fall rapidly. The peak of the Younger Dryas transgression occurred simultaneously with the maximum extent of the ice-sheet readvance in the area. Our results support earlier geophysical modelling concluding a causal relationship between the Younger Dryas glacier advance and Younger Dryas transgression in western Norway. We argue that the sea-level curve indicates that the Younger Dryas glacial advance started in the late Allerod or close to the Allerod-Younger Dryas transition.

J	Walker, IR; Levesque, AJ; Cwynar, LC; Lotter, AF				Walker, IR; Levesque, AJ; Cwynar, LC; Lotter, AF			An expanded surface-water palaeotemperature inference model for use with fossil midges from eastern Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Using an expanded surface sample data set, representing lakes distributed across a transect from southernmost Canada to the Canadian High Arctic, a revised midge-palaeotemperature inference model was developed for eastern Canada. Modelling trials with weighted averaging (with classical and inverse deshrinking; with and without tolerance downweighting) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression, with and without square-root transformation of the species data, were used to identify the best model. Comparison of measured and predicted temperatures revealed that a 2 component WA-PLS model for square-root transformed percentage species data provided the model with the highest explained variance (r(jack)(2)=0.88) and the lowest error estimate (RMSEPjack=2.26 degrees C). Comparison of temperature inferences based on the new and old models indicates that the original model may have seriously under-estimated the magnitude of late-glacial temperature oscillations in Atlantic Canada. The new inferences suggest that summer surface water temperatures in Splan Pond, New Brunswick were approximately 10 to 12 degrees C immediately following deglaciation and during the Younger Dryas. During the Allerod and early Holocene, surface water temperatures of 20 to 24 degrees C were attained. The new model thus provides the basis for more accurate palaeotemperature reconstructions throughout easternmost Canada.

We determined the concentrations of Be-10 and Be-9 in samples pretreated following two procedures: acidification before (procedure A) and after (procedure B) removal of particles. The Be-10 and Be-9 concentrations spanned wide ranges. Concentrations in procedure A samples were higher than those in procedure B samples. The Be-10/Be-9 ratios fell within a narrow range, and values from CRREL (about 8.5 x 10(-9)) and Barrow (about 7 x 10(-9)) were of the same order of magnitude. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and assess the feasibility of using the Be-10/Be-9 ratio of syngenetic ice wedges for reconstruction of 10Be variations due to cosmogenic and environmental changes, and radiometric dating of ice-wedge sequences that contain very old (beyond 1 Ma) ice.

The SIP disk sampler has a higher sorptive capacity compared to the PUF disk sampler, due to its impregnation with ground XAD resin. The two sampler types were codeployed at 20 sites during the 2009, 3-month long spring sampling period of the GAPS Network Air concentrations for chlordanes (trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane, and trans-nonachlor) and endosulfans (endosulfan I, endosulfan II, and endosulfan sulfate) derived from PUF disk and SIP disk samplers showed near 1:1 agreement and confirmed previous results for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Discrepancies observed for alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH in PLTF disk versus SIP disk are attributed to lack of "comparability" of the PUF and SIP data sets, due to differences in effective air sampled by the two devices caused by saturation of these higher volatility compounds in the lower capacity PUF disk samplers. Analysis of PBDEs in PUF and SIP disks showed relatively good agreement but highlighted challenges associated with high blanks levels for PBDEs. The higher capacity SIP disk samplers allowed for the analysis of pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz) and hexachlorobenzene (HCBz) and revealed a relatively uniform global distribution of these compounds. The results of this study further validate the SIP disk sampler as a complement to the PUF disk sampler, with capabilities for a broad range of POPs targeted under international POPs treaties such as the Stockholm Convention on POPs and its Global Monitoring Plan.																			0013-936X					JAN 3	2012	46	1					391	396		10.1021/es2032289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es2032289								22103600					WOS:000298762900052
C	di Biases, A			AIAA	di Biases, Antonio			Francesco De Pinedo, Neapolitan Navy officer, one of the greatest pioneers of flight	AIAA SCITECH 2024 FORUM					AIAA SciTech Forum	JAN 08-12, 2024	Orlando, FL	AIAA				When discussing about merits of people it is always very difficult to make rankings. For this reason it would be questionable to argue that Francesco De Pinedo has been the greatest Italian aviator ever. Nevertheless, among the pioneers of flight, not only Italians, he was certainly one of the greatest. Probably also inspired by the stage trip to Tokyo conducted by Arturo Ferrarin and Guido Masiero in 1920, he subsequently inspired Italo Balbo and Benito Mussolini (the famous dictator himself) who highly regarded him both as an aviator and as a man. However, they were not in condition to protect the neapolitan officer from the enmities he acquired, aided by his own pride, in the second part of his fulminant but short career. Leaving from Sesto Calende, an Italian town on Lake Maggiore, De Pinedo became famous above all for his 30,000-mile stage flight to Australia and back to Rome in 1925. He died charred in 1933, after falling into disgrace at the Air Force, at the take-off of its scheduled one jump flight from New York to Baghdad, which would have broken the long-distance world record.

J	Schiefer, E; Gilbert, R; Hassan, MA				Schiefer, Erik; Gilbert, Robert; Hassan, Marwan A.			A lake sediment-based proxy of floods in the Rocky Mountain Front Ranges, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We analyzed lake sediment deposits and local hydrometric records to assess the potential for developing a high-resolution record of sediment delivery from the Rock Lake catchment, situated in the non-glacierized Front Ranges of the Rocky Mountains, Canada. Rhythmic couplets of silt-clay characterized the clastic sediments recovered from the deep central basin of the lake. Contemporary sediment yield to Rock Lake (10.7 +/- A 1.8 Mg km(-2) year(-1)) is comparable to other studied Canadian Cordillera lakes that have sedimentary lithologies and absence of glacier cover, but distinct rhythmic deposition is relatively unique to this basin. Spatial patterns of deposition within the lake were assessed by correlating rhythmites between multiple sediment cores and by sub-bottom, acoustic profiling. Bracketed dates for a spatially continuous sequence of eight thick rhythmites were established by correlating laminations between core samples collected more than 30 years apart. We identified a consistent pattern between the rhythmite and hydrometric data series between 1975 and 2006 and determined that specific flooding events caused by summer rainstorms are associated with each of the eight thick rhythmites. We observed a good relationship between rhythmite thickness and total flood volume that exceeded a threshold discharge. Acoustic profiling showed that the lake could be a good candidate for longer-term proxy development. We discuss how some of the methods used in this study could benefit ongoing paleoenvironmental assessments based on lacustrine rhythmite series.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2011	45	2					137	149		10.1007/s10933-010-9485-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9485-6													WOS:000286677000002
J	SALYI, G				SALYI, G			ABOUT THE TOXICOSIS CAUSED BY BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE	MAGYAR ALLATORVOSOK LAPJA												Different species of blue-green algae, growing in large amounts under certain conditions in fresh-waters, can produce toxins in such quantities that may endanger the health of domestic animals and wildlife. Based on literature data, mechanism of action of hepatotoxins and neurotoxins of such an origin, the clinical symptoms, pathological and histopathological alterations, as well an possibilities of the laboratory diagnosis have been summarized according to practical point of views. A separate chapter has treated the possible connections between the algal bloom caused by blue-green algae and causal death of fish and water fowls. A case from the practice has also been reported when many hundreds of grazing cattle fell sick with clinical signs of restlessness, salivation, lachrymation, tremor, difficult movement. Death was not observed. Analysis of the environmental conditions suggested that the disease was connected with the algal bloom caused by blue-green algae of a small lakelet, serving for drinking of animals. Great amounts of Anabaena vigueieri, as well Oscillatoria granulata were demonstrated by the microscopic investigation of the water. The suspension of algae caused slight dyspnoea and faintness without death in intraperitoneally inoculated mice. Presumably, the disease of cattle was caused by the neurotoxin produced by blue-green algae.																			0025-004X					FEB	1994	49	2					96	101																WOS:A1994NB76300005

This study determines the mass-specific absorption coefficients of chlorophyll a (a*(chl)), phycocyanin (a*(pc)), minerals (a*(m)), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM; a*(CDOM)) and the absorption coefficient for CDOM (a(CDOM)) for three central Indiana reservoirs. Absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer equipped with a Spectralon coated integrating sphere. Quantitative measurements from either fluorometric (chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, CDOM) or weight-based (mineral) measurements were used to determine the mass-specific absorption coefficients tested in this study and an exponential function was used to estimate aCDOM. While a*chl showed minimum variability between reservoirs, a*(pc), a*(m), a*(CDOM) and a(CDOM) showed statistically significant differences between reservoirs; however, for a*(m), there was greater variation within each reservoir. Variability in a*(CDOM) and a(CDOM) between reservoirs was likely due to different inflows. All absorption coefficients fell within previously published ranges for each constituent examined, with the exception of a*(pc). Differences in a*(pc) were likely due to different techniques used in extracting and estimating phycocyanin. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Intensive trapping and increased fish predation cause massive population decline of an invasive crayfish	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Invasive species frequently have adverse impacts on native communities and ecosystems. Management options are often limited. Our goal is to evaluate the effect of intensive trapping and fish predation on the population dynamics of an invasive crayfish. 2. From 2001 to 2005, we removed invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) by trapping in Sparkling Lake in northern WI. In addition, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources restricted harvest of fish species known to consume crayfish, thereby increasing predation on crayfish that are too small to trap. 3. After an initial increase, catch rates of rusty crayfish declined by approximately 95%, from 11 crayfish per trap per day in 2002 to 0.65 in 2004. The catch rate in 2005 remained low at 0.5 crayfish per trap. Females comprised nearly 50% of the catch from 2002 to 2004. Unlike rusty crayfish in Sparkling Lake, catch rates of O. rusticus and Orconectes propinquus in three nearby lakes increased or remained relatively constant over the 5-year removal period. 4. We also examined the influence of habitat and temperature on crayfish catch rates. Catch rates were highest at water temperatures between 20 and 25 degrees C and on cobble, log or macrophyte habitats that may serve as refuge from fish predation. 5. Five summers of intensive trapping and fisheries management practices reduced abundances, but did not extirpate rusty crayfish in Sparkling Lake. To determine the potential of trapping as a management option for invasive crayfishes, these methods must be tested in other systems.					; Hein, Catherine/C-7202-2012	Hein, Catherine/0000-0003-0160-655X; Vander Zanden, Jake/0000-0002-8122-1416; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2007	52	6					1134	1146		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01741.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01741.x													WOS:000246904500014

However, the driving mechanisms of aeolian activity in ACA during the Holocene are unclear, making it difficult to predict possible future aeolian activity. We used AMS (14) C dating, combined with grain-size analysis, high- resolution X-ray fluorescence scanning, and scanning electron microscopy of a sediment core from Lake Ailike, in the Junggar Basin, to reconstruct the history of aeolian activity in ACA during the Holocene. We found that periods of increased aeolian activity on the millennial-scale are correlated with the strengthening of the Siberian High, and that there is a consistency between aeolian activity and climatic fluctuations in the mid- latitudes of Europe. These findings support a close relationship between climate fluctuations in mid- and high- latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Lower/higher temperatures in high latitudes result in the expansion/contraction of polar air masses, leading to the strengthening/weakening of the Siberian High. Additionally, more/less frequent aeolian activity in ACA corresponded to cooling/warming trends in the mid-latitudes of Europe during the Holocene. While ongoing global warming may lead to a long-term decrease in aeolian activity in ACA, the weakening of the polar vortex has resulted in more frequent cold waves affecting the mid-latitudes of Eurasia during winter in recent years.

J	Hughes, PDM; Mauquoy, D; Barber, KE; Langdon, PG				Hughes, PDM; Mauquoy, D; Barber, KE; Langdon, PG			Mire-development pathways and palaeoclimatic records from a full Holocene peat archive at Walton Moss, Cumbria, England	HOLOCENE												Plant macrofossil data have been used to identify the successive mire communities occupying both central and marginal locations in the Walton Moss peatland complex, during the last 10 500 years. The reconstructed pathways of mire development indicate that early-Holocene Een and fen-carr communities were succeeded by species indicative of deep mire water tables and oligotrophic conditions. The character of the fen/bog transition (FBT) is compared with similar records of peatland development from Britain and Scandinavia and with independent climate data for the early Holocene. The 'pseudohochmoor' of central Europe is suggested as an approximate modern analogue for the dry pioneer oligotrophic mire type and alternative explanations for its presence are explored. The first major increase in ombrotrophic Sphagna occurred at c. 7800 cal. BP. Overlying Sphagnum peats provide a continuous record of climate change, inferred from fluctuations in raised mire surface wetness. The proxy palaeoclimate record, reconstructed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis, registers wet shifts commencing at c. 7800, c. 5300, 4410-3990 (2 sigma range), c. 3500, 3170-2860 (2 sigma range), 2320-2040 (2 sigma range), c. 1750, c. 1450, c. 300 and c. 100 cal. BP. This climate record is compared with a similar one from Bolton Fell Moss and spectral analysis of the time-series gives periodicities of c. 1100 years and c. 600 years between wet shifts.					; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013; Mauquoy, Dmitri/AAF-1044-2019	Hughes, Paul/0000-0002-8447-382X; Langdon, Peter/0000-0003-2724-2643; Mauquoy, Dmitri/0000-0002-8056-8258; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2000	10	4					465	479		10.1191/095968300675142023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968300675142023													WOS:000087983500005

Reuse of sediment silted in reservoirs as fertilizer has been proposed, thus transforming nutrient-enriched sediments from waste into resource. The aim of this study is to assess the potential of reusing sediment as a nutrient source for agriculture a semiarid basin in Brazil. where 1029 reservoirs were identified. Sedimentation was modelled for the entire reservoir network, accounting for 7 x 10(5) tons of y(-1)sediment deposition. Nutrients contents in reservoir sediments was analysed and com- pared to nutrients contents of agricultural soils in the catchment. The potential of reusing sediment as fertilizer was assessed for maize crops (Zea mays L) and the sediment mass required to fertilize the soil was computed considering that the crop nitrogen requirement would be fully provided by the sediment. Economic feasibility was analysed by comparing the costs of the proposed practice to those obtained if the area was fertilized by traditional means. Results showed that, where reservoirs fall dry frequently and sediments can be removed by excavation, soil fertilization with sediment presents lower costs than those observed for application of commercial chemical fertilizers. Compared to conventional fertilization, when using sediments with high nutrient content, 25% of costs could be saved, while when using sediments with low nutrient content costs are 9% higher. According to the local conditions, sediments with nitrogen content above 1.5 g kg(-1) are cost efficient as nitrogen source. However, physical and chemical analyses are recommended to define the sediment mass to be used and to identify any constraint to the application of the practice, like the high sodium adsorption ratio observed in one of the studied reservoirs, which can contribute to soil salinization.

However, gravel pit lakes are also recognized as valuable wildlife refuge areas. Different hydromorphological characteristics of gravel pits may influence aquatic biota differently. Optimal selection of gravel excavation procedures may create favorable conditions for ecosystem diversity. The aim of this study was to correlate hydromorphological variables against macrophyte composition and metrics in gravel pit lakes along the lower course of the Drina River. Field research was carried out at 18 gravel pit lakes (60 survey sectors) and four fluvial lakes (13 survey sectors), during the summer months of 2015, 2016 and 2018. The role of hydromorphological variables in structuring macrophyte assemblages was tested using the partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis, while the Generalized Linear Model was performed to test the ability of selected hydromorphological attributes to predict macrophyte quantitative metrics. The results demonstrated high habitat quality and conservation value of the gravel pit lakes compared to natural sites. Hydromorphological predictors for different macrophyte assemblages were defined. General recommendation is that two pit types should be excavated within a single extraction field, with the minimal impact to the riparian and shore zones. The first type should be located up to 100m from river main channel, having area <1000m(2) and a relative depth ratio >5%. The second type should be optimally located 300m form river main channel, with maximum depth of 3-4m, surface area of 10,000-20,000m(2), and a relative depth ratio <5%.

Bait dealers' roles in preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and fish pathogens in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The spread of fish pathogens and aquatic invasive species (AIS) is an ongoing challenge in the Great Lakes region. Bait dealers can prevent the spread of fish pathogens and AIS through their business practices and by educating their customers. Little is known, however, about whether and how they fulfill these roles. Licensed bait dealers in the Great Lakes region were surveyed by mail during fall 2013 to assess their awareness and concern about fish pathogens and AIS, actions they took to prevent their spread, and factors influencing these actions. Most bait dealers were aware of AIS and fish pathogens, many were concerned about them, and held beliefs suggesting their desire to take action to prevent their spread. These concerns and beliefs, however, did not always lead to action. We found two factors, not previously examined, that affected the probability of actual behavior. First, we found differences in participation in business practices by whether or not the state/province had regulations pertaining to those business practices. We also found differences by state/province in the degree and type of communication methods used to educate their customers. Second, we found greater economic dependence on bait sales was associated with increased AIS-preventative business actions and communication with customers. If fishery managers want to increase the number of bait dealers taking action to prevent the spread of AIS and fish pathogens, they may wish to promote additional regulations in states and provinces that do not currently have them, or strengthen regulations already in place.

Variation in Terrestrial and Aquatic Sources of Methylmercury in Stream Predators as Revealed by Stable Mercury Isotopes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mercury (Hg) is widely distributed in the environment, and its organic form, methylmercury (MeHg), can extensively bioaccumulate and biomagnify in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Concentrations of MeHg in organisms are highly variable, and the sources in natural food webs are often not well understood. This study examined stable isotope ratios of MeHg (mass-dependent fractionation, as delta Hg-202(MeHg); and mass-independent fractionation, as Delta Hg-199(MeHg)) in benthic invertebrates, juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and water striders (Gerris remigis) along a stream productivity gradient, as well as carnivorous terrestrial invertebrates, in a forested watershed at the headwater of South Fork Eel River in northern California. Throughout the sampling sites, delta Hg-202(MeHg) (after correction due to the effect of MeHg photodegradation) was significantly different between benthic (median = -1.40 parts per thousand; range, -2.34 to -0.78 parts per thousand; total number of samples = 29) and terrestrial invertebrates (median = +0.51 parts per thousand; range, -0.37 to +1.40 parts per thousand; total number of samples = 9), but no major difference between these two groups was found for Delta Hg-199(MeHg). Steelhead trout (52 individual fishes) have MeHg of predominantly aquatic origins, with a few exceptions at the upstream locations (e.g., 1 fish collected in a tributary had a purely terrestrial MeHg source and 4 fishes had mixed aquatic and terrestrial MeHg sources). Water striders (seven pooled samples) derive MeHg largely from terrestrial sources throughout headwater sections. These data suggest that direct terrestrial subsidy (e.g., terrestrial invertebrates falling into water) can be important for some stream predators in headwater streams and could represent an important means of transfer of terrestrially derived MeHg (e.g., in situ methylation within forests, atmospheric sources) to aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, these findings show that terrestrial subsidies can enhance MeHg bioaccumulation of consumers in headwater streams where aqueous MeHg levels are very low.

In samples taken from and incubated at 0.5 m, the rate of N fixation per unit volume of water was lowest at night (< 6% of the maximum daytime rate), increased from dawn until early afternoon and then diminished between late afternoon and the 1st hour of darkness. This pattern was caused partly by diel changes in light intensity and partly by diel migrations of heterocystous blue-green algae. Heterocyst concentrations at 0.5 m increased between midmorning and early afternoon and then decreased from late afternoon until evening. The heterocyst-specific N fixation rates (N fixed per heterocyst per unit time) at 0.5 m were much less variable than the N fixation rates per unit volume of water. Heterocyst-specific rates rose rapidly in early morning and fell slowly in the evening, but were almost constant over much of the day. Heterocyst-specific N fixation rates were very close to those predicted by a model based on the light dependency of N fixation. There was no evidence for temporal changes in the light response of N fixation.

High rates of sulfate reduction were observed at the sediment surface, where the sulfate pool (0.2 mM SO42-) had a turnover time of 10-24 h. Daily sulfate reduction rates in Lake Mendota sediment varied at 50-600 nmol of SO42- cm-3, depending on temperature and sampling date. Rates of sulfate reduction in the water column were 103 times lower than that for the surface sediment and, on an areal basis, accounted for < 18% of the total sulfate reduction in the hypolimnion during summer stratification. Rates of bacterial sulfate reduction in the sediment were not sulfate limited at sulfate concentrations > 0.1 mM in short-term experiments. Although sulfate reduction seemed to be sulfate limited below 0.1 mM, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were not observed. The optimum temperature (36.degree.-37.degree. C) for sulfate reduction in the sediment was considerably higher than in situ temperatures (1.degree.-13.degree. C). The response of sulfate reduction to the addition of various electron donors metabolized by sulfate-reducing bacteria in pure culture was investigated. The degree of stimulation was in the order H2 > n-butanol > n-propanol > ethanol > glucose. Acetate and lactate caused no stimulation.

The 2013 flood event in the South Saskatchewan and Elk River basins: Causes, assessment and damages	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												In late June 2013, heavy rainfall and rapidly melting alpine snow triggered flooding throughout much of the southern half of Alberta. Heavy rainfall commenced on 19 June and continued for 3 days. When the event was over, more than 200 mm and as much as 350 mm of precipitation had fallen over the Front Ranges of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Tributaries to the Bow River including the Ghost, Kananaskis, Elbow, Sheep and Highwood, and many of their tributaries, all reached flood levels. The storm had a large spatial extent causing flooding to the north and south in the Red Deer and Oldman Basins, and also to the west in the Elk River in British Columbia. Convergence of the nearly synchronous floodwaters downstream in the South Saskatchewan River system caused record high releases from Lake Diefenbaker through Gardiner Dam. Dam releases in Alberta and Saskatchewan attenuated the downstream flood peak such that only moderate flooding occurred in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. More than a dozen municipalities declared local states of emergency; numerous communities were placed under evacuation order in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The media reported that more than 100,000 people needed to evacuate their homes, and five people died. At CAD$6 billion, the Province of Alberta estimated that it was the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. At their peak, the water levels were the highest in the past 60 years, and nearing those of historic events of the late 1800s and early 1900s where records exist. There was major damage to infrastructure roads, bridges and culverts. Downtown Calgary was inundated, as were many communities such as High River and Bragg Creek. Debris flows and debris torrents affected communities such as Canmore and Exshaw, and isolated many mountain communities including closing the TransCanada Highway for several days. Environment Canada called it the "Flood of Floods." Insured losses of CAD$2 billion included thousands of cars and homes demolished and damaged by backed-up sewers. Flood damage losses and recovery costs from the flood are projected to exceed CAD$6 billion.

INTERNAL BOUNDARY-LAYER STRUCTURE	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Some observations of the structure of the internal boundary layer as a response to contrasts in shoreline temperature and buoyancy flux were described. The experiment, conducted in the spring of 1978 on the north shore of Lake Erie [USA, Canada], near the town of Nanticoke, consisted of the spatial deployment of acoustic sounders, free rising and tethered balloons, surface tower and flux measurements, and associated chemistry and diffusion measurements. The structure of the internal boundary layer was examined descriptively and analytically in terms of a similarity format. Two internal boundary layers were detected: one to adjust the bulk buoyancy contrast of the (cold) onshore flow to the warm land, the other to adjust the flow for the upward heat flux into the onshore flow during the day. An equilibrium level was achieved in the 1st case when the buoyant mixing completed the erosion of the local buoyant surplus near the ground, thereby stopping the production of buoyant turbulence and the entrainment growth of the layer. The 2nd type of layer, which apparently had not been described in the literature, was more significant in defining the location and magnitude of maximum ground level concentrations in a daytime shoreline fumigation situation. Some simple empirical formulations were offered for the entrainment growth of each type of internal boundary layer.																			1352-2310	1873-2844					1982	16	3					423	437		10.1016/0004-6981(82)90152-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(82)90152-4													WOS:A1982NC43000005

The Richelieu River is the last section of the complex Richelieu basin, which is composed of the large Lake Champlain located in a valley between two large mountains. Previous attempts in reproducing the Richelieu River flow relied on the use of simplified lumped models and showed mixed results. In order to prepare a tool to assess accurately the change of flood recurrences in the future, a state-of-the-art distributed hydrological model was applied over the Richelieu basin. The model setup comprises several novel methods and data sets such as a very high resolution river network, a modern calibration technique considering the net basin supply of Lake Champlain, a new optimization algorithm, and the use of an up-to-date meteorological data set to force the model. The results show that the hydrological model is able to satisfactorily reproduce the multiyear mean annual hydrograph and the 2011 flow time series when compared with the observed river flow and an estimation of the Lake Champlain net basin supply. Many factors, such as the quality of the meteorological forcing data, that are affected by the low density of the station network, the steep terrain, and the lake storage effect challenged the simulation of the river flow. Overall, the satisfactory validation of the hydrological model allows to move to the next step, which consists in assessing the impacts of climate change on the recurrence of Richelieu River floods.					; Ricard, Simon/AAY-3986-2020	Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750; Ricard, Simon/0000-0002-3049-8933; 														1942-2466				APR	2020	12	4							e2019MS001709	10.1029/2019MS001709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001709													WOS:000538038300006

However, incubation approaches are increasingly being replaced by methods that analyze diel changes in high-frequency in situ data such as free-water dissolved oxygen (O-2). While there is a rich literature on the comparison of approaches for estimating primary production using incubations (e.g., C-14 and O-2 bottle experiments), as well for approaches using high-frequency data (e.g., diel O-2 and CO2 metabolism models), there are few direct comparisons of C-14 incubations and free-water O-2 approaches for estimating primary production. We used 20 lake-years of concurrent measurements of primary production quantified from high-frequency free-water O-2 data and C-14 incubations in four different lakes (4-7 years per lake) to compare these different approaches. Across all lakes, 61% of the C-14 production estimates were within the 95% credible intervals of the free-water O-2 production estimates. Error-in-variable regressions support the assumption that C-14 methods estimate a production value between gross primary production and net primary production and the bottle effect is constant across the entire range of production values considered here. There was little evidence that daily pelagic, epilimnetic estimates of primary production differed substantially based on the selection of free-water O-2 or C-14 approaches in these lakes during summer stratified conditions.					; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020; Scordo, Facundo/LSL-2910-2024; Batt, Ryan/D-7690-2013; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020; Solomon, Christopher/E-6284-2014	Vanni, Michael/0000-0001-8690-9124; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; Scordo, Facundo/0000-0001-6182-7368; Solomon, Christopher/0000-0002-2850-4257; Hanson, Paul/0000-0001-8533-6061													1541-5856					JAN	2022	20	1					34	45		10.1002/lom3.10471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10471		DEC 2021											WOS:000726315700001

Lake Champlain 2010: A summary of recent research and monitoring initiatives	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Champlain shares a geological history with the Great Lakes and, as part of the St Lawrence drainage, also shares biological and ecological similarities. The complex bathymetry and extensive shoreline provide a variety of lacustrine habitats, from deep oligotrophic areas to shallow bays that are highly eutrophic. The large basin:lake ratio (19:1) makes Lake Champlain vulnerable to impacts associated with land use, and in some parts of the lake these impacts are further exacerbated by limited water exchange among lake segments due to both natural and anthropogenic barriers. Research in Lake Champlain and the surrounding basin has expanded considerably since the 1970s, with a particularly dramatic increase since the early 1990s. This special issue of the journal of Great Lakes Research brings together 16 reports from recent research and monitoring efforts in Lake Champlain. The papers cover a variety of topics but primarily focus on lake hydrodynamics; historical and recent chemical changes in the lake; phosphorus loading; recent changes in populations of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fishes; impacts of invasive species; recreational use; and the challenges of management decision-making in a lake that falls within the legal jurisdictions of two U.S. states, one Canadian province, two national governments, and the International Joint Commission. The papers provide not only evaluations of progress on some critical management issues but also valuable reference points for future research.

J	Momohara, A; Ito, A				Momohara, Arata; Ito, Ayano			Biogeographic and environmental history of Fagus and beech-dominant forest in Japan	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												There is a rich beech fossil record in Japan dating from the Paleogene to the Holocene, which allows for the continuous tracing of the evolutionary history of the genus and allows us to understand the environmental background that facilitated the genus to obtain a dominant state in present-day forests. In addition to the temperate climate, the oceanic climate was an important factor in controlling beech distribution and dominance in the forests in Japan. With the cooling climate, beech species began expanding their distribution in the Northern Hemisphere in the middle Eocene and appeared in Japan in the late middle Eocene. Beech species became dominant in forests in Japan during the Miocene along with the development of the oceanic climate by the opening of the Sea of Japan and with the strengthening of the monsoon. Fagus crenata appeared until the Late Pliocene and became dominant in forests in central Japan in the late Early Pleistocene coinciding with the onsetting inflow of the Tsushima Warm Current to the Sea of Japan in interglacial stages. During the full-glacial stages since the late Middle Pleistocene, the cold and dry climate caused by the strong winter monsoon limited the distribution of beeches into refugia at humid places, including the inland. During the deglaciation since ca 19 ka, the beech population began to grow and its distribution expanded, controlled by the development of the Tsushima Warm Current, as well as latitudinal and altitudinal temperature clines.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				MAR	2023	38	2					236	254		10.1111/1440-1703.12389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.12389		FEB 2023											WOS:000937023000001

Macrofossil evidence indicates a forest comprised primarily of conifers equivalent to the modem "rich conifer swamp" community, despite generally low regional abundance of these species in pollen records. Ages range from 7095 +/- 50 to 6420 +/- 70 C-14 yr BP, but the clustering of stump dates and the development of 2 floating tree-ring chronologies suggest a briefer forest interval of no more than c. 400 years. Dendrochronological analysis indicates an environment with high inter-annual climate variability. Stable-carbon isotope composition falls within the range of modem trees from this region, but the stable-oxygen composition is consistent with wanner conditions than today. Both our tree-ring and isotope data provide support for a warmer environment in this region, consistent with a mid-Holocene thermal maximum. This drowned forest also provides a dated elevation in the Nipissing transgression at about 6420 C-14 yr BP (7350 cal yr BP) in the southern Lake Huron basin, a few hundred years before reopening of the St. Clair River drainage.

The lake is under restoration treatment since 2006. At first, iron treatment was done for 2 years. In the second stage, spring water was directed into the hypolimnion in order to improve water oxygenation near the bottom sediments. The purpose of our research was to determine changes in the contribution of functional groups to the total number of taxa and total biomass of phytoplankton due to changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of the restored lake. Phytoplankton composition was analyzed in three periods: (1) before restoration; (2) during the first method of restoration; and (3) when the second method was implemented in the lake. Epilimnetic phytoplankton was sampled every year monthly from March to November. The relationship between phytoplankton groups and environmental factors (water temperature, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, dissolved phosphorus, conductivity and pH) was examined, using the canonical analyses. The redundancy analysis indicated that the temperature, dissolved phosphates concentration, ammonium nitrogen and pH were the main determining factors of the phytoplankton community dynamics. During the study, 13 coda dominated the phytoplankton biomass. Cyanobacteria of the codon H1 with such species as Aphanizomenon gracile, Dolichospermum planctonicum, D. viguieri dominated the phytoplankton community before restoration. S1 group consisting of Planktolyngbya limnetica, Limnothrix redekei and Planktothrix agardhii mostly dominated during the period in which the first method was used. Improvement of water quality due to restoration efforts in the third period caused dominance of other groups, especially J (Actinastrum hantzschii and other Chlorococcales), C (Asterionella formosa and other diatoms), Y (Cryptomonas marssonii and other cryptophytes), Lo (Peridiniopsis cunningtonii and other dinophytes) and X2 (Rhodomonas lacustris).					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018; Budzyńska, Agnieszka/AAC-6860-2020	Kozak, Anna/0000-0001-7448-0498; Budzynska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-4983-1940; Dondajewska-Pielka, Renata/0000-0002-6761-0669; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Kowalczewska-Madura, Katarzyna/0000-0003-0243-1085														2073-4441				FEB	2020	12	2							313	10.3390/w12020313	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12020313													WOS:000519846500005

On the Dependence of the ice Formation in the Lake Ladoga on the Air Temperature	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The purpose of the work was to establish regularities of the ice formation in the largest European Lake Ladoga depending on the air temperature. The average daily air temperatures obtained at the Sortavala weather station for thirty years were used for the analysis. The main task was to determine the sums of accumulated average daily air temperatures necessary for the appearance of primary ice phenomena in areas with different depths of the Lake. To solve this problem digitized remote sensing data of the spatial distribution of ice in the fixed cells with known average depth and data on average daily air temperatures were used. For thirty last winters, the dates of the first ice appearance in each of 180 cells were selected, which were related to the accumulated to this date sum of mean daily air temperatures after its steady transition through 0 & DEG;C towards the negative values. The resulting scheme of the accumulated sums of air temperatures needed for the ice appearance indicates their regular growth with increasing depth. It is assumed that this dependence will make it possible to assess dynamics of ice formation on other lakes.

However, the lack of GHG flux measurements and well-defined inland water areas for extrapolation, make the magnitude of the potential offset unclear. This study presents coordinated flux measurements of CH4 and CO2 in multiple lakes, ponds, rivers, open wells, reservoirs, springs, and canals in India. All these inland water types, representative of common aquatic ecosystems in India, emitted substantial amounts of CH4 and a major fraction also emitted CO2. The total CH4 flux (including ebullition and diffusion) from all the 45 systems ranged from 0.01 to 52.1mmolm(-2)d(-1), with a mean of 7.8 +/- 12.7 (mean +/- 1 SD) mmolm(-2)d(-1). The mean surface water CH4 concentration was 3.8 +/- 14.5m (range 0.03-92.1m). The CO2 fluxes ranged from -28.2 to 262.4mmolm(-2)d(-1) and the mean flux was 51.9 +/- 71.1mmolm(-2)d(-1). The mean partial pressure of CO2 was 2927 +/- 3269atm (range: 400-11467atm). Conservative extrapolation to whole India, considering the specific area of the different water types studied, yielded average emissions of 2.1 Tg CH(4)yr(-1) and 22.0 Tg CO(2)yr(-1) from India's inland waters. When expressed as CO2 equivalents, this amounts to 75 Tg CO2 equivalentsyr(-1) (53-98 Tg CO2 equivalentsyr(-1); +/- 1 SD)(,) with CH4 contributing 71%. Hence, average inland water GHG emissions, which were not previously considered, correspond to 42% (30-55%) of the estimated land carbon sink of India. Thereby this study illustrates the importance of considering inland water GHG exchange in large scale assessments.					arunachalam, lakshmanan/AAV-1073-2020; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019; Natchimuthu, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/0000-0002-9058-3048; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				NOV	2014	20	11					3397	3407		10.1111/gcb.12575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12575								24623552					WOS:000343762800010

Application of Weather Radar in Estimation of Bulk Atmospheric Deposition of Total Phosphorus Over Lake Simcoe	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												The decline of Lake Simcoe water quality has been attributed to high phosphor-us inputs that result in excessive algae and macrophyte growth subsequently contributing to end-of-summer hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen depletion and loss of fish habitat. Out of the estimated 53 to 67 tonne/annum (1998 to 2004 water years) of phosphorus entering the lake, atmospheric deposition is believed to be responsible for 16 to 38 tonne/annum. Historical estimates for atmospheric deposition involved averaging rain gauge (rainfall depth) and rain quality (phosphorus concentration) station data. Through use of this procedure, any spatial variability in the data (quality and quantity) is lost as each gauge is given an equal weighting. This study proposes a methodology to use Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) to spatially represent rainfall data and a method to correct radar-rainfall estimates to rainfall recorded by local rain gauges. From this analysis it was found that the radar generally represented localized rainfall well, with the majority of correlation coefficients (R-2) being over 0.90. Radar related issues that resulted in poor R-2 values included virga, overshooting beam, beam attenuation, range related issues and ground clutter. For large bulk atmospheric total phosphorus (TP) deposition events the dominant parameter in calculating TP loads was rainfall depth. Results from this analysis demonstrated a large (-88% to +44%) difference between historical and revised estimates of bulk atmospheric deposition of phosphorus over Lake Simcoe.

The cell number in each 1 cm layer of the sediment core was deduced through semi-quantification of the 16S rRNA gene copies by quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR). It was found that the total bacterial numbers remained relatively stable along the entire 59 cm sediment core. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments were performed to analyze the bacterial diversity over the entire column. Principle coordinates analysis suggested that the bacterial communities along the sediment core could be separated into three groups. There were obvious bacterial community shift among groups of 1-20 cm, 21-46 cm and 46-59 cm. Diversity indices indicated that the bacterial community in the 21-46 cm depth showed the highest species diversity and uniformity. The main bacterial groups in the sediments fell into 4 major lineages of the gram-negative bacteria: the alpha gamma, and delta subdivision of Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides, and some unknown sequences. The gram-positive bacteria Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were also detected. The results demonstrated the presence of highly diverse bacterial community population in the Antarctic lake sediment core. And the possible influence of climate and penguin population change on the bacterial community shift along the sediment core was discussed.

We assessed the stock of each morphologically distinguishable whitefish form (native lesser sparsely-rakered whitefish, native blue whitefish and stocked northern densely-rakered whitefish) in the Lake Oulujarvi during 1973-2014, and related temporal variations in population dynamics to environmental data and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data on other species having fisheries significance. The results demonstrated a synchronous major decline in the abundance of the native whitefish forms and a decline in the length-at-age of all forms. During the study period, summer time water temperature increased and surface water phosphorous concentration decreased. Recruitment in all whitefish forms showed Ricker-type dependence on spawning stock biomass but little residual correlation with the environmental parameters. Cross-correlation analyses suggested that the re-establishment of pikeperch Sander lucioperca population affected negatively both the recruitment and biomass of whitefish but the exact effect mechanisms require further assessment. Our results exemplify that ecosystem-based fisheries management in inland waters must take into account both natural and human-induced environmental changes as well as stockings, and that knowledge-based inland fisheries management is inherently data-intensive.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				DEC	2017	196						34	46		10.1016/j.fishres.2017.08.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.08.013													WOS:000412250000004

High altitude lakes (n = 48) were visited from July to August, 2008, to investigate the summer abundance and distribution of waterbirds. A total of 43,143 individuals of 49 waterbird species were recorded during our survey. Among them, the most abundant were Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus), followed by Brown-headed Gull (Larus brunnicephalus), Ruddy Shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and Great Black-headed Gull (L. ichthyaetus). These four species comprised 81.2% of all the waterbirds counted. A total of 12,796 Bar-headed Geese were counted at 39 lakes and comprised 29.6% of total birds counted. The lakes with greatest number of individuals were Dong, Rebang, Kunzhong, Yaduo, and Yueqia; the lakes with greatest species richness were Bangong, Dangreyong, Aiyong, Yaduo, and Zharinanmu, while the lakes with greatest bird species diversity were Dangreyong, Bangong, Kunzhong, and Aiyong. In addition, a total of 514 Black-necked Cranes (Grus nigricollis) were counted at 39 lakes, including 326 individuals in Nagqu Prefecture and 188 in Aili Prefecture. There were significant differences between the waterbird species, among the different salinities of the lakes and with the area of the lakes. The principal long-term threat to lakes in the Changtang region is wetland degradation, primarily from mineral exploitation.

For this purpose, we cored lakes Paladru and Moras (Rhone valley, France) and quantified sedimentary charcoal accumulation rate and fire frequency. To assess the role of climate and vegetation in paleofire activity, charcoal data were compared to vegetation dynamics based on pollen analyses and to climate reconstructions. The first increase in paleofire activity occurred at the beginning of the Bolling/Allerod Interstadial period (14,500 cal yr BP), synchronous with temperature and fire-prone vegetation increases. During the Younger Dryas, paleofire activity first decreased (12,600-12,200 cal yr BP) and then abruptly increased (12,200-11,600 cal yr BP). This change corresponds to a known climate partitioning that occurred during the Younger Dryas and implies that a sufficient quantity of biomass was available during the second period. At the beginning of the Holocene, fire activity remained high. This is in agreement with the increases in temperature and vegetation density. The change in forest composition since ca. 11,200 cal yr BP partly explains the decrease in paleofire activity, whereas warm climate conditions seem suitable for fire ignition and propagation.

J	Turner, F; Pott, R; Schwarz, A; Schwalb, A				Turner, Falko; Pott, Richard; Schwarz, Anja; Schwalb, Antje			Response of Pediastrum in German floodplain lakes to Late Glacial climate changes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Subfossil remains of the Pediastrum-algae group (Fam. Hydrodictyaceae) are frequently found in lake sediments, but very few studies have used them as palaeoclimate and palaeolimnological indicators. This study explored the species composition of Pediastrum assemblages in shallow floodplain lakes in northern Germany during two transitional periods from cold to temperate climate conditions (GS-2/GI-1 and GI-1/Holocene). We identified Pediastrum taxa to subspecies level and used multivariate statistics (constrained clustering, principal component analysis and redundancy analysis) to show that shifts in taxonomic composition reflected the strong Late Glacial climate oscillations. The Pediastrum assemblages indicate that climate amelioration already begun shortly before the main GS-2/GI-1 summer-temperature transition. In contrast to previous studies that identified trophic state as the main driver of change in Pediastrum species composition, we identified climate shifts and related factors as the major drivers of community change. Water depth and trophic state probably acted as secondary factors that were responsible for differences in Pediastrum response between the first and second investigated climate transitions. During cold periods, Pediastrum algae composition was controlled mainly by environmental variables, whereas during warm periods, Pediastrum assemblages may have been influenced to a greater extent by intra- and intergeneric competition. This study contributes to knowledge about ecological niches of Pediastrum species. Size-measurements on Pediastrum coenobia reveal that one response of Pediastrum algae to climate shifts probably was size change. Coenobia of Pseudopediastrum boryanum var. boryanum were significantly smaller during cold climate periods than during temperate periods. The shifts in Pediastrum species composition and coenobium size suggest this algae group has great potential for enabling palaeoecological and palaeoclimate inferences.

Topics dealing with the mitigation of C. raciborskii bloom is of great importance for toxins produced could threaten public health. The paper first investigated C. raciborskii dynamics over three years following sediment dredging in a shallow eutrophic Lake Dongqian (China). Based on rpoC1 gene copies, C. raciborskii bloom formed with average density of 1.30 x 10(6) cells/L on July 2009. One year later after sediment dredging, C. raciborskii cell density decreased below 1.17 x 10(5) cells/L or under detected limits during summer days on 2010. While two years later, the C. raciborskii bloom period was returned with markedly increased cell density reaching up to 4.15 x 10(7) cells/L on October 2011, and the maximum peak density was shown at 20.3 degrees C that was much lower than reported optimal growth temperature. Inferred from Spearman correlation analysis, linear regression showed C. raciborskii density was significant and positive with pH and SD, whereas they were significant and negative with TP and DO. Multiple regression analysis further demonstrated that TN, TP, SRP, pH and DO provided the best model and explained 53.1% of the variance in C. raciborskii dynamics. The approaches managing nutrients reduction might not control C. raciborskii bloom as extremely low TN (avg. 0.18 mg/L) and TP concentrations (avg. 0.05 mg/L) resulted in the highest C. raciborskii cell density after sediment dredging.

Genetic diversity analysis was performed with 11 ISSR markers. According to the results of the analysis, some genotypes formed two different populations as red and green. In addition, other genotypes were determined to consist of a mixture of these two populations. As a result of the data obtained, the total number of alleles was 7.64. Polymorphism was determined as 80.4% (polymorphic allele number 6.09). In the cluster analysis, two different groups were formed. There were 193 and 195 genotypes in the first group and other genotypes in the second group. In the dendrogram, the 193 and 195 genotypes are the furthest. The 21 and 22 genotypes were found to be closest. Although genotypes were taken from the same places, it was determined that they are different from each other. Molecular genetic data are thought to make an important contribution to future breeding studies.

Therefore it includes nutrients, algal biomass and composition as well as water transparency. A module describing the interaction between water and bottom gives the model the flexibility to deal with measures, such as a decrease of the external phosphorus loading and flushing with water differing in composition from the lake water. This paper focuses on the functional aspects of the model, the results of an application on Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands, and the implications for water management. With one set of coefficients DBS reproduces the most important characteristics of Lake Veluwe for a period of two years before measures (reduction of the external loading and flushing during the winter months) and eight years after the measures. The phosphorus concentration decreased and became growth limiting for algae instead of nitrogen and light. Both in measurements and modelling results, the algal composition changed from blue-green algae dominance to green algae and diatom dominance. Lake Veluwe had a relatively short transient phase after reduction of external loading, because high nitrate concentrations in the flushing water inhibited a long period with high phosphorus releases from the bottom. Model calculations were carried out to investigate the effects of fish stock management and optimization of flushing. Both measures are promising.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 25	1994	275						479	492		10.1007/BF00026736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026736													WOS:A1994NB19800043
J	Engalychev, SY; Makkaveev, AN				Engalychev, S. Yu.; Makkaveev, A. N.			Impact Crater Lakes of the European Part of Russia	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The origin of a number of impact formations (astroblemes), including lake depressions in the European part of Russia, is unknown. Many of them are very ancient, having arisen many millions of years ago. They are hidden under the sequences of rocks accumulated after the lake formation and are not visible on the surface of the Earth. The crater lakes are only "hypothesized" on satellite images or in the pattern of a river network. Among these are Kaluga, Karla, Kursk, Gagarin (Gzhatsk), and one of the largest meteorite craters on our planet, Puchezh-Katunki, with a diameter of almost 80 km. These lakes, and even the largest ones, can only be detected by geological methods, and they cannot always be unambiguously attributed to astroblemes. The only ancient crater found in the European part of Russia that is not hidden under the thickness of rocks is located in Karelia. It is occupied by Janisjarvi Lake. To date, there is evidence that the depressions of Smerdyachye, Svetloyar, and Rabiga Kul lakes are "young" (formed in the Holocene) meteorite craters. Morphological signs of the meteorite origin for such lakes are supported by the presence of an asymmetrical uplifted rim surrounding them with steep inner slopes facing the depression and gentle outer slopes. In the structure of the uplifted rim, there are fragments of rocks that have been ejected from the depression during the impact of a meteorite as well as impactites-fragments of rocks cemented by a glassy mass, with melted grains of quartz, feldspar, and zircon. The underlying sediments of the uplifted rims are deformed as a result of their squeezing from the center of the crater by the blast wave and crushing. The depth of such lakes is abnormally deep compared to neighboring lakes. The most studied lake of this type is Smerdyachye Lake located 140 km southeast of Moscow. The meteorite fell not earlier than not earlier than 9-10 ka BP. The appearance and structure of the lake depression combine the features of a meteorite crater and a karst depression. When the meteorite collided with the Earth's surface, the crater was formed and deep-lying soluble carbonate rocks were opened. The lake that arose in the crater began to develop as a karst lake. Svetloyar Lake (Nizhny Novgorod oblast) is widely known thanks to the legend of the "invisible city of Kitezh," which once sank to the bottom of the lake. The hills bordering the lake on the south side are composed of deformed Triassic clayey sediments. On the slopes of the hills, there are fragments of the Permian rocks 3-3.2 ka BP, ejected from a depth of at least 70 m during the impact of a meteorite on the Earth. Rabiga Kul Lake is located at the confluence of the Volga and Kama. The depth of the depression from the crest of uplifted rims to its bottom is up to 37 m. The age of the meteorite fall does not exceed 15 ka.																			1028-334X	1531-8354				DEC	2024	519	SUPPL1		S			S169	S177		10.1134/S1028334X24604851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1028334X24604851													WOS:001442563300008

Its origin is based on a large landslide that produced the rock displacement during the summer of 1991. The morphometric parameters for landslide were extracted from digital terrain model (DTM) and orthophoto plans (Ed. 2012, 2010 and 2006) using GIS software (ArcGIS, Global Mapper and TNTMips). In order to determine the morpho-bathymetric parameters of the lake basin, direct methods were used: Dual Frequency Echo Sounder for bathymetric survey and Leica System 1200 (TCR 1201 and GPS 1200) for aquatic surfaces and shorelines. From measurements made over the entire surface of the lake between 2011 and 2014, approx. 45,000 bathymetric levels resulted, on which several digital elevation models were conducted of the lacustrine depression with 0.25 m/pixel resolution (DEM 2011 and DEM 2014). The bathymetric maps results were used to determine the morphometric (aquatic surface or water mirror surface, length and width of the lake, lake major axis and minor axis, and perimeter or length of shoreline) and bathymetric parameters (actual shape of lacustrine basin, average and maximum depth, average slope of the lake bottom, water volume expressed as the total or partial volumes).

Vegetation during UMBI and deposition of Tuff IF at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (ca. 1.8 Ma) based on phytoliths and plant remains	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												As part of ongoing research at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, to determine the detailed paleoenvironmental setting during Bed I and Bed II times and occupation of the basin by early hominins, we present the results of phytolith analyses of Tuff IF which is the uppermost unit of Bed I. Phytoliths were identified in most of the levels and localities on the eastern paleolake margin, but there are not always sufficient numbers of identifiable morphologies to infer the specific type of vegetation due to dissolution. Some surge surfaces and reworked tuff surfaces were vegetated between successive ash falls, as indicated by root-markings and the presence of a variety of phytolith morphotypes. Dicotyledonous wood/bark types were dominant except at the FLK N site just above Tuff IF when monocots are dominant and for the palm-dominated sample from the reworked channel cutting down into Tuff IF at FLK N. The area between the two fault scarps bounding the HWK Compartment, approximately 1 km wide, was vegetated at various time intervals between some of the surges and during the reworking of the Tuff. By lowermost Bed II times the eastern margin was fully vegetated again. Climate and tectonic activity probably controlled the fluctuating lake levels but locally the paleorelief and drainage were probably the controlling factors for the vegetation changes. These data support a scenario of small groups of hominins making brief visits to the paleolake during uppermost Bed I times, followed by a more desirable vegetative environment during lowermost Bed II times.

During the warm seasons, when these mats were fully developed, analyses of microbial activities and microprofiles of oxygen and sulfide have shown a great activity of the different kinds of bacteria found in the mat below the gypsum crust. Oxygen production could amount to 2 mu mol cm(-3) h(-1) during the maximum daylight whereas the oxidation of sulfide in the light was calculated to be 12.7 mu mol cm(-3) h(-1), i.e. 300 to 180 mmol m(-2) day-l assuming 8-10 hours of constant daylight and a sulfide oxidation zone of 3 mm in thickness. This sulfide oxidation consumes about 65-95% of the diel sulfide production which has been estimated to be 400 to 450 mmol m(-2) day-l originating from sulfate reduction which takes place in the 6 cm depth horizon of sediment plus mat. According to the amounts of sulfate precipitated at the sediment surface in the form of gypsum, sulfate reduction is never limited and was found to be among the highest values reported in the literature (average value of 8200 nmols cm(-3) day(-1)). Completely covered by the gypsum crust, this ecosystem has been found to react as a closed system. Consequently, the sulfide does not escape and accumulate below the crust. It was detected up to the top of the mat after a few hours of darkness. It is reoxidized during the day by the photosynthetic organisms that form the mats. These latter mats were composed of 2 to 3 laminated layers of phototrophic organisms: an upper brown layer of the cyanobacterium Aphanothece, an intermediate green layer of the cyanobacterium Phormidium and an underlying red layer of purple sulfur-oxidizing bacteria from which two new halophilic species were isolated (Chromatium salexigens and Thiocapsa halophila). It has been found that the accumulated sulfide is oxidized not only by the phototrophic bacteria in the sulfide oxidation zone but also by the oxygen produced by the cyanobacteria which are able to photosynthesize in the presence of sulfide.																			0168-6496					MAR	1994	13	4					273	286		10.1016/0168-6496(94)90065-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-6496(94)90065-5													WOS:A1994NB49500004

In and around the Keszthely Bay where the amount of organic material is high, the density of mussels is several times higher than in any other place (1.2-7.3 ind. m-2 between 1966-1970). The biomass of Unionidae is also higher in the Keszthely Bay. The biomass without the shell was between 0.44-1.33g dry weight m-2 in 1966-1968. The number of Unionidae dramatically declined since 1970. They were only found in the Keszthely Bay after that in low numbers (1.2 ind. m-2). The growth of Unio tumidus RETZIUS is very slow in Lake Balaton, therefore its production is very low. The calculated weight gain is 15 % for the shell biomass, and 11 % for the soft parts in the period between May-November. The rate of production is highest in the middle of summer. Based on the population density between 1966-1968, the production of the Unionidae family in the Keszthely Bay is 17 mg m-2 year-1. This value is around 0.1 in other parts of the lake.																			0003-9136					AUG	1992	125	2					245	251																WOS:A1992JM47300007

Higher salinity levels of Bosten Lake were reconstructed from assemblages, the stable isotope composition and Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios of ostracod shells between similar to 7800 and 5600 cal a BP. A period of low and moderate salinities between similar to 5600 and 4900 cal a BP was followed by the re-establishment of higher salinities between similar to 4900 and 4300 cal a BP. Since then, Bosten Lake has recorded fluctuating conditions with a number of multi-centennial phases of low and moderate salinities. Although the salinity-lake level relationship of Bosten Lake is not fully understood, a higher salinity at the core site seems to correspond to periods of higher lake levels. This contradictory interpretation is explained tentatively by the changing distance of the core site to the freshwater-providing river mouth with changing lake levels and potentially resulting lateral shifts of the salinity-distribution pattern within the lake. Assuming this explanation is correct, the record from Bosten Lake reflects higher moisture availability and a strong climatic influence of the Indian Monsoon in the early mid-Holocene until about 4000 cal a BP, and more unstable drier conditions susceptible to minor changes in the regional circulation patterns and temperature variations afterwards.

J	Zohary, T; Pollingher, U; Hadas, O; Hambright, KD				Zohary, T; Pollingher, U; Hadas, O; Hambright, KD			Bloom dynamics and sedimentation of Peridinium gatunense in Lake Kinneret	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Temporal changes in the abundance of Peridinium gatunense Nygaard in the water column of warm monomictic Lake Kinneret were followed during 1990-1994. Sedimentation rates of this dinoflagellate were followed concurrently by means of sediment traps with and without a preservative (Formalin), positioned at the base of the epilimnion and within the hypolimnion, for exposure periods of 2-3 weeks. Upper trap catches of total P. gatunense (live cells + dead cells + thecae + protoplasts + cysts) were nearly always higher than lower trap catches, partly due to decomposition of the cells as they sank through the water column. Over the 5-year period, total P. gatunense sedimentation rates ranged over 4 orders of magnitude, from values <0.001 to 8.5 g (WW) m(-2) d(-1). A typical seasonal pattern was observed in which sedimentation rates were relatively low during the bloom increase phase, with thecae (from cell, division) being the main component, and increased substantially after the peak of the bloom, when the relative contribution of senescent cells, dead cells and protoplasts increased substantially. Cysts were trapped in low numbers, usually 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer than live cells. Interannual variations in total P. gatunense sedimentation were large and independent of the size of bloom-the proportion of annual P. gatunense production reaching the hypolimnetic traps ranged from 6% in 1994, the year with the largest bloom, to 68% in 1991, a year with an average-size bloom. The high value was exceptional and we speculated that it resulted from higher resuspension and more severe nutrient limitation of microbial decomposition during that low water level, drought year. On average, thecae accounted for 75% of total P. gatunense sedimentation despite being only 55% of the P. gatunense-produced biomass, suggesting that thecae were more refractory or less grazed than protoplasts. Thecal C:N:P ratio of >3,000:19:1 (vs. 276:51:1 for protoplasts) indicated that microbial decomposition of thecae is likely to require N and P inputs from other sources. Ultimately, our study highlights for the first time that annual dinoflagellate sedimentation rates may vary dramatically as a result of other processes such as decomposition, resuspension, and grazing, leading to dramatic variations in the amount of organic matter reaching the bottom sediments.					; Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012	Hambright, K.

This study evaluates the long-term effectiveness of a trait-informed harvest regulation combining reduced daily bag limits with weight-based harvest caps on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations in eight unstocked, oligotrophic lakes in Newfoundland, Canada. Over 15 years (1994-2008), standardized index netting and winter creel surveys were used to assess changes in fish size structure and angler behaviour. Mixed-effects models revealed significant increases in maximum length (Lmax), mean length at capture (Lc), and proportional size distribution (PSD) following regulation implementation, with no significant changes in catch rate, effort, or release rate. We applied a variance partitioning framework to identify mechanisms driving PSD improvements, attributing 31 % of PSD variation to growth, 18 % to recruitment, and 7 % to exploitation. These findings demonstrate that biologically grounded regulations can enhance fishery quality while maintaining angler engagement. The study offers one of the first empirical demonstrations of PSD driver partitioning in a wild brook trout fishery. It provides evidence to support adaptive, trait-informed management in recreational salmonid systems.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				AUG	2025	288								107471	10.1016/j.fishres.2025.107471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2025.107471													WOS:001538826600001

We analyzed the pollen, diatom, and weak acid-leachable fractions associated with extracted organic compounds of lacustrine sediments retrieved from the subalpine Retreat Lake in northwestern Taiwan. During the early Holocene (10,100-8600 cal BP), cool climate was inferred by the dominance of grass pollen with poor preservation of diatom valves in the record. At that time, derived biomarkers were also dominated by long-chain alkanes originating from herbs. The following Holocene Optimum (8600-6400 cal BP) was characterized by a remarkable increase of tree pollen, indicating the warmer and humid climate and a stronger summer EAM. The possible enhanced monsoon-driven precipitation resulted in higher contents of total organic carbon buried in sediments. However, the climate and precipitation of the alpine area in Taiwan might have been unstable. The high variability of wetland pollen and diatom abundance reveals weak periods of EAM during the late Holocene Optimum (6400-4500 cal BP). The hiatus in the deposit during 4500-2100 cal BP suggests the continuously decline of the EAM. During the last 2100 years, dominated wetland plant pollen accompanying stable diatom abundance indicated humid climatic conditions and a stable increase of the EAM. The climatic condition of study area was similar with modern situation during this late Holocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The rate of natural and man-induced ecological changes in these landscapes is a function of the structural and functional characteristics of the component ecosystems. Analyzing spatial patterns and detecting fragile areas are thus crucial for making previsions about the chance and rate of disturbance propagation within and between the ecosystems. In this study we have tested the hypothesis of occurrence of a relationship between the extent of temporal change and spatial heterogeneity of mixed forested areas in the watershed of two Italian volcanic lakes by using remotely sensed data. Landsat images were acquired in summer 1987, 1992 and 2000, when Nature Reserves were established, and the temporal variation in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was determined by the change detection analysis. To analyze the spatial variability of NDVI, semivariograms were calculated using data from five randomly chosen forested areas (10 km(2)-wide) per watershed. Results show that NDVI varied greatly across the two study sites and most of the variation was spatially structured. NDVI varied also over time. A linear positive relationship was observed between the number of pixels changing between dates and the semivariogram range, as the maximum distance of spatial dependence estimated from the starting NDVI image. Spatial homogeneity of NDVI is thus suggested as an indicator of intrinsic fragility (i.e. susceptibility to change) of mixed forests and the semivariogram range as a rapid estimator that can be considered by forest managers and agencies.

A phytoplankton survey, carried out monthly in the brackish and shallow Biviere di Gela, in 2005-2007, revealed a transformation in the structure of its phytoplankton assemblage as compared with similar data collected in 1987-1988. An analysis of the trends followed by precipitation and temperature over the last 40 years, showed reduced water inflows, due to increased air temperature and evapotranspiration rather than to a decrease in the amount of precipitation. A consequent reduction in water level occurred, which almost caused the disappearing of the lake at the beginning of the century. This reduction in water level disrupted the littoral zone of the lake and transformed it from a clear, macrophyte-dominated environment to a turbid one characterized by huge summer blooms of the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, and Pseudanabaena limnetica. The addition of freshwater from a nearby dam reservoir, to restore water levels, likely opened the way to another alga, Prymnesium parvum, whose allelopathic and toxic glycosides further contributed to the transformation of the lake biota. On the whole, the Biviere di Gela is an example of how climate changes, coupled with inadequate management procedures, may negatively impact Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems.					; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008	BARONE, Rossella/0000-0001-5777-0688; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2010	639	1					43	53		10.1007/s10750-009-0016-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0016-2													WOS:000273447500005
J	Zhang, WS; Li, HP; Pueppke, SG; Pang, JP				Zhang, Wangshou; Li, Hengpeng; Pueppke, Steven G.; Pang, Jiaping			Restored riverine wetlands in a headwater stream can simultaneously behave as sinks of N2O and hotspots of CH4 production	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Wetlands can improve water quality, but they are also recognized as important sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Emissions of these gases from wetland ecosystems, especially those in headwaters, are poorly understood. Here, we determined monthly concentrations of dissolved N2O and CH4 in a headwater stream of the Taihu Lake basin of China that contains both wetland and non-wetland reaches. Daily GHG dynamics in the wetland reach were also investigated. Riverine N2O and CH4 concentrations generally varied within 10-30 nmol L-1 and 0.1 -1.5 mu mol L-1, respectively. CH4 saturation levels in the wetland reach were about seven times higher than those in the non-wetland reach, but there was no difference in N2O saturation. In the wetland reach, saturation levels of CH4 peaked in July, coincident with a dip in N2O saturation to levels below its saturated solubility. This underscores that hotspots of CH4 production and sinks for N 2 0 can occur occasionally in wetlands in mid-summer, when vegetative growth and microbial activities are high. Diurnal measurements indicated that CH4 saturation in water flows passing through the wetlands from midnight through the early morning can surge to levels 10 times higher than those detected at other times of the day. Simultaneously, saturation levels of N2O decreased by 75%, indicating a net consumption of N2O. Changes in nutrient supply determined by upstream inflows, as well as dissolved oxygen, pH, and other environmental factors mediated by the wetlands, correlate with the differentiated behavior of N2O and CH4 production in wetlands. Additional work will be necessary to confirm the roles of these factors in regulating GHG emissions in riverine wetlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High-resolution pollen records provided detailed information on the vegetation response to climate change. The Thalictrum pollen percentage, which corresponded to the magnetic susceptibility data, and the first principal component of principal-component analysis of pollen data were good indicators of the orbital-and millennial-scale dry/wet cycle in the study area. Hanon pollen and magnetic susceptibility records suggested that colder and drier conditions were prevalent between 25.2 and 17.6k cal a BP in the study area due to a precession-induced decrease in summer insolation. Hanon multi-proxy data were correlated with oxygen isotope records from Greenland and Hulu cave, suggesting the possible teleconnection of millennial-scale climate oscillations between North Atlantic and East Asian regions. According to our results, Heinrich-like cold events probably occurred around 31.1, 25.2 and 16.7k cal a BP, and the warm intervals observed around 30.7 and 29.9k cal a BP may have corresponded to Dansgaard-Oeschger warm events 4 and 3, respectively.

In total, 334 species from at least 117 genera were found. 210 species (98 genera) occurred in the Arctic (Svalbard, 79degrees N), 120 spp. (73 genera) in the maritime Antarctic (Livingston Island, 63degreesS) and 59 spp. (41 genera) in the continental Antarctic (Victoria Land, 75degreesS). In Antarctica, however, freshwater ciliate communities are distinctly depauperized compared to those in the Arctic and species diversity decreases by about 5 spp./degrees latitude southwards, i.e. environmental conditions become more severe. While Litostomatea and Stichotrichia together comprised more than 40% of the species in all regions, a higher proportion of nassophorean (14%) and scuticociliate species (12%) occurred in the climatically more extreme Victoria Land than in the other locations. No colpodids were found in Victoria Land samples, while 9-12 species were found in Arctic and maritime Antarctic inland waters. Some genera, e.g.. Stentor, Trithigmostoma, as well as mixotrophic species were widespread in the Arctic but not found in the maritime or continental Antarctic, but cyanobacterivores reached their highest proportion (13%) furthest south. Comparisons with the ciliate faunas of terrestrial and marine biotopes showed that a separate limnetic coenosis exists in both polar regions.																			0932-4739					DEC	2003	39	4					491	494		10.1078/0932-4739-00026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/0932-4739-00026													WOS:000220045600026

We here report two events related to C. furcoides distribution expansion in Uruguay: (1) the main environmental drivers (physical and chemical factors, extreme wind events and zooplankton composition) of the first appearance and bloom of C. furcoides in 2012 in a subtropical eutrophic shallow lake (Lake Blanca, Uruguay); and (2) a fish kill event of Prochilodus lineatus observed during a bloom of C. furcoides in 2016 in a deep eutrophic lake (Puente de las Americas, Uruguay). The bloom of C. furcoides in Lake Blanca started in spring 2012 (December) after a clear water period with high phytoplankton species replacement after a cyanobacterial bloom of Raphidiopsis raciborskii. Extreme wind during this period may have initiated the bloom of C. furcoides by enhanced cysts resuspension from the sediments. High nutrient availability and low zooplankton grazing, further allowed C. furcoides to expand and reach over 96% of the phytoplankton biomass. In Lake Puente de las Americas, we registered the fish kill of the large-sized benthic Prochilodus lineatus during a bloom of C. furcoides. This bloom caused the oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion and the gills from these fish exhibited massive accumulations of C. furcoides cells compared to the ones collected in non-bloom conditions. Concurring to other studies our results suggest that the C. furcoides bloom likely caused the fish kill of P. lineatus by asphyxia. Our study is the earliest register of a bloom of C. furcoides in Uruguay (in 2012) and discusses the potential environmental effects of its bloom in subtropical lakes.

This legislation calls for bacterial monitoring of recreational waters along the U.S. coastline, including the Great Lakes. The State of Wisconsin implemented this legislation in summer 2003, triggering extensive microbial monitoring of Lake Superior beaches. E. coli were measured at 27 beaches along Lake Superior, Wisconsin by defined substrate analysis. While E. coli concentrations were relatively low at these "cold water" beaches, monitoring did result in a few swimming advisories and beach closures (0.8% of total samples collected had E. coli concentrations that exceeded standards). Increasing water temperatures were not associated with increasing concentrations of bacterial contaminants. Location of sampling site and depth of water at the location where samples were taken did have an effect on detection of E. coli Greater E. coli levels consistently were detected in shallower water and varied depending on the location of the sampling site horizontally across the beach. These findings support the notion that the concentration of E. coli in chest deep water may not be representative of E. coli concentrations in shallower water, closer to shore.																			0380-1330						2005	31	1					116	121		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70243-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70243-4													WOS:000230145500011

These investigations have revealed sedimentary evidence of the Yoldia Sea regression, the Ancient Lake Vattern transgression, and the following stepwise river formation process. Around 9000 cal BC, two small kettlehole basins at Strandvagen and Kanaljorden became isolated from the Baltic basin. As the ice sheet retreated further north, the isostatic uplift isolated the Vattern basin from the Baltic basin. Due to the uneven isostatic uplift, the basin tilted toward the south, and the Ancient Lake Vattern transgression started in Motala. The threshold in Motala at 92.5 m a.s.l. was reached around 7200 cal BC, and River Motala Strom was formed.C-14-dated diatom records from Lake Boren, and shoreline deposits in Motala, confirm this event. The water level in Lake Vattern initially fell around 1.5 m, and around 5800 cal BC, a second erosional event cut down the threshold to modern day level. At this time, the Late Mesolithic settlements in Motala were established and expanded.

The first river ( Green River) was initially divided into three zones ( impounded, transitional, erosional) according to hydrological characteristics. The entire reach of the second river (Nolin River) was a regime unit. Only the Green River erosional zone was free-flowing with a linear sequence of riffle-run-pool reaches. A detrended correspondence analysis showed that the Green River impounded and transitional zones were taxonomically indistinguishable while the Green River erosional zone and the Nolin River were each distinct. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed that higher surface velocity, higher summer water temperatures and more turbid conditions, and lower water temperatures were contributing parameters to the separation of the Green River erosional zone, Green River transitional/impounded zones, and the Nolin River, respectively, in ordination space. A series of one-way ANOVA's testing for differences of macroinvertebrates assemblages between the three Green River zones according to five metrics showed that the Green River erosional zone demonstrated significantly higher values and the transitional and impounded zones were ecologically similar.																			0018-8158					JUN	2004	520	1-3					19	28		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027722.23374.dc	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027722.23374.dc													WOS:000221391900003

The 30 day maximum geometric mean of 200 faecal coliforms per 100 mL of water recommended as the acceptable maximum limit in the 1983 Guidelines for Canadian Recreational Water for bather protection was achieved by beaches in all three geographic regions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) criterion of 126 Escherichia coli per 100 mL of water was satisfied by the beaches in the Whiteshell area and the east side of Lake Winnipeg, but not by beaches on the west side of Lake Winnipeg. The USEPA criterion of 33 enterococci per 100 mL, as well as enterococcus criteria proposed for Manitoba were not met by most beaches in all three regions. Before recommending changes to the national guidelines for recreational water quality (i.e. adding enterococci criteria), it is important to document an association between illness and counts of a specific indicator bacteria, standardize the test procedures for this bacteria and to agree on the bacterial counts that would relate to an acceptable risk to bathers.																			0008-4263	1920-7476				MAY-JUN	1987	78	3					181	184											3607696					WOS:A1987J260400010

Several large outbreaks were recorded in 1995, 2002, and 2012. We analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory, and virological characteristics of HFRS cases detected in three geographically close natural foci (Ogulin, Slunj, and the Plitvice Lakes surroundings) during the 2014 outbreak. Methodology: From January to December 2014, 122 patients with suspected HFRS were tested for hantavirus IgM/IgG antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Cross-reactive samples were further tested using a western blot (WB). For hospitalized patients from Ogulin area, clinical and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: Acute infection was documented in 57 (46.7%) patients, of whom 75.4% were hospitalized. Ten (8.2%) patients were found to be IgG seropositive. Patients were 15-69 years of age and predominantly male (74.5%). The outbreak started in winter months, with most cases recorded from May to July (80.7%). The most frequently reported symptoms were fever (96.3%), chills/shivering (62.9%), and lumbar pain (48.1%). Mild clinical form was found in 66.7% patients, moderate in 18.5%, and severe in 14.8% patients (all but one infected with PUUV). One patient died. Using IFA, 48.8% patients showed monotypic antibody response, while in 51.2%, cross-reactive antibodies were found. PUUV was confirmed in 94.7% and DOBV in 5.3% HFRS cases by WB. Conclusions: Central mountainous Croatian regions are still highly endemic areas for HFRS. A higher percentage of severe PUUV infections could be at least partly associated with a patient's immune status.

Aquatic ecosystem models are useful tools for understanding dynamics of lakes, however, there are few examples of these models being applied to subalpine lakes, which may differ from temperate lakes in dimensions such as physical setting and ecology. Here we apply the aquatic ecosystem model AQUATOX to the Loch, a well-studied lake in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, USA, to assess the applicability of this model to a subalpine lake setting, and to identify modeling gaps. We found that AQUATOX could represent phytoplankton dynamics during the ice-off period. Attempting to calibrate the model during the ice-on period using the same structure and parameters as the ice-off period underestimated winter chlorophyll a concentrations. Additionally, the model was used to simulate a nutrient bioassay experiment - nitrate was well simulated; P was overestimated but consistent with the observed pattern. These results support the use of current models for subalpine lakes when data are sufficient. Areas identified for future model development include better models for boundary conditions, improved light data, modeling of mixotrophy, and better representation of ice formation and under-ice stratification.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				AUG	2025	507								111172	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2025.111172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2025.111172		MAY 2025						40547815					WOS:001491127600001

During the summer of 1991, the LMAQR states sponsored the Lake Michigan Ozone Study, which included a comprehensive field measurement program to gather data to understand the complex meteorology and air quality of that region and to verify predictions from air quality models. Air quality and meteorological data were collected by aircraft, surface monitors, rawinsondes, and radar wind profilers to characterize pollutant distributions and understand transport regimes. The unique meteorology of the LMAQR and the stable conditions over the lake produce several transport regimes. This paper presents observations of these transport regimes on two days with maximum surface ozone concentrations above 160 ppb in Wisconsin and Michigan. Transport of air with the highest ozone concentrations occurred in a conduction layer, which is a shallow layer of cool air over Lake Michigan. The conduction layer provided a stable environment where morning emissions remained concentrated and allowed reaction at high precursor concentrations. Southerly and southwesterly winds transported pollutants in this layer northward. Eventually this air flowed onshore and produced many nearshore ozone exceedances along the Wisconsin and Michigan shorelines. To successfully model ozone in the LMAQR, meteorological and air quality models must simulate these transport processes and stable conditions over the lake.																			0894-8763					AUG	1995	34	8					1877	1889		10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<1877:OOTPFO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<1877:OOTPFO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995RL45500011

It is therefore a nice prototype to study the natural and/or anthropogenic influences on the arsenic geochemistry of the sediment in highland lakes. In this study, lacustrine sediments were recovered from the lake and the differences in the occurrence of arsenic between the surface (0-10 cm depth) and sub-surface sediments (>20 cm) were investigated. The arsenic distribution in the sub-surface sediment was in accordance with the locations of springs, suggesting that arsenic therein was affected by groundwater. The surface sediment, however, was affected by human contamination carried by Yangzong River. In the sub-surface sediment, arsenic concentrations increased with pH values but decreased with redox potentials. Higher grain sizes corresponded to lower arsenic contents. Arsenic was strongly positively correlated with Sb and Bi due to their similar geochemical behaviors. In the surface sediment, however, the human activities increased the arsenic concentration in the sediment and weakened the correlations between arsenic occurrence, pH/Eh values, grain size, and trace metals. Although the average differences in the trace element concentrations between surface and sub-surface sediments over the entire Yangzonghai Lake were less than 15 %, the pairwise differences were statistically significant, and the southern portion of the lake showed the greatest anthropogenic influence. This research will provide important information on the geochemistry and environmental science of arsenic in fault-controlled highland lakes.

J	JONES, MB; MUTHURI, FM				JONES, MB; MUTHURI, FM			THE DIURNAL COURSE OF PLANT WATER POTENTIAL, STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE AND TRANSPIRATION IN A PAPYRUS (CYPERUS-PAPYRUS L) CANOPY	OECOLOGIA												The diurnal course of water potential, stomatal conductance and transpiration was measured on mature umbels (the major evaporating surface) of papyrus (C. papyrus L.) growing in a fringing swamp on Lake Naivasha, Kenya. Umbel water potential declined only slightly during the morning but fell rapidly after midday to a minimum value of -1.5 MPa [pascal] in early afternoon. The 2 main structures forming the umbels, the bracteoles and rays showed similar patterns of change of stomatal conductance throughout the day. The values of conductance indicate major stomatal opening during the morning, partial midday closure and some recovery of opening during the afternoon. The increase in water vapor pressure deficit of the air may be the major cause of the midday closure of the stomata and plant water potential has little effect. Why transpiration is reduced at high vapor pressure deficits when water is freely available to the roots is not clear. It is speculated that the restricted water movement into the plant from the anaerobic root environment has the effect of reducing the uptake of toxic ferrous iron. The daily total of canopy transpiration is estimated to be 12.5 mm, twice the value previously reported for papyrus but similar to daily values determined for other wetland communities.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1984	63	2					252	255		10.1007/BF00379885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00379885								28311021					WOS:A1984TF76800016

BIOMASS ON EUTROPHICATION IN BAIYANGDIAN LAKE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Aiming at improving water quality by avoiding eutrophication in Baiyangdian Lake, excessive growth of CLP (Potamogeton crispus) was treated by partial harvesting in spring, by means of an enclosure experiment. CLP was harvested in different proportions and water quality was monitored weekly for 46 days. TN concentrations and total bacterial counts reached a maximum on day 24 post harvest, after which they declined sharply. TP concentrations decreased first and then increased gradually. The highest values appeared in water without any CLP and also in plots where the maximum biomass had not been removed. In contrast, plots in which 20% of the biomass had been retained resulted in lowest TN and TP values. COD concentrations increased in mid-to-late May and this correlated with an increase of biomass. TLI of each treatment peaked at the end of May, and reached highest values in mid-June. The highest TLI value appeared in water without any CLP. The water of plots retaining 20% of maximum biomass resulted in medium nutrition levels, while the other treatments reached TLI levels indicative of light eutrophication. The best harvest time for CLP is mid-May and the best harvest rate, as suggested by this study, is approximately 80% of maximum biomass.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2016	14	4					577	587		10.15666/aeer/1404_577587	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1404_577587													WOS:000387850600037
J	Rodrigo, MA; Rojo, C; Alonso-Guillén, JL; Vera, P				Rodrigo, Maria A.; Rojo, Carmen; Alonso-Guillen, Jose L.; Vera, Pablo			Restoration of two small Mediterranean lagoons: The dynamics of submerged macrophytes and factors that affect the success of revegetation	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Two small, shallow lagoons newly created from former rice fields in the Mediterranean coast (Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, Spain) were restored by planting several species of submerged macrophytes (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton spp., Zannichellia peltata and Ranunculus peltatus) in 2008. Charophytes also appeared spontaneously. M. spicatum was the species that dominated both lagoons and almost completely covered their surface. M. spicatum reached a high biomass and displayed a seasonal pattern, declining during the cold season and reappearing in the spring. No submerged vegetation was observed in the lagoons from 2011 onward. The major purpose of the present study was to elucidate the factors that caused the total disappearance and prevented the regeneration of submerged vegetation cover in both lagoons. Such factors may include negative biotic relationships such as those related to the presence of fish and crayfish, waterfowl grazing, phytoplankton and epiphytic development that causes shading and abiotic factors such as water nutrient concentration. Three different types (treatments) of 1-m(2). exclosures were set up and planted with macrophyte cultures that formed 3 different assemblages: Chara hispida alone, a mixture of C vulgaris, C baltica and Nitella hyalina and a mixture of higher plants (M. spicatum, C demersum and Potamogeton pectinatus). The "Open" type of exclosure permitted the entrance of fish, crayfish, and birds. The "Lateral" exclosure prevented the entry of fish. The "Closed" exclosure also prevented bird grazing. To determine the potential of the seed sediment bank to regenerate submerged vegetation, we investigated lagoon sediments (i) to quantify seeds and (ii) to examine seed germination. The results indicate that there is not a sufficiently large reservoir of phanerogam seeds in the lagoon sediments to recover vegetation by germination. The "Closed" exclosures allowed the growth of all species in spite of the intense development of periphyton on macrophyte tissues and filamentous algae, which reduced light availability by up to 45%. The "Lateral" exclosures had a lower development of macrophytes. In the "Open" exclosures, almost no macrophytes were detected 3 weeks after planting. Water chemistry (P and N content) did not limit the development of the tested macrophyte species but did appear to negatively affect charophytes in one of the lagoons. The deleterious effect of exotic fauna (particularly carps and crayfish) in combination with the high herbivory pressure by waterfowl, primarily during the periods when the rice fields surrounding the lagoons were dry, were the major factors that acted in a negative synergistic manner to prevent the recolonisation of the vegetation currently in the lagoons. A procedure to eradicate exotic fish and crayfish is required prior to any type of restoration effort involving the plantation of submerged macrophytes. More areas with permanent submerged vegetation in the Natural Park are required to decrease herbivory pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	OLIVER, JS; GRAHAM, RW				OLIVER, JS; GRAHAM, RW			A CATASTROPHIC KILL OF ICE-TRAPPED COOTS - TIME-AVERAGED VERSUS SCAVENGER-SPECIFIC DISARTICULATION PATTERNS	PALEOBIOLOGY												More than 300 coots (Fulica americana) became frozen in Spring Lake, Tazewell County, Illinois, on December 1, 1985. This catastrophic event permitted 8 weeks of taphonomic observations, which showed that ice forms a stable substrate which permits terrestrial taphonomic processes to be imprinted on lacustrine deposits. Bird and mammal scavengers attacked coot carcasses in different manners, resulting in distinct disarticulation sequences. Bird scavengers preferentially fed on the head, neck, and breast-wing complex, causing early disarticulation of bones in these areas, late loss of hindlimb joints, and minimal bone damage. In contrast, mammal scavengers concentrated their attention on the hindlimb and tail region, resulting in bone breakage and early disarticulation of these body parts, but late disarticulation of the breast-wing complex. These data demonstrate that scavenger-specific feeding behaviors significantly influence disarticulation patterns early in assemblage formation, while anatomy may exert increasingly greater influence on disarticulation patterns as carasses become less attractive to scavengers. Finally, because taphonomic processes change in intensity and type through time, bone frequency and modification patterns will vary according to the time at which the patterns are arrested by burial. Thus, bone frequency and modification patterns should provide an index to the relative importance of specific biotic agents and of anatomy in fossil disarticulation patterns as well as an estimate of the time between death and burial.																			0094-8373					SPR	1994	20	2					229	244		10.1017/S0094837300012707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0094837300012707													WOS:A1994NU53400009
J	Zhou, L; Xu, ZF; Fan, PK; Zhou, JW				Zhou, Li; Xu, Zhifang; Fan, Peikuan; Zhou, Jianwei			Enrichment of arsenic in the Yarlung Tsangpo basin, Southern Tibetan Plateau: Provenance, process, and link with tectonic setting	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Geogenic As enrichment is prevalent in freshwater systems worldwide, yet the connection between such enrichment and regional tectonics remains poorly understood, especially within orogenic environments like the Tibetan Plateau. To provide new insights into the sources and processes of arsenic, as well as its relationship with tectonics in the plateau basin, we selected the Yarlung Tsangpo basin, situated at the collision zone between the Indian (Himalaya block) and Eurasian plates (Lhasa block) as the study area. We analyzed and compared the chemical compositions of waters and sediments across various litho-tectonic domains. This also involved assessing arsenic concentrations in river waters, suspended particulate matter (SPM), sediments, geothermal waters, and rocks. The main findings are as follows: (a) High-arsenic geothermal waters and igneous rocks are common in the Lhasa block, and the discharge of these geothermal waters is the main source of dissolved As in river water, whereas erosion of igneous rocks contributes most of the As in sediments. (b) Metal oxides adsorb dissolved As, which leads to further As enrichment in the sediments. (c) The occurrence of high As concentrations in the southern Tibetan Plateau can be explained by a crustal cycling model. Arsenic likely originated in NeoTethys oceanic crustal rocks and was concentrated in the upper crust of the active continental margin (Lhasa block) during geological cycling at convergent plate boundaries. These studies highlight the role of tectonic settings on influencing arsenic enrichment in the plateau basin.

For this purpose, the 3-D Boussinesq equations of motion were numerically solved using large-eddy simulation (LES) in a simplified (trapezoidal) stratified basin to compute the flow driven by a periodic wind shear stress working at the free surface along the principal axis. The domain and flow parameters of the LES experiment were chosen based on the conditions observed during summer in Lake Alpnach, Switzerland. We examine the diurnal circulation once the flow becomes quasi-periodic. First, the LES results show good agreement with available observations of internal seiching, boundary layer currents, vertical distribution of kinetic energy dissipation and effective diffusivity. Second, we investigated the wind-driven baroclinic cross-shore exchange. Results reveal that a near-resonant regime, arising from the coupling of the periodic wind-forcing (T=24h) and the V2H1 basin-scale internal seiche (TV2H1 approximate to 24h), leads to an active cross-shore circulation that can fully renew near-bottom waters at diurnal scale. Finally, we estimated the bulk mixing efficiency, , of relevant zones, finding high spatial variability both for the turbulence intensity and the rate of mixing (10-310-1). In particular, significant temporal variability along the slopes of the basin was controlled by the periodic along-slope currents resulting from the V2H1 internal seiche.					; SEPULVEDA STEINER, Oscar/IZE-0774-2023; Sepúlveda Steiner, Oscar/IZE-0774-2023; Horna Munoz, Daniel/H-2194-2019; constantinescu, george/A-8896-2008; Ulloa, Hugo N./HOA-7472-2023; Munoz, Daniel/AAV-1866-2021	Ulloa, Hugo N./0000-0002-1995-6630; SEPULVEDA STEINER, Oscar/0000-0001-7919-0297; Horna Munoz, Daniel/0000-0003-2493-9154; constantinescu, george/0000-0001-7060-8378; 													1567-7419	1573-1510				JUN	2019	19	3					667	698		10.1007/s10652-018-9645-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-018-9645-1													WOS:000469019500005

Every year the Game and Fauna Service (Game Fund) estimates the average number of birds and mammals shot by each hunter. Since 1992, I have studied the breeding biology of the woodpigeon, Columba palumbus, and the turtle dove, Streptopelia turtur. My objective is to establish the most appropriate time for the summer hunting season. About 100 000 to 150 000 captive bred chukar, Alectoris chukar cypriotes, are released every year to reinforce the wild population. Since 1996 I marked 121 birds with radiotransmitters to study dispersal, survival, and breeding success. More than 90% of these birds were killed by predators in the first three months. Studies with radiotransmitters also commenced in 1996 with released captive bred hare, Lepus europaeus cyprius, and in 1997 with captive bred reintroduced black francolins Francolinus francolinus. From the protected bird species we are studying the breeding biology of the great tit, Parus major aphrodite, the barn owl, Tyto alba, and the griffon vulture, Gyps fulvus. For the migratory species the Game fund is monitoring the population numbers of the water birds at Larnaca Salt Lake. With a team of scientists from the University of Sassari we are studying the hemoglobin chain structure and the DNA of the Cyprus mouflon, Ovis gmelini ophion. This is going to help us establish taxonomic and evolutionary relationships with other species of wild sheep. With the cooperation of the Veterinary Service of Cyprus we are studying the mortality and decimating factors of the Cyprus mouflon. In addition, we examine mouflon and red fox, Vulpes vulpes, for Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. Finally, I monitor the population numbers of the Fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus.																									1998							1187	1194																WOS:000080237300090

Phytoflagellates were found to be adequate food resources for both juvenile development and egg production. Ingestion measurements were performed with Chlamlydomonas reinhardii. The functional response data give evidence for low feeding efficiency, especially for the naupliar stages. A difference between nauplii and older instars was also found in their quantitative food needs. A higher threshold food concentration was observed for naupliar development (0.4 mg C l-1) than for copepodite development (0.2 mg C l-1). rhe calculation of assimilation efficiencies suggests that the high food requirements are due to low specific ingestion rates rather than poor assimilation efficiency. Development time decreased as algal density increased and males developed more quickly than females at all food concentrations. Body size and carbon content increased with increasing food concentration. Continuous egg production was observed above a food concentration of 0.5 mg C l-1. The results have implications for the life cycle of C.vicinus. Summer diapause is interpreted as a strategy to avoid starvation of the juvenile stages. The facultative herbivory of the adults might be an advantage when competing against other more carnivorous cyclopoid copepods.																			0142-7873					FEB	1994	16	2					171	195		10.1093/plankt/16.2.171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/16.2.171													WOS:A1994NA26600006

Few studies on this topic, however, have been carried out in arid regions where the chironomid community is usually controlled by water salinity. Bosten Lake, northwest China, the largest inland freshwater lake (similar to 1,260 km(2)) in the country, provides a unique opportunity to investigate this relationship in an arid region. A total of 42 surface sediment samples from water depths of 0.9-17.0 m, and 12 chironomid taxa, were used in the analysis. The first principal component analysis (PCA) axis explained 59.3 % of the variance in the chironomid assemblage and there was a significant correlation between PCA axis 1 scores and water depth (R-2 = 0.84, P < 0.001). The chironomid assemblages change significantly at 8.0 m water depth. This threshold corresponds to an abrupt change in the basin slope and the spatial distribution of aquatic vascular plants. Redundancy analysis showed that abundances of Chironomus plumosus-type, Microchironomus and Cryptochironomus are positively correlated with water depth, whereas abundances of Tanytarsus, Polypedilum nubifer-type, Cricotopus and Psectrocladius sordidellus-type are negatively correlated with water depth. These ecological relationships are supported by published data. Qualitative chironomid-inferred changes in lake level and diatom-inferred changes in salinity from sediment core BSTC001 were compared. Close agreement in trends for these two variables validates the use of chironomid assemblages to study palaeo-hydrological variability in this westerlies-dominated, arid region of central Asia.					; Liu, jianbao/X-3646-2019; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; Chen, Jianhui/0000-0002-6768-1619; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2014	51	2			SI		313	323		10.1007/s10933-013-9727-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9727-5													WOS:000330734400012

The dispersion of fibrous amphiboles by glacial processes in the area surrounding Libby, Montana, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mining operations began at a world-class vermiculite deposit at Vermiculite Mountain near Libby, Montana, circa 1920 and ended in 1990. Fibrous and asbestiform amphiboles intergrown with vermiculite ore are suspected to be a causative factor in an abnormally high number of cases of respiratory diseases in former mine and mill workers, and in residents of Libby. The question addressed in this report is whether some of the amphibole from Vermiculite Mountain could have been dispersed by Pleistocene glacial processes rather than by human activity after vermiculite mining began. The history of Pinedale glaciation in the Libby area provides a framework for estimating the presence and distribution of asbestiform amphiboles derived from Vermiculite Mountain and found in naturally occurring sediments of Glacial Lake Kootenai that underlie the Libby Valley area. There were two situations where sediments derived from Vermiculite Mountain were deposited into Glacial Lake Kootenai: (1) as lake-bottom sediments derived from meltwater flowing down Rainy Creek when the valley south of Vermiculite Mountain was free of ice but active ice still covered Vermiculite Mountain; and (2) as lake-bottom sediments eroded from the Rainy Creek outwash and re-deposited during a re-advance of the Purcell Trench Glacier lobe near Moyie Springs, Idaho.

The mapping of glaciomarine landforms and units provides, together with updated radiocarbon information, a framework for catchment evolution and sediment delivery to the lake during deglaciation and glacio-isostatically induced relative sea level fall. A staircase of deltas with descending altitudes provide evidence for a spatially diachronous timing of ice retreat from the catchments around Strathcona Lake. Swath bathymetric mapping coupled with acoustic sediment stratigraphy show draped infills with a transition from marine to rhythmically bedded lacustrine sediments produced by hyperpycnal flows. Multiproxy investigations on a set of sediment cores highlight proglacial varves interrupted by rhythmites resulting from the erosion of fluvially incised glaciomarine sediments stored in the catchment. Pluricentimetric proglacial varves formed during the last century in response to periods of intense glacial melt, notably since the 21st century. The sedimentary record suggests the varved sediments from Strathcona Lake can be used to reconstruct the melting history of the Prince of Wales Icefield. This work provides a geomorphological, sedimentological, and geochemical framework that should guide future varve-based reconstructions of glacial and climatic variability in Ellesmere Island.

The background of the painting was analysed in detail, and numerous morphological correspondences with the Montefeltro area in Central Italy were found. The upper valley of the Senatello stream features the Fumaiolo Massif, renowned for its springs that feed the River Tiber. The region is composed of the limestones and sandstones of the San Marino and Monte Fumaiolo Formations, alongside clay formations from the "Valmarecchia Nappe". This lithological variety, the intense fracturing of the limestone rocks, and climatic and tectonic events during the Middle to Upper Pleistocene produced a complex and varied geomorphology. The landscape is marked by large landslides and significant debris deposits, reflecting its recent evolution. The painting, as well as historical documents and Leonardo's drawings from his time in the Romagna region, provide evidence of a large lake beneath Mount Aquilone. The area was affected by a significant change in the morphology of the slopes, probably caused by a landslide that occurred in the period 1500-1700, a period characterised by climatic and tectonic upheavals, which may have led to the disappearance of the lake.

Rapid sulfurisation of highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkenes in sulfidic Holocene sediments from Ellis Fjord, Antarctica	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Samples of particulate organic matter from the water column and anoxic Holocene sediment layers from the Small Meromictic Basin (SMB) in Ellis Fjord (eastern Antarctica) were analyzed to study the early incorporation of reduced inorganic sulfur species into highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkenes. HBIs were not detected in the water column samples taken during austral winter, whereas compounds containing the C-25 HBI skeleton were abundant in all analyzed Holocene sediment layers. The structure of the C-25:2 HBI alkene and its enriched stable carbon isotopic composition suggest that it is produced by a diatom or diatoms, probably belonging to the Navicula genus in the sea ice which covers the area most of the year. Within just 500 years of deposition, all of the HBI alkene was sulfurised. A mixture of products was formed, including components tentatively identified as a C-25 HBI thiane and three S-containing dimers composed of two C-25:1 HBI skeletons linked together by a sulfide bond. Most was, however, converted to polar S-containing compounds. The reaction rate for sulfurisation of the C-25:2 HBI alkene is the highest observed so far in natural systems. Sterols and other lipids known to be prone to sulfurisation were not sulfurised. The reason for this is unclear. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Halbedel, S; Koschorreck, M				Halbedel, S.; Koschorreck, M.			Regulation of CO2 emissions from temperate streams and reservoirs	BIOGEOSCIENCES												It has become more and more evident that CO2 emission (F-CO2) from freshwater systems is an important part of the global carbon cycle. To date, only a few studies have addressed the different mechanisms that regulate F-CO2 in lotic and lentic systems. In a comparative study we investigated how different biogeochemical and physical factors can affect F-CO2 values in streams and reservoirs. We examined the seasonal variability in CO2 concentrations and emissions from four streams and two pre-dams of a large drinking water reservoir located in the same catchment, and compared them with environmental factors that were measured concurrently. All the streams were generally supersaturated with CO2 throughout the year, while both reservoirs functioned to a small degree as CO2 sinks during summer stratification and CO2 sources after circulation had set in. F-CO2 from streams ranged from 23 to 355 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and exceeded the fluxes recorded for the reservoirs (-8.9 to 161.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Both the generally high piston velocity (k) and the CO2 oversaturation contributed to the higher F-CO2 from streams in comparison to lakes. In both streams and reservoirs F-CO2 was mainly governed by the CO2 concentration (r = 0.92, p < 0.001 for dams; r = 0.90, p < 0.001 for streams), which was in turn affected by metabolic processes and nutrients in both systems and also by lateral inflow in the streams. Besides CO2 concentration, physical factors also influence F-CO2 in lakes and streams. During stratification, F-CO2 in both pre-dams was regulated by primary production in the epilimnion, which led to a decrease of F-CO2. During circulation, when CO2 from the hypolimnion was mixed with the epilimnion, F-CO2 increased on account of the CO2 input from the hypolimnion. The CO2 from the hypolimnion originates from the mineralisation of organic matter. F-CO2 from streams was mainly influenced by geomorphological and hydrological factors affecting k, which is less relevant in low-wind lakes. Under high-wind conditions, however, k regulates F-CO2 from lotic systems as well. We developed a theoretical framework describing the role of the different regulation mechanisms for F-CO2 from streams and lakes. In summary, the dominant factor affecting F-CO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the surface water. Lake stratification has a very important regulatory effect on F-CO2 from lakes on account of its influence on CO2 concentrations and metabolic processes. Nevertheless, F-CO2 values in heterotrophic streams are generally higher. The higher k values are responsible for the comparatively high degree of F-CO2. On a Central European scale, CO2 emission from streams is probably of greater importance than the CO2 flux from standing waters.

New Records of the Ponto-Caspian Predatory Cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) (Crustacea, Onychopoda) in the Water Reservoirs of the Kama and Volga Rivers	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												New habitats of the Ponto-Caspian cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi in the Tetyushi, Ulyanovsk, Volga-Kama, and Kama reaches of the Kuibyshev Reservoir; the upper part of the Votkinsk Reservoir; and the lower part of the Kama Reservoir (near the city of Perm) are revealed by comprehensive studies performed at the water reservoirs of the Volga and Kama Rivers in summer 2015 and 2016. The northernmost find of the invader species was recorded in the Kama River near the town of Dobryanka (58 degrees 26 ' N); thus, the species was found >= 3 degrees further to the north in the Kama River than in the Volga River (54 degrees 57 ' N). The species inhabited the uppermost 5-m water layer and the typical C. (C.) pengoi form represented the species in all the water bodies. In August, Juveniles and parthenogenetic females (body length 1.2-2.0 mm) with 2-7 embryos were observed in the water bodies, and single finds of males were made. The population size of the invader species (<= 100 ind/m(3)) was comparable to that of the taxonomically similar hybrid form of the genus Bythotrephes (B. brevimanus x B. cederstromii) that inhabits the same areas as C. pengoi does. The routes of dispersal and the distinctive features of the spatial distribution and ecology of the species are discussed.

Vegetation, fire, and climate history of the northwestern Great Basin during the last 14,000 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The northwestern Great Basin lies in the transition zone between the mesic Pacific Northwest and xeric intermountain West. The paleoenvironruental history based on pollen, macroscopic charcoal, and plant macrofossils from three sites in the northwestern Great Basin was examined to understand the relationships among the modern vegetation, fire disturbance and climate. The vegetation history suggests that steppe and open forest communities were present at high elevations from ca 11,000 to 7000 cal yr BP, and were replaced by forests composed of white fir, western white pine, and whitebark pine in the late Holocene. Over the last 11,000 years, fires were more frequent in tuid-elevation forests (10-25 fire episodes/1000 years) and rare in high-elevation forests (2-5 fire episodes/1000 years). Applying modern pollen-climate relationships to the fossil pollen spectra provided a means to interpret past climate changes in this region. In the past 9000 years summer temperatures decreased from 1 to 4 C, and annual precipitation has increased 7-15%. These results indicate that the millennial-scale climate forcing driving vegetation changes can be quantified within the intermountain West in general and northwestern Great Basin in particular. In addition, fire call be considered an important component of these ecosystems, but it does not appear to be a forcing mechanism for vegetation change at the resolution of these records.

J	Espa, P; Petaccia, G; Servanzi, L; Sibilla, S				Espa, Paolo; Petaccia, Gabriella; Servanzi, Livia; Sibilla, Stefano			Juvenile fish stranding induced by upstream gate operation: A risk assessment through eco-hydraulic modeling	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Rapidly changing flows in regulated rivers can significantly impair freshwater biotas. At present, this issue is mostly addressed by hydropeaking research. In contrast, only limited information is available concerning the environmental effects of sharp streamflow variations determined by manmade manipulation other than hydroelectricity generation. In this paper, we assessed the stranding risk of juvenile marble trout (Salmo marmoratus), an endemic species of particular interest in the study area, during rapid streamflow decrease controlled by upstream gate operation. Our investigation focused on the falling limb of a regulated flood hydrograph in a residual-flow reach of the Ticino River, located few kilometers below its outlet from Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy). The stranding risk assessment was carried out by coupling two-dimensional unsteady flow simulation and standard habitat suitability modeling. Specifically, we adopted univariate habitat suitability curves, and a threshold for the critical rate of decrease of the water surface elevation (downramping rate), commonly used in hydropeaking assessments. Our results evidenced potential stranding occurrence of the target fish species, and possible mitigation by reducing the rate of streamflow decrease before restoring the minimum flow after flood spilling. However, more reliable estimates, including partitioning the stranding risk into classes, are challenged in our opinion by difficulties arising from extensive field validation and related selection of model parameters. In a global context characterized by the urgent need of mitigating the hydro-morphological alteration of regulated rivers, we are confident that the presented approach could support an improved streamflow management in river reaches below reservoirs and regulated lakes, therefore arousing attention and research advancement by the scientific community.

Although long studied for its sedimentology, diagenesis, and paleomagnetism, the basin's lacustrine and paleoclimate history has not been well understood, and conflicting interpretations exist concerning the relations of Tecopa basin to the Amargosa River and to pluvial Lake Manly in Death Valley. Previous studies also did not recognize basinwide tectonic effects on lake-level history. In this study, we focused on: (1) establishing a chronology of shoreline deposits, as the primary indicator of lake-level history, utilizing well-known ash beds and new uranium-series and luminescence dating; (2) using ostracodes as indicators of water chemistry and water source(s); and (3) correlating lake transgressions to well-preserved fluvial-deltaic sequences. During the early Pleistocene, the Tecopa basin hosted small shallow lakes primarily fed by low-alkalinity water sourced mainly from runoff and (or) a groundwater source chemically unlike the modern springs. The first lake that filled the basin occurred just prior and up to the eruption of the 765 ka Bishop ash during marine isotope stage (MIS) 19; this lake heralded the arrival of the Amargosa River, delivering high-alkalinity water. Two subsequent lake cycles, coeval with MIS 16 (leading up to eruption of 631 ka Lava Creek B ash) and MIS 14 and (or) MIS 12, are marked by prominent accumulations of nearshore and beach deposits. The timing of the youngest of these three lakes, the High lake, is constrained by a uranium-series age of ca. 580 +/- 120 ka on tufa-cemented beach gravel and by estimates from sedimentation rates. Highstand deposits of the Lava Creek and High lakes at the north end of the basin are stratigraphically tied to distinct sequences of fluvial-deltaic deposits fed by alkaline waters of the Amargosa River. The High lake reached the highest level achieved in the Tecopa basin, and it may have briefly discharged southward but did not significantly erode its threshold. The High lake was followed by a long hiatus of as much as 300 k.y., during which there is evidence for alluvial, eolian, and groundwater-discharge deposition, but no lakes. We attribute this hiatus, as have others, to blockage of the Amargosa River by an alluvial fan upstream near Eagle Mountain. A final lake, the Terminal lake, formed when the river once again flowed south into Tecopa basin, but it was likely short-lived due to rapid incision of the former threshold south of Tecopa. Deposits of the Terminal lake are inset below, and are locally unconformable on, deposits of the High lake and the nonlacustrine deposits of the hiatus. The Terminal lake reached its highstand at ca. 185 +/- 21 ka, as dated by infrared-stimulated luminescence on feldspar in beach sand, a time coincident with perennial lake mud and alkaline-tolerant ostracodes in the Badwater core of Lake Manly during MIS 6. A period of stillstand occurred as the Terminal lake drained when the incising river encountered resistant Stirling Quartzite near the head of present-day Amargosa Canyon. Our studies significantly revise the lacustrine and drainage history of the Tecopa basin, show that the MIS 6 high-stand was not the largest lake in the basin as previously published (with implications for potential nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain, Nevada), and provide evidence from shoreline elevations for similar to 20 m of tectonic uplift in the northern part of the basin across an ENE-trending monoclinal flexure.

It provides crucial staging and wintering habitats for a large variety of endangered waterbirds. However, this unique wetland has suffered from serious habitat fragmentation and ecological function degradation caused by increased socioeconomic activities within and surrounding the Nature Reserve. With the aim of enhancing, the Reserve's ecological function while balancing conservation priorities and indispensable socioeconomic activities, the ecological risks resulting from each three scenario were evaluated. To conduct this research, we developed a systematic framework for ecological risk assessment, in which indices of biodiversity, ecological vulnerability and ecological risk were introduced and employed. Then, an ecological risk assessment was conducted for the scenarios and the pros and cons of each scenario were evaluated based on the applicability of a particular risk in each situation. The results of modeling and assessments provided the basis for adopting wetland restoration scenarios allowing for the development of practical suggestions for wetland restoration and habitat modification.

Modeling Daily Ice Cover in Northern Hemisphere Lakes With a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Quantifying lake ice loss is crucial for understanding the impact of climate change on lake ecosystems. In this study, we trained a deep learning model (Long-Short Term Memory with Landsat observations, 1984-2012) to simulate Northern Hemisphere lake ice changes at a fine spatial scale >0.1km2 $\left( > \mathrm{0.1}\mathrm{k}{\mathrm{m}}<^>{\mathrm{2}}\right)$ from 1980 to 2022. The model achieved good performance overall during the test period (2013-2022), and the derived ice-on and ice-off matched well with two independent ice phenology data sets. Results reveal a 76.8% increase in intermittently ice-covered lakes from the 1980s to the 2010s, alongside a 10.7-day shorter ice duration and a 3.9 percentage-points reduction in annual mean ice cover fractions. The model can track daily partial ice cover changes, providing a novel contribution to understanding shifts in lake ice cover with climate change. These findings can provide valuable insights for future limnology studies, such as improving estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from lakes.

In total, 25 meso-eutrophic lakes with piscivorous fish were sampled during summer along a latitudinal gradient in South America. The fish catch per unit of effort and the omnivorous fish to zooplankton biomass ratios were significantly lower in the tropical lakes. Despite the lower fish biomass, no significant difference was found in zooplankton or phytoplankton communities or in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio between the two sets of lakes. Nevertheless, regression models based on the combined dataset show higher cyanobacteria and total phytoplankton biomass at lower zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio and higher omnivorous fish to zooplankton biomass ratio. Cyanobacteria biomass was dominated by non bloom-forming taxa and was inversely related to the biomass of calanoid copepods suggesting that these herbivores may play an important role in controlling edible cyanobacteria in warm shallow lakes. Overall, our results, however, suggest that warming will have relatively minor impacts on the pelagic trophic structure of shallow subtropical lakes supporting the idea of weaker trophic cascades in warm (sub)tropical lakes in comparison to temperate ones.

Water quality monitoring of Shkumbini river (181 km long) was carried out based on the investigation of two different parameters: biological parameters based on some insect and insecticide colonies, used as bioindicators and chemical-physical parameters of the water of the river. Two different stations positioned along the river segment paper-peqin, was selected as the object of present study. EPT-Biotic index and biotic index of family/sequence level, as well as biotic index parameter [Stroud water research center] was used for water quality bioclassification more than 17 families [Ephemerelidae, Baetidae, Hydropsychidae, Cerapotogonidae, Gomphidae, Corduliidae, Cordulegasteridae, etc.] dominated by species of Trichoptera, order Ephemeroptera and followed by Odonata order families are reported in this paper. Water quality parameters i.e., pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved matter, dissolved. oxygen, total suspended-solids and nutrients were monitored in two different stations along the same segment of the river. The water quality assessment is based on: NIVA classification and the European Community directive on "quality of fresh waters supporting fish life". The conclusions from the chemical analyses are in good accordance to those obtained from biological parameters.					; halimi, eltjon/KDO-7827-2024; Lazo, Pranvera/I-5299-2019; Hamzaraj, Etleva/HGA-7741-2022	Lazo, Pranvera/0000-0002-7202-4058; Halimi, Eltjon/0000-0002-8543-0514; 													0970-7077	0975-427X				AUG	2010	22	8					6164	6172																WOS:000279844900049

The Sierra de Cartagena-La Union (SE Spain)	GEOLOGICA ACTA												A comprehensive study at Sierra de Cartagena-La Union (SE Spain) abandoned mine site was carried out to characterise the regime and water quality of the groundwater system after the mine closure. The system consists of five geologic fractured blocks belonging to the Alpujarride and Nevado-Filabride complexes. The aquifer units are composed of limestone and dolostone materials. Recharge is mainly controlled by the N-130 fault system, man-made induced fractures, open-pits and underground workings. Discharge is indicated from open pit lakes by the proximal dome-shaped groundwater level contours. Aquifer natural recharge, assessed by fracture density maps and chloride mass balance, provided consistent results. The water hydrochemical facies show a marked sulphate concentration and acidic pH (average pH of 2.53-6.30). A maximum concentration of 4,100 mg/L of Zn and 40,000 mg/L of sulphate was observed in open-pit lakes. Springs present the lowest residence time and are low mineralised with an average pH of 7.6. Geochemical modelling based on the PHREEQCI code indicates water undersaturation with respect to almost all related mineral species and anoxic conditions prevail in the system. Although an adequate understanding of the regional system is provided, a further detailed hydrochemical study is necessary to assess the undergoing geochemical changes.

Paleodrainage on the Chukchi shelf reveals sea level history and meltwater discharge	MARINE GEOLOGY												CHIRP subbottom data collected across the Chukchi shelf, offshore NW Alaska, imaged numerous paleochannels and valleys that appear to have been downcut and incised during sea level falls associated with glacial intervals. In contrast, the two most recent incisions appear to have been formed during the period of sea level rise following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The architecture and infill associated with these two incisions suggests that they were formed by an increase in discharge. These events appear to be unrelated to sea level fluctuations, but rather triggered by climatic variations during the most recent deglaciation (i.e. meltwater discharge). Radiocarbon dates from sediment cores within the southern incised valley suggest that the two episodes of meltwater discharge may correlate with Meltwater Pulse 1-A (similar to 14,000 cal. yr BP) and evidence of iceberg scouring on outer Chukchi shelf (similar to 12,000 to 13,000 cal. yr BP), respectively. Regional transgression across the interfluves on the middle Chukchi shelf appears to postdate the second meltwater discharge and may correlate with Meltwater Pulse 1-B (11,500 cal. yr BP). This evidence suggests that in glacially dominated landscapes, episodes of large discharge to the shelf might be out of phase with the sea level cycle. In addition, the presence of glacial meltwater drainage on the shelf implies a greater volume of continental glaciation during the LGM than previously recognized. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An Old Mongolian Inscription near the Second (Small) Sulfate Lake in Northern Khakassia as Evidence of Cultural Contacts in the Region in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Age	ARCHAEOLOGY ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF EURASIA												We describe a rare Old Mongolian inscription carved on an outcrop of Devonian sandstone near the Second (Small) Sulfate Lake in northern Khakassia. Tentative translation, dating, and cultural attribution are provided. The condition of the inscription and adjacent representations of humans, animals, and tamgas are described. Three groups of signs of which the Old Mongolian inscription consists are identified. Variants of translation to modern Mongolian and Russian are proposed. One group of signs renders the text: "In the Year of the Snake, the second winter month, the 21st day..." Other graphemes, translated from Mongolian, mean: master, elapsed, horseman, give, herd, steppe (talo). Certain words are indistinct and illegible. The lower and upper chronological limits of the inscription are 1204 to early 1720s. Horsemen figures are carved in the same technique. Old Buryat parallels suggest a rather recent date. Pre-Mongolian tamgas are pecked rather than carved. The script belongs to the latest instances of Old Mongolian epigraphy in the region.																			1563-0110	1531-832X					2024	52	4					125	130		10.17746/1563-0110.2024.52.4.125-130	http://dx.doi.org/10.17746/1563-0110.2024.52.4.125-130													WOS:001418018400011

Tracking the source of the disease is often problematic, however, because routine monitoring of recreational waters (for bacterial counts) is not source specific. The intent of the project reported here was to monitor Escherichia coli levels in a small recreational lake in Iowa and to determine their source. The authors monitored water samples for E. coli and used phenotypic methods to analyze multiple samples of lake water, well water, and known fecal sources. Moderate to high levels of E. coli were found in lake water samples from the swimming area throughout the summer. The highest levels of E. coli were found after rainfall events in both lake water samples and samples taken from monitoring wells. Phenotypic analyses indicated that likely sources of E. coli in the lake included both human and wildlife (goose) fecal material. The authors also found that the phenotype used to characterize E. coli isolated from geese frequenting this lake could not be used to characterize E. coli isolated from geese in a neighboring watershed. Identifying the source of fecal material will help authorities implement the proper preventive measures to avoid fecal contamination of the lake in the future.																			0022-0892					JUL-AUG	2005	68	1					25	30											16121484					WOS:000230533700004

Geomorphology and sedimentology of the Caol Lairig valley, Scottish Highlands: evidence for local glacier margin advance and retreat during the Loch Lomond Stadial	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION												A sedimentological investigation of new sections of Loch Lomond Stadial (LLS) age deposits is presented from Caol Lairig valley, located adjacent to Glen Roy, Lochaber, Scottish Highlands. The ice lobes in Caol Lairig and Glen Roy blocked local fluvial drainage systems forming lakes that cut shorelines, the 'Parallel Roads of Glen Roy' (Agassiz, 1840; Jamieson, 1863, 1892). Within Caol Lairig sediment sequences of proximal, distal and deltaic glaciolacustrine sediments and a subglacial till are reported. The till was deposited during ice advance into the valley and the different glaciolacustrine facies formed in the gap between the head of Caol Lairig and the receding ice margin. When the sediments are related to the shoreline and glacial geomorphological evidence, phases of ice advance and ice retreat and the concomitant changes in lake levels are identified. Initially ice retreat in Glen Roy and Caol Lairig was synchronous but after the fall to 325 m the ice in Glen Roy retreated more quickly than in Caol Lairig. Differences in the ice thickness and the lake water depth in Glen Roy and Caol Lairig may have lead to preferential calving of the Glen Roy ice margin hastening ice retreat.

S.			Immunochemical methods for identification of prey in freshwater zooplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Large, predatory, non-indigenous species such as the cladoceran, Bythotrephes longimanus, can have a profound effect on aquatic food webs, but determining the prey consumed by such species is problematic because they shred prey externally and consume only soft body tissues. We assessed the usefulness of an immunochemical approach, in which putative zooplankton prey were homogenized and polyclonal antibodies against total proteins were raised in rabbits and purified against predator proteins. Using either dot-blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-plate formats, assays easily detected prey proteins in single B. longimanus. Issues encountered included some degree of cross-reaction with predator proteins and among prey species for some antisera and questions concerning determination of a correct blank value for assays, however, there are feasible approaches to resolving these issues. Immunochemical assays were readily applied in to a total of 185 individual B. longimanus in the Lake Michigan pelagic ecosystem in summer of 2008 and 2009 and indicated ingestion of cladoceran and copepod species, typically described in the literature, but also dreissenid veliger larvae and the large copepod Limnocalanus macrurus, not usually considered prey for Bythotrephes. Assays results showed some degree of correlation with numerical abundances of zooplankton prey in the water column, suggesting generalist feeding. Protein immunochemical assays offer a quick, sensitive and practical approach to examining planktonic food-web questions that are compatible with, but have certain advantages over, alternatives such as nucleic acid techniques.					; Berges, John/D-9520-2012; Engevold, Paul/V-6574-2017	Berges, John A/0000-0002-3124-4783; Bowen, Kelly/0000-0002-7886-9262; 													1541-5856					JUN	2020	18	6					221	234		10.1002/lom3.10366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10366		JUN 2020											WOS:000537917300001

We examined the effect of fish stocking in naturallyfishless mountain lakes and ponds on the local populations of the European common frog (Rana temporaria). We surveyed 215 mountain lakes and ponds and noted the presence or absence of frogs and signs of frog reproduction (i.e. tadpoles, eggs). We compared these data with fish stocking data from the regional park management (all surveyed lakes and ponds). Our results show a strong negative effect of fish stocking on the presence of R. temporaria, and an even stronger effect on its breeding presence, but we found a small number of lakes and ponds where coexistence occurred. In addition, the preferential stocking of large, deep lakes and ponds left smaller ponds as the only remaining habitats, a number of which are likely to become temporary due to increased summer temperatures. We recommend a series of measures to conciliate fish stocking for recreational fishing whilst conserving R. temporaria populations, which might be extensible to other high mountain environments.

The icons were examined using non-destructive and microanalytical techniques, namely fluorescence photography under UV light, x-radiography and optical microscopy, in addition to micro-Raman and micro-Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. This study allowed the assessment of the current state of preservation of these icons, revealed prior damage and identified in detail the pigments and materials used in the original paintings and overpaintings. Moreover, it confirmed the usefulness of this approach to the detailed evaluation of icons in general and provided significant structural data on representative portable icons of Cretan-style religious painting. The palette for the original paintings of the two icons consists of the natural pigments caput mortuum, yellow ochre, carbon black, azurite, green earth, cinnabar, white lead, red lake and copper resinate; egg yolk was used as the binder. By contrast, the rather elementary overpaintings are of low tonality, consisting predominantly of mixtures of minium and carbon black, and also the synthetic pigments ultramarine blue, "chrome green" (Prussian blue + lead chromate), chrome yellow and lithopone. A blend of linseed oil and egg provided the binder for the pigments used. The same artist is understood from art historians to have overpainted both icons at the beginning of the 20th century.

Franco) plantations to nitrogen fertilization. Soil samples were collected in the summer of 1986 from fertilized (448 or 470 kg N/ha) and nonfertilized plots at previously established N fertilization experiments near Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia, [Canada] and the Wind River Experimental Forest near Carson, Washington, [USA]. Douglas-fir on these sites were reported to still be responding to N fertilization after 12 and 18 years. Less than 2% of the added 15N was recovered as mineral N after a 14-day laboratory incubation of soil samples from the fertilized and nonfertilized plots. This indicates that gross mineralization could be over 50 times greater than net mineralization in these infertile soils if the remaining 98% of the added 15N was all biologically immobilized. Net mineralization was significantly greater (p .ltoreq. 0.10) in soils from the fertilized plots than in those from the nonfertilized plots at the Wind River site. Though the current differences in N availability did not appear to be related to differences in microbial immobilization, such large rates of immobilization warrant closer scrutiny as a factor in long-term response to fertilization.

Paleoenvironmental reconstructions of this region can assist in understanding the general processes contributing to environmental variation in such arid areas. This study examined a dated sedimentary core containing both peat and lacustrine deposits obtained from the shore of the Bosten Lake, NW China. The study aimed to reconstruct paleoenvironmental variations over the last 3,000 years and to explore the possible drivers of peatland development over the last millennium. An examination of grain size and delta C-13 was conducted to investigate lake level variation. The results showed that the lake level of the Bosten Lake declined gradually between 2,905 and 480 cal yr BP and increased thereafter, consistent with other records of the Bosten Lake. At a centennial timescale, the lake level was high under a wet climate during the Dark Age Cold Period (DACP), whereas it decreased significantly during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). The inferred "cold and wet " and "warm and dry " patterns indicated climatic characteristics of a "westerlies-dominated climatic regime ". In addition, the persistent decreasing lake level during the MWP resulted in Phragmites peatland initiation and development along the shores of the Bosten Lake.

Our approach is based on in situ data and a modelling approach. Three consecutive years were studied for a better understanding of inter-annual variations and the impact of exceptional flood in terms of flow of water exchanged with the river, stored volume and retention time. Each year, the flood plain begins to flood in early November, the period of high water falls in June and the descent of the water begins in July. During normal water-years, we have demonstrated that runoff from the local watershed contributes significantly to the mixture of lake water, constituting more than half of the total water intake until May, the period when river begins to overflow. However, during the exceptional flood of the Amazon overbank flow started about 2 months earlier and the residence time of water was divided by a factor of 2, with an average of a month.

With other factors keep steadily, properly choose and improve the precision of these factors, the estimating accuracy of OK can be enhanced. The Kriging Variance (KV) is the most important parameter that is used to indicate the degree of estimating accuracy of OK. It is shown in the result that the KV falls from 0.273 to 0.218 when the scale minishes 50%. Similarly, the KV rises from 0.273 to 0.333 when the length minishes 50%, the KV rises from 0.273 to 0.434 when the nugget increases 100%. Compared to spherical model of OK (KV is 0.273), the KV of linear model with sill is 0.290, the accuracy of estimating is declined. The variety of scale, length, nugget and the choice of theoretical model can distinctly affect the estimating accuracy of OK in the spatial estimation of ecological environment.

J	Dekker, D				Dekker, Dick			The Effect of Water Diversions and Drought in the Drying-up of Beaverhills Lake, a 140 km2 Ramsar Wetland in Central Alberta	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Beaverhills Lake, a shallow wetland of roughly 10 km x 18 km, shrank in size until it completely dried up in 2006. The primary cause was a ten-year cycle of drought beginning in 1995 when annual precipitation fell below the 30-year mean of 450 mm. Superimposed on the drought, inflowing creeks were dammed for the purpose of restoring or creating upstream duck breeding habitat and to flood hay meadows for local farmers. Since 1973, 17 impoundments and weirs have diverted 1.5 million cubic meters of water per annum. The proportional cost to the lake grew as it became smaller and shallower, and the evaporation rate increased. In 1987, under the North American Waterfowl Conservation Plan, Beaverhills Lake was designated as a Wetland for Tomorrow and an International Ramsar site. In 1996, the lake became a Western Hemisphere Regional Shorebird Reserve. None of these accolades, intended to safeguard the wetland from mismanagement, appears to have helped in halting or reversing the lake's decline. Long-range precipitation and temperature records available from Environment Canada do not support the hypothesis that climate change was a factor in the drying-up of Beaverhills Lake.																			0885-8608	2162-4399				JUL	2014	34	3					346	352		10.3375/043.034.0309	http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.034.0309													WOS:000342875900011
C	Acs, E; Buczko, K		Marino, D; Montresor, M		Acs, E; Buczko, K			Daily changes of reed periphyton composition in a shallow Hungarian lake (Lake Velence)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH INTERNATIONAL DIATOM SYMPOSIUM					13th International Diatom Symposium	SEP 01-07, 1994	MARATEA, ITALY	Int Soc Diatom Res				Reed periphyton stucture was investigated in the middle of summer in 1992. Five replicate samples were collected at mid-day over 25 days from living and sterilised reeds. Two weeks before sampling, a 20 cm portion of 150 below water level reed stems were cleaned with a brush. After cleaning they were covered with black nylon and aluminium foil. A day before starting the investigation, some substrata were collected as controls and examined under light microscope after preparation. Just before the experimental period the reed stems were uncovered and 150 pieces each 20 cm long cleaned and sterilised reed stems were placed in a frame. This frame was fixed under the water level to living reeds, at the same sampling point and depth. The number of living and dead cells was counted and chlorophyll-a content of the periphyton was measured. The ratio of dead:live cells was higher in almost all the samples taken from sterilised reed, and was lowest at the beginning of the experiment. The abundance increased continuously over 11 days on both substrata, then there was a slow-increase period ("steady state"). The same tendency was observed in the chlorophyll-a content of cleaned green reeds. Changes in relative abundance of some diatoms was also examined during the investigation.

This paper addresses the underwater light climate, with reference to effects of suspended solids and growth responses of autotrophs with emphasis on phytoplankton. Effects of the most important factors contributing to the absorption and scattering of light in surface waters were described. A comparison between spectral and scalar approaches to underwater light climate modeling was made and examples of linear approximations to light attenuation equations were presented. It was demonstrated that spectral and scalar photosynthesis models may converge to similar values in spectral-flat, high photon flux environments, but that scalar PAR models may overestimate biomass-specific production by 70%. Such differences can lead to serious overestimates of habitat suitability for the growth and survival of submersed macrophytes, particularly in relatively turbid, coastal waters. Relationships between physical and optical properties of suspended sediments were described theoretically, and illustrated with modeling examples and measurements. It was found that the slowly settling particulate fraction contributed substantially to the suspended solids concentration, and greatly to light attenuation within the water column. It was concluded that distinguishing particles by fall velocity and concomitant light attenuation properties in the modeling of underwater light conditions allowed the establishment of useful, although not simply linear, relationships. In eutrophic, shallow lakes, the largest contribution to light attenuation often originates from phytoplankton on a seasonal basis (months-years), but from suspended solids behavior on a shorter time scale (days-weeks), particularly when water bodies are wind-exposed. Temporal and spatial variabilities in wave height, suspended solids concentrations, and light attenuation within the water column, and their importance for autotrophic growth were described, and illustrated with a case study pertaining to Markermeer, The Netherlands. The influence of underwater light conditions on phytoplankton succession was briefly discussed and illustrated with a case study pertaining to Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands. It was concluded that modeling the underwater light climate in a water body on a few sites only can indicate how important various components are for the attenuation of light, but based on the current state of the art, it can not be expected that this will provide accurate predictions of the underwater light climate, and of phytoplankton and submersed macrophyte growth.					; Zimmerman, Richard/GLT-9568-2022	Zimmerman, Richard/0000-0002-9399-4264; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2001	444	1-3					25	42		10.1023/A:1017512614680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017512614680													WOS:000168334400002

Previous investigations of Dart's Lake porewaters have indicated that within deeper waters ( > 2 m depth), sediment porewaters are elevated in alkalinity relative to overlying lake water. Within the near-shore region, porewaters both considerably more and less acidic than the lake water were observed. Both reduction of strong acid anions (SO4(-2), NO3-) and the mobilization of base cations were significant mechanisms of alkalinity production in porewaters exhibiting reducing conditions. In sediments reflecting oxic conditions, porewaters were generally more acidic than the lakewater. Measurement of groundwater seepage into the lake at the near-shore sites indicated that oxic sites exhibited elevated inputs of groundwater when compared to sites where reducing conditions existed. The acidic porewaters associated with high groundwater flows suggests that groundwater inputs to the lake may be a source of acidity (not alkalinity) on a whole-lake basis.

However, the palaeoenvironment of this unique area has been relatively neglected. Here, pollen data are presented alongside U-series dating and C-14 AMS dating techniques from a 15-m sediment core taken from Poza Tierra Blanca in the CCB. These data suggest the CCB contains palaeoenvironmental information spanning at least the late Pleistocene (84.5 ka BP) to the present and has undergone extensive environmental change, possibly controlled by stadial-interstadial cycles. The CCB is currently functioning as a hydrologically closed system, established around 4 ka BP synchronously with regional drying of the Chihuahuan Desert. Pollen data suggest similar closed hydrology conditions from 33 to 23.13 ka BP - before the onset of full glacial conditions at the LGM. Hydrologically open system characteristics with a dominance of wetter, winter monsoon climate punctuate the long-term record. The wetter conditions observed in these units appear to have facilitated the downslope movement of montane taxa and the expansion of wetland taxa. These data illustrate that novel vegetation assemblages are not just products of deglaciation but represent the interaction of the individualistic response of taxa with the unique climate spaces formed by millennial-scale variability during both glacial and interglacial times.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2019	29	3					457	466		10.1177/0959683618816490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618816490													WOS:000461697500007

An alternative concept suggests that the water-bearing potential of groundwater aquifers is equal to that of ice caps and that changes in the dynamic balance of aquifer charge versus discharge, as a function of the temperature-related intensity of the hydrological cycle, may have driven eustasy during warm climates. However, this idea has long been neglected for two reasons: 1) the large storage potential of subsurface aquifers was confused with the much smaller capacity of rivers and lakes and 2) empirical data were missing that document past variations in the hydrological cycle in relation to eustasy. In the present study we present the first empirical evidence for changes in precipitation, continental weathering intensity and evaporation that correlate with astronomically (long obliquity) forced sea-level cycles during the warmest period of the Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Turonian). We compare sequence-stratigraphic data with changes in the terrigenous mineral assemblage in a low-latitude marine sedimentary sequence from the equatorial humid belt at the South-Tethyan margin (Levant carbonate platform, Jordan), thereby avoiding uncertainties from land-ocean correlations. Our data indicate covariance between cycles in weathering and sea level: predominantly chemical weathering under wet climate conditions is reflected by dominance of weathering products (clays) in deposits that represent sea-level fall (aquifer charge > discharge). Conversely, preservation of weathering-sensitive minerals (feldspars, epidote and pyroxenes) in transgressive sediments reflects decreased continental weathering due to dryer climate (aquifer discharge > charge). Based on our results we suggest that aquifer-eustasy represents a viable alternative to glacio-eustasy as a driver of cyclic 3rd-order sea-level fluctuations during the middle Cretaceous greenhouse climate, and it may have been a pervasive process throughout Earth history.

We reconstructed the pattern of Holocene climate change at Lop Nur saline lake in northwestern China, ACA, using multiple climatic proxies (grain size, TOC, sediment color, and magnetic properties). The results demonstrate that the Holocene climatic pattern in the Lop Nur region during the past 8400 years can be divided into two distinct stages, with the boundary dated to similar to 4000 cal. yr B.P. During the first stage (8400-4000 cal. yr B.P.), the climate was relatively dry and stable; and during the second stage the climate was more humid with high-amplitude variations. This finding is corroborated by other paleoclimatic records from the surrounding area and it is also consistent with the latest international strata chronology for the Holocene. The abrupt climatic shift at similar to 4000 cal. yr B.P. and late Holocene climatic instability in ACA are highlighted in this study. The decreasing temperatures in the study region during the middle to late Holocene were modulated by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, which led to decreasing evaporation and thus to the wetting trend of the middle through late Holocene. The abrupt change at similar to 4000 cal. yr B.P. was caused mainly by a more negative trend of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and by an enhanced El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

In this study, the hydroclimatologic response to projected climatic changes in the Ibera wetlands is assessed. Bias corrected temperature and precipitation data from four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) developed for the CLARIS-LPB project were used to drive the calibrated variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model for different time slices. Derived future scenarios consist on changes in temperature, precipitation and water level of the Ibera' Lake for the periods 2021-2040 and 2071-2090 with respect to present. All RCMs are consistent in predicting a warming for the near future (0-2 degrees C) and also to the end of the century (1.5-4.5 degrees C) in the study region, but differ in the sign and percentage of precipitation changes. VIC modelling results suggest that the Ibera ' Lake level could increase in the twenty-first century and that this increment would be higher in the summer months. Nevertheless, the projected 10 cm of water-level increase could be not so relevant as it is of the same order of magnitude than the observed interdecadal variability of the system.

JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Variability of water balance in closed lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) can be a useful indicator of climate change. While most of lakes over the TP have been expanding, especially in the inner TP, the Yamzho Yumco in the Southern TP faced a significant water level decline in 1975-2012. This study focused on attribution of the water level changes to various factors with the help of a physically based and a statistical model for the water balance of the lake, along with observed precipitation and lake surface evaporation data. Results showed that climatic conditions dominated the changes in water level until 1997, and human activity through the construction and operation of a hydropower station started to play a strong role after 1998. The lake level has gone up and down due to changes in precipitation-generated recharge and evaporation over the study period. The water level decline in 1975-1997 was mainly due to low level of the recharge from precipitation and land runoff. However, the drastic decline of water level in 2006-2012 was far from the reach of the climatic conditions. It was indeed caused by the intensified influence of the building and operation of a nearby hydropower station. It was also found that the water level change during the whole period (1975-2012) followed the aridity index for the basin, especially before 1989. This provides an effective way to predict future changes of lake level, if reliable projections for future climate change and human activity are available.					sang, yan-fang/I-8277-2016; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Sang, Yan-Fang/I-8277-2016	Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618; Sang, Yan-Fang/0000-0001-6770-9311													2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 27	2020	125	6							e2019JD031121	10.1029/2019JD031121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031121													WOS:000529111600027

Its spectacular large glacial lakes, staircases of moraine ridges, and extensive outwash plains have inspired generations of scientists to reconstruct the processes, magnitude, and timing of ice build-up and decay at the mountain front. Surprisingly few of these studies noticed many dozens of giant (>= 10(8) m(3)) mass-wasting deposits in the foreland. We report some of the world's largest terrestrial landslides in the eastern piedmont of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS) along the traces of the former Lago Buenos Aires and Lago Puyerreclon glacier lobes and lakes. More than 283 large rotational slides and lateral spreads followed by debris slides, earthflows, rotational and translational rockslides, complex slides and few large rock avalanches detached some 164 +/- 56 km(3) of material from the slopes of volcanic mesetas, lake-bounding moraines, and river gorge walls. Many of these landslide deposits intersect with well-dated moraine ridges or former glacial-lake shorelines, and offer opportunities for relative dating of slope failure. We estimate that >60% of the landslide volume (similar to 96 km(3)) detached after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Giant slope failures crosscutting shorelines of a large Late Glacial to Early Holocene lake ("glacial lake PIS") likely occurred during successive lake-level drop between similar to 11.5 and 8 ka, and some of them are the largest hitherto documented landslides in moraines. We conclude that 1) large portions of terminal moraines can fail catastrophically several thousand years after emplacement; 2) slopes formed by weak bedrock or unconsolidated glacial deposits bordering glacial lakes can release extremely large landslides; and 3) landslides still occur in the piedmont, particularly along postglacial gorges cut in response to falling lake levels.

J	Ferris, JA; Lehman, JT				Ferris, J. A.; Lehman, J. T.			Nutrient budgets and river impoundments: Interannual variation and implications for detecting future changes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Temporal variability at monthly and annual scales was quantified at the inlets and outlets of 3 sequential impoundments for total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved nitrogen, particulate nitrogen, colored dissolved organic matter, specific conductance, and pH over three years. Chlorophyll a (Ch1-a) was measured within the largest of the 3 impoundments; Secchi disk transparency depth was measured over 9 years. The data were analyzed to characterize "ordinary" temporal variability, and statistical models were constructed to evaluate the sampling effort that would be required to detect predicted changes in response to a municipal ordinance banning phosphorus in lawn fertilizers, as well as to possible removal of the dam forming the middle impoundment. Changes of 25% in monthly mean value would require weekly samples during the summer for only 1 or 2 years for TN and TP, but about 8 years for Ch1-a to achieve statistical confidence that conditions had changed. Bioassay experiments in the most upstream and largest of the 3 impoundments indicated that water residence times are in general too short to permit phytoplankton the opportunity to develop populations large enough to alter biogeochemistry substantially in any of the impoundments. Mass balance calculations tended to confirm this conclusion; the reservoirs acted neither as nutrient sources nor sinks over the period of study.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	3					273	281		10.1080/07438140809354067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354067													WOS:000269666500006

Specifically, trends within the lake were examined, along with an assessment of whether correlations existed between chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) characteristics and O-1(2) production rates and quantum yields. Quantum yield values were determined and used to estimate noontime surface O-1(2) steady-state concentrations ([O-1(2)](ss)). Samples were subdivided into three categories based on their absorbance properties (a300): riverine, river-impacted, or open lake sites. Using calculated surface [O-1(2)](ss), photochemical half-lives under continuous summer sunlight were calculated for cimetidine, a pharmaceutical whose reaction with O-1(2) has been established, to be on the order of hours, days, and a week for the riverine, river-impacted, and open lake waters, respectively. Of the CDOM properties investigated, it was found that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and a300 were the best parameters for predicting production rates of [O-1(2)](ss). For example, given the correlations found, one could predict [O-1(2)],, within a factor of 4 using a300 alone. Changes in the quantum efficiency of O-1(2) production upon dilution of river water samples with lake water samples demonstrated that the CDOM found in the open lake is not simply diluted riverine organic matter. The open lake pool was characterized by low absorption coefficient, low fluorescence, and low DOC, but more highly efficient O-1(2) production and predominates the Lake Superior system spatially. This study establishes that parameters that reflect the quantity of CDOM (e.g., a300 and DOC) correlate with O-1(2) production rates, while parameters that characterize the absorbance spectrum (e.g., spectral slope coefficient and E2:E3) correlate with O-1(2) production quantum yields.					; McNeill, Kristopher/A-9834-2009; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016	Cory, Rose/0000-0001-9867-7084; McNeill, Kristopher/0000-0002-2981-2227; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 3	2012	46	13					7222	7229		10.1021/es301105e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es301105e								22703113					WOS:000305876500044

The species was identified as Hydroides dianthus (Verrill, 1873), and this morphological identification was confirmed by comparing a newly sequenced COI gene fragment with H. dianthus sequences available in GenBank Heavy biofouling on the oyster lease resulted in the need to develop mitigation strategies. It was hypothesized that by understanding the spawning behaviour and spatial/temporal patterns of H. dianthus larvae in Eel Lake. biofouling could be mitigated by determining an optimal depth that oyster cages should be maintained at during its active spawning period. To monitor H. dianthus in Eel Lake, species-specific primers associated with the COI gene were developed. Specificity and sensitivity of primers were tested, and the primer set H. dianthus COI4F/R was chosen for monitoring. Water samples were collected from Eel Lake from June to August 2013. and eDNA was extracted. Spatial and temporal monitoring of H. dianthus using eDNA was completed at four sites (three fouled, one non-fouled), and at three depths (0.3 m, 1.5 in, and 3.0 m) in Eel Lake. Water samples tested positive for H. dianthus in most sites and depths on June 20th. indicating a spawning event had occurred. Subsequently, no significant differences between sites and depths were found and H. dianthus was detected throughout the summer in all locations and depths monitored. The mean % of positive PCR results significantly increased from 18.7 to 65.0% from June to August. Results suggest that H. dianthus spawned frequently during a reproductive season ranging from at least June 20 to August 30 in Eel Lake at temperatures similar to 18-22 degrees C. The results of this study indicated that an optimal oyster cage depth for biofouling mitigation could not be determined and highlighted the challenges to aquaculture associated with biofouling of H. dianthus.																			1989-8649					JUN	2022	13	2					326	343		10.3391/mbi.2022.13.2.05	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2022.13.2.05													WOS:000800340100005

Tidal pumping and biogeochemical processes: Dissolution within the tidal capillary fringe of eogenetic coastal carbonates	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Growing evidence suggests microbial respiration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may be a principal driver of subsurface dissolution and cave formation in eogenetic carbonate rock. Analyses of samples of vadose zone gasses, and geochemical and hydrological data collected from shallow, uncased wells on San Salvador Island, Bahamas, suggest tidally varying water tables may help fuel microbial respiration and dissolution through oxygenation. Respiration of soil organic carbon transported to water tables generates dysaerobic to anaerobic groundwater, limiting aerobic microbial processes. Positive correlations of carbon dioxide (CO2), radon-222 (Rn-222) and water table elevation indicate, however, that tidal pumping of water tables pulls atmospheric air that is rich in oxygen, and low in CO(2)and(222)Rn, into contact with the tidal capillary fringe during falling tides. Ratios of CO(2)and O(2)in vadose gas relative to the atmosphere indicate this atmospheric oxygen fuels respiration within newly-exposed, wetted bedrock. Deficits of expected CO(2)relative to O(2)concentrations indicate some respired CO(2)is likely removed by carbonate mineral dissolution. Tidal pumping also appears capable of transferring oxygen to the freshwater lens, where it could also contribute to respiration and dissolution; dissolved oxygen concentrations at the water table are at least 5% saturated and decline to anaerobic conditions 1-2 m below. Our results demonstrate how tidal pumping of air to vadose zones can drive mineral dissolution reactions that are focused near water tables and may contribute to the formation of laterally continuous vuggy horizons and potentially caves.

J	Khatri, N; Tyagi, S; Rawtani, D				Khatri, Nitasha; Tyagi, Sanjiv; Rawtani, Deepak			Rural environment study for water from different sources in cluster of villages in Mehsana district of Gujarat	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water pollution and water scarcity are major environmental issues in rural and urban areas. They lead to decline in the quality of water, especially drinking water. Proper qualitative assessment of water is thus necessary to ensure that the water consumed is potable. This study aims to analyze the physicochemical parameters in different sources of water in rural areas and assess the quality of water through a classification system based on BIS and CPCB standards. The classification method has defined water quality in six categories, viz., A, B, C, D, E, and F depending on the levels of physicochemical parameters in the water samples. The proposed classification system was applied to nine villages in Kadi Taluka, Mehsana district of Gujarat. The water samples were collected from borewells, lakes, Narmada Canal, and sewerage systems and were analyzed as per APHA and IS methods. It was observed that most of the physicochemical parameters of Narmada Canal and borewell water fell under class A, thus making them most suitable for drinking. Further, a health camp conducted at Karannagar village, Mehsana revealed no incidents of any waterborne diseases. However, there were certain incidents of kidney stones and joint pain in few villages due to high levels of TDS. Toxic metal analysis in all the water sources revealed low to undetectable concentration of toxic metals such as lead, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in all the water sources. It is also recommended that the regular treatment of the Narmada Canal water be continued to maintain its excellent quality.

Mercury Bioaccumulation in a Stream Network	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mercury (Hg) contamination is common in stream and river ecosystems, but factors mediating Hg cycling in the flowing waters are much less understood than in the lakes and wetlands. In this study, we examined the spatial patterns of methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in the dominant groups of aquatic insect larvae across a network of streams (drainage area ranging from 0.5 to 150 km(2)) in northern California during summer baseflow conditions. We found that, with the exception of water striders, all invertebrate groups showed significant (p < 0.05) increases in MeHg concentrations with drainage area. The largest stream in our study watershed, the South Fork Eel River, had the highest aqueous MeHg concentration (unfiltered: 0.13-0.17 ng L-1) while most of the upstream tributaries had aqueous MeHg concentrations close to or below the established detection limits (0.02 ng L-1). A filamentous alga abundant in South Fork Eel River (Cladophora glomerata) had an exceptionally high fraction of total-Hg as MeHg (i.e., %MeHg from 50-100%). Since other potential hotspots of in-stream Hg methylation (e.g., surface sediment and deep pools) had %MeHg lower than or similar to surface water (similar to 14%), we hypothesize that Cladophora and possibly other autotrophs may serve as hotspots of in-stream MeHg production in this bedrock-dominated stream. Recent studies in other regions concluded that wetland abundance in the watershed is the predominant factor in governing Hg concentrations of stream biota. However, our results show that in the absence of wetlands, substantial spatial variation of Hg bioaccumulation can arise in stream networks due to the influence of in-stream processes.

J	Rennella, AM; Quirós, R				Rennella, AM; Quirós, R			The effects of hydrology on plankton biomass in shallow lakes of the Pampa Plain	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Climatic and hydrological variability is usually high in the Pampa Plain (Argentina). However it has not studied yet how this variability may affect the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and community structure in aquatic systems of this region. The main purpose of this study was to assess flushing effects on nutrient and plankton dynamics in two interconnected very shallow lakes of the Pampa Plain. In order to study the impact of hydrology on the plankton biomass and community structure, we compared the summer plankton community among three consecutive years with contrasting hydrological characteristics. Water residence time varied an order of magnitude among years and this variability was correlated to strong changes in physicochemical and biological lake characteristics. Depending on the water discharge level, the hydrological regime within the lakes ranged from lentic to more lotic conditions. Nutrient and phytoplankton biomass were positively related to water discharges. During high flushing periods, nutrients import from intensive agriculture lands leads to a dramatic increase in trophic conditions. On the other hand, macrozooplankton biomass was positively related to water residence time and showed a dramatic decrease during high flushing years. Rotifers biomass was not affected by interannual water discharge variability during the study period. Our results support that in case of lakes with high flushing rates, zooplankton development is dependent on water residence time and that hydrology may have stronger effects on macrozooplankton biomass than top-down control by planktivores.

Physical and biological contributions to metalimnetic oxygen maxima in lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Many lakes have positive, heterograde vertical oxygen (O-2) profiles with a metalimnetic maximum usually assumed to be the result of biological O-2 production. However, supersaturated metalimnetic O-2 maxima are formed by biological processes (net photosynthetic production of O-2) and physical processes (warming of gasses trapped below the thermocline). Although the mechanisms contributing to supersaturated metalimnetic O-2 peaks are understood, the contribution of biological vs. physical processes is not well known in lakes. To examine these contributions, we measured O-2 and argon (Ar) saturation anomalies in the metalimnia of 17 lakes. Unlike O-2, Ar is biologically inert and, therefore, can be used to quantify physical processes. There was a positive Ar anomaly at the depth of the O-2 maximum in every lake. On average, only 14% of the O-2 maximum could be attributed solely to biological production of O-2,O- but this percentage varied widely among lakes. Additionally, in a subset of lakes, the relative saturation of O-2 at the metalimnetic maximum was lower than Ar due to net biological consumption, creating a weaker O-2 maximum than would be expected based on the physical processes alone. Some lakes were sampled multiple times during summer and net ecosystem production (NEP) was also calculated. There were many instances of positive NEP in the metalimnion; however, net autotrophy was usually transient instead of persistent. Overall, biological production of O-2 alone is not responsible for metalimnetic O-2 maxima as both physical and biological processes contribute substantially to the formation and persistence of O-2 maxima in lakes.					; Johnson, Robert/G-5193-2016; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020; Cole, Jonathan/G-4566-2011	Wilkinson, Grace/0000-0003-4051-2249; Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; Johnson, Robert/0000-0003-4072-5623; Kleinhans, Maxwell/0009-0003-5569-9373; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2015	60	1					242	251		10.1002/lno.10022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10022													WOS:000349082600020

Environmental influences on walleye fingerling production in southwestern Minnesota shallow lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Shallow lakes and deep wetlands in southwestern Minnesota are being used as rearing ponds for fingerling walleye Sander vitreus; however, information about the biotic and abiotic variables that influence walleye rearing success in these water bodies is limited and inconsistent. Our objective was to identify the characteristics that most influence fall walleye fingerling production in southwestern Minnesota lacustrine wetlands. We used principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data set. A subsequent correlation analysis using the created independent variables (i.e., principal components scores) indicated that walleye fingerling production measures were positively related to total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen and negatively associated with Secchi disk depth and water conductivity (r = 0.70-0.74). Invertebrate densities, particularly that of zooplankton, exhibited weak but positive associations with walleye fingerling production (r = 0.48-0.57). The negative influence of other fishes on fingerling production was evident, as fish community species richness was negatively correlated with walleye fingerling production indices (r = -0.75 to -0.48). Adequate prey resources, elevated productivity indices, and the absence of a fish community were thus important characteristics for selecting potential walleye fingerling rearing ponds. In addition, walleye fry that were taken from the hatchery in excellent condition, displayed heavy pigmentation, demonstrated a high activity level, and exhibited uniform distribution during transport enhanced walleye fingerling production.

J	Ziaja, SFP				Ziaja, Sonya F. P.			RULES AND VALUES IN VIRTUAL OPTIMIZATION OF CALIFORNIA HYDROPOWER	NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL												Optimization models for California's hydropower system are designed to be decision-support tools and aids for climate adaptation decision-making. In practice, they fall short of this goal. One potential explanation is that optimization models are not more successful because they are built on, and depend on, a misrepresentation of law and politics. The legal reality of California's hydropower system is a web of networked jurisdictions of multiple federal and state agencies, with varying levels of coordination, long periods of legally obligated stability with rigid rules, and prone to conflict, but with multiple procedures for conflict resolution. Barriers to climate adaptation from that mix vary according to where a given dam is located. The virtual institutional arrangements represented in optimization models are not a simplification of existing arrangements. Instead, they are a dramatic replacement. That replacement is deliberate and reasoned. As seen in two optimization models supported by the state of California, CALVIN and INFORM, the operation of the optimization function of computer models depends on a virtual system of rules that are centrally controlled, coordinated, nimble, and without the possibility of conflict (let alone conflict resolution). But that smooth virtual system comes with a real cost. Institutional economics suggests that this mismatch between existing formal law and represented law may upend the results of models, since value is determined from institutional context.																			0028-0739					SUM	2017	57	2					329	360																WOS:000405655900002
J	Villar-Argaiz, M; Medina-Sánchez, JM; Carrillo, P				Villar-Argaiz, Manuel; Medina-Sanchez, Juan M.; Carrillo, Presentacion			Microbial carbon production and transfer across trophic levels is affected by solar UVA and phosphorus	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Processes and environmental factors that alter carbon fixation and fluxes are key to understanding ecosystem function and impacts of global change stressors. We tested the effects of ultraviolet A radiation (UVA) and nutrients on the C-14 production of particulate (bacteria, algae and zooplankton size fractions) and dissolved organic carbon. Experiments were carried out in situ on two occasions during the ice-free period of a high mountain lake (Sierra Nevada, Spain). The production of organic carbon was strongly modulated by nutrients and moderately by UVA. While UVA generally reduced primary production, this effect was alleviated by nutrient enrichment. Nutrients had opposite effects to UVA on basal trophic levels by inhibiting primary production and stimulating the bacterial incorporation of algal carbon exudates in the midsummer experiment, and vice versa in the early fall experiment. Also, nutrients had a pronounced effect stimulating particulate carbon in zooplankton only in midsummer when organisms were actively growing. These results suggest that, while UVA effects are restricted to the basal trophic levels of primary producers and bacteria, effects of nutrients transfer up the food web. However, higher carbon accrual in zooplankton during midsummer may not result into higher growth due to inefficient carbon absorption.

Steele; Mamalis, Nick			Prevention of capsular bag opacification with a new hydrophilic acrylic disk-shaped intraocular lens	JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY												PURPOSE: To evaluate capsular bag opacification with a new disk-shaped single-piece hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) suspended between 2 haptic rings connected by a pillar of the haptic material and with a commercially available single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL in rabbits. SETTING: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: The study IOL was implanted in the right eyes of 5 New Zealand rabbits and the control IOL in the left eyes. Slitlamp examination was performed at weeks 1 through 5. After the rabbits were humanely killed, the globes were enucleated and examined by ultrasound. Capsular bag opacification scoring from the posterior aspect (Miyake-Apple view) was then performed, followed by histopathology. RESULTS: Trace honeycomb posterior capsule opacification (PCO) was noted in some study eyes. All control eyes developed moderate to marked PCO, which was more pronounced at the level of the optic-haptic junction. The mean PCO score was 0.4 +/- 0.22 (SD) in the study group and 3.4 +/- 0.54 in the control group (P=.000179, paired ttest). Minimal proliferative cortical material was confined to the space between the anterior and posterior rings of the study IOL haptics. Anterior capsule opacification was absent in study eyes and mild in control eyes. There was no contact between the anterior capsule and the anterior surface of study IOLs. CONCLUSION: The peripheral rings of the study IOL, by expanding the capsular bag and preventing IOL surface contact with the anterior capsule, appear to prevent opacification of the capsular bag.																			0886-3350					DEC	2011	37	12					2194	2200		10.1016/j.jcrs.2011.05.049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2011.05.049								22108114					WOS:000298026000017
J	Rohrlack, T				Rohrlack, Thomas			Hypolimnetic assimilation of ammonium by the nuisance alga Gonyostomum semen	AIMS MICROBIOLOGY												Gonyostomum semen is a bloom-forming freshwater raphidophyte that is currently on the increase, which concerns water managers and ecologists alike. Much indicates that the recent success of G. semen is linked to its diel vertical migration (DVM), which helps to overcome the spatial separation of optimal light conditions for photosynthesis at the surface of a lake and the high concentration of phosphate in the hypolimnion. I here present data from a field study conducted in Lake Lundebyvannet (Norway) in 2017-2019 that are consistent with the idea that the DVM of G. semen also allows for a hypolimnetic uptake of ammonium. As expected, microbial mineralization of organic matter in a low-oxygen environment led to an accumulation of ammonium in the hypolimnion as long as G. semen was absent. In contrast, a decreasing or constantly lower concentration of hypolimnetic ammonium was found in presence of a migrating G. semen population. In summer of 2019, a short break in the DVM of G. semen coincided with a rapid accumulation of hypolimnetic ammonium, which was equally rapidly decimated when G. semen resumed its DVM. Taken together, these data support the idea that G. semen can exploit the hypolimnetic pool of ammonium, which may be one reason for the recent success of the species and its significant impact on the structure of the aquatic food web.																			2471-1888						2020	6	2					92	105		10.3934/microbiol.2020006	http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/microbiol.2020006								32617443					WOS:000546480900001

Evaluating the potential for prezygotic isolation and hybridization between landlocked and anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) following secondary contact	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												The recent increase in river restoration projects is altering habitat connectivity for many aquatic species, increasing the chance that previously isolated populations will come into secondary contact. Anadromous and landlocked alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) are currently undergoing secondary contact as a result of a fishway installation at Rogers Lake in Old Lyme, Connecticut. To determine the degree of prezygotic isolation and potential for hybridization between alewife life history forms, we constructed spawning time distributions for two anadromous and three landlocked alewife populations using otolith-derived age estimates. In addition, we analyzed long-term data from anadromous alewife migratory spawning runs to look for trends in arrival date and spawning time. Our results indicated that anadromous alewife spawned earlier and over a shorter duration than landlocked alewife, but 3%-13% of landlocked alewife spawning overlapped with the anadromous alewife spawning period. The degree of spawning time overlap was primarily driven by annual and population-level variation in the timing of spawning by landlocked alewife, whereas the timing and duration of spawning for anadromous alewife were found to be relatively invariant among years in our study system. For alewife and many other anadromous fish species, the increase in fish passage river restoration projects in the coming decades will re-establish habitat connectivity and may bring isolated populations into contact. Hybridization between life history forms may occur when prezygotic isolating mechanisms are minimal, leading to potentially rapid ecological and evolutionary changes in restored habitats.					; Post, David/A-6987-2009	Scranton, Katherine/0000-0002-7656-676X; Littrell, Katherine/0000-0001-8113-2408; Post, David/0000-0003-1434-7729													1752-4571					OCT	2018	11	9					1554	1566		10.1111/eva.12645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.12645								30344627					WOS:000447131200007

Furthermore, ostracod ecological relationships are complex, with each species occupying a multidimensional niche, and a range of statistical techniques can be employed to establish the significance of different environmental variables on species distribution. We employ logistic regression (LR) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to define ostracod species niches and assemblage response to environmental gradients, using a modem dataset of 465 ostracod samples from the eastern Iberian Peninsula. In addition to these ecological analyses, we develop ostracod-based transfer functions for the quantitative reconstruction of past environmental change from a modem regional data-set of non-marine ostracod and limnological data, by means of weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration. Examples cited are primarily from modem and fossil ostracod samples from Iberian water bodies. Our results suggest that water chemistry (solute composition and concentration) and temperature are the factors to which non-marine ostracod species respond in a more clear and consistent way. Species-environment relationships modelled using the transfer-function approach of WA are strong for the above-mentioned variables, and therefore these models may be of great help in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

Anticipating climate change impacts on Mongolian salmonids: bioenergetics models for lenok and Baikal grayling	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The Eg-Uur River ecosystem in north-central Mongolia provides an opportunity to study salmonid species in a system that has already experienced significant climate change. These species are currently imperilled in Mongolian waters, with Baikal grayling (Thymallus arcticus baicalensis) listed as near-threatened and lenok (Brachymystax lenok) listed as vulnerable on the Mongolian red list. Air temperature records demonstrate that in the last 40years Northern Mongolia's rate of warming has been three times greater than the northern hemisphere average. Despite alarming trends in air temperatures, little is known of the thermal ecology of these species. Due to the threat of climate change to these species, the objective of our study was to quantify metabolic costs for these species from streamside routine metabolic measures and derive bioenergetics models that we used to assess potential climate change response. Streamside measurements of metabolism were remarkably consistent with expectations from measures of other salmonids gathered under more closely controlled laboratory conditions. Metabolism increased exponentially with temperature for both species. The resulting preliminary bioenergetics models suggest these species are already experiencing temperatures near their upper levels for growth during summer and conditions are expected to deteriorate with warming. Even a modest 2 degrees C increase in water temperatures during ice out would result in a 59% reduction in growth of lenok, and an inability of Baikal grayling to grow (if food levels remained unchanged) or a 14-23% increase in consumption in order to maintain current growth rates.

We here present detailed sedimentologic investigations of the Oligocene to early Miocene succession in the Sikouzi section, northern China, to determine monsoon evolution during this time. The particle-size characteristics and grain surface structures, in combination with the large-scale cross-bedding arrangements, graded bedding laminations, and small-scale deformation structures, type the Oligocene red beds in association I as eolian, attributable to large dune forms. Rare earth element results imply that the Oligocene sediments are possibly sourced from a local provenance in the West Qinling Mountains, excluding a more regional wind system during this time. Packages of thick-bedded dark-red mudstone/silty mudstone as well as subordinate medium-bedded pale-gray fine-to medium-grained sandstone and thin-bedded gypsum, with the massive mudstone/silty mudstone taking dominance, point to a lacustrine deposition with deeper-lake phases taking dominance for the early Miocene association II. This significant transition in depositional environments, while possibly linked to local tectonic and/or global eustatic events, ismore likely to reflect a shift of regional paleoclimates from arid to more humid regimes. We attribute the shift to the impact of an active East Asian summer monsoon. Our results, combined with those for previously well-defined loess in the early Miocene, demonstrate activity (onset or possibly intensification) of an East Asian monsoon system around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary.

Suggestions from a Case Study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Feedback between submerged macrophytes and water transparency stabilizing the clear, macrophyte-dominated regime has been described so far for shallow lakes. Based on data of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, underwater light supply, phytoplankton and submerged macrophyte abundance from narrow, stratified Lake Scharmutzelsee (mean depth: 9 m, retention time: 16 yr) of the period 1994-2006 we hypothesize that submerged macrophytes may influence transparency and trophic state in deep lakes. The take was characterized by summer epilimnion TP concentrations of 38 to 57 jig L, turbid water due to mass development of cyanobacteria, and low abundance Of few Submerged macrophyte species until 2003. Thereafter, a Sudden increase in water transparency was followed by a rapid submerged macrophyte colonization of the littoral down to about 5 in depth corresponding to the depth of a light supply of 3 E m(-2) d(-1). Initially, this recolonization was probably a consequence of decreased turbidity. We argue that the increase Of Submerged macrophyte coverage from < 10% in 1994 to 2003 to about 24% in 2005-2006 has contributed to the stabilization of the clear-water regime during the subsequent years. This is supported by the fact that earlier shifts to clear-water regimes in 1994 and 2000 without a significant spread of submerged macrophytes were not stable. We discuss potential mechanisms that may have resulted in a positive effect of plants on transparency such as p uptake and immobilization by the dominant rootless macrophyte species Nitellopsis obtusa and Ceratophyllum demersum and other macrophyte-related mechanisms such as increased zooplankton grazing and allelopathy.					; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023; Rücker, Jacqueline/H-8994-2019	Rucker, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6841-7724; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2010	39	2					725	733		10.2134/jeq2009.0122	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.0122								20176845					WOS:000275383600029

Lake Tyrrell is a 150-km2 inland salt playa. Acid-saline groundwater enters the playa through springs along the lake margin and is evapo-concentrated past halite precipitation. The brines were found to contain sea salts, but some solutes do not follow the seawater evaporation curve. Processes that occur in neutral-alkaline systems (e.g., gypsum formation) occur here, but precipitation of alunite (KAl3 (SO4)2(OH)6), jarosite (KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6) and Fe-oxides also affect solute behavior. Processes that occur in the recharge area and along the groundwater flow path (K uptake, calcrete and gypcrete formation) affect the brine's chemical signature. Regardless of the chemical variability found among the samples, solutes have evolved from a common source (sea salt). Acidification, which appears to occur early in the evolution of the groundwater, is related to pyrite oxidation and may be enhanced by precipitation of Fe-oxides, alunite and jarosite, and evaporation. Acidity is maintained in the system because of the lack of buffering capacity of aquifer minerals. We suggest that this acid brine from Australia is another end-member in the Eugster-Jones-Hardie model for the evolution of water by evaporation in closed basins.																			0009-2541					MAR 5	1992	96	1-2					33	52		10.1016/0009-2541(92)90120-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(92)90120-T													WOS:A1992HN07100004

Decision Analysis for the Reintroduction of Bull Trout into the Lower Pend Oreille River, Washington	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The decision to reintroduce a species can be difficult owing to conflicting opinions and objectives as well as uncertainty over the outcome. Structured decision making addresses these considerations by identifying realistic fundamental objectives and building achievable management alternatives within a quantitative modeling framework. The process is driven by participation of stakeholders that represent diverse objectives, policy mandates, and opinions regarding decision alternatives. We applied structured decision making to evaluate the reintroduction of Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus into the lower Pend Oreille River in northeastern Washington State. We engaged stakeholders from tribal, municipal, county, state, and federal agencies to specify fundamental objectives, formulate feasible reintroduction decisions, and conceptualize a modeling framework that included biological information and stakeholder assumptions. Stakeholders requested iterative decision sets to determine the optimal recipient streams and release strategies. The optimal decision-based on the fundamental objective of maximizing adult abundance at year 10-was artificial propagation of 4,500 juvenile Bull Trout coupled with translocation of 25 adult migrants to be reintroduced into a tributary and lake system (Sullivan Lake/Harvey Creek) that produced at least 18% more adult fish relative to alternatives. Sensitivity analyses were robust to the identity of the recipient stream (i.e., Sullivan Lake/Harvey Creek was always the optimal recipient stream) but suggested that maximizing the number of artificially produced juveniles released could generate a similar number of adult Bull Trout as the coupled-release strategy. Results also suggested that ensuring fish passage at Albeni Falls Dam on the main-stem Pend Oreille River could increase the abundance of adult fish. The process followed for this case study can be adapted to similar decisions regarding reintroduction or other translocations of fish in other systems.

The historical analysis responds to the restricted and threatened situation of the species and provides important information to promote conservation. Length-weight relationship indicates an isometric growth mainly related to the individuals from the Zacapu Lake. The condition coefficient of fish was greater in Zacapu (3.41) than in Cuitzeo (3.29), aspect that could be related to better development conditions in Zacapu (food and habitat). 25.9 mm standard length was determined as the average size for the first reproduction in females. This species had multiple reproductive cycles and fry born continuously from April to November. Sexual proportion presented dominance from females on males. The stomach content analysis revealed that H. turneri is an epibentophagic to bentophagic carnivorous. Diet presented no significant difference when comparing populations from both lakes (MRPP analysis, A = -0.02, p = 0.71). The trophic level classified the species as primary consumer, related to the high detritus consumption. Finally, restoration measures must be implemented in Cuitzeo Lake, principally the wastewater diversion and treatment. In Zacapu Lake, conservation measures must be related to the restriction of spring water extraction to maintain the hydrodynamic ecosystem processes.

The interval 11500-8500 cal BP has been divided into five phases with respect to the inferred strength of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and Irminger Currents (IC). Phase 1 (11 500-10 750 cal BP) was characterised by the first establishment of the NAC and IC in the vicinity of the studied sites, interrupted by the Preboreal Oscillation around 11 200cal BP. Phase 2 (10 750-10 100 cal BP) was marked by a further warming step in southern Greenland rather concordant with a change into colder and more variable winters on the Faroe Islands. It is proposed that this could partly be related to a series of melt water outbursts disturbing the thermohaline circulation in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, resulting in a warming trend in the western region. During Phase 3 (10 100-9400cal BP) the strength of the IC reaching northwestern Iceland intensified. A more stable regime in surface circulation was established at the onset of Phase 4 (9400-8900 cal BP) in southern Greenland and was followed by a change towards further warm conditions on Iceland at the onset of Phase 5 (8900-8500 cal BP).

J	Nakayama, T; Shankman, D				Nakayama, Tadanobu; Shankman, David			Impact of the Three-Gorges Dam and water transfer project on Changjiang floods	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Increasing frequency of severe floods on the middle and lower Changjiang (Yangtze) River during the past few decades can be attributed to both abnormal monsoon rainfall and landscape changes that include extensive deforestation affecting river sedimentation, and shrinking lakes and levee construction that reduced the areas available for floodwater storage. The Three-Gorges Dam (TGD) and the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) will also affect frequency and intensity of severe floods in the Poyang Lake region of the middle Changjiang. Process-based National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model predicts that the TGD will increase flood risk during the early summer monsoon against the original justifications for building the dam, relating to complex river-lake-groundwater interactions. Several scenarios predict that morphological change will increase flood risk around the lake. This indicates the importance of managing both flood discharge and sediment deposition for the entire basin. Further, the authors assessed the impact of sand mining in the lake after its prohibition on the Changjiang, and clarified that alternative scenario of sand mining in lakes currently disconnected from the mainstream would reduce the flood risk to a greater extent than intensive dredging along junction channel. Because dry biomasses simulated by the model were linearly related to the Time-Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (TINDVI) estimated from satellite images, its decadal gradient during 1982-1999 showed a spatially heterogeneous distribution and generally decreasing trends beside the lakes, indicating that the increases in lake reclamation and the resultant decrease in rice productivity are closely related to the hydrologic changes. This integrated approach could help to minimize flood damage and promote better decisions addressing sustainable development (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changes in the Sultan Marshes ecosystem (Turkey) in satellite images 1980-2003	WETLANDS												Sultan Marshes, an important ecosystem and wildlife refuge in the Develi Basin in Turkey, originally included two lakes and two freshwater marshes, with a total surface area of 176 km(2), surrounded by wet meadows and salt steppes. The Develi Irrigation Project changed the Sultan Marshes severely starting in 1988 by diverting surface and ground-water flows from the wetlands. Water diversions caused more than 1 m decline in water levels in the lakes and marshes. Spatial changes in the Sultan Marshes ecosystem With time were analyzed using Landsat images from 1980, 1987 2000, and 2003 that were transformed into five information classes (water, marsh, agriculture, dry lake, and steppe) by unsupervised classification. Changes were identified by a post-classification change detection method. Classification accuracies were 89% to 93%, and accuracies of the change maps were 80% to 85%. The analysis showed that lake surface areas decreased by 93% from 1980 to 2003. Yay Lake was almost completely dry in 2003. The marshes receded more than 50%. and the surrounding steppe expanded into the lakes and marshes. Agriculture expanded in the western and eastern parts (Kepir Marshes) of he study area. Although the years 2000 and 2003 had lower than average annual precipitation, and lower annual precipitation than in 1980 and 1987. the changes in Sultan Marshes are so large that they cannot be solely attributed to weather fluctuations. Surface water diversions and increased Use of spring waters and ground water are responsible for the changes.					; Brezonik, Patrick/ISV-2988-2023; Dadaser-Celik, Filiz/AAE-2824-2019	Dadaser-Celik, Filiz/0000-0003-3623-7723; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2008	28	3					852	865		10.1672/07-182.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/07-182.1													WOS:000258711600028

Land-cover, climate and fjord morphology drive differences in organic matter and nutrient dynamics in two contrasting northern river-fjord systems	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Climate and land-use changes are leading to impacts on individual ecosystems as well as shifts in transfer dynamics between interconnected systems. At the land-ocean interface, changes in riverine inputs of organic matter (OM) and nutrients have the potential to lead to shifts in coastal carbon and nutrient cycling with consequences for ecosystem structure and function. In this study, we assess OM and nutrient dynamics for two contrasting Norwegian river-to-fjord systems: a boreal system with a forested catchment draining into a narrow fjord (Marrow boreal system'), and a subarctic system where lowland forests and mountainous regions drain into a broad fjord broad subarctic system'). We characterized seasonal organic carbon and nutrient concentrations and DOM absorption properties for samples collected along transects from river to outer fjord during 2015/2016. While differences in catchment properties drove contrasts in river chemistry between the two study rivers, fjord morphology and hydrodynamics as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient concentrations in marine receiving waters predicted water-chemistry patterns along the transect. The narrow boreal system, with high riverine DOC and nutrient concentrations, was structured mainly by a horizontal salinity gradient from river to outer fjord, with limited impact of seasonality. In contrast, the broad subarctic system tended to be dominated by vertical salinity stratification, with strong between-date differences in surface water salinity linked to seasonality in river discharge. These dynamics were also reflected in the strong horizontal gradients in DOC, nutrients and DOM properties in the narrow boreal system, in contrast to the broad subarctic system, where strong seasonality paired with a lack of strong contrast between riverine and marine concentrations of DOC and most nutrients led to an uncoupling between salinity and other water chemistry variables. In the narrow boreal system, terrestrial OM dominated both the particulate and dissolved OM pools, while OM in the broad subarctic system was derived primarily from marine phytoplankton. Non-linear declines in NO3 + NO2 were observed consistently in the boreal system and during the productive spring season in the subarctic system, suggesting biological uptake and a potentially important role of these rivers as sources of bioavailable N to coastal ecosystems. The results from these two case studies highlight the complex and interacting effects of catchment landcover, river water chemistry and discharge, fjord morphometry and hydrodynamics in structuring the transport, fate and potential impacts of terrestrially-derived nutrients and organic matter in northern coastal environments.

In this lake, bottom water becomes anoxic during summer due to a strong halocline. Lake water has ample dissolved SO4 (2-) and the surface sediments are rich in planktic organic matter (C/N 7-9), which is highly reactive in terms of sulfate reduction. In this setting the amount of TOC should be a critical factor regulating the activity of sulfate reduction and H2S production. In portions of the lake where sediment TOC content is less than 3.5 %, H2S was very low or absent in both bottom and pore waters. However, in areas with TOC > 3.5 %, H2S was correlated with TOC content (pore water H2S (ppm) = 13.9 x TOC (%) - 52.1, correlation coefficient: 0.72). H2S was also present in areas with sediment TS above 1.2 % (present as iron sulfide), which suggests that iron sulfide formation is tied to the amount of TOC. Based on this relationship, H2S production has progressively increased after the initiation of land reclamation projects in Lake Nakaumi, as the area of sapropel sediments has significantly increased. This TOC-H2S relationship at sediment-water interface might be used to infer H2S production in brackish-lagoonal systems similar to Lake Nakaumi, with readily available SO4 (2-) and reactive organic matter.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2013	68	7					1999	2006		10.1007/s12665-012-1887-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-1887-5													WOS:000316121300016
J	Kaposi, Z; Gonda, T				Kaposi, Zoltan; Gonda, Tibor			The beginnings of tourism development on Lake Balaton: the role of the Count Hunyady family in the development of Balaton tourism	JOURNAL OF TOURISM HISTORY												In this study the authors examine how the development of tourism started along the largest natural lake in Central-Europe, Lake Balaton in Hungary at the end of the nineteenth century - in an era when beachgoing became increasingly popular all-around Europe. To achieve this the authors used archival, statistical and press sources alongside the academic literature and museum sources. The authors have shown that the large estate owning upper class played the key role. The first initiative in this regard was launched in 1881, when Count Imre Hunyady, owner of a 31,000-acre manor in K & eacute;thely, built the first holiday villa on his Balatonber & eacute;ny estate in the south-western part of the lake. The Count created a park and subdivisions, built a harbour, initiated the establishment of restaurants and hotels and various services for the holiday-makers. Many followed in his footsteps, and thus within a few years similar beach resorts had sprung up on the southern shore of Lake Balaton. Resort development benefited considerably for the owners: not only were they able to supply thousands of guests from their own large estates, but their developments contributed to the spread of a westernised middle-class way of thinking and lifestyle.																			1755-182X	1755-1838				JAN 2	2025	17	1					71	89		10.1080/1755182X.2024.2448956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1755182X.2024.2448956		JAN 2025											WOS:001406043900001

However, the role of N-influenced P release is less well studied in large-scale ecosystems. To gain more insight into ecosystem effects, we conducted a five-year large-scale experiment in ten ponds (700-1000 m2 each) with two types of sediments and five targeted total N concentrations (TN) by adding NH4Cl fertilizer (0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 25 mg N L-1). The results showed that: (i) The sediment P release increased significantly when TN exceeded 10-25 mg N L-1. (ii) The most pronounced sediment P release increase occurred in summer and from sediments rich in organic matter (OMSed). (iii) TN, algal biomass, fish biomass, non-algal turbidity, sediment pH, and OMSed were the dominant factors explaining the sediment P release, as suggested by piecewise structural equation modeling. We propose several mechanisms that may have stimulated P release, i.e. high ammonium input causes a stoichiometric N:P imbalance and induce alkaline phosphatase production and dissolved P uptake by phytoplankton, leading to enhanced inorganic P diffusion gradient between sediment and water; higher pelagic fish production induced by the higher phytoplankton production may have led increased sediment P resuspension through disturbance; low oxygen level in the upper sediment caused by nitrification and organic decomposition of the settled phytoplankton and, finally, long-term N application-induced sediment acidification as a net effect of ammonium hydrolysis, nitrification, denitrification; The mechanisms revealed by this study shed new light on the complex processes underlying the N-stimulated sediment P release, with implications also for the strategies used for restoring eutrophicated lakes.

Inflow Dynamics in Weakly Stratified Lakes Subject to Large Isopycnal Displacements	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The effect of large-amplitude isopycnal displacements, frequently observed in deep medium-size arctic lakes during the ice-free period, on the near- and far-field fate of negatively buoyant river inflows is explored in this work. A three-dimensional transport and hydrodynamic model of sub-arctic Lake Lagarfljot was used to simulate the fate of river inflows during the summer stratification period. The intrusion dynamics are strongly affected by the amplitude and direction (downwelling/upwelling) of the isopycnal displacements induced by the wind near the river inlet. These displacements control the distance of travel of the river plume until reaching the layers with maximum density gradients (pycnocline) and, thus, the mixing ratio between the river plume and the lake water. Specifically, strong upwelling near the inlet causes the river to flow to the bottom as an underflow. Under downwelling, river plumes tend to form metalimnetic intrusions. The influence of the isopycnal displacements on the initial river fate can be parameterized using a time-varying density Richardson number, which needs to be smoothed to account for the effects of unsteadiness. Large amplitude internal motions, of up to 70 m in Lake Lagarfljot, move deep underflows upwards to shallower basins where they could be readily incorporated into the surface mixed layer and rapidly flushed out of the lake. Metalimnetic currents associated with the V2H1 internal circulation can also accelerate riverine transport out of the lake.

It covers the wavelength range between 0.4 and 0.9 mu m with a spectral resolution of 5.7 nm and a spatial resolution of approximately 90 m. The HICO sensor is not equipped with a second-order blocking filter in front of the focal plane array. As a result, the second-order light from the shorter visible spectral region falls onto the detectors covering the near-IR spectral region above 0.8 mu m. In order to have accurate radiometric calibration of the near-IR channels, the second-order light contribution needs to be removed. The water-leaving radiances of these near-IR channels over clear ocean waters are close to zero because of strong liquid water absorption above 0.8 mu m. Through analysis of HICO imaging data containing features of shallow underwater objects, such as coral reefs, we have developed an empirical technique to correct for the second-order light effects in near-IR channels. HICO data acquired over Midway Island in the Pacific Ocean and the Bahamas Banks in the Atlantic Ocean are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique.					gao, bo/MFI-9383-2025; Li, Rongrong/B-8365-2019														0196-2892					MAR	2012	50	3					824	830		10.1109/TGRS.2011.2163161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2163161													WOS:000300724300013
J	Gorman, OT; Sitar, SP				Gorman, Owen T.; Sitar, Shawn P.			Ups and Downs of Burbot and Their Predator Lake Trout in Lake Superior, 1953-2011	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The fish community of Lake Superior has undergone a spectacular cycle of decline and recovery over the past 60years. A combination of Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus depredation and commercial overfishing resulted in severe declines in Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, which served as the primary top predator of the community. Burbot Lota lota populations also declined as a result of Sea Lamprey depredation, largely owing to the loss of adult fish. After Sea Lamprey control measures were instituted in the early 1960s, Burbot populations rebounded rapidly but Lake Trout populations recovered more slowly and recovery was not fully evident until the mid-1980s. As Lake Trout populations recovered, Burbot populations began to decline, and predation on small Burbot was identified as the most likely cause. By 2000, Burbot densities had dropped below their nadir in the early 1960s and have continued to decline, with the densities of juveniles and small adults falling below that of large adults. Although Burbot populations are at record lows in Lake Superior, the density of large reproductive adults remains stable and a large reserve of adult Burbot is present in deep offshore waters. The combination of the Burbot's early maturation, long life span, and high fecundity provides the species with the resiliency to remain a viable member of the Lake Superior fish community into the foreseeable future.

J	Pautasso, M				Pautasso, M.			FOREST ECOSYSTEMS AND GLOBAL CHANGE: THE CASE STUDY OF INSUBRIA	ANNALI DI BOTANICA												Forest ecosystems face multiple challenges due to climate change, invasive species, urbanization, land use change and the interactions between these global change drivers. this review provides an overview of such challenges for the case study of insubria. insubria is a region on the southern side of the european alps, famous for its stunning lakes (e.g., como, Garda, Lugano, Maggiore), blessed by a relatively mild and humid climate, and shaped by the geologic fault line between the african and european plates. Global change impacts in insubria pose a threat to its biodiversity and chestnut woodlands, particularly through modified winter forest fire regimes. insubric biodiversity conservation, in turn, is essential to counteract the effects of climate change. sustainable management of insubric forests is made more difficult by rural abandonment, air pollution and invasive exotic species. there is a need to develop reliable long-term bio-indicators and to predict the shift of insubric species, ecosystems and tree-lines due to rapid climate changes. insubric studies on forests and global change call for enhanced international collaboration in forest management and research. interdisciplinary approaches are needed to move from studies of single global change drivers to experiments, scenarios and models taking into account their combination and our responses to global change.

J	Bouffard, D; Perga, ME				Bouffard, Damien; Perga, Marie-Elodie			Are flood-driven turbidity currents hot spots for priming effect in lakes?	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In deep stratified lakes, such as Lake Geneva, flood-driven turbidity currents are thought to contribute to the replenishment of deep oxygen by significant transport of river waters saturated with oxygen into the hypolimnion. The overarching aim of this study was to test this long-standing hypothesis directly. It combines direct observational data collected during an extreme flooding event that occurred in May 2015 with dark bioassays designed to evaluate the consequences of river-borne inputs for the hypolimnetic respiration. The exceptional precipitation events of May 2015 caused floods with an annual return time for the Rhone River, the dominant tributary of Lake Geneva, and with 50-year return time for the Dranse River, the second-most important tributary. Sediment-loaded river flows generated turbidity currents plunging into the lake hypolimnion. The observed river intrusions contributed to the redistribution of dissolved oxygen, with no net gain, when occurring in the lowermost hypolimnetic layer. In the uppermost hypolimnion above the last deep-mixing event, the intrusions coincided with a net oxygen deficit. Consistent with field observations, dark bioassays showed that 1 to 50% substitution of riverine organic matter to deep (<200 ) hypolimnetic water did not affect microbial respiration, while the addition of 1 to 10% of riverine water to the uppermost hypolimnetic waters resulted in a respiration over-yielding, i.e. excess respiration of both river-borne and lacustrine organic matter. The results of our study conflict with the hypothesis that flood-driven turbidity currents necessarily increase hypolimnetic oxygen stocks in Lake Geneva. In contrast, results show that flood-driven turbidity currents can be potential hot spots for priming effect in lakes.

It touches on aspects such as inland mobile equipment units, including boats, and the advances that have been made in helicopter deployment of emergency response resources. Featured is a summary of a 1996 training exercise where a rest medium was recovered from under river ice in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The exercise, which was conducted in -35 degrees C (-31 degrees F) conditions, tested improvements made to winter containment and recovery equipment and ice response techniques. The pipeline crosses beneath 440 streams, rivers, and lakes, and approximately 60% of the right-of-way parallels waterways to an extent where a spill could impact them. A release could adversely affect a considerable variety of wildlife and habitats as well as the communities that use these waterways for their water supplies. The company has many spill prevention strategies integrated into its operation and maintenance activities. In addition, an ongoing comprehensive education program and extensive outfitting and upgrading of spill response equipment were deemed necessary to ensure quality stewardship of the resources within its operating area. The paper describes these initiatives, which were instituted in 1989 and continue to this day.																									1997							621	625																WOS:000073241400096

Two well studied members of the family are PPEP-1 and PPEP-2, produced by Clostridioides difficile, a human pathogen, and Paenibacillus alvei, a bee secondary invader, respectively. Both proteases seem to be involved in mediating bacterial adhesion by cleaving cell surface anchor proteins on the bacterium itself. By using basic alignment and phylogenetic profiling analysis, this work shows that the complete family of proteins that contain a PPEP domain includes proteins from more than 130 species spread over 9 genera. These analyses also suggest that the PPEP domain spread through horizontal gene transfer events between species within the Firmicutes' classes Bacilli and Clostridia. Bacterial species containing PPEP homologs are found in diverse habitats, varying from human pathogens and gut microbiota to free-living bacteria, which were isolated from various environments, including extreme conditions such as hot springs, desert soil and salt lakes. The phylogenetic tree reveals the relationships between family members and suggests that smaller subgroups could share cleavage specificity, substrates and functional similarity. Except for PPEP-1 and PPEP-2, no cleavage specificity, specific physiological target, or function has been assigned for any of the other PPEP-family members. Some PPEP proteins have acquired additional domains that recognize and bind noncovalently to various elements of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell-wall, anchoring these PPEPs. Secreted or anchored to the cell-wall surface PPEP proteins seem to perform various functions.					; Corver, Jeroen/LZH-6722-2025	Roelofs, Dick/0000-0003-3954-3590; van Leeuwen, Hans/0000-0003-1694-8421; Corver, Jeroen/0000-0002-9262-5475; Hensbergen, Paul/0000-0002-3193-5445													2666-5174					DEC	2021	2								100024	10.1016/j.crmicr.2021.100024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crmicr.2021.100024								34841315					WOS:001006828200015
J	Genna, D; Gaboury, D; Roy, G				Genna, Dominique; Gaboury, Damien; Roy, Gilles			The Key Tuffite, Matagami Camp, Abitibi Greenstone Belt, Canada: petrogenesis and implications for VMS formation and exploration	MINERALIUM DEPOSITA												The Key Tuffite is a stratigraphic marker unit for most of the zinc-rich volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits of the Matagami Camp in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. This 2- to 6-m-thick unit was previously interpreted as a mixture of ash fall (andesitic to rhyolitic tuffaceous components) and volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS)-related chemical seafloor precipitate (exhalative component). Previous attempts to develop geochemical exploration vectoring tools using metal content within the Key Tuffite were mostly inconclusive due to the complex nature of the Key Tuffite unit and a poor understanding of its composition, origin and relationship with the VMS-forming hydrothermal systems. Detailed mapping and thorough lithogeochemistry of the Key Tuffite in the vicinity of the Perseverance and Bracemac-McLeod deposits indicate that the Key Tuffite is a homogeneous calc-alkaline, andesitic tuff that was deposited before the VMS deposits were formed. The unit is mostly devoid of exhalative component, but it is strongly hydrothermally altered close to orebodies. This is characterized by a strong proximal chloritization and a distal sericitization, which grades laterally into the unaltered Key Tuffite. Neither the Key Tuffite nor the ore was formed by seafloor exhalative processes for the two studied deposits. This probably explains why previously proposed exploration models based on metal scavenging proved unsuccessful and suggests that a re-evaluation of the exhalative model should be done at the scale of the mining camp. However, as shown in this study, hydrothermal alteration can be used to vector towards ore along the Key Tuffite.					; Genna, Dominique/AAA-3852-2021; Gaboury, Damien/AAM-2388-2021	Genna, Dominique/0000-0003-3211-3504; 													0026-4598	1432-1866				APR	2014	49	4					489	512		10.1007/s00126-013-0499-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00126-013-0499-7													WOS:000334271000005

Variability in Natural Conditions of the Periglacial Zone of the Munku- Sardyk Massif (Eastern Sayan)	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Presented are the results from investigating the periglacial zone of the Munku-Sardyk massif in Eastern Sayan. Dendrochronometry data are used in analyzing the cyclicity of natural processes that manifests itself in increment in trees growing in extreme conditions. The analysis revealed secular and intrasecular cycles. A correlation of increments in larch and Siberian stone pine with changes in summer temperatures (the correlation coefficients 0.56 and 0.48, respectively) is observed. For the period of observation of the Peretolchin glacier (1900-2015), the stages of its retreat (1900-1965 and 1983-2000) and advance (19651983) were revealed, which influenced the changes in increment in trees and the degree of accumulation of bottom sediments in the proglacial Lake Ekhoi. A comparison of the character of growth of a "fossil" tree in the Holocene optimum with present-day long-lived trees shows a higher sensitivity of the ancient tree (the coefficient 0.43) and a lower sensitivity in present-day trees (0.32 for larch, and 0.26 for Siberian stone pine). Thermochronometry data were used to determine a decrease in air temperature with height in June (an optimal month for increments in trees) by 0.468 degrees C/100 m.

The sympatric whitefishes Coregonus ussuriensis and C. chadary from the Amur River basin: Morphology, biology and genetic diversity	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY					12th International Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes (ISBMCF)	2014	RUSSIA					Data on morphology, biology and the molecular-genetic variability of the Coregonus ussuriensis (CU) and chadary whitefish C. chadary (Teleostei: Salmoniformes: Coregonidae) (CW) from the upstream and downstream reaches of the Amur River drainage are presented. These species differ in growth rate and morphological traits. Analysis of feeding has shown that CU is euryphagous, although during the summer this species has a significant proportion of fish and insect imago in its diet. Its habits considerably differ from the ecological niche of CW and other pidschian-like whitefishes inhabiting the water bodies of the southern part of Siberia. We have confirmed reliable distinctions between CU and CW in the numbers of gill raker and lateral line scales. The comparative analysis of the morphometric traits showed that a body shape of C. ussuriensis differs both from pidschian-like whitefishes and from C. chadary. The phylogenetic relationships among mtDNA haplotypes were reconstructed based on variability in mitochondrial genes 16 S-ND1 and ND3. The Coregonus species from the Amur River form a monophyletic clade sister to Lake Baikal omul and whitefishes lineage, with two distinct groups corresponding with two studied species. On the basis of our data, we suggest the hypotheses of sympatric and allopatric origins of these species. Two extant Coregonus species could have originated from: (i) a single ancestral whitefish related to Lake Baikal coregonids or (ii) two independent allopatric (Baikalian and south Siberian pidschian-like) forms that migrated to the Amur River basin, presumably asynchronously, with the subsequent hybridization and introgression that could have resulted in the complete replacement of mitochondrial DNA.

J	Zeng, FM; Xiang, SY; Zhang, KX; Lu, YL				Zeng, Fangming; Xiang, Shuyuan; Zhang, Kexin; Lu, Yulin			Environmental evolution recorded by lipid biomarkers from the Tawan loess-paleosol sequences on the west Chinese Loess Plateau during the late Pleistocene	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This study provides a reconstruction of the environmental evolution since 128 ka recorded by the lipid biomarkers of the C-15-C-35 n-alkanes, the C-13-C-33 n-alkan-2-ones and the C-12-C-30 n-alkanols isolated from the Tawan loess section, Northwest China. Variations in paleoenvironment are reconstructed from the values of the carbon preference index (CPI), the average chain length (ACL), the L/H (ratio of lower-molecular-weight to higher-molecular-weight homologues), the n-alkane C-27/C-31 ratios, and the n-alkan-2-one C-27/C-31 ratio. These parameters indicate the dominance of grasses over the west Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) during the late Pleistocene. Lower values of the CPI and the ACL values, respectively, indicate stronger microbial reworking of organic matter and changes in plant species, which are both indicative of a warmer-wetter environment. Furthermore, the fluctuations of environment recorded in the Tawan section exhibit ten phases that show obvious cycles between warm periods and cold intervals. This study reveals that changes in the biomarker proxies agree well with changes in the magnetic susceptibility and grain size, and it indicates a huge potential for paleoenvironmental reconstructions by using the n-alkan-2-one and n-alkanol proxies.

J	Zhang, DL; Chen, X; Li, YM; Zhang, SR				Zhang, Dongliang; Chen, Xi; Li, Yaoming; Zhang, Shengrui			Holocene vegetation dynamics and associated climate changes in the Altai Mountains of the Arid Central Asia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This study reconstructed the vegetation dynamics and associated climate change of the past similar to 4100 years based on the pollen data from a short peat core (i.e., KLSZ-2) in Kelashazi Peat (48.12 degrees N, 88.37 degrees E, 2422 m a.s.l.) in the Altai Mountains. The reconstructed vegetation and climate were then stacked with those from a longer peat core (i.e., KLSZ-1) to evaluate the vegetation dynamics and associated climate change of the entire Holocene and to examine the delta C-13(cellulose)- and delta O-18(cellulose)-based temperature reconstructions in the same peat. This study shows that vegetation in Kelashazi valley was dominated by alpine meadows before -8200 cal. yr BP, by taiga forests at similar to 8200-similar to 5600 cal. yr BP, and by an expansion of alpine meadows since similar to 5600 cal. yr BP. This study also examined the vegetation dynamics and associated climate in the context of the entire Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas. Our examination suggests that the forest expansion in high elevations was initiated when the temperature reached a threshold level during the early Holocene, and the forest expansion in low elevations (i.e., below the down treeline) was initiated when the moisture reached a threshold level during the middle Holocene or even late Holocene. It is also notable that the forest expansion at low elevations appears to have been longitude-dependent, i.e., time transgressive eastward. A possible mechanism to explain the longitude-dependency is that a gradual shrinking trend of the Siberian High linked to the Holocene increase in winter insolation allowed the domination of the water vapor-enriched Westerlies to gradually encroach eastward.

As a consequence, many still existing glacier and permafrost landscapes probably transform within decades into new landscapes of bare bedrock, loose debris, sparse vegetation, numerous new lakes and steep slopes with slowly degrading permafrost. These new landscapes are likely to persist for centuries if not millennia to come. During variable but mostly extended future time periods, such new landscapes will be characterized by pronounced disequilibria within their geo- and ecosystems. This especially involves long-term stability reduction of steep/icy mountain slopes as a slow and delayed reaction to stress redistribution following de-buttressing by vanishing glaciers and to changes in mechanical strength and hydraulic permeability caused by permafrost degradation. Thereby, the probability of far-reaching flood waves from large mass movements into lakes systematically increases with the formation of many new lakes and systems of lakes in dose neighborhood to. or even directly at the foot of, so-affected slopes. Results of recent studies in the Swiss Alps are reviewed and complemented with examples from the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and the Mount Everest region in Nepal. Hot spots of future hazards from potential flood waves caused by large rock falls into new lakes can already now be recognized. To this end, integrated spatial information on glacier/permafrost evolution and lake formation can be used together with scenario-based models for rapid mass movements, impact waves and flood propagation. The resulting information must then be combined with exposure and vulnerability considerations related to settlements and infrastructure. This enables timely planning of risk reduction options. Such risk reduction options consist of two components: Mitigation of hazards, which in the present context are due to effects from climate change, and reduction in consequences, which result from societal conditions and changes. Hazard mitigation may include artificial lake drainage or lake-level lowering and flood retention, optimally in connection with multipurpose structures for hydropower production and/or irrigation. Reduction in damage potential (exposure, vulnerability) can be accomplished by installing early-warning systems, adapting spatial planning and/or by improving preparedness of local people and institutions.

J	Whitledge, GW; Hayward, RS				Whitledge, GW; Hayward, RS			Determining sampling date interval for precise in situ estimates of cumulative food consumption by fishes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We tested the influence of sampling date interval (SDI) on precision of in situ estimates of cumulative food consumption by fishes. Daily rations of stream-dwelling green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) and impoundment-dwelling bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were estimated for 30 consecutive days using a low-effort procedure. Cumulative consumption by each species over the 30-day period (and 95% CIs) was estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. The effect of SDI on cumulative consumption estimates was examined by calculating cumulative consumption for SDIs of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, and 30 days; the 1-day SDI served as a standard for evaluation of other SDIs. Cumulative consumption estimates began to fall outside the 95% CI for the 1-day SDI at SDIs of 3-4 days and did so with with increasing frequency as SDI increased. Error in estimating cumulative consumption was almost always less than or equal to 15% relative to the 1-day SDI standard at SDIs of 5 days or less but was as high as 26 and 39% at SDIs of 6 and 7 days, respectively. Our results suggest that sampling at least every 5 days may be required to obtain precise estimates of cumulative consumption by fishes in lotic systems and small impoundments.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2000	57	6					1131	1138		10.1139/cjfas-57-6-1131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-6-1131													WOS:000087703800003

Abiotic characteristics and microalgal dynamics in South Africa's largest estuarine lake during a wet to dry transitional phase	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The summer of 2012/2013 signified the end of the dry phase in the St Lucia estuarine system that lasted for over a decade. The increased rainfall coupled with the partial re-connection of the Mfolozi River to the estuarine system shifted St Lucia to a new limnetic state. With the increased availability of habitat due to the higher water level, it was expected that microalgal biomass and abundance would rapidly increase through recruitment from refuge areas i.e. South Lake and new introductions. Microalgal and physico-chemical data were collected at three sites within the Mfolozi/Msunduzi River and at 23 sites within the St Lucia estuarine system between June 2014 and February 2015. Results from this study indicated low biomass for both phytoplankton (<5 1.1g l(-1)) and microphytobenthos (<60 mg m-2) because of local and external drivers. These included limited nutrient and light availability, variable water residence times, biomass dilution and heterogeneity of the sediment. The high spatio-temporal variability limits the effectiveness of using the microalgal communities to detect change in the estuarine lake. In addition, significant intrasystem differences were observed between the three main lake basins and Narrows, due to the influence of the freshwater input from the Mfolozi River. This study provides insight into the spatio-temporal variability of physico-chemical conditions and microalgal communities during the 2014-2015 limnetic state. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hon, K; Orr, T				Hon, Ken; Orr, Tim			Hydrothermal hexahydrite spherules erupted during the 2008-2010 summit eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Small (1-3 mm), hollow spherules of hexahydrite have been collected falling out of the magmatic gas plume downwind of Kilauea's summit vent. The spherules were observed on eight separate occasions during 2009- 2010 when a lake of actively spattering lava was present similar to 150200 m below the rim of the vent. The shells of the spherules have a fine bubbly foam structure less than 0.1 mm thick, composed almost entirely of hexahydrite [MgSO(4)center dot 6H(2)O] Small microspherules of lava (< 5 mu m across) along with mineral and rock fragments from the magmatic plume adhered to the outside of the hexahydrite spherules. Phase relationships and the particulate matter in the magmatic plume indicate that the spherules originated as a bubbly solution injected into and mixed with the magmatic plume. The most likely mechanism for production of hexahydrite spherules is boiling of MgSO(4)-saturated meteoric water in the walls of the conduit above the surface of the lava lake. Solfataric sulfates may thus be recycled and reinjected into the plume, creating particulates of sulfate minerals that can be distributed far from their original source.

J	Jellyman, DJ; Glova, GJ; Todd, PR				Jellyman, DJ; Glova, GJ; Todd, PR			Movements of shortfinned eels, Anguilla australis, in Lake Ellesmere, New Zealand: Results from mark-recapture studies and sonic tracking	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Movements of non-migratory and migratory shortfinned eels in Lake Ellesmere, New Zealand, were studied from recaptures of streamer-tagged eels and tracking of eels tagged with sonic transmitters. Of the 9956 streamer-tagged eels, 1982 were recaptured by commercial fishers over 5 years, some as many as 7 times. Most non-migratory eels were recaptured at, or adjacent to, their original capture site, although some eels had moved to 11 of 12 regions in the lake within 3 weeks of tagging. Transplanted non-migratory eels showed a tendency to home to their original capture site. Although most eels do not appear to move more than a few kilometres they are capable of periodic extensive movements; we conclude that there is a single population in the lake. The mobile portion of the population will be important in repopulating areas where eel numbers have been reduced by commercial fishing. Migrating eels always congregated at Taumutu, the area where the lake is artificially opened to the sea. There was some evidence that extensive movement of sonic-tagged eels resulted from handling during tagging, and movement of eels effectively ceased at water temperatures less than or equal to 12 degrees C when eels remained in deeper parts of the lake, probably to over-winter.																			0028-8330					SEP	1996	30	3					371	381		10.1080/00288330.1996.9516724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1996.9516724													WOS:A1996VL66200009

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Studies were carried out in a man-made reservoir that was undergoing restoration using selective hypolimnetic withdrawal (Plawniowice reservoir, Southern Poland). The aim of the research was to assess the changes in the composition of oligochaete fauna in relation to water quality and to estimate whether indices based on oligochaetes may be useful in the assessment of a reservoir's recovery from eutrophication. Samples were collected in the first, fifth, and eighth year of the restoration during the summer stratification at 22 sites along six transects that covered depths from 2 to 15 m. The results of the survey indicated an improvement in some physical and chemical water parameters in respect to those during the period prior to the restoration measures. The present study showed an increase in the oligochaete diversity and a decrease in their abundance accompanied by a shift toward a larger share of taxa that are characteristic of mesotrophic and oligotrophic conditions. This study detected slow changes in the values of the trophic indices based on oligochaetes toward mesotrophic conditions. Discriminant analysis, performed using stepwise forward selection, demonstrated a good separation of samples from 2004 and 2011 according to trophic condition (TC) and biotic quality index (BQI) indices. The present data shows that metrics based on Oligochaeta may be useful for detecting changes in the trophic status.					; Kostecki, Maciej/AAC-8826-2019	Krodkiewska, Mariola/0000-0003-1323-4239; Kostecki, Maciej/0000-0002-2388-2718													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2015	187	9								10.1007/s10661-015-4787-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4787-9								26311264					WOS:000360313000046

Eighty-seven 24-hour, level-weighted composite samples were collected during a variety of catchment states (rain, snowmelt, baseflow), and TP concentrations were regressed against flow or precipitation in an attempt to mitigate the considerable loading estimation bias arising from event-scale hysteresis. Annual average TP loads were estimated for 2008 to 2012 and were the highest from the Desjardins Canal (17.4 kg/d to 65.6 kg/d), followed by Red Hill Creek (6.4 kg/d to 25.8 kg/d), Grindstone Creek (3.4 kg/d to 33.4 kg/d), and Indian Creek (3.0 kg/d to 7.9 kg/d). Daily TP loads varied by three orders of magnitude between wet and dry conditions, with storm events driving peak daily loads in the urban watersheds, and spring freshet in the agricultural and wetland influenced watersheds. Areal TP loads were higher from the urban relative to the agricultural watersheds. This study demonstrated that the tributaries did not meet the Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan (HH RAP) initial target of 65 kg/d in 2008 to 2011 but did in 2012. Comparison of three loading methods emphasized the vital role of characterizing TP concentrations during high flow events. The higher resolution TP loads generated in this study will assist the HH RAP in forming additional remedial actions in the watersheds for delisting the Hamilton Harbour Area of Concern.

J	Umino, S; Horio, A				Umino, S; Horio, A			Multistage magma mixing revealed in phenocryst zoning of the Yunokuchi Pumice, Akagi Volcano, Japan	JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY												Detailed study of the texture and chemical zoning of phenocrysts in a plinian fall deposit (Yunokuchi Pumice) from Akagi Volcano, Japan, permits reconstruction of the subvolcanic magma chamber Hypersthene phenocrysts are complexly zoned; some have spongy cellular textures whereas others exhibit simple reverse zoning. Augite phenocrysts have texturally similar cores but Al and Ti vs mg-number zoning patterns are correlatable with hypersthene cores. Most plagioclase phenocrysts have a uniform calcic core enclosed by a normally zoned rim; others have variable An contents and mottled textures. These characteristics and melt (glass) compositions suggest a complex, multistage mixing of low-T (940-960 degrees C) highly silicic and high-T (980-1060 degrees C) less silicic magmas. Stratigraphic variations of the phenocryst types show that the earlier erupted magma inherited phenocrysts from more high-T magma components. We propose the presence of an inhomogeneous mushy chamber filled with a highly silicic magma which was recharged periodically by less silicic magmas. The large viscosity contrast and density balance of the new magma relative to the mush controlled the efficiency of mixing and the position of emplacement of the high-T magma in the mush. Tapping the chamber first expelled the fluidal mixed magma, followed by progressive erosion of the mush as the eruption continued.																			0022-3530					JAN	1998	39	1					101	124		10.1093/petrology/39.1.101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/petrology/39.1.101													WOS:000071931500004

Mapping the summer 2017 surface water circulation of Picton Bay, ON	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												On March 24, 2017, a fuel spill from a partially submerged barge in Picton Bay contaminated the source water for the drinking water supply of the local township. Immediately after the spill, management decisions regarding the water intake plant operations were made based on contaminant observations and projected wind conditions. From a management perspective, it is essential to understand all the dynamical forcing for a system to direct the best decision-making but, unfortunately, there are no historical observations of currents in Picton Bay or any in-depth numerical modelling studies that have established the circulation patterns or hydrodynamics of the bay. This paper presents observations of surface speeds and drifter pathways collected using Lagrangian drifters and compares the observations to the velocity field estimates from a wind forced three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Surface drifters were deployed from July to September and moved southwest into the bay during each deployment with almost no tendency to turn and drift out of the bay. Model simulations indicated that currents in the bay are sensitive to small-scale local winds and that a boundary current exists that connects the spill site to the area of the water intake pipes in wind conditions that are to the southwest or southeast.																			1201-3080					MAY	2019	54	2					115	126		10.2166/wqrj.2018.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2018.011													WOS:000466558700004

Halophilic Archaea determined from geothermal steam vent aerosols	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Hydrothermal vents, known as 'fumaroles', are ubiquitous features of geothermal areas. Although their geology has been extensively characterized, little is known about the subsurface microbial ecology of fumaroles largely because of the difficulty in collecting sufficient numbers of cells from boiling steam water for DNA extraction and culture isolation. Here we describe the first collection, molecular analysis and isolation of microbes from fumarole steam waters in Russia (Kamchatka) and the USA (Hawaii, New Mexico, California and Wyoming). Surprisingly, the steam vent waters from all the fumaroles contained halophilic Archaea closely related to the Haloarcula spp. found in non-geothermal salt mats, saline soils, brine pools and salt lakes around the world. Microscopic cell counting estimated the cell dispersal rate at approximately 1.6 x 10(9) cells year(-1) from a single fumarole. We also managed to enrich microbes in high-salt media from every vent sample, and to isolate Haloarcula from a Yellowstone vent in a 20% salt medium after a month-long incubation, demonstrating both salt tolerance and viability of cells collected from high-temperature steam. Laboratory tests determined that microbes enriched in salt media survived temperatures greater than 75 degrees C for between 5 and 30 min during the collection process. Hawaiian fumaroles proved to contain the greatest diversity of halophilic Archaea with four new lineages that may belong to uncultured haloarchaeal genera. This high diversity may have resulted from the leaching of salts and minerals through the highly porous volcanic rock, creating a chemically complex saline subsurface.																			1462-2912					JUN	2008	10	6					1582	1590		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01574.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01574.x								18331336					WOS:000255701900018

Water in the city: visitation of animal wildlife to garden water sources and urban lakes	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Providing garden water sources (e.g., ponds, bird baths) has become a popular and strongly promoted form of wildlife-friendly gardening, yet evidence of their use by animals is scarce and limited to a few taxa and water source types. We examined the prevalence, variety and potential value to animal wildlife of supplementary water provided within gardens of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, using an online questionnaire and field observations of wildlife visitation to urban water sources during summer 2021. Over 70% of 105 questionnaire respondents indicated the presence of at least one water source in their garden and almost 50% had two or more. Bird baths, ground water-bowls and ponds were the most common water source types provided. During 207 h of field observation, we recorded a total of 43 taxa (birds, insects, mammals, amphibians, reptiles) visiting urban lakes and garden birth baths, ponds and ground water-bowls. Taxa richness was similar at urban lakes (30) and garden water sources (27), although approximately 50% of the taxa recorded in each location were unique to that location. Visitation rates of smaller-bodied wildlife did not differ between lakes and gardens, nor among individual water source types. Multivariate analyses indicated insect assemblages visiting lakes did not differ from those visiting garden water sources, and small bird assemblages did not differ among each water source type. These results demonstrate garden water sources, especially for smaller-bodied animals, can supplement the wildlife values contributed by urban lake systems, and should continue to be promoted as an effective conservation action.					; Rooney, Nicola/ISV-0609-2023; Close, Paul/C-7649-2013	rooney, nicola/0000-0001-9629-1700; Close, Paul/0000-0002-7323-0304; Van Helden, Bronte/0000-0003-2952-4193; 													1083-8155	1573-1642				OCT	2023	26	5					1413	1425		10.1007/s11252-023-01391-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-023-01391-3		JUN 2023											WOS:001010694900001
J	Bevington, AR; Menounos, B				Bevington, Alexandre R.; Menounos, Brian			Accelerated change in the glaciated environments of western Canada revealed through trend analysis of optical satellite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The retreat of mountain glaciers affects mountain hazards and hydrology, and new methods are needed to rapidly map glacier retreat at planetary scales. We automatically map 14,329 glaciers (30,063 km(2)) in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, from 1984 to 2020 using satellite image archives from the Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 missions and reveal an acceleration in area loss that commenced in 2011. Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000's. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984-2010] and late [2011-2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of-49 +/- 7 km(2) a(-1) [early] and -340 +/- 40 km(2) a(-1) [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 +/- 5.6 fragments a(-1) to 88 +/- 39 fragments a(-1). About 1141 glaciers fell below our 0.05 km2 detection limit and so disappeared from our database, representing a loss of 8%. Proglacial lake area growth accelerated from 9.2 +/- 1.1 km(2) a(-1) to 49 +/- 4.5 km(2) a(-1). We also observed an acceleration in the upwards migration of median glacier elevations for clean ice glaciers from 0.31 +/- 0.08 m a(-1) to 4.7 +/- 0.7 m a(-1). Our workflow demonstrates the advantages of annual resolution glacier inventories and contributes towards the implementation of planetary mapping of glaciers and glacier attributes at annual resolution.

Distance decay of similarity, effects of environmental noise and ecological heterogeneity among species in the spatio-temporal dynamics of a dispersal-limited community	ECOGRAPHY												The joint spatial and temporal fluctuations in community structure may be due to dispersal, variation in environmental conditions, ecological heterogeneity among species and demographic stochasticity. These factors are not mutually exclusive, and their relative contribution towards shaping species abundance distributions and in causing species fluctuations have been hard to disentangle. To better understand community dynamics when the exchange of individuals between localities is very low, we studied the dynamics of the freshwater zooplankton communities in 17 lakes located in independent catchment areas, sampled at end of summer from 2002 to 2008 in Norway. We analysed the joint spatial and temporal fluctuations in the community structure by fitting the two-dimensional Poisson lognormal model under a two-stage sampling scheme. We partitioned the variance of the distribution of log abundance for a random species at a random time and location into components of demographic stochasticity, ecological heterogeneity among species, and independent environmental noise components for the different species. Non-neutral mechanisms such as ecological heterogeneity among species (20%) and spatiotemporal variation in the environment (75%) explained the majority of the variance in log abundances. Overdispersion relative to Poisson sampling and demographic stochasticity had a small contribution to the variance (5%). Among a set of environmental variables, lake acidity was the environmental variable that was most strongly related to decay of community similarity in space and time.

J	TREMBLAY, S; RICHARD, Y				TREMBLAY, S; RICHARD, Y			EFFECTS OF ACIDITY ON FISH COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHWESTERN QUEBEC (CANADA)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Surveys of fish populations were conducted on 74 lakes of the Outaouais hydrographic region during the summers of 1985 and 1986 to assess the potential impact of acidity on ichtyologic fauna. Results show that species diversity declined with the increasing acidity. The color of water does not seem to mitigate the adverse effects of acidity. On the contrary, the number of species decreased similarly in both brown lakess (> 30 Hazen) and clear lakes (less-than-or-equal-to 30 Hazen) with the increase of acidity. The species tolerance threshold levels to acidity show that 72% of fish species are no longer captured when pH reaches 5.0, compared to 32% at pH less-than-or-equal-to 5.5. The pH range 5.0 to 5.5 can possibly be regarded as the break point for the occurrence of most fish species in this area. Analysis of the size frequency distributions show that recruitment failures have occurred in acidic waters for walleye and lake trout. We have estimated that anthropogenic acidification is responsible for the loss of more than 10 000 fish populations in the Outaouais area.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	1993	66	3-4					315	331																WOS:A1993KT77500008

Owing to its morphometric features (max. depth 350 m), the water column of L. Garda undergoes complete mixing only in harsh winters. During the period 1991-1995 this was only once, in 1991; in other years the mixing depth lay between 140 to 180 m. There is a correlation between lake volume at overturn with algal abundances and water transparencies. The extent of the overturn appears to control the interannual variations of the algal crop around a baseline trophic status determined by the whole total phosphorus content in the water column. Full understanding of the limnological features of the lake are thus important for the most suitable management practices. Future plans should try to reduce the discharge of sewage into deep waters to a minimum; it is stressed that the only reliable solution for preservation of water quality in deep lakes of this typology is reduction of nutrient loads. As far as L. Garda is concerned, this appears fairly pressing, considering the increase of total phosphorus concentrations in the water column observed since the 1970s.

A total of 49 relevant studies indicate that cyanobacterial blooms are commonly reported on six continents, including Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. Overall, cyanobacterial biomass reported in these reviewed studies falls within the classification of Alert Level 2, which is indicated by chlorophyll-a concentrations exceeded 12 mu g/L. Moreover, the published data also revealed that 59% of the reported microcystins concentrations exceeded the WHO guideline value for safe lifetime consumption of 1 mu g/L. These potential human exposures to cyanobacteria and microcystins are based on the concentrations reported in raw drinking water sources, as a lack of studies have emphasized the detection of microcystins in the treated drinking water or at the last stage of the water treatment process. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the potential health risk associated with the exposure to microcystins contamination in drinking water, as this metabolite is potent and chemically stable. Mitigation measures, including management approaches, physical, chemical, and biological techniques, can be applied to control cyanobacterial blooms and microcystins contamination in drinking water sources.

Previously, only the upper White Cliff Member was recognized in this area within the Lisan Formation. A full section of the Lisan Formation is exposed, including the lower laminated member. Apart from the typical laminated aragonite and clay, this member contains here abundant clastic beds. The typical assemblage of diatoms is present. Aragonite oolites and algal limestones appeared above the Lisan Formation and these may be correlative to the unnamed clastic unit, which was previously defined and found only north of the Dead Sea. These rocks were previously thought to belong to the older Samra Formation. In the southern tip of Lake Lisan, the aragonite facies of the Lisan Formation was determined, with all its typical attributes. The reason for the occurrence of this facies south of the Gypsum Facies, which indicates a higher salinity is that, although the amount of rainfall decreases southward, the portion of the catchment area for the southern tip of Lake Lisan is large enough to compensate for the lower amount of rainfall falling in the area. Thus, the southern catchment may have supplied an amount of freshwater which could be roughly equal to the amount received by some northern segments.																			0021-2164	2223-8972					1980	29	3					182	189																WOS:A1980LA27500002

The semen of mature fishes collected from Al-Radwania man-made lakes during 2015 spring spawning season were used in this study. The semen was collected by manual abdominal stripping without using any hormones or anesthetizes and its sperms were tested for surviving and activity throw cryopreserving process in liquid Nitrogen using two different extenders (Zhang & Liu vs. Calcium-free Hank's Balanced Salt Solution) with methanol in 10% as cryoprotectant for the first extender and glycerol in the same percent with the second and considering the motility rate as indicator for survival and activity during prefreezing and post thawing processes. The obtained quantities of semen ranged between 1-9 ml with mean volumes of 4.6 ml. Sperm motility rate using Zhang & Liu with 10% methanol was better in prefreezing diluents over Hank's, its motility rates ranged between 80-95% with mean 87.5%, while Hank's sperms motility results ranged between 50-95% with mean 69%. This situation was inverted after freezing and thawing, because Zhang and Liu solution lost 57.5% of its sperms motility while Hank's with glycerol lost only 40%, thus Hank's sperms motility mean reached 50% while Zhang and Liu was 30%. From these results we can infer that Shabout's sperms has the ability to be cryopreserved in liquid Nitrogen and c-f Hank's solution with 10% glycerol as cryoprotectant better than Zhang and Liu with methanol for long-term cryopreservation though, we can use Zhang and Liu solution also for short-term Shabout's sperms cool preservation.

Some of the lakes are fed mainly by glacier meltwater and others by precipitation and groundwater. Past changes in the environments of these lakes differed because of differences in lake hydrological regimes and the complex pattern of climate change on the TP. Here we present records of scanning XRF, inorganic carbon (IC) concentration n-alkanoic acid average chain length (ACL) and percent aquatic inputs (Paq) in sediment cores from two non-glaciated lakes on the central TP (Dagze Co and Jiang Co), which span the past 19,000 years. We used these measures to investigate past changes in catchment hydrology, climate and environment. Variations in the concentration of Ti and other lithogenic elements at the two sites were influenced mainly by surface runoff, which is supported by the variation of IC, Ca/(Al, Ti, Fe) (reflecting authigenic carbonate precipitation), Rb/Sr (a chemical weathering proxy), and ACL and Paq. We attribute variations in surface runoff to changes in the precipitation/evaporation ratio, caused by the pattern of climate change on the central TP since the late Pleistocene. During the late Pleistocene, stronger runoff (indicated by higher Ti, higher Rb/Sr and Paq, lower IC, Ca/(Al, Ti, Fe) and ACL) likely resulted from lower temperatures. Lower runoff during the Holocene may reflect intensified evaporation caused by higher temperatures. Comparison with records from glaciated lakes in the region reveals opposite trends in catchment hydrology. Overall, our results suggest that since the late Pleistocene the central TP was influenced mainly by the Indian Summer Monsoon.					梁, 洁/GRY-6915-2022; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018; Wang, Mingda/C-7736-2011	Hou, Juzhi/0000-0002-8512-5739; Wang, Mingda/0000-0002-8081-755X													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2017	58	2					257	273		10.1007/s10933-017-9976-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-017-9976-9													WOS:000404687500010

Forms consisted of a small littoral resident, mean size 21.7 cm, and a large profundal resident, mean size 53.9 cm. Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicated that seven of eight haplotypes were diagnostic for either the littoral or profundal fish, with 66.6% of the variation being found within form groupings. Pairwise tests of microsatellite data indicated significant differences in nine of 12 loci and a significant difference between the forms across all tested loci. Molecular variation was partitioned to 84.1% within and 15.9% between forms and suggestive of either restricted interbreeding over time or different allopatric origins. Stable isotope signatures were also significantly different, with the profundal fish having higher delta(13)C and delta(15)N values than the littoral fish. Overlap and separation, respectively, in the range of form delta(13)C and delta(15)N signatures indicated that carbon was obtained from similar sources, but that forms fed at different trophic levels. Littoral fish relied on aquatic insects, predominantly chironomids. Profundal fish were largely piscivorous, including cannibalism. Predominantly empty stomachs and low per cent nitrogen muscle-tissue composition among profundal fish further indicated that the feeding activity was limited to the winter when ice-cover increases the density of available prey at depth. Results provide evidence of significant differences between the modal groups, with origins in both genetics and ecology.																			0906-6691					SEP	2009	18	3					445	460		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00362.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00362.x													WOS:000268924900011

There are few studies that quantify tackle loss for recreational fisheries. Tackle loss from large recreational lake fisheries in Minnesota is unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine tackle loss for five large lake fisheries targeting walleye Sander vitreus in Minnesota by means of creel surveys an to estimate recent cumulative losses. Mean rates of tackle loss were low: 0.0127/h for lures, 0.0081/h for large sinkers, 0.0057/h for small sinkers, 0.0247/h for jigs, and 0.0257/h for hooks. Many anglers lost no fishing tackle on a fishing trip. The estimated total loss of tackle for the five water bodies in the summer of 2004 was 214,811 items. Over 100,000 lead-based items were estimated to have been lost, representing about I metric ton of lead. Assuming 2004 lead tackle loss rates, estimates of cumulative lead item loss for Lake of the Woods and Mille Lacs and Rainy lakes from 1983 to 2004 were 285,000 (SE = 8,800), 1,033,000 (SE = 39,700), and 211,000 (SE 8,400) items, respectively. In critical wildlife areas with high angling effort or high tackle loss rates, determining the impacts of lead tackle on wildlife would be prudent, and prohibiting the use of lead tackle may be necessary.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2006	26	1					206	212		10.1577/M05-121.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-121.1													WOS:000236430500025

Its wetlands play an important role in generating resources such as water, peat, minerals, plants, animals and recreational areas, which have a central place in the Ukrainian economy. In the mid-1920s, bogs and fens occupied over 3% of the country's area. During the period of collectivization, industrialization and large-scale land reclamation, marshlands fell under powerful pressure. The productivity of most of the drained land remains low, and drainage and reclamation are accompanied by a lowering of the water level in lakes and rivers, peat fires and a decrease in soil fertility. New kinds of wetlands are forming as a result of underflooding caused by poor planning and designing, building defects, the condition of the water economy in urbanized areas, huge water losses in irrigation systems and other factors. A dramatic increase in irrigated land has not brought about the expected increase in agricultural production. Disruption of water exchange processes has resulted in large-scale, severe erosion and salinization of chernozems, the most fertile soils in the south. Problems arising from a combination of irrational use of wetland resources and environmentally negligent policy-and decision-making have led to conflicts at various levels.																					0-7923-4768-4				1997	33						451	470																WOS:000073332500027
J	Reinart, A; Arst, H; Pierson, DC				Reinart, A; Arst, H; Pierson, DC			Optical properties and light climate in Lake Verevi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The optical properties and light climate during the ice-free period in the highly stratified Lake Verevi (Estonia) have been studied together with other lakes in same region since 1994. The upper water layer above the thermoctine belongs to class "moderate" by optical classification of Estonian lakes but can turn "turbid" (concentration of chlorophyll a up to 73 mg m(-3) and total suspended matter up to 13.2 g m(-3)) during late summer blooms. In the blue part of the spectrum, light is mainly attenuated by dissolved organic matter and in red part notably scattering but also absorption by phytoplanktonic pigments effect the spectral distribution of underwater light. Consequently, the underwater light is of greenish-yellow color (550-650 nm). Rapid change in optical properties occurs with an increase of all optically active substances close to thermocline (2.5-6 m). Optical measurements are often hampered beneath this layer so that modeling of the depth distribution of the diffuse attenuation coefficient is an useful compliment to field measurements. K-d,K-PAR ranges from 0.8 to 2.9 m(-1) in the surface layer, and model results suggest that it may be up to 5.8 m(-1) in the optically dense layer. This forms a barrier for light penetration into the hypolimnion.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2005	547						41	49		10.1007/s10750-005-4142-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4142-1													WOS:000232760300005
J	Trafton, KR; Giachetti, T				Trafton, Kathleen R.; Giachetti, Thomas			The morphology and texture of Plinian pyroclasts reflect their lateral sourcing in the conduit	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												We investigated the relationships between the size, shape, density and texture of thousands of juvenile pyroclasts from the Plinian phase of the 1060 CE Glass Mountain eruption of Medicine Lake Volcano (California, USA). Analyzed pyroclasts, which originate from representative beds of both proximal and medial deposits, range from 0.125 mm to several centimeters in diameter. We show that the size, shape, density and texture of juvenile Plinian pyroclasts are intimately interrelated: as the size of pyroclast decreases from 64 mm to 0.125 mm, their shape shifts from equant to tabular to elongate. Moreover, while rounded vesicles dominate the largest clasts, elongate and distorted vesicles become progressively more present with decreasing clast size. Concurrently, clast density continually increases in a sigmoidal way from similar to 0.4 gcm(-3) (>80% porous) in the largest clasts to similar to 1.7-1.9 gcm(-3) (20-30% porous) by 0.125 mm. These observations are identical for both the proximal and medial locations. We show that expansion, compaction and secondary fragmentation did not significantly change the texture of juvenile pyroclasts after fragmentation. The size dependency of density and texture of Plinian pyroclasts is instead interpreted to originate from the lateral position of the magma in the conduit prior to fragmentation: smaller clasts result from higher shearing closer to conduit walls, where greater shear stresses increasingly elongate vesicles and fragment particles in smaller pieces. Moreover, similar to 5% of pyroclasts 1-8 mm in size are likely agglomerates of mono-texture ash particles that sintered within the conduit during or shortly after primary fragmentation. Our work shows that future studies should analyze the full spectrum of clast sizes, from the micron- to centimeter-scale, in order to fully capture the complexity and breadth of eruptive processes across the volcanic conduit.

Strain DB-3(T) grew optimally at 30 degrees C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 2.0-3.0% (w/v) NaCI. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DB-3T fell within the Glade comprising the type strains of species of the genus Psychroflexus. Strain DB-3(T) exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 93.2-96.9% to the type strains of species of the genus Psychroflexus. Strain DB-3(T) contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-17:0 3-OH as the major fatty acids. The major or significant amounts of polar lipids detected in strain DB-3(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified aminolipid and seven unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content was 34.7 mol%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with phylogenetic distinctiveness, revealed that strain DB-3(T) is separated from recognized species of the genus Psychroflexus. On the basis of the data presented, strain DB-3(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Psychroflexus, for which the name Psychroflexus aestuariivivens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DB-3(T) (=KCTC 52037(T)=NBRC 111757(T)).

Vegetation response to wildfire and climate forcing in a Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forest over the past 2500 years	HOLOCENE												Wildfire is a ubiquitous disturbance agent in subalpine forests in western North America. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contortavar.latifolia), a dominant tree species in these forests, is largely resilient to high-severity fires, but this resilience may be compromised under future scenarios of altered climate and fire activity. We investigated fire occurrence and post-fire vegetation change in a lodgepole pine forest over the past 2500 years to understand ecosystem responses to variability in wildfire and climate. We reconstructed vegetation composition from pollen preserved in a sediment core from Chickaree Lake, Colorado, U.S.A. (1.5-ha lake), in Rocky Mountain National Park, and compared vegetation change to an existing fire history record. Pollen samples (n= 52) were analyzed to characterize millennial-scale and short-term (decadal-scale) changes in vegetation associated with multiple high-severity fire events. Pollen assemblages were dominated byPinusthroughout the record, reflecting the persistence of lodgepole pine. Wildfires resulted in significant declines inPinuspollen percentages, but pollen assemblages returned to pre-fire conditions after 18 fire events, within c.75 years. The primary broad-scale change was an increase inPicea,Artemisia, Rosaceae, andArceuthobiumpollen types, around 1155 calibrated years before present. The timing of this change is coincident with changes in regional pollen records, and a shift toward wetter winter conditions identified from regional paleoclimate records. Our results indicate the overall stability of vegetation in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests during climate changes and repeated high-severity fires. Contemporary deviations from this pattern of resilience could indicate future recovery challenges in these ecosystems.

Cryptoprocta spelea (Carnivora: Eupleridae): What Did It Eat and How Do We Know?	JOURNAL OF MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION												The extent to which Madagascar's Holocene extinct lemurs fell victim to nonhuman predators is poorly understood. Madagascar's Holocene predator guild included several now-extinct species, i.e., crocodiles, carnivorans, and raptors. Here we focus on mammalian carnivory, specifically the roles of Cryptoprocta spelea and its still-extant but smaller-bodied sister taxon, C. ferox, the fosa. Cryptoprocta spelea was the largest carnivoran on Madagascar during the Quaternary. We ask whether some extinct lemurs exceeded the upper prey-size limits of C. spelea. We use univariate and multivariate phylogenetic generalized least squares regression models to re-evaluate the likely body mass of C. spelea. Next, we compare characteristics of the forelimb bones of C. ferox and C. spelea to those of other stealth predators specializing on small, mixed, and large-bodied prey. Finally, we examine humeri, femora, crania, and mandibles of extinct lemurs from six sites in four ecoregions of Madagascar to identify damage likely made by predators. We test the relative prevalence of carnivory by mammals, raptors, and crocodiles at different sites and ecoregions. Our data reveal that crocodiles, raptors, and the largest of Madagascar's mammalian predators, C. spelea, all preyed on large lemurs. Cryptoprocta opportunistically consumed lemurs weighing up to similar to 85kg. Its forelimb anatomy would have facilitated predation on large-bodied prey. Social hunting may have also enhanced the ability of C. spelea to capture large, arboreal primates. Cryptoprocta carnivory is well represented at cave and riverine sites and less prevalent at lake and marsh sites, where crocodylian predation dominates.

J	Oroud, IM				Oroud, IM			Temperature and evaporation dynamics of saline solutions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An analytic procedure is presented to investigate the response of temperature in and evaporation from saline solutions whose activity coefficients are subject to dynamic changes. The temperature change (gamma) with respect to changes in the activity coefficient is found to be a strong function of the saturation vapor pressure at the temperature of the saline solution and the transfer coefficients for water vapor and sensible heat. Results show that gamma increases appreciably as the activity coefficient (beta) departs further from unity. As the activity coefficient approaches unity, gamma becomes quite small particularly when both the saline solution temperature and the transfer coefficients decrease. For a given change in the activity coefficient, the largest temperature response is experienced during the summer months. The procedure developed in this paper is applied to the current chemical composition of the Dead Sea to examine the sensitivities of its temperature and evaporation rate due to the alteration of its activity coefficient during the past 40 years. Results show that currently evaporation from the Dead Sea (beta approximate to 0.67) is about 175 mm year(-1) less than the values prior to 1960 (beta approximate to 0.75).

J	Obaidat, MM				Obaidat, Mohammad M.			Seroprevalence and risk factors for Campylobacter jejuni seropositivity in Jordan	INFECTIOUS DISEASES												Background: This is the first large-scale cross-sectional study to examine Campylobacter jejuni seropositivity in Jordan. Methods: A total of 368 serum samples from nine governorates of Jordan were tested for IgA and IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay along with data collection to determine and rank possible risk factors by logistic regression analyses. Results: The results showed that the rate of seroprevalence is 13.9%. Using chi-square test, six factors were significantly associated with C. jejuni seropositivity (p <= .05) including age, drinking raw milk, drinking spring lake water, small ruminant ownership, and dairy cow ownership; meanwhile, drinking filtered water was a protective factor. Chi-square test showed that people <= 19 years old and >= 60 years old had significantly higher seropositivity than other age groups. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that people drinking raw milk had higher odds (adjusted OR= 4.6, 95% CI 2.4-8.8, p-value <.001) for positivity compared with people who do not drink raw milk. Meanwhile, people who own a small ruminant had higher odds (adjusted OR= 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.8, p-value = .05) when compared with people who do not own a small ruminant. Conclusion: This study concludes that raw milk consumption and ruminant ownership are risk factors of campylobacter infection in Jordan. Thus, awareness regarding the adverse health consequences from raw milk consumption should be addressed, and campylobacteriosis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of diarrhoea cases in farmers and their children. Further investigation of Campylobacter infection among younger age groups is recommended.

However, because sodium chloride, the major component of salt, is soluble in water, it has been thought unlikely that any trace of salt would remain in the pottery after a long period of time. A new methodology for retrieval of water-insoluble (retainable) chloride ion trapped within a pottery matrix is presented as a method for detecting previous use of the pottery for salt making. Simulated salt-making pottery was used to make salt by repeatedly boiling seawater over a fire. After chloride had been extracted with distilled water, to mimic the removal of chloride by natural waters such as rainwater and groundwater, an aqueous ammonium fluoride solution was shown to be capable of extracting chloride ions remaining in the pottery. A chloride-selective electrode was used to quantify the amount of extracted chloride in the presence of fluoride. This method was then successfully applied to excavated Japanese pottery vessels suspected of having been used for making salt. Identification of retainable chloride in pottery can offer insights into salt trading networks, which reflect the growth and affluence of an ancient society. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In interstitial water Zn and Pb join the pathway of R.

J	Xie, P				Xie Ping			Biological mechanisms driving the seasonal changes in the internal loading of phosphorus in shallow lakes	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES												Because of the obvious importance of P as a nutrient that often accelerates growth of phytoplankton (including toxic cyanobacteria) and therefore worsens water quality, much interest has been devoted to P exchange across the sediment-water interface. Generally, the release mode of P from the sediment differed greatly between shallow and deep lakes, and much of the effort has been focused on iron and oxygen, and also on the relevant environmental factors, for example, turbulence and decomposition, but a large part of the P variation in shallow lakes remains unexplained. This paper reviews experimental and field studies on the mechanisms of P release from the sediment in the shallow temperate (in Europe) and subtropical (in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China) lakes, and it is suggested that pH rather than DO might be more important in driving the seasonal dynamics of internal P loading in these shallow lakes, i.e., intense photosynthesis of phytoplankton increases pH of the lake water and thus may increase pH of the surface sediment, leading to enhanced release of P (especially iron-bound P) from the sediment. Based on the selective pump of P (but not N) from the sediment by algal blooms, it is concluded that photosynthesis which is closely related to eutrophication level is the driving force for the seasonal variation of internal P loading in shallow lakes. This is a new finding. Additionally, the selective pump of P from the sediment by algal blooms not only explains satisfactorily why both TP and PO4-P in the hypereutrophic Lake Donghu declined significantly since the mid-1980s when heavy cyanobacterial blooms were eliminated by the nontraditional biomanipulation (massive stocking of the filter-feeding silver and bighead carps), but also explains why TP in European lakes decreased remarkably in the spring clear-water phase with less phytoplankton during the seasonal succession of aquatic communities or when phytoplankton biomass was decreased by traditional biomanipulation. Compared with deep lakes, wax and wane of phytoplankton due to alternations in the ecosystem structure is also able to exert significant influences on the P exchange at the sediment-water interface in shallow lakes. In other words, biological activities are also able to drive P release from sediments, and such a static P release process is especially more prominent in eutrophic shallow lakes with dense phytoplankton.

J	Catling, PM				Catling, Paul M.			COLEANTHUS SUBTILIS (POACEAE), NEW TO NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, AND ITS STATUS IN NORTH AMERICA	RHODORA												A floristic survey of a polje lakebed, which is full in the spring but drains completely as the season progresses, revealed a community of small mud-bottom plants including the globally rare Coleanthus subtilis, not previously recorded from Northwest Territories, Canada. The newly discovered site is 1077 miles NNW of its nearest North American location in southern British Columbia, which is the northern edge of a region of occurrence including southern British Columbia and the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. The lakebed flora included four zones of vascular plants. Coleanthus subtilis was confined to the lowest level mud-bottom community, which had been exposed for the shortest period and included a rich assemblage of annuals including Juncus bufonius, Limosella aquatica, and Ranunculus hyperboreus. The lakebed flora included mostly widespread boreal species, and C. subtilis may be included in this category. It appears restricted to specific montane and boreal areas by its requirement of pronounced seasonal inundation in a cool climate. Coleanthus subtilis may have persisted at the Washington and British Columbia locations, near the limit of the continuous montane glaciation, since early postglacial times. The occurrence in Northwest Territories may be either a result of dispersal from unglaciated areas of Beringia nearby to the west or from the south. Although it has sometimes been considered introduced in the United States parts of its North American range, it is here considered native at all of its North American sites on the basis of: (1) its restricted and unusual habitat; (2) global rarity; (3) suffusive rarity, which is known to lead to mistaken assumptions of introduction; (4) occurrence in botanically rich regions and close association with rare native species; (5) relatively early year of collection; (6) distribution corresponding to a well recognized native pattern; (7) lack of evidence of spread to anthropogenic habitats; and (8) the fact that it is easily overlooked by early collectors as a result of only appearing at intervals of several years when water levels have dropped sufficiently.																			0035-4902	1938-3401				JAN-MAR	2009	111	945					109	119		10.3119/08-8.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3119/08-8.1													WOS:000266214100003

Ponds Regent, Tovarys, Dremliny, Horusicky and Bezdrev were checked in autumns 2000-2001. Seven specimens of marketable common carp were sampled from every pond for analyses of muscle, liver, kidney and gonads. Content of Hg, As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn was checked in fish tissues and in bottom sediments. Contents of metals in tissues of marketable common carp ranged below the hygienic limits valid for the respective metals in the Czech Republic. There was one exception, a slightly increased content of nickel (above 0.5 mg/kg) in muscle of 2 common carp specimens. No significant difference was found among the ponds in content of Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni and Cu in fish muscle. Significantly higher (P < 0.01) values of Hg and Zn were found in muscle of common carp from Tovarys pond compared to values found in other ponds. Significantly higher arsenic content (P < 0.01) was found in muscle of common carp from Dremliny and Bezdrev ponds, compared to those found in common carp from Regent pond. Significantly higher (P < 0.01) Hg content was detected in muscle, of Cd and Zn in kidney, of Cu in liver compared to contents of these metals in other tissues. Significantly higher content (P < 0.01) of copper and zinc was found in eggs compared to testes. Content of metals in dry matter of bottom sediment from the ponds under study ranged within the interval characteristic for relatively not loaded ponds under the conditions of Czech Republic. Increased content of Pb, Cu and Zn was registered only in bottom sediment of Tovarys pond. This paper contributes to the assessment of quality of common carp as the main marketable fish in the Czech Republic. It contributes to the strategy of food safety.

Here, a high-resolution, sedimentary diatom record covering the past similar to 17,500 years was retrieved from Lake Moon, a small, hydrologically closed crater lake in the remote central part of the Great Khingan Mountain Range in NE China. We compare diatom changes with geochemical data from the same core, and with regional palynological and dust deposition records, to better understand the influences of long-term environmental and climatic variability on aquatic ecosystems in this climatically sensitive region. Several abrupt and pronounced shifts in dominance among diatom taxa corresponded to marked fluctuations in the climate regime since the last deglaciation. During the close of the Last Glacial Period, a series of short-lived diatom shifts that were indicative of an increase in nutrients, signaled the transition from the cold period of the Heinrich event 1 (similar to 17,500-similar to 14,700 cal yr BP) to the warmer Bolling - Allerod interstadial period (similar to 14,700-similar to 12,900 cal yr BP). The onset of the cold Younger Dryas period was marked by a brief rise to dominance of benthic taxa (similar to 12,900-similar to 11,800 cal yr BP), followed by a pronounced lake ecosystem shift to a new trophic state at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (similar to 11,800-similar to 9900 cal yr BP), evidenced by an abrupt rise to dominance of several eutrophic diatom indicators (e.g. Cyclostephanos dubius, Aulacoseira ambigua and Stephanodiscus parvus). This nearly complete compositional turnover was indicative of an increase in phosphorus supply to the lake with the onset of a warmer and moister climate and an increased frequency of strong dust storms. During the mid-Holocene (similar to 6000 cal yr BP), a striking increase in the relative abundance of Discostella pseudostelligera and Asterionella formosa, at the expense of previously dominant eutrophic indicators, signified another lake ecosystem change from well-mixed, turbid and phosphorus-rich conditions to a lower nutrient state with longer open-water periods and increased thermal stability. The turnover to oligotrophic diatom taxa was likely in response to variations in seasonal temperature, precipitation and dust deposition. The diatom shifts of Lake Moon during the past similar to 17,500 years were directly or indirectly mediated by climate change that affected thermal stratification, productivity, lake level and trophic state. Our results indicate that climate change had an overarching control on aquatic ecosystem changes in the mountain regions of NE China since the last deglaciation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Post-glacial dispersal patterns of Pyganodon grandis (Bivalvia: Unionidae) into the lower Great Lakes watershed	NAUTILUS												Pyganodon grandis (Say, 1829) and other unionid mussels arrived in the Laurentian Great Lakes only after the last glacial maximum in North America. The mussel assemblage is thought to have entered Lake Erie as a wave of expansion from west to east, and moved upstream within tributary rivers. A similar process for most mussels occurred in Lake Ontario, but by eastern species, as the two lake systems are separated by Niagara Falls. Only P. grandis is abundant in both lakes. We applied variation in a fragment of the mtDNA Carboxylase I (COI) gene to identify potential historical paths for P. grandis to enter these watersheds. Nearly complete monomorphy characterized the Lake Ontario population for the most common Lake Erie allele, which is concordant with sequential founder effects across the Great Lakes. A OST including populations from both Lakes, the intervening Niagara River, tributaries of Lake Erie, and additional samples from below the Laurentian Divide, was 0.10. The southern tributaries of Lake Erie had greater genetic diversity, although few haplotypes were shared among regions or even neighboring streams. Tributary and lake populations differed significantly, yet variation across this divide was not significant. This pattern likely arose from stream capture of upper Ohio River tributaries that once flowed south, and then population isolation, with upstream dispersal from Lake Erie limited to the lower reaches.					; Zanatta, David/AAR-6797-2020	Zanatta, David/0000-0002-3174-071X; Burlakova, Lyubov/0000-0002-2995-919X													0028-1344					NOV 27	2019	133	3-4					74	84																WOS:000500081000002

The results are used to test whether or not the land terminating margin at Paakitsoq behaved synchronously with the nearby marine terminating Jakobshavn Isbrx during the Holocene. The radiocarbon dated lake sediment cores indicate that the ice margin retreated to its present position similar to 6.5 ka ago and thereafter maintained a relatively stable configuration similar to the present for >1000 years, despite summer temperatures >2 degrees C higher than today. The lakes became non-glacial after 5.4 cal. ka BP, when the ice margin retreated behind a drainage divide situated similar to 1.5 km inland of the present margin. By this time, Jakobshavn Isbrae had already reached its minimum configuration. The Paakitsoq ice margin remained >1.5 km inland of its present margin until after 240 +/- 20 cal. yr BP; after this time, both Paakitsoq ice margin and Jakobshavn Isbrx reached their Holocene maxima during the later stage of the Little Ice Age. Our results suggest that the present ice margin position at Paakitsoq is relatively stable in a warming climate but after a total retreat of similar to 1.5 km behind the present margin position it may become marine based and more unstable due to marine melting and calving processes.

Last nine-thousand years of temperature variability in Northern Europe	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The threat of future global warming has generated a major interest in quantifying past climate variability on centennial and millennial time-scales. However, palaeoclimatological records are often noisy and arguments about past variability are only possible if they are based on reproducible features in several reliably dated datasets. Here we focus on the last 9000 years, explore the results of 36 Holocene pollen-based July mean and annual mean temperature reconstructions from Northern Europe by stacking them to create summary curves, and compare them with a high-resolution, summary chironomid-based temperature record and other independent palaeoclimate records. The stacked records show that the "Holocene Thermal Maximum" in the region dates to 8000 to 4800 cal yr BP and that the "8.2 event" and the "Little Ice Age" at 500-100 cal yr BP are the clearest cold episodes during the Holocene. In addition, a more detailed analysis of the last 5000 years pinpoints centennial-scale climate variability with cold anomalies at 3800-3000 and 500 100 cal yr BP, a long, warmer period around 2000 cal yr BP, and a marked warming since the mid 19th century. The colder ( warmer) anomalies are associated with increased ( decreased) humidity over the northern European mainland, consistent with the modern high correlation between cold ( warm) and humid ( dry) modes of summer weather in the region. A comparison with the key proxy records reflecting the main forcing factors does not support the hypothesis that solar variability is the cause of the late-Holocene centennial-scale temperature changes. We suggest that the reconstructed anomalies are typical of Northern Europe and their occurrence may be related to the oceanic and atmospheric circulation variability in the North Atlantic-North-European region.

A Review	WATER MANAGEMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT: CASE STUDIES	Water Science and Technology Library											Backwater as a hydrological hazard phenomenon has been scarcely studied scientifically, at both national and international levels. For this reason, this study highlights and describes five types of backwater recorded on the Romanian territory, which posed a great danger to population safety. The backwater caused in Romania is due to ice jams, large dams, misplaced dams, or too small bridges, to poorly designed spillways for large waters built on dams, on dikes in the Danube Delta, etc. The most interesting aspect of the study, at the same time, the novelty of it, is the backwater that is caused on the Buhai brook, which rose over the dam of Lake Ezer, spanned the large water spillway, and flooded the lacustrine water body. This type of backwater was named "spider flow." All types of backwater analyzed in this study were also caused by human activity, mostly by design errors (the backwater on the Buhai brook, within the Danube Delta, on the Suhu River) or by bad flow management (the backwater in the Stanca Costesti Hydro-Energetical Junction). The backwater formed on the Bistrita River has complex causes both natural and anthropic, and it only occurs during the winter.																			0921-092X	1872-4663	978-3-319-79014-5; 978-3-319-79013-8				2018	86						103	123		10.1007/978-3-319-79014-5_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-79014-5_6	10.1007/978-3-319-79014-5												WOS:000463417000007

These cryptoendollithic communities have received attention in microscopy and culture-based studies but have not been examined by molecular approaches. We surveyed the microbial biodiversity of selected cryptoendolithic communities by analyzing clone libraries of rRNA genes amplified from environmental DNA. Over 1,100 individual clones from two types of cryptoendolithic communities, cyanobacterium dominated and lichen dominated, were analyzed. Clones fell into 51 relatedness groups (phylotypes) with a98% rRNA sequence identity (46 bacterial and 5 eucaryal). No representatives of Archaea were detected. No phylotypes were shared between the two classes of endolithic communities studied. Clone libraries based on both types of communities were dominated by a relatively small number of phylotypes that, because of their relative abundance, presumably represent the main primary producers in these communities. In the lichen-dominated community, three rRNA sequences, from a fungus, a green alga, and a chloroplast, of the types known to be associated with lichens, accounted for over 70% of the clones. This high abundance confirms the dominance of lichens in this community. In contrast, analysis of the supposedly cyanobacterium-dominated community indicated, in addition to cyanobacteria, at least two unsuspected organisms that, because of their abundance, may play important roles in the community. These included a member of the u subdivision of the Proteobacteria that potentially is capable of aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis and a distant relative of Deinococcus that defines, along with other Deinococcus-related sequences from Antarctica, a new clade within the Thermus-Deinococcus bacterial phylogenetic division.					; de la Torre, Jose/H-2081-2012	de la Torre, Jose/0000-0002-9553-6048; PACE, NORMAN/0000-0002-8590-5129; 													0099-2240					JUL	2003	69	7					3858	3867		10.1128/AEM.69.7.3858-3867.2003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.7.3858-3867.2003								12839754					WOS:000184082100022

In Finland, Atlantic salmon and both seamigrating and lake-migrating brown trout are stocked as eggs, alevins, fry, parr, and smolt, whereas trout are also stocked as mature fish. The aim of this stocking is to improve catches and to support collapsed spawning stocks. We assessed the success of stocking with brown trout eggs in a study of 17 Finnish boreal forest rivers, of which 9 were subject to egg stocking. All rivers contained some naturally spawning trout. In 16 rivers, including non-stocking years and unstocked rivers, egg stocking did not increase the total (wild and stocked) density of 0-year-old parr. However, those rivers with higher existing trout densities in non-stocking years seemed to benefit most from stocking, suggesting some role of river-specific extrinsic factors affecting egg-to-parr survival. In one river monitored for 14 years, only a weak correlation was found between the total density of 0-year-old parr and the number of eggs stocked. However, in nine parr samples from five rivers, the mean proportion of parr derived from stocked eggs was 40%. The mean survival to first autumn parr of egg-stocked and wild individuals was 1.0 and 3.3%, respectively. Probable reasons for the detected low to moderate impact of egg-stocking are (i) large variation in total parr density between years and rivers, (ii) small number of stocked eggs, (iii) placing egg boxes and egg pockets in unsuitable microhabitats, and (iv) unsuitable emergence time of egg-stocked individuals, or other extrinsic factors creating extra mortality. We recommend field and laboratory experiments to improve and standardize stocking methods, and monitoring the connection of wild spawning stocks and parr recruitment. Finally, we encourage fishery authorities to create clear management goals for threatened wild salmonid stocks.

Timing of exotic, far-traveled boulder emplacement and paleo-outburst flooding in the central Himalayas	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS												Large boulders, ca. 10m in diameter or more, commonly linger in Himalayan river channels. In many cases, their lithology is consistent with source areas located more than 10 km upstream, suggesting long transport distances. The mechanisms and timing of "exotic" boulder emplacement are poorly constrained, but their presence hints at processes that are relevant for landscape evolution and geohazard assessments in mountainous regions. We surveyed river reaches of the Trishuli and Sunkoshi, two trans-Himalayan rivers in central Nepal, to improve our understanding of the processes responsible for exotic boulder transport and the timing of emplacement. Boulder size and channel hydraulic geometry were used to constrain paleo-flood discharge assuming turbulent, Newtonian fluid flow conditions, and boulder exposure ages were determined using cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating. Modeled discharges required for boulder transport of ca. 10(3) to 10(5) m(3) s(-1) exceed typical monsoonal floods in these river reaches. Exposure ages range between ca. 1.5 and 13.5 ka with a clustering of ages around 4.5 and 5.5 ka in both studied valleys. This later period is coeval with a broader weakening of the Indian summer monsoon and glacial retreat after the Early Holocene Climatic Optimum (EHCO), suggesting glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) as a possible cause for boulder transport. We, therefore, propose that exceptional outburst events in the central Himalayan range could be modulated by climate and occur in the wake of transitions to drier climates leading to glacier retreat rather than during wetter periods. Furthermore, the old ages and prolonged preservation of these large boulders in or near the active channels shows that these infrequent events have long-lasting consequences on valley bottoms and channel morphology. Overall, this study sheds light on the possible coupling between large and infrequent events and bedrock incision patterns in Himalayan rivers with broader implications for landscape evolution.

Organic-rich mesic landscapes dominated the southern island until 8200 C-14 BP. Transgression of the Sea of Okhotsk onto the island began sometime after 8200 C-14 BP, resulting in the formation first of a salty (8200-5700 C-14 BP) then a brackish (5700-5200 C-14 BP) lagoon. With lowering of sea level after 5200 C-14 BP, a freshwater lake formed, which has remained to the present day. This history parallels regional trends in the Russian Far East, where maximum sea levels occurred between 8000 and 4600 C-14 BP, peaking at 6400 C-14 BP. Sandy levels within the lake core suggest four intervals of aeolian activity (4900-4800 C-14 BP; 4300-3800 C-14 BP; 3200-3000 C-14 BP; 1900-900 C-14 BP), perhaps related to drier than present climates. Palynological data indicate a dominance of Pinus pumila-Duschekia kamtschatica shrub tundra in the lowlands 8200-5800 C-14 BP, marking the Holocene thermal maximum. This vegetation contrasts to modern, which established 5800 C-14 BP and is a mix of coastal meadow, Betula-Salix low shrub tundra, and scattered Pinus and Duschekia thickets. The palynological record shows little response to mid-to-late Holocene climatic fluctuations except for a decrease in Pinus shrubs perhaps caused by changes in snow cover and/or summer temperature during the Little Ice Age.

The 320 cm core sequence (Co1215) covers the last 17 ka calBP and reveals significant change in climate and environmental conditions on a local and regional scale. The sediment record suggests typical stadial conditions from 17.1 to 15.7 ka calBP, documented through low lake productivity, well-mixed conditions, and cold-resistant steppe catchment vegetation. Warming is indicated from 15.7 ka calBP with slightly increased in-lake productivity, gradual expansion of trees, and decreasing erosion through disappearance of local ice caps. Between 14.5 and 11.5 ka calBP relatively stable hydrological conditions are documented. The maximum in tree taxa percentages during the Bolling/Allerod interstadial (14.5-13.2 ka calBP) indicates increased temperatures and moisture availability, whereas the increase of cold-resistant open steppe vegetation taxa percentages during the Younger Dryas (13.2-11.5 ka calBP) is coupled with distinct colder and drier conditions. The Holocene sequence from 11.5 ka calBP indicates ice-free winters, stratification of the water column, a relatively high lake trophic level and dense vegetation cover over the catchment. A strong climate related impact on the limnology and physical parameters in Lake Prespa is documented around 8.2 ka through a significant decrease in productivity, enhanced mixing, strong decomposition and soil erosion, and a coeval expansion of herbs implying cool and dry climate conditions. Intensive human activity in the catchment is indicated from around 1.9 ka calBP. This multiproxy approach improves our understanding of short- and long-term climate fluctuations in this area and their impact on catchment dynamics, limnology, hydrology, and vegetation.

J	Lemay, M; Bégin, Y				Lemay, Mickael; Begin, Yves			Hydroclimatic analysis of an ice-scar tree-ring chronology of a high-boreal lake in Northern Quebec, Canada	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Ice-scars were investigated to reconstruct the ice-flood history of Corvette Lake in Northern Quebec in an attempt to determine the hydrological threshold of shore ice and identify the accompanying climatic conditions. The ice-scar record started around 1850 and showed a rapid increase in frequency at the start of the 1930s, while trees damaged by the ice were already mature and established over several decades. The study supports the hypothesis that this shift could correspond to an increase in flood discharge. Hydrological analysis of every event that occurred since 1961, the year during which instrumental recording began, indicated that scar frequency and scar maximum height were strongly correlated with average recession discharge, average flood discharge, peak discharge and flood onset. Ice-scars provided a discontinuous record of discrete events triggered by hydrologic extremes that were used to document the instrumental record using logistic regression. Results from multiple regressions suggested that ice-scars correspond to years with highs in total precipitation from January to March and from May to June, in the sum of degree-days of frost in April, and in the sum of degree-days of heat from October to April. Although imperfect for reconstructing past events, this study exemplifies the potential use of ice-scars for extending the historical record of ice-floods with hydroclimatic significance.																			0029-1277	2224-7955				DEC	2008	39	5-6					451	464		10.2166/nh.2008.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2008.003													WOS:000261689300008

An overall shallowing of the lake is reflected in the lower part of the cores, where pollen indicates a transition from glacial steppe vegetation to interstadial shrub-tundra. These beds are capped by a well-defined layer of compact clay deposited in relatively deep water, where pollen shows surrounding spruce forests and warmer- than-present summer temperatures. The most conservative interpretation is that this unit represents the last interglacial period. However, a series of Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates suggests that it corresponds with the Early Weichselian Odderade interstadial (MIS 5a). This would imply that the Odderade interstadial was just as warm as a normal interglacial in this continental part of northern Europe. If correct, then pollen analysis, as a correlation tool, is less straightforward and the definition of an interglacial is more complex than previously thought. We discuss the validity and possible systematic errors of the OSL dates on which this age model is based, but conclude they really indicate a MIS 5a age for the warm period. Above the clay is an unconformity, most likely rejecting a period of subaerial exposure implying dry conditions. Deposition of silt under fluctuating cold climates in the Middle Weichselian continued until a second gap in the record at c. 40 kyr BP. The lake basin started to fill up again around 18 kyr BP.					; Murray, Andrew/A-4388-2012; paus, aage/AAJ-8096-2020	Murray, Andrew/0000-0001-5559-1862; Henriksen, Mona/0000-0001-5004-2012													0300-9483	1502-3885					2008	37	1					20	37		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2007.00007.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2007.00007.x													WOS:000252393000002

Symptoms of eutrophication include periods of hypoxia and anoxia in bottom waters, death of benthic-dwelling organisms during anoxia, long-term reductions in the depth distribution of macrophyte communities, changes in the species composition of macrophyte communities, and increases in reports of harmful algal blooms. In 1987 the Action Plan on the Aquatic Environment was adopted to combat nutrient pollution of the aquatic environment with the overall goal of reducing nitrogen loads by 50% and point source phosphorus loads by 80%. The Danish Aquatic Nationwide Monitoring Program was begun in 1988 in order to describe the status of point sources (industry, sewage treatment plants, stormwater outfalls, scattered dwellings, and fish farms), ground water, springs, agricultural watersheds, streams, lakes, atmospheric deposition, and the marine environment. Another important aspect of the program was to document the effects on the aquatic environment of the measures and investments taken for nutrient reduction as outlined in the Action Plan. The monitoring program should determine if reductions in nutrients are achieved by the measures taken and should help decision makers choose appropriate additional measures to fulfill the objectives. Coordination with international programs and commissions is an important component of the monitoring program to meet internationally agreed upon reductions in nutrient inputs. The future and direction of the Danish National Aquatic Monitoring and Assessment Program will be to a large extent shaped by both the Water Framework Directive and Habitat Directive adopted by the European Union.

Phosphorus had the highest positive impact on phytoplankton, and higher temperatures also enhanced the biomass. Water colour, and to a lesser extent intense zooplankton grazing, restricted phytoplankton biomass. Grazers generally seemed to be ineffective at controlling phytoplankton, however, which could be partly due to the high abundance of Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae), a large motile algae not readily grazed by zooplankton. The importance of water colour, a significant factor in dystrophic lakes, emerged clearer in SEM than from regression models. SEM proved to be an effective and informative technique for exploring the factors affecting phytoplankton development, the role of each variable, and their interactions. Incorporating Bayesian analysis into the traditional SEM enabled a more detailed examination of variation in the variable estimates and possible sources of uncertainty and provided more reliable error estimates. We used total chlorophyll a as a proxy for total phytoplankton biomass, but the results clearly indicated that some of the emerging questions could have been better addressed by separating different phytoplankton groups. Nevertheless, SEM provided new insights from standard data, and we encourage its further applications in aquatic science.

The highest level of Lake Lisan is reported in the literature at 130 m below mean sea level (b.s.l.). From 70-45 calibrated ka BP, the Lisan Formation is characterised by a high gypsum/aragonite ratio and a low lithogenic content, implying a regression of an initially high water level caused by reduced water input. In the following interval (ca, 45-36 cal. ka BP), two low water stands are marked by higher salt concentrations. After recovery and a period of higher water level, the Lake Lisan era ends with a strong regression at around 16 cal. ka BP. This date coincides with the period when Lake Van. Eastern Turkey also fell dry, thus marking a strong drought signal in the entire Near East. The overlying Damya Formation, containing more lithogenics records lake level fluctuations at around 300m b.s.l. The existence of a north-south precipitation gradient. as present today, is indicated by increasing Sr/Ca ratios in aragonite and a decreasing lithogenic content in a N-S direction. Secondary gypsum formed diagenetically, and aragonite and low Mg-calcite was transformed into high Mg/Fe-calcite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

A review from its beginnings to the present	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												Water is a prime element both for sustaining life on Earth and for complex human activity. In 2015 in Romania the average electricity production was of 7343 MW h and the average consumption was of 6590 MW h. The average hydropower generated was of 1894 MW h, which is equal to 26% of the total production. In this paper, we aim at reviewing the hydropower system in Romania from its beginnings, in 1884, to its present development. The first hydropower plant in Romania was in Sinaia and had an installed capacity of 4x250 kW. Now, Romania has more than 200 HPPs, with a total installed capacity of 6.443 MW. In Romania, hydropower is the first main source of energy among RES, followed by wind energy. Between 1950 and 1990 were built 115 hydropower stations. This period is characterized by the construction of most of the hydroelectric power plants in Romania, including the largest. The development of the hydro potential has begun in Bistrfta basin. After 1990, in the transition period, after the fall of communism, the number of installed hydropower plants decreased, by 2010 totaling an installed capacity of only 838 MW, which means less than 14% of what was done before 1990. About 54% of Romania's hydropower potential is now arranged, and there are plans to reach 63.5% by 2025. The largest artificial lake of Romania is Lake Iron Gates I (Portile de Fier I), constructed between 1964 and 1972 behind a 60 m' dam. Iron Gate I rank position 52 out of 66, in the list of largest hydroelectric power stations in the world. Iron Gates I system is one of the largest hydro constructions in Europe and the largest on the Danube.					; Dragomir, George/LZE-7235-2025; NASTASE, Gabriel/G-1930-2017; Brezeanu, Alin Ionut/GRJ-8895-2022; NASTASE, Gabriel/AAP-9108-2020	Brezeanu, Alin Ionut/0000-0003-3905-4594; NASTASE, Gabriel/0000-0003-4843-0619; 													1364-0321	1879-0690				DEC	2017	80						297	312		10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.209													WOS:000412787600023

Badanital (30 degrees 2950N, 78 degrees 5526E, 2083 m a.s.l.) is a small lake located in the upper catchment area of the Ganges in Garhwal Himalaya, northern India. The lake and the regional broad-leaved semi-evergreen forests are under the influence of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and westerly associated cyclones. Palynological investigation of the BT core revealed past vegetation changes reflecting both climate and human impact during the last 4600 years. Maximum spread of oaks occurred during c. AD 550-1100 and c. AD 1400-1630, that is, the intervals which partly overlap with the Medieval Warm Period' and the Little Ice Age', respectively. Three intervals of decreased oak pollen percentages are attributed to (1) continuously drier and cooler climatic conditions and fire activity (c. 2600-500 BC), (2) severe reduction in oak forests followed by secondary succession of alder woods (c. AD 1150-1270) and (3) pre-modern settlement activities since the British imperial occupation (after c. AD 1700). We argue that the high percentages (i.e. up to 28%) of Humulus/Cannabis type and Cannabis type pollen point to intense local retting of hemp c. 500 BC-AD 1050. Based on our age model, Cannabis fibre production at Badanital is contemporaneous with archaeological records of ancient hemp products from different parts of Eurasia suggesting possible linkages to early trade and knowledge exchange routes connecting India and the Himalaya with Central and East Asia and possibly Europe.					; Long, Tengwen/AAA-7299-2022; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020	Long, Tengwen/0000-0002-8960-3179; /0000-0002-7219-5009													0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2016	26	10					1661	1675		10.1177/0959683616650267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616650267													WOS:000382971700012

Identification of coherent links between interannual sedimentary structures and daily meteorological observations in Arctic proglacial lacustrine varves: potentials and limitations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Proglacial lacustrine sediments from High Arctic Lake R (76 degrees 17.9'N, 90 degrees 59.3'W, unofficial name) are shown to be annually laminated (varved) and contain a variety of subannual structures. The formation of the subannual structures (and overall varve) was controlled by a combination of meteorologic (temperature and rainfall) and geomorphic factors. Using a training set of the ten thickest varves in the 38-year sedimentary record, a heuristic model was developed to link subannual structures with regional meteorological conditions. Within the training set, significant correlations were shown between subannual structure thickness and the magnitude of the corresponding melt event, defined as a period of continuously positive temperature. However, these correlations deteriorated as the varves progressively thinned, and several varves exhibited no relationship between their subannual structures and respective meteorological conditions. Grain size analyses showed that the thin varves were significantly finer than the thick varves and are inferred to reflect changed sediment inflow patterns that altered deposition and reduced the fidelity of the model. Despite these complexities, this study identified the potential to produce long-term, subannual reconstructions of weather conditions. Model results revealed the limitations of simple varve-meteorology relationships, as well as identified necessary environmental and sampling conditions required to produce a more robust model for future applications.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	2008	45	1					1	13		10.1139/E07-070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E07-070													WOS:000253772700001

About 182 taxa were found but samples generally have a low richness, with the majority of sites dominated by benthic genera such as Fragilaria, Navicula, and Achnanthes. Centric Cyclotella species occur at only three sites. Modern relationships between diatom abundance and water chemistry and other environmental variables were explored numerically and a preliminary transfer function for pH was developed. Lakes fell into three groups on the basis of their diatom assemblages: (1) high pH, high cation, high conductivity sites characterised by Amphora libyca, (2) shallow sites with relatively high nutrient values characterised by Fragilaria species, and ( 3) more acid and dilute sites with high amounts of snow cover in the catchments characterised by small Achnanthes species and Navicula digitulus. Five sediment cores representing the recent past were also analysed for diatoms. Three shallow sites were dominated by Fragilaria species throughout the period represented by the cores and no shifts in inferred pH were found. At two deeper sites (Arresjoen, Birgervatnet) major assemblage shifts are found which are unrelated to independent evidence for atmospheric contamination. Early (ca. 1200 AD) changes found at both sites are possibly related to the onset of the 'Little Ice Age'. Later changes are neither synchronous nor similar in nature and might be best explained as individual responses to the recovery from the 'Little Ice Age' and subsequent climatic warming.

J	Tian, JA; Nelson, DM; Hu, FS				Tian, Jian; Nelson, David M.; Hu, Feng Sheng			How well do sediment indicators record past climate? An evaluation using annually laminated sediments	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The reliability of paleoclimatic inferences from lake-sediment records rests on the understanding of how various sediment indicators respond to environmental changes. Despite the recent proliferation of paleoclimatic records, only a limited number of studies have rigorously evaluated potential indicators by comparing lake-sediment records with instrumental weather data. We analyzed annually laminated sediments of the past 100 years from a lake in north-central Minnesota for a suite of variables commonly used for climatic reconstructions. Results were compared with time series of climatic or climate-derived variables, as well as with indices of climate modes thought to influence the regional climate of the midwestern United States. The oxygen-isotopic composition of calcite (delta O-18(c)) shows trends similar to those of effective moisture (as measured by precipitation [P] minus actual evapotranspiration [AET], P-AET, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI]), with high delta O-18(c) values generally corresponding to low P-AET and low PDSI. delta O-18(c) also exhibits striking correspondence with the index of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) but it lags behind PDO by 3 years. Elevated delta O-18(c) values during the warm PDO phase probably reflect warm and dry climatic conditions in the midwestern US, especially during winter months. The carbon-isotopic composition of calcite (delta C-13(c)) shows some similarity with delta O-18(c) but also displays stratigraphic patterns resembling those of lake-productivity indicators, including biogenic silica, inverse of inorganic carbon, ratio of organic carbon to nitrogen, and to a lesser extent, organic carbon. delta C-13(c) is correlated with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and the index of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), probably because elevated MAAT stimulates the rate of algal carbon uptake, lengthens growing season, and/or enhances CO2 degassing. Varves are typically thicker during periods of lower delta O-18(c) and higher P-AET (or PDSI) values, because wet climatic conditions probably increase nutrient availability and lake productivity. Gray-scale intensity does not co-vary with any of the above climatic variables or climate-mode indices. These results demonstrate the utility of lake-sediment analyses for reconstructing temperature, drought, and large-scale climatic modes at Steel Lake. However, application to down-core reconstructions may be compromised by a number of factors, including the site specificity and non-stationarity of such relationships.

J	Garcia, AR; de Iorio, AF				Garcia, AR; de Iorio, AF			Phosphorus distribution in sediments of Morales Stream (tributary of the Matanza-Riachuelo River, Argentina). The influence of organic point source contamination	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Increased discharges of organic matter from different sources in Morales Stream, one of the main tributaries of the Matanza-Riachuelo River, caused not only an increase in its primary production but also drastic changes in the composition of its sediments, thus favoring eutrophication processes. An in situ study was carried out in order to assess the effects of an organic point source contamination ( from intensive cattle rearing) on the sediments of Morales Stream. Surface water and sediment samples were analysed to determine the chemical characteristics of the water - sediment system. The amounts and forms of sediment phosphorus were determined using the 'EDTA method' (Golterman, 1996) at two sites of the stream having different nutrient loads. The increase in the organic load of Morales Stream waters influences the dynamics of sediment P, producing two main effects: ( 1) an increase in the organic matter amount of the sediment that leads to an increase in the amount of P associated to organic fractions, which may be released by bacterial activity under anoxic conditions; and ( 2) a decrease in the concentration of P in the fraction bound to iron. Morales Stream sediments may act as a potential source of P, which can release this nutrient to water under the reducing conditions originated by uncontrolled discharges of organic residues to this water body.

M. ichthyoblabe starts its growth in late spring. In 1999, it formed a spectacular bloom during May-June, invading the lake with a maximal biomass of 298 mg(FW).L-1. This proliferation coincided with high temperatures, strong luminous intensity, alkaline pH and low to undetectable contents of nitrates and orthophosphates. The toxicity of the M. ichthyoblabe bloom material was first determined by mouse bioassay. Bloom material collected during the maximal development phase has an LD50 about 502 mg(DW).Kg(-1). Hepatotoxicity was confirmed by histopathological study. The total contents of microcystins determined by ELISA technique both for bloom material and the isolated strain are about 0.79 and 5.4 mug.g(DW)(-1) respectively. Analysis by HPLC-PDA allows the detection of I I variants of microcystins. The use of the microcystin-LR authentic sample showed the absence of this microcystin variant in the samples analysed.

The interpretation of indicator taxa yielded various vertical shifts of the vegetation belts. These palaeovegetation results have been checked with lake surface pollen spectra from 8 takes representing different altitudinal vegetation belts. Our main findings are the following: A short period of the late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (around similar to 46,000 yr ago) was characterized by interglacial temperature conditions with a tree line above its present-day altitude. During the LGM, the vicinity of the lake was not covered by ice but by sparse alpine vegetation and alpine deserts, indicating that the climate was colder by similar to 4-7 degrees C than today Markedly higher temperatures were inferred from higher arboreal pollen frequencies between similar to 13,000 and similar to 7000 yr ago with a Holocene temperature optimum and a maximal Picea-Betula mixed-forest expansion between similar to 9000 and similar to 7000 yr ago, when temperatures exceeded the present-day conditions by at least 1-2 degrees C. Alpine steppes and meadows and sub-alpine shrub vegetation dominated around the lake since the middle Holocene, suggesting that vegetation and climate conditions were exceptionally stable in comparison to previous periods.

J	Pace, ML; Findlay, SEG; Fischer, D				Pace, ML; Findlay, SEG; Fischer, D			Effects of an invasive bivalve on the zooplankton community of the Hudson River	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Previous studies documented that zebra mussels became abundant in the Hudson River during 1992 causing an 80-90% reduction in phytoplankton biomass. This study used intervention time series analysis of abundance, biomass and reproduction over the period 1987-95 to assess changes in zooplankton in response to the invasion. 2. Zebra mussels caused a size-dependent decline in zooplankton. Microzooplankton, including tintinnid ciliates, rotifers and copepod nauplii all declined in 1992 and were scarce thereafter. Mean abundances of post-naupliar copepods and of cladocerans were also lower following the invasion but these changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Egg ratios and dutch sizes for the dominant cladoceran, Bosmina freyi, were not significantly related to zebra mussels, even though relatively low egg ratios were observed after the invasion. 3. The strong declines in microzooplankton were probably caused by direct zebra mussel predation. Estimated consumption rates by mussels were roughly equivalent to maximum microzooplankton growth rates. 4. The total biomass of zooplankton in the Hudson River declined by more than 70% following the invasion. Annual average zooplankton biomass was correlated with chlorophyll, but biomass per unit chlorophyll in the Hudson River was much lower than in lakes. The present study hypothesizes that this lower biomass reflects limitations by riverine flow and by predation during summer.

Determination of 222Rn in water by absorption in polydimethylsiloxane mixed with activated carbon and gamma-ray spectrometry: An example application in the radon budget of Paterno submerged sinkhole (Central Italy)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Passive gas accumulators made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixed with activated C (AC) were studied to measure their efficiency for sampling Rn in water. In this composite the water-impermeable properties of PDMS act synergistically with adsorptive properties of AC, even when the accumulators are immersed in water for many days. A series of tests where cylindrical shaped PDMS-AC disks were exposed to different Rn-222-enriched waters showed that measured Rn-222 specific activity matches the theoretical results coming from the equation that describes the process of internal diffusion integrated with the Rn decay term. The linear relationship between Rn-222 in water and the accumulation process in PDMS-AC, the influence of temperature and the different sensitivity of the composite and its components were also studied and discussed. The high Rn volumetric enrichment factor in PDMS-AC disks respect to water resulted in about 206: 1, so lowering detection limits for Rn-222 in water to 20 Bq m(-3) when the total activity of Rn progeny in disks is measured by high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. The use of PDMS-AC accumulators was tested at the Paterno submerged sinkhole, in central Italy. This study allowed the production of a detailed synchronous vertical profile of the Rn content in the middle of the lake and to define the Rn balance by assessing the discharge rate of submerged springs and the average residence time of the lake water.

They are from five lakes in mid-southern and western Norway and one in central Sweden. When comparing the chironomid-inferred July air temperatures, there are many time segments with a poor among-lake fit in inferred temperatures. Possible environmental variables influencing the fossil chironomid assemblages are discussed using a modern Norwegian calibration data set to indicate taxon-environment relationships. These analyses indicate that local changes in pH, water chemistry, and productivity at times may have overridden the regional temperature signal. In addition, other causes of poor among-site temperature fit are discussed, in particular those related to chronological uncertainties. Holocene temperature inferences from single cores based on chironomids may not always be able to provide a reliable regional temperature signal, but can act as a guide from which hypotheses about past environmental conditions can be tested with the aid of chironomid-inferred temperatures from several sites and from other environmental proxies. We have obtained a regional picture of Holocene summer temperature change by developing a consensus reconstruction based on the overall temperature signal from all six sites. This consensus is developed by fitting a smoother through all 330 site-specific temperature-deviations from the Holocene mean. The consensus temperature deviations vary from -0.8 degrees C at 8800 cal years BP to +0.8 degrees C at 6500 cal years BP. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

F.; Devlin, S.; Hawes, I			The magnitude and climate sensitivity of isotopic fractionation from ablation of Antarctic Dry Valley lakes	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												There has been extensive research on the effects of evaporation on the isotopic ratio of lacustrine and marine water bodies; however, there are limited data on how ablation or sublimation from lake or sea ice influences the isotopic ratio of the residual water body. This is a challenging problem because there remains uncertainty on the magnitude of fractionation during sublimation and because ablation can involve mixed-phase processes associated with simultaneous sublimation, melting, evaporation, and refreezing. This uncertainty limits the ability to draw quantitative inferences on changing hydrological budgets from stable isotope records in arctic, Antarctic, and alpine lakes. Here, we use in situ measurements of the isotopic ratio of water vapor along with the gradient diffusion method to constrain the isotopic ratio of the ablating ice from two lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. We find that during austral summer, the isotopic fractionation of ablation was insignificant during periods of boundary layer instability that are typical during midday when latent heat is highest. This implies that the loss of mass during these periods did not yield any isotopic enrichment to the residual lake mass. However, fractionation increased after midday when the boundary layer stabilized and the latent heat flux was small. This diurnal pattern was mirrored on synoptic timescales, when following warm and stable conditions latent heat flux was low and dominated by higher fractionation for a few days. We hypothesize that the shifting from negligible to large isotopic fractionation reflects the development and subsequent exhaustion of liquid water on the surface. The results illustrate the complex and nonlinear controls on isotopic fractionation from icy lakes, which implies that the isotopic enrichment from ablation could vary significantly over timescales relevant for changing lake volumes. Future work using water isotope fluxes for longer periods of time and over additional perennial and seasonal ice-covered lake systems is critical for developing models of the isotopic mass balance of arctic and Antarctic lake systems.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Bellagamba, Anthony/0000-0003-4546-0185; Winslow, Luke/0000-0002-8602-5510													1523-0430	1938-4246				JAN 2	2021	53	1					352	371		10.1080/15230430.2021.2001899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2021.2001899													WOS:000732460900001
J	Mudaly, L; van der Laan, M				Mudaly, Leushantha; van der Laan, Michael			Interactions between Irrigated Agriculture and Surface Water Quality with a Focus on Phosphate and Nitrate in the Middle Olifants Catchment, South Africa	SUSTAINABILITY												Little is understood on the interaction between irrigated agriculture and surface water quality in South African catchments. A case study was conducted on the Middle Olifants Catchment, which contains the second largest irrigation scheme in South Africa. Dams, rivers, irrigation canals, and drainage canals were sampled between the Loskop and Flag Boshielo Dams. Results were compared to historical water quality monitoring data from the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). While DWS data indicate that phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) does not pose a eutrophication risk, our monitored data were above the eutrophication threshold for the majority of the sampling period. In general, phosphorus (P) pollution is a bigger issue than nitrogen (N), and concentrations of these nutrients tend to be higher during the summer rainfall months, potentially indicating a link to agriculture and fertilization events. We estimated that waste water treatment works (WWTW), which are currently systematically failing in South Africa, have the potential to pollute as much P as irrigated agriculture. Electrical conductivity levels increased downstream, moving from the acceptable towards the tolerable category, while the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) presents a moderate risk of infiltrability problems. The pH values were generally in the ideal range. This study has highlighted existing and looming water quality issues for irrigation and the environment in the Middle Olifants. Similar scoping studies are recommended for other intensively-irrigated catchments in the region to identify issues and allow timely intervention.					; van der Laan, Michael/AGG-0749-2022	Mudaly, Leushantha/0000-0003-2561-2890; van der Laan, Michael/0000-0001-8656-623X														2071-1050				JUN	2020	12	11							4370	10.3390/su12114370	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12114370													WOS:000543391800033
J	Gao, ZY; Niu, FJ; Lin, ZJ				Gao, Zeyong; Niu, Fujun; Lin, Zhanju			Effects of permafrost degradation on thermokarst lake hydrochemistry in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Thermokarst lakes play a key role in the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of permafrost regions. Current knowledge regarding the changes caused by permafrost degradation to the hydrochemistry of lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is limited. To address this gap, a systematic investigation of thermokarst lake water, suprapermafrost water, ground ice, and precipitation was conducted in the hinterland of the QTP. The thermokarst lake water in the QTP was identified to be of the Na-HCO3-Cl type. The mean concentrations of HCO3- and Na+ were 281.8 mg L-1 (146.0-546.2 mg L-1) and 73.3 mg L-1 (9.2-345.8 mg L-1), respectively. The concentrations of Li+, NH4+, K+, F-, NO2-, and NO3- were relatively low. Freeze-out fractionation concentrated the dissolved solids within the lake water during winter, which was deeply deepened on lake depth and lake ice thickness. Owing to solute enrichment, the ground ice was characterized by high salinity. Conversely, repeated replenishment via precipitation led to lower solute concentrations in the ground ice near the permafrost table compared to that within the permafrost. Although lower solute concentration existed in precipitation, the soil leaching and saline ground ice melting processes enhanced the solute load in suprapermafrost water, which is considered an important water and solute resource in thermokarst lakes. The influencing mechanism of permafrost degradation on thermokarst lake hydrochemistry is presumably linked to: (1) the liberation of soluble materials sequestered in ground ice; (2) the increase of solutes in suprapermafrost water and soil pore water; and (3) the changes in lake morphometry. These results have major implications on the understanding of the effects of ground ice melting on ecosystem functions, biogeochemical processes, and energy balance in a rapidly changing climate.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				DEC	2020	34	26					5659	5673		10.1002/hyp.13987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13987		NOV 2020											WOS:000594063200001

Massive avalanches numbering in the hundreds impacted the two main drainages in Hinsdale County. These were avalanches of historic proportions that shaved the forests and soil down to bedrock, resulting in massive amounts of debris being deposited in county waterways, leading to potential of flooding and debris flow within the town of Lake City. Governor Polis issued emergency declarations due to severe weather, including one on May 6, 2019, for Hinsdale County avalanche debris and flood risk mitigation and preparedness efforts. Henson Creek posed the primary risk for flooding of Lake City. Two historic concrete dams related to mining activity in the 1880s and early 1900s occur along Henson Creek. These are the Ute-Ulay and Hidden Treasure Dams. Analysis of the dams and the potential impacts from debris led to the partial removal of the Hidden Treasure Dam. In addition, concern about debris-flow flooding potentially impacting Lake City led to an initial evaluation of locations for debris-flow barriers. Ultimately, the natural draining characteristics of the debris/ice mix led to a "no-action" decision for debris-flow barriers.																					978-0-7844-8326-8				2021	13						110	132																WOS:000692150400009

Generally, a significant decreasing trend of annual ETr is found in the catchment. The decrease of annual ETr in the Poyang Lake basin is mostly affected by the decline of summer ETr. Over the study period, climatic variables, i.e. sunshine duration (SD), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS) and vapour pressure all showed decreasing trends, whereas mean daily temperature (DT) increased significantly. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that SD is the most sensitive climatic variable to the variability of ETr on annual basis, followed by RH, WS and DT, whereas the effect of vapour pressure is obscure. Although recent warming trend and decrease of relative humidity over the catchment could have increased ETr, the combined effect of shortened SD and reduced WS negated the effect and caused significant decrease of ETr. Our investigation reveals that the relative contributions of climatic variables to ETr are temporally unstable and vary considerably with large fluctuation. In consideration of the changes of climatic variables over time, further analysis indicated that changes of mean annual ETr in 1970-2008 were primarily affected by SD followed by WS, RH and DT with reference to 1960s. However, WS became the predominant factor during the period 2000-2008 compared with reference period 1960s, and followed by SD. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The willingness to pay (WTP) of residents for wetland restoration was expected to exhibit spatial disparities that were used for decision making. In this study, correlation analysis, binary logistic regression, and linear regression were used to assess 400 questionnaires collected through a contingent valuation survey. Results indicated that WTP amounts and the probability of positive WTP decrease as the distance from the wetlands increases. Knowledge of WRPs was the only factor that influences whether the respondents pay in the close distance (<3 km) and medium distance districts (>3 and <10 km), whereas in the remote distance district (>10 km), gender and income also affected WTP decision aside from the knowledge of WRPs. In terms of WTP amounts, income was the determining factor in the three districts, whereas age was a factor in the medium distance area. Results also showed that the growth rate of the water price should vary according to the distance of the area from the location of the WRPs. The water price was recommended to be increased by US$ 0.522/ ton, 0.520/ ton, and 0.509/ ton in the close, medium, and remote distance districts, respectively.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2015	187	8							492	10.1007/s10661-015-4654-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4654-8								26154859					WOS:000358782300011

Here we review the data on Picea pollen in sub-recent spectra, the present-day distribution of Picea obovata, and sedimentary records from a number of sites to arrive at a coherent picture of evolution of regional vegetation since the late glacial. The expansion of Siberian spruce along with steppe vegetation dates back to the undivided Bolling-Allerod interval, when this species became dominant in arboreal vegetation. Steppe landscapes persisted in a large part of the Lake Baikal watershed prior to 9.2-9 ka when the expansion of arboreal vegetation took place. Following the Younger Dryas (which seems to have had little effect on regional vegetation and peat accumulation), the role of Siberian spruce steadily declined until 8.6-6.8 ka. In the late Holocene, the abundance of P. obovata rarely exceeded the present-day ratio of ca 2% total arboreal pollen. Departures towards higher Picea abundance and higher steppe-forest index at ca 6-5 and 3-2.5 ka in Selenga Delta area appear to reflect periods with decreased temperatures and higher moisture availability in the southern part of the Lake Baikal watershed.

All three models were calibrated for a three-year period and validated for a separate two-year period. The model simulations generally showed good agreement with observed data for water column temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations. To represent a possible future climate at the end of this century, mean annual changes in air temperature by 2100, derived from the IPCC A2 scenario downscaled for these lake regions, were added to the daily baseline temperatures for years 2002-2007. Lake model simulations using this future climate scenario indicate differential increases in eutrophication in all three lakes, especially during summer months. The predicted effects on annual mean surface water concentrations of TP. TN and Chl a will be equivalent to the effects of increasing external TN and TP loading by 25-50%. Simulations for the polymictic, eutrophic Lake Rotoehu further indicate that cyanophytes will be more abundant in the future climate, increasing by >15% in their contribution to annual mean Chl a. Therefore, future climate effects should be taken into account in the long-term planning and implementation of lake management as strategies may need to be refined and adapted to preserve or improve the present-day lake water quality.

J	Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Menges, ES; Weekley, CW				Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Menges, ES; Weekley, CW			A fire-explicit population viability analysis of Hypericum cumulicola in Florida rosemary scrub	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Land managers seeking to reestablish historical fire regimes need guidance on how to apply prescribed fire to promote the population persistence of endangered species. We explored extinction risks of Hypericum cumulicola , a fire-dependent plant endemic to the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida (U.S.A). Stochastic and deterministic matrix population models based on six censuses (1994-1999) and data from several germination and seedling survival experiments were used to compare H. cumulicola demography and extinction probabilities under different fire regimes. Environmental variation associated with site, year, and winter precipitation was included in these models. We estimated time to extinction of unburned populations of different sizes and the probabilities of extinction under no fire, different regular fire-return intervals, and alternating short and long fire-return intervals. Following an initial fire, even relatively large populations of thousands of individuals may become locally extinct within 300-400 years without additional fires. Extinction probability declined as intervals between fires decreased. Fire intervals of >50 years resulted in an appreciable extinction probability after 200 years. Cycles of highly staggered short and long fire-return intervals caused slightly higher chances of extinction than regular fire-return intervals. The simulations were sensitive to estimates of survival in the seed bank. Active management will be required to restore favorable fire regimes in areas where fire has been suppressed. To maintain biodiversity, managers should consider variable fire regimes to match the requirements of a variety of species with different life histories.

J	Bavil, SS; Zeinalzadeh, K; Hessari, B				Bavil, Sepideh Salehi; Zeinalzadeh, Kamran; Hessari, Behzad			The changes in the frequency of daily precipitation in Urmia Lake basin, Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Urmia Lake, as one of the most valuable saline ecosystems in the world, has faced a sharp drop in the water level in recent years. The trend studies of climatic parameters can be effective in identifying the responsible factors and managing this crisis. This research investigated the frequency trend of daily precipitation in the ranges of less than 5 mm, 5-10 mm, 10-15 mm, 15-20 mm, and more than 20 mm in the Urmia Lake basin. The trend was assessed using Mann-Kendall, Spearman Rho and linear regression tests on 60 stations during a period of 30 years (1981 to 2011). The results showed that in all the three tests, the frequency of daily precipitation of less than 5 mm had a significant increase at 1% level. The 5-10 mm range displayed no significant trend, while the 10-15 mm range showed a significantly decreasing trend. The frequency in the 15-20 mm and above 20 mm ranges showed an insignificant falling trend. The analysis also indicated jumps in 1996 and 1999 (almost coinciding with the sharp drop in the lake's water level). In other words, the frequency trends of daily precipitation with small amounts (as a result, high evapotranspiration loss) were increasing and with large amounts were decreasing. This can be a contributor to reduced run-off and, hence, decreased water entering the lake. The results emphasize the need for changes in the management and consumption of water resources in the basin, in order to adapt to the climatic change.

Ordinary stoichiometry of extraordinary microorganisms	GEOBIOLOGY												All life on Earth seems to be made of the same chemical elements in relatively conserved proportions (stoichiometry). Whether this stoichiometry is conserved in settings that differ radically in physicochemical conditions (extreme environments) from those commonly encountered elsewhere on the planet provides insight into possible stoichiometries for putative life beyond Earth. Here, we report measurements of elemental stoichiometry for extremophile microbes from hot springs of Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Phototrophic and chemotrophic microbes were collected in locations spanning large ranges of temperature (24 degrees C to boiling), pH (1.6-9.6), redox (0.1-7.2 mg L-1 dissolved oxygen), and nutrient concentrations (0.01-0.25 mg L-1 NO2-, 0.7-12.9 mg L-1 NO3-, 0.01-42 mg L-1 NH4+, 0.003-1.1 mg L-1 P mostly as phosphate). Despite these extreme conditions, the microbial cells sampled had a major and trace element stoichiometry within the ranges commonly encountered for microbes living in the more moderate environments of lakes and surface oceans. The cells did have somewhat high C:P and N:P ratios that are consistent with phosphorus (P) limitation. Furthermore, chemotrophs and phototrophs had similar compositions with the exception of Mo content, which was enriched in cells derived from chemotrophic sites. Thus, despite the extraordinary physicochemical and biological diversity of YNP environments, life in these settings, in a stoichiometric sense, remains much the same as we know it elsewhere.

J	Pfister, G; Sonntag, B; Posch, T				Pfister, G; Sonntag, B; Posch, T			Comparison of a direct live count and an improved quantitative protargol stain (QPS) in determining abundance and cell volumes of pelagic freshwater protozoa	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												To compare the efficiency of 2 common methods in protozooplankton ecology the protozooplankton spring community of a mesotrophic prealpine lake was investigated. A direct live count and a routinely applicable modification of a quantitative protargol stain (QPS) were evaluated with respect to their reliability in determining and quantifying pelagic freshwater ciliates and heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellates. Cell counts of most ciliate species from field samples as well as of cultures were not significantly different when estimated by the 2 methods. The QPS allowed for detailed ciliate identification even for species not determinable by the applied direct live observation. Consequently, 60% of all determined species from field samples were identified exclusively by means of the QPS. Both flagellate and ciliate cell volumes showed high and species-specific shrinkage after the QPS, thus underestimating calculations of cell volumes. After the QPS, aloricate ciliates shrank to less than 20% of their respective live volumes, whereas the armoured Coleps spetai did not shrink significantly. Thus, drawbacks in applying average conversion factors for cell volume calculations after the QPS are discussed. Total heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellate numbers counted by the QPS method were 37 % of the direct live counts. Based on these results the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 tested methods used in protozooplankton analysis are summarized.

J	Al-Aasm, IS; Clarke, JD; Fryer, BJ				Al-Aasm, IS; Clarke, JD; Fryer, BJ			Stable isotopes and heavy metal distribution in Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra mussels) from western basin of Lake Erie, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Dreissena polymorpha is an exotic freshwater bivalve species which was introduced into the Great Lakes system in the fall of 1985 through the release of ballast water from European freighters. Utilizing individual growth rings of the shells, the stable isotope distribution (delta(18)O and delta(13)C) was determined for the life history of selected samples which were collected from the western basin of Lake Erie. These bivalves deposit their shell in near equilibrium with the ambient water and thus reflect any annual variation of the system in the isotopic records held within their shells. Observed values for delta(18)O range from -6.64 to -9.46 parts per thousand with an average value of -7.69 parts per thousand PDB, while carbon values ranged from -0.80 to -4.67 parts per thousand with an average value of -1.76 parts per thousand PDB. Dreissena polymorpha shells incorporate metals into their shells during growth. Individual shell growth increments were analyzed for Pb, Fe, Mg, Mn, Cd, Cu, and V concentrations. The shells show increased uptake of certain metals during periods of isotopic enrichment which correspond with warmer water temperatures. Since metals are incorporated into the shells, the organism may be useful as a biomonitor of metal pollution within aquatic environments.

Measuring and modelling nearshore recovery of an eroded beach in Lake Michigan, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Erosion by storms and high-water levels impacts large enclosed basins; however there have been few attempts to numerically model cumulative impacts in large lakes. Antecedent morphology is a large determinant of coastal sensitivity to storms, so capturing the beach recovery is important for overall vul-nerability assessment. To study beach recovery, we apply the numerical model XBeach to simulate a per-iod of low to moderate wave energy when beach recovery typically occurs. Surveys were conducted one month apart during summer of 2020 on the west coast of Lake Michigan and used to initiate model runs and evaluate model performance. XBeach was used to propagate offshore wave conditions from a Great Lakes Coastal Forecasting System (GLCFS) node-1 km offshore into the nearshore, and results were com-pared to measurements from a nearshore pressure sensor. We tested for the optimal value of the asym-metry/skewness parameter (facua) for model-data convergence. We evaluated model skill using a Mean Square Error Skill Score (MSESS) and a decomposition. In our repeat surveys we observed slight landward migration of longshore bars and the initiation of bar welding to the shoreline but, overall, changes in bathymetry were small. We found that XBeach transforms offshore waves well and sediment transport volume was accurately predicted by the model. However, XBeach did not capture the morphologic evo-lution under low energy conditions, preventing simulation of beach recovery. Overall, higher values of facua resulted in improved skill scores and modeled nearshore morphology that was more similar to the morphology measured in our surveys.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Lillie, RA				Lillie, RA			Temporal and spatial changes in milfoil distribution and biomass associated with weevils in Fish Lake, WI	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT					Annual Meeting of the Aquatic-Plant-Management-Society	JUL 12-15, 1998	MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE	Aquat Plant Management Soc				During the course of an eight year monitoring effort, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources documented a significant decline in milfoil biomass and distribution in Fish Lake, Wisconsin. Average milfoil biomass declined by 40-50% from 374-524 g dw m(-2) during 1991-93 to 265 g dw m(-2) during both 1994 and 1995. Milfoil recovered fully in 1996-98 to 446-561 g dw m(-2). The size of the milfoil bed, as discerned from aerial photographs, shrank from a maximum coverage of 40 ha in 1991 to less than 20 ha during 1995. During the "crash" of 1994-95, milfoil plants exhibited typical signs of weevil-induced damage, including darkened, brittle, hollowed-out growing tips, and the arching and collapse of stems associated with loss of buoyancy. Monitoring of weevils and stem damage during 1995-98 showed highest densities and heaviest damage occurred near shore and subsequently fanned out into deeper water from core infestation sites each spring. The extent of milfoil stem damage was positively correlated with weevil densities (monthly sampling). However, weevil densities and stem damage were lower during 1995 (when milfoil biomass was in decline) than during 1996-98 (when milfoil biomass was fully recovered).																			0146-6623					JUL	2000	38				SI		98	104																WOS:000169415800005

Previous studies highlighted the LBC benefits from great-sized lakes to mitigate urban heat island effects at the regional scale. How cold air flows out from relatively small lakes to influence the heat transfer process within urban areas, however, remains unclear. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, the temporal development of lake breezes (LBs) was simulated in Wuhan city on hot days with weak synoptic wind. We further explored the spatial structures of a single LBC and the interactions of multiple LBCs on a typical LB day. The results indicate that LBs occurred mostly in the morning, peaked around noon, and dissipated in the afternoon. The LB occurrence periods with high probability varied significantly with the lake size, shape, location, and distribution. Specifically, large lakes with simple shapes and aggregated distribution were more likely to develop and sustain LBs. There were distinct LBC flow regimes on different lakeshores, in which the perturbed LBC mainly on leeward lakeshores increased cool air penetrability compared with the strong LBC predominantly on windward lakeshores. In addition, chain flows of LBCs formed over lake groups parallel to the prevailing synoptic wind, as the upper-level outflows from one upwind LBC were connected to the lower-level inflows from the other downwind LBC. Based on these results, we propose a conceptual framework for planning urban blue space to enhance natural ventilation, which can support urban planners to create livable built environments with lake breezes entry.

J	Zhang, QO; Crittenden, JC; Shonnard, D; Mihelcic, JR				Zhang, QO; Crittenden, JC; Shonnard, D; Mihelcic, JR			Development and evaluation of an environmental multimedia fate model CHEMGL for the Great Lakes region	CHEMOSPHERE												This paper describes the development of a multimedia compartmental model-CHEMGL-which predicts the fate and transport of chemicals in the Great Lakes region and can be used for risk assessment. CHEMGL includes 10 compartments that describe a given region: air boundary layer, free troposphere, lower stratosphere, surface water, sediment, surface soil, vadose soil, groundwater zone, plant foliage and plant root. The model assumes that the compartments are completely mixed and chemical equilibrium between the phases within each compartment is assumed (e.g., suspended solids and biota in water). The attenuation mechanisms include advection, transformation reactions, and diffusive and nondiffusive intermedia transport between compartments. Input parameters include a description of each environmental media, emission rates, and chemical-specific properties and reaction rates. The numerical model results are in good agreement with the analytical solution for an example that examines the fate of benzene. Accordingly, the mathematical and computational components of the model were verified. CHEMGL predicted the concentration of four representative chemicals (atrazine, benzo[a]pyrene, benzene and hexachlorobenzene) in all five basins: Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario. The predicted concentrations fell within one to two orders of magnitude of data reported in the literature. These results suggest that the model is appropriate for estimating the fate and exposure of chemicals for a screening level risk assessment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Baker, DB; Richards, RP				Baker, DB; Richards, RP			Phosphorus budgets and riverine phosphorus export in northwestern Ohio watersheds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus (P) budgets for large watersheds are often used to predict trends in riverine P export. To test such predictions, we calculated annual P budgets for 1975-1995 for soils of the Maumee and Sandusky watersheds of northwestern Ohio and compared them with riverine P export from these watersheds. Phosphorus inputs to the soils include fertilizers, manure, rainfall, and sludge while outputs include crop removal and nonpoint-source export via rivers. Annual P inputs decreased due to reductions in fertilizer and manure inputs. Annual outputs increased due to increasing crop yields. Net P accumulation decreased from peak values of 13.4 and 9.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) to 3.7 and 2.6 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) for the Maumee and Sandusky watersheds, respectively. Thus, P budget analysis suggests that riverine P export stu y per o, w should have increased throughout creases during more recent years. However, detailed water quality studies show that riverine export of total phosphorus (TP) has decreased by 25 to 40%. and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), by 60 to 89%, both due primarily to decreases from nonpoint sources. We suggest that these decreases are associated with farmers' adoption of practices that minimize transport of recently applied P fertilizer and of sediments via surface runoff, coupled with changes in winter weather conditions. In comparison with most Midwestern, watersheds, rivers draining these watersheds have high unit area yields of TP, low unit area yields of SRP, and high ratios of nonpoint source- to point source-derived P.																			0047-2425					JAN-FEB	2002	31	1					96	108											11837450					WOS:000173484300012

However, the electrical properties of these models are rarely known in such detail that the difference between the measured and modeled transient responses can be safely attributed to the measuring system's intrinsic response, rather than the properties of a reference model. In this article, we present and discuss the results of testing TEM systems on Lake Baikal. The measurements were taken in early spring when the lake was covered with ice. More than 1000 m deep, homogeneous and isotropic water column of the lake is a unique natural model with precisely known properties. Testing works on Lake Baikal answered the question why, when using small central loop arrays in resistive environment, an anomalously slow decrease in transient EMF (long tail) is observed at late times. As it turned out, long tails are a slowly decreasing component of the input amplifier's intrinsic response to a voltage pulse induced in the receiving loop during transmitter current turn-off. As for measurements at early times, it was shown how delay effects in turning off the transmitter current manifest themselves in the early-time loop-loop TEM data.

In spring, the fish migrates from Lake Van, which has highly alkaline and brackish water, to freshwater to spawn. During the anadromous migration of the female Lake Van fish, histochemical changes in the cell types, cellular dynamics, apoptosis, cell proliferation and antioxidant responses in the corpuscles of Stannius (CS) which are tiny endocrine glands related with calcium homeostasis were examined. When compared to the lake, calcium concentrations of ambient water and plasma increased considerably in freshwater. Freshwater dramatically increased the number of predominant type-I cells in the gland while decreased the type-II cells. A reduction in the cytoplasmic periodic acid-Schiff content of type-I cells was observed in freshwater. No cytoplasmic staining was found in cytoplasm of type-II cells in both lake and freshwater. Apoptotic cells were detected in fish sampled from both the lake and freshwater and a nonsignificant increase was observed in freshwater. The number of proliferating cells increased significantly in the freshwater, as well as antioxidant defences such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione s-transferase activities, which indicates an elevated oxidative status. The findings suggest that type-I cells are possible source of a hypocalcin hormone and type-II cells are considered to be a likely precursor of type-I cells. Apoptosis and cell proliferation are basic mechanisms of gland remodelling. In addition antioxidant mechanisms play a role during the acclimation of the gland in different environments.					; Dogan, Abdulahad/ACO-8746-2022; Aykut, Handan/KEZ-9217-2024; AKAR, Fürüzan/F-7502-2018; Dogan, Emine/KIA-8145-2024; AYKUT, Handan/KEZ-9217-2024; Kaptaner, Burak/AAG-6698-2019; dogan, abdulahad/ACO-8746-2022; Dönmez, Fatih/LIC-9076-2024	DOGAN, Emine/0000-0002-4484-5625; Aykut, Handan/0000-0002-6458-2156; Kaptaner, Burak/0000-0003-2366-6756; dogan, abdulahad/0000-0002-5438-8560; 													1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2022	53	7					2959	2969		10.1111/are.15811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.15811		FEB 2022											WOS:000761537900001
J	Orvis, KH; Horn, SP				Orvis, KH; Horn, SP			Quaternary glaciers and climate on Cerro Chirripo, Costa Rica	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Glacial lake sediments and glacial geomorphology in Valle de las Morrenas, a glacial trough on the north face of Cerro Chirripo, Costa Pica, provide evidence on high-altitude Pleistocene conditions in Central America. The most recent glacier in the valley (Chirripo stage I) receded very rapidly near the end of the Younger Dryas chronozone. Radiocarbon dates on basal organic sediments from lakes beneath upper, middle, and lower limits of that glacier fall close together, and two-sigma calibrated ages overlap for the period 9700-9600 cal yr B.P. Earliest datable transition sediments from the central lake date to 12,360-11,230 cal vr B.P. Larger, older moraines, and associated trimlines, allowed reconstruction of three paleoglaciers (Chirripo stages II, III and IV). Computer analysis of hypsometry using published tropical-glacier vertical mass balance profiles yields ELAs of 3506-3523, 3515-3537, and 3418-3509 m, respectively; Chirripo II ELA-estimate positions applied to Chirripo I yield an ELA of 3538-3546 m. We infer minimal temperature depressions of 7.4-8.0 degrees C for the Chirripo I-IV stages, Modeling the behavior of modern tropical glaciers yields basinwide net accumulation estimates of 440-620, 550-830, and 960-1760 mm yr(-1) for the Chirripo, II, III, and IV stages.

J	Wang, J; Fan, K; Xu, ZQ; Liu, SF				Wang, Juan; Fan, Ke; Xu, Zhiqing; Liu, Shaofeng			A dipole pattern of July precipitation between South China and the eastern Tibetan Plateau and impacts of ENSO	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Based on observations, reanalysis data, and numerical experiments, the present study investigates the link between the interannual variation in precipitation over South China (SC) and the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP) in July during 1979-2019 and the underlying mechanisms. Results show that during May-September the variation in precipitation exhibits a dipole pattern between the two regions in July and August only, with more significance in July. The correlation coefficients of precipitation between the two regions in July and August are - 0.60 and - 0.34, statistically significant at the 99% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. The role of developing ENSO in the formation of the precipitation dipole in July is further investigated. During El Nino's development in July, precipitation increases over the tropical central-eastern Pacific, and decreases from India to the Maritime Continent and tropical Atlantic. These conditions cause anomalous cyclones over SC and the northern Bay of Bengal, and an anomalous anticyclone over Lake Balkhash to Northwest China in the middle and lower troposphere via the tropical atmospheric bridge and upper-tropospheric wave trains over Eurasia. This favors the July precipitation dipole with increased (decreased) precipitation over SC (the ETP). In La Nina's developing phase in July, the opposite is true. Moreover, numerical experiments with the ECHAM5 model can reproduce the above physical processes.					; Xu, Zhiqing/AAJ-2198-2020; Fan, Ke/AAJ-2315-2020	Fan, Ke/0000-0002-0776-4017; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				DEC	2023	61	11-12					5785	5804		10.1007/s00382-023-06884-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-023-06884-7		JUL 2023											WOS:001031410000001

In this study, we used targeted cell sorting combined with single-cell sequencing to gain insights into the gene content and genomic potential of viruses infecting sulfur-oxidizing bacteria Chlorobium clathratiforme, obtained from water samples collected during summer stratification in gypsum karst Lake Kirkilai (Lithuania). In total, 82 viral contigs were bioinformatically identified in 62 single amplified genomes (SAGs) of C. clathratiforme. The majority of viral gene and protein sequences showed little to no similarity with phage sequences in public databases, uncovering the vast diversity of previously undescribed GSB viruses. We observed a high level of lysogenization in the C. clathratiforme population, as 87% SAGs contained intact prophages. Among the thirty identified auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), two, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) and thioredoxin-dependent phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase (cysH), were found to be involved in the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds, suggesting that viruses can influence the metabolism and cycling of this essential element. Finally, the analysis of CRISPR spacers retrieved from the consensus C. clathratiforme genome imply persistent and active virus-host interactions for several putative phages prevalent among C. clathratiforme SAGs. Overall, this study provides a glimpse into the diversity of phages associated with naturally occurring and highly abundant sulfur-oxidizing bacteria.					; Šulčius, Sigitas/HSD-5964-2023; Alzbutas, Gediminas/NJR-3791-2025; Šimoliūnienė, Monika/JVZ-6012-2024	Simoliunas, Eugenijus/0000-0001-5712-3587; Simoliuniene, Monika/0000-0002-3225-2873; Sulcius, Sigitas/0000-0002-2686-8348; Paskauskas, Ricardas/0000-0003-1531-1971; Alzbutas, Gediminas/0000-0002-5958-0543														2073-4425				JUN	2021	12	6							886	10.3390/genes12060886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes12060886								34201311					WOS:000666022800001

Late Quaternary vegetation and climate history of a perennial river canyon in the Rio Salado basin (22°S) of Northern Chile	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Plant macrofossils from 33 rodent middens sampled at three sites between 29 10 and 3150 in elevation in the main canyon of the Rio Salado, northern Chile, yield a unique record of vegetation and climate over the past 22,000 cal yr BP. Presence of low-elevation Prepuna taxa throughout the record suggests that mean annual temperature never cooled by more than 5 degrees C and may have been near-modem at 16,270 cal yr BP. Displacements in the lower limits of Andean steppe and Puna taxa indicate that mean annual rainfall was twice modem at 17,520-16,270 cal yr BP. This pluvial event coincides with infilling of palcolake Tauca on the Bolivian Altiplano, increased ENSO activity inferred from a marine core near Lima, abrupt deglaciation in southern Chile, and Heinrich Event 1. Moderate to large increases in precipitation also occurred at 11,770-9550 (Central Atacama Pluvial Event), 7330-6720, 3490-2320 and at 800 cal yr BP. Desiccation occurred at 14,180, 8910-8640, and 4865 cal yr BP. Compared to other midden sites in the region, early Holocene desiccation seems to have happened progressively earlier farther south. Emerging trends from the cumulative midden record in the central Atacama agree at millennial timescales with improved paleolake chronologies for the Bolivian Altiplano, implying common forcing through changes in equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperature gradients.

Demography, Habitat, and Movements of the Sierra Nevada Yellow-Legged Frog (Rana sierrae) in Streams	COPEIA												The Sierra Nevada Yellow-Legged Frog (Rana sierrae) has generally been viewed as a lake species, but it has increasingly been found in streams, including in the northern part of its range where it is particularly at risk. Developing effective conservation strategies has been hindered by a lack of knowledge of its basic ecological requirements in stream habitats. To address this information gap, we investigated the demography, habitat use, and movements of stream populations of this federally endangered species. We conducted capture-mark-recapture of adults, quantitatively described stream channel and riparian vegetation characteristics, and collected habitat use data at four northern Sierra Nevada mountain streams, counted egg masses at three central Sierra Nevada streams, and radio-tracked individuals at three central and southern Sierra Nevada streams. Stream populations in the northern range were very small with maximum abundances of < 15 individuals, and apparent survival probability ranged from 0.57-0.81. In contrast, one southern Sierra Nevada stream had a large count of 547 adults. Egg mass counts ranged from 22-104 per stream. We found frogs in diverse headwater streams ranging from perennial to intermittent flow regimes, pool versus riffle dominated, and low to high channel gradient, and they used diverse microhabitats within these streams. In these stream habitats, frogs moved little over four-day survey periods but were capable of moving longer distances of up to 1248 m over the summer. Conservation and management of the at-risk R. sierrae are most likely to be effective when built on comprehensive quantitative information on basic ecological requirements in all habitats used by the species.

Historical records indicate declining fish populations between 1951 and 1966, but paleolimnological work using diatoms failed to find evidence for further recent acidification of this naturally acid site. We initiated new paleolimnological studies using mallomonadacean chrysophytes to further our understanding of Cone Pond''s recent past. Our stratigrahic analyses indicate recent striking changes in the chrysophyte flora of this lake, with Mallomonas hindonii, a species only common in recently acidified lakes, replacing M. crassisquama, a cosmopolitan species that dominated the flora over the preceding 8000 yr; this recent change parallels the declines in fish populations. Becauses chrysophytes often bloom in early spring and are known, in other lakes, to experience changes in community composition before those expressed by the diatom community, a possibility is that chrysophytes track transient excursions of lake water chemistry associated with early snowmelt conditions. In this scenario, chrysophytes would respond to a constellation of specific short-term chemical changes including, but not restricted to, pH. Such pH associated changes could include changes in concentrations, speciation, or complexation of metals mobilized from the catchment or sediments, all of which are known to affect both chrysophytes and fish.

Electrical and geochemical properties of tufa deposits as related to mineral composition in the South Western Desert, Egypt	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING												The geochemical, petrographical, and electrical properties of rocks are essential to the investigation of the properties of minerals. In this paper we will try to present a study of the A. C. electrical properties of carbonate rock samples and their relation to petrographical and geochemical properties. Samples were collected from four formations from the Bir Dungul area, in the South Western Desert, Egypt. The electrical properties of the samples were measured using a non-polarizing electrode, at room temperature (similar to 28 degrees C), and at a relative atmospheric humidity of (similar to 45%), in the frequency range from 42 Hz to 5 MHz. The changes in the electrical properties were argued to the change in mineral composition. Generally, the electrical properties of rocks are changed due to many factors e.g., grain size, mineral composition, grain shape and inter-granular relations between grains. The dielectric constant of samples decreases with frequency, and increases with conductor concentration. Also, the conductivity increases with an increase of continuous conductor paths between electrodes. The petrographical and geochemical studies reveal that the deposition of the tufa deposits occurred in shallow lakes accompanied by a high water table, an alkaline spring recharge and significant vegetation cover. Diagenetically, tufa deposits were subjected to early and late diagenesis. Petrography and geochemistry studies indicated that the area of tufa deposits was deposited under the control of bacterial activity. Geochemically, the Sr content indicates that the tufa deposits formed from dissolved bicarbonate under the control of microbes and bacterial activity.					; Gomaa, Mohamed/B-5970-2013	Abou El-Anwar, Esmat/0000-0001-5947-2254; Gomaa, Mohamed/0000-0002-8556-4555													1742-2132	1742-2140				JUN	2015	12	3					292	302		10.1088/1742-2132/12/3/292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-2132/12/3/292													WOS:000355309000002
J	Turney, CSM; Hunt, JE; Burrows, C				Turney, CSM; Hunt, JE; Burrows, C			Deriving a consistent δ13C signature from tree canopy leaf material for palaeoclimatic reconstruction	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Contemporary studies of stable carbon isotope values (delta(13)C) from leaves in the canopies of mature forest indicate that reduced irradiance and respired CO2 might bias palaeoenvironmental reconstructions developed using the C-13 content of unsorted plant material formed within comparable ancient environments. Here, we investigated whether any simple morphological and/or chemical characteristics could identify the position of the leaf within a canopy of the evergreen mountain beech (Nothofagus solandrivar. cliffortiodes). Leaf mass per unit area, carbon content and delta(13)C values of both bulk and lignin components of the leaves increased exponentially from the ground up through the canopy. Nitrogen, remobilized before death, was unsuitable as an indicator of canopy position. Leaf mass per unit area on the forest floor indicated that leaves from the sunlit part comprised approximately 30% of the fallen leaves; leaves originating from the upper canopy made up the remaining litter. Application of leaf mass per unit area to a 22 000-yr-old sequence dominated by mountain beech leaves from Mount George (New Zealand), demonstrated that this signal was preserved in the fossil record. Sunlit leaf material can be successfully differentiated from that originating deeper within the palaeo-canopy, thereby allowing robust delta(13)C analyses for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.

Mercury dynamics and transport in two Adirondack lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the chemistry and fluxes of mercury (Hg) species for two Adirondack lakes with contrasting landscape, physical, and chemical attributes. Samples were collected monthly at the lake inlets and outlets over 2 yr, and evasion of elemental Hg was measured at one lake (Arbutus). Concentrations of total Hg (THg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) in watershed runoff were highly variable throughout the year, increasing markedly during summer months. The proportion of THg as MeHg ranged from < 5% at Arbutus Lake up to 10% at Sunday Lake. Concentrations of Hg species increased with increases in dissolved organic carbon concentrations and percentage wetland coverage. The estimated rate of volatilization loss of elemental mercury (Hg(o)) from Arbutus Lake surface (7.8 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) was comparable to the rate of direct atmospheric Hg deposition to the lake surface (8.6 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)). Dry deposition to Arbutus Lake amounted to ca. 26% of total wet THg deposition. Hydraulic residence time (HRT) played a critical role in controlling Hg dynamics in the lakes. Negligible removal of THg inputs was observed at Sunday Lake, which has a short HRT (0.02 yr), compared with approximately 60% removal at Arbutus Lake, which has a longer HRT (0.6 yr). This pattern of increasing net Hg retention in lakes with increasing HRT was consistent with other mass balance studies in the literature. Both Arbutus and Sunday lakes were net sinks of MeHg.					; Driscoll, Charles/F-9832-2014; Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014	Holsen, Thomas/0000-0001-9599-6733; Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890													0024-3590					MAR	2009	54	2					413	427		10.4319/lo.2009.54.2.0413	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.2.0413													WOS:000265169800002

In order to explain its success as a dominant species in Dongting Lake, the basic biological knowledge of this species was studied from July 2013 to July 2015 in the channel connecting Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River. A total of 11 064 samples of C. brachygnathus were collected, and their standard length ranged between 6.8 and 35.4 cm. The length-weight relationship was W= 0.0026 L-3.057, and von Bertalanffy growth curve was L-t = 36.41(1-e(-0.28(t+0.8))).The exploitation rate (E) of 0.49, indicated no overfishing on this species. Its movement patterns were highly significantly and positively correlated with the rate of variation in water level, discharge and water temperature. When water level (discharge and temperatures) were rising (mainly March to July), C. brachygnathus migrated into Dongting Lake, peaking in May. When the water level (discharge and temperatures) were falling (mainly October to December), the migratory behaviour changed to exiting Dongting Lake, peaking in October. The present study suggests, fast generation time, low exploitation rate and the river-lake movements (migrations) are the possible reasons that made C. brachygnathus a dominant species in this area.

Barrier-spit geomorphology and inlet dynamics in absence of tides: evolution of the North Pond system, eastern Lake Ontario, New York State	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Barrier systems have received much attention along microtidal oceanic coastlines, where countless studies discuss their evolution in response to Holocene sea-level rise, storm influence, and anthropogenic impacts. Lacustrine barrier evolution is not as well investigated and little is known about how lake-specific hydrodynamic processes shape barrier morphology. This study evaluates the evolution of a highly dynamic barrier section along eastern Lake Ontario in the context of varying water levels and winter-ice covers. Paleoshoreline reconstructions and volumetric analyses of nearshore sedimentation indicate the central portion of the studied North Pond barrier has been breached many times in different locations throughout the last century. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data corroborate mapped locations of former inlets, bound at the surface by recurved spit and dune ridges. Subsurface structural controls on inlet position are inferred from a spatial correlation with buried incised fluvial channels, formed during a Holocene lake-level lowstand. While subsurface controls caused two separate historical inlets to remain stationary while open, an episode of rapid inlet migration elsewhere along the barrier was facilitated by the prevailing direction of coastal currents and high lake levels, which favored overwash and rapid longshore sediment mobility across a low-gradient barrier section. Additionally, the sudden closing of an inlet after many decades of operation coincidental with the opening of another suggestively occurred alongside unusually high lake levels. These correlations suggest the degree of coastal inundation, predominantly a function of fluctuating lake levels and antecedent topography, represent strong controls on overall barrier geomorphology over decadal timescales.

The high diversity of Moroccan continental malacofaunas makes them a very suitable fossil group for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and palaeobiodiversity implications. The malacological study of Blirh is the first in Morocco to be based on a systematic sampling providing a complete faunal record in order to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental successions. Three biozones have been recognized. They illustrate occurrence of a marsh and a lake from shortly before 10,600 cal. BP followed by an abrupt drying up around 5000 cal. BR This dramatic environmental change is not synchronous with lithological variations as stated by previous studies based on geological and palynological records. The Blirh lacustrine phase fits into the humid period that follows full glacial hyperarid conditions during the latest Pleistocene in North Africa from 14,800 cal. BR The abrupt shift to dry conditions around 5000 cal. BP inferred from the malacological succession correlates with the contraction of Saharan lakes. During the last biozone, despite disappearance of the main water-body, marshy species persist and demonstrate occurrence of very wet environments in the Middle Moulouya plateau until historical times. Several species, currently absent from the region, were found within the Holocene assemblages. At least two new species of aquatic molluscs (Hydrobiidae) have been discovered. Sampling of modern malacofaunas from wells and springs in the area has demonstrated that one of them is still living in the water-table. The Blirh malacological record provides an insight of the palaeo-biogeographical changes affecting this group during the Holocene and demonstrates the very recent increase of human impact on the regional biodiversity.

J	Klassen, J				Klassen, J			Paleoenvironmental interpretation of the paleosols and sediments at the Stampede site (DjOn-26), Cypress Hills, Alberta	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES					GSA 2003 Annual Meeting	NOV, 2003	Seattle, WA	GSA				A 3.65 m-thick sequence of paleosols and sediments exposed at the Stampede archaeological site provides an opportunity for studying climate change and its impact on ancient site utilization over a 7200-year period. Three radiocarbon dates establish temporal boundaries for the lower sequence of paleosols and sediments at 7200 and 6100 BP. This lower sequence is characterized by lack of cultural material in most paleosols, high accumulation rates, and evidence for fluvial deposition. The upper sequence dates from 6100 BP and is characterized by low accumulation rates, increased pedogenesis, and increased evidence for human occupation, particularily between 4660 and 5230 BP. Phytoliths provide a strong signal for grassland vegetation beginning at 6100 years BP coincident with the most intensive occupation of the site. Stable carbon isotopes and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios support the presence of grass. The differences evident between the lower and upper sequences can be attributed to the change from warm dry conditions to cooler, moister conditions and agree to a first approximation with the information inferred from the nearby Elkwater Lake and Harris Lake records. However, the persistence of forest at the Stampede site for a 1400-year time interval, when the Harris Lake record indicates more arid conditions, suggests that springs and north-facing slopes made the Cypress Hills an "oasis" for both animals and people.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JUN	2004	41	6					741	753		10.1139/E04-027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E04-027													WOS:000222652400008

Analyses of different grebe tissues (egg yolk and albumen, pectoral and leg muscle, breast and primary feathers) also allowed us to assess the effectiveness of these tissues at representing grebe trophic relations. Isotopic ratios from pectoral and leg muscles were similar, based on comparisons within individual birds. Enriched values of delta(15)N and delta(13)C suggested that breast and primary feathers were molted over winter, and therefore reflected a marine food web. Albumen and yolk of grebe eggs and muscle tissues from downy chicks, however, matched isotopic characteristics of the local food web, indicating that female Red-necked Grebes use nutrients from the breeding lake for egg formation. Eggs, therefore, can provide excellent material for isotopic analysis aimed at assessing trophic relations of Red-necked Grebes on breeding lakes. Gut contents and stable isotopes both indicated that grebes from lakes with fish consumed a mixed diet of fish and macroinvertebrates and occupied the highest trophic level, at or above the level of piscivorous fishes. In contrast, grebes from lakes lacking fish occupied a lower trophic position.

These hunter -gatherer groups lived on the shores of seasonal lakes ( playas ) and wetlands typical for the Early and Middle Holocene landscape of that part of the Saharan North Africa. They manufactured characteristic lithic artifact assemblages that have not been studied, so far, from a microwear perspective. The El Ghorab Unit lithic artifact assemblages are dominated by morphologically distinct triangular microliths, ca. 30 -40 mm long and made from relatively wide blades, ca. 10 mm in width. This paper presents the results of morphological and functional analyses of El-Ghorab triangles from site E-1603 located in the Gebel Ramlah/Nabta Playa region. At this locality, remnants of a few activity areas have been recorded on the northwestern margin of the Gebel Ramlah paleo-lake basin. The site consists of lithic artifact concentrations scattered around burned -earth hearth features (fireplaces). The function of the triangles is examined and interpreted here by also taking into account the specific paleoenvironmental and paleozoological record from site E-16-03. The El-Ghorab area of the Gebel Ramlah basin at E-16-03 contains three seasonally -specific, short-term hunting camps where hunting equipment was repaired and hunted game was brought to the site during spring time. Triangles were the main goal of lithic production. In the course of this research it has become evident that triangular microliths were mounted in hafts in different ways. This observation can be used as supporting evidence to conclude that various prehistoric human groups visited the Gebel Ramlah area during several seasonal cycles.					; Osypinska, Marta/AAJ-6493-2021	Kabacinski, Jacek/0000-0002-2118-2005; 													2352-409X					JUN	2024	56								104578	10.1016/j.jasrep.2024.104578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2024.104578		MAY 2024											WOS:001240973000001
J	Nodilo, M				Nodilo, Marija			NATURAL HERITAGE OF THE ISLAND OF MLJET - THE BASIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEDICAL TOURISM	SUMARSKI LIST												The island of Mljet is well known for its natural heritage: two salt lakes, forests of Holm oak and Aleppo pine, blatina (brachish water), cliff coasts, sandy coves, caves, richness of underwater life, natural harbours, springs of drinkable water, endemic and medical plants. As a result of awareness of need to protect this amazing natural environment, forests and vegetation are preserved: The one third of the island Mljet was pronounced a national park in the year 1960 to make conditions for systematic nature protection. There are many reasons to encourage health tourism on Mljet: mild Mediterranean climate with green vegetation and possibility for hiking, recreation and sightseeing throughtout the year. Environmental pollution is non existing and for that reason as well, the conditions for rehabilitation in this natural ambience is perfect. To make a progress for inhabitants and guests with this kind of tourism, there should be also infrastructure beside these favourable natural conditions. Until now has been no official medical tourism on Mljet, although long walks and enjoying in natural beauty of Mljet have always been known for their positive impact on health. Mljet is an island so rich with natural beauty is best place there is for health tourism. It can be explored through leisure mountaineering across the hilltops, walks around the lakes, swimming in sea during summertime as well as looking at intact nature from a boat. As well as great natural heritage, one also has to mention cultural heritage: ruin of an old roman palace (4th or 5th century AD), Benedictine monastery (12th century AD) as well as monastery from the time of Republic of Dubrovnik. Above all, Mljet is one of rare places on Earth where pollution is non-existent as there is not one factory anywhere nearby. For all of these reasons, Mljet can be visited during any season of the year.																			0373-1332						2012	136	7-8					377	385																WOS:000310125700006

Our approach included (1) the phylogenetic analyses of near full-length SSU and LSU sequences of freshwater Perkinsea, (2) a meta-analysis of public Perkinsea 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequences available from the freshwater environments (25 lakes, 4 rivers), (3) microscopic observations of Perkinsea associated with planktonic communities and (4) single amplified genome analysis. Whereas Perkinsea appear to be rare in river ecosystems (85 reads), they are found in almost all of the lakes studied. However, their diversity does vary considerably between lakes (from 0 to 2 463 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Parvilucifera/Dinovorax/Snorkelia and Perkinsus/Xcellia/Gadixcellia clades resulted from an initial speciation event. This second clade is further split into well-supported, monophyletic groups, including a clade dominated by freshwater representatives, which is further structured into three distinct subclades: freshwater clade 1, freshwater clade 2 and a freshwater and brackish clade. The Perkinsea Single Amplified Genome (SAG) as well as most of the abundant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) fall into freshwater clade 2. The tyramide signal amplification-fluorescent in situ hybridization method showed an internal association between Perkinsea and the colonial phytoplankton Sphaerocystis. The Single Amplified Genome (SAG) annotation contained 698 genes and gene ontology terms could be assigned to 486 protein-coding genes. Although the number of genes appears to be low (10.6% of the entire gene set assessed by BUSCO), the analysis of the proteome revealed some putative secreted virulence factors. This study showed a large distribution of Perkinsea across lake ecosystems and potential parasitic association with phytoplankton. However, further investigations are needed for a better knowledge on the role of these microorganisms in freshwater ecosystems.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Bronner, Gisele/0000-0002-4863-4518; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN	2020	42	1					3	17		10.1093/plankt/fbz068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbz068													WOS:000518532300002
J	Saleem, M; Jeelani, G				Saleem, Mohammad; Jeelani, Ghulam			Geochemical, isotopic and hydrological mass balance approaches to constrain the lake water-groundwater interaction in Dal Lake, Kashmir Valley	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												It is important to have qualitative as well as quantitative understanding of the hydraulic exchange between lake and groundwater for effective water resource management. Dal, a famous urban fresh water lake, plays a fundamental role in social, cultural and economic dynamics of the Kashmir Valley. In this paper geochemical, isotopic and hydrological mass balance approaches are used to constrain the lake water-groundwater interaction of Dal Lake and to identify the sources of lake water. Water samples of precipitation (n = 27), lake water (n = 18) and groundwater (n = 32) were collected across the lake and its catchment for the analysis of delta O-18 and delta H-2. A total of 444 lake water samples and 440 groundwater samples (springs, tube wells and dug wells) were collected for the analysis of Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-, NO3-, Na+ and K+ . Water table and lake water level were monitored at 40 observation locations in the catchment. Water table map including pH and EC values corroborate and verify the gaining nature of the Dal Lake. Stable isotopes of lake water in Boddal and Gagribal basins showed more deviation from the global meteoric water line than Hazratbal and Nigeen basins, indicating the evaporation of lake water. The isotopic and geochemical mass balance suggested that groundwater contributes a significant proportion (23-40%) to Dal Lake. The estimated average groundwater contribution to Dal Lake ranged from 31.2 x 10(3) to 674 x 10(3) m(3) day(-1) with an average of 276 x 10(3) m(3) day(-1). The study will be useful to delineate the possible sources of nutrients and pollutants entering the lake and for the management of lake water resources for sustainable development.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												To mitigate eutrophication by enhancing water exchange in Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China, a water transfer project was initiated in 2002. The project was designed to flush pollutants out of the lake by transferring water from the Yangtze River. However, the original Yangtze River Diversion did not significantly enhance water exchange in the Meiliang Bay, the most polluted area of Lake Taihu. To overcome this deficiency, the improved Yangtze River Diversions have been designed recently by adding two new pump stations named Meiliang and Xingou around Meiliang Bay. Effectiveness of water transfer projects was investigated in this study by using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC), based on the concept of water age. Model results showed that adding new pump stations significantly improved the effectiveness of Yangtze River Diversion in Meiliang Bay. Success of water transfer is also strongly associated with the inflow or outflow rate of water transfer projects and wind conditions. Southeastern winds which dominate in summer increase performance of water transfer and improve water exchanges in Meiliang Bay. Considering water age and cost, an economically effective influent flow rate from Wangyu River (the original Yangtze River Diversion) was predicted to be 120 m(3)/s, and the corresponding appropriate outflow rate from the Meiliang pump station was about 15-20 m(3)/s on the basis of multi-objective optimization method, which decreased the average water age in Meiliang Bay by 24.32% of the original Yangtze River Diversion. Adding Xingou pump station had the similar contribution to reducing the water age in Meiliang Bay as the Meiliang pump station. In general, the improved Yangtze River Diversions played a supplementary role for the original Yangtze River Diversion in solving algal bloom problems in Meiliang Bay. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hawes, I; Andersen, DT; Pollard, WH				Hawes, I; Andersen, DT; Pollard, WH			Submerged aquatic bryophytes in Colour Lake, a naturally acidic polar lake with occasional year-round ice-cover	ARCTIC												Colour Lake is a small, naturally acidic (pH 3.7) lake on Axel Hxeiberg Island (Canadian High Arctic) that experiences occasional year-round ice cover. We investigated the benthic vegetation of this lake, with a specific aim of determining whether the annual growth of benthic bryophytes reflects the state of summer ice cover. We found the bed of the lake to be almost completely covered by mosses or liverworts to a depth of 22 m. The mosses showed annual growth bands 10-30 mm in length, visible as changes in leaf density and size. Four to five bands retained recognizable leaves and measurable amounts of chlorophyll-a (chla), and up to 12 bands were recognizable from leaf scars. We could not find a consistent relationship between band length and persistence of ice cover for a given year. We suggest that this lack is due to the complex effects of ice cover on moss growth conditions, specifically on the water temperature and irradiance at depth. Photosynthetic characteristics of Calliergon over a range of light and temperature conditions, determined using pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry, are presented in support of this argument. We conclude that moss banding patterns are an unreliable method of hindcasting episodic failure of ice to melt in Arctic lakes.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259													0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	2002	55	4					380	388																WOS:000180646300009

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Massive summer blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have been documented in the Baltic Sea since the 19th century, but are reported to have increased in frequency, biomass, and duration in recent decades-presumably in response to the well-documented anthropogenic eutrophication of the Baltic. Here, we present an 8,000-yr record of fossil cyanobacterial pigments, diatom microfossil assemblages, and delta(15)N variations in sediment cores from the Baltic proper. This record indicates that nitrogen-living cyanobacterial blooms are nearly as old as the present brackish water phase of the Baltic Sea, starting as far back as ca. 7000 B.P.-soon after the former freshwater Ancylus Lake turned into the brackish Litorina Sea. Demonstration of cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic prior to the greatly increased anthropogenic nutrient inputs of the 20th century is important for setting realistic goals when trying to reduce the magnitude of present brooms. Our results suggest that the presently predominating nitrogen (N) limitation of phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea proper is not man-induced, but a natural phenomenon, which has endured for some 7,000 yr. These cyanobacterial blooms were possibly initiated by increased availability of phosphorus (P)-from inflow of P-rich seawater and increased P release from sediments-during periods of deep-water anoxia, caused by the establishment of salinity stratification. Efforts to restore the Baltic proper to a more oligotrophic and natural condition should take into account that nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial blooms are a characteristic, natural feature of this sea.

TECHIRGHIOL LAKE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH TOURISM	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The tourism destination management of the Techirghiol area involves many processes regarding the usage of natural resources from the lake Techirghiol for therapeutic purposes and should be a major concern of the local and central public administration, upon the long-term management of the Romanian natural heritage. With one of the richest and oldest historical balneal bases in Romania, Balneal and Rehabilitation Sanatorium of Techirghiol is preoccupied with the development of the methods and means of ensuring the preservation and sustainable use of its natural heritage, such as the sapropelic mud of Techirghiol. Techirghiol Lake was declared protected area by means of Government decision (G.D.) 1266/2000, and, in 2006 also as Ramsar site (Convention on Wet Areas) by means of G.D. 1586/2006, and in 2007 Area of Special Aqui-Fauna Special Protection (SPA), thus being part of the European network of protected areas Natura 2000. One of the management projects of the specialists from the research nucleus of Balneal and Rehabilitation Sanatorium of Techirghiol involves the development of an integrated special catalog for guideline balneal treatments and touristic consultancy services both for Romanian and foreign tourists, adapted to the specific individual needs, including social tourism which is representative in this area. The Balneal and Rehabilitation Sanatorium of Techirghiol offers many spa and medical balneal treatments during the entire year, with obvious peak in middle summer, with a big development in this moment of wellness treatments using natural factors from lake resources, as a priority of the local management to improve all aspects of patient well-being.

J	Liu, HY; Tian, YH; Ding, D				Liu, HY; Tian, YH; Ding, D			Contributions of different land cover types in Otindag Sandy Land and Bashang area of Hebei Province to the material source of sand stormy weather in Beijing	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Different land cover types in Otindag Sandy Land and Bashang area of Hebei Province are linked to a material source of sand stormy weather in Beijing based on results of field vegetation and soil survey and laboratory works. Results of grain size analysis show that dust release potential in per unit area of moving sandy land is small, while lowland meadow and meadow steppe in stony hills have high potential of releasing dusts in per unit area during sand stormy weather occurrence. Further considering the effects of vegetation, it is inferred that the moving sandy land served as a material source of past dust storm and the possibility of dust release in per unit area is low in current time. Typical steppe in stony hills is undergoing desertification and its dust release possibility in per unit area is high. Farmland has strong potential of release dusts when they are ploughed in spring, but a large amount of therophytes; grow and thus prevent dusts from release when cultivation was terminated. Potentials of dust release in per unit area in fixed sand dunes, stony mountain meadow steppe and lowland meadow are low due to high cover of perennials. Sand dune reactivation and desiccation of lakes and lowlands under estimated future climatic change will make them serve as a future material source of sand stormy weather.																			1001-6538	1861-9541				SEP	2003	48	17					1853	1856		10.1360/02wd0609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/02wd0609													WOS:000185748300015
J	Muller, SR; Berg, M; Ulrich, MM; Schwarzenbach, RP				Muller, SR; Berg, M; Ulrich, MM; Schwarzenbach, RP			Atrazine and its primary metabolites in Swiss lakes: Input characteristics and long-term behavior in the water column	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In order to assess the impact of herbicides on aquatic ecosystems, detailed information on the factors that govern the input and the behavior of such chemicals in rivers, lakes, and coastal seawater is required. In this context, we studied the input characteristics (seasonal variation) as well as the distribution and residence time of the herbicides atrazine, simazine, and terbutylazine and of the primary atrazine metabolites hydroxyatrazine, desethylatrazine, and deisopropylatrazine in three Swiss lakes exhibiting quite different catchment areas and/or hydraulic properties. The results obtained from numerous field measurements (period of 5 years, 1990-1994) combined with computer simulations indicate that all compounds investigated showed a conservative behavior in the water column of the lakes (i.e., no elimination other than by flushing), except for a short period in the summer, where some minor elimination occurred in the epilimnion. The major input of both the parent triazine herbicides and the metabolites occurred in the epilimnion during or right after the application period. For atrazine, the most abundant of the three herbicides investigated, it is shown that the total annual input depended strongly on the rainfall during the application period. For a given lake, the annual input varied between 0.5% (dry weather) and 2% (very wet weather) of the total amount applied in the catchment area. For different lakes receiving similar amounts of rainfall, very similar input fractions were found despite the significantly different catchment areas. Among the metabolites, desethylatrazine occurred at levels similar to those for atrazine, while hydroxyatrazine and deisopropylatrazine were present at 2-4 times lower levels. Note that this study provides the first quantitative data on the transport of hydroxyatrazine from soils to surface waters. The results of this study form an important base for assessing or predicting past, present, and future inputs of triazines to lakes for which only limited data are available. Finally, this study demonstrates that small lakes exhibiting a well-characterized catchment area represent excellent experimental field systems for evaluating quantitatively the transport characteristics of herbicides and their metabolites from soils to surface waters and for assessing the persistence of such compounds in surface waters.					; Berg, Michael/C-3738-2012	Berg, Michael/0000-0002-7342-4061; 													0013-936X					JUL	1997	31	7					2104	2113		10.1021/es9609314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9609314													WOS:A1997XH48300061
J	Cann, MD; Friedrich, K				Cann, Matthew D.; Friedrich, K.			The Role of Moisture Pathways on Snowfall Amount and Distribution in the Payette Mountains of Idaho	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The pathways air travels from the Pacific Ocean to the Intermountain West of the United States are important for understanding how air characteristics change and how this translates to the amount and distribution of snowfall. Recent studies have identified the most common moisture pathways in the Intermountain West, especially for heavy precipitation events. However, the role of moisture pathways on snowfall amount and distribution in specific regions remains unclear. Here, we investigate 24 precipitation events in the Payette Mountains of Idaho during January-March 2017 to understand how local atmospheric conditions are tied to three moisture pathways and how it impacts snowfall amount and distribution. During one pathway, southwesterly, moist, tropical air is directed into the Central Valley of California where the air is blocked by the Sierra Nevada, redirected northward and over lower terrain north of Lake Tahoe into the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Other pathways consist of unblocked flows that approach the coast of California from the southwest and then override the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades, and zonal flows approaching the coast of Oregon overriding the Oregon Cascades. Air masses in the Payette Mountains of Idaho associated with Sierra-blocked flow were observed to be warmer, moister, and windier compared to the other moisture pathways. During Sierra-blocked flow, higher snowfall rates, in terms of mean reflectivity, were observed more uniformly distributed throughout the region compared to the other flows, which observed lower snowfall rates that were predominantly collocated with areas of higher terrain. Of the total estimated snowfall captured in this study, 67% was observed during Sierra-blocked flow.

J	Getchell, RG; Wooster, GA; Bowser, PR				Getchell, RG; Wooster, GA; Bowser, PR			Temperature-associated regression of walleye dermal sarcoma tumors	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												A temperature-associated model for tumor regression was established using the virally induced walleye dermal sarcoma (WDS). In one trial, walleyes Stizostedion vitreum received a topical application of a cell-free dermal sarcoma tumor filtrate and were allowed to develop grossly visible tumors at 15 degreesC for 5 months. The walleyes were then randomly placed into one of three temperature treatment groups (10, 15, or 20 degreesC) and grossly examined at monthly intervals for the presence of tumors. The rates of tumor regression (calculated as incidence densities) were compared across groups. The regression of WDS tumors was associated with increased temperature over the course of the 10-month study. The incidence of tumor regression was significantly higher in walleyes held at 15 or 20 degreesC than in those held at 10 degreesC. In another trial (which more closely replicated the temperatures of Oneida Lake, New York, during the early spring, when WDS transmission is thought to occur), tumors were allowed to develop at 10 degreesC for 1 month and then at 1.5 degreesC for 5 months, before the temperature was increased to 20 degreesC. In this trial, walleyes were tagged with transmitters so that they could be individually identified during the monthly survey of tumor status. Rates of regression observed were less than those in the first trial.

COPPER-MOLYBDENUM-INORGANIC SULPHATE INTERACTION IN ROTTNEST QUOKKA, SETONIX BRACHYURUS (QUOY AND GAIMARD)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												An investigation was commenced to determine whether induced Cu depletion caused the seasonal anemia known to occur in 2 populations of the quokka, Setonix brachyurus, on Rottnest Island, West Australia Long-term feeding of Mo and inorganic S04- depressed liver and blood Cu levels but anemia was not produced. In experimental quokkas a relationship was found between absolute daily Cu intake and Cu levels in the feces. Blood samples were collected from adult quokkas captured in 2 study areas on Rottnest Island during 1958-59. Quokkas from West End usually had higher blood Cu levels and lower blood Mo levels than those from Lake Bagdad. Higher plant Mo levels at Lake Bagdad account for the higher blood Mo levels in these quokkas than in West End quokkas. Differences in blood Cu levels between quokkas living in the 2 areas are not accounted for by differences in Cu intake, as fecal Cu levels of quokkas caught in the 2 areas were similar at the same times of the year. A negative correlation was found to exist between blood Cu and blood Mo levels in Lake Bagdad quokkas, but not in those from West End. This and the experimental findings suggest that in the former blood Cu levels were depressed by a higher Mo intake. A positive correlation was found to exist between blood Cu and hemoglobin levels in Lake Bagdad quokkas but not in West End quokkas. Although this implies that Cu depletion is associated with the seasonal anemia, mean blood Cu levels of Lake Bagdad quokkas at the end of summer were similar to mean blood Cu levels of the experimental quokkas, and no experimental anemia was produced. Induced Cu depletion alone does not cause the seasonal anemia but it is one factor associated with it in Lake Bagdad quokkas and not in West End quokkas.																			0004-9417						1961	14	4					646	+		10.1071/BI9610646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BI9610646													WOS:A19616079A00003
J	Rohrlack, T				Rohrlack, Thomas			Can osmotrophy in Gonyostomum semen explain why lake browning drives an expansion of the alga in parts of Europe?	LIMNOLOGICA												Gonyostomum semen experiences a remarkable expansion in parts of Europe, partially driven by rising levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM), also called lake browning. One way to explain the stimulating effect of browning is to assume that G. semen combines photosynthesis with osmotrophy, the ability to utilize DOM as source of nutrients or energy. The present work tested this idea on a nearly unialgal G. semen bloom. Continuous vertical profiling found that each night, G. semen moved into the oxic-anoxic interface or the anoxic hypolimnion, i.e., into places where redox processes can give access to DOM via dissolution of ferric oxide-organic matter complexes. In the hypolimnion, conditions were right for a build-up of DOM, which, however, never happened. Optical analyses of hypolimnetic DOM indicated that the build-up was prevented by the removal of terrestrially derived DOM, which was correlated with G. semen. During the daytime, G. semen migrated into the epilimnion. Here, net oxygen production was near zero, indicating that G. semen combined photosynthesis with heterotrophic nutrition. Optical analyses of epilimnetic DOM hinted at the utilization of terrestrially derived DOM. Taken together, the above findings provide circumstantial evidence for G. semen combining photosynthesis with osmotrophy in nature. The proposed utilization of terrestrially derived DOM suggests that lake browning may favor G. semen by improving the access to DOM that the alga can utilize. Browning may also benefit G. semen by promoting summer anoxia that causes a reductive release of DOM from complexes with ferric oxides, improving the alga's access to DOM.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2023	101								126097	10.1016/j.limno.2023.126097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2023.126097		JUL 2023											WOS:001041639200001

IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and INF-gamma were all detected in the supernatants of whole-blood cultures after stimulation with schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) and soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP). The percentages of subjects producing detectable amounts of each cytokine assayed were higher in the group who were negative by stool examination at the start of the study than in those who were initially stool positive. After praziquantel treatment the percentages of subjects producing both type I and type II cytokines increased. This suggests that the production of both types of cytokine was down-regulated in the presence of live, egg-laying S. japonicum adult worms but that this was reversible by treatment. In contrast, the antibody studies showed higher levels of SWAP and SEA-specific antibodies (IgE, total IgG, IgG4, IgM) in subjects who were originally stool-positive than in those who were stool-negative. After treatment specific IgE responses were elevated, but total IgG and IgG4 anti-SEA and IgM anti-SWAP antibody levels all fell significantly.

J	Schütt, B; Berking, J; Frechen, M; Yi, CL				Schuett, Brigitta; Berking, Jonas; Frechen, Manfred; Yi, Chaolu			Late Pleistocene Lake Level Fluctuations of the Nam Co, Tibetan Plateau, China	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												The endorheic Nam Co Lake, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, was selected to investigate the interrelation between post-glacial glacier decay and lake level fluctuations. During the transition between MIS 2 and MIS1 glacier decay caused regional changes in water balance and a rise in lake level, which is presently shown by a marked cliff line visible all around Nam Co, with its base approx. 29 m above the present lake level. Simultaneously occurring melt water floods caused channel incision into the Pleistocene fan deposits; presently new fans arc being deposited where the channels discharge into the wave-cut platform. More Holocene beach ridges on the wave-cut platform downslope of the cliff line are evidence of oscillating Holocene lake levels. LGM ice cap estimates for the tributary Nyainqentanghla Range explain about 50% of the post-glacial lake volume growth compared to the present lake level. The remaining 50% of post-glacial lake volume growth originates from increased inflow from the western and northern tributaries. As Nam Co is an endorheic lake, post-glacial water loss is primarily due to evaporation and moisture conditions. To understand late glacial interaction between glacier retreat and lake level fluctuation, a test site in the southeast of the Nam Co area was selected; investigations included geomorphological mapping, survey by DGPS and statistical data analysis.																			0372-8854	1864-1687				SEP	2008	52			2			57	75		10.1127/0372-8854/2008/0052S2-0057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0372-8854/2008/0052S2-0057													WOS:000261001200005

Sediment respiration measurements were made in situ under ambient light conditions. The flux of CO2 between sediment and water varied between an uptake of 53 and an efflux of 182 mg C m(-2) day(-1) from the sediments. The mean respiration rate for sediments in contact with the upper mixed layer (SedR) was positively correlated to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the water (r(2) = 0.61). The net flux of CO2 across the lake surface [net ecosystem exchange (NEE)] was also closely correlated to DOC concentration in the upper mixed layer (r(2) = 0.73). The respiration in the water column was generally 10-fold higher per unit lake area compared to sediment respiration. Lakes with DOC concentrations < 5.6 mg L-1 had net consumption of CO2 in the sediments, which we ascribe to benthic primary production. Only lakes with very low DOC concentrations were net autotrophic (< 2.6 mg L-1) due to the dominance of dissolved allochthonous organic carbon in the water as an energy source for aquatic organisms. In addition to previous findings of allochthonous organic matter as an important driver of heterotrophic metabolism in the water column of lakes, this study suggests that sediment metabolism is also highly dependent on allochthonous carbon sources.

Critical View of Overland Flow Estimation in Semi-arid Catchments Under Land Subsidence with Long-term Field Measurements	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												An investigation is presented in this paper to predict Overland Flows (OF) from Rain-Falls (RF) and a set of covariates in semi-arid catchments. The study area comprises 8 catchments in the basin of Lake Urmia and its vicinity, where the catchments are at risk of land subsidence through mismanagement triggered by groundwater over-abstraction but received wisdom often implicates the problems with climate change. The paper presents a new perspective, where land subsidence by over-abstraction can impact OF regimes and thereby infiltration regimes. A strategy is formulated at three levels to abstract information from the data/results. At innovative Level 1, the research direction is scoped critically and referenced with reality. At Level 2, modelling results are catered for to be fit-for-purpose. At Level 3, the data/results are critically examined for learning. The data/results are found consistent with the observed reality that (i) a fit-for-purpose OF predictive model can be derived in terms of RF and covariates; (ii) indirect evidence reveals flow regimes of infiltration (interflow and percolation), OF and groundwater are altering, such that percolation is likely to decline and undermine aquifer replenishment regimes when exposed to subsidence risk with subsequent permanent damage. This makes a case for research, effective planning and sustainable drainage systems.

Population Structure and Dynamics of Northern Pike and Smallmouth Bass in Coeur d'Alene Lake, Idaho	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Numerous species have been introduced to Coeur d'Alene Lake, Idaho over the last century, but minimal research has been completed to understand their population dynamics. The objective of this study was to describe the population demographics and dynamics of northern pike (Esox lucius) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), two important nonnative sport fishes in the system to provide information that will assist with guiding management decisions. The oldest northern pike was age 7 and the oldest smallmouth bass was age 11. Populations of both species exhibited very stable recruitment with a recruitment coefficient of determination of 0.99 for northern pike and 0.98 for smallmouth bass. Total annual mortality was estimated as 66% for northern pike and 42% for smallmouth bass. Growth of northern pike in Coeur d'Alene Lake was comparable to the 50-75th percentiles of growth exhibited by lentic northern pike populations across North America. Northern pike in Coeur d'Alene Lake were most similar to populations in the north-central and northeast United States with fast growth rates and short life spans. In contrast, smallmouth bass grew slowly and generally fell within the 5th percentile of lentic smallmouth bass populations in North America. Smallmouth bass in Coeur d'Alene Lake were similar to other populations in northern regions of the United States displaying slow growth rates with high longevity. Results of this study provide important insight on nonnative northern pike and smallmouth bass population dynamics.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	2015	89	3					280	296																WOS:000367363600007

One reason for the failure of these efforts appears to be that models used for watershed P management have understated and misrepresented the role of in-stream processes in shaping watershed P export. Here, we update the latest release of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+), a widely used watershed management model, to better represent in-stream P retention and remobilization (SWAT+P.R&R). We add new streambed pools where P is stored and tracked, and we incorporate three new processes driving in-stream P dynamics: (a) deposition and resuspension of sediment-associated P, (b) diffusion of dissolved P between the water column and streambed, and (c) adsorption and desorption of mineral P. The objective of this modeling work is to provide a diagnostic tool that enables researchers to challenge existing assumptions regarding how watersheds store, transform, and transport P. Here, in a first diagnostic analysis, SWAT+P.R&R helps reconcile in-stream P retention theory (that P is retained at low flows and remobilized at high flows) and a discordant data set in our validation watershed. SWAT+P.R&R results (a) clarify that the theorized relationship between P retention and flow is only valid (for this point-source affected testbed, at least) at the temporal scale of a single rising-or-falling hydrograph limb and (b) illustrate that hysteresis obscures the relationship at longer temporal scales. Future work using SWAT+P.R&R could further challenge assumptions regarding timescales of in-stream P legacies and sources of P load variability.

J	Mustoe, GE				Mustoe, George E.			Cyclic sedimentation in the Eocene Allenby Formation of south-central British Columbia and the origin of the Princeton Chert fossil beds	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Extensive deposits of Eocene conglomerate, sandstone, shale, and sub-bituminous coal occur within a half-graben at Princeton, British Columbia. These strata comprise similar to 2000 m of fluvial sediment interbedded with tephra and volcanic flows. Near the southeast margin of the basin, similar to 200 m of rhythmically bedded strata are exposed along the Similkameen River. Cyclic deposition resulted from repeated episodes of hydrologic and topographic change related to seismic activity along the Boundary Fault on the east flank of the Princeton Basin, where Allenby Formation sediments are juxtaposed against metamorphic and metavolcanic rocks of the Upper Triassic Nicola Group. Interbedded carbonaceous shale and tuffaceous sandstone record influxes of distal lahar deposits into a lowland swamp. Coal-breccia transitions originated when debris flows along the scarp carried volcanic debris into adjacent wetlands. Coal-chert rhythmites are inferred to be evidence of hydrologic changes associated with floodplain tilt events that caused lowland to repeatedly alternate between a stagnant pond ("fen") and a stream-fed lake. During fen stages, peat was silicified in situ from percolation of groundwater carrying silica dissolved from underlying tuffaceous beds. Episodic influxes of stream flow reduced dissolved silica concentrations and caused increases in dissolved oxygen levels. These geochemical changes caused organic matter that accumulated during these conditions of open water circulation to remain unsilicified and susceptible to partial maceration. Diagenesis eventually converted these deposits to alternating beds of sub-bituminous coal intercalated with																			0008-4077					JAN	2011	48	1					25	43		10.1139/E10-085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E10-085													WOS:000286476200003

Georgenthalia clavinasica, a new genus and species of dissorophoid temnospondyl from the Early Permian of Germany, and the relationships of the family Amphibamidae	JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY												Georgenthalia clavinasica, a new genus and species of amphibamid dissorophoid temnospondyl, is represented by a small, complete, postmetamorphic skull from the Lower Permian Bromacker locality, Germany. It is only the third non-amniote of an assemblage of 12 terrestrial tetrapod taxa known from this locality. It is characterized by a broadly rounded skull with large orbits, a short postorbital length, and a unique keyhole-shaped external naris superficially resembling that of trematopid dissorophoids. New features that help to discriminate between amphibamid species are highlighted. Phylogenetically informative characters present in G. clavinasica include: anterolateral flaring of the lateral margin of frontals; narrow interorbital width; ventral orbital process of the prefrontal contacts palatine; palatine exposed on lateral surface of ventral rim of orbit; large otic notches closely approach the orbits; absence of a supratympanic flange of otic notch; long supratympanic process of squamosal with flange-like process that underlaps the midcentral portion of supratemporal. Several features support a highly terrestrial habitus of G. clavinasica, which is consistent with the interpretation of the fossiliferous beds of the Bromacker quarry as representing an upland terrestrial environment in which limnic conditions were characterized by ephemeral lakes and ponds. A new clade, Olsoniformes, is named for Dissorophidae and Trematopidae (dissorophoids exclusive of Amphibamidae), and new phylogenetic definitions for Amphibamidae, Trematopidae, and Dissorophidae are presented. The small neotenic Micromelerpetontidae, and presumably also the neotenic and larval Branchiosauridae, fall within the newly defined clade Amphibamidae in the current study, and future work should focus on clarifying the nature of this relationship.																			0272-4634	1937-2809				MAR 12	2008	28	1					61	75		10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[61:GCANGA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[61:GCANGA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000254408700007

Genetic and biogeographic relationships of the racer goby Neogobius gymnotrachelus (Gobiidae: Teleostei) from introduced and native Eurasian locations	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The racer goby Neogobius gymnotrachelus, along with several other neogobiin fishes, has been spreading north and west from its native Ponto-Caspian range for the past two decades via shipping and canals. It has been predicted as a likely future invader of the North American Great Lakes, where it would join its neogobiin relatives - the found and freshwater tubenose gobies. The present study is the first to analyse the population genetic and biogeographic relationships of the racer goby, establishing a baseline to aid interpretation of its future spread patterns and likely donor-recipient population relationships. The mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene was sequenced from representative areas of the racer goby's range, including rivers of the northern Black Sea and areas of spread upstream in the Danube River and outside the Ponto-Caspian region to the Vistula River in Poland. Results discerned nine haplotypes, with few shared among drainages of native rivers and most sites housing unique alleles. Racer goby populations significantly diverged among watersheds, supporting historic low migration and little non-anthropogenic gene flow. The Dnieper River was identified as a likely donor source for the Vistula River colonization, where appreciable variability suggests a relatively large number of founding genotypes.

(water lettuce) in the paleo-sediments of Lake Annie, Florida	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) is a floating tropical macrophyte long identified and managed as a non-native species within the State of Florida and other areas of the southern United States. Macrofossil seeds from Lake Annie, Florida, however, indicate abundant presence of P. stratiotes intermixed with other locally native macrophytes from similar to 13,500 to similar to 12,000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP). This was soon after the lake depression first began filling with water as the piezometric groundwater surface of the Florida peninsula rose in response to rising seas during the transition (similar to 18,000 to similar to 11,000 cal yr BP) from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene interglacial. These macrofossil records join several other lines of evidence supporting native status of P. stratiotes in the Florida peninsula. While recent cryptic invasion of non-native Pistia genotypes into some of Florida's freshwater ecosystems also appears likely, confirmed paleo-presence and contemporary persistence of native P. stratiotes subpopulations may have especially important management and conservation implications for Florida's spring-fed streams. Palaeobotanical evidence of this type may be useful in further resolving the global biogeography of P. stratiotes and other cryptic aquatic plant species.					; Grimm, Eric/G-3011-2013; Evans, Jason/LLL-7536-2024	Jacobson, George/0000-0002-0406-340X; Evans, Jason/0000-0002-5399-012X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2024	72	1					1	13		10.1007/s10933-024-00311-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-024-00311-5		MAR 2024											WOS:001190318000001

Assessment of pollution and trophic state of a water hyacinth infested tropical highland lake: Lake Tana in Ethiopia	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Freshwater quality is declining globally due to changes in natural and human-driven land use. Lake Tana, Ethiopia's largest lake, exemplifies this change. Human activities within its watershed have pushed it toward a trophic state, evident in the expansion of water hyacinths since 2011. This research aimed to evaluate the degree of pollution and trophic state of Lake Tana and identify the most important factors for effective management strategies. Eleven water quality parameters were collected from 20 sampling stations in Lake Tana from July 2018 to June 2019. Spatial distribution maps for water quality, trophic state and pollution index were generated using ArcMap. Water quality indicators were explored through factor analysis (FA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Lake Tana's trophic level index ranges from 37.1 (oligotrophic) to 87.9 (hypereutrophic) annually. The pollution index classification indicated that the lake fell within categories three and four, changing from slightly polluted to polluted. According to the PCA and FA methods, oxygen depletion, nutrients, eutrophication, and suspended solids are identified as major factors influencing deteriorating water quality. Shores exhibit higher eutrophication and pollution levels than pelagic zones. Thus, all stakeholders must actively participate in management strategies prioritizing coastal areas and targeting the identified pollution factors.

J	Urban, RA; Titus, JE; Zhu, WX				Urban, Rebecca A.; Titus, John E.; Zhu, Wei-Xing			Shading by an invasive macrophyte has cascading effects on sediment chemistry	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The submersed freshwater macrophyte Utricularia inflata is a recent invader of Adirondack Mountain lakes (NY, USA). Previous experiments suggested that U. inflata can indirectly change nutrient cycling in Adirondack lake ecosystems by reducing the growth of native isoetid macrophytes, which in turn affects sediment chemistry. A 13-week greenhouse experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that shading can explain the detrimental effect of U. inflata on the native short-statured isoetid, Eriocaulon aquaticum. Eriocaulon aquaticum has a dense root system that oxidizes sediment by releasing oxygen; it also takes up carbon dioxide from sediment. Growth and asexual reproduction of E. aquaticum grown under shaded conditions was reduced significantly compared to an unshaded control (P < 0.001). Shading resulted in sediment changes: redox potential fell from 216 mV in the absence of shading to 76 mV under four layers of shade cloth (P < 0.0001). Shading also increased the concentration of extractable sediment ammonium (P < 0.01), as well as carbon dioxide concentrations (P < 0.0001) and pH of porewater (P < 0.05). The effect of U. inflata on the native isoetids and consequently on sediment chemistry closely matched the impact of shade cloth with similar light attenuation. Our results indicate that the principal mechanism by which U. inflata affects native isoetids and sediment chemistry is shading.

J	Krumgalz, BS; Hecht, A; Starinsky, A; Katz, A				Krumgalz, BS; Hecht, A; Starinsky, A; Katz, A			Thermodynamic constraints on Dead Sea evaporation: can the Dead Sea dry up?	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The relation between climatic parameters (relative air humidity) and the water activity of the Dead Sea water determines the possible maximum evaporation of the lake. Using the Pitzer thermodynamic approach, the activity of the Dead Sea water during evaporation was calculated and compared to the present relative air humidity above the water. Long-term (1992-1997) quasi-continuous meteorological data acquired at sea provide detailed information on the patterns and trends of the relative humidity above the lake. Present climatic conditions allow the Dead Sea water to evaporate down to a water activity of 0.50, corresponding to the lowest air humidity measured over the lake. This water activity falls in the range of halite precipitation, while carnallite precipitation starts somewhat lower (a(H2O) = 0.49). Our dynamic model predicts that for air humidity as low as 50% (reflecting present climate conditions), the Dead Sea level may drop to as low as -500 m (i.e., 500 m below mean sea level). At that point, the lake will have a volume of 88 km(3) and a surface area of 526 km(2). For the sake of comparison, at the beginning of 1977, after the southern basin of the Dead Sea was separated from the northern basin, the level of the lake was -402 m, its volume was 146 km(3), and its surface area was 815 km(2).

P.			Effects of diclofenac on the swimming behavior and antioxidant enzyme activities of the freshwater interstitial crustacean Bryocamptus pygmaeus (Crustacea, Harpacticoida)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most widespread pharmaceutical compounds found in freshwaters as a pseudo-persistent pollutant due to its continuous release from point and diffuse sources, being its removal in Wastewater Treatment Plants incomplete. Moreover, DCF is particularly persistent in interstitial habitats and potentially toxic for the species that spend their whole life cycle among the same sediment grains. This study is aimed at offering a first contribution to the assessment of DCF effects on freshwater invertebrate species living in the interstitial habitats of springs, rivers, lakes and groundwaters. The Crustacea Copepoda are one of the main components of the freshwater interstitial communities, with the primacy taken by the worm-like and small-sized harpacticoids. A sub-lethal concentration of 50 mu g L-1 DCF significantly affected six out of the eight behavior parameters of the burrower/interstitial crustacean harpacticoid Bryocamptus pygmaeus recorded by video tracking analysis. DCF exposure reduced swimming speed, swimming activity, exploration ability and thigmotaxis, and increased swimming path tortuosity. The biochemical approach revealed a reduced level of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 in individuals exposed to DCF. It could be explained by a decline in mitochondrial performance or by a reduced number of functional mitochondria. Since mitochondrial dysfunction may determine ATP reduction, it comes that less energy is produced for maintaining the cell functions of the DCF-exposed individuals. In addition, the increasing energy demand for the detoxification process further contributes to decrease the total energetic budget allocated for other physiological activities. These observations can explain the changes we have observed in the swimming behavior of the copepod B. pygmaeus. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To help fill the void, a popular species, Ceratophyllum demersum L. was chosen to address the effects and mechanisms of submerged macrophyte growth on the processes of P exchange across the sediment-water interface. In treatment mesocosms (planted), equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0) value falls from 68.4 to 36.0 mu g/L, with a mean value of 52.5 mu g/L. Conversely, the distribution coefficient (Kd) value has a predominantly increasing trend. But they are both significantly higher than an unplanted control (p < 0.05). Also, in the planted mesocosm, maximum phosphate sorption capacity (Q(max)) was significantly reduced (4,721-3,845 mg/kg), and most of the linear correlations between different forms of phosphorus and sediment P adsorption parameters were affected (p < 0.05). The EPC0 Percentage Saturation percentages (EPCsat) in planted groups were 325% higher than that in control (p < 0.05). We conclude that C. demersum could promote the release of P from sediments, and soluble reactive phosphorus concentration in overlying water is probably the driving force for P exchange at the sediment-water interface.

Part II: Analysis of lake surface temperature and ice cover	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper presents results from a study on the impact of remote-sensing Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) observations in the analysis of lake surface state of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Data assimilation experiments were performed with the High Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM), a three-dimensional operational NWP model. Selected thermal remote-sensing LSWT observations provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) sensors onboard the Terra/Aqua and ENVISAT satellites, respectively, were included into the assimilation. The domain of our experiments, which focussed on two winters (2010 - 2011 and 2011 - 2012), covered northern Europe. Validation of the resulting objective analyses against independent observations demonstrated that the description of the lake surface state can be improved by the introduction of space-borne LSWT observations, compared to the result of pure prognostic parameterisations or assimilation of the available limited number of in-situ lake temperature observations. Further development of the data assimilation methods and solving of several practical issues are necessary in order to fully benefit from the space-borne observations of lake surface state for the improvement of the operational weather forecast. This paper is the second part of a series of two papers aimed at improving the objective analysis of lake temperature and ice conditions in HIRLAM.

Responses of lake phytoplankton to micronutrient enrichment: a study in two New Zealand lakes and an analysis of published data	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Natural and anthropogenic changes in nutrient concentrations can affect phytoplankton in marine and freshwater environments. However, potential micronutrient limitation of phytoplankton productivity in fresh waters is often overlooked. To investigate the responses of lake phytoplankton to micronutrient enrichment, we conducted a study in two contrasting New Zealand lakes, and analysed data from the published international literature.We undertook nutrient enrichment bioassays of phytoplankton communities sampled from a mesotrophic reservoir and an eutrophic coastal lake to determine the relative occurrence of micronutrient (iron, boron, cobalt, copper, molybdenum) and macronutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus) limitation. In the mesotrophic reservoir, phytoplankton productivity was phosphorus limited. No evidence of micronutrient limitation was found in six bioassays in summer. In the eutrophic lake, tenfold enrichment of ambient micronutrient concentrations increased the primary productivity in four of 11 bioassays. During a cyanobacterial bloom in the eutrophic lake, experimental enrichment with boron, cobalt, copper or molybdenum increased primary productivity by 40%. These four micronutrients are commonly applied as agricultural fertiliser in the lake's catchment. Nitrogen or phosphorus enrichment had no effect on phytoplankton productivity at this time. Micronutrient limitation has been reported in more than 40 lakes internationally, and our analysis of published data suggests that the prevalence of micronutrient limitation is unrelated to lake size or trophic state. As micronutrient enrichment can significantly increase phytoplankton productivity in a range of lakes types, the potential contribution of micronutrient enrichment to eutrophication should not be overlooked.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				DEC	2008	70	4					347	360		10.1007/s00027-008-8065-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-008-8065-6													WOS:000261329000001

These lakes alone account for 90% of the inland water resource of the entire country. Due to the agricultural. and industrial uses of the lake water and their main economic relevance, linked to the recreational vacation of the entire sub-alpine environment, a large monitoring programme for their conservation is justified. Two Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data acquired in March 1997 were used to compare the different behaviour of the lakes water in Spring, when the main algae bloom occurs. Water quality parameters were extracted by means of the chromaticity analysis: Landsat Chromaticity System (LCS) uses absolute radiance values from the satellite and derive the trophic state of the waters in terms of "redness" X, "greenness" Y, and "blueness" Z of water colour, related to the suspended materials, to the chlorophyll concentration and to the water turbidity, respectively. Moreover water surface temperature was derived from radiometrically corrected TM band 6 and the influence of water volume and altitude on water surface temperature and the relation among them were formalised.

First occurrence of the mysid Hemimysis anomala GO Sars, 1907 in Lake Stechlin, Germany	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												The Black, Azov and Caspian Seas are donor hotspots for non-native species, with many species from the region highly tolerant of abiotic stressors and able to successfully establish, spread and exert impacts around the world. Here we document a new introduction of the bloody red mysid shrimp, Hemimysis anomala G.O. Sars, 1907. Discovered for the first time in January 2023 in Lake Stechlin, Germany, at high densities, many questions surround its potential impacts in this deep, formerly oligotrophic, now meso-eutrophic lake of major geological, cultural and ecological importance. Using molecular and morphological identification, the identity of H. anomala from two sites in the lake was confirmed. Unlike other mysids normally detected over deeper waters in lakes at night, H. anomala has so far only been detected near the surface and at depths shallower than 30 m, but during both night and day, in winter. We outline vital areas for future research and the need for dedicated sampling methods by also highlighting a case study from Lake M & uuml;ggelsee, Berlin, where the species has been known to exist for over 20 years without being caught in regular plankton tows.					; Nejstgaard, Jens/LSK-4151-2024; Dickey, James/LZI-6001-2025	Jeschke, Jonathan/0000-0003-3328-4217; 													2242-1300					NOV	2024	13	4					927	940		10.3391/bir.2024.13.4.07	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2024.13.4.07													WOS:001381820700007
J	Atakul-Özdemir, A				Atakul-Ozdemir, Ayse			Paleogeographic implications of the Permian shallow marine carbonates in the eastern Lake Van region (eastern Turkey): Foraminiferal biostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic constraints	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The study focuses on the Middle Permian recrystallized limestone succession, previously considered as Triassic, at the eastern parts of Lake Van (eastern Turkey) representing the northern margin of Gondwana. The Middle Permian successions in the region are mainly composed of slightly metamorphosed, recrystallized limestones. The shallow-water depositional settings of the studied units are characterized by the relative dominance of smaller foraminifers and rare occurrence of fusulinids. Middle Permian foraminifers recorded from eastern Anatolia are typically Tethyan assemblages for the Capitanian (Guadalupian) age. Detailed microfacies analysis by textural analysis and faunal assemblages have been undertaken throughout the studied sections. The Capitanian carbonates of the region are mainly characterized by six major microfacies types representing shallow marine environments, ranging from foreshoal environment to shoal and backshoal environments. Within the scope of sequence stratigraphic interpretations, vertical stacking patterns of these microfacies types reflecting different depositional environments reveal the presence of two third-order depositional sequences, each of which consists of a transgressive systems tract and a highstand systems tract. Within the context of sequence stratigraphy, the microfacies changes point out the relative sea-level fall towards the upper part of the sections, coinciding with the onset of a regression recorded worldwide in the Capitanian.

The High-Lakes Project	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The High Lakes Project is a multidisciplinary astrobiological investigation studying high-altitude lakes between 4200 m and 6000 m elevation in the Central Andes of Bolivia and Chile. Its primary objective is to understand the impact of increased environmental stress on the modification of lake habitability potential during rapid climate change as an analogy to early Mars. Their unique geophysical environment and mostly uncharted ecosystems have added new objectives to the project, including the assessment of the impact of low-ozone/high solar irradiance in nonpolar aquatic environments, the documentation of poorly known ecosystems, and the quantification of the impact of climate change on lake environment and ecosystem. Data from 2003 to 2007 show that UV flux is 165% that of sea level with maximum averaged UVB reaching 4 W/m(2). Short UV wavelengths (260-270 nm) were recorded and peaked at 14.6 mW/m(2). High solar irradiance occurs in an atmosphere permanently depleted in ozone falling below ozone hole definition for 33-36 days and between 30 and 35% depletion the rest of the year. The impact of strong UVB and UV erythemally weighted daily dose on life is compounded by broad daily temperature variations with sudden and sharp fluctuations. Lake habitat chemistry is highly dynamical with notable changes in yearly ion concentrations and pH resulting from low and variable yearly precipitation. The year-round combination of environmental variables define these lakes as end-members. In such an environment, they host ecosystems that include a significant fraction of previously undescribed species of zooplankton, cyanobacterial, and bacterial populations.					; Demergasso, Cecilia/A-7392-2013; smith, Eric/KGL-0324-2024; Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020; chong, guillermo/MAH-3688-2025; Chong, Guillermo/MAH-3688-2025; Dorador, Cristina/M-9936-2019	Dorador, Cristina/0000-0002-7641-2154; Ukstins, Ingrid/0000-0002-2315-9626; Demergasso, Cecilia/0000-0003-4563-3066; Cabrol, Nathalie A./0000-0001-7520-4364; chong, guillermo/0000-0003-2979-8864; Galvez, Matthieu Emmanuel/0000-0001-8242-9190; Tambley, Cristian/0009-0007-6845-2221													2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV 5	2009	114								G00D06	10.1029/2008JG000818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JG000818													WOS:000271580900001
J	WURTSBAUGH, WA				WURTSBAUGH, WA			FOOD-WEB MODIFICATION BY AN INVERTEBRATE PREDATOR IN THE GREAT-SALT-LAKE (USA)	OECOLOGIA												During unusually wet years the salinity of the Great Salt Lake (Utah) decreased from above 100 g/L to 50 g/L. This allowed the predaceous insect Trichocorixa verticalis to invade the pelagic region of the lake and reach a mean summer density of 52/m3. Concurrent changes in the pelagic ecosystem were: a decrease in the dry biomass of the previously dominant filter-feeding brine shrimp Artemia franciscana from 720 to 2 mg/m3, the invasion of three other zooplankton taxa, a 10 x decrease in community filtration rate, a 20 x increase in chlorophyll a concentration, a 4 x decrease in water clarity and perhaps a decrease in soluble nutrients. Trichocorixa abundance was also inversely correlated with the abundance of Artemia along a salinity gradient in the lake's estuary. In a 9-d microcosm experiment Trichocorixa preyed on nauplii and decreased the total density of Artemia from 103 to 6/L. The reduction in Artemia allowed protozoans to increase 10-100 x. Changes in chlorophyll and clarity were consistent with those observed in the lake. These results suggest that invertebrate predation may be an important factor structuring simple food webs such as those found in moderately saline lakes.

Threshold of wave generation on Titan's lakes and seas: Effect of viscosity and implications for Cassini observations	ICARUS												Motivated by radar and near-infrared data indicating that Titan's polar lakes are extremely smooth, we consider the conditions under which a lake surface will be ruffled by wind to form capillary waves. We evaluate laboratory data on wind generation and derive, without scaling for surface tension effects, a threshold for pure methane/ethane of similar to 0.5-1 m/s. However, we compute the physical properties of predicted Titan lake compositions using the National Institute for Standards Technology (NIST) code and note that dissolved amounts of C3 and C4 compounds are likely to make Titan lakes much more viscous than pure ethane or methane, even without allowing for suspended particulates which would increase the viscosity further. Wind tunnel experiments show a strong dependence of capillary wave growth on liquid viscosity, and this effect may explain the apparent absence so far of waves, contrary to prior expectations that generation of gravity waves by wind should be easy on Titan. On the other hand, we note that winds over Titan lakes predicted with the TitanWRF Global Circulation Model indicate radar observations so far have in any case been when winds have been low (similar to 0.5-0.7 m/s), possibly below the wave generation threshold, while peak winds during summer may reach 1-2 m/s. Thus observations of Titan's northern lakes during the coming years by the Cassini Solstice mission offer the highest probability of observing wind-roughening of lake surfaces, while observations of Ontario Lacus in the south will likely continue to show it to be flat and smooth.

J	NAGELI, A; SCHANZ, F				NAGELI, A; SCHANZ, F			THE INFLUENCE OF EXTRACELLULAR ALGAL PRODUCTS ON THE SURFACE-TENSION OF WATER	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												By means of laboratory experiments and field investigations in Lake Zurich, the influence of extracellular algal products on the surface tension of water was investigated. Of interest to us was the question of whether a reduction in the surface tension, i.e. surface pressure, is dependent on (i) algal species or phytoplankton and phytoneuston community, (ii) the growth phase of the species or community concerned, and (iii) the abundance or concentration of phytoplankton and phytoneuston biomass. A dependence was ascertained in the case of the first two points. The laboratory experiments showed that extracellular products originating from diatoms give rise to a distinctly higher surface pressure than those originating from green and blue-green algae; and that the change in surface pressure occurs during the later part of the stationary algal growth phase. In Lake Zurich, high values of surface pressure were measured at the time of the collapse of the diatom bloom, and comparatively low values during the period of dominance of the blue-green alga Oscillatoria rubescens in the winter months. Changes in surface pressure established during the course of a year can thus be explained partly in terms of the phytoplankton and phytoneuston succession.																			0020-9309						1991	76	1					89	103		10.1002/iroh.19910760110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760110													WOS:A1991GB67400009

Under-ice salinity transport in low-salinity waterbodies	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In cold and temperate climates, ice typically covers the surface of waterbodies during winter. Many of these systems are also weakly saline where, unlike seawater, the temperature of maximum density, T-md, is higher than its freezing temperature, T-f. This feature of the equation of state results in a stable temperature stratification when surface waters cool below T-md. Conversely, salts excluded from the growing ice can destabilize the underlying water. Previous laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that excluded salts generate localized overturning and downward transport of salt, despite the persistence of a stable temperature gradient. Those experiments were not able to determine the processes responsible for this transport. Here, we use direct numerical simulations to visualize and characterize the plumes generated when ice excludes salt into a stable temperature gradient. We restrict our analysis to times much earlier than the diffusion timescale of temperature over the domain. We define a mass flux parameter R that considers the strength of the reverse-temperature stratification relative to the rate of salt exclusion. We identify two types of plumes whose characteristics depend mainly on R: double-diffusive salt-fingering plumes and convective plumes. The former encourages transport of salt to the bottom without significantly mixing the temperature stratification, while the latter tends to mix the water column. We apply a scaled mass flux parameter to published laboratory and field observations in low-salinity systems. These limited observations compare favorably with our numerical analysis.					; Bluteau, Cynthia Evelyn/F-3758-2011; Olsthoorn, Jason/JPX-9649-2023; Bluteau, Cynthia/F-3758-2011; Lawrence, Gregory/C-4798-2014	Olsthoorn, Jason/0000-0002-3730-6156; Bluteau, Cynthia Evelyn/0000-0002-4430-0668; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2020	65	2					247	259		10.1002/lno.11295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11295													WOS:000513136200004

Nineteen subadult Gulf sturgeon were equipped with ultrasonic transmitters (34-40 kHz) in the Choctawhatchee River and Bay during fall 1996 and 1997. before their entry into marine habitat. The movement and habitat use of Gulf sturgeon in the estuarine/marine environment was determined from November through April 1996-1999. A total of 344 sonic contacts were made in this study. We documented fish location using a GPS and recorded water depth, temperature, salinity, substrate type, and distance from shore. Subadult Gulf sturgeon migration from the freshwater riverine system to the marine system was influenced by an increase in river flow and a decrease in water temperature. Fish moved throughout Choctawhatchee Bay, but mostly used shoreline areas. The use of 5 geographic areas by 95% of telemetered Gulf sturgeon may be linked to food availability. Gulf sturgeon overwintered for 5-6 months from November through April in Choctawhatchee Bay, Santa Rosa Sound, and Pensacola Bay. After overwintering in Choctawhatchee Bay, telemetered subadults returned back to the Choctawhatchee River in late April through May when mean water temperatures ranged from 18 to 25 C. Several telemetered fish were relocated in the Muddy Lake area of the river and remained there for several days before downstream or upstream migration.																									2001							280	297																WOS:000184053000026

ATRAZINE AND INCREASED MALE PRODUCTION BY DAPHNIA: THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBINING FIELD AND LABORATORY APPROACHES	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Atrazine is one of the most commonly applied herbicides in North America and annually pulses through many midwestern stream and reservoir systems. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of atrazine to stimulate male production by Daphnia, an effect hypothesized to lower population growth rates during a period of intense larval fish predation. In the present study, populations of Daphnia parvula and Daphnia ambigua exhibited high proportions of males but no ephippial females when atrazine pulsed into Acton Lake, a small midwestern reservoir. Field results thus supported the hypothesis of excess male production by Daphnia during the spring herbicide pulse. In laboratory studies, dose-response studies, and population-level assays revealed no effect of atrazine on male production or population growth rate of multiple clones differing in reproductive strategy and exposure history. However, D. parvula increased male production in response to an endogenous crustacean hormone ( methyl farnesoate). Excess male production observed in the field population was therefore not likely caused by atrazine, although we cannot rule out the possibility of interactive effects of atrazine and some other stressor. Apparent signs of endocrine disruption in the presence of high concentrations of a suspected agent should be viewed with caution in the absence of parallel laboratory studies involving individuals from the populations of interest.

These studies allow us to distinguish a series of centennial-scale high and low lake level events between 4200 and 4000 cal BP (2899-2637 BC/2843-2416 BC) and 2600 cal BP (822-671 BC), probably due to large-scale climate changes (in the Mediterranean basin). In addition, the sediment sequence also gives evidence of a millennial-scale trend of lake level rise. It appears to be an interplay between lake level rises and falls against tectonic subsidence of the basin allowing accommodation space for sediment deposition. The variations of the lake's level and the lake's surface area influenced the development and the abandonment of the nearby lakeside settlements (like the tell of Sovjan). In order to prepare an archaeological survey around the now dried up lake, we made a 3D model of the Holocene deposit from the lake including these lake level results, geomorphological mapping, excavation data, numerous core logs, AMS C-14 dating and SRTM DEM data. The GIS model allowed us to propose four palaeogeographical reconstructions of the extension of Lake Maliq: around 14,000 BP, during the Mesolithic (around 9000 BP - 8781-8542 BC), the Early/Middle Bronze Age transition (around 3800 BP - 2310-2042 BC) and the Iron Age (2600 BP - 822-671 BC). A map of the thickness of the sediments above potential archaeological layers is also proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have indicated the occurrence of diazotrophs in Arctic coastal waters potentially of riverine origin. Here, we investigated the presence of diazotrophs in ice and surface waters of the Central Arctic Ocean in the summer of 2012. We identified diverse communities of putative diazotrophs through targeted analysis of the nifH gene, which encodes the iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme. We amplified 529 nifH sequences from 26 samples of Arctic melt ponds, sea ice and surface waters. These sequences resolved into 43 clusters at 92% amino acid sequence identity, most of which were non-cyanobacterial phylotypes from sea ice and water samples. One cyanobacterial phylotype related to Nodularia sp. was retrieved from sea ice, suggesting that this important functional group is rare in the Central Arctic Ocean. The diazotrophic community in sea-ice environments appear distinct from other cold-adapted diazotrophic communities, such as those present in the coastal Canadian Arctic, the Arctic tundra and glacial Antarctic lakes. Molecular fingerprinting of nifH and the intergenic spacer region of the rRNA operon revealed differences between the communities from river-influenced Laptev Sea waters and those from ice-related environments pointing toward a marine origin for sea-ice diazotrophs. Our results provide the first record of diazotrophs in the Central Arctic and suggest that microbial nitrogen fixation may occur north of 77 degrees N.

Haemosporidian parasites of Canada Warblers ( Cardellina canadensis) ) and Black-throated Blue Warblers ( Setophaga caerulescens): ): prevalence, diversity, and associations with physiological condition during migration	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Avian malaria ( Plasmodium spp.) and related haemosporidian parasites ( Leucocytozoon spp. and Haemoproteus spp.) are widespread in birds, yet studies investigating prevalence and diversity of haemosporidians are lacking for many Nearctic-Neotropical migrants. Furthermore, the impact that infections may have on the condition or behavior of birds during migration is still poorly understood. Here, we used nested PCR and DNA sequencing to determine parasite prevalence and identify genetic lineages of haemosporidians in Canada Warblers ( Cardellina canadensis) ) and Black-throated Blue Warblers ( Setophaga caerulescens) ) during their migration stopover on the south shore of Lake Ontario. We further evaluated if haemosporidian infections were related to immune condition, as assessed via total white blood cell (WBC) counts and heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios, or refueling patterns and/or migration timing. We found a haemosporidian prevalence of 51.5% in 66 birds; however, there was a greater haemosporidian prevalence in Black-throated Blue Warblers relative to Canada Warblers. We detected 15 cytochrome b lineages of parasites, including 4 novel lineages. In Black-throated Blue Warblers, infected birds had significantly higher total WBC counts compared to uninfected birds. Across species, females had lower H/L ratios when infected, whereas the opposite trend was observed in males. Plasma metabolites (triglyceride, (3-hydroxybutyrate, uric acid) were not associated with infection status, and infection was not related to arrival date at the spring stopover site. Results provide insight into the diversity of haemosporidians that infect two species of migratory warblers and illustrate that blood parasite infections are a routine challenge that these birds face during migration. Although haemosporidian infections may be associated with a heightened immune response in some scenarios, the findings of this correlative study provide no evidence that Canada Warblers and Black-throated Blue Warblers experience physiological or behavioral trade-offs as a result of infections.																			1712-6568					JUL	2024	19	2							12	10.5751/ACE-02723-190212	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02723-190212													WOS:001331171500001
J	Lasser, J; Nield, JM; Goehring, L				Lasser, Jana; Nield, Joanna M.; Goehring, Lucas			Surface and subsurface characterisation of salt pans expressing polygonal patterns	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												The data set described here contains information about the surface, subsurface, and environmental conditions of salt pans that express polygonal patterns in their surface salt crust (Lasser et al., 2020b; https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2020.037). Information stems from 5 field sites at Badwater Basin and 21 field sites at Owens Lake-both in central California. All data were recorded during two field campaigns from between November and December 2016 and in January 2018. Crust surfaces, including the mean diameter and fluctuations in the height of the polygonal patterns, were characterised by a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). The data contain the resulting three-dimensional point clouds that describe these surfaces. The subsurface is characterised by grain size distributions of samples taken from depths between 5 and 100 cm below the salt crust and measured with a laser particle size analyser. Subsurface salinity profiles were recorded, and the groundwater density was also measured. Additionally, the salts present in the crust and pore water were analysed to determine their composition. To characterise the environmental conditions at Owens Lake, including the differences between nearby crust features, records were made of the temperature and relative humidity during 1 week in November 2016. The field sites are characterised by images showing the general context of each site, such as pictures of selected salt polygons, including any which were sampled, a typical core from each site at which core samples were taken, and close-ups of the salt crust morphology. Finally, two videos of salt crust growth over the course of spring 2018 and reconstructed from time lapse images are included.					; Nield, Joanna/G-4916-2012; Goehring, Lucas/L-5606-2015	Lasser, Jana/0000-0002-4274-4580; Goehring, Lucas/0000-0002-3858-7295													1866-3508	1866-3516				NOV 14	2020	12	4					2881	2898		10.5194/essd-12-2881-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-2881-2020													WOS:000592748800005

This paper addressed the response of phytoplankton community structure to aquatic vegetation restoration after purse seine removal in Caizi Lakes. The results showed that the average dissolved oxygen (from 7.43 +/- 0.25 mg/L to 9.12 +/- 0.49 mg/L) and Secchi depth (from 28.40 +/- 6.20 cm to 47.61 +/- 14.62 cm) in the water column of the Caizi Lakes increased after the restoration of aquatic vegetation, while the average concentrations of total nitrogen (from 2.00 +/- 0.16 mg/L to 1.34 +/- 0.18 mg/L) and total phosphorus (from 0.15 +/- 0.02 mg/L to 0.06 +/- 0.01 mg/L) decreased. After the restoration of the aquatic vegetation, the cell density of phytoplankton declined from 21.04 +/- 4.57 x 10(6) cells/L to 12.74 +/- 3.63 x 10(6) cells/L, and the biomass fell from 18.13 +/- 3.57 mg/L to 9.72 +/- 2.55 mg/L. We also observed that Shannon-Wiener diversity, Margalef and Pielou indices of phytoplankton surged by 66.50%, 46.20% and 84.68%, respectively. Because this study demonstrated that aquatic vegetation could alleviate the eutrophication, it can provide guidance for the restoration and protection of the aquatic ecosystem.

Evaluating the role of sediment-bacteria interactions on Escherichia coli concentrations at beaches in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Association of bacteria with suspended sediment in the water column complicates the assessment and prediction of nearshore water quality. We examine the impact of sediment-bacteria interactions on Escherichia coli (EC) levels at beaches in southern Lake Michigan using three-dimensional EC fate and transport models with and without explicit descriptions of sediment-bacteria interactions. We simulate hydrodynamics using a nested-grid numerical model and use a semiparametric wave model to compute wave heights and net bottom shear stress. The attachment-detachment dynamics of bacteria in the water column are modeled using a linear partition coefficient. The numerical models were tested against data, collected in summer 2008, which included measurements of EC at three beaches and multiple ADCP deployments for currents and waves. Our results indicate that the model that accounts for sediment-bacteria interactions describes the observed data significantly better and that sediment, directly and indirectly, interacts with bacteria to influence their fate and transport. The improvement results from the model's ability to describe the multiple short-duration, low-intensity resuspension events at our sampling sites. A major resuspension event was noted during the simulation period but the sampling frequency during the event was inadequate to resolve the details of the peak. Using the linear isotherm model to simulate attachment-detachment dynamics of bacteria in the water column, we found that the fraction of bacteria attached to suspended sediment particles in the water column is highly variable in the vertical at offshore locations but nearly constant closer to the shore.

HICO (TM) is now collecting hyperspectral imaging data in the wavelength range of 0.4 - 1.0 micron with a spatial resolution of approximately 90 meters and a spectral resolution of 5.7 nanometers. During the construction of the HICOTM instrument, it was not possible to place a blocking filter in front of the CCD (Charge- coupled device) array located in the focal plane. As a result, the second order light from the shorter visible spectral region falls onto the detectors covering the nearIR spectral region above 0.8 micron. In order to have accurate radiometric calibrations of the near-IR channels, the second order light effects need to be removed. Through analysis of HICO (TM) imaging data containing features of shallow underwater objects, such as coral reef, we have developed a new empirical technique to correct for the second order light effects. HICO (TM) data acquired over Midway Island, Key Largo, Bahamas Bay and Philippine Sea are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique.					gao, bo/MFI-9383-2025; Li, Rongrong/B-8365-2019																978-1-4244-9566-5				2010							2303	2306		10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649184													WOS:000287933802114

Recent research revealed the importance of larval growth and survival rates in determining walleye year-class strength in western Lake Erie, indicating that spatial and temporal overlap of larvae with good habitat conditions (e.g., abundant prey, warm waters) promoted walleye growth and survival. To assess the spatial overlap between walleye larvae and habitat parameters (water depth, temperature, water clarity, prey density) in western Lake Erie, we evaluated the spatial distribution of walleye larvae and these habitat parameters with intensive sampling at 30 to 36 sites during spring 1994-1999. We analyzed spatial relationships among pelagic walleye larvae and various habitat attributes using a geographic information system and principal components analysis. Larval walleye density was consistently highest at nearshore sites during all years and showed a high degree of spatial overlap with high ichthy-oplankton density, and warm water temperatures. Larval walleye density was negatively associated with water depth and water clarity. Two principal components represented 79.6% of the total variability in site attributes. Principle components analysis supported our spatial analysis by graphically separating sites into distinct groups based on larval walleye density and habitat attributes. These analyses indicated that similar relationships between larval distribution and habitat attributes occur each year, emphasizing the importance of nearshore coastal zones as nursery areas for walleye.

The purpose of this study is to quantify the thermal sensation and air movement acceptability of occupants in an occupied space with the stratified convective-heating systems. Twenty subjects participated in eighteen trials and they were blinded to test conditions. Three air temperatures of 20.5, 21.5 and 23.0 degrees C and three local air speeds of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 m/s are chosen as the examined parameters in the warm air lake. Two shoe types of low-cut and high-top being considered for providing different protection on ankles were also used. Local and overall thermal sensation, thermal comfort and acceptability, air movement acceptability, the preference on thermal environment and air movement were collected. Perceived indoor air quality and dry eye symptoms were also acquired. Results demonstrated that subjects were sensitive to local air movement at both calves and ankles rather than the ankles only. Low air temperature ( 23.0 degrees C) and high air speed ( 0.4 m/s) in warm air lake may cause 20-65% of subjects to complain about the unacceptable air movement. High-top shoes could increase the air movement acceptability on ankles by 15% but little effects on calves were discovered. Only 7% of the subjects reported eye dryness in all tested conditions and almost all subjects could accept the indoor air quality. This work may help improve the understanding of draught sensation on lower body parts in an occupied space with the stratified convective-heating system.

In this study, two sediment cores covering the past 13.8 cal kyr BP were collected from Hani peatland in northeastern China. The organic content, carbonate content, Rb/Sr and Zr/Rb ratios were obtained to discuss the peat development process and associated environment and climate changes. The results showed that there were two deposition events in Hani peatland during 11.2-9.3 cal kyr BP and 2-1.4 cal kyr BP, when the organic content and Rb/Sr ratio decreased sharply, the carbonate content and Zr/Rb ratio increased dramatically. The synchronous occurrence of these two events and nearby volcanic eruptions, combining with tephra observed in sediments, indicated that volcanic activities have some impacts on the peat development. Except for the two events, the organic content of peat sediments increased gradually from the early to mid Holocene, and was highest at 8-6 cal kyr BP, then decreased gradually from the mid to late Holocene. The comparison with regional vegetation and paleoclimate records, together with the chemical weathering intensity obtained from the Rb/Sr, suggested that the orbital scale peat development in Hani during the Holocene was closely coupled with regional climate changes, including both temperature and precipitation. In addition, the 0.5-2 ka band filtering results of organic content showed similar oscillations with the drift ice indices of the North Atlantic Ocean and the atmospheric Delta C-14 record, implying that the North Atlantic climate and solar activities could also leave footprints on peat development of Hani on millennial timescale.					; Zhang, Wenchao/ADO-7818-2022; Heijnis, Hendrik/A-6673-2010	dodson, john/0000-0002-0124-5910; Heijnis, Hendrik/0000-0002-7601-3452; 													1367-9120	1878-5786				MAY 1	2021	210								104691	10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.104691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.104691		MAR 2021											WOS:000631893900001

The speciation of As in tailings from the Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine site in Clear Lake, California (USA) (a hot-spring Hg deposit) and particles mobilized from these tailings have. been examined during laboratory-column experiments. Solutions containing two common, plant-derived organic acids (oxalic and citric acid) were pumped at 13 pore volumes d(-1) through 25 by 500 mm columns of calcined Hg ore, analogous to the pedogenesis of tailings. Chemical analysis of column effluent indicated that all of the As mobilized was particulate (1.5 mg, or 6% of the total As in the column through 255 pore volumes of leaching). Arsenic speciation was evaluated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), indicating the dominance of arsenate [As(V)] sorbed to poorly crystalline Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides and coprecipitated with jarosite [KFe3(SO4, ASO(4))(2)(OH)(6)] with no detectable primary or secondary minerals in the tailings and mobilized particles. Sequential chemical extractions (SCE) of <45 mu m mine tailings fractions also suggest that As occurs adsorbed to Fe (hydr)oxides (35%) and coprecipitated within poorly crystalline phases (45%). In addition, SCEs suggest that As is associated with 1 N acid-soluble phases such as carbonate minerals (20%) and within crystalline Fe-(hydr)oxides (10%). The finding that As is transported from these mine tailings dominantly as As(V) adsorbed to Fe (hydr)oxides or coprecipitated within hydroxysulfates such as jarosite suggests that As release from soils and sediments contaminated with tailings will be controlled by either organic acid-promoted dissolution or reductive dissolution of host phases.

A recurrent question in ecology is the influence of environmental factors, particularly nutrients and climatic variables, on community structure and functioning, and their interaction with internal community processes (e.g. competition). 2. Perialpine lakes have been subject to two main kinds of human-induced changes over the last 50 years: eutrophication-reoligotrophication, represented by lake-specific changes in total phosphorus concentration (TP), and long-term global climatic change, captured by average winter temperature (AWT). 3. Changes in fish communities (abundance of seven species from fishery data) in 11 Perialpine lakes during 31 years (1970-2000) were investigated in relation to variation in TP and AWT using models incorporating the effects of fish maturation age, and potentially discriminating effects on adult survival and recruitment. 4. We show that phosphorus concentration affects fish abundance in species-specific ways. These effects are mediated by recruitment rather than by adult survival. Phosphorus effects are probably modulated by interspecific interactions, as increasing TP enhances total community biomass, which in turn is either positively or negatively associated with species abundance depending on species position in trophic chains. 5. Climatic change has very little effect on fish abundances, which is not consistent with the prediction of larger changes in species near their southern distribution boundary. 6. We propose several hypotheses to account for those findings, and place our study in the wider framework of community ecology.

Dead or alive: carbon as a currency to integrate disease and ecosystem ecology theory	OIKOS												Death is a common outcome of infection, but most disease models do not track hosts after death. Instead, these hosts disappear into a void. This assumption lacks critical realism, because dead hosts can alter host-pathogen dynamics. Here, we develop a theoretical framework of carbon-based models combining disease and ecosystem perspectives to investigate the consequences of feedbacks between living and dead hosts on disease dynamics and carbon cycling. Because autotrophs (i.e. plants and phytoplankton) are critical regulators of carbon cycling, we developed general model structures and parameter combinations to broadly reflect disease of autotrophic hosts across ecosystems. Analytical model solutions highlight the importance of disease-ecosystem coupling. For example, decomposition rates of dead hosts mediate pathogen spread, and carbon flux between live and dead biomass pools are sensitive to pathogen effects on host growth and death rates. Variation in dynamics arising from biologically realistic parameter combinations largely fell along a single gradient from slow to fast carbon turnover rates, and models predicted higher disease impacts in fast turnover systems (e.g. lakes and oceans) than slow turnover systems (e.g. boreal forests). Our results demonstrate that a unified framework, including the effects of pathogens on carbon cycling, provides novel hypotheses and insights at the nexus of disease and ecosystem ecology.					; Peace, Angela/AFR-4935-2022; Van de Waal, Dedmer/B-8002-2012; White, Lauren/AAB-2099-2020; Seabloom, Eric/AFT-3729-2022; Frenken, Thijs/O-1617-2014	Strauss, Alexander/0000-0003-0633-8443; White, Lauren/0000-0003-3852-5374; Peace, Angela/0000-0001-8200-8839; Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259; Everett, Rebecca/0000-0002-1565-7510; Gonzalez, Angelica L./0000-0002-4636-6329; Borer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2259-5853; ASIK, LALE/0000-0003-0803-155X; Frenken, Thijs/0000-0002-8989-2804													0030-1299	1600-0706				JUL	2023	2023	7								10.1111/oik.09880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.09880		MAY 2023											WOS:000988338800001

We have analysed the distribution of planktic and benthic foraminifera, stable isotopes and ice-rafted debris (IRD), and calculated absolute temperatures and salinities by transfer functions. During the investigated time period there was almost continuous inflow of Atlantic Water to the Nordic seas. Deposition of IRD during the mid-late Younger Dryas and Pre-Boreal coolings indicates the presence of melting icebergs and that summer sea surface temperatures were low. The east-west temperature gradient across the Faroe-Shetland Channel was much steeper than today. The cold conditions around the Faroe Islands are attributed to stronger East Greenland and East Icelandic currents than at present. The near-continuous inflow of Atlantic Water is consistent with published evidence suggesting that deep convection took place in the Nordic seas, although the convection sites probably had shifted to a more easterly position than at present. Around the time of deposition of the Saksunarvatn Tephra c. 10 350 a BP, sea surface temperatures increased to the present level. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Assessment of mercury exposure and potential effects on common loons (Gavia immer) in Quebec	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th Conference on Limnology and Water Birds	AUG 03-07, 2003	Sackville, CANADA	WG Aquat Birds				Results from recent studies report increases in mercury in the environment and increased bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. The Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) and the Canadian National Park Service initiated this study to determine whether common loons (Gavia immer) are exposed to sufficiently high mercury concentrations in prey fish to impair their reproduction and survival. Monitoring of loon reproduction, measurement of lake physicochemistry, and fish sampling for mercury analysis were conducted in various regions in Quebec, Canada, during summers from 1997 to 2002. Reproductive success was assessed and loons were captured at night and banded. Blood and feathers were collected to measure mercury. Mean blood and feather Hg concentrations in males (2.6 mu g/g w.w and 17.6 mu g/g d.w.) and females (1.8 mu g/g w.w and 8.9 mu g/g d.w.) were within the normal range of samples from north-eastern North America. However, one third (33%) of the loons sampled had mercury levels in blood or feathers exceeding the high risk levels for health and reproduction. Loons from western Quebec showed significantly lower Hg levels than those from eastern Quebec, both in blood and feathers. This study will help to determine the potential effects of mercury on the Quebec and North-American loon population and provide information to assist in decisions on pollution abatement policies.																			0018-8158					SEP	2006	567						263	274		10.1007/s10750-006-0066-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0066-7													WOS:000239147500021

The results suggested that almost 60% of these water bodies were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to atmosphere, and the collected reservoirs samples exhibited higher mean pCO(2) than lakes. The mean pCO(2) in fresh water lakes was about 3.5 times of the value in saline lakes. The lakes and reservoirs were divided into five groups (Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau region, Tibetan Plateau region, Northeastern plain and mountainous region, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region, and Eastern plain region). The Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau region showed the highest pCO(2) compared with other regions, most likely due to the typical karst landforms, karst processes may promote aqueous CO2 concentration, and karstification has a significant effect on the capture of atmospheric CO2. Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau and Tibetan Plateau region reserviors showed negative CO2 flux to atmosphere, other waters in this study all supersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. A which We analyzed the relationship between pCO(2) and environmental variables, and results showed that some indicators had correlations with pCO(2) in individual region such as total phosphorus, dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solids, but the relationship could not be observed with all surveyed waters. This indicated that it might be much more effective in a smaller regional scale than the broadened scale when the environmental factors were used as the predictor of pCO(2) in lakes. Therefore, the common algorithm that extrapolates CO2 concentration or emission flux from the study region to a wider scale might not be accurate because of the changes in the environmental and water quality conditions.

Genetic structure, diversity, and hybridization in populations of the rare arctic relict Euphrasia hudsoniana (Orobanchaceae) and its invasive congener Euphrasia stricta	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Arctic relict populations, which persist in disjunct locations far south of a species' normal range, are at the frontline of climate change and may be especially susceptible to the negative impacts of climate warming. Further, these relict populations may face increasing contact with, or become outcompeted by, invasive species if the invasive taxa are spreading along with the warming climate. Relict populations are simultaneously of particular conservation importance due to their unique genetic make-up and potential for adaptations to warmer temperatures compared to populations at the core of the species range. In this study, we used genotyping-by-sequencing to study the population genetics of Euphrasia hudsoniana, a polyploid arctic disjunct of conservation concern, at the southern edge of its range along the northwestern shore of Lake Superior. In addition, we examined evidence for hybridization with its invasive congener, E. stricta. Overall, we found clear differentiation between the native and invasive species indicated by nearly all analyses. There was limited evidence for gene flow from the invasive into the native species, but patterns were consistent with more extensive gene flow in the opposite direction. Differentiation among native populations was low, yet two of the five populations fell into a separate, distinct group based on STRUCTURE analyses. Continued genetic monitoring of these populations will help elucidate whether hybridization with invasives is a burgeoning threat for this arctic relict.																			1566-0621	1572-9737				FEB	2018	19	1					43	55		10.1007/s10592-017-0995-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-017-0995-x													WOS:000422938300004

The last glacial maximum and late glacial environmental and climate dynamics in the Baikal region inferred from an oxygen isotope record of lacustrine diatom silica	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The last glacial maximum and late glacial environmental and climatic variability in the Baikal region, southern Siberia, Russia has been studied in a sediment sequence from Lake Kotokel, located 2 km east of Lake Baikal, using the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (delta O-18(diatom)). The purification of diatom frustules involved the process of trimethylsilylation, which has been shown to be suitable for preparation of diatoms for oxygen isotope analysis. The Lake Kotokel delta O-18(diatom) record presented here spans intervals from about 24.6 to 22.9 ka BP ( further referred to as 'last glacial maximum') and similar to 16.7-11.5 ka BP ( further referred to as 'late glacial') displaying variations in the oxygen isotope composition between +26.7 and +31.2%. Overall high delta O-18(diatom) values of about +29 to +31% during the two investigated intervals characterize a strongly evaporative lake system in a dry environment and suggest a lower than present lake level due to enhanced evaporation. The Lake Kotokel diatom isotope record is roughly in line with the 60 degrees N summer solar insolation, pointing to a linkage to broader-scale climate change, but displays weaker reaction to short-term climatic oscillations, i.e. Bolling-Allerod or Younger Dryas. The climate warming at similar to 14.3 ka BP is marked by negative spikes in the delta O-18(diatom) record due to isotopically low melt water input from the mountainous hinterland.

J	DALY, SF				DALY, SF			OBSERVED ICE PASSAGE FROM LAKE HURON INTO THE ST-CLAIR RIVER	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ice entering the St. Clair River from southern Lake Huron has caused large ice jams on the river, which have inundated large inhabited areas and delayed navigation. Study and forecasting of these ice jam events require that the ice passage from the lake into the river be described quantitatively. This paper analyzes data obtained from time-lapse photography of ice conditions at the entrance of the river at Lake Huron over six winters. For each day of record when ice was observed in Lake Huron or the river, the presence or absence of an ice arch and the daily average surface concentration of ice entering the river were noted. For the months of January through April, separate means, standard deviations, and distributions of the surface ice concentration were determined for periods when the ice arch was present or absent. The existence of the ice arch can be predicted by a simple indicator based on air temperature. The statistical distributions of ice concentration are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of the ice arch. The overall mean surface ice concentration was 9.5% with an arch present and 27.3% with no arch. Based on this finding, ice passage can be forecasted.																			0380-1330						1992	18	1					61	69		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71275-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71275-1													WOS:A1992HP68100007

However, the unclear underlying mechanism challenges their application. To elucidate the effects of water parameters on OH-GDGT-derived indices and understand their environmental implications, we investigated the core OH-GDGTs of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from water columns in a year cycle and surface sediments at different water depths along a nearshore-offshore transect in Lake Fuxian, a deep and large lake in southwestern China. OH-GDGTs were primarily found in the hypolimnion and were produced in situ by Group I.1a Thaumarchaeota. The relative abundance of OH-GDGTs (%OH-GDGTs) and ring indices (RI-OH and RI-OH & PRIME;) in the hypolimnion were significantly influenced by dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH, particularly DO, which regulated the inverse physiological functions of the hydroxyl and cyclopentane moieties of archaea. %OH-GDGTs values in SPM were positively correlated with DO and negatively correlated with pH levels, while RI-OH values exhibited an inverse relationship with DO and positive correlation with pH levels. OH-GDGTs in surface sediments appeared to be homologous to that of water columns, indicating that their inferred proxies could be regulated by the configuration of water parameters. The sedimentary %OH-GDGTs values increased as the RI-OH values decreased with water depth along the transect from the lakeshore to the lake center, suggesting their potential as lake-level proxies.

Remote sensing techniques have enormous potential in monitoring coastal areas. However, one of the main tasks is accurately identifying the boundary between waterbodies such as oceans, seas, lakes or rivers, and the land surface. The aim of this research is to evaluate the accuracy of coastline extraction using different datasets. The images used come from UAV-RGB and the Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2 satellites. The method applied for extracting the coast feature involves a first phase of application of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), only for satellite data, and consequent application of the maximum likelihood classification, with automatic vectorization. To carry out a direct comparison with the extracted data, a coastline obtained through a field survey using a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) device was used. The results are very satisfactory as they meet the minimum requirements specified by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-44. Both the UAV and the Sentinel-2 reach the maximum order, called the Exclusive order (Total Horizontal Uncertainty (THU) of 5 m with a confidence level of 95%), while the Landsat-9 falls into the Special order (THU of 10 m with a confidence level of 95%).

A prospective cohort study of trends in selfpoisoning, Newcastle, Australia, 1987-2012: plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose	MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA												Objective: To examine inhospital mortality and morbidity associated with self-poisoning with different drug classes over an extended period. Design, setting and participants: A prospective cohort study over 26 years (1987-2012) with limited follow-up of patients presenting consecutively to a primary and tertiary referral toxicology centre covering Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Port Stephens, Australia. Main outcome measures: Hospital length of stay, types of drugs ingested, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, requirement for ventilation, inhospital deaths and rates of antidepressant drug use in Australia. Results: Over the study period, there were 17 266 admissions of patients poisoned by 34 342 substances (16 723 drugs available only on prescription). The median length of stay was 16 hours, 12.2% of patients (2101/17 266) were admitted to an ICU, 7.4% (1281/17 266) were ventilated and 78 (0.45%) died in hospital. Patient demographics, social and psychiatric factors remained stable over the 26-year period, but case fatality decreased (from 0.77% [15/1955] to 0.17% [7/4060]) as did ICU admissions (19.2% [376/1955] to 6.9% [280/4060]), ventilation (13.7% [268/1955] to 4.8% [193/4060]) and LOS. The most frequently ingested substances were alcohol, benzodiazepines, paracetamol, antidepressants and antipsychotics. There was a substantial fall in some highly toxic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, conventional antipsychotics and theophylline), but increases in less toxic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and paracetamol. A greater than sixfold increase in community antidepressant use was accompanied by only minor changes in overall and antidepressant selfpoisoning rates. Conclusion: Over two decades, there were decreases in poisonings by many highly toxic drugs which were associated with substantial reductions in morbidity and inhospital deaths. Despite massive increases in the number of antidepressant prescriptions, neither rates of self-harm nor the proportion of antidepressant poisonings increased markedly.

J	Sarmaja-Korjonen, K; Alhonen, P				Sarmaja-Korjonen, K; Alhonen, P			Cladoceran and diatom evidence of lake-level fluctuations from a Finnish lake and the effect of acquatic-moss layers on microfossil assemblages	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We studied Holocene lake-level fluctuations from a small lake, Iso Lehmalampi, southern Finland, utilizing cladoceran and diatom analyses. We report data from a sediment core (A) taken from the deepest part of the lake (8.1 m) where two layers of moss, mixed with gyttja, were found. These layers were formed in situ during the early Holocene (1. ca. 8100-7900, 2. ca. 7300 BP). Lake-level fluctuations were inferred also from another core C, which did not have moss layers. According to the ratio of planktonic/littoral Cladocera, the water level was high around 9000 BP and started to fall before 8000 BP. The lowering continued until 7000 BP and the moss layers were formed during this lowering. Water level was high again ca. 6000 BP and lowered towards ca. 4000 BP. The late Holocene is characterized by several rapid fluctuations of lake-level. The ratio of planktonic/littoral Cladocera and the diatom species composition in core A showed drastic changes between the moss layers and the non-moss gyttja sections of the core. We suggest that they reflect changes in sedimentary facies between the local moss environment and the pelagic bottom. Thus, cores which contain moss layers may lead to erroneous interpretations of lake-level fluctuations.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	1999	22	3					277	290		10.1023/A:1008061702639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008061702639													WOS:000083285000004

Stream, spring, and lake waters in the Lake Junin basin are all Ca2+ and HCO3- type. Evaporation has enriched the delta O-18 of the lake water by about 6% compared to that of input water. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of dissolved strontium varies from 0.70777 to 0.72242 in the watershed because of water interactions with limestone and silicate rocks, respectively, in the watershed. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of strontium in water from streams that flow through elastic sedimentary rocks east of the lake is more radiogenic (> 0.7100) than elsewhere in the watershed, where the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of surface waters range between 0.7076 and 0.7090. These lower ratios are consistent with marine limestone sources found in these watersheds. Synoptic discharge measurements, combined with the strontium isotopic data, show that that three rivers provide over 90% of the surface water to the lake: the Rio Chacachimpa, the Rio San Juan, and the Rio Palcamayo and about 60% of the total water input to the lake, the rest coming from direct precipitation.

J	MCKAYE, KR				MCKAYE, KR			FIELD OBSERVATION ON DEATH FEIGNING - A UNIQUE HUNTING BEHAVIOR BY THE PREDATORY CICHLID, HAPLOCHROMIS-LIVINGSTONI, OF LAKE MALAWI	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												H. (= Cyrtocara) Livingstoni, one of the predatory cichlids of the sand community of Lake Malawi, Africa, occurs at a density of 1.3 individuals/ha. They are territorial, defending areas 15 m wide by 40 m long along the interface of sand and Vallisneria weed beds. Individuals use a death feigning hunting pattern to capture prey. From a position of lying on their sides semiburied in the sand, these fish attack small cichlids. During 4 h of SCUBA observations 3 successful attacks from this position were seen. After an attack the small cichlids scatter and the predator moves on toward a new aggregation of fish where it again plays dead. Individuals feign death an average of 7 times/30 min watch. Death feigning behavior is initiated in 2 ways. The fish either is stationary with its ventral surface on or close to the sand and then falls onto its side, or drops from the water column into lying on side position. The initial behavioral actions of the latter method are similar to chafing behavior. But instead of chafing the sand and rising again off the bottom, the fish plows into the sand and remains immobile. These data further add to the evidence that cichlids are remarkably flexible in their feeding behavior.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1981	6	3-4					361	365		10.1007/BF00005766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005766													WOS:A1981MU01000012

Angler exploitation of an unexploited walleye population in the northern Great Plains	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Walleyes Sander vitreus are an important sport fish found throughout the northern Great Plains of North America. Periods of increased precipitation across the Great Plains can result in new or expanded lakes that contain unexploited fish populations. We assessed angler exploitation of a previously unexploited walleye population to estimate exploitation rates, subsequent changes in walleye abundance, and changes in angler behavior. This research provides an opportunity to add to the limited body of information concerning walleye exploitation and exploitation of unexploited populations. Hazeldon Lake, South Dakota contained an unexploited walleye population and was opened to angling on 15 July 2006. Initial exploitation was high, estimates exceeded 16% after two days and 75% after 16 days. Anglers harvested an estimated 6868 walleyes during 15 July - 31 August 2006; this harvest represented 79% of the pre-opener population estimate of 8661. The 2007 spring population estimate was 2436 fish and represented a 72% decline from the 2006 estimate. Gill net catch per unit effort (CPUE) averaged 30.0 fish net(-1) prior to fishing in 2006; the 2007 CPUE was 76% lower at 7.2 fish net(-1). A lack of recruitment resulted in no substantial increases in relative abundance from 2007-2017. Fishing pressure was high when the lake first opened to fishing. However, the number of anglers and exploitation rates declined once walleye catch and harvest rates dropped off. Our results suggest that walleye populations in new or expanded waters located in the northern Great Plains can be extremely vulnerable to angling but when catch rates drop off few anglers will continue to fish a given water; instead moving to other waters potentially having higher walleye catch rates.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				AUG	2019	216						59	64		10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.026													WOS:000472698100007

The experimental design included replicated controls and the following treatments added at 2-to 3-day intervals: phosphate (PHOS), kaolinite (KAOL), montmorillonite (MONT), kaolinite with phosphate (K + P), and montmorillonite with phosphate (M + P). Periphyton were sampled from polyethylene strips of the same material as the enclosure walls, suspended at depths of 0.5 m and 2.0 m to assess treatment effects on shallow (epilimnetic) vs. deep (hypolimnetic) communities. Colonization after 40 days was sparse, dominated in biovolume by blue-green algae in all but the epilimnion of controls, in which small gelatinous green algae and chrysophyte flagellates were abundant. The biovolume of shallow periphyton after 79 days was lowest in KAOL and MONT, intermediate in controls and PHOS, and greatest in clay + P. Hence, P enrichment alleviated the deleterious effects of clay on periphyton production, and clay + P appeared to act synergistically in stimulating benthic algal growth. Periphyton biovolume was comparable among shallow and deep controls, PHOS, and treatments with the rapidly settling kaolinite. Lowest biovolume occurred at depth in treatments with montmorillonite under extreme light attenuation imposed by the suspended, finely particulate clay. The relative contribution of blue-green algae to total periphyton production was highest in clay + P treatments and lowest in controls. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates increased in the shallow periphyton under clay loading, and in the deep communities under PHOS and M + P. Periphyton contributed only 20-32% of total mesocosm productivity in controls, PHOS, and KAOL, increasing to about 40% in MONT, and to 72-91% of the total in M + P and K + P. The data indicate that benthic microalgae can represent a major proportion of the primary production in shallow reservoirs under high phosphate and sediment loading.																			0022-3646					JUN	1991	27	3					373	384		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1991.00373.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1991.00373.x													WOS:A1991FR23900008
J	Dyk, DW; Miller, KM				Dyk, David W.; Miller, Kevin M.			Mechanical model of human eye compliance for volumetric occlusion break surge measurements	JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY												Purpose: To develop a mechanical model of human eye compliance for volumetric studies. Setting: Alcon Research, Ltd., Lake Forest, California, USA. Design: Experimental study. Methods: Enucleated human eyes underwent pressurization and depressurization cycles with peak intraocular pressures (IOPs) of 60 to 100 mm Hg; anterior chamber pressure and volume changes were measured. Average net volume change curves were calculated as a function of IOP for each eye. Overall mean volumes were computed from each eye's average results at pressure points extrapolated over the range of 5 to 90 mm Hg. A 2-term exponential function was fit to these results. A fluid chamber with a displaceable piston was created as a mechanical model of this equation. A laser confocal displacement meter was used to measure piston displacement. A test bed incorporated the mechanical model with a mounted phacoemulsification probe and allowed for simulated occlusion breaks. Surge volume was calculated from piston displacement. Results: An exponential function, V = C-1 x exp(C-2 x IOP) + C-3 x exp(C-4 x IOP) - V-0, where V, the volume, was fit to the final depressurization curve obtained from 15 enucleated human eyes. The C1 through C4 values were -0.07141, -0.23055, -0.14972, and -0.02006, respectively. The equation was modeled using a piston system with 3 parallel springs that engaged serially. The mechanical model mimicked depressurization curves observed in human cadaver eyes. Conclusion: The resulting mechanical compliance model measured ocular volumetric changes and thus would be helpful in characterizing the postocclusion break surge response.

Loktak Lake is a huge reservoir for various kinds of organisms, including cyanobacteria. The present study describes the isolation and molecular diversity of 72 filamentous, heterocystous cyanobacterial strains isolated from samples collected from Loktak Lake, its adjoining rice fields and rice fields in Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) complex, Shillong, Meghalaya, India. The isolated strains belonged to the genera Anabaena, Nostoc, Calothrix, Cylindrospermum and Mastigocladus. The molecular analysis of isolates revealed the occurrence of certain strains being present in the sample collected from the rice fields falling in the catchment area of Loktak Lake, Manipur and rice fields in ICAR complex, Shillong, Meghalaya both. A polyphasic approach based on morphological features and PCR based molecular polymorphism revealed enormous level of molecular diversity. Out of three primers targeted regions used for determining genetic polymorphism, STRR1A produced best fingerprint profile of cyanobacterial strains. The morphological diversity of isolates was assured by light microscope whereas PCR based multiple fingerprint profile was used for molecular characterization. Molecular typing using short tandemly repeated repetitive STRR1A sequences as primer provided strain specific fingerprint profiles of the isolates.

This period was chosen, because in this period the recreation load on the Baikal coast is the highest and the summer peak in development of the water biota is observed. The route included ten stations with a priori different anthropogenic load. At each station, the content of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere and dissolved in water, as well as their fluxes in the water-atmosphere system, were measured. Here, samples of surface and bottom water were taken, in which the pH value, the concentration of dissolved oxygen, bicarbonate, nitrate, phosphate and fluorescence characteristics were determined. It is shown that the minimum concentrations of nutrients were recorded at the Boyarskii village. The strongest water pollution was found near the coast of Novyi Enkhaluk village. Particularly this part of the coast is subjected to the highest anthropogenic impact from tourist complexes located along this coast line.

Subfossil Cladocera, together with diatom, pollen and geochemical records, were used to examine climate-induced changes in lake ecosystem since the Last Glacial Maximum (30 000-0 cal year BP). Consistency among these biological records indicates that the succession of zooplankton, algae and vegetation changed in response to direct and indirect climatic factors. Alterations in the nutrient supply mediated by climate-induced changes in vegetation and soil processes are likely responsible for the variability of cladocerans. During the Last Glacial Maximum, cladocerans were dominated by littoral taxa (e.g. Alona), indicating an unproductive and oligotrophic lake system. A peak distribution in the pelagic Bosmina highlights the period of increased nutrient availability at 11 500 cal year BP. The ecological changes in Cladocera at 19 000 cal year BP and diatom communities at 18 000 cal year BP reveal independent and indirect responses to nutrient and light conditions induced by solar radiation and increased monsoon intensity across the study region. The palaeoecological archives from Lake Lugu sediments highlight a complex lake ecosystem influenced by both direct and indirect changes corresponding to climate changes and shifts in regional anthropogenic pressure over the last 30 000 years.					; Kattel, Giri/AAV-3298-2020	Wang, Qian/0000-0002-7562-258X; Kattel, Giri/0000-0002-8348-6477													0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	2019	41	5					771	785		10.1093/plankt/fbz049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbz049													WOS:000509465800014

Comparison of the delta(18)O(P) history with a pollen-based palaeotemperature record from the same core clearly reveals pronounced deviations from the normally expected temporal delta(18)O(P)-temperature relation (so-called 'Dansgaard relation') that may be a function of changing oceanicity. The transition from relatively moist, maritime conditions in the early Holocene to a much drier climate after 6500 cal. BP is reflected by major changes in forest extent and composition as recorded by pollen and plant macrofossil data. At the time of maximum influence of westerly air-mass circulation (high zonal index) c. 9500 cal. BP, brought about by high summer insolation and enhanced meridional pressure gradients. delta(18)O(P) at Lake Tibetanus was about 2%, higher than would be predicted by the modem isotope-temperature relation, The occurrence of long-term changes in delta(18)O(P)-temperature relations, which are more sensitive measures of palaeoclimate than either delta(18)O(P) or temperature alone, needs to be taken into account when extracting palaeoclimatic information from continental oxygen-isotope records.					; Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008; Birks, H.

J	HORPPILA, J				HORPPILA, J			THE DIET AND GROWTH OF ROACH (RUTILUS-RUTILUS (L)) IN LAKE VESIJARVI AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE COURSE OF BIOMANIPULATION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Previous studies have suggested that the roach Rutilus rutilus (L.) stock of Lake Vesijarvi is one of the main factors delaying the recovery of the lake after sewage diversion. This study is concerned with the documentation of the diet of roach in the lake. In total, 531 roach were examined. Both in the pelagial and in the littoral the roach had mixed diets in May and in September-October. The importance of zooplankton decreased and the importance of benthos and plants increased with increasing size of roach. In July, in the pelagic zone all sizes of roach fed exclusively on zooplankton (Bosmina spp.), while in the littoral zooplankton had the highest volume proportions only in the smallest (< 130 mm) roach. The frequent use of plant food and slow growth rate of large roach indicate a low availability of animal prey. As the fish densities decrease due to the mass removal taking place in the lake, the percentage of plant food in the diets of roach will probably decrease and the growth of roach will increase. Additionally, the tendency of the roach to migrate into the pelagic zone in early summer may be reduced, which would decrease their predation on the zooplankton.																			0018-8158					DEC 2	1994	294	1					35	41		10.1007/BF00017623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017623													WOS:A1994QG90300006

We use sedimentological and geochemical proxies (e.g. lithology, gain size, loss-on-ignition, soluble salts, X-ray fluorescence elements) from Balikun Lake in the eastern Tienshan Mountains, to elucidate variations in sedimentation, water chemistry and watershed weathering intensity of the Late Pleistocene interval (similar to 20-60 ka). The record documents high-frequency oscillations and alternating hydrological patterns on (multi-) millennial timescales. Balikun Lake changes from nearly fresh to brackish and finally to hypersaline conditions during MIS3. The warm and wet climate during the early MIS3 facilitated regional vegetation and bioproductivity. Halite sedimentation took place from the middle to late MIS3, indicating a gradual drying trend. This reduced the lake area and vegetation cover, as well as weakened the chemical weathering rates of the watershed. These new interpretations challenge the idea of climate amelioration with the highest lake level and wettest conditions prevailing in the arid areas of north-west China during the late MIS3, indicating a possible westerlies-dominated Late Pleistocene climate in these areas. The evolution of the palaeohydrological regime and climate change in the Balikun Basin correlated well with the millennial-scale high-latitude Atlantic climate superimposed on the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.

In the fall of 2011, a large wildfire occurred in northern Minnesota and we were able to quickly access the area to sample the forest floor and mineral soil for C, N, and Hg pools. When compared with unburned reference soils, the mean loss of C resulting from fire in the forest floor and the upper 20 cm of mineral soil was 19.3 Mg ha(-1), for N the mean loss was 0.17 Mg ha(-1), and for Hg the mean loss was 9.3 g ha(-1). To assess the influence of fire severity on the forest floor and mineral soils, we used an established method that included a soil burn severity index and a tree burn severity index with a gradient of severity classes. It was apparent that the unburned reference class had greater forest floor C, N, and Hg pools and higher C/N ratios than the burned classes. The C/N ratios of the 0- to 10- and 10- to 20-cm mineral soils in the unburned reference class were also greater than in the burned classes, indicating that a small amount of C was lost and/or N was gained, potentially through leaching unburned forest floor material. However, with a couple of exceptions, the severity classes were unable to differentiate the forest floor and mineral soil impacts among soil burn and tree burn severity indices. Developing burn severity indices that are reflective of soil elemental impacts is an important first step in scaling ecosystem impacts both within and across fire events.

The method was applied to an eutrophicated shallow coastal bay in western Japan, where the occurrence of red tides at the water surface and the onset of bottom hypoxic waters are observed every summer. Both meteorology and freshwater inflow contribute to the development of stratification of the bay, thus limiting the dissolved oxygen supply to bottom waters. The resulting hydrodynamics enhances the development of oxygen-depleted bottom waters by transporting organic matter produced by algal blooms to the inner bay, where it decomposes and exerts high SOD. During August, about 60% of the inner bay is hypoxic for prolonged durations and as a result most of the benthic biota and fish die. The method used here is a very useful and informative way to evaluate the spatial and temporal damage and severity caused by hypoxia on living resources. Moreover, the model results agreed very well with the observed hydrodynamics, thermal structure and water quality data of the stratified bay. The model can be used for other lakes and bays where knowledge of temperature and density stratification is important for assessing water quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Features of Plankton Metabolism: Results of Automated Measurements in the Mozhaisk Reservoir	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The plankton metabolism determines fluctuations in the oxygen concentrations of a water body, its ecological condition, and the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere. We used an automated device that allowed us to make mass measurements of intraday values of the gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) of plankton. During our studies of the Mozhaisk Reservoir (Russia) in the summer of 2017, we established an important fact: the maximum values of GPP were observed essentially earlier in the daytime than those of R. This is explained by the fact that GPP is related to solar radiation (the maximum values are observed at noon), whereas R is related to the temperature of water, which reaches its maximum several hours after in the afternoon. As a result, the maximum value of dissolved oxygen was observed in the second half of the day, when GPP and R become even. The device we have designed may be used for continuously monitoring the metabolism of plankton and its responses to various hydrometeorological, hydrochemical, and anthropogenic impacts.

These organisms are predicted to be fermentative heterotrophs contributing to carbon cycling in sediment ecosystems. Here, we double the genomic catalogue of Asgardarchaeota by obtaining 71 MAGs from a range of habitats around the globe, including the deep subsurface, brackish shallow lakes, and geothermal spring sediments. Phylogenomic inferences followed by taxonomic rank normalisation confirmed previously established Asgardarchaeota classes and revealed four additional lineages, two of which were consistently recovered as monophyletic classes. We therefore propose the names Candidatus Sifarchaeia class nov. and Ca. Jordarchaeia class nov., derived from the gods Sif and Jord in Norse mythology. Metabolic inference suggests that both classes represent hetero-organotrophic acetogens, which also have the ability to utilise methyl groups such as methylated amines, with acetate as the probable end product in remnants of a methanogen-derived core metabolism. This inferred mode of energy conservation is predicted to be enhanced by genetic code expansions, i.e., stop codon recoding, allowing the incorporation of the rare 21st and 22nd amino acids selenocysteine (Sec) and pyrrolysine (Pyl). We found Sec recoding in Jordarchaeia and all other Asgardarchaeota classes, which likely benefit from increased catalytic activities of Sec-containing enzymes. Pyl recoding, on the other hand, is restricted to Sifarchaeia in the Asgardarchaeota, making it the first reported non-methanogenic archaeal lineage with an inferred complete Pyl machinery, likely providing members of this class with an efficient mechanism for methylamine utilisation. Furthermore, we identified enzymes for the biosynthesis of ester-type lipids, characteristic of bacteria and eukaryotes, in both newly described classes, supporting the hypothesis that mixed ether-ester lipids are a shared feature among Asgardarchaeota.

A sediment core from Kukkal Lake preserves a continuous sediment record from the early-Holocene to present (9000 yr BP to present). The present lake is situated at an elevation of similar to 1887m a.s.l., in a small basin that appears to have alternated between a and wetland depositional environment. Climate proxies, including sediment texture, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N, pollen and geochemical composition indicate a steady progression to wetter conditions, with two stepwise changes at about 8000, and between 3200 and 1800 yr BP. The change at 8000 yr BP appears to correspond to a brief (100-150years) dry spell recorded elsewhere in India. The change at 3200-1800 yr BP consisted in a rapid intensification of the SWM, and may correlate with the initiation of the Roman Warm Period'. There is no clear evidence of changes at the times of the Medieval Warm Period' (MWP') and the Little Ice Age' (LIA'). The C/N ratio of the sediments ranges from 14.02 to 8.31, indicating that the organic matter originated from a mixture of lacustrine algae, vascular and terrestrial plants. Chemical weathering indices (Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW), and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA)) are consistent with extreme silicate weathering. Pollen data show a development from savanna vegetation prior to about 8000 yr BP, followed by grassland with palms, the appearance of ferns just prior to 3200 yr BP and the establishment of the tropical humid forest between 3200 and about 1800 yr BP.					; Achyuthan, Hema/AAA-6898-2022	Achyuthan, Hema/0000-0001-5495-4115; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2017	27	3					404	417		10.1177/0959683616660162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616660162													WOS:000395385500008

Samples were taken from 11 sites along a 50 km transect extending from the lower reaches of the Sandusky River, through Sandusky Bay and into the western basin of Lake Erie to identify factors correlated with identifiable patterns in distribution and abundance of summer phytoplankton. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), an ordination technique used to describe pat terns in complex data sets, arranged the sample sites along an ordination axis that explained 76% of the variation in the phytoplankton abundance data matrix, and produced the following sequence of ordination axis scores: Sandusky Bay-->Lake Erie-->Sandusky River. DCA axis I scores strongly correlated with total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, algal phosphatase activity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, and alkalinity, but not chloride concentration, suggesting that phytoplankton abundance and distribution were related to phosphorus availability and not simply due to the passive movement of water along the transect. Bacterial abundance correlated with DCA axis I, suggesting that phytoplankton-bacterial interactions may be important in understanding distributional patterns of Sandusky Bay phytoplankton.					; Hwang, Sunjin/AAK-7149-2020	Hwang, Soon-Jin/0000-0001-7083-5036; 													0380-1330						1996	22	4					818	829		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)71003-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)71003-1													WOS:A1996WD85300004
J	Stigebrandt, A				Stigebrandt, Anders			On the response of the Baltic proper to changes of the total phosphorus supply	AMBIO												Using a time-dependent phosphorus (P) budget model for the Baltic proper, describing sources and sinks at the external borders of the water column, one may compute the e-folding time T of the adjustment of the winter surface water P concentration c (1) to abruptly changed total P supply. The restoration time TR = 3T is introduced as a practical measure of the time it takes to achieve 95% of the change of c (1) towards the final, equilibrium, state c (1e). The P budget model, including an internal source emanating from deep anoxic bottoms, also shows that c (1e) is proportional to the total P supply to the water column. About 70% of present time total P supply to the Baltic proper comes from deep anoxic bottoms. If deep bottoms were kept oxygenated, this internal P supply would be turned off and the equilibrium concentration c(1e) would be reduced by about 70%. This should imply that the Baltic proper may be restored to a state determined by the external P supplies from land-based and oceanic sources. According to the model, restoration would take 10-15 years. Thereafter most of the equipment used for oxygenation may be shut off since also the deepwater oxygen demand by decomposition of fresh organic matter, would have decreased by about 70% implying that the deepwater would be kept oxic by the natural vertical circulation. The model presented in this paper provides a new science-based solution of the eutrophication problem of the Baltic proper, which is of great interest from a management point of view.

J	Gullbrandsson, R				Gullbrandsson, Robin			Dendrochronological investigation of Kumlaby Church on Visingso	FORNVANNEN-JOURNAL OF SWEDISH ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH												Kumlaby is a well-preserved Romanesque apse church on the island of Visingso in Lake Vattern. In 2016 structural timbers inside the church were sampled for dendro-chronology. The nave and chancel have well-preserved roof trusses of pine wood, consisting of tie beam, rafters, two canted struts, collar beam and steering plates. On the exteriors of the chancel's wall plates, relief decoration survives. The tie beams in the south-west corner of the chancel bear traces of the mounting of two liturgical bells. These traces, the decorated steering plates and the finely hewn tie beams makes it clear that the roof trusses were originally visible from below. Nail holes in the bottom surfaces of the tie beams show that a ceiling was added sometime before the Late Medieval vaulting was put in. With an estimation of lost sapwood, it can be concluded that the pines were felled sometime in the span 1142-72, most probably 1145-55. These trees grew in Vastergotland. The roof trusses can be regarded as original structures and should have been erected more or less in one phase. One of the tie beams in the tower could be dated to the winter 1274/75, thus dating the completion of the tower. These pines were felled in Ostergotland. The beams of the lower storeys match in time with the tie beam, thus making it clear that the tower was erected in a single phase.																			0015-7813	1404-9430					2017	112	2					80	87																WOS:000424728900002
J	Heidtke, T; Hartig, JH; Zarull, MA; Yu, BN				Heidtke, T; Hartig, JH; Zarull, MA; Yu, BN			PCB levels and trends within the detroit river-western lake erie basin: A historical perspective of ecosystem monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An international workshop held in the spring of 2002 convened a group of technical experts to address monitoring, modeling, and management of PCBs within the Detroit River-Western Lake Erie basin. Participants shared and discussed a diverse set of research data bases pertaining to PCB levels within the region, discussed observed changes within different components of the local ecosystem, and identified several primary issues impacting future PCB management strategies. Results presented at the workshop indicate dramatic reductions in PCB contamination levels have been observed in much of study area between the late 1970s and mid-1990s. Estimates of loadings attributable to water and atmospheric sources have generally declined, as have PCB concentrations in herring gull eggs, smelt and walleye. Nevertheless, additional improvements have not been observed during recent years and elevated contamination levels remain a concern within local hot spots, particularly in the lower Detroit River and Trenton Channel. A primary recommendation broadly supported by workshop participants is the need to maintain, support, and coordinate a comprehensive ecosystem monitoring program for the Detroit River-Western Lake Erie basin, one that incorporates both near-field and far-field monitoring elements. Such a program is crucial to provide necessary data in support of understanding ecosystem trends, calculating annual mass loadings to the system, assessing impacts of remediation actions, developing improved modeling frameworks, and formulating cost-effective management strategies for the future.

Strikingly, some H6 subtype viruses can infect pigs, dogs, and humans, posing risks to public health. In this study, 9 H6N2 viruses recovered from waterfowl species in the Guangdong province of China in 2018 were isolated and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the genome sequences of these H6N2 viruses belonged to Group I, except for the NP gene in Group III. Coalescent analyses demonstrated that the reassortment of NA and NS genes have occurred in two independent clusters, suggesting H6 subtype viruses had been undergoing a complex reassortant. To examine the evolutionary dynamics and the dissemination of the H6 subtype viruses, a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection was performed for results showing higher viral migration rates between closer provinces, including Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Fujian. Notably, the transmission routes of the H6 subtype viruses were concentrated in Jiangxi Province, the most frequent location for input and output transmission and a region containing Poyang Lake, a well-known wintering site for migration birds. We also found that the aquatic birds, especially ducks, were the most common input source of the viral transmission. In addition, we also found that eight positively selected amino acid sites were identified in HA protein. Given their continuous dissemination and the broad prevalence of the H6 subtype influenza viruses, continued surveillance is warranted in the future.					; Jiang, Danli/JWA-4057-2024	Zhang, Jiahao/0000-0002-8780-1497; 														1999-4915				JUN	2022	14	6							1154	10.3390/v14061154	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v14061154								35746626					WOS:000816306800001

No submerged macrophytes were present in the lake from 1981-1986, during which time the summer mean Secchi depth ranged from 0.6 and 0.8 m. From 1987 to 1990, Secchi depth increased from 0.9 m to 1.8 m and macrophyte coverage consequently increased (1 % of the lake area in 1987, 2 % in 1988, 50 % in 1989, 80 % in 1990 and 90 % in 199 1). At the same time, the macrophytes became taller, and the weedbeds more dense. The macrophytes colonized from the exposed and deeper part of the lake towards the sheltered and more shallow part of the lake, a colonization pattern that was confirmed by transplantation experiments. The delay in colonization of the shallow parts may be caused by waterfowl grazing. The vegetation was initially dominated by Potamogeton crispus L., but there was a gradual change during 1988-1989 and Elodea canadensis Michx became exclusively dominant in 1990-1991.

The aridity index is used to measure terrestrial mois-ture, which combines the effects of both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), with the latter representing the amount of water consumed by the atmosphere. The results show that relative to the preindustrial period, the total dry -land area in China varies by -15%, 6%, and -13% during the LIG, LGM, and MH, respectively, and slightly varies in the three future scenarios. Over China, LGM dryland expansion and future dryland contraction are mainly attributed to pre-cipitation changes, MH dryland contraction is mainly caused by PET changes, and LIG dryland contraction is comparably caused by PET and precipitation changes. For the LGM and three future scenarios, temperature is the leading factor of PET changes, while during the MH and LIG, the change in relative humidity is the main factor. In comparison, the simu-lated aridity changes in China are generally consistent with the reconstructed moisture changes for the three past periods, although uncertainties exist in reconstructions during the LGM and MH.

Concentrations of seven carbonyl species in bulk cloudwater samples were measured with concurrent gas phase HCHO measurements. In the cloudwater, the most abundant carbonyl was HCHO with a median value of 11.9 mu mol L-1, followed by acetaldehyde (4.3 mu mol L-1), acetone (1.9 mu mol L-1), pentanal (1.4 mu mol L-1), benzaldehyde (0.5 mu mol L-1), butanal (0.4 mu mol L-1), and propanal (0.2 mu mol L-1). The relative abundance of propanal to acetaldehyde in the cloudwater was substantially lower than estimates from primary emissions. The cloudwater abundance of HCHO relative to the sum of the other carbonyls was found to increase with altitude in the clouds that penetrated the boundary layer. During most flights, the total in-cloud HCHOt (cloudwater + interstitial gas phase) was similar to cloud base HCHOg, suggesting that HCHO was distributed between the two phases through partitioning governed by Henry's law. However, during at least one flight, HCHOt was significantly depleted in the cloud. Finally, the equilibrium gas phase mixing ratios predicted from the cloudwater for all carbonyls but HCHO were much higher than previously measured in the gas phase.					; wang, dk/GXG-9446-2022	Leithead, Amy/0000-0002-2860-0468; Leaitch, Warren Richard/0000-0003-1503-5639; Li, Shao-Meng/0000-0002-7628-6581													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 10	2008	113	D17							D17206	10.1029/2007JD009364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JD009364													WOS:000259200400003

An expert group, under the guidance of RAV, has now revised the text again. Since the publication of the previous treatment recommendations, I new drug for the treatment of HIV has been approved - the protease inhibitor (PI) clarunavir (Prezista (R)). Furthermore, 3 new drugs have become available: the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (MK-0518), the CCR5-inhibitor maraviroc (Celsentri (R)), both of which have novel mechanisms of action, and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine (TMC-125). The new guidelines differ from the previous ones in several respects. The most important of these are that abacavir is now preferred to tenofovir and zidovudine, as a first line drug in treatment-naive patients, and that initiation of antiretroviral treatment is now recommended before the CD4 cell count falls below 250/mu l, rather than 200/mu l. Furthermore, recommendations on the treatment of HIV infection in children have been added to the document. As in the case of the previous publication, recommendations are evidence-graded in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, 2001 (see http://www.cebm.net/levels-of evidence. asp#levels).					; Gisslen, Magnus/D-7454-2015; Navér, Lars/E-5085-2013; Sönnerborg, Anders/W-2011-2019	Sonnerborg, Anders/0000-0001-8928-3374; Gisslen, Magnus/0000-0002-2357-1020; Naver, Lars/0000-0001-6027-0211; 													0036-5548	1651-1980					2007	39	6-7					486	507		10.1080/00365540701383154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00365540701383154								17577810					WOS:000248339200001

Trophic ecology of the North American crayfish genus Barbicambarus Hobbs, 1969 (Decapoda: Astacoidea: Cambaridae): evidence for a unique relationship between body size and trophic position	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Knowledge regarding the trophic ecology of a species is invaluable in conservation planning. Trophic ecology of crayfishes, however, is largely generalized across taxa, with a significant lack of species-specific data. Two such data deficient species are the bottlebrush crayfishes, Barbicambarus cornutus (Faxon, 1884), and the Tennessee bottlebrush crayfish, Barbicambarus simmonsi Taylor & Schuster, 2010. To obtain data on the trophic position of these species, we collected specimens of the two sympatric species and representative food groups in the Green River system in Kentucky, USA and the Shoal Creek drainage in Tennessee and Alabama, USA during the summer of 2013. We aimed to analyze the trophic position and diet of both species through stable isotope and gut content analyses. Our work indicates that the two species of Barbicambarus occupy a higher trophic position than other sympatric species of crayfishes, possibly occupying a higher-level functional role as predator within their respective systems. Gut content analyses showed no clear evidence of a higher-level predator diet, but did include tissues of animals at a higher trophic level. The stable isotope analysis showed a significant increase in trophic level with increasing size, a pattern not seen in any other species in this study. These results indicate Barbicambarus species have a trophic ecology that differs from those reported in the literature for other crayfish species.																			0278-0372	1937-240X				MAY	2017	37	3					263	271		10.1093/jcbiol/rux019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jcbiol/rux019													WOS:000403004500005
J	Gevao, B; Hamilton-Taylor, J; Jones, KC				Gevao, B; Hamilton-Taylor, J; Jones, KC			Polychlorinated biphenyl and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon deposition to and exchange at the air-water interface of Esthwaite water, a small lake in Cumbria, UK	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Atmospheric concentrations and deposition fluxes of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured concurrently over a 1-year period at a shore-based site at Esthwaite Water, to estimate their loadings from the atmosphere to the lake water surface. The PAH deposition fluxes (mu g m(-2) month(-1)) to conventional upturned Frisbees varied from 0.19 (anthracene) to 7.8 (phenanthrene), with a Sigma PAH deposition of 33.5. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene contributed > 50% of the Sigma PAH deposited. The deposition fluxes of PCBs ranged from 0.03 (octa-PCBs) to 0.38 (tri-PCBs) mu g m(-2) month(-1) with a Sigma PCB Aux estimated at 0.87 mu g m(-2) month(-1). The coefficients of variation of deposition varied from 75% (octa-PCBs) to 120% (tri-PCBs) and from 90 to 150% for individual PAHs. Temporal variability in fluxes to the collector was large, suggesting highly variable atmospheric concentrations and scavenging processes. Atmospheric PAH concentrations were negatively correlated with temperature over the sampling period, suggesting that the source function-rather than temperature-dependent, air-surface equilibrium partitioning-primarily controlled air concentrations. Deposition fluxes of PAHs correlated well with rainfall between January and September, suggesting that particle washout was the main factor controlling deposition over this period. The controlling factor for deposition between October and December was related to the increased source function of the compounds to the atmosphere. Regression analysis of the data for PAHs with greater than or equal to 4 rings gave a strong positive correlation between the deposition flux and atmospheric concentrations, suggesting that the transfer of compounds occurred with a similar efficiency. Simultaneous air and water sampling over an annual cycle was used to calculate fugacity quotients for individual PAHs and PCBs. These calculations showed that PCBs were outgassing from the lake water throughout the year (i.e. volatilisation > deposition) whilst PAH transfers varied seasonally with net deposition in winter months when there is no ice cover, and net volatilisation at all other times.

Comparing rivers to lakes: Implications for drowning prevention	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH												Objective To contrast unintentional fatal drowning in rivers with lakes to determine appropriateness for application of existing river drowning prevention strategies. Design A total population retrospective cross-sectional analysis using coronial data. Setting Australia, 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2018. Participants Children and adults (n = 342) who died from unintentional drowning in a river or lake. Main outcome measures Incidence, crude fatality rates, relative risk (95% confidence interval) and chi-square tests of independence for risk factors for unintentional fatal drowning. Subset analysis of land management for lake drowning locations. Results Four-fifths (82%) occurred in rivers. Lake drowning was more likely among 0- to 17-year-olds, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and when swimming or using watercraft. River drowning most commonly occurred following a fall into water and with alcohol involvement. Drowning risk in very remote areas was elevated for both lakes (relative risk = 18.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.61-209.44) and rivers (relative risk = 15.89; 95% confidence interval: 5.56-45.37) compared to major cities. Those responsible for land and water management at lakes were primarily local government (59%), water authorities (32%) and parks and wildlife authorities (7%). Conclusions In contrast to a focus on adults and alcohol in existing river drowning prevention strategies, lake interventions must target children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and recreational lake users. Fatal drowning rates are high for remote rivers and lakes, necessitating focused effort. There are opportunities to embed drowning prevention strategies within land and water management plans. Lake drowning prevention requires broader engagement with land and water managers and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.					; Franklin, Richard/H-1731-2012; Peden, Amy/AAO-5342-2020	Peden, Amy/0000-0002-6424-1511; Franklin, Richard/0000-0003-1864-4552; Scarr, Justin-Paul/0000-0002-6547-0703; 													1038-5282	1440-1584				DEC	2020	28	6					568	578		10.1111/ajr.12679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.12679		NOV 2020						33231359					WOS:000591693300001

Subsequently, the role played by FA signature in these two highly demanding stages of life cycle was inferred. The results confirm that muscle represents an important fat reservoir, and the FA trophic markers revealed the importance of bacteria as sources of iso and anteiso FA and the strong trophic representation of benthic phytoplankton (diatoms) to larvae muscle FA profile. In early spawning migrants, the significance of marine food web to FA muscle profile is highlighted by the presence of FA signatures characteristics of herbivorous calanoid copepods. Although both life cycle phases studied do not share the same muscle FA signature, there is a part of the profile that is common, which is characterized by FA used in beta-oxidation, such as C18:1 omega 9 but also by medium chain FA and PUFA which points that PUFA are spared as fuel to beta-oxidation process and probably used to the development of tissues membranes (ammocoetes) and gonadal development and eicosanoid production among others (early spawning migrants). Further studies on FA profile are necessary to elucidate the FA role either during different life stages (ontogeny) or in the distinct habitats frequented (freshwater versus marine) by this diadromous species.

Urea Release by Intermittently Saturated Sediments from a Coastal Agricultural Landscape	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Urea-N is linked to harmful algal blooms in lakes and estuaries, and urea-N-based fertilizers have been implicated as a source. However, the export of urea-N-based fertilizers appears unlikely, as high concentrations of urea-N are most commonly found in surface waters outside periods of fertilization. To evaluate possible autochthonous production of urea-N, we monitored urea-N released from drainage ditch sediments using mesocosms. Sediments from a cleaned (recently dredged) drainage ditch, uncleaned ditch, forested ditch, riparian wetland, and an autoclaved sand control were isolated in mesocosms and flooded for 72 h to quantify urea-N, NH4+-N, and NO3--N in the floodwater. Sediments were flooded with different N-amended solutions (distilled H2O, 1.5 mg L-1 NH4+-N, 3.0 mg L-1 NH4+-N, 2.6 mg L-1 NO3--N, or 5.1 mg L-1 NO3--N) and incubated at three water temperatures (16, 21, and 27 degrees C). Urea-N concentrations in mesocosms representing uncleaned and cleaned drainage ditches were significantly greater than nonagricultural sediments and controls. While flooding sediments with N-enriched solution had no clear effect on urea-N, warmer (27 degrees C) temperatures resulted in significantly higher urea-N. Data collected from field ditches that were flooded by a summer rainstorm showed increases in urea-N that mirrored the mesocosm experiment. We postulate that concentrations of urea-N in ditches that greatly exceed environmental thresholds are mediated by biological production in sediments and release to stagnant surface water. Storm-driven urea-N export from ditches could elevate the risk of harmful algal blooms downstream in receiving waters despite the dilution effect.					; Buda, Anthony/ABA-3525-2021; King, Mason/HLQ-7631-2023	King, Mason/0000-0003-0729-9773; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					302	310		10.2134/jeq2016.08.0304	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2016.08.0304								28380555					WOS:000397864700009

Continuous data (1 July 2005-30 June 2006) from 90 sites throughout the Great Lakes Basin (GLB) were used to classify and model the thermal regimes of streams in Ontario. Existing and newly developed temperature metrics were used to characterize the data for each site. The 90 sites clustered into three thermal regimes based on maximum weekly maximum temperature (degrees C) and spring rate of change (degrees C . d(-1)). The centroids of regime 1, 2 and 3 had temperatures of 26.4, 28.4, 23.5 degrees C and warming rates of 0.20, 0.12 and 0.10 degrees C . d(-1), respectively. There was a regional pattern in the thermal regimes; most sites in the north were regime 1 and most sites in the south were regime 2 but neither regime was limited to those areas. Regime 3 sites were found throughout the study area. Discriminant function analysis indicated that per cent riparian forest, mean annual air temperature, per cent surface water and groundwater discharge potential influenced the thermal regimes at the sites, and demonstrated how variables at three spatial scales influence stream temperatures. This study provides a framework for thermal assessments elsewhere and demonstrates how anthropogenic activities such as riparian deforestation, groundwater withdrawal, stream regulation and climate change will all affect the main drivers of thermal regimes in streams.

Microbial community composition of transiently wetted Antarctic Dry Valley soils	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												During the summer months, wet (hyporheic) soils associated with ephemeral streams and lake edges in the Antarctic Dry Valleys (DVs) become hotspots of biological activity and are hypothesized to be an important source of carbon and nitrogen for arid DV soils. Recent research in the DV has focused on the geochemistry and microbial ecology of lakes and arid soils, with substantially less information being available on hyporheic soils. Here, we determined the unique properties of hyporheic microbial communities, resolved their relationship to environmental parameters and compared them to archetypal arid DV soils. Generally, pH increased and chlorophyll a concentrations decreased along transects from wet to arid soils (9.0 to similar to 7.0 for pH and similar to 0.8 to similar to 5 mu g/cm(3) for chlorophyll a, respectively). Soil water content decreased to below 3% in the arid soils. Community fingerprinting-based principle component analyses revealed that bacterial communities formed distinct clusters specific to arid and wet soils; however, eukaryotic communities that clustered together did not have similar soil moisture content nor did they group together based on sampling location. Collectively, rRNA pyrosequencing indicated a considerably higher abundance of Cyanobacteria in wet soils and a higher abundance of Acidobacterial, Actinobacterial, Deinococcus/Thermus, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospira, and Planctomycetes in arid soils. The two most significant differences at the genus level were Gillisia signatures present in arid soils and chloroplast signatures related to Streptophyta that were common in wet soils. Fungal dominance was observed in arid soils and Viridiplantae were more common in wet soils. This research represents an in-depth characterization of microbial communities inhabiting wet DV soils. Results indicate that the repeated wetting of hyporheic zones has a profound impact on the bacterial and eukaryotic communities inhabiting in these areas.

EVIDENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL INSTABILITY OF THE LAKE BAIKAL AREA AFTER THE LAST GLACIATION (BASED ON POLLEN RECORDS FROM PEATLANDS)	ARCHAEOLOGY ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF EURASIA												Pollen analysis of two dated sedimentary cores from lacustrine-boggy sediments in various parts of the Lake Baikal area yielded the first complete record of deep changes in the lake catchment area during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. The Early Middle Holocene record shows an optimum - a humid and mild climate with warm winters between ca 10,000 and 7000 BP. During the Late Holocene, the climate grew more and more continental, and dark coniferous forests were replaced by light coniferous ones. Comparison of variation ranges of paleogeographic events in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene recorded in our samples with previously known records for the Lake Baikal area and other regions of Eurasia indicated that major changes of vegetation and climate mostly correlate with the global ice retreat, solar radiation level, and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Less significant short-term fluctuations of vegetation and climate recorded in our archives can be regarded as regional ecosystem responses to solar activity changes of a quasi-millenary scale. Regional pollen records demonstrate a distinct relationship with the climate of the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. The amplitude of these changes is higher in the northeastern Lake Baikal area than in its southern part.

Schistosomes in the southwest United States and their potential for causing cercarial dermatitis or 'swimmer's itch'	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY					10th European Multicolloquium of Parasitology	AUG 24-29, 2008	Paris, FRANCE					Cercarial dermatitis or swimmer's itch results when cercariae of schistosomes penetrate human skin and initiate inflammatory responses. The parasites typically die in the skin but in some cases may persist and infect other organs. Cercarial dermatitis is caused by a complex and poorly known assemblage of schistosome species, and can occur in any location where people come in contact with water bodies harbouring schistosome-infected snails. In North America, most cases are reported from the upper Midwest. In south-western USA, this phenomenon has not been well studied, and it is not known which schistosome species are present, or if cercarial dermatitis occurs with any regularity. As part of our ongoing studies of schistosome diversity, using morphological traits and sequence data to differentiate species, we have thus far identified eight schistosome genetic lineages from snails from New Mexico and Colorado. We have investigated two cercarial dermatitis outbreaks, one occurring in Stubblefield Lake in northern New Mexico, and one in Prospect Lake in the heart of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The New Mexico outbreak involved either one or two different avian schistosome species, both transmitted by physid snails. The Colorado outbreak was due to Trichobilharzia brantae, a species transmitted by geese and the snail Gyraulus parvus. These outbreaks are in contrast to those in northern states where schistosomes infecting snails of the family Lymnaeidae are more often responsible for outbreaks. Our survey suggests that dermatitis-causing schistosomes are not rare in the southwest, and that there are plenty of opportunities for dermatitis outbreaks to occur in this region.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				JUN	2009	83	2			SI		191	198		10.1017/S0022149X09308020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X09308020								19366484					WOS:000266509300012

CLAIR, MICHIGAN, USA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												The presence of neutralizing antibodies against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV-IVb) was investigated in sera of 13 fish species collected from Lake St. Clair, Michigan, USA, a VHSV-endemic water body. We tested 297 sera collected May 2004 June of 2010, using a complement-dependent 50% plaque neutralization test (50% PNT). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 23% (67/297) of the samples. The highest overall antibody prevalence (85%, 34140) and mean positive antibody titer (12,113 +/- 11,699 SD) were detected in muskellunge (Esox masquinongy). Antibodies were also detected in 50% (15/30) of sampled northern pike (E. lucius), 25% (15/61) of freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), and 7% (3/41) of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). All sera from channel catfish (Ictaturus punctatus), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), quillback (Carpiodes cyprinus), rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), shorthead redhorse (Moxostoma macrolepidotum), silver redhorse (M. anisurum), walleye (Sander vitreus), white perch (Morone americana), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were negative. Antibodies in one or more fish species were detected in all sampling years (2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010), whereas in parallel sampling periods, VHS virus was detected only in 2006 and 2009. Our results suggest the continued presence of VHSV-IVb in the Lake St. Clair ecosystem, and underscore the importance of assessing immune responses of fish populations to determine prior virus exposure.					faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022														0090-3558	1943-3700				APR	2012	48	2					405	415		10.7589/0090-3558-48.2.405	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-48.2.405								22493115					WOS:000302589000014
J	Song, YZ; Guo, J; Wang, JQ				Song, Yuzhi; Guo, Jing; Wang, Jinqi			The influences of nitrogen and phosphorus availability on periphytic algae in eutrophic experimental mesocosm	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												To investigate the influence of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability on the periphytic algal biomass and assemblage composition (by pigment analysis) in the eutrophic lake, natural littoral intact sediment cores in a subtropical eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu) were collected, and subjected to three levels of water N and P loading (N-P [mg. L-1]: 1.5, 0.075; 2.5, 0.125; 3.5, 0.175) in the tanks, eighteen artificial substances (glass slides) were fixed at three water depths (1, 17, and 33 cm above the surface sediment) for development of periphytic algae in each tank, respectively. The results showed that the biomass of periphytic algae on artificial substance was significantly enhanced with increasing N and P levels in water column and water depth (p < 0.05), while sediment-associated periphytic algae did not significantly increase with increasing N and P levels in water column. The development of sediment-associated periphytic algae changed the phosphorus form, calcium-bound phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus in the sediments decreased slightly, and the total phosphorus and organic phosphorus in the sediments increased. Our results suggest that N and P availability is conducive to the development of periphytic algae in subtropical eutrophic shallow lakes in spring.

J	Jiang, LP; Fang, X				Jiang, Liping; Fang, Xing			Simulation and Validation of Cisco Lethal Conditions in Minnesota Lakes under Past and Future Climate Scenarios Using Constant Survival Limits	WATER												Fish habitat in lakes is strongly constrained by water temperature (T) and available dissolved oxygen (DO) that are changed under climate warming. A one dimensional, dynamic water quality model MINLAKE2012 was used for T and DO simulation over 48 years. A fish habitat model FishHabitat2013 using simulated T and DO profiles as input was developed to determine lethal conditions of cisco Corgenous artedi in Minnesota lakes. Twenty-three lakes that had observations of cisco mortality or survival in the unusually warm summer of 2006 were used for model validation. The cisco habitat model used a lethal temperature of 22.1 degrees C and DO survival limit of 3 mg/L determined through model validation and sensitivity analysis. Cisco lethal conditions in 12 shallow, 16 medium-depth, and 30 deep virtual lakes were then simulated. Isopleths of total number of years with cisco kill and average cisco kill days for the years with kills under past (1961-2008) and future climate were generated to understand/extrapolate climate impacts on cisco in 620 Minnesota lakes. Shallow and medium-depth lakes are projected to not be good candidates for cisco refuge lakes, but deep lakes are possible cisco refuge lakes based on lethal condition projection under future warmer climate.					liu, jingjing/K-1183-2016; Fang, Xing/AAC-4760-2021	Fang, Xing/0000-0003-4188-9013; 														2073-4441				JUL	2016	8	7							279	10.3390/w8070279	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8070279													WOS:000380764800012

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Canyon-shaped reservoirs with characteristics distinct from lakes, which have the largest storage capacities among reservoir types in China and worldwide, are often treated as artificial lakes in evaporation studies, leading to significant biases. This study, utilizing eight years observations from a floating pan on the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), explores evaporation processes unique to canyon-shaped reservoirs. The pan evaporation rate over the TGR is enhanced during periods with negative water-to-air temperature differences, which frequently occur from March to August and are consistent with the presence of temperature inversions over the river water surface. Unlike lakes, the diffusive coefficient of the pan evaporation does not exhibit a significant correlation with the horizontal wind speed, but increases significantly with the magnitude of negative water-to-air temperature difference, primarily. The phenomenon is attributed to river-valley breezes, with a roughly estimated enhancement on evaporation of 117 mm annually. The study underscores the importance of considering rivervalley breezes to accurately observe and estimate evaporation from canyon-shaped TGR.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2025	662		A						133850	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133850													WOS:001540421500001

Metabarcoding of native and invasive species in stomach contents of Great Lakes fishes	PLOS ONE												As aquatic invasive species (AIS) proliferate worldwide, a better understanding of their roles in invaded habitats is needed to inform management and introduction prevention strategies and priorities. Metabarcoding of stomach content DNA (scDNA) shows considerable promise in such regard. We thus metabarcoded scDNA from two non-native fish species (alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)), and three native ones (bloater (Coregonus hoyi), ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus)). Fishes (N = 376) were sampled in spring 2009 and 2010 from 73-128 m depths at three Lake Michigan sites. Four mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) primer sets designed to target five potential AIS prey, and a universal aquatic invertebrate CO1 primer set targeting both native and AIS prey were used. Quality controlled prey amplicons were matched to three AIS prey:Bythotrephes longimanus(mean percent frequency occurrence, all samples = 7%),Cercopagis pengoi(5%), andDreissena rostriformis bugensis(11%). Neither invasive preyDreissena polymorphanorHemimysis anomalawere detected. Native preyLeptodiaptomus sicilis,Limnocalanus macrurus, andMysis diluvianawere relatively common in scDNA (respective mean percent occurrences, all samples: 48%, 25%, 42%). Analysis of variation in prey occurrences for sample site, predator species, sample year, sample depth, and predator total length (TL) indicated site and predator species were most important. However,B.longimanusoccurrence in scDNA depended upon predator TL, perhaps indicative of its unique defensive spine limiting susceptibility to predation until fishes exceed species-specific gape-based limitations. Our analysis of native and invasive prey species indicated possible indirect AIS impacts such as native predators switching their diet due to AIS-driven losses of preferred native prey. Metabarcoding demonstrated that AIS are integrated components of the offshore Lake Michigan food web, with both native and non-native predators, and both invasive and native prey are affecting species interactions across multiple trophic levels.					; Chaganti, Subba/AAO-8118-2020	Chaganti, Subba Rao/0000-0001-9796-3986; 													1932-6203					AUG 11	2020	15	8							e0236077	10.1371/journal.pone.0236077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236077								32780731					WOS:000562664700014

Water quality improvement strategies for a coastal artificial lake	2019 3RD INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON RENEWABLE ENERGY AND DEVELOPMENT (IWRED 2019)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				3rd International Workshop on Renewable Energy and Development (IWRED)	MAR 08-10, 2019	Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	Taiyuan Univ Technol				Coastal artificial lakes were encouraged to construct in China for coastal areas remediation. However, it was difficult to keep good water quality. This study investigated water quality improvement strategies for a new coastal artificial lake, located on the coast of Zhejiang Province, China. The expected objectives of water quality in the lake were identified as controlling of algae outbreak accidents under medium eutrophication state, transparency of 1.2 m and ensuring other water quality indicators to maintain or lower than the source water quality. Water exchange was implemented, and the water retention time was designed to be less than 30 days. The sediment could be mostly removed after precipitation in the preliminary precipitation basin. For phosphorus reduction, phosphorus concentration change was predicted by box model. Suppose the active phosphate concentration of inflow water was 0.02 mg/L, when the supplied water volume increased to 18 million m(3)/a, the active phosphate concentration of the lake could achieve 0.03mg/L. As the water quality was poor in summer, the amount of water supplied was suggested increased. This study established feasible water quality guidelines for sustainable operation, and suggested effective water quality improvement strategies for similar coastal artificial lakes.																			1755-1307						2019	267								052023	10.1088/1755-1315/267/5/052023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/267/5/052023													WOS:000495369902097

A major gold deposit discovery at the north edge of Borden Lake by Probe Mines Limited in 2012 has revived the interest of both the exploration industry and the academic world in in the KSZ. The structural framework and tectonic evolution of both the KSZ and the BRGB are outlined in this communication. The BLBG is in tectonic contact with the underlying KSZ. The BLGB expands to the east over 70 km along what is probably a major transcurrent shear zone possibly being the westward extension of the Porcupine-Destor deformation zone.. Both entities were involved in multiple tectonic events, starting at 2665 Ma by widespread partial melting in the KSZ and by coeval burial of the BLGB. Nevertheless, the youngest dextral transcurrent tectonic event is the only event they have in common. Placed in its tectonic framework, the Borden gold deposit is thought to have been formed between 2665 and 2640 Ma.

J	Doubek, JP; Lehman, JT				Doubek, Jonathan P.; Lehman, John T.			Historical biomass of Limnocalanus in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The magnitude of a reported recent increase in the biomass of Limnocalanus macrurus Sars in Lake Michigan was based on a length-weight regression model developed for a different species, Diaptomus siciloides. We created a length-weight model specifically for Limnocalanus in lake Michigan and discovered that the D. siciloides model gives satisfactory estimates for animals in May but not in subsequent months. After Limnocalanus mature to C6 copepodid instars, animals progressively add mass through June. July, and August while maintaining near-constant metasome lengths and widths. Adults begin to lose mass in September as mating and reproduction begins. By August, mass estimates based on D. siciloides can underestimate Limnocalanus biomass by more than four-fold. We inspected archival Lake Michigan collections of Limnocalanus from 1985 to 1992 and calculated a mean summer biomass of 16.2 mg DW/m(3), which is approximately 3.5 times greater than previously reported. The pattern displayed by Limnocalanus is consistent with its univoltine life history and synchronized cohort structure. Biomass may have genuinely increased since 2004, but the magnitude of the increase is likely much greater than reported. Increased numerical abundance of Limnocalanus cohorts surviving to reproductive age appears to be the main reason for their increased biomass. This has important consequences for trophic interactions, bioenergetic considerations, and relative dominance with respect to Cladocera and Diaptomidae in Lake Michigan.

J	Hamilton-Taylor, J; Smith, EJ; Davison, W; Sugiyama, M				Hamilton-Taylor, J; Smith, EJ; Davison, W; Sugiyama, M			Resolving and modeling the effects of Fe and Mn redox cycling on trace metal behavior in a seasonally anoxic lake	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Vertical profiles of the dissolved and particulate (> 0.45 mu m) concentrations of Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Ph, At and Ba were determined on two occasions (14 and 22 August 1996) during summer stratification in a seasonally anoxic lake (Esthwaite Water, UK). The results were combined with contemporaneous in situ measurements of water-column remobilization of the metals from settling particles at the base of the suboxic zone and other ancillary measurements. The combined data were interpreted with the aid of an equilibrium speciation model (WHAM6), incorporating metal-humic interactions and a surface-complexation description of binding to Fe and Mn oxides. The behavior of all the metals was related in different ways to the position of the O-2-H2S interface and to Fe and Mn redox cycling. In the region of the O-2-H2S interface the behavior of Co and to a lesser degree Ni was dominated by Mn redox cycling. Ba behavior was dominated by the biogenic precipitation and dissolution of barite and to a lesser degree by Mn redox cycling. The behavior of A1 was linked to both Mn and Fe redox cycling, although the extent of binding to the oxides and to humic substances was poised with respect to pH. Unlike the other metals, the profiles of Ph and Cu showed little variation above the dissolved sulfide maximum, but modeling indicated that binding of Ph was significant to both Mn and Fe oxides. The featureless nature of the Cu profiles in the upper part of the water column was linked to its overriding association with dissolved humic substances. Below the dissolved sulfide maximum, Co, Ni, Ba, Cu, Ph and Mn were all affected by sulfide precipitation, probably through a common association with FeS. In the case of Co, Ni, Cu and Ph, inverse relationships between the measured dissolved and particulate concentrations were attributed to the coexistence of both filterable and nonfilterable FeS particles and associated mass balance effects. The observed behavior of the metals in relation to the role played by Fe and Mn oxides was generally consistent with WHAM6 predictions. The model predictions highlighted the fact that trace metal speciation in general, and binding to Mn and Fe oxides in particular, can be highly sensitive to the variations in solution conditions found in freshwater systems.

In this area the three basic conditions inducing debris flow developed. The widely distributed accumulation of collapse and landslide provide the main solid sources of debris flow; the high and steep slopes along the Valley of Edaobai River take the landform of steps with a big gradient,to provide the moving way; and the concentrated rainstorm in summer provide debris flow for the force to move. The mount-slope type is the main type of debris flow occurred in the area, and it can be classified into further two sub-types according to the formation condition and activity, namely frequently active debris flow and relative stable debris flow.

The summer 2019 expedition to the Yamal Peninsula revealed historic petroleum pollution of the tundra area adjacent to "Yamalsky" natural reserve. Soil, surface water and bottom sediments from a downhill lake, and herbaceous plant Eriophorum scheuchzeri samples were collected to address the origin and the level of the aged pollution, and to investigate, if E. scheuchzeri species could be a potential phytoremediation agent. Compositional GC-MS analysis of the soil organic matter showed that diesel fuel spillage affected the study area and the territories nearby. Weathered diesel compounds penetrated the soil and reached the permafrost layer at 85 cm depth. Petroleum hydrocarbon level peaked at 11% (wt) in the topsoil at the polluted site and 3% (wt) in the bottom sediments of the downhill lake, demonstrating chronic ecosystem exposure. The following ICP-MS analysis showed presence of trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, Ba, Pb, Bi, U) in the soil, water, and E. scheuchzeri samples. Observed concentrations of V, Cr, Cd, Pb, Ni, and Zn in the soil samples exceeded the background values by 3.6, 2.3, 9.7, 2.9, and 3.0 times, respectively. V (0.4 mg/L) and Cr (0.12 mg/L) levels in the lake water exceeded the established national limits by 40 and 2.4 times, respectively, which demonstrated the possibility of pollution migration with groundwater or surface water. The plant E. scheuchzeri tolerated diesel pollution and stimulated natural attenuation, bioaccumulating Mo, Cd, Ba, and Bi in its tissue from the soil. E. scheuchzeri is proposed for phytoremediation of Arctic soils polluted with petroleum and metals. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Stock assessment for eastern oyster seed production and field grow-out in Louisiana	AQUACULTURE												There is little information on the performance of oyster populations from Louisiana estuaries limiting the ability to choose stocks for hatchery seed production and field grow-out. The objectives of this study were therefore to compare the mortality, growth, dermo (Perkinsus marinus) infection intensity and condition index of the progeny of wild oysters collected from three Louisiana estuaries differing in salinity regime and oysters specifically selected for dermo resistance. Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding. This initial result suggests that the stocks used are genetically differentiated with respect to low salinity tolerance as well as dermo-related mortality at high salinity and that stock selection for aquaculture grow-out or restoration effort will benefit from being site-specific and dependent on the dominant environmental conditions.

J	SHOLKOVITZ, ER; COPLAND, D				SHOLKOVITZ, ER; COPLAND, D			THE MAJOR-ELEMENT CHEMISTRY OF SUSPENDED PARTICLES IN THE NORTH BASIN OF WINDERMERE	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Detailed vertical profiles were taken in the north basin of Lake Windermere between July and Nov. 1980. Measurements were made of temperature, dissolved O2, pH, total suspended load and the major-element composition (organic C, Al, Fe, Mn, Si, S, P, Ca, Mg, Ba and K) of suspended particles. Excess concentrations (those reactive phases not supported by detrital phases) of particulate S, P, Ca, Mg, Ba and K are highest in the epilimnion due to their incorporation into the growing phytoplankton. These elements are associated with planktonic organic matter and are rapidly recycled in the upper 25 m of this 60 m oxic lake. This is documented by the decrease with depth of excess concentrations of S, P, Ca, Mg, Ba and K and their ratios to POC. Large concentrations of excess particulate Si occur in the hypolimnion as the result of the settling out of diatom skeletal matter produced near the surface during the spring bloom. These siliceous particles do not contain significant quantities of excess particulate S, P, Ca, Mg, Ba and K. Evidently, organic matter is the important recycling matrix for these inorganic elements. Elevated concentrations of excess particulate Mn at depth indicate that there is a Mn-redox cycle operating in the lake.

High-altitude lakes are good sentinels of global change. However, their value as sentinels depends on how well we understand their functioning. This study analysed physical, chemical and biological data during three pre-defined periods running from complete ice-cover right to the end of the ice-free season, in a high-altitude oligotrophic lake. A functional approach was used to assess how relationships between DOM and the planktonic community vary over time. Phytoplankton functional change was found to occur with shifts in DOM. During the ice-influenced period, from February to the end of the thaw, the phytoplankton community was dominated by small autotrophs and mixotrophic flagellates and DOM from sediment and terrestrial origin dominated the DOM pool of the lake. Phytoplankton diversity and richness increased during the post-snowmelt overturn period, when terrestrial DOM dominated the DOM pool. Finally, large siliceous autotrophs, competitive under low nitrogen concentrations and high temperature, dominated almost exclusively during the late summer period (LSP). Increased phytoplankton biomass meant that phytoplankton-derived DOM was dominant during the LSP. These phenological changes in the phytoplankton community resulted in functional shifts at the base of the food web. Based on the relationships between the variables in the study, it can be deduced that the nature of the relationship between phytoplankton and bacteria progressively shifted from strong top-down control exerted by phytoplankton over bacteria towards predominantly bottom-up control at the end of the ice-free season. Synthesis. Using a field survey starting from complete ice-cover and lasting right to the end of the ice-free season in a sentinel lake, we show seasonal shifts in the link between DOM properties and plankton community traits. Differences in environmental conditions and DOM origin explained variation in phytoplankton community structure and function, pointing to seasonal shifts in microbial food web interactions. Our research suggests that, under climate change, the balance between mixotrophy and autotrophy and the control exerted by phytoplankton over bacterioplankton will change in oligotrophic high-altitude lakes with large, vegetated catchments.

The study lakes fell into two groups: (1) pristine, oligotrophic, mostly located in the SE mountain terrain, and (2) impacted, eutrophic, in the NW plateau region. Sediment samples were collected from the central, deepest zone of each lake and analyzed for texture (grain size), carbonate content, and organic C and N. Water variables were measured in the water column overlying the sediment collection sites. Specific conductance, chlorophyll a, and total particulate carbon were higher in impacted, eutrophic plateau lakes than in pristine mountain lakes. Sediments, although composed mostly of silts, differed in grain size. Pristine, oligotrophic mountain lakes possessed coarser sediments, with a higher concentration of most likely recalcitrant organic carbon, than impacted, eutrophic plateau lakes. Topography/location is the primary factor that contributes to sediment differences, whereas eutrophication, caused by deforestation and agricultural runoff, is the second most important agent modifying sediment characteristics. The only pristine plateau lake, San Jose, had water quality similar to pristine mountain lakes, but finer sediments with lower organic C, N, and C/N. Comparison of San Jose sediments with those of impacted eutrophic plateau lakes indicated eutrophication has led to coarser sediments, as well as enrichment in CO3, organic C and N. Eutrophication-related sediment characteristics are valuable variables that can be used in paleolimnological studies to identify the onset of lake eutrophication in tropical karst water bodies.					; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773; Prado, Blanca/0000-0001-8751-8280; Mora Palomino, Lucy Natividad/0000-0002-8282-5342; Oseguera Perez, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-8405-9656; Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2021	66	3					333	353		10.1007/s10933-021-00210-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00210-z		JUL 2021											WOS:000678517700001

Long-term change in limnology and invertebrates in Alaskan boreal wetlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Climate change is more pronounced at high northern latitudes, and may be affecting the physical, chemical, and biological attributes of the abundant wetlands in boreal forests. On the Yukon Flats, located in the boreal forest of northeast Alaska, wetlands originally sampled during 1985-1989 were re-sampled for water chemistry and macroinvertebrates in summer 2001-2003. Wetlands sampled lost on average 19% surface water area between these periods. Total nitrogen and most metal cations (Na, Mg, and Ca, but not K) increased between these periods, whereas total phosphorus and chlorophyll a (Chl a) declined. These changes were greater in wetlands that had experienced more drying (decreased surface area). Compared with 1985-1989, densities of cladocerans, copepods, and ostracods in both June and August were much higher in 2002-2003, whereas densities of amphipods, gastropods, and chironomid larvae were generally lower. In comparisons among wetlands in 2002-2003 only, amphipod biomass was lower in wetlands with lower Chl a, which might help explain the decline of amphipods since the late 1980s when Chl a was higher. The decline in Chl a corresponded to greatly increased zooplankton density in June, suggesting a shift in carbon flow from scrapers and deposit-feeders to water-column grazers. Declines in benthic and epibenthic deposit-feeding invertebrates suggest important food web effects of climate change in otherwise pristine wetlands of the boreal forest.																			0018-8158					MAR	2009	620						77	89		10.1007/s10750-008-9616-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9616-5													WOS:000261987900007
J	Jin, ZY; Qin, SM				Jin, Zhi Yi; Qin, Shao Ming			Habitat Selection of Scaly-sided Merganser under Multiple Area Scales in Water Systems of Poyang Lake, China	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Habitat selection of the Endangered Scaly-sided Merganser Mergus squamatus was studied in four rivers of Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, China at landscape and micro-habitat scales, from November 2017 to March 2018 and November 2018 to March 2019. At landscape scale, the main foraging habitats of this species include woodlands and farmlands. The largest proportion of woodland in the habitats was 88.70%. Proportion of shoals in foraging habitats at 500-m, 1000-m, 1500-m and 5000-m scales were larger than that in control plots, indicating that the presence of shoals is an important factor determining habitat selection of this bird. At micro-habitat scale, water flow speed (P=0.044), and distance to road (P=0.018) and village (P=0.001) were significantly greater than in control plots. Principal component analysis showed that safety factors (vegetation cover on both banks, distance to a mine factory and river width) were the three most important habitat factors, indicating that Scaly-sided Merganser had high requirements for shelter and safety. Twenty two species offish belonging to eight families and three orders were identified in foraging areas of the Scaly-sided Merganser. We could identify only six fish species eaten by the merganser viz., Carassius auratus, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, Noemacheilus fasciolatus, Silurus asotus, Tachysurus fulvidraco and Siniperca chuatsi, which were relatively common and present in all the four rivers, indicating that this bird was an opportunist predator. It is important to reduce human activities and protect woodland and aquatic environments because Scaly-sided Merganser have high requirements for safety and water conditions under both landscape and micro-habitat scales.																			0030-9923					AUG	2020	52	4					1355	1362		10.17582/journal.pjz/20190824090851	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/20190824090851													WOS:000531029600016
J	Liu, Y; Zhang, QQ				Liu, Yang; Zhang, Qianqian			Study on the Spatiotemporal Variation in and Driving Mechanism of Water Quality in Baiyangdian Lake	WATER												Analyzing 165 data from five national control sites in Baiyangdian Lake, this study unveils its spatiotemporal pattern of water quality. Utilizing machine learning and multivariate statistical techniques, this study elucidates the effects of rainfall and human activities on the lake's water quality. The results show that the main pollutants in Baiyangdian Lake are TN, TP, and IMN. Spatially, human activities are the main drivers of water quality, with the poorest quality observed in the surrounding village area. The temporal dynamics of water quality parameters exhibit three distinct patterns: Firstly, parameters predominantly influenced by point source pollution, like TN and NH4+-N, show lower concentrations during flood periods. Secondly, parameters affected by non-point source pollution, such as TP, show higher concentrations during flood periods. Thirdly, irregular variations were observed in pH, DO, and IMN. The evaluation of Baiyangdian Lake's water quality based on the grey relationship analysis method indicates that its water quality is good, falling within Classes I and II. Time series analysis found that the dilution effect of rainfall and the scouring action of runoff dominate the temporal variation in water quality in Baiyangdian Lake. The major pollution sources were identified as domestic sewage, followed by agricultural non-point source pollution and the release of internal pollutants. Additionally, aquaculture emerged as a significant contributor to the Lake's pollution. This research provides a scientific basis for controlling the continuous deterioration of Baiyangdian Lake's water quality and restoring its ecological function.

J	Bockheim, JG				Bockheim, James G.			Diversity of diagnostic horizons in soils of the contiguous USA: A case study	CATENA					EUROSOIL Meeting	OCT 16-21, 2016	Istanbul, TURKEY	EUROSOIL				Many previous studies of pedodiversity have emphasized the lateral variability of soils. In this study, the vertical distribution of diagnostic horizons is examined at the soil-series level. Unlike genetic horizons, diagnostic soil horizons are based on quantitatively defined morphological and analytical properties; and they form the basis of modem soil classification systems. An examination of 1600 soil series in 63 representative (out of 226) Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) in contiguous USA revealed that they contain from one to seven diagnostic soil horizons, with an average of 2.6 +/- 1.2. About 20% of the soil series contain 4 or more diagnostic horizons; 80% of these soil series are in seven great groups: the Glossudalfs, Haplorthods, Fragiorthods, Endoaquods, Epiaquods, Fraglossudalfs, and Glossaqualfs. The Laurentide Great Lakes region contains a discordant number (57%) of soils with 4 or more diagnostic horizons, the most common being ochric (100%), albic (91%), argillic (85%), glossic (69%), spodic (51%), and a fragipan (19%). Several factors appear to contribute to the diversity of diagnostic horizons, including proximity to the Great Lakes where abundant snowfall precludes soil freezing and enables water to percolate rapidly through the soil in a short interval during the spring, the prevalence of stratified glacial deposits often containing a lithologic discontinuity, and a fluctuating water table, all of which enable specific weathering products to accumulate at different depths.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2018	168				SI		5	13		10.1016/j.catena.2017.10.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.10.016													WOS:000437053000002

Kinetic properties of ELFP hydrolysis by natural extracellular phosphatases are, however, mostly unknown. We indirectly studied the affinity of extracellular phosphatases for ELFP in different aquatic environments through its ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). Values of inhibition constants, K-i, which correspond to the concentrations necessary for half saturation of phosphatases by ELFP, were lowest (0.18-4.5 mu mol L-1) in the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea. We found higher values (i.e. lower affinity) in oligo- to mesotrophic acidified lakes (5.2-14 mu mol L-1), in a eutrophic reservoir (13-35 mu mol L-1) and in a pure culture of the marine bacterium Alteromonas infernus (29 mu mol L-1). ELFP had a pronounced effect on the parameter KM ( Michaelis constant) of 4MUP saturation kinetics, while its effect on the parameter V-max was low. This behaviour is compatible with the assumption of competitive interaction between 4MUP and ELFP. Our experiments indicated that the assay ELFP concentration in the detection kit used was 250-500 mu mol L-1 ( after the recommended dilution to a ratio of 1:20), which would ensure > 99% saturation of extracellular phosphatases in marine environments and > 90% saturation in the studied fresh waters.

Elevated temperatures reduce population-specific transcriptional plasticity in developing lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Rising mean and variance in temperatures elevates threats to endangered freshwater species such as lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens. Previous research demonstrated that higher temperatures during development result in physiological consequences for lake sturgeon populations throughout Manitoba, Canada, with alteration of meta- bolic rate, thermal tolerance, transcriptional responses, growth and mortality. We ac- climated lake sturgeon (30- 60 days post fertilization, a period of high mortality) from northern and southern populations (56 degrees 02'46.5?N, 96 degrees 54'18.6?W and 50 degrees 17'52?N, 95 degrees 32'51?W, respectively, separated by approximately 650 km) within Manitoba to current (summer highs of 20- 23 degrees C) and future projected (+2- 3 degrees C) environmental temperatures of 16, 20 and 24 degrees C for 30 days, and we measured gill transcriptional responses using RNAseq. Transcripts revealed SNPs consistent with genetically distinct populations and transcriptional responses altered by acclimation tempera- ture. There were a higher number of differentially expressed transcripts observed in the southern, compared to the northern, population as temperatures increased, indicating enhanced transcriptional plasticity. Both lake sturgeon populations re- sponded to elevated acclimation temperatures by downregulating the transcription of genes involved in protein synthesis and energy production. Furthermore, there were population-specific thresholds for the downregulation of processes promoting transcriptional plasticity as well as mitochondrial function as the northern population showed decreases at 20 degrees C, while this capacity was not diminished until 24 degrees C in the southern population. These transcriptional responses highlight the molecular impacts of increasing temperatures for divergent lake sturgeon populations during vulnerable developmental periods and the critical influence of transcriptome plasticity on ac- climation capacity.					; Marshall, Katie/AFK-5175-2022; Thorstensen, Matt/AAC-8756-2022	Marshall, Katie/0000-0002-6991-4957; bugg, william/0000-0003-4469-0026; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				JUL	2023	32	14					4044	4062		10.1111/mec.16967	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.16967		MAY 2023						37150896					WOS:000982676000001
J	Inoue, J; Usuki, T				Inoue, Jun; Usuki, Tatsuya			Effects of particle size and pretreatment methods on the morphometry of grass charcoal particles: Implications for morphometric analysis of microcharcoal particles	HOLOCENE												The morphometry of sedimentary charcoal particles illuminates the source fuel types. This study explores the variation in morphometry (specifically, the length-to-width (L/W) ratio) of charcoal particles of different sizes, using charcoal collected from Miscanthus sinensis (Japanese pampas grass) fields following controlled burning. We also investigated the impact of pretreatment processes on sedimentary microcharcoals. The results indicate a general decrease in the L/W ratio with decreasing particle size, with the microcharcoal exhibiting a substantial decrease. The mean L/W ratios for size categories of 250 mu m-1 mm, 125-250 mu m, 63-125 mu m, and <63 mu m in size are 6.42, 5.54, 4.94, and 3.45, respectively. Furthermore, pretreatment processes for microcharcoal decrease the L/W ratio. Consequently, the L/W ratio of grass microcharcoal (<125 mu m) likely falls within 50-80% of the ratios observed in grass macrocharcoal (>125 mu m), necessitating caution in interpreting microcharcoal data. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering particle size and pretreatment effects when interpreting paleofire records and highlight the need for further research to establish robust cutoff values for fuel type inference based on charcoal morphometry, particularly for microcharcoal.

The microcystin content of lyophilized samples extracted with aqueous methanol was determined on the basis of the colorimetric PP-1 inhibition assay with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. With the test system described, an IC50 of 1 ng/mL reaction volume (similar to 0.6 nM PP-I) was determined for microcystin-1R standard, corresponding to 20 ng microcystin-LR per milliliter sample volume. The microcystin content of field samples estimated on the basis of the PP-1 inhibition assay was compared to that obtained by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and a good correlation was observed (r = 0.9202, P < 0.0001), The mean difference in microcystin content based on PP-I inhibition was determined to be 27.9 +/- 22.9% (n = 50) related to measurements based on RP-HPLC analysis. There was no observation of false positive or false negative results in this study. The results confirm the suitability of the PP-1 inhibition assay with regard to a preliminary screening of cyanobacterial field samples for microcystin.

J	Kiryukhin, A				Kiryukhin, Alexey			Modeling and observations of geyser activity in relation to catastrophic landslides-mudflows (Kronotsky nature reserve, Kamchatka, Russia)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												This study reports and interprets observational data of geyser cycling in the Valley of Geysers and Uzon hydro thermal systems between 2007 and 2015. The monitoring of the Velikan and Bolshoy Geysers after the catastrophic landslide on 3.06.2007 (which dammed and created Podprudnoe Lake, drowning some geysers) and before a mudflow on 3.01.2014 (which destroyed the dam and almost completely drained Podprudnoe Lake) shows that the interval between eruptions (IBE) of the Bolshoy Geyser decreased from 108 to 63 min and that the IBE of the Velikan Geyser slowly declined over three years from 379 min to 335 min. The seasonal hydrological cycle of the Velikan Geyser shows an increase in the IBE during winter (average of 41 min). The dilution of the chloride deep components of the Bolshoy (-23%) and Velikan Geysers (-12%) is also observed. A local TOUGH2 model of the Velikan Geyser is developed. This model is used to describe the transient thermal hydrodynamic and CO2 changes in a Velikan Geyser conduit during the entire cycling process by using cyclic, time-dependent boundary mass flow conditions (major eruption discharge and sub-cyclically assigned CO2 mass flow recharge into the base of the geyser conduit and water recharge at the mid-height of the geyser conduit) and a constant mass flow of water into the geyser at depth. This model also indicates a seepage element at the conduit's top to allow pre-eruptive discharge and a buffering isothermal reservoir below to compensate for pressure declines from major eruptions at earlier times. A local TOUGH2 model is successfully calibrated against temperature observations at both the mid-height and base of the conduit of the Velikan Geyser, which shows the essential role of the above parameters in describing the functionality of the geyser. A reservoir model of shallow production geysers is also developed. This 2D model is used to describe changes in the thermal hydrodynamic state and evolving chloride concentrations in the areas of most prominent discharge, both at steady state and when perturbed by cold water injection from Podprudnoe Lake and other cold water sources (after 3.062007). A "well on deliver ability" option is used to model the geyser discharge features in the model. The modeled increases in geyser discharge that is caused by an increase in the reservoir pressure from cold water injection reasonably matches observations of IBE decreases in the Bolshoy (similar to 58%) and Velikan Geysers (similar to 9%). The modeling also shows the possibility of chloride dilution in the Velikan Geyser but no dilution in the Bolshoy Geyser.

Mass-Marking Reveals Emerging Self Regulation of the Chinook Salmon Population in Lake Huron	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												All Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha stocked in Lake Huron during 2000-2003 were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC), fin clips, or a combination thereof to determine the relative contributions of natural reproduction and stocking to recruitment. Oxytetracycline administered in feed proved to be an effective, low-cost method of marking spring fingerling Chinook salmon. Vertebrae proved to be suitable tissue for OTC detection, meeting standards for accuracy and reproducibility. Vertebrae were not suitable as aging structures, perhaps due to the slow somatic growth of Lake Huron's Chinook salmon during this study. Based on lakewide recoveries from recreational and commercial fisheries, we estimated that nearly 80% of Chinook salmon from the marked year-classes were from natural reproduction. Wild-origin Chinook salmon constituted 96% of open-water samples from Georgian Bay; 82, 80, and 68% of those from the central, southern, and northern portions of the main basin; and 64% of those from the North Channel. The percentage of wild-origin Chinook salmon in some tributaries in the Ontario watershed of Lake Huron approached 100%. There was less variation in wild recruitment between years than between lake areas. This Chinook salmon population was introduced in the late 1960s and until recently had been widely viewed as hatchery dependent; our findings suggest otherwise. A self-sustaining predator population would represent a paradigm shift from an era when predation rates could be manipulated by adjusting salmonid stocking (i.e., 1968 to about 1995). These findings should help managers to critically review the effects of stocked Chinook salmon on Lake Huron's fisheries and ecosystem, including prey consumption demand, and to assess future needs for propagated Chinook salmon in Lake Huron.																			0275-5947					APR	2010	30	2					518	529		10.1577/M09-094.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M09-094.1													WOS:000277947800017
J	Hesse, PP; Magee, JW; van der Kaars, S				Hesse, PP; Magee, JW; van der Kaars, S			Late Quaternary climates of the Australian arid zone: a review	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Aridity in Australia has generally been associated with glacial intervals of the last few glacial cycles. The causes and nature of aridity varied from north to south over the continent. In northern and central Australia, reduced monsoon rain in global cold stages caused lakes and rivers to dry, vegetation to become more sparse, sand dunes to become active, and dust advection to increase. While the monsoon is correlated with warmer global temperatures and high sea levels overall, the exact timing of the greatest development of the monsoon in Stage 5 remains uncertain. In Southeastern Australia, the proxy records give a less clear picture. While vegetation seems to have been more sparse in cold stages and sand dune activity and dust flux consequently greater, records of runoff in rivers and lakes have mixed or opposite behaviour to northern or central Australia. The nature of aridity in southeastern Australia is not analogous to conditions anywhere on the continent today. Greatly reduced temperatures over the central and Southern interior, greater influence of snow and periglaciation on runoff, high groundwater tables, lower rainfall and reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may all have contributed to and interacted to produce the reconstructed picture of a cold, sparsely vegetated arid landscape with large rivers and perennial lakes. The largest changes in circulation patterns over the glacial cycle probably Occurred in the location and/or intensity of summer tropical convergence in northern Australia. Over southern Australia, changes to the temperature arid humidity of the westerly circulation have been more significant than the small fluctuations in latitude of the sub-tropical high pressure ridge.

While the occurrence of hypoxia was observed in many lakes, a detailed quantification of hypoxia spread at centennial timescales remained largely unquantified. We track the evolution of hypoxia and its controls during the past 200 years in a lake, Tiefer See (TSK; NE Germany), using 17 gravity cores recovered from between 10 and 62 m water depth in combination with lake monitoring data. Lake hypoxia was associated with the onset of varve preservation in the TSK and has been dated by varve counting to 1918 +/- 1 at 62 m water depth and reached a lake floor depth of 16 m in 1997 +/- 1. This indicates that oxygen concentration fell below the threshold for varve preservation at the lake floor (> 16 m). Sediment cores at 10-12 m depth do not contain varves indicating good oxygenation of the upper-water column. Monitoring data show that the threshold for hypoxia, and the intensity and duration of hypoxia which are sufficient for varve preservation, is a period of 5 months of [O-2] < 5 mg L-1 and 2 months of [O-2] < 2 mg L-1. Detailed total organic carbon (TOC), delta(13)Corg, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning analyses of the short cores indicate that the decline in dissolved oxygen (DO) started several decades prior to the varve preservation. This proves a change in the depositional conditions in the lake, following a transition phase of several decades during which varves were not preserved. Furthermore, varve preservation does occur at seasonal stratification and does not necessarily require permanent stratification.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Sirota, Ido/0000-0001-5014-4369; Tjallingii, Rik/0000-0002-9723-3622; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Kearney, Rebecca/0000-0001-8997-6808; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 2	2024	21	19					4317	4339		10.5194/bg-21-4317-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-4317-2024													WOS:001326762300001

This flood was caused by a long period of intense rainfall with a maximum intensity of 230 mm per day. During this event, a landslide dam, which previously held a small lake, failed. The flood wave originating from the dam breach transported a large volume of sediment (more than 50 000 m(3)) derived from bank erosion and the massive undercutting of a talus cone. This caused a fundamental transformation of the downstream channel system including the redistribution of large woody debris and channel switching. Using terrestrial survey and aerial photography, erosional and depositional consequences of the event were mapped, pre- and post-event surfaces were compared and the sediment budget of the event calculated for ten consecutive channel reaches downstream of the former lake. According to the calculations more than 100 000 tonnes of sediment were eroded, 75% of which was redeposited within the channel and the proximal floodplain. A previous large flood which occurred a few weeks prior to the August 2005 event had a significant effect on controlling the impact of this event.

J	Han, JQ; Zhang, W; Fan, YY; Yu, MQ				Han, Jianqiao; Zhang, Wei; Fan, Yongyang; Yu, Mengqing			Interacting effects of multiple factors on the morphological evolution of the meandering reaches downstream the Three Gorges Dam	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Elucidating the influence of dams on fluvial processes can inform river protection and basin management. However, relatively few studies have focused on how multiple factors interact to affect the morphological evolution of meandering reaches. Using hydrological and topographical data, we analyzed the factors that influence and regulate the meandering reaches downstream the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). Our conclusions are as follows. (1) The meandering reaches can be classified into two types based on their evolution during the pre-dam period: G1 reaches, characterized by convex point bar erosion and concave channel deposition (CECD), and G2 reaches, characterized by convex point bar deposition and concave channel erosion (CDCE). Both reach types exhibited CECD features during the post-dam period. (2) Flow processes and sediment transport are the factors that caused serious erosion of the low beaches located in the convex point bars. However, changes in the river regime, river boundaries and jacking of Dongting Lake do not act as primary controls on the morphological evolution of the meandering reaches. (3) Flood discharges ranging from 20,000 to 25,000 m(3)/s result in greater erosion of convex point bars. The point bars become scoured if the durations of these flows, which are close to bankfull discharge, exceed 20 days. In addition, the reduction in bedload causes the decreasing of point bar siltation in the water-falling period. (4) During the post-dam period, flood abatement, the increased duration of discharges ranging from 20,000 to 25,000 m(3)/s, and a significant reduction in sediment transport are the main factors that caused meandering reaches to show CECD features. Our results are relevant to other meandering reaches, where they can inform estimates of riverbed change, river management strategies and river protection.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				OCT	2017	27	10					1268	1278		10.1007/s11442-017-1434-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-017-1434-0													WOS:000404923500007

Eutrophication mediates rapid clonal evolution in Daphnia pulicaria	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Laboratory studies have revealed that Daphnia species can evolve to tolerate toxic cyanobacteria in the diet. Specifically, Daphnia from eutrophic lakes where cyanobacteria are common tend to have higher growth rates and survival when fed toxic cyanobacteria than populations from oligotrophic environments with low abundance of cyanobacteria. We conducted an in-lake mesocosm (i.e. limnocorral) experiment during the autumn of 2009 to assess the effects of nutrient enrichment on clonal evolution in Daphnia pulicaria. As nutrient enrichment often favours grazing-resistant cyanobacteria, we hypothesised that fertilisation would influence the genotypic composition of D. pulicaria that vary in tolerance to cyanobacteria. Mesocosms were fertilised to manipulate phytoplankton and cyanobacterial abundance and concentrations of a cyanobacterial toxin (microcystin). Thus, half of the mesocosms were high-nutrient and half were low-nutrient. We then stocked half of the mesocosms with a mixture of six genetically-distinct D. pulicaria genotypes (three genotypes from oligotrophic lakes and three from eutrophic lakes) leaving half of the mesocosms Daphnia-free to assess grazing effects, using a fully factorial design. When compared to the low nutrient treatment, high nutrient mesocosms had nearly five-fold higher chlorophyll a concentrations, eight-fold higher cyanobacterial dry biomass, and three-fold higher microcystin levels at the start of the experiment. In contrast, low nutrient mesocosms had phytoplankton concentrations typical of mesotrophic lakes. Fertilisation strongly affected Daphnia genetic diversity in the mesocosms. Final Daphnia genotype diversity in the mesocosms with low-cyanobacteria (richness = 5.83, Shannon-Weiner index = 1.55, evenness = 0.88) was similar to the initial stocked diversity (richness = 5.50, Shannon-Weiner index = 1.48, evenness = 0.87). In contrast, final diversity in fertilised mesocosms with high cyanobacteria was greatly reduced (richness = 2, Shannon-Weiner index = 0.17), with one Daphnia genotype that originated from the most-eutrophic lake being highly dominant (evenness = 0.25). Thus, eutrophication mediated strong clonal selection of a cyanobacteria-tolerant Daphnia genotype over just 10 weeks. By the end of the experiment, Daphnia significantly reduced phytoplankton biomass in the high-nutrient, but not in the low-nutrient treatment. This difference in effect size was largely driven by the five-fold higher initial phytoplankton biomass in the high-nutrient treatment. Thus, the ability of Daphnia to reduce phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic lakes may be driven more so by the abundance of planktivorous fishes, as opposed to the prevalence of cyanobacteria and their associated toxins.

UV/PAR radiation and DOM properties in surface coastal waters of the Canadian shelf of the Beaufort Sea during summer 2009	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Surface waters from the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean were evaluated for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and optical characteristics including UV (ultraviolet) radiation and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) diffuse attenuation (K-d), and chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM and FDOM) as part of the MALINA field campaign (30 July to 27 August). Spectral absorption coefficients (a(CDOM) (350 nm) (m(-1))) were significantly correlated to both diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-d) in the UV-A and UV-B and to DOC concentrations. This indicates CDOM as the dominant attenuator of both UV and PAR solar radiation and suggests its use as an optical proxy for DOC concentrations in this region. While the Mackenzie input is the main driver of CDOM dynamics in low salinity waters, locally, primary production can create significant increases in CDOM. Extrapolating CDOM to DOC relationships, we estimate that similar to 16% of the DOC in the Mackenzie River does not absorb radiation at 350 nm. The discharges of DOC and its chromophoric subset (CDOM) by the Mackenzie River during the MALINA cruise are estimated as similar to 0.22 TgC and 0.18 TgC, respectively. Three dissolved fluorescent components (C1-C3) were identified by fluorescence excitation/emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Our results showed an aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) component (C1), probably produced in the numerous lakes of the watershed, that co-dominated with a terrestrial humic-like component (C2) in the Mackenzie Delta Sector. This aquatic DOM could partially explain the high CDOM spectral slopes observed in the Beaufort Sea.

Two new species are described (type locality in parenthesis): D. wirthi (New Jersey. Ocean: Forked River (39 degrees 50.1'N, 74 degrees 11.8'W)) and D. zacki (Idaho. Boundary: Perkins Lake (48 degrees 45.4'N, 116 degrees 05.5'W)). The identity of N. transversa Walker, which had been a nomen dubium, is established and is discovered to be conspecific with D. ussurica Krivosheina, the latter thus being a junior synonym. Dichaeta choui Fan, described from specimens collected in China, is recognized as a junior synonym of D. caudata. In the phylogenetic analysis, the tribe Notiphilini is found to be a well-established, well-corroborated, nionophyletic lineage comprising two genera, Dichaeta and Noliphila Fallen. Dichaeta is found to be the sister group to Notiphila sensu lato and is accorded generic status, which is a reversion to its former placement when first described. All known species are described with an emphasis on structures of the male terminalia, which are fully illustrated. Detailed locality data and distribution maps for the Nearctic Region are provided.

The fine silt and clay-rich valley fills accumulated for a period of 15,000 years between similar to 33 ka and similar to 17 ka, including the very and Last Glacial Maximum. For a permanent wetland to exist during peak regional aridity when the majority of lakes were drying throughout Australia required a substantial reduction in high intensity summer rainfall events as well as greatly reduced evaporation. A late Pleistocene wetland could be maintained even with lower precipitation provided evaporation is reduced to 25% of present. The model showed that this would be possible if mean maximum monthly temperatures were only 6 degrees C cooler. The wetland sediments contain reworked aeolian dust. Geochemical and isotopic analyses of samples collected from Lake Torrens and from within the ranges indicate that during wetter phases fine sediment was transported westwards from the mountains to accumulate in the Lake Torrens playa and during drier phases aeolian dust was blown from the playa eastwards into the massif, where it was eventually incorporated into the late Pleistocene fine-grained valley-fill deposits.																			1266-5304	1957-777X				OCT-DEC	2006		4					249	258																WOS:000243765000003

This study presents a high-resolution Holocene pollen record (similar to 9700 years) from XingCo Lake in the Zoige Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. We conducted pollen analysis, biome reconstruction, and diversity assessment. Key findings include: 1) Pollen records from the Zoige Basin showed a consistent long-term trend of forest decline since the mid-Holocene, with multiple abrupt vegetation shifts. 2) After excluding Cyperaceae pollen, we observed a marked collapse of the Holocene vegetation optimum around 3.5 cal ka BP, aligned with transitions across the eastern Tibetan Plateau. 3) A notable shift in vegetation richness occurred around 2 cal ka BP under stable vegetation and minimal human impact, coinciding with a decoupling of temperature and moisture, and rising temperatures coupled with declining humidity, fostering increased palynological richness. These results suggest that the past vegetation-climate interactions in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and provide a valuable reference for modeling future vegetation responses in alpine ecosystems.

Those populations have been able to withstand the Holocene desertization of the Sahara due to the existence of a number of ponds (gueltas in Arabic) which are formed after the monsoon summer rains and which are interconnected through a number of either transient or permanent water bodies forming the Gabou Lake Basin. These wetlands, without any protection to the moment, constitute the base of the more than forty thousands Tagant inhabitants economy, mainly based in the livestock and a poor agriculture. Aware of the important naturalistic potential of the zone, the Government of Mauritania, asked our NGO to prepare a candidature for the Ramsar wetlands Convention (UNESCO), in order to achieve its international knowledge and protection status.

In this paper we argue that the organization of work in fisheries on Lake Victoria, both now and in the past, encourages patterns of sexual behavior among men and women involved in fishing, trading, and servicing the industry which over the last 20 years has promoted the spread of the HIV among those working in fisheries. We use a case study of a family, Kiwanuka's, to illustrate how patterns of behavior practiced in the past (by Kiwanuka) have much more disastrous consequences now (for his children) because of the existence of HIV. Kiwanuka was a fisherman on Lake Victoria during the 1960s. During that time fish were plentiful and he earned enough to purchase land and establish himself as a coffee farmer. Two of his sons are currently employed as daily laborers at the lake. They complain of poor fish catches and their inability to make money. One daughter, who is HIV-positive, is a dried fish trader. This family's experience illustrates the far-reaching effects of economic and health conditions generated by the fishing industry on distant rural areas and across generations. Rising HIV rates are severely affecting fishers and related occupations already hit by falling fish stocks. The findings show how the same patterns of sexual behavior and wealth generation practiced by the older generation in their youth now represent a deadly risk to their children, a population in urgent need of better access to treatment, prevention, and care.					; Seeley, Janet/B-4467-2013	Grosskurth, Heiner/0000-0001-9960-7280; Seeley, Janet/0000-0002-0583-5272													0883-024X	1548-1417				FAL	2009	30	2					66	76		10.1111/j.1548-1417.2009.01022.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1548-1417.2009.01022.x													WOS:000217376900004
J	Schwalb, A; Dean, WE				Schwalb, A; Dean, WE			Reconstruction of hydrological changes and response to effective moisture variations from North-Central USA lake sediments	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Ratios of the stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon in benthic ostracodes and marl from cores taken from two lakes in north-central Minnesota reflect Holocene hydrological and vegetation changes. Oxygen isotopes show that Williams and Shingobee Lakes, located in the same watershed but with different positions along a hydrologic gradient, were connected before 9.8 ka as part of a larger lake, Lake Willobee. From 9.8-7.7 ka, the level of Lake Willobee fell as a result of glacial retreat and increasing evaporation, leaving small separated basins. Further decreases in lake level after 7.7 ka due to increasing aridity triggered the inflow of ground water in Williams Lake at about 7 ka, and in Shingobee Lake at about 5 ka. After 4 ka effective moisture increased. The carbon-isotope record reflects changes in vegetation with higher delta(13)C values during the prairie period (7.7-4 ka) and lower values during preceding and succeeding forest periods. The differences in timing of hydrological events show that the biotic and geochemical response of the lakes to climate variations is mediated by their hydrologic systems. The response may be strongly spatially heterogeneous and can result in contrasting information from geochemical and biotic proxies from the same paleorecord. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Spawning lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) and their habitat characteristics in Rainy River, Ontario and Minnesota	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) spawning habitat in the Rainy River was studied in light of the ongoing review of the rules governing water levels upstream that affect discharge rates through the International Falls dam. The objectives of this study were to assess the current status of spawning Lake Sturgeon below the dam by: (i) evaluating weight-length relationships, condition, age and growth; (ii) identifying spawning locations and characterizing its physical attributes; and, (iii) evaluating the effects of water surface elevation on the availability of spawning habitat. Spawning was confirmed with use of egg mats, and targeted sampling of spawning individuals was completed using gillnets and electrofishing. Physical attributes of spawning locations, including temperature, depth and water velocity were collected at a range of water levels using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler and representative sediment sampling. Biological characteristics and timing of spawning events were consistent with those previously reported for Lake Sturgeon. However, a wider range of depths (0.3-10.5m) and velocities (0.01-1.9m(3)/s) than reported in most single site studies was found here, with the ranges encompassing what is reported in the literature as a whole. Lake Sturgeon were found to prefer coarse spawning substrates dominated by bedrock, boulder or cobble. The availability of preferred spawning habitat varied significantly with the changing water levels observed during the study and was eventually limited at higher water levels by river channel form. Because of the implications for dewatering of nest sites, keeping flows constant during spawning is critical to Rainy River Lake Sturgeon spawning success.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				JUN	2017	33	3					328	337		10.1111/jai.13372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13372													WOS:000401429400003
J	Brothers, S; Sibley, P				Brothers, Soren; Sibley, Paul			Light may have triggered a period of net heterotrophy in Lake Superior	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent studies of Lake Superior, the Earth's largest freshwater lake by surface area, describe it as net heterotrophic (primary production < community respiration), making it a net source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. This conclusion is largely based on measurements made between 1998 and 2001. We present a long-term (1968-2016) analysis of ice-free (April-November) surface oxygen (O-2) saturation data collected by monitoring agencies. These data indicate that Lake Superior's surface waters are typically supersaturated with dissolved O-2 from May to September (May-September mean is 103.5% +/- 0.6%; pooled mean from April, October, and November is 97.6% +/- 1.1%, standard error of the mean). However, these data also support prior studies which describe a state of net heterotrophy from 1998 to 2001. We investigated potential triggers for a transient heterotrophic period and discuss the sources of organic carbon necessary to fuel net heterotrophy in a large oligotrophic lake. We conclude that net heterotrophy likely resulted from an increase in light period and penetration driven by declines in cloud cover, increases in water clarity, and a reduction of winter ice cover following the 1997-1998 El Nino. Together, these could have depleted a pre-existing pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via photomineralization and/or photochemical degradation. Our results indicate that Lake Superior is typically net autotrophic (calculated annual CO2 influx = similar to 0.4 Tg C). These results highlight how water clarity and aquatic DOC pools may interact to induce net metabolic shifts in large oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems.					; Brothers, Soren/AAE-9584-2019	Sibley, Paul/0000-0002-2622-266X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2018	63	4					1785	1798		10.1002/lno.10808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10808													WOS:000440928800022

Although mating strains were established from each locale, emphasis was shifted toward developing permanent colonies from Dryden Lake, New York, USA and Warm Springs, Georgia, USA. The net reproductive rate (Ro) was computed for the parental, F1 and F2 generations of each strain to assess the effects of colonization through successive generations. Ro increased rapidly for both strains from parental (range of 0.34-3.5) through F2 generations (range of 16.2-21.6). Analysis of Ro components indicated that the increases in Ro were the result of 2 parameters that reflect the propensity of flies to mate in confinement, suggesting that selection for mating is rapid. Multiple regression analysis indicated no significant differences between strains or generations when tested against fecundity (range of 391-519) and survival of immatures (range of 90.3-97.2%). A slight positive correlation (regression coefficient of 0.0016, P < .01) was observed between larval density (range of 284-4439 larvae/rearing) and survival of immatures, suggesting that the limits of the rearing system with regard to crowding were not approached. Both strains readily adapt to the laboratory and are currently in the 5th generation.

J	Aydan, Ö; Ulusay, R; Kumsar, H				Aydan, Oemer; Ulusay, Resat; Kumsar, Halil			Seismic, ground motion and geotechnical characteristics of the 2011 Van-Ercis and Van-Edremit earthquakes of Turkey, and assessment of geotechnical damages	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Two devastating earthquakes with moment magnitudes of 7.2 and 5.6 occurred on October 23, 2011 (Van-ErciAY earthquake) and November 9, 2011 (Van-Edremit earthquake), respectively, in the Van Province of the eastern Turkey. The Van-ErciAY and Van-Edremit earthquakes caused 604 and 38 fatalities, respectively, and heavy damage to buildings and other structures, particularly in ErciAY town and Van City. In this study, characteristics of both main shocks and their geotechnical aspects, such as local site conditions, liquefaction phenomena and associated ground deformations and slope failures are evaluated. The failures of slopes and embankments and rock falls and ground liquefaction may also be indications of diluted ground deformation caused by the earthquake fault. It seems that a wedge-like body bounded by two fault planes was uplifted. As a result of this movement, the northern shoreline of Van Lake uplifted. The November 9, 2011 Van-Edremit earthquake was triggered due to the variation of crustal stresses induced by the October 23, 2011 earthquake. The effects of local site conditions have contributed to the damage of some parts of ErciAY city and its vicinity; however, the ground liquefaction was not observed in the city as anticipated. With a magnitude of 5.6, the Van-Edremit earthquake is probably the smallest magnitude earthquake to cause liquefaction in Turkey so far.																			1435-9529	1435-9537				MAY	2014	73	2			SI		643	666		10.1007/s10064-013-0526-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10064-013-0526-z													WOS:000335156900030

Population dynamics of muskellunge in Wisconsin waters of Green Bay, Lake Michigan, 1989-2005	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Muskellunge, Esox masquinongy, were an important component of the Green Bay ecosystem prior to mid 1900s, but were extirpated by over-fishing, pollution, habitat degradation, and the introduction of exotic species. The Green Bay ecosystem improved after the passage of the Clean Water Act, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WI DNR) started a muskellunge reintroduction program in 1989. Monitoring the results of reintroduction efforts is necessary to achieve the program goal of establishing a self-sustaining population. We used available data to provide a 2005 spawner abundance estimate for a Green Bay tributary, estimates of contributions to that spawning stock from fall fingerling and yearling stocking, a weight-length relationship, a growth analysis, and a description of size and age at maturity. Our results indicate that stocking efforts have been successful in producing an adult population, with yearlings contributing to the spawning stock at a higher proportion than fingerlings (14.69:1). Our weight-length and growth analyses suggest that Green Bay muskellunge are unlikely to reach record length, but that it is possible for females to achieve record weight. The rapid growth of Green Bay muskellunge results in their maturing at larger sizes than other stocks, but the relationship between age and maturity is not well understood. Reintroduction efforts in Green Bay have created stocked populations capable of supporting trophy fisheries, but evidence of successful natural reproduction has not been observed. Future research should focus on the reproductive requirements of muskellunge reintroduced into altered habitats.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	2007	79	1-2					27	36		10.1007/s10641-006-9132-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9132-2													WOS:000245869600004

A thorough investigation involved examining 119 lakes and 12 rivers within the region. The study revealed that the annual river flow into the Karaganda lakes and their subsequent outflow from the territory was notably meager, accounting for only 0.935% and 3.031%, respectively, primarily due to the scarcity of water bodies in the region. As for water quality, none of the lakes qualify as "highly suitable water" (>50), necessitating further treatment to make them drinkable. Only a small fraction, 4.6% of the lakes, display water quality scores ranging from 50 to 100, indicating the urgent need for substantial remediation efforts. Additionally, a considerable proportion, 47.7% of the lakes, fell within the water quality range of 100-200, demanding treatment before appropriate use. Furthermore, a noteworthy 11% of the lakes were deemed "unsuitable for drinking" (>300), while 36.7% are classified as "very poor water" in the range of 200-300. In the context of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), the aspects of stakeholder participation, ecosystem protection, and water quality management received the least favorable evaluations, with an average score ranging from 2.4 to 2.8.

J	Wang, HL; Zheng, MP; Yuan, HR				Wang, Hailei; Zheng Mianping; Yuan Heran			Highstands in the interior of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau since the last interglacial: evidence from grain-size analysis of lacustrine core sediments in Zabuye Salt Lake	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Highstands in the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 based on C-14 dating in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) are widely documented. Recent records from shoreline sediments dated using U-series and/or optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), however, reveal that the highstands originally dated in MIS 3 should now be considered to fall in MIS 5. This paper provides new evidence from the interior of the QTP, based on the grain-size from a continuous lake core in the Zabuye Salt Lake, to verify the MIS 5 highstand in the QTP. Grain-size analysis of the core sediments also distinguishes two other highstands in MIS 3 and MIS 2, respectively. The MIS 5 highstand is considered as the maximum lake level since the Last Interglacial, as cored sediments contain very low values of Median Diameter (Md) during MIS 5. Compared with the discontinuous records from lake shorelines sediments, the grain-size records from the continuous lake centre core sediments provide a more complete dataset to infer lake level variations, and make it possible to make wider palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental interpretation. In the interior of the QTP, highstands might have continued into cold climate periods due to the reduced evaporation rates in the latter. The influence of the moisture-bearing southerly-shifted Westerly wind pathway may also have contributed to the highstands in the glacial period.

Three Strigeid cercariae from Littorina littorea snail, Qarun Lake, Fayoum, Egypt	VETERINARY WORLD												Aim: The present study aims to focus on the role of common marine snails Littorina, littorea) as a vector for some trematode parasites. Materials and Methods: A total of 327 marine water L. littorea snails were collected during the summer of 2016 from a Qarun lake in the EL-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt. The snails were investigated for infection by trematode parthenitae through induction of cercarial shedding by exposure to light and crushing the snails. The species were stored in Search Laboratory of Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Fayoum University. Results: Three species of Strigeid littorina cercaria were identified from the infected snails. They are described here and they identified in relation to close-up morphological features and linked to its snail hosts. They give the following names. Cercaria strigeld littorina type 1, C strigeid littorina type 2, and C. strigeld littorina type 3. The incidence of infection by these cercariae was 33%, 25.7%, and 2.4%, respectively. Conclusion: This study is clarifying the importance of this marine snail as intermediate hosts for new trematode species.

J	LIVINGSTONE, DM; IMBODEN, DM				LIVINGSTONE, DM; IMBODEN, DM			THE NONLINEAR INFLUENCE OF WIND-SPEED VARIABILITY ON GAS TRANSFER IN LAKES	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												The analytical representation of wind-speed probabilities by the Weibull distribution allows the empirical characterization of a scalar wind field on the basis of two Weibull parameters. Such a parameterization obviates the necessity of including wind data in time-series form explicitly in air-water interaction models when accounting for non-linear wind effects. By combining the Weibull wind-speed distribution with commonly employed trilinear and power-law expressions for the dependence of the gas transfer velocity on wind speed, analytical expressions for the mean value of the transfer velocity are obtained. These expressions predict the non-linearity of the dependence of gas transfer velocity on wind speed to be responsible for an increase in the mean transfer velocity which will normally not exceed 100% of the value obtained when non-linear wind effects are neglected. In the specific case of the winter oxygenation of a typical subalpine Swiss lake (Aegerisee), the commonly employed trilinear and power-law expressions are found to underestimate the mean O2 transfer velocity considerably. It is evident that such expressions cannot be employed to determine gas transfer velocities in sheltered lakes without considerable modification at low wind speeds. The extent of the modification required, however, suggests that the role played by the instantaneous wind speed in determining the gas transfer velocity in such lakes may be much less significant than is usually assumed.																			0280-6509					JUL	1993	45	3					275	295		10.1034/j.1600-0889.1993.t01-2-00005.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0889.1993.t01-2-00005.x													WOS:A1993LP57900005
J	Estrum-Yousef, SR; Schoor, A				Estrum-Yousef, SR; Schoor, A			Seasonal variation of nitrogen transformations in the pelagial of selected nearshore waters of the Baltic Sea with emphasis on the particulate pool	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Physical and chemical conditions, particulate matter and N-uptake were characterized at two sampling sites at the eastern German coast of the Baltic Sea (Pomeranian Bay) over the annual period of 1997 (February-November). The inshore sampling sites (5 m water depth) differed with respect to the potential influences of river run-off and salt water exchange (mean values of salinity: 7.05 and 8.72 PSU), respectively. The mean org-C-diss/org-C-part-ratios (4.9 and 12.6) fell in the same order of magnitude (1.0-12.6) as values of neighboring inshore waters, and increasing values reflect an enhancement of the trophic level. Beside differences of nitrogen concentrations (dissolved inorganic nitrogen: 1.8-23.8 and 0.9-9.9 mu mol l(-1)), particulate nitrogen (4.30-41.01 and 2.69-9.08 mu mol l(-1)) and absolute uptake of N-nutrients (mean sum of NH4+, urea, NO3- uptake rates: 0.141 and 0.087 mu mol l(-1) h(-1)), specific uptake of N-15-labelled nutrients (NH4+, urea, NO3-) as well as the relationships between the measured variables characterize distinguishable inshore systems. The high variability at the shallow sampling sites prevents, however a simple resolution of the seasonal courses. Light dose could be identified as a potential key in order to describe long-term variations of N-uptake at the station with higher organic matter concentration (station KW), but phytoplankton development is better reflected in the seasonal course of N-uptake at the other station. Specific nitrogen uptake rates (NH4+: 0.0009-0.0353 h(-1), urea: 0.0001-0.0137 h(-1), NO3-: 0.000004-0.0009 h(-1)) and relative nitrogen preferences indicate extraordinary importance of reduced nitrogenous nutrients (NH4+, urea) at both stations throughout the year.																			0018-8158					MAY	2001	450	1-3					19	30		10.1023/A:1017521400253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017521400253													WOS:000170963600003

During this period, there were 60 regional extreme low temperature events (ERLTEs), which are included in the 690 regional low temperature events (RLTEs). The 60 ERLTEs are analyzed in this paper. The results show that in the last 50 years, the intensity of the ERLTEs has become weak; the number of lasted days has decreased; and, the affected area has become small. However, that situation has changed in this century. In terms of spatial distribution, the high intensity regions are mainly in Northern China while the high frequency regions concentrate in Central and Eastern China. According to the affected area of each event, the 60 ERLTEs are classified into six types. The atmospheric circulation background fields which correspond to these types are also analyzed. The results show that, influenced by stronger blocking highs of Ural and Lake Baikal, as well as stronger southward polar vortex and East Asia major trough at 500-hPa geopotential height, cold air from high latitudes is guided to move southward and abnormal northerly winds at 850 hPa makes the cold air blow into China along diverse paths, thereby forming different types of regional extreme low temperatures in winter.

J	STEVENS, RJJ; NEILSON, MA				STEVENS, RJJ; NEILSON, MA			INTERLAKE AND INTRALAKE DISTRIBUTIONS OF TRACE ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS IN SURFACE WATERS OF THE GREAT-LAKES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorobenzenes (di- to hexa-) were determined on large volume surface water samples collected throughout Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Superior in the spring of 1986. Analysis of variance revealed that all trace organic contaminants exhibited significant (p < 0.05) differences between lakes. Chlorobenzenes, being derived from ongoing manufacturing and usage, exhibited highest concentrations in the lower lakes while those compounds whose principal source is atmospheric deposition displayed no discernable distribution patterns. Lake Ontario could be considered the most heavily impacted of the lakes as it ranked highest in mean concentration for all chlorobenzenes, PCBs, lindane, endrin, and p,p''-DDE. Determinants of large-scale spatial patterns of contaminants varied between lakes. Minor north-south gradients in contaminant concentrations in Lake Superior appeared largely a function of differences in atmospheric loading. In contrast, large gradients were evident in Lake Erie, a result of numerous tributary point sources, particularly in the western basin. Spatial distribution of contaminants in lake Huron resulted primarily from inputs from Saginaw Bay, the Serpent-Spanish rivers, and the Black River/Lake Michigan at the Straits of Mackinac. The Niagara River was the most important determinant of spatial patterns of contaminants in Lake Ontario, especially with respect to the chlorobenzenes. Dramatic increases in the concentrations of chlorobenzenes were observed between eastern Lake Erie and the Niagara river plume in Lake Ontario.																			0380-1330						1989	15	3					377	393		10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71494-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71494-5													WOS:A1989AR71000002

Two and three dimensional inversion of the ERT data images the F0 fumarole as a low resistivity (2-5 Omega m) feature reflecting the two-phase zone surrounding the single phase vapour conduit. Crucially, interpretation of the inversion images is well constrained by a large existing dataset of rock electrical properties, including surface conductivity, porosity and intrinsic formation factor, alongside new measurements of liquid phase electrical conductivity taken from a range of hot-springs on the island. Pore-filling liquids are an order of magnitude more conductive than sea-water with their low to very low pH (3.4 to -03) contributing to their extremely conductive nature. An extensive low-resistivity feature (0.2 Omega m) at similar to 125 m depth is therefore interpreted as a liquid saturated layer exposed to hydrothermal alteration by acid fluids. The intersection of the F0 fumarole trace with this layer is coincident with a previously determined source of deformation, suggesting that heat transport inside the fumarole conduit pressurises surrounding liquid and vapour filled pore space, generating the deformation signal. The timeseries of fumarolic and plume emissions in the year prior to the ERT survey show that the gases transported by the fumarole are a mixture of high temperature magmatic vapour and lower temperature gas equilibrated within the hydrothermal environment. Interpretation of the gas data suggests that the snapshot captured by the ERT image shows the single-phase vapour and two-phase vapourliquid regions adjacent to the conduit were likely at close to their smallest extent, consisting of mostly hydrothermal derived gases.

The Lake Natron Footprint Tuff (northern Tanzania): volcanic source, depositional processes and age constraints from field relations	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The Engare Sero Footprint Site, situated on the southern shore of Lake Natron in northern Tanzania, has been reported to host one of the best preserved sets of fossilized hominid footprints in the world. However, until now there has been no detailed characterization and age determination of the footprint-bearing strata (the Footprint Tuff). Here, we combine field observations with geochemical and mineralogical analyses and measurements of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility to constrain depositional processes, the role of reworking and the volcanic source for the Footprint Tuff. We find that the footprint-bearing horizon consists of volcanic ash-fall that has been slightly reworked by water, and that this was produced during a voluminous eruption of the Oldoinyo Lengai volcano. The unit, which covered the footprints and helped to preserve them, consists of the wind-blown material from the same eruption, mixed together with locally derived detrital material. We can constrain the ash horizon to be of Holocene age, based on: (i) the location of the Footprint Tuff within the regional stratigraphy, (ii) previous age determination of an ash layer that can be correlated with the Footprint Tuff and (iii) the regional climatological history of the area. The ash horizon was probably deposited around 11000-10500 years ago, but could potentially be even younger than this.

J	Pearsall, WH				Pearsall, WH			Biological survey of the River Wharfe - Introduction	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The River Wharfe, Yorkshire, is practically unpolluted, and flows through mountain limestone, millstone grit and magnesian limestone. The observing and collecting stations at Grassington, Pool and Ulleskelf represent conditions at these 3 main stages of its course. Observations from June 1926 to Nov. 1927 showed suspended solids were usually less than 1 part per 100,000; nitrite occurred in measurable quantity only between June and Sept. at Pool, and between June and Oct. at Ulleskelf; ammoniacal N reached 0.008 p.p. 100,000 in April at Ulleskelf. A brownish coloration due to peat occurred in Aug. and Sept. each year, resulting in high O-absorption and organic nitrogen figures. The O content of the water never fell below 79.8% saturation. There was never any striking depletion of either phosphates, nitrates, or silica, as in lakes. The water was "slightly hard" (Thresh). The invertebrate fauna (except Protozoa, Nematoda and Rotifera) varied with the nature of the stream-bed and the rate of current. At Grassington and Pool the fauna was that of rapid water, but at Ulleskelf bivalves and gastropods predominated. In general, there was no marked seasonal change in the specific nature of the fauna, and variations in the character of fauna were largely related to length of life cycle, duration of period of maturity, and to current changes causing disturbances and translocation of organisms. The phytoplankton collections made from June to Sept. 1926 consisted mainly of vegetable debris and animal excrement, together with fragments of filamentous algae, and small diatoms. The flora appears to be mainly washings from stones and the river bed, and there were few real plankton spp. Few spp. occur all down the river; most were limited in distribution. Volvox aureus occurred at Ulleskelf in Aug. (Sept.), and Myxophyceae were more prominent here than elsewhere. At Pool, Rhizoclonium was abundant in June, and Spirogyra in July.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1930	18						273	273		10.2307/2256006	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2256006													WOS:000200121400013
J	Meng, J; Zhou, YQ; Liu, SF; Chen, SQ; Wang, TY				Meng, Jing; Zhou, Yunqiao; Liu, Sifan; Chen, Shuqin; Wang, Tieyu			Increasing perfluoroalkyl substances and ecological process from the Yongding Watershed to the Guanting Reservoir in the Olympic host cities, China	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have raised great attention, particularly in regions of rapid urbanization. Zhangjiakou and Beijing will jointly host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022, which will likely increase local PFASs pollution and their associated risks over the coming period. In this study, we identified ecological process of PFASs, including sources, environmental fate, and risks, from the Yongding Watershed to the Guanting Reservoir. The concentrations of total 12 PFASs in water of the Guanting Reservoir were higher than that from the Yongding Watershed, with mean of 48.9 and 33.7 ng/L, respectively. The concentrations of PFASs in sediment of the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir were similar, with mean of 1.01 and 0.827 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Detected levels of PFASs in the Guanting Reservoir significantly increased during the past eight years, possibly due to an improving economy and a rapidly developed service industry. Moderate PFASs levels in fish of the Guanting Reservoir were detected relative to other lakes and reservoirs. The daily intake of PFASs via fish and water ranged from 4.96 to 15.0 ng/kg bw/day, with higher levels found in children relative to adults. In total, approximately 9.06 kg of PFASs from riverine flow and atmospheric deposition annually entered the Guanting Reservoir. PFASs from the Yongding River significantly contributed to the pollution of Guanting Reservoir, with predominance of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) in water, and long-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in sediment in both the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir. Most of the PFASs (23.5 kg) were stored in water of the Guanting Reservoir, while the annual storage of PFASs in sediment and fish was only 4.68 x 10(-2) kg and 4.36 x 10(-2) kg via deposition and accumulation, respectively. The results suggest that water quality management of the Yongding Watershed is necessary for effective control on PFASs pollution in the Guanting Reservoir.

The framework utilizes benefit transfer policy analysis to provide a practical procedure for estimating the effectiveness of recreational water quality policies. Evaluation criteria include the rates of intended and unintended management outcomes, whether the chosen protocols generate closures with positive net economic benefits to swimmers, and the number of predicted illnesses the policy is able to prevent. We demonstrate the framework through a case study of a Lake Michigan freshwater beach using existing water quality and visitor data from 1998 to 2001. We find that a typical closure causes a net economic loss among would-be swimmers totaling $1274-37 030/day, depending on the value assumptions used. Unnecessary closures, caused by high indicator variability and a 24-h time delay between when samples are taken and the management decision can be made, occurred on 14 (12%) out of 118 monitored summer days. Days with high FIB levels when the swim area is open are also common but do relatively little economic harm in comparison. Also, even if the closure policy could be implemented daily and perfectly without error, only about 42% of predicted illnesses would be avoided. These conclusions were sensitive to the relative values and risk preferences that swimmers have for recreation access and avoiding health effects, suggesting a need for further study of the impacts of recreational water quality policies on individuals.																			0013-936X					MAY 15	2004	38	10					2737	2745		10.1021/es034905z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es034905z								15212245					WOS:000221502800009

We have obtained pollen spectra from speleothems collected from caves in the Somali-Chalbi and Kalahari deserts suggesting that these deposits may be an important future source of desert paleovegetation data. As cave spleothems can be dated by the 230Th/234U method to c. 350,000 yr B.P., and by the TL and ESR methods potentially to 1 m.y. B.P., and can sometimes give paleotemperature and paleohydrologic data, they could provide a first glimpse of desert paleoenvironments using isotope stages 4-9. Ages of speleothems for the Chihuahuan, Kalahari, and Somali-Chalbi deserts suggests that there was more available moisture in the southwestern U.S.A. and in northwestern Botswana during glacials and interstadials of the last c. 300,000 years, but that wetter conditions in the Horn of Africa corresponded with interglacials and perhaps to a lesser extent with interstadials. Pollen from three northern Somalia speleothems indicate more mesic conditions in the Horn of Africa at 10,000, 11,800, and 176,500 yr B.P., while speleothem pollen spectra from Matupi Cave in northeastern Zaire, presently surrounded by tropical rainforest, suggest a savanna grassland at this cave c. 14,000 yr B.P.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN	1990	76	3-4					311	329		10.1016/0031-0182(90)90118-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(90)90118-Q													WOS:A1990CM50500007

These minerotrophic patterned peatlands are presently affected by erosion processes, expressed by progressive mechanical destruction of their pools borders. This erosion process is related to a water table rise induced by a regional increase of humidity since the last century. The main objective of the present paper is to (1) evaluate if Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating techniques can be applied to build accurate chronologies in these environments and (2) detect changes in the peat accumulation rates in regard to this amplification of humidity. In both sites, unsupported Pb-210 shows all exponential decreasing according to the depth. Chronologies inferred from Pb-210 allow to reconstruct peat accumulation rates since ca. 1855 AD. The Cs-137 data displayed evident mobility and diffusion, preventing the establishment of any sustained chronology based on these measurements. In the two sites, peat accumulation rates inferred from Pb-210 chronologies fluctuate between 0.005 and 0.038 g cm(-2) yr(-1). As a result, the rise of the water table during the last decade has not yet affected peat accumulation rates. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the distribution characteristics of anammox bacteria are not adequately described in the riparian sediment of urban rivers. Therefore, the distribution characteristics of anammox bacteria of Guyun river riparian sediment, which is the representative urban river, were investigated in this study. Research results showed that anammox bacterial abundance showed a significant spatial variation at the study area. Abundance values ranged from 2.00 x 10(5) to 1.92 x 10(7) copies center dot g(-1) dry sediment. And the average value was 6.64x10(6) copies center dot g(-1) dry sediment in six collected samples. Abundance of anammox bacteria was significantly related to TN, NH4+-N, and pH. Slight spatial variations of richness and diversity in Guyun river riparian sediment were obtained and physicochemical parameters of sediment samples did not significantly influence the biodiversity index of anammox bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all amplified sequences fell within the known anammox bacterial group, i.e., Brocadia, Anammoxoglobus/Jettenia, and Kuenenia, with proportions of 33.91%, 24.35%, and 41.74%, respectively. The relative abundance of anammox bacteria showed distinctive spatial heterogeneity in six different sample sites. This finding indicated a distinct spatial variation of anammox bacterial in Guyun river riparian sediment.																			0149-0451	1521-0529				MAR 16	2019	36	3					243	250		10.1080/01490451.2018.1545268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2018.1545268													WOS:000461644000006

Although the lake has a productive fishery, water quality and aquatic habitat are affected by nutrient loading, algal blooms, and extensive oxygen depletion in the bottom waters. The main objectives were to characterize habitat availability and predict the implications of a change in phosphorus loading from the Saluda and Reedy rivers. The baseline scenario of the model showed that habitat was most critical during July and August, when as little of 5% of the reservoir contained tolerable habitat (temperature <28 degrees C and dissolved oxygen >2 mg/L). Favorable habitat (temperature <25 degrees C and dissolved oxygen >2 mg/L) was usually absent for most of July and August. Pulses of higher inflow or freshets produced short-term increases in tolerable habitat, especially in the upper end of the reservoir. Phosphorus-loading scenarios predicted that large reductions (50% or more) would be required to improve habitat substantially during midsummer. For the manager of a striped bass fishery, water quality models can be useful tools for evaluating habitat, especially under marginal conditions, and for predicting the impact of altered water management practices.

Samples from ten distinct irrigation systems used in vegetable cultivation, from five distinct streams, from two reservoirs, from one artificial lake, and from three distinct springs were analyzed. All isolates were serotyped and tested for hemolysin, cytotoxin, heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins production; presence of plasmid; autoagglutination and drug resistance. V. cholerae isolates were also tested for cholera enterotoxin (CT) production, and Aeromonas isolates for suicide phenomenon. No P. shigelloides was found. V. cholerae non 01 was found in five irrigation water samples and in three stream samples. Aeromonas sp. were isolated in two samples of irrigation water, in three streams, and in one reservoir. All the V. cholerae and Aeromonas isolates were positive for P-hemolysin production, and all Aeromonas isolates were positive for suicide phenomenon; cytotoxic activities were observed in two Aeromonas strains. Cholera enterotoxin was not found in eight V. cholerae non-01 isolates tested by the Y-1 mouse adrenal cell. All isolates were also negative for the other virulence markers.

A free-fall microstructure profiler (TurboMAP) and a fine-scale profiler (F-probe) were deployed. An array of five ADCPs positioned close to the experiment site provided current measurements associated with the internal-wave field for a period of one week. Strong winds related to the passage of a typhoon close to the lake generated two low-frequency internal waves: a Kelvin wave and an inertial wave. Both waves were in the first baroclinic mode. This study pictures the superposition of two large-scale internal waves and a stronger current resulting from the two waves being in phase. The synchronization of the waves provoked enhanced shear in the hypolimnion, more than 10 m above the bottom, as well as high dissipation (10(-7) W kg(-1)) and vertical diffusivity reaching 10(-4) m(2) s(-1). The enhanced shear event seems to be related to the current amplitude since it occurred when the current amplitude was increased by the diel wind. Assuming the same turbulence intensity for the enhanced hypolimnetic shear events, this superposition may affect nutrient transfer in the hypolimnion. Also, we witnessed sediment resuspension, consisting of high turbidity and high fluorescence intensity, likely due to a combination of bottom stress and enhanced turbulence.

Shortcomings of such an approach include the validation at only one geographic location without explicitly accounting for variable hydrologic patterns within the watershed. Our objective was to conduct a spatially distributed calibration and validation of water flow using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We simulated surface, groundwater, and total flow in the Sandusky watershed in Ohio, located in the Lake Erie watershed and the Great Lakes basin. The calibration and validation of simulated water flow was conducted concurrently at four subwatersheds and the drainage outlet of the Sandusky watershed. We used measured streamflow data at five U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauge stations from water years 1998 and 1999 for calibration and from water years 2000 and 2001 for validation. The surface water simulations at all monitoring stations were better than the groundwater simulations. The validation of total water flow showed a range in mean error of 0.03 to 4.00 m(3) s(-1), a root mean square error of 0.06 to 2.56 m(3) s(-1), correlation coefficients of 0.70 to 0.90, and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.40 to 0.73. In conclusion, spatially distributed calibration and validation accounted for hydrologic patterns in the subwatersheds nested within the relatively large Sandusky watershed. Overall, simulations of water flow in the Sandusky watershed and subwatersheds were satisfactory except for winter rainfall-runoff events. This study showed the importance of spatially distributed calibration and validation.

Two major assemblages (I and II) were recognized, both characterized by 3 main species: Difflugia oblonga, Lagenodifflugia vas, and Pontigulasia compressa. Assemblage I is divided into 5 sub-assemblages characterized by occurrences of minor species. Assemblage II basically has only 3 species with low abundances. The assemblage variations within Assemblage I are difficult to link with specific variables since relatively little is known about individual species. Individual occurrences of 2 spp. can be linked to specific conditions: Difflugia bidens relates to increased sediment input and Difflugia tricuspis occurs with high concentrations of floating algae. The division between Assemblage I and II appears to be a function of seasonal temperatures. The high diversity Assemblage I occurs where summer temperatures reach values greater than 18.degree. C (that is, above the thermocline) while Assemblage II occurs below the thermocline where temperatures do not exceed 6.degree. C. O2 values in both assemblages are the same and, as in Lake Erie, low O2 values do not appear to be a limiting factor. To complement the surface studies, cores from 6 of these lakes were also examined. Most lakes were formerly marine basins when sea level was much higher and the marine freshwater transition demonstrated the sharpest assemblage changes. Centropyxis aculeata usually dominated the transition sections. Arcellacean assemblages illustrated few changes once freshwater conditions were established in New Brunswick even though climatic changes are known in the same interval. Assemblages in the Nova Scotia lakes changed sharply below the surface with D. tricuspis becoming much more common; this indicates more floating algae in these lakes in pre-modern times.

Past and present landscapes of the Kimmes-Tobin Mitigated Wetlands, Foxboro, Douglas County, Wisconsin	WULFENIA												The study area was 190 hectares of reconstructed wetlands, located on Hilpiper and county Road C in Foxboro, Douglas County, Wisconsin. It was a devastated area that has been reconstructed, following a long history as a cleared grazing and haying farm. The site was a wetland creation project, which relies on surface drainage and rainfall over Substrate with a low infiltration rate. The site was revegetated by natural reseeding except for some planting of the berm with Phalaris arundinacea by the Department of Transportation (DOT). In December 1997, scrub shrub, wet meadow, shallow marsh, deep marsh, and aquatic bed species all were present and mapped. A total of 1 1 1 taxa were found in the wetland cells during the Study of Kimmes-Tobin from 1993 to 1997. Three plant species tended to dominate the approximately three-foot transition between standing water and the construction berm: Typha latifolia, Scirpus cyperinus and Phalaris arundinacea. Sampling was carried out during the height of the growing season, in mid to late July of 1993 to the fall of 1997. Transect quadrats were used to obtain vegetation data. The final wetland delineation acreage was 69.2 hectares on the 190 hectares property. This land was used to replace wetlands destroyed by the construction of highways. Acreage left over was banked for use by DOT, for impacts within the Lake Superior watershed. It was concluded from the prevalence indices and weighted averages calculated from transect data chat there was high probability (WA < 2.0) that the area meets hydrophytic criteria, as only two cells had a PI or WA that was over the 2.0 limit. It is concluded from these results that the vegetation objectives of the mature wetland, Sought by the DOT and requested of Donald W.

J	Shaw, PA; Bateman, MD				Shaw, Paul A.; Bateman, Mark D.			Provenance and chronology of the Barcavecchia Tufa, Southwest Etna, Sicily	BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA												The palaeoenvironmental history of a similar to 0.1 km 2 delta-shaped tufaceous spring mound at Barcavecchia, on the southwest flank of Etna, is investigated using biota assay, sedimentology and geochemistry. Dating control has been provided by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The Barcavecchia sediments, comprising a lower lacustrine unit, and an upper marsh unit, provide a late Quaternary history of local conditions following drainage disruption of the Simeto river by hawaiite lavas and the outflow of carbonate rich groundwater from the Adrano Escarpment after 24 ka. Initially a small, saline lake formed before 17 ka, which dried out around 14 ka leaving a depositional hiatus. Subsequent sedimentation in a saline marsh environment preserved a sequence of tephra layers of local, hawaiite origin, of which the lowest (and thickest) was deposited between 8-6 ka, coincident with the recurrent activity of the Leone eruptive center. The upper sections preserve further tephra layers and a discontinuous pollen record, and probably terminates around 3-2 ka. These ages accord well with those obtained by Romano et alii (1987) from radiometric dating. The Holocene vegetation of the site mirrors that of the contemporary upper marsh although tree species largely disappeared in the late Holocene.						bateman, mark/0000-0003-1756-6046													0037-8763						2006	125	3					265	272																WOS:000241883600001

The fi rst stage began during the Nipissing transgression, similar to 6.0 ka, and culminated at the Nipissing high, similar to 4.5 ka. Rising lake levels eroded the lake margins and generated sediment that was transported to southern Lake Michigan, creating the Tolleston barrier beach. The second stage, beginning similar to 4.5 ka with a rapid lake level fall and continuing to similar to 3.0 ka, represents a major episode of transgressive parabolic dune field development. Large, simple parabolic dunes, with easterly apices (85-105 degrees azimuth) suggestive of westerly wind formation, developed in a sand belt similar to 1-2 km wide. The third stage, from similar to 3.0 to 1.0 ka, was characterized by strandplain progradation and transverse ridge development west of Miller, Indiana, and dune stabilization creating the Holland Paleosol east of Miller. Sporadic blowout activity from strong westerly winds redistributed the sand within the dune fi eld, amalgamating simple dune forms into compound, rake-like, and nested parabolic dunes. The fourth and youngest stage, beginning similar to 1.0 ka, represents blowout development in a southeasterly direction (120-135 degrees azimuth), indicating a wind direction shift to the northwest. Blowouts, whether developed in transverse ridges or in the northern arms of parabolic dunes, occur closest to the lake. The timing of this blowout initiation coincides with a rise in the level of Lake Michigan. However, a more likely development and maintenance mechanism for these dunes is increased storminess with strong northerly and northwesterly winds during the cooler months of the year.

The second scenario assumes that more water could flow from the Lake Tiberias and the lower Jordan River, and that water usage in agriculture would be limited. Qualitative information from the narrative scenarios was translated into quantitative data to feed a system dynamic model that allows tracing the development until 2025. This paper presents three indicators for changes, namely the Dead Sea inflow-outflow balance, the Dead Sea water level, and the water uses in major usage sectors. The authors conclude that a more sustainable water management is possible: First, the mineral extracting industries must cease evaporating Dead Sea water. Second, the flow of the lower Jordan River must be restored to at least a third of its original flow. Third, if water from the Red Sea is brought into the region, there must be not only an environmental but also a social impact assessment.

J	Eynard, F; Mez, K; Walther, JL				Eynard, F; Mez, K; Walther, JL			Risk of cyanobacterial toxins in Riga waters (Latvia)	WATER RESEARCH												Riga, the capital of Latvia, is surrounded by several lakes. Being domestic and industrial wastewater recipients, these lakes are eutrophic. One of them, Lake Mazais Baltezers is used for artificial recharge of the groundwater (Quaternary aquifer) through infiltration basins. The water quality of this lake is crucial as the groundwater is eventually used as a source of drinking water. important cyanobacterial blooms occurred in this lake at the end of summer. These blooms were toxic and microcystin-LR was analysed in the algal biomass. Microcystins were analysed using protein phosphatase inhibition assay and high-performance liquid chromatography. Toxins were analysed in surface water samples as well as drinking water samples to assess the soil cleaning efficiency. This study showed that the Lake Mazais Baltezers was vulnerable due to human activities and its water quality could vary quickly due to cyanobacteria. The soil of this area was not efficient enough to protect the groundwater and the drinking water from toxins during the blooming period (August-September) and it appeared that toxins were not degraded in the soil, which is a cause of concern since the consumption of sub-acute levels may be deleterious to human health. The toxin concentrations indicated that, in the future, the water source should be monitored and that measures should be introduced to control blooms and to remove toxins from the water.

J	Kilgour, BW; Barton, DR				Kilgour, BW; Barton, DR			Associations between stream fish and benthos across environmental gradients in southern Ontario, Canada	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The relationship between fish and benthic invertebrate communities in wadeable streams in southern Ontario, Canada, was examined using three independent and spatially distinct data sets. 2. Associations between fish and benthos were always significant when benthos were identified to family and often at the level of phylum. Identification to genus improved the strength of the fish-benthos association in one case. In contrast, identification to species did not improve the strength of the fish-benthos association. Associations between benthos and fish were weaker for one study utilizing a 'rapid' bio-assessment protocol involving field sorting and identification, and a second study which utilized winter benthic collections. 3. In two surveys, stream temperatures were important to the distributions of both fish and benthos, while in a third survey, fish and benthos were primarily influenced by stream size. In all three studies, fish and benthos were associated with similar suites of environmental variables, suggesting that the fish-benthos associations in these streams was driven by corresponding environmental tolerances. 4. Although there was significant variation in the strength of the fish-benthos association which could be attributed to differences in sampling methodologies, the findings from the present study confirm that stream fish and benthos are significantly associated. Therefore, surveys of benthos can be used to make inferences on the condition of fish community composition.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	1999	41	3					553	566		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00402.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00402.x													WOS:000081362000007

Interaction among spring phytoplankton succession, water discharge patterns, and hydrogen peroxide dynamics in the Caloosahatchee River in southwest Florida	HARMFUL ALGAE												Phytoplankton communities are major primary producers in the aquatic realm and are responsible for shaping aquatic ecosystems. The dynamics of algal blooms could be determined by a succession of variable taxonomic groups, which are altered based on complex environmental factors such as nutrient availability and hydraulic factors. In-river structures potentially increase the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) by increasing water residence time and deteriorating water quality. How flowing water stimulates cell growth and affects the population dynamics of phytoplankton communities is a prioritized question that needs to be addressed for water management tactics. The goal of this study was to determine if an interaction between water flow and water chemistry is present, furthermore, to determine the relationship among phytoplankton community successions in the Caloosahatchee River, a subtropical river strongly influenced by human-controlled water discharge patterns from Lake Okeechobee. Particularly we focused on how phytoplankton community shifts influence the natural abundance of hydrogen peroxide, the most stable reactive oxygen species and a byproduct of oxidative photosynthesis. High-throughput amplicon sequencing using universal primers amplify 23S rRNA gene in cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algal plastids revealed that Synechococcus and Cyanobium were the dominant cyanobacterial genera and their relative abundance ranged between 19.5 and 95.3% of the whole community throughout the monitoring period. Their relative abundance declined when the water discharge increased. On the contrary, the relative abundance of eukaryotic algae sharply increased after water discharge increased. As water temperature increased in May, initially dominant Dolichospermum decreased as Microcystis increased. When Microcystis declined other filamentous cyanobacteria such as Geitlerinema, Pseudanabaena, and Prochlorothreix increased in their relative abundances. Interestingly, a peak of extracellular hydrogen peroxide was observed when Dolichospermum dominance was ended, and M. aeruginosa numbers increased. Overall, phytoplankton communities were strongly impacted by human-induced water discharge patterns.

Ciliates are a key component of subtropical and tropical microbial webs because of their role as dominant picoplankton grazers and their ability to channel picoplankton production to the uppermost trophic levels. Plankton ciliates have been found to play a crucial role in the survival of fish larvae in lakes that share several features with Lake Catemaco, a eutrophic tropical Mexican lake. Therefore, the plankton ciliate composition, abundance, and biomass of Lake Catemaco were studied to assess their role in the microbial food web. The data were obtained from surface and bottom water samples collected at eleven points during three surveys in 2011 and an additional survey in 2013, with the surveys covering the local climatic seasons. The most abundant components of the plankton ciliate assemblages were small prostomatids (Urotricha spp.), choreotrichs (Rimostrombidium spp.), cyclotrichs (Mesodinium and Askenasia), and scuticociliates (Cyclidium, Cinetochilum, Pleuronema, and Uronema). Other important ciliates in terms of abundance and/or biomass were haptorids (Actinobolina, Belonophrya, Monodinium, Paradileptus, and Laginophrya), Halteria, oligotrichs (Limnostrombidium and Pelagostrombidium), Linostomella, Bursaridium, Cyrtolophosis, and Litonotus. The ciliate abundance averaged 57 cells mL(-1) and ranged from 14 to 113 cells mL(-1). The mean ciliate biomass was 71 mu g C L-1 and ranged from 10 to 202 mu g C L-1. Differences were not detected in ciliate abundance or biomass between the sampling points or sampling depths (surface to bottom); however, significant differences were observed between seasons for both variables. Nano-sized filamentous cyanobacteria were the most abundant component of the plankton, and their abundance was assessed through epifluorescence microscopy counts. The autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton abundance was measured through epifluorescence, and their abundance and biomass were higher at the study site relative to other shallow freshwater ecosystems. The total ciliate biomass distribution patterns were similar to those of filamentous cyanobacteria and autotrophic or heterotrophic picoplankton, although the nanociliate biomasses peaked when the picoplankton and filamentous cyanobacteria were least abundant. The consequences of this increased importance of ciliates on the structure of the plankton at Lake Catemaco will be discussed along with the probable causes.

This has caused changes in vegetation communities, soil erosion, desertification and loss of carbon stocks. Little data exist regarding vegetation and ecosystems in the Icelandic highland before landnam and therefore the impact of land use over time is poorly understood. The objectives of the study are to examine the timing, nature and causes of land degradation in the highland of Northwest Iceland. Specifically, to determine the resilience of the pre-landnam highland environment to disturbances (i.e. climate cooling and volcanism) and whether land use pressure was of sufficient magnitude to facilitate ecosystem change. A sediment core was taken from the highland lake Galtabol. A chronology for the core was constructed using known tephra layers and radiocarbon dated plant macrofossils. Pollen analysis (vegetation), coprophilous fungal spores (proxy for grazing), and sediment properties (proxies for erosion) were used to provide a high-resolution, integrated vegetation and paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The pre-landnam environment showed resilience to climate cooling and repeated tephra fall. Soon after landnam the vegetation community changed and instability increased, indicated by changes in sediment properties. The pollen and spore record suggest introduction of grazing herbivores into the area after landnam. Following landnam, indicators of soil erosion appear in the sediment properties. Intensification of soil erosion occurred during the 17th century. The Galtabol record clearly demonstrates what can happen in landscapes without adequate management of natural resources and underestimation of landscape sensitivity. Introduction of land use resulted in changes in vegetation communities, loss of resilience and onset of increased soil erosion. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions may inform future decisions on management of the highland by providing baselines for natural variability in the pre-landmim environment. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

This study investigates the sources, fate, and transport of antibiotic residues in the river-reservoir system to inform strategies for mitigating their ecological impacts on water-related ecosystem. The MARINA-antibiotics (China-1.0) model (Model to Assess River Inputs of Pollutants to Seas for Antibiotics in freshwater) was adjusted for the Cirata Reservoir catchment in Indonesia and potential antibiotic pollution from aquaculture was incorporated into the model. Using this adjusted model, the inputs of 14 antibiotics from human use, livestock farming, and aquaculture were quantified. Seasonal trends revealed higher antibiotic loads during the wet season, predominantly from human sources, livestock, and aquaculture, with point sources as the largest sources. The primary contributors were livestock farming, particularly sheep, cattle, and broiler farming. Antibiotic residues were detected at higher concentrations in the river than in the reservoir, highlighting the river's critical role in transporting antibiotics from subbasins to the reservoir. Relevant fate processes for some antibiotic classes included, degradation in soil, and for others minimal sedimentation before they entered the reservoir and continued degradation afterwards. Antibiotic degradation varied by antibiotic class and hydrological conditions. Model validation showed that 80 % of antibiotic residues concentration in the reservoir fell within the observed range. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the model was sensitive to human and livestock populations, antibiotic consumption rates, manure management practices, and hydrological characteristics. This study provides the first assessment of antibiotic sources and dynamics in an Indonesian river-reservoir system, offering key insights to support strategies for reducing the impact of antibiotic residues on water-related ecosystems.					van Oel, Pieter/AAC-6636-2019; Hofstra, Nynke/C-7879-2014														0269-7491	1873-6424				SEP 15	2025	381								126583	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126583								40456305					WOS:001510046800002
J	Edwards, KJ; Langdon, PG; Slugden, H				Edwards, Kevin J.; Langdon, Peter G.; Slugden, Heather			Separating climatic and possible human impacts in the early Holocene: biotic response around the time of the 8200 cal. yr BP event	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The early Holocene is characterised by rapid climate change events, which in the North Atlantic region are often associated with changes in thermohaline circulation. Superimposed on this in northwest Europe is localised evidence for human impact on the landscape, although separating climatic and anthropogenic mechanisms for environmental change is often difficult. Biotic and sedimentological evidence from a lacustrine sequence from the Inner Hebrides, Scotland, shows a considerable reduction in inferred local woodland centred upon 8250 cal. yr BP. These data correlate precisely with a distinctive rise in the charcoal:pollen ratio and hence suggest a possible Mesolithic human impact upon the vegetation around this time. A quantitative temperature reconstruction from chironomid analyses from the same sequence, supported by sedimentological data, indicates that the fall in arboreal pollen taxa occurred as climate warmed significantly during the early Holocene. This warming was followed by a significant cold event, with mean July temperatures reduced by 2 degrees C, that lasted for at least 320 years ca. 7790-7470 cal. yr BP. Woodland recovered during this phase suggesting that the vegetation during the 8250 cal.yrBP interval was likely to have been responding to human activity, and not climate, and hence it is possible at specific sites to separate the influence of these key drivers of environmental change.

Composition, P-T parameters, and metasomatic transformations of mafic schists of the Svyatoi Nos Peninsula, Eastern Baikal Area	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												The paper reports data on rock and mineral compositions from the Svyatonosskaya Formation, which is a continuation of the Ol'khon Series in the northern part of the Svyatoi Nos Peninsula, eastern shore of Lake Baikal. The pyroxene-amphibole-plagioclase schists (metagabbro) are replaced there by the garnet-biotite-quartz assemblage, which was formed, according to the data of various geothermometers and calculations by the THERMOCALC computer program, under conditions corresponding to the transition from the granulite (848-811 degrees C) to high grades of the amphibolite (715-670 degrees C) facies under high pressures (8.7 +/- 1.6 kbar). In petrogenetic grids, these conditions fall onto the line of the onset of eclogitization. In nature these rocks are a continuation of the Chernorudskaya-Barakchinskaya zone of elevated pressures in the Ol'khon area. The metasomatic rocks were formed simultaneously with strike-slip faulting, when coupled zones of relatively high-(eclogite-like) and low-pressure (quartzite-marble melange) developed at the inflow of SiO2 and K2O and the removal of MgO and CaO. Analogous compositional changes in gneisses and schists in tectonic extension zones in Ol'khon Island and neighboring areas occurred during the development of migmatites. The migmatization of the gneisses was likely coupled with the garnetization of mafic schists in high-pressure zones and the formation of eclogite-like rocks replacing marbles. The accompanying graphitization of this block suggests that the metasomatic fluid had a hydrocarbon-hydrogen composition.																			0016-7029	1556-1968				FEB	2008	46	2					140	155		10.1134/S0016702908020043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0016702908020043													WOS:000254436000004

We hypothesized that the hydrogen isotopic composition of monarch butterfly wing keratin would reflect the hydrogen isotope patterns of rainfall in areas of natal origin where wings were formed. Monarchs were reared in the laboratory on milkweed plants (Asclepias sp.) grown with water of known deuterium content, and, with the assistance of volunteers, on native milkweeds throughout eastern North America. The results show that the stable hydrogen isotopic composition of monarch butterflies is highly correlated with the isotopic composition of the milkweed host plants, which in turn corresponds closely with the long-term geographic patterns of deuterium in rainfall. Stable-carbon isotope values in milkweed host plants were similarly correlated with those values in monarch butterflies and showed a general pattern of enrichment along a southwest to northeast gradient bisecting the Great Lakes. These findings indicate that natal origins of migratory and wintering monarchs in Mexico can be inferred from the combined delta D and delta(13)C isotopic signatures in their wings. This relationship establishes that analysis of hydrogen and carbon isotopes can be used to answer questions concerning the biology of migratory monarch butterflies and provides a new approach to tracking similar migratory movements of other organisms.

The evidence for this includes carbon spherules, aluminosilicate melt rocks, melted coatings of glass-like amorphous carbon, and Fe-Mn on sands and clasts derived from local felsic gneiss and granite. These sediments have been subjected to renewed investigation using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry, and new data show that spherules at site MUM7B exhibit unique morphologies and compositions. Molar oxide weight percentages prove the spherules are not volcanic and show little overlap with cosmic materials. Spherule microstructures display quench melting and, thus, could not have formed from slow geological authigenic, diagenetic, or metamorphic processes. Instead, geochemical values for the Venezuelan samples plot within the limits of impact-related materials, including tektites, ejecta, and impact spherules from a number of craters and strewnfields (cf. Chicxulub Crater, Chesapeake Bay Crater, Tunguska, Australasian tektite field, Lake Bosumtwi Crater, Ries Crater, and others). These results are identical to previously reported spherules from the Younger Dryas boundary layer (YDB) on three continents, North America, Europe, and Asia, and the most likely origin is from a cosmic impact/airburst 12.8 ka, as previously proposed. The MUM7B site is one of the two southernmost sites (Venezuela and Peru) in South America, thus extending the evidence supporting the YDB impact event into a new hemisphere on a new continent.					; Kalm, Volli/B-7440-2011	Mahaney, William/0000-0002-5803-7397; West, Allen/0000-0003-3576-4847													0022-1376	1537-5269				JUL	2013	121	4					309	325		10.1086/670652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670652													WOS:000320711100001

Bacterioplankton production was investigated seasonally at two locations from May to November 1985-1987. Eleven inflows and the outflowing River Narva were studied three times in the vegetation period 1985-1987 and in winter 1987. The average TC was highest in L. Pihkva (4.3 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)), lower in L. Lammijarv (3.9 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) and the lowest in the northern part of L. Peipsi (2.2 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)). According to these data, L. Pihkva and L. Lammijarv were similar to typical Estonian eutrophic lakes. L. Peipsi had mesotrophic features with a tendency to eutrophy in its southern part. The numbers of saprophytic bacteria (PC) in L. Pihkva and L. Lammijarv fluctuated from 110 to 360 cells ml(-1), in L. Peipsi from 98 to 290 cells ml(-1), and up to 5400 and 5900 cells ml(-1) in the mouths of the Rivers Velikaja and Suur Emajogi, respectively. The average production value per vegetation period was 37.9 g C m(-2). The numbers of Coliforms and Enterococci indicated that the pelagial was in a good sanitary state. Enterococci and high total Coliform numbers (up to 1000 per 100 mi) were determined at the mouths of the Rivers Suur Emajogi and Velikaja. In comparison with the early 1960s, 1.5-2.0-fold increase in the total amount of bacteria in the 1980s was revealed in the southern more eutrophic regions of L.

This study applies deep learning techniques to explore nonlinear long-term relationships between atmospheric variables simulated by the NorESM1-F model and river flow within two selected catchments, the Wujiang basin in Southern China and the Bulken basin in Western Norway. We investigate the feasibility of using atmospheric variables for long-term daily discharge simulations, especially in the context of cold-warm and dry- wet fluctuations over the past 1000 years. Our analysis delves into the changing patterns of atmospheric variables and their impact on discharge and flood patterns. The results indicate that (1) The deep state-space model could effectively simulate daily discharge at the catchment scale by incorporating relevant atmospheric variables of reanalysis data; (2) In our paleoclimate simulations, there is a noteworthy correlation between temperature and precipitation data from the NorESM1-F model over the past millennium with the reconstructed temperature and a proxy indicator for dry-wet conditions in the study basins; (3) Our investigation highlights differences in the simulation of solar1 and solar2, particularly in relation to climate variability associated with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). We observe that, during the periods characterized by larger oscillations in precipitation and temperature, the frequency of floods tends to increase.

J	Haileselasie, TH				Haileselasie, Tsegazeabe Hadush			Aquatic Bird Species Richness and Distribution along an Age Gradient of Reservoirs in Tigray National Regional State, Northern Ethiopia	WATERBIRDS												Natural wetlands, which are home to many waterbirds, face an unprecedented rate of loss and degradation in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, the number of artificial wetlands associated with reservoirs that are constructed for irrigation and household water consumption purposes has increased in the past four decades. It can be argued that these reservoirs can play an important role for waterbird conservation. However, there is little information on the avian fauna of these limnetic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to assess the richness and distribution of aquatic bird species in reservoirs in Tigray National Regional State, Northern Ethiopia. Eighty-five bird species from 54 genera, 25 families, and 15 bird orders were recorded, with a mean species richness 14.23 +/- 6.72 (mean +/- standard deviation) per reservoir. Five of these species are near threatened, while two other species fall under critically endangered and vulnerable conservation status designations, respectively. Bird species richness was positively correlated with the surface area of reservoirs. The result provides an important insight into the ecological relationship between waterbird species richness and the limnological characteristics of reservoirs, and plays a role towards strengthening our knowledge of aquatic bird ecology and the natural history of African-Eurasian Migratory waterbirds.

Stratification of the microbial community inhabiting an anchialine sinkhole	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bundera Sinkhole in northwestern Australia is an anchialine ecosystem characterised by a highly stratified water column comprising a complex polymodal profile of several physico-chemical parameters. We studied the microscale and finescale dynamics of the resident microbial community within the sinkhole. Sub-millimetre scale distributions of phytoplankton abundance were measured in the top 8 m of the water column using a free-falling high resolution fluorometer. Depth profiles were characterised by a strong, 10 to 20 cm layer of elevated fluorescence, occurring at approximately 1 m depth, which despite changes in magnitude and width was found to persist during a 24 h sampling period. Near surface distributions of microbial populations were measured using a syringe sampling profiler, which allowed for collection of water samples at 5 cm resolution, and flow cytometric analysis. These samples revealed a complex microbial assemblage, with multiple sub-populations of viruses, bacteria and picophytoplankton present throughout the water column. Within 3 m profiles, the bacterial and virus populations showed marked shifts in relative abundance, with changes of over 35-fold observed across as little as 20 cm. Samples collected from the surface to a depth of 30 m by divers also revealed distinct peaks and layers in the relative abundance of the different bacteria and virus sub-populations, which often corresponded to heterogeneities in chemical and nutrient parameters, and at some depths indicated the prevalence of chemolithotrophic populations. The complex patterns described here represent the first comprehensive observations of microbial spatiotemporal dynamics throughout an anchialine ecosystem and reveal a highly structured microbial habitat consisting of discrete niches, each dominated by heterotrophic, phototrophic or chemoautotrophic microorganisms.

Despite its importance, high-resolution quantifying the spatial variability of LGD remains challenging. Particularly, little studies have explored the impact of the interaction zone structure between lakes and aquifers on this variability. Present study presents a high-resolution quantitative estimation of LGD spatial patterns in an oxbow lake by combining thermal remote sensing with a 222Rn mass balance model. The vertical distribution characteristics of various parameters including lake water temperature, 222Rn concentration, electrical conductivity, and delta 18O were examined to elucidate the influence of groundwater on the distribution pattern of lake surface temperature (LST). Regression equations were formulated to correlate LST with lake water 222Rn concentration across different water depth zones, enabling the inverse calculation of the 222Rn concentration in the water of the entire lake. Utilizing a 222Rn mass balance model across all grid points, the LGD rate was determined to vary from 0 to 330.96 mm/d, with an average of 55.02 +/- 19.61 mm/d. In shallow water zones, the accumulation of lacustrine sediments has resulted in isolation from confined aquifers, causing LGD to primarily occur as springs in nearshore lake areas. Conversely, the direct connection between the deepwater zone of the lake and the water-rich confined aquifer has resulted in a higher LGD rate in the lake interior. Present study not only offers a novel approach for quantifying the spatial patterns of LGD but also provides valuable insights for LGD studies conducted in lakes globally.					gan, yiqun/NPI-6826-2025; Xu, Jiawen/NIS-6382-2025; 邓, 娅敏/B-1275-2019; Du, Yao/HDN-4489-2022														0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2025	61	1							e2024WR039334	10.1029/2024WR039334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR039334													WOS:001402974600001
J	Qi, XJ; Wang, JJ; Yao, F				Qi, Xuejun; Wang, Jingjing; Yao, Fang			Impacts of Small Lakes and Underlying Surface Characteristics on Local Thermal Environments in Summer	WATER												In recent years, rapid urbanization in China has significantly altered land use patterns and surface properties, exacerbating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This study investigates the microclimatic regulation potential of small lakes and their interaction with three distinct underlying surfaces (granite roads, lawns, and woodlands). Hourly measurements of air temperature and relative humidity were conducted from 15 July to 15 August 2024, at Tianlai Lake. The results demonstrate that granite roads exhibited the highest daytime air temperatures due to their low albedo and specific heat capacity. In contrast, lawns and woodlands can reduce surrounding temperatures via latent heat dissipation. The lake's cooling influence extended approximately 30 m from its boundary, with the air temperature decreasing by up to 2 degrees C near the shoreline. Relative humidity showed a negative correlation with distance from the lake, declining rapidly within 30 m. These findings highlight the role of small lakes in mitigating UHI effects and provide actionable insights for optimizing lakeside underlying surface planning in urban areas.																				2073-4441				APR 29	2025	17	9							1327	10.3390/w17091327	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17091327													WOS:001486160000001
J	JANSSON, M; ANDERSSON, R; BERGGREN, H; LEONARDSON, L				JANSSON, M; ANDERSSON, R; BERGGREN, H; LEONARDSON, L			WETLANDS AND LAKES AS NITROGEN TRAPS	AMBIO												Eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen loading has been a steadily increasing problem in southern Swedish coastal waters during the last fifteen years. Political decisions now aim at decreasing the anthropogenic nitrogen emissions by 50% before 1996. Nitrogen export from farmland is a major problem in this context. Therefore, the nitrogen retention capacity in different types of wetlands in agricultural areas in southern Sweden was studied in order to determine whether wetlands could be used to reduce nitrogen export from farmland to the coastal marine ecosystems. Nitrogen retention mechanisms were also investigated in lakes with increased nitrogen loading. The results demonstrate that nitrogen removal in wetlands depends mainly on denitrification. in addition to denitrification, sedimentation can be quantitatively important in lakes. The water retention time is the most critical singel factor for removal of nitrogen. Thus, lakes remove more nitrogen than small wetlands even though the specific nitrogen retention (N retention m(2)) is generally considerably higher in wetlands. Ponds are recommended as the most suitable type of wetland for nitrogen removal. A major problem for using wetlands as a mean for reducing the nitrogen transport in southern Sweden is that most of the transport occurs during high flow periods in winter when the retention time in the wetlands is too short to permit efficient removal by biological processes like denitrification. Large-scale establishment of a great number of wetlands within a catchment may reduce the nitrogen transport by up to about 15%. In most cases, the result will probably be less.																			0044-7447					SEP	1994	23	6					320	325																WOS:A1994PN58600002

Diatom responses to microenvironment structure within metaphyton mats	INLAND WATERS												Microscale conditions within metaphyton mats affected the distribution of diatom genera. We investigated the conditions within layers of floating filamentous algal mats and changes in diatom genera over 57 days using microprobes every 2, 4, and 6 cm down through mats held in floating nets. Mats were then collected, frozen, and sliced into 2 cm layers for analysis. Filamentous algae and their diatom epiphytes were identified, counted, and analyzed for nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, silicon, ash-free dry mass (AFDM), and chlorophyll a. Light intensity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, dry mass, and AFDM all fell significantly with increasing depth in the mat. Diatom coverage per filament was calculated as an epiphyte area index (EAI) and was significantly higher at the edge versus the center of the mat. The uppermost 2 cm layer showed the greatest downward trend in EAI over the sampling period. The densities of Gomphonema, Cocconeis, and Fragilaria were significantly positively correlated with lower light intensity and lower layers of the mat. Cymbella/Encyonema density was significantly correlated with higher light intensity. Gomphonema, Cocconeis, and Nitzschia were positively correlated with filaments with higher chlorophyll a content. Achnanthidium, Cymbella/Encyonema, and Nitzschia required higher levels of silicon. Diatoms with different growth habits responded similarly to measured variables. Stalk-forming Gomphonema and adnate Cocconeis both occurred in lower light areas and grew well under low nitrogen and phosphorus conditions.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	2					224	233		10.5268/IW-6.2.802	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.2.802													WOS:000376486500012

Paleo-indicators and water quality change in the Charlotte Harbor estuary (Florida)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We reconstructed water quality changes for 1800 to 2000 in Charlotte Harbor (Florida), a shallow subtropical estuary, by using a suite of biological and geochemical proxies in dated sediments collected in the region of a present day, midsummer hypoxic zone. The declining freshwater loading into the estuary from 1931 to the 1980s is not the probable causal agent encouraging the appearance or expansion of a hypoxia zone (measuring up to 90 km(2) in summer). Rather, the reconstructed trends in nitrogen loading indicate increased phytoplankton production has likely caused a decline in bottom water oxygen concentrations. Sedimentary biogenic silica (BSi), carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations increased concurrently with known or inferred changes in nutrient loadings. There were direct relationships between phytoplankton pigments and BSi, heavier delta S-14 with increased carbon loading, and sequestration of P, Al, and Fe as carbon loading increased. The results from the sediment analyses and the results from mixing models using C : N ratios and delta C-13 suggest an estuarine system that is responsive to increased carbon loading from the nitrogen-limited phytoplankton community and whose sediments are becoming increasingly anoxic as a result. The present nitrogen loading is about three times above that prior to the 1800s, suggesting that without management intervention the anticipated doubling of the watershed's population from 1990 to 2020 will greatly increase the nitrogen loading to this estuary and will lead to much higher amounts of phytoplankton biomass and accumulation and exacerbate hypoxic conditions.					; Turner, Robert/GQA-6087-2022	Oswald, Tabea/0000-0001-9150-3487; Rabalais, Nancy N./0000-0002-1514-837X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2006	51	1	2				518	533		10.4319/lo.2006.51.1_part_2.0518	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.1_part_2.0518													WOS:000241296700014

This study evaluates the effects of surrounding groundwater flow on seepage direction and assesses factors that affect seepage flux in a closed-basin lake in northeastern Estonia - Lake Martiska. A piezometric map was used to determine directions of groundwater flow around the lake. Seepage meters were applied for measuring flux at 44 locations along eight transects in the lake in relation to water depth, distance from the shore, sediment type and thickness of organic sediment. Additionally nearshore ice-free areas were mapped in winter. Seepage patterns followed the estimated directions of groundwater flow in nearshore areas. Outseepage records showed the impacts of nearby groundwater-abstraction wells on groundwater flow. However, the within-lake seepage direction and flux differed from the expected at 6-15 m from the shore and water depth of 1-2 m. Seepage flux and physical factors of the lake were uncorrelated. Even with a 3.2 m thick layer of gyttja, seepage influx was 13 ml m(-2) min(-1); therefore thick lacustrine sediments do not necessarily prevent inseepage. The results suggest that a local confined aquifer around and underneath the lake may cause the observed inseepage pattern.

In this study, we present a high resolution palaeoecological dataset covering the past 7300 years. For this purpose, a peat section has been sampled from the shore of Dabusu lake situated in the southwestern part of the Songnen grasslands. We use pollen analyses to reconstruct the regional and local vegetation dynamics, and measure TOC (total organic carbon) and the degree of peat humification to study changes in regional and local biomass. Diatom analysis, grain size analysis, and CaCO3 contents are used to assess the water-table fluctuations of the Dabusu peatlands. The results show that from 7300 to 6000 cal BP, Dabusu peatlands were characterized by grasslands, dominated by Poaceae plants and high-water level. From 6000 to 910 cal BP, forest-steppes and dry-steppes dominated in the region alternatively. The water level of Dabusu peatlands experienced relatively low levels following an earlier rapid decline around 6000-5100 cal BP. Then after a slight increase between 5100 and 4000 cal BP, it remained at a relatively low level until 910 cal BP. After 910 cal BP, steppe vegetation dominated in the region and the water level of Dabusu peatlands slightly rose. By comparing these features with regional climate change, we show that EASM circulations might be the main driving forces controlling the regional paleovegetation dynamics and hydrological variations. This outcome is critical for the understanding of the long-term interactions between vegetation, hydrology, and climate of mid-latitude semi-arid grasslands.					; Alenius, Teija/AAS-1906-2021; Niu, Honghao/JDN-0507-2023; li, mengzhen/HHS-7801-2022; Chambers, Frank/I-2965-2012; Wang, Yanqi/KPB-3609-2024	Niu, Honghao/0000-0001-9336-7079; Chambers, Frank/0000-0002-0998-2093; MARQUER, LAURENT/0000-0002-5772-3782; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAY 1	2022	593								110917	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110917		MAR 2022											WOS:000807369200002

For one model-the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory or GFDL model-the daily model results were used to drive a distributed hydrologic model. The watershed model used an energy balance approach for computing evapotranspiration and snowpack dynamics so that the processes remain a function of the climate change projections. For this study, all other aspects of the model (i.e. land use distribution, routing configuration, and parameterization) were held constant to isolate impacts of climate change projections. The results indicate that (1) precipitation falling as rain rather than snow will increase, starting at the current mean snowline, and moving towards higher elevations over time; (2) annual accumulated snowpack will be reduced; (3) snowpack accumulation will start later; and (4) snowmelt will start earlier in the year. Certain changes were masked (or counter-balanced) when summarized as basin-wide averages; however, spatial evaluation added notable resolution. While rainfall runoff increased at higher elevations, a drop in total precipitation volume decreased runoff and fine sediment load from the lower elevation meadow areas and also decreased baseflow and nitrogen loads basin-wide. This finding also highlights the important role that the meadow areas could play as high-flow buffers under climatic change. Because the watershed model accounts for elevation change and variable meteorological patterns, it provided a robust platform for evaluating the impacts of projected climate change on hydrology and water quality.					; Dettinger, Michael/JAC-9558-2023	Dettinger, Michael/0000-0002-7509-7332; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				JAN	2013	116	1			SI		35	50		10.1007/s10584-012-0629-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0629-8													WOS:000312632700003

Multiplatform observations of dust vertical distribution during transport over northwest Iran in the summertime	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Dynamical processes leading to dust emission over Iran and surrounding countries in the summer as well as the subsequent transport of dust toward northwest Iran are analyzed on the basis of two case studies using a suite of ground-based and spaceborne remote sensing platforms together with modeling tools. Ground-based lidar measurements acquired in Zanjan provide new insight into the vertical distribution of dust linked to transport over northwest Iran and highlight the importance of low-level transport of dust from both Iraq and Iran for air quality issues in Tehran. During the 3-5 August 2007 case, dust emission regions are located in Syria/Iraq and close to Qom, Iran, in a large intermittent salt lake in the western part of the Dasht-e Kavir desert. The visibility in Tehran associated with this event decreases significantly (reaching 7 km) on 5 August 2007 only. During the 11-13 September 2008 case, the dust transported to northwest Iran originates from Syria/Iraq only. The visibility in Tehran during this case is low throughout the period, sometimes less than 5 km due to the transport of dust at low levels. In both cases, emissions in Syria and Iraq occur in response to strong Shamal winds. However, transport of dust toward Iran takes place at different levels: above 700 hPa in August and below 700 hPa in September. This is found to be related to the presence of strong northeasterly winds over the Zagros Mountains as well as in its lee (south of the range) in the August case only. In August also, dust emissions in the Qom region results from strong winds blowing over the Dasht-e Kavir desert.

Deep lake channel-levee-lobe and slope fan deposits are identified within six depositional sequences that span from the Turonian to early Coniacian upper part of the fourth member of the Quantou Formation and Qingshankou Formation to the early Campanian second member of the Nenjiang Formation. Research on the sediment gravity-flow systems in the Songliao Basin has broad application for understanding the sedimentary processes and pattern of sediment gravity-flow systems, and predicting the presence of good sandstone reservoirs within postrift downwarped lacustrine basins. Research results show that the channel-levee-lobe deposits are present within sequences in the first member of the Qinshankou Formation and the first member of the Nenjiang Formation. The straight channel levees and slope fans were on high-gradient slopes, whereas the sinuous channel levees were on low-gradient slopes. The straight-to-sinuous channel levees, fed by northeastern deltaic subaqueous distributary channels, extend for 15-70 km, predominantly within transgressive-to early highstand system tracts, which terminated in bifurcated or small lobes. The channel-levee-lobe and slope fan deposits sourced from western deltas were deposited basinward of the syndepositional flexural slope-break zones controlled by deep-seated faults. The falling trajectories of the paleoshorelines during the highstand and lowstand systems tracts and large sediment fluxes during the transgressive systems tracts resulted in the development of the slope fans and channel-levee-lobes. Lakebed paleorelief influenced the channel forms. Sand bodies within the channel-levee-lobes and slope fans, encased within organic-rich source rocks, represent new significant targets for hydrocarbon exploration.

The interaction of the thermal water with both silicic (basaltic) and sedimentary rocks and its low enthalpy (T <= 150 degrees C) regime make this area an optimal site for testing chemical and isotope geothermometers and optimizing them for similar difficult cases. In this study, the use of radiogenic carbon (C-14) reveals that the age of the deep aquifer is between 12,500 and 8700 years ago (late Pleistocene/early-to-mid Holocene), which places it within the East African Humid Period. The oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios of the water molecules, delta H-2(H2O), delta O-18(H2O), show common characteristics between the groundwater from this area and that of groundwater from nearby local lakes (Asal-Abhe) and palaeolakes (Sakalol-Hanle-Gaggade-Dobi), which were interconnected during that period to form the terminal Awash River Basin. The comparison of these aquifers within the transboundary aquifer located between northeast Ethiopia and Djibouti helps to reconstruct both the palaeoenvironmental history and the hydro-geochemical characteristics of this regional aquifer. At present, these data are poorly defined, but it is of fun-damental importance for the constructive use of water resources in arid areas. Finally, a conceptual model was proposed for the Hanle-Gaggade low-enthalpy geothermal system on the basis of the geochemical and isotope data on the thermal and non-thermal groundwaters combined with geological and tectonic information and the results of recent geophysical studies.					; Boschetti, Tiziano/F-8446-2011; Ahmed, Moussa/AAF-8144-2019	Awaleh, Mohamed Osman/0000-0003-1268-0982; ASSOWE DABAR, Omar/0000-0002-4095-3194; 													0375-6505	1879-3576				JUL	2020	86								101805	10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101805	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101805													WOS:000534152600017

The structures include recurved groove casts (the first reported occurrence), other curvilinear grooves, and opposed prod casts. Gutter casts and sinusoid-like chevron marks are associated with these sole marks, but flute casts and other undisputed indicators of unidirectional flow were not noted. Sole structures and gutter casts are oriented normal to the strike of wave-ripple crests and to the elongation direction of hummocky-cross-stratified lenses. Inclined strata within the lenses locally show a preferred migration direction parallel to the elongation direction. The erosional structures are inferred to have been generated during storms in a shallow lake by oscillatory and/or combined flow, the latter possibly associated with longshore currents. These storms also produced hummocky cross-stratification. Wave-formed sole structures may be common in the rock record, and can be recognized by curvilinear shapes, including rare recurved shapes, and bimodal orientations. Care should be taken when interpreting sole structures from wave-influenced settings, because they may not indicate directions of net sediment transport or the orientation of unidirectional currents.																			1073-130X					JUL 1	1994	64	3					508	517																WOS:A1994PA95600006

This study examines the related influence factors and physical mechanisms driving North China's anomalous precipitation in June-July 2022. Results show that the simultaneous diabatic heating over northwestern India associated with the local record-breaking precipitation induces an upper-level anticyclonic anomaly over Northeast Asia via exciting the circumglobal teleconnection pattern, which favours intensified upward motion and more precipitation over North China. In addition, the extreme Arctic warming, especially in the Barents-Kara Sea, in June-July 2022 excites a southeastward-propagated Rossby wave train, leading to low-level cyclonic and upper-level anticyclonic anomalies over the Lake Baikal-Ural Mountains regions and Northeast Asia respectively. The anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomalies drive the local divergence anomalies (southerly wind) in the upper (lower) troposphere of North China, favouring more precipitation over there. The numerical simulation based on a linear baroclinic model could reproduce the above-mentioned physical processes.																			0899-8418	1097-0088				2025 JUL 9	2025										10.1002/joc.70029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.70029		JUL 2025											WOS:001524647100001

Here, the process-based National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model was developed further for controlled discharge release at reservoirs to predict the impact of the Three-Gorges Dam (TGD) and South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) on eco-hydrological changes. The model predicted that TGD might promote flood risk during the early summer monsoon (contrary to original justifications), and that morphological change over the long-term would promote the flood risk. This indicates the importance of managing both flood discharge and sediment deposition for the entire basin. Furthermore, time-integrated NDVI (TINDVI) estimated from satellite images during the past two decades showed generally decreasing trends beside the lakes, which indicates that the increase in lake reclamation and the resultant decrease in rice production were closely related to the hydrologic changes.

Hence, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on coastal catchments is a challenging task. In the present study, a coupled groundwater-surface water model is forced by dynamically downscaled results from a general circulation model. The effects on water quantity and quality of a relatively large lake used for water supply are analyzed. Although stream inflow to the lake is predicted to decrease during summer, the storage capacity of the lake is found to provide a sufficient buffer to support sustainable water abstraction in the future. On the other hand, seawater intrusion into the stream is found to be a significant threat to the water quality of the lake, possibly limiting its use for water supply and impacting the aquatic environment. Additionally, the results indicate that the nutrient load to the lake and adjacent coastal waters is likely to increase significantly, which will increase eutrophication and have negative effects on the surface water ecology. The hydrological impact assessment is based on only one climate change projection; nevertheless, the range of changes generated by other climate models indicates that the predicted results are a plausible realization of climate change impacts. The problems identified here are expected to be relevant for many coastal regimes, where the hydrology is determined by the interaction between saline and fresh groundwater and surface water systems.					; Sonnenborg, Torben/P-1959-2017; Hinsby, Klaus/C-1806-2008; Stisen, Simon/Q-2832-2017; Sonnenborg, Torben O/P-1959-2017; van Roosmalen, Lieke/D-2096-2011	Hinsby, Klaus/0000-0003-1190-4550; Stisen, Simon/0000-0001-6695-8412; Sonnenborg, Torben O/0000-0001-9042-8702; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				AUG	2012	113	3-4					1025	1048		10.1007/s10584-011-0367-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0367-3													WOS:000306337100026

This paper investigates whether or not the well-documented demise of Sinemurian carbonate platforms in the Tethyan region was a response to a global event by examination of carbon-isotope anomalies in successions of different facies that record this interval of time. A chemostratigraphic transect from Lake Garda up to the eastern Italian border is illustrated by four stratigraphic sections; high-resolution (20 cm over key intervals) chemostratigraphic sampling allowed detection of a major negative C-13 anomaly of similar to 1.5 parts per thousand, preceded by a positive excursion, both in shallow- and deep-water successions, over the stratigraphical range of the ammonite genus Arnioceras. A comparison with sections from the UK suggests that the positive excursion belongs to the turneri Zone and the succeeding negative excursion falls within the obtusum Zone. In the deep-water Belluno Basin, the negative anomaly occurs in a biogenic chert-rich unit recording the onset of mesotrophic conditions in the basin. In the platform-carbonate successions, this major negative carbon-isotope excursion is developed within a calcarenitic unit corresponding to the lowest occurrence of the foraminifer Paleomayncina termieri. This evidence for deepening and transgression across the carbonate platform suggests pre-conditioning for drowning. Hence, rather than tectonic subsidence alone, environmental factors may have aided the demise of Tethyan carbonate platforms during the Early Jurassic Sinemurian Age.

This work evaluated the variation of primary production and phytoplankton biomass in one station in Escobillitas swamp in the complex of Ayapel system, located in northern Colombia. Primary production presented variation in relation to the flood pulse, as it ranged from 0 (high water ascent in 2007) and 191.6 ingC m(-2) d(-1) (high water on the decline in 2007) with an average value of 108.6 mgC m(-2) d(-1). We found the highest gross primary production in high water falling, a condition accompanied by increased algal biomass photosynthetic efficiency, reduction low rates in respiration and the P / B and P / R. ratios. Between consecutive hydrological cycles variations in the patterns of primary production the high water rising in 2006 had a low biomass, high PPB, with the highest photosynthetic efficiency, and low respiration rates; in contrast, for the same period of the hydrological flood pulse in 2007, an increase in biomass and reducing of PPB, photosynthetic efficiency, P / B ratio and respiration were observed. The water system changed between euproductive and oligoproductive, which indicates a high trophic dynamics.

LakeNet: An integrated sensor network for environmental sensing in lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Field investigations in the hydrologic sciences often are limited by the ability to collect data at the high spatiotemporal resolution necessary to build accurate predictive models or to control complex engineered systems in real time. Here, we describe LakeNet, an embedded wireless sensor network constructed by an interdisciplinary team of hydrogeologists, environmental engineers, and electrical engineers at the University of Notre Dame. Off-the-shelf temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH probes are suspended from floating, waterproof cases with electronics, forming sensor pods. Wireless transmission to relay stations and a PC gateway enable researchers to interact with the network remotely to alter sampling patterns, download data, and analyze data trends using the gateway's recursive processing of raw data. LakeNet functions as a "smart" network, in which each pod is aware of surrounding pods. Ongoing research will allow in-network computation to detect change points in the data stream, thus triggering altered sampling strategy in response to sensed events or individual probe/pod failure. This ability for the sensor network to alter sampling strategy can increase sensor shelf life, which will become more important as novel sensors are developed, and decrease system energy requirements. Initial deployment at St. Mary's Lake on the Notre Dame campus in the fall of 2005 showed that temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen changes were consistent with diurnal fluctuations in sunlight, hence, photosynthesis. In describing LakeNet, we summarize current capabilities and ongoing research, including some of the challenges that need to be overcome for further sensor network development, widespread deployment, and maximum usefulness.

As well, there is little information on the ability of fish to biotransform PCBs. To address these issues, juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to dietary concentrations of three Aroclor(R) mixtures (1248, 1254, 1260) in food for 30 d followed by an additional 160 d of nonspiked food at 8degreesC. Accumulation, depuration, and potential biotransformation of 92 PCB congeners were assessed. Half-lives (t(1/2)) of PCB congeners ranged from 79 to 182 d, assimilation efficiencies ranged from 40 to 50% and biomagnification factors (BMF) ranged from 2.9 to 6.9. No evidence of significant biotransformation of any PCB congeners was found. All 92 congeners fell on the same t(1/2) to K-ow relationship as 16 preselected PCB congeners previously shown to persist in fish and no hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs) were detected in the plasma after 30 d of exposure. These findings suggest that OH-PCBs observed in feral fish may be accumulated from sources other than internal metabolism of the parent congeners, at least for juvenile fish at cool temperatures. Because t(1/2)s in this experiment were slower than t(1/2)s reported in other work, water temperature also may be an important factor in determining the t(1/2)s of all PCB congeners in fish.					; Solomon, Keith/AAF-4510-2020	Solomon, Keith R/0000-0002-8496-6413; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				JUL	2004	23	7					1725	1736		10.1897/03-336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/03-336								15230325					WOS:000221995300018

It describes the functional structure of the GIS of flood monitoring. The study justifies the advantage of the basin approach in flood assessment and mapping. We determine the basic regional climatic and physico-geographical factors of flood formation and characterize the main indicators of the territory danger from floods: frequency, magnitude and extent of floods. As hydrological information, we used the calculated water levels in the sections obtained from annual probability distribution curves of exceeding the maximum water levels from rainfall floods. The flood indicator is calculated as the difference of the maximum rise in the water level above the critical level of water outflow to the floodplain. Calculation data show that the maximum values of water levels in the basin's rivers are the most characteristic of the summer flood period. We have determined physico-geographical features of flood distribution on the main rivers of the study area, performed geoinformation mapping of flood parameters within the main river basins and described the technique of interactive work with GIS through geoinformation queries as well as characterized the response models of the hazard development.

J	Wagner, B; Bennike, O				Wagner, Bernd; Bennike, Ole			Chronology of the last deglaciation and Holocene environmental changes in the Sisimiut area, SW Greenland based on lacustrine records	BOREAS												The Sisimiut area was deglaciated in the early Holocene, c. 11?cal.?ka BP. At that time the lowlands were inundated by the sea, but the isostatic rebound surpassed the global sea-level rise, and the lowlands emerged from the sea. The pioneer vegetation in the area consisted of mosses and herbaceous plants. The oldest remains of woody plants (Empetrum nigrum) are dated to c. 10.3?cal.?ka BP, and remains of Salix herbacea and Harrimanella hypnoides are found in slightly younger sediments. The maximum occurrence of statoblasts of the bryozoan Plumatella repens from c.?10 to 4.5?cal.?ka BP probably reflects the Holocene thermal maximum, which is also indicated in geochemical proxies of the lake sediments. A maximum in organic matter accumulation in one of the three studied lakes c. 3?cal.?ka BP can probably be ascribed to a late Holocene short-duration temperature maximum or a period of increased aridity. Cenococcum geophilum sclerotia are common in the late Holocene, implying increased soil erosion during the Neoglaciation. A comparison with sediment and macrofossil records from inland shows similar Holocene trends and a similar immigration history. It also reveals that there has been a significant gradient throughout the Holocene, from an oceanic and stable climate at the outer coast to a more continental and unstable climate with warmer summers and drier conditions close to the margin of the Greenland ice sheet, where the buffer capacity of the sea is lower.

R.; Soto, Alejandro; Moisan, Enora; Lora, Juan M.; Le Gall, Alice; Hueso, Ricardo; Spiga, Aymeric			The impact of lake shape and size on lake breezes and air-lake exchanges on Titan	ICARUS												Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has many lakes on its surface, formed mainly of liquid methane. Like water lakes on Earth, these methane lakes on Titan likely profoundly affect the local climate. Previous studies (Rafkin and Soto, 2020; Chatain et al., 2022) showed that Titan's lakes create lake breeze circulations with characteristic dimensions similar to the ones observed on Earth. However, such studies used a model in two dimensions; this work investigates the consequences of the addition of a third dimension to the model. Our results show that 2D simulations tend to overestimate the extension of the lake breeze over the land, and underestimate the strength of the subsidence over the lake, due to divergence/convergence geometrical effects in the mass conservation equations. In addition, 3D simulations including a large scale background wind show the formation of a pocket of accelerated wind behind the lake, which did not form in 2D simulations. An investigation of the effect of shoreline concavity on the resulting air circulation shows the formation of wind currents over peninsulas. Simulations with several lakes can either result in the formation of several individual lake breeze cells (during the day), or the emergence of a large merged cell with internal wind currents between lakes (during the night). Simulations of several real-shaped lakes located at a latitude of 74 degrees N on Titan at the autumn equinox show that larger lakes trigger stronger winds, and that some sections of lakes might accumulate enough methane vapor to form a thin fog. Additionally, we adapted the Turbulent Kinetic Energy closure scheme of the model to better represent the extremely low turbulence at the surface of Titan, of 2 10(-4) m(2).s(-2) above the land, and inferior to 3 10(-5) m(2).s(-2) above the lake. The addition of a third dimension, along with adjustments in the parametrizations of turbulence and subsurface land temperature, results in a reduction in the magnitude of the average lake evaporate rate, namely to similar to 6 cm/Earth year.

J	Wilkins, DE				Wilkins, DE			Hemiarid basin responses to abrupt climatic change: Paleolakes of the Trans-Pecos Closed Basin	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Western North American hemiarid basins situated along a climate boundary zone, or threshold, that separates regions of different climate regimes exhibit greater variability to changes in hydroclimatic variables. The Trans-Pecos Closed Basin study examines how global paleoclimatic factors and intrinsic geographic controls act in determining the threshold between stares of hydroclimatic equilibria. Geomorphic, radiocarbon, and limnetic evidence identifies four major highstands for late Pleistocene Lake King during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Patterns in the resulting model limnograph for Lake King suggest that runoff contributions from basin catchments to the inundated area were limited by precipitation rather than evaporation. Timing of the onset of lacustrine transgressive events corresponds with the later stages of cooling events recorded in the Greenland ice and North Atlantic deep-sea sedimentary record. Correlation of Trans-Pecos lacustrine environments with North Atlantic cooling implies that full pluvial conditions in the basin were limited to those periods when those cooling events resulted in extreme equatorward shifts of the LGM subpolar winter storm tracks, providing a moisture source to the basin. By comparing timing, intensity, and direction of climate change over a widely spaced array of hemiarid basins, the global implications of climatic events are better understood.

From drones to bones: Assessing the importance of abiotic factors for salmonid spawning behaviour and embryonic development through a multidisciplinary approach	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The ecology of salmonids is tightly linked to their spawning habitats, but the link between spawning site selection and phenology is poorly understood. To address this, we studied the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) from the postglacial lake Thingvallavatn (Iceland) through a multidisciplinary approach involving aerial surveys, behavioural observations, temperature monitoring and embryo rearing experiments. Aerial footage revealed that most nests (i.e. redds) were established in shallow parts of the spawning area, and we reported through direct observations trends for stronger male-male competition and for more frequent courtship behaviours in shallow than in deep redds. While water depth did not correlate with temperature at the time of spawning, the temperatures recorded at the shallow redds were consistently lower in the two months following the video recordings, likely because of the proximity of glacial outlets. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the temperature regimes in shallow waters can delay hatching with about a month, likely impacting the phenology of the offspring.

J	Kleeberg, A				Kleeberg, A			Re-assessment of Wundsch's (1940) 'H2S-Oscillatoria-Lake' type using the eutrophic Lake Scharmutzel (Brandenburg, NE Germany) as an example	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Thienemann's 1922 'biological lake' classification indicates the increase in the trophic level of lakes. It is based on the sucession of the disappearance of certain benthic indicator organisms in relation to the gradient of a decreasing O(2)concentration in the deep water, i.e. from O-2-sensitive Chironomidae spp. (non-biting midges) to the less sensitive Chaoboridae ( phantom midges) larvae. As early as the mid 1930s, several lakes in Brandenburg, e. g. Lake Scharmutzel, belonged to the last category of this classification. They were O-2-deficient in deep water during summer and lacked the Chironomidae larvae. Simultaneously, filamentous cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) appeared. This lead to the replacement of Thienemann's indicators, i.e. O-2 by H2S and Chironomidae by Oscillatoriales, and to Wundsch's 1940 new 'H2S-Oscillatoria-Lake' type. Since H2S and Oscillatoriales were not clearly identified as symptoms of eutrophication, it is not justified to use them to characterise a separate lake type. However, these indicators are of ecological importance, since the regional and common creeping increase in SO42- concentration favoures the current high H2S formation. The successive deterioration in O-2 conditions, the increase in the extent of H2S formation related to the decrease in species diversity clearly indicates that Lake Scharmutzel reached a qualitatively new state of eutrophication within 60 years.																			0018-8158					JUL	2003	501	1-3					1	5		10.1023/A:1026276200878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026276200878													WOS:000186041800001
J	Keith, JO; O'Neill, EJ				Keith, JO; O'Neill, EJ			Movements of juvenile American White Pelicans from breeding colonies in California and Nevada	WATERBIRDS												Young American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorynchus) were marked with dyes (for two years) and patagial tags (for four years) just before they fledged from three breeding colonies in California and Nevada. This was done to identify movements and areas used by pelicans in an investigation of pesticide-related mortality of the birds in the west. Dyes on feathers disappeared after four months, while tags remained on birds for up to one year or more. Dispersal from the three colonies varied among colonies and years. Most dyed birds from Anaho Island moved into the central valley of California in 1963, but most remained in the Western Great Basin in the fall of 1964. In 1963 and 1964, some dyed juveniles from Lower Klamath Lake and Clear Lake dispersed into California, but others moved into the Snake River Plain and the Great Salt Lake. Most sightings of juveniles tagged between 1967 and 1970 were reported near breeding colonies and from the San Joaquin Valley, the Pacific Coast, Southern California, and Mexico. Results identified the relative use of specific wetlands by pelicans from colonies and suggested movements in some years were influenced by weather and habitat conditions.																			0738-6028						2000	23	1					33	37																WOS:000086697200004

Modeling the role of wind and warming on Microcystis aeruginosa blooms in shallow lakes with different trophic status	THEORETICAL ECOLOGY												This study focuses on the role of wind exposure and storm events, in interaction with trophic status and temperature, on the competition between two species: Microcystis aeruginosa and a typical green alga. It is based on a water column model containing ecological and fluid mechanic features including mixing and shear stress at the bottom. This model addresses for the first time the impact of storm events (inducing sediment and nutrient resuspension) on algal dynamics. Simulations with realistic environmental forcings were performed with different sets of wind, temperature, and trophic conditions. With normal temperatures, conditions for dominance and bloom formation of M. aeruginosa in summer are restricted to hypertrophic waters with low wind exposure. Higher wind exposure (above 2 m s(-1)) impairs the formation blooms even in favorable trophic conditions and enhances the dominance of green algae. Hotter temperatures allow the dominance of M. aeruginosa for lower phosphorus conditions and higher wind exposure and lead to the exclusion of green algae for high phosphorus content and low wind exposure. Nevertheless, high wind exposure (above 3 m s(-1)) still prevents dense bloom formation and allows the coexistence of both species. Storm events bring two counterbalancing features: sediment and nutrient resuspension. The first leads to a decrease of phytoplankton density in response to high turbidity, and the second leads to an increase and better maintenance of M. aeruginosa blooms due to high phosphorus concentration released in the water. This result depends on the timing of the event and on general wind exposure as phosphorus release only benefits M. aeruginosa if exposure to wind is low.					; Madricardo, Fantina/AAY-2986-2020	Madricardo, Fantina/0000-0002-9474-3491; Hulot, Florence D./0000-0002-8897-3987; 													1874-1738	1874-1746				FEB	2014	7	1					35	52		10.1007/s12080-013-0196-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-013-0196-2													WOS:000332025700005
J	Owen, RB; Potts, R; Behrensmeyer, AK; Ditchfield, P				Owen, R. Bernhart; Potts, Richard; Behrensmeyer, Anna K.; Ditchfield, Peter			Diatomaceous sediments and environmental change in the Pleistocene Olorgesailie Formation, southern Kenya Rift Valley	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Olorgesailie Formation is comprised of lacustrine, volcaniclastic and alluvial sediments that formed in the southern Kenya Rift between about 1.2 million and 490,000 years ago. Diatoms are common in much of the sequence and preserve a record of environmental change within the basin. A high-resolution diatom stratigraphy has been developed for these deposits. The data document the presence of freshwater and saline lakes as well as wetlands. Transfer functions indicate that these water bodies ranged in conductivity between about 200-20,000 mu S cm(-1), with pH varying between about 7.5 and 10.3. Pedogenesis affected multiple horizons within the succession, reflecting periods of emergence that encompass much of the time represented by the Olorgesailie Formation. A variety of other sedimentological indicators (carbonates, rhizoliths, mudcracks, erosional channels) also record periods when the sampled portions of the basin were dominated by terrestrial conditions. Stone tools are common at several levels, indicating the use of the area by hominins. Lakes and wetlands were potentially usable as sources of potable water by hominins for part of the basin history, but at other times were undrinkable. Other water sources (springs, rivers) would have been necessary during these periods. Paleoenvironments in the basin were complex and changed frequently with time. Such shifts in resources and habitat distribution during Olorgesailie Formation time seem likely to have influenced the behavior and evolution of local plant and animal populations, including Homo.

J	Fletcher, CJN; Siddle, HJ				Fletcher, CJN; Siddle, HJ			Development of glacial Llyn Teifi, west Wales: evidence for lake-level fluctuations at the margins of the Irish Sea ice sheet	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												A thick sequence of Quaternary laminated silt and clay, sand, gravel, and diamict has recently been proven at Llandudoch (St Dogmaels), west Wales. Most of these deposits accumulated in a tributary valley of Afon (River) Teifi, that formed prior to the last glaciation. The laminated silt and clay occur up to 103 m above present sea level, and are considered to have been deposited in Llyn (Lake) Teifi-a large ice-dammed lake that developed in the Teifi valley as the Irish Sea ice sheet impinged onto the Welsh mainland during the late Devensian. Rhythmic units are interpreted as annual varves, whose composition was determined by the distance from the sediment discharge point. Short-term climate fluctuations during the summer months are evident in some of the varve units. Stratigraphic variations within the laminated deposits are considered to reflect different levels of Llyn Teifi, which varied according to the position of the Irish Sea ice sheet in the Teifi valley and the elevations of three overspill channels. The overlying diamict, sand and gravel deposits are thought to have accumulated close to the ice front as it encroached into Llyn Teifi. During the final retreat of the Irish Sea ice sheet a series of kamiform sand and gravel deposits formed along the margins of the glacier.																			0016-7649	2041-479X				MAR	1998	155		2				389	399		10.1144/gsjgs.155.2.0389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.155.2.0389													WOS:000072499500013
J	Balagizi, CM; Kasereka, MM; Cuoco, E; Liotta, M				Balagizi, Charles M.; Kasereka, Marcellin M.; Cuoco, Emilio; Liotta, Marcello			Influence of moisture source dynamics and weather patterns on stable isotopes ratios of precipitation in Central-Eastern Africa	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We report the first delta O-18 and delta H-2 data of Virunga rainfall in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated on the limit between Central and Eastern Africa. The dataset is from 13 rain gauges deployed at Mount Nyiragongo and its surroundings sampled monthly between December 2013 and October 2015. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 vary from -6.44 to 6.16%., and -32.53 to 58.89%., respectively, and allowed us to define a LMWL of delta H-2 = 7.60 delta O-18 + 16.18. Three main wind directions, i.e. NE, E and SE, were identified in the upper atmosphere corresponding to three major moisture source regions. On the contrary, lower atmospheric winds are weaker in nature and originate mainly from the S and SW, creating a topographically-driven, more local moisture regime. The latter is due to the accumulation in the floor of the rift of water vapor from Lake Kivu forming a layer of isotopically enriched vapor that mediates the isotope enrichment of the falling raindrops. A strong seasonality is observed in both delta O-18 and delta H-2 data, and is primarily driven by combined seasonal and spatial variation in the moisture sources. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 seasonality is thus correlated to weather patterns, as the latter control the wet to dry season shifting, and vice versa. The key characteristic of seasonality is the variation of monthly precipitation amounts, since the mean monthly air temperature is nearly constant on an annual scale. Two regionally relevant hydrological processes contribute to the isotopic signature: namely moisture uptake from the isotopically enriched surface waters of East African lakes and from the depleted soil-water and plants. Consequently, the proportion of water vapor from each of these reservoirs in the atmosphere drives the enrichment or depletion of delta H-2 and delta O-18 in the precipitation. Thus, during wet periods the vapor from soil-plants evapotranspiration dominates yielding isotopically depleted precipitation, contrary to dry periods when vapor from lakes surface evaporation dominates, yielding isotopically enriched precipitation. At the global scale, our dataset reduces gaps in this region that has been poorly studied for delta O-18 and delta H-2 in precipitation. At the regional scale, the improved understanding of the ways land cover, moisture source seasonal and spatial dynamics, and atmospheric patterns impact precipitation spatial and temporal variabilities in Central-East African will contribute to the ongoing research on mitigating the impacts of ongoing climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. The reduction of gaps and uncertainties in delta H-2 and delta O-18 of precipitation, and the understanding of their interrelation with weather patterns are essential for a better past, present and future environmental and climatic modelling at both local and regional scales.

J	Riley, SC; Adams, JV				Riley, Stephen C.; Adams, Jean V.			Long-Term Trends in Habitat Use of Offshore Demersal Fishes in Western Lake Huron Suggest Large-Scale Ecosystem Change	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We estimated mean depths of capture for offshore demersal fish species, grouped into three habitat-based guilds (shallow benthic, pelagic, and deep benthic), using fall bottom trawl data (27-73 m) in the western main basin of Lake Huron from 1976 to 2007. The mean depth of capture of the shallow and deep benthic guilds initially exhibited a trend toward capture in shallower water, switched to a trend toward capture in deeper water in 1991, and changed back to a trend toward capture in shallower water in 2001-2002. Species in the pelagic guild showed a similar pattern, but the initial change point occurred in 1981 for this guild. Individual species in these guilds showed variable patterns of depth distribution, but a feature common to all guilds and all pelagic and deep benthic species was a change to a trend toward capturing fish in shallower water that occurred nearly simultaneously (1999-2002). These common trends suggest that large-scale factors are affecting the habitat use of offshore demersal fish species in Lake Huron. The depth distributions of the three guilds have converged in recent years, indicating that the locations of suitable habitat for offshore demersal fishes may be changing. Our results indicate that the benthic ecology of the western main basin of Lake Huron is undergoing profound changes across a large spatial scale that are affecting the habitat use of offshore demersal fishes. We suggest that these changes are related to recent invasions of exotic species.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2010	139	5					1322	1334		10.1577/T09-090.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T09-090.1													WOS:000282594000007
S	Maley, J		Runge, J		Maley, Jean			Climate and palaeoenvironment evolution in north tropical Africa from the end of the Tertiary to the Upper Quaternary	AFRICAN PALAEOENVIRONMENTS AND GEOMORPHIC LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION	Palaeoecology of Africa											Desert conditions appeared in the Sahara between 10 and 7 million years ago (Ma) following a long savanna environment phase that lasted from the beginning of the Oligocene to the end of the Miocene. Starting at about 7 My and up until the Late Quaternary, environmental conditions varied in a cyclical manner, wherein humid milieus succeeded semi-arid and finally desertic ones. This succession presented a periodicity between 20.000 and 24.000 years, which allows a link to an orbital forcing. The oldest prehistoric industries found in the Sahara belong to the Late Acheulean, between 600.000 and 300.000 years. These were succeeded by Middle Stone Age industries until about 70.000 years, then they evolved towards the Late Stone Age before the Last Great Arid phase synchronous with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The last great humid phase of the Late Quaternary, which is described in detail, occurred after the LGM between ca. 15.000 and 4.500 years cal BP. This phase was not homogeneously humid, as it was interrupted by arid periods sometimes accompanied by eolian reactivation. In the Chad Basin, the humid conditions led to the formation of an immense Mega-Chad Lake during the Middle Holocene. A distinctly less important, final lacustrine phase intervened at the beginning of the Late Holocene. There was also an important erosive phase between ca. 2.400 and 1.900 cal BP; this phase is worth mentioning because it is found up to the equatorial zone where it was associated with a strong contraction of the forest, and in particular with the formation of a savanna corridor through the Congolian Forest area. The last two Millennia are studied in detail and using, in particular, diverse historical data, a relatively precise reconstruction of the variation in Lake Chad levels during the last Millennium is provided. For the latter period, there are quite good correlations between variation curves of solar activity and of Lake Chad levels. In the second part of this paper various palaeoclimatic interpretations are presented to try to explain the humid phases, in particular. Indeed these phases seem to result not only from the reinforcement of the annual Monsoon, but also, during the cooler inter-seasons, from Extratropical Cyclonic Depressions known as "Saharan Depressions". Precise quite monthly isotopic data obtained from gastropod shell dated to the Middle Holocene clearly show two rainy seasons during the course of a year-one relatively long, tied to the annual Monsoon and a second shorter one, which might be referred to Saharan Depressions.																			2372-5907		978-0-203-84527-1; 978-0-415-58789-1				2011	30						227	278																WOS:000355935100015

In the fall, the rates of glucose mineralization by the planktonic microflora of Bethel Lake [Ontario, Canada] followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics at the in situ pH (7.5) and at the 2 experimental pH (5.5 and 5.0). Turnover times for glucose increased with decreasing pH and, correpondingly, Vmax values decreased with decreasing pH. During ice-cover, only the in situ pH (6.85) gave a Michaelis-Menten response for glucose mineralization. At the experimental pH glucose mineralization activity was negligible. Analyses for soluble Cu and Ni, the most important heavy metals in this environment with respect to concentration, indicated that the reduced glucose mineralization rates were to the result of acidification increasing the heavy metal concentrations (and their toxicity). For the acid-stressed Silver Lake [Ontario, Canada], glucose mineralization was negligible at the in situ pH (4.3) and at the experimental pH (5.5 and 7.0) as well. The application of this method in the study of acid-stressed lakes was discussed.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1983	17	10					1379	1384		10.1016/0043-1354(83)90267-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(83)90267-1													WOS:A1983RJ42300024

Concurrently, coliforms and fecal coliforms bacteria were also measured. Occasionally several large drinking water volumes were tested for enteric viruses and the above bacteriophages. Sampling site cluster shows good correlation between bacteriophages and bacterial indicators, as pollution index. Water from the three main supply sources showed increased bacteriophage presence as follows: well > lake > spring. Mixture of the three water supplies revealed different contamination frequency. Bacteriophages' presence in drinking water presumably points to contamination of these sources. Results of a different study on groundwater aquifer recharged with reused water, and retained for more than 20 months before being drawn out, showed absence of these bacteriophages. The current results correlate with other studies, indicating that filtration is a necessary step in water treatment With the introduction of full scale filtration units in the near future, it is expected to find a decline in the presence of these bacteriophages in drinking water in Israel. Following additional studies, use of suggested E.coli bacteriophages of type male-specific (F+) similar to coliforms and B.fragilis bacteriophages to fecal coliforms as pollution index of drinking water, in addition to classical indicators.

Quaternary volcanism covers a significant area in Eastern Anatolia where Holocene and historical activity have been reported. Nemrut Caldera is one of the youngest volcanoes in the region, with a small-size collapse caldera forming a spectacular landscape. Mount Nemrut is characterized by extension-related peralkaline volcanism in this well-known continental-collisional setting. Following the collapse of the Quaternary caldera, the activity continued within the caldera and at the northern fissure zone. Post-caldera activity shaping the intra-caldera region is represented by domes, lava flows and phreatic/phreatomagmatic explosions. While the products of this activity cover the eastern part of the caldera, the western half of the caldera is filled with a fresh volcanic lake. Hydrothermal activity is marked with fumaroles and hot springs in the caldera. The northern fissure zone produced the youngest effusive activity in Anatolia. Bimodal fissural activity is characterized by successive rhyolite and basalt flows. Historical and mythological records of the Nemrut volcanism are scattered in a wide historical time span. During the Quaternary, Mount Nemrut and Suphan have contributed to the gradual enclosure of Van Lake Basin. They are located on the divide separating the Van Lake Basin from the Murat-Euphrates drainage basin. Products of explosive volcanism of Nemrut Caldera filled the Bitlis and Guzeldere valleys, separating the Van Lake Basin from the Dicle-Tigris hydrosystem.

J	Lin, L; Demirbilek, Z; Mausolf, G				Lin, Lihwa; Demirbilek, Zeki; Mausolf, Gregory			Numerical Modeling of Sedimentation by Storm Waves at Sand Island in Lake Superior, Wisconsin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												This paper describes numerical modeling of the combined wave-flow-sedimentation conducted for relocation and design of a marine boat dock facility located at the eastern shore of Sand Island in the southwestern region of Lake Superior in USA. The present boat dock is situated near a creek that supplies watershed sediments and occasional landslides which cause intermittent burial of land-connection section of the dock facility. The U.S. Department of Interior's National Park Service is considering a new dock location south of the existing dock to avoid future potential sedimentation from the nearby creek. The role and impacts of local winds, waves, currents, and water levels affect utilization of the new dock. The relocated dock is investigated in the present study using the Coastal Modeling System, an integrated numerical modeling system that includes a spectral wave model and a depth-averaged circulation model with sediment transport calculations. The modeling considers winter storms for two real time periods and a representative condition for 50-yr design return period. The study results are quantified in terms of differences for waves, currents and morphological changes between the existing dock and relocation site. The shadowing effect of the northern headland on waves at these sites was investigated. Results showed minor differences between the existing dock and relocated dock for nearshore waves, current speeds and bed changes.																			0972-9984	0973-7308					2016	31	1					1	31																WOS:000374233800001

This paper presents the results of CZMIL system validation in turbid water conditions along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and in relatively clear water conditions in Florida in late spring 2012. Results of the USACE May-October 2012 mission in Green Bay, WI and Lake Erie are presented. The system performance tests show that CZMIL successfully achieved 7-8m depth in Mississippi with K-d =0.46m(-1) (Kd is the diffuse attenuation coefficient) and up to 41m in Florida when K-d=0.11m(-1). Bathymetric accuracy of CZMIL was measured by comparing CZMIL depths with multi-beam sonar data from Cat Island, MS and from off the coast of Fort. Lauderdale, FL. Validation demonstrated that CZMIL meets USACE specifications (two standard deviation, 2 sigma, similar to 30 cm). To measure topographic accuracy we made direct comparisons of CZMIL elevations to GPS-surveyed ground control points and vehicle-based lidar scans of topographic surfaces. Results confirmed that CZMIL meets the USACE topographic requirements (2 sigma, similar to 15 cm). Upon completion of the Green Bay and Lake Erie mission there were 89 flights with 2231 flightlines. The general hours of aircraft engine time (which doesn't include all transit/ferry flights) was 441 hours with 173 hours of time on survey flightlines. The 4.8 billion (!) laser shots and 38.6 billion digitized waveforms covered over 1025 miles of shoreline.					ramnath, vinod/Q-1457-2015														0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9515-0				2013	8724								87240A	10.1117/12.2017935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2017935													WOS:000323517900010
J	Öztürk, H				Öztürk, H			Metropolitan development on drought history of the Tuzla Lake, Istanbul, Turkey	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The coastal environment has changed in the past 25 years relation to the industrial and human settlement around the Tuzla Lake, Istanbul, Turkey. At first, the inlet of the Tuzla Lagoon Lake was filled and isolated from the sea, and changed to a fresh water lake. This was followed by chanelling of dirty creeks and a tunnel construction 8 m below the sea level just behind the lake. These engineering constructions resulted in a 3 m fall of ground water level in 4 years around the lake and, as a result a drought occurred in June, 2001. During this period, salty water encroachment and groundwater saltation occurred and farmlands faced significant irrigation problems. After the drought, two connection pipe lines were constructed between the sea and the lake. However, these pipes were filled by sea originated material, mostly shells, within a year and water exchange between the lake and the sea became impossible. As a result, environmental equilibrium has been disturbed and farming habits have changed. The investigations on the lake mud after the drought reveal that sedimentation rate has been about 1cm/year for past 25 years. A bed rich in shrimp skeletons observed within the lake mud indicates significant pollutant introduction into the lake from industrial or agricultural activities.					; Öztürk, Hüseyin/D-7710-2019	OZTURK, HUSEYIN/0000-0001-7290-1279; 													0749-0208					MAR	2005	21	2					255	262		10.2112/03-0074.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/03-0074.1													WOS:000228842800004

Colloids in Thermokarst Lakes along a Permafrost and Climate Gradient of Permafrost Peatlands in Western Siberia Using In Situ Dialysis Procedure	WATER												Thermokarst lakes in the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL) are major environmental factors controlling organic carbon and trace metal storage in inland waters and greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. In contrast to previously published research devoted to lake hydrochemistry, hydrobiology, sedimentary carbon, and processes controlling the lake total dissolved (<0.45 mu m) solute composition, the colloidal forms of organic carbon (IC), and related elements remain poorly known, especially across the permafrost gradient in this environmentally important region. Here we sampled 38 thermokarst lakes in the WSL, from the continuous to the permafrost-free zone, and we assessed both the total (<0.45 mu m) and low-molecular-weight (<1 kDa) concentrations of 50 major and trace elements using conventional filtration and in situ dialysis. We aimed at quantifying the relationships between the colloidal content of an element and the lake surface area, permafrost coverage (absent, sporadic, isolated, discontinuous, and continuous), pH, and the concentrations of the main colloidal constituents, such as OC, Fe, and Al. There was a positive correlation between the lake area and the contents of the colloidal fractions of DOC, Ni, rare earth elements (REE), and Hf, which could be due to the enhanced mobilization of OC, trace metals, and lithogenic elements from silicate minerals in the soil porewater within the lake watershed and peat abrasion at the lake border. In all permafrost zones, the colloidal fractions of alkalis and alkaline-earth metals decreased with an increase in lake size, probably due to a decrease in the DOC concentration in large lakes. There was an increase in the colloidal fractions of DOC, Fe, Al, trivalent and tetravalent trace cations, Mn, Co, Ni, As, V, and U from the southern, permafrost-free zone to the northern, permafrost-bearing zones. This observation could be explained by an enhanced feeding of thermokarst lakes by suprapermafrost flow and the thawing of dispersed peat ice in the northern regions. Considering the large permafrost gradient of thermokarst lakes sampled in the present study, and applying a space-for-time substitution approach, we do not anticipate sizable changes in the colloidal status of DOC or major or trace elements upon climate warming and the permafrost boundary shifting northwards. For incorporating the obtained results into global biogeochemical models of OC, metal micronutrients, and toxicant migration in the permafrost regions, one has to consider the connectivity among lakes, soil waters, and rivers. For this, measurements of lake colloids across the main hydrological seasons, notably the winter period, are necessary.

Thermal alteration and macroinvertebrate response below a large Northern Great Plains reservoir	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Large hydroelectric dams directly alter the abiotic condition of rivers by releasing water with large differences in temperature relative to natural conditions. These alterations in the thermal regime along with alterations in flow often result in altered ecosystems downstream. For sustainable management of this aquatic resource, there is a need to balance services a reservoir provides with ecosystem protection. Here we conduct a high-resolution study on the thermal regime and associated aquatic macroinvertebrate community downstream of a hydroelectric dam on a large-order Northern Great Plains River and analyze these findings with a non-central hypothesis test model, Test Site Analysis. Specifically, we monitor the temperature regime of this tailwater environment, and compare the annual change in temperature downstream to reference sites unaffected by the dam. We find that reaches downstream of the dam are significantly cooler than reference through the summer into August and do not reach the temperature optima of reference reaches. Cold-water release, or some other change in flow characteristics, changes abundance, diversity, % Orthocladiinae, and community composition. We used these metrics to compare test sites to reference sites and to quantify the impact of the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir on community metrics characteristic of temperature stress. Our results have implications primarily for understanding and quantifying the ecosystem impacts of hydroelectric energy production, but also range expansion of cold-water tolerant taxa, the life-history of select groups of invertebrates, and ultimately the forage resources available to the fish assemblages of this river system.

An oligotrophic arctic lake was fertilised with inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus as (NH4)(2) NO3 and H3PO4 for five summers. The loading rate was 1.7-2.5 mmol N m(-2) day(-1) and 0.136-0.20 mmol p m(-2) day(-1) which is two to three times the annual loading of lakes in the area. The heterotrophic microzooplankton community was enumerated during the experiment as well as 1 year pre- and post-treatment. 2. The structure of the microplankton community changed from a nutrient limited system, dominated by oligotrich protozoans and small-particle feeding rotifers, to a system dominated by a succession of peritrich protozoans and predatory rotifers. These peritrich protozoans and predatory rotifers were not present prior to fertilisation. and never constituted more than a small fraction of the biomass in other lakes at the research site. The average biomass of the rotifers and protozoans was more than seven and a half times larger by the end of fertilisation than it was initially. 3. Because of the increases in numbers of individuals in these new taxa, the structure of the microbial food web changed. When fertilisation stopped, most parameters returned to prefertilisation levels within 1 year.

George			Has Alberta Oil Sands Development Altered Delivery of Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds to the Peace-Athabasca Delta?	PLOS ONE												Background: The extent to which Alberta oil sands mining and upgrading operations have enhanced delivery of bitumen-derived contaminants via the Athabasca River and atmosphere to the Peace-Athabasca Delta (200 km to the north) is a pivotal question that has generated national and international concern. Accounts of rare health disorders in residents of Fort Chipewyan and deformed fish in downstream ecosystems provided impetus for several recent expert-panel assessments regarding the societal and environmental consequences of this multi-billion-dollar industry. Deciphering relative contributions of natural versus industrial processes on downstream supply of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) has been identified as a critical knowledge gap. But, this remains a formidable scientific challenge because loading from natural processes remains unknown. And, industrial activity occurs in the same locations as the natural bitumen deposits, which potentially confounds contemporary upstream-downstream comparisons of contaminant levels. Methods/Principal Findings: Based on analyses of lake sediment cores, we provide evidence that the Athabasca Delta has been a natural repository of PACs carried by the Athabasca River for at least the past two centuries. We detect no measureable increase in the concentration and proportion of river-transported bitumen-associated indicator PACs in sediments deposited in a flood-prone lake since onset of oil sands development. Results also reveal no evidence that industrial activity has contributed measurably to sedimentary concentration of PACs supplied by atmospheric transport. Conclusions/Significance: Findings suggest that natural erosion of exposed bitumen in banks of the Athabasca River and its tributaries is a major process delivering PACs to the Athabasca Delta, and the spring freshet is a key period for contaminant mobilization and transport. This baseline environmental information is essential for informed management of natural resources and human-health concerns by provincial and federal regulatory agencies and industry, and for designing effective long-term monitoring programs for the lower Athabasca River watershed.

J	Clark, JM; Chapman, PJ; Heathwaite, AL; Adamson, JK				Clark, JM; Chapman, PJ; Heathwaite, AL; Adamson, JK			Suppression of dissolved organic carbon by sulfate induced acidification during simulated droughts	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the acidification of soils and freshwaters by sulfate (SO42-) has been a topic of great debate over the last few decades. Most interest has focused on long-term acidification. Few have considered the influence of episodic drought-induced acidification in peatlands on DOC mobility, even through the increased acidity and ionic strength associated with the oxidation of reduced sulfur to SO42- are known to reduce DOC solubility. Reduced DOC concentrations during droughts have often been attributed to: (i) reduced hydrological export; (ii) physicochemical changes in the peat structure; or(iii) changes in the biological production and/or consumption of DOC. Our experimental drought simulations on peat cores showed that SO42- induced acidification reduced DOC concentrations during droughts, However, the relationships between SO42-/pH/ ionic strength and DOC were only apparent when the reductions in observed DOC were expressed as a fraction of the estimated DOC concentration in the absence of S 204, which were derived from soil depth, temperature, and watertable data. This analysis showed that a pH fall from 4.3 to 3.5, due to a SO42- rise from < 2.5 to 35 mg L-1, caused a 60% reduction in DOC concentrations. In contrast, poor correlations were recorded between SO42-/pH/ionic strength and the observed DOC data. As DOC both influences acidity and is influenced by acidity, the relative change in DOC needed to be considered to disentangle the effect of inputs of mineral acids into a system naturally dominated by variable concentrations of organic acids.					; Clark, Joanna/C-7523-2009; Heathwaite, Ann/F-7002-2014; Heathwaite, Ann Louise/F-7002-2014	Chapman, Pippa/0000-0003-0438-6855; Clark, Joanna/0000-0002-0412-8824; Heathwaite, Ann Louise/0000-0001-8791-0039													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 15	2006	40	6					1776	1783		10.1021/es051488c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es051488c								16570597					WOS:000236213900011

Scanning electron microscope examination of trawl-net and filtered samples demonstrated bacterial association with Anabaena Aphanizomenon and diatoms. Direct counts of associated and unassociated bacteria showed that increases in bacterial population relate to population decline of major algal constituents. Spectrophotometric determination of selected cation levels in the lake water demonstrated wide fluctuations throughout the sampling period, with elevated levels of transition metals before and at the end of summer stratification. Zn and Pb also showed increased levels in relation to episodic events. Mass fractions of spectrophotometrically-determined selected cations (Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb) in phytoplankton also varied considerably during the sampling period, with major increases apparently following peaks in water level. X-ray microanalysis of whole, unassociated bacterial cells demonstrated high levels of soluble and bound cations, including K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn and Pb. Changes in the cation levels of bacteria did not follow a similar pattern to the general phytoplankton.sbd.probably due to differences in uptake or adsorption or to cycling of bacterial cells in the water column.

In lake-wide modelling of large lakes with many sources of microbial contamination, minor contributions from small tributaries are generally ignored. In this study, we applied a three dimensional high-resolution hydrodynamic and water quality model to assess the impact of eight smaller tributaries located on the southern edge of Lake St. Clair on microbial water quality during the summer of 2016. The impact at two beaches and two drinking water intakes located in the nearshore region of the southern edge of Lake St. Clair was considered. Results reveal that the microbial water quality in the nearshore regions close to these eight small tributaries' confluence are significantly affected by one or more of these tributaries. Although this effect is captured by our model with a time-variable or constant decay rates, the use of time-variable decay may be preferable for dynamic simulations over time. The total flow contribution from the smaller tributaries was estimated in the range of 18-35% while that for E. coli concentration was >80%. Three small tributaries were also predicted to account for >70% of the E. coli concentrations at drinking water intakes. For tributaries that do not significantly affect the hydrodynamics in a lake, a new framework is presented to identify approximate influence zones for microbial pollution that can help determine if a given location is likely to be impacted by the inflowing tributaries.

J	Townsend, PA; Eshleman, KN; Welcker, C				Townsend, PA; Eshleman, KN; Welcker, C			Remote sensing of gypsy moth defoliation to assess variations in stream nitrogen concentrations	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Disturbance is an important mechanism controlling dissolved nitrogen (N) leakage to receiving streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries from forested watersheds. In oak forests of the eastern United States, defoliation by the gypsy moth caterpillar represents a recurring disturbance regime that can impact water quality. Following an upsurge in gypsy moth activity in the mid-Appalachian region in 2000-2001, we examined the relationship between defoliation and N export within the Fifteenmile Creek watershed in Maryland and Pennsylvania using intensive stream surveys and remotely sensed imagery. Concentrations of dissolved N species were determined six times during seasonal baseflow and once during stormflow conditions at the outlet of 35 randomly selected sub-watersheds between April 2001 and June 2002. Summer Landsat images were used to characterize forest disturbance within each of the sub-watersheds in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Quantitative differences in imagery between the defoliation years of 2000 and 2001 (and 1999, a non-defoliation year) derived from change vector analysis provided indices of forest change. Dissolved N concentrations in the 35 reaches were dominated by nitrate-N (average 61%, ranging 19-89% of total dissolved nitrogen), although dissolved organic nitrogen was present at measurable levels (0.03-0.16 mg/L). Percent non-forested land cover accounted for only 8-33% of the spatial variation in nitrate-N concentrations, while multivariate models that also included change vector statistics from satellite imagery (magnitude and angular direction of image change) accounted for 72-80% of the spatial variation in nitrate-N concentrations. Measurements of defoliation during both the current and (when appropriate) previous year were statistically significant and indicated the importance of defoliation for increasing N inputs to the system at unseasonably high rates as a consequence of the deposition of caterpillar frass: Jackknifed residuals. were within 25% of the actual measurements, indicating that remote sensing models could be used to predict variations in N concentrations for ungauged watersheds in the region. Our results provide more evidence that the remote sensing approach is a valuable component in predicting spatially varying relationships between ecosystem status and water quality conditions at the regional scale, thereby allowing assessments of watershed disturbances as part of land management.

A total number of 109 glaciers (187 +/- 3.7 km(2)) are mapped and subsequently classified as compound valley glaciers, simple valley glaciers, cirques, niches, glacieretes and ice aprons. The compound and simple valley glaciers contribute 67.1 +/- 1.3% and 19.8 +/- 0.3% to the total glacier cover of the basin. Similarly, a total number of 129 glacial lakes (0.360 +/- 0.007 km(2)) are identified. From 1976 to 2011, the compound valley glaciers have lost a small area of 10.3 +/- 0.03% at a rate of 0.41 +/- 0.002 km(2) a(-1), whereas the niche glaciers have lost higher area of 40.1 +/- 0.001% at a rate of 0.04 +/- 0.0001 km(2) a(-1). Change detection of two benchmark glacial lakes revealed a progressive expansion during recent decades. The Baspa Bamak proglacial lake has expanded from 0.020 +/- 0.0004 km(2) (2000) to 0.069 +/- 0.001 km(2) (2011). Due to the complete loss of source ice, another glacial lake has expanded from 0.09 +/- 0.001 km(2) (1994) to 0.10 +/- 0.002 km(2) (2011). During the study period, the mean annual temperature that is T-avg, T-min and T-max have increased significantly at the 95% confidence level by 1.5 C-o (0.070 degrees C a(-1)), 1.8 C-o (0.076 degrees C a(-1)) and 1.6 C-o (0.0071 degrees C a(-1)) from 1985 to 2008.

However, it would be wrong to believe that this established view can be applied to all lakes. Certainly the transformations of phosphorus in the summer epilimnia of small, coloured, humic forest lakes in southern Finland show features which deviate markedly from the generally accepted paradigm. (1) The plankton appears to be limited simultaneously by P and N rather than being strongly P limited. (2) Particulate P is typically a rather small fraction of the total P. (3) Molybdate reactive P may be a large part of the total P, although much of this MRP is not free orthophosphate, especially in highly humic lakes. (4) Turnover times for PO4-P are normally long (50-1000 minutes); turnover times appear to be longer in highly humic lakes. (5) Added (PO4)-P-32 passes rapidly to macrozooplankton, apparently with rapid turnover of zooplankton phosphorus. (6) Sedimentation of phosphorus from the typically shallow epilimnion appears high, but may be partially compensated by biological retrieval of phosphorus from the phosphorus-rich hypolimnion.

Shallow coastal areas under high anthropogenic pressure are particularly vulnerable to water quality deterioration. This work presents the development of a two-dimensional ecological model of the processes in the Orbetello Lagoon (central Italy), a highly eutrophic coastal basin subject to several human-induced and natural stressors. The ecological model, coupled with a hydrodynamic model, simulates the nutrient cycle in the water column and in the sediment, the growth and decay of rooted vegetation, macroalgae, phytoplankton, and zooplankton, as well as the oxygen cycle. Once calibrated and validated with field measurements, the model has been used as a decision-support tool for lagoon management, providing qualitative insights into the impact of various stress factors and intervention actions. This study allowed the quantification of the effects on dissolved oxygen of different interventions (pumping systems, removal of obstructions at inlets, channels dredging), proving that the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration in the lagoon in the summer months is relevantly affected by the human intervention on the system.

Potamogeton crispus (P. crispus), a species that germinates in winter, explosively expanded throughout many Chinese lakes, yet the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here, this study examined the long-term changes in the distribution patterns of P. crispus in Lake Gaoyou by combining remote sensing images and hydrometeorological data from 1984 to 2022 and water quality data from 2009 to 2022. It aims to unravel the relationships between the distribution patterns of P. crispus and hydrometeorological and water quality factors. The results showed that the area of P. crispus in Lake Gaoyou showed a slight increase from 1984 to 2009, a marked increase from 2010 to 2019, followed by a decline after 2020. Spatially, P. crispus was primarily distributed in the western and northern parts of Lake Gaoyou, with less distribution in the central and southeastern parts of the lake. Wind speed (WS), temperature (Temp), water level (WL), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and Secchi depth (SD) were identified as the key factors regulating the variation in the P. crispus area in Lake Gaoyou. We found that the P. crispus area showed an increasing trend with increasing Temp, WL, and SD and decreasing WS and NH3-N. The influence of environmental factors on the area of P. crispus in Lake Gaoyou varied among seasons. The results indicated that hydrometeorology (WS, Temp, and WL) may override water quality (NH3-N and SD) in driving the succession of P. crispus distribution.

This research first provided two sets of long-term comprehensive observational datasets, and an advanced monitoring technique to measure soil moisture, which can improve the estimation accuracy of evapotranspiration. Subsequently, using microwave data, the Surface Energy Balance System model and Machine Learning methods, it calculated a complete set of long-term evapotranspiration data. At the same time, based on reasonable assumptions, it also estimated the total evaporation from plateau lakes. These findings contribute significantly to the understanding of the relationship between the Asian monsoon, the TP's physical characteristics, and its atmosphere, thereby improving predictions of water resource variability in the TP. The study's innovative methodologies and synthesis of diverse data sources provide critical information for informed and sustainable water management strategies in the region.

Development and Evaluation of a New Predictive Model for Metamorphosis of Great Lakes Larval Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) Populations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Accurate forecasts of the number of larval sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) within a stream that will enter into metamorphosis are critical to currently used methods for allocating lampricide treatments among streams in the Great Lakes basin. To improve our ability to predict metamorphosis we used a mark-recapture technique, involving the marking of individual larval lamprey with sequentially coded wire tags, to combine information regarding individual and stream level parameters collected in year t, with direct observations of metamorphic outcome of lamprey recaptured in year t+1. We used these data to fit predictive models of metamorphosis. The best model demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities and highlighted the importance of weight, age, larval density, stream temperature and geographic location in determining when individual lamprey are likely to tran. form. While this model was informative, it required data whose measures are not practical to obtain routinely during the larval sea lamprey assessment program. A second model, limited to data inputs that can be easily obtained, was developed and included length of larvae the fall prior to metamorphosis, stream latitude and longitude, drainage area, average larval density in type-2 habitat, and stream lamprey production category (a measure of the regularity with which treatments are required). This model accurately predicted metamorphosis 20% more often than current models of metamorphosis; however, we recommend further validation on an independent set of streams before adoption by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission for ranking streams.

SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY												The purpose of this article is to alert physicians for the environmental and health threats of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) in Switzerland. Switzerland borders several heavily ragweed colonised areas. Up to 12% of the population suffers from allergies (hay fever, asthma) to ragweed pollen in these areas. Switzerland is beginning to be invaded by this plant. Currently, the ragweed pollen counts are still low but can reach local peaks that induce symptoms in allergic individuals. Ragweed allergy, however, is still rare in Switzerland. Because the amount of ragweed pollen was increasing in the last few years, identification and surveillance of ragweed plant foci was started. Colonisation is currently systematically monitored in Geneva and southern Tessin. Major accumulation of ragweed foci have been detected in the canton of Geneva, the western shore of the lake of Geneva belonging to the canton of Vaud, and in the southern part of the canton of Tessin, aside from minor foci registered all over Switzerland. The routes of ragweed invasion are presented and discussed. Current measures of ragweed containment and needs for the future are presented. The urge for these measures at an early stage of ragweed spread is underlined by the impracticability of eradication in highly colonised areas. The costs of preventing ragweed spread in Switzerland are likely to be several magnitudes lower than the treatment of a significant percentage of the Swiss population for ragweed pollen allergy. Because areas can change from low to heavy ragweed colonisation within a few years, the current window of opportunity to prevent further colonisation by ragweed should not be missed.

Vegetation change and human impacts on Rebun Island (Northwest Pacific) over the last 6000 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This study presents a high-resolution, chronologically well-constrained pollen record from Lake Kushu (45 degrees 25'58"N, 141 degrees 02'05"E) and a record of archaeobotanical remains from the nearby Hamanaka 2 archaeological site. The pollen record suggests continuous long-term cooling, which parallels the decline in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. This cooling trend is overlaid by several rather quick transitions towards cooler conditions (ca. 5540/5350, 1550, and 390 cal BP) and one distinct decadalscale cold event around 4130 cal BP. These shifts, on one hand, correspond with major hemispherical or global-scale climate transitions/events, including the 'Holocene Climate Transition', the onset of the 'Dark Ages Cold Period' main phase, the 'Little Ice Age', and the '4.2 kiloyear event', respectively. On the other hand, the shifts partly coincide with transformations in the Hokkaido prehistoric cultural sequence including the onset of the Middle Jomon (ca. 5000 cal BP), the Middle/Late Jomon transition (ca. 4000 cal BP), the immigration of Okhotsk culture groups (from ca. 1500 cal BP), and the establishment of the Classic Ainu culture (ca. 350 cal BP). AMS radiocarbon dating of charred macrobotanical remains from Hamanaka 2 suggests three discontinuous occupational periods ca. 390-50 BCE, 420-970 CE, and from 1640 CE, which correspond to the northern Hokkaido Epi Jomon (ca. 300-100 BCE), Okhotsk (ca. 500 1000 CE), and Classic Ainu (ca. 1600-1868 CE) cultural phases, respectively. While impact on the island's natural environments (forest clearance) was marginal during the Epi Jomon phase, it became significant during the Okhotsk and the Classic Ainu culture phases.

J	Mouthon, J				Mouthon, J			Life cycle and population dynamics of Pisidium subtruncatum MALM (Bivalvia: Sphaeriidae) in the Saone, a large lowland river, at Lyon (France): Environmental influences	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The Pisidium subtruncatum population of the Saone River at Lyon was sampled every month from September 1996 to December 2000. The life cycle of this bivalve is characterised by the appearance of five cohorts that succeeded each other from May to September-October. The longevity of the two first cohorts was only 3 months, whereas the longevity of the three others, which lived though the winter, reached 11 months. We generally observed two to three young release periods for each cohort (iteroparity). Pisidium usually produces one or two cohorts per year and lives from one to four years. The temperatures of the Saone are higher than those of the generally lacustrine habitats of populations studied by others, explaining the disagreement between these results and those of other authors. The magnitude and duration of the floods and the periods when they occur play a decisive role in the population dynamics of this bivalve and can, as in 1999, greatly disturb its life cycle. The increase of litter size when density is very low suggests that this species possesses compensation mechanisms that permit readjusting population density after a major decrease.																			0003-9136					AUG	2005	163	4					539	554		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0539													WOS:000231910100007

The aim was to establish whether daphnids selected the filaments in a certain length range or ingested them indiscriminately regardless of size. We also investigated the effect of Daphnia body size on filament size selection. Both large-sized cladocerans, i.e. Daphnia spp., and the filamentous alga Ulothrix sp. were abundant in spring period (February-May 2004). We simultaneously investigated and compared the length distributions of Ulothrix in the lake and the guts of daphnids that varied in size. The maximum lengths of Ulothrix filaments ingested by each size class of daphnids varying in length from 0.75 to 2.90 mm ranged from 380 and 1030 mm; a range that is quite similar to the size ranges of filaments found in the lake. Also the size frequency of the filaments in Daphnia guts versus those in the lake did not differ significantly. The number of filaments in the guts of individual daphnids ranged from 0 to 668. Our results demonstrated that daphnids (>0.75 mm) did not feed selectivity on a certain length range of filaments but rather do so in proportion to their availability in the lake. Daphnids <0.75 mm did not feed on Ulothrix filaments.

Animals from locations on the island where free water is completely absent were compared in midsummer with animals from sites where brackish water is available and utilized by the quokkas. In the animals from West End, where free water is absent, circulating levels of LVP averaged 89.2 .+-. 19.6 pg/ml, which was significantly higher than the mean level of 35.6 .+-. 15.8 pg/ml measured in individuals collected from the Lakes site with access to brackish drinking water. Rates if water and sodium turnover, measured with isotopes, were significantly greater in Lakes than West End animals, as were renal clearances of sodium, chloride, urea, and total osmolytes. Despite an obvious osmotic diuresis resulting from the ingestion of salty water, the Lakes animals were in better physical condition at the end of summer than the West End animals which lack free water, and these latter individuals showed signs of slight dehydration with elevated plasma and urinary electrolyte concentrations and osmolalities.					; Watts, Robyn/C-1288-2009	Jones, Margaret/0000-0002-0678-3187; Bradshaw, Sidney/0000-0001-9068-4060; Watts, Robyn/0000-0002-3526-7261													0016-6480	1095-6840				JAN	1990	77	1					75	87		10.1016/0016-6480(90)90208-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-6480(90)90208-4								2295426					WOS:A1990CD86000010

Sea Surface and Hydrological Activity Observed in Titan's Punga Mare	PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL												We present new evidence for active coastal and oceanic features in Titan's Punga Mare observed in a high-phase Cassini Visual Infrared and Mapping Spectrometer observation of sun glint from the T110 flyby. We observe sunglint in a coastal channel, Apanohuaya Flumen, resulting from differing pixel contributions of land adjacent to the liquid-filled channel. Along the eastern shoreline, we identify a 5 mu m bright margin. A possible explanation for this brightening includes a coastal margin of capillary wave fields. We find additional evidence of variegated sea surface roughness in Fundy Sinus and isolated Sun glitter near Hawaiki Insulae. RADAR observations of debouches (where rivers meet bays) within Punga Mare overlap several bright 5 mu m pixels that indicate rough liquid surfaces. We postulate that a change in liquid flow regimes, possibly occurring as surface streamflow or bubble outburst events, may be responsible for surface roughness near these debouches. These observations imply air-sea-land interactions and active hydrology represented by possible streamflow are present in Titan's sea district during the northern summer.																				2632-3338				MAR 1	2025	6	3							74	10.3847/PSJ/adbc9e	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/adbc9e													WOS:001454593300001

We coupled biogeochemical data to functional and phylogenetic analyses to understand how sedimentary parameters characterize the methane cycle vertically and horizontally in the ice-covered bay of the second largest lake in Europe, Lake Onego, Russia. Our results support a heterogeneous winter methane cycle, with higher production and oxidation closest to riverine inputs. Close to the river mouth, the largest numbers of copies of methane-related functional genes pmoA and mcrA were associated with a specific functional community, and methane production potential exceeded oxidation, resulting in 6-10 times higher methane fluxes than in the rest of the bay. The elevated fluxes arise from the spatial differences in quantity and type (lacustrine versus riverine sources) of organic matter. More homogeneity is found toward the open lake, where the sediment is vertically structured into 3 zones: a shallow zone of methane oxidation; a transitional zone (5-10 cm) where anaerobic methane oxidation is dominant; and a methane production zone below. This vertical pattern is structured by the redox gradient and human-induced changes in sedimentary inputs to the bay. Retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequences from Candidatus Methanoperedens and Cand. Methylomirabilis suggest that anaerobic oxidation of methane occurs in these freshwater lake sediments.					; Lyautey, Emilie/OEM-8549-2025; Zobkova, Maria/AAE-2136-2020; Thomas, Camille/HSG-9495-2023; Belkina, Natalia/AAG-2558-2019	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Frossard, Victor/0000-0003-1338-4739; Dubois, Nathalie/0000-0003-2349-0826; Zobkova, Maria/0000-0002-8106-3665; Hofmann, Hilmar/0000-0001-6140-5886; Thomas, Camille/0000-0002-7651-2542; Lyautey, Emilie/0000-0003-0754-197X; Tofield Pasche, Natacha/0000-0002-9578-9301; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2019	9	2			SI		205	226		10.1080/20442041.2018.1500227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2018.1500227													WOS:000482317700007

Large (fivefold) differences in CHLa were observed with highest concentrations in the Upper Mississippi (32.3 +/- A 1.8 mu g L-1), intermediate values in the Missouri (19.7 +/- A 1.1 mu g L-1) and lowest concentrations in the Ohio (6.8 +/- A 0.5 mu g L-1). Inter-annual variation was small in comparison to inter-river differences suggesting that basin-specific factors exert greater control over river-wide CHLa than regional-scale processes influencing climate and discharge. The rivers were characterized by variable but generally low light conditions as indicated by depth-averaged underwater irradiance < 4 E m(-2) day(-1) and high ratios of channel depth to euphotic depth (> 3). Despite poor light conditions, regression analyses revealed that TP was the best single predictor of CHLa (R (2) = 0.40), though models incorporating both light and TP performed better (R (2) = 0.60). Light and nutrient conditions varied widely within rivers and were inversely related, suggesting that riverine phytoplankton may experience shifts in resource limitation during transport. Inferred grazing and sedimentation losses were large yet CHLa concentrations did not decline downriver indicating that growth and loss processes were closely coupled. The contribution by algae to suspended particulate organic matter in these rivers (mean = 41%) was similar to that of lakes (39%) but lower relative to reservoirs (61%).					; Chick, John/R-5718-2019	Aufdenkampe, Anthony/0000-0002-5811-6458; Bukaveckas, Paul/0000-0002-2636-7818													1015-1621	1420-9055				AUG	2011	73	3					419	436		10.1007/s00027-011-0190-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0190-y													WOS:000292970500009

Spatial Analysis of Hydro-chemical And Toxicological Variables of the Balkhash Lake, Kazakhstan.	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The distribution of hydrophysical, hydrochemical and toxicological parameters across the Balkhash Lake waters (Kazakhstan) was studied in summer 2004. The total dissolved solids reached 1080.33436.8 mg/dm(3). The NH4 content in the water was 0.1030.102 mg/dm(3), NO3 -0.4921.379, NO2 - 0.0240.060, P-PO4 - 0.0110.023, P-tot - 0.0210.106, - Fe 0.0100.056, Si - 5.205.76 mg/dm(3). The average concentration of zinc in the water reached 0.017-0.039, copper -0.013-0.022, cadmium -0.0028-0.0044, lead -0.021-0.047, nickel -0.037-0.042, cobalt -0.010-0.017 mg/dm(3). It was concluded that zinc, copper, total phosphorus, iron, nitrites and nitrates enter the Western Balkhash with the Ili River waters. The contribution of copper with the river runoff to the overall level of pollution of the lake is higher than its flow from other sources. The local increase in nickel concentrations in the Western Balkhash is associated with a washoff from the tailings dam. Contamination of the Eastern Balkhash with cobalt, nickel, lead and cadmium predominantly occurs due to the waters of the Karatal River. The constant flow of water in the lake in the direction from west to east together with wind currents have a significant effect on the distribution of pollutants across the water area.

Rotifer communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes, 1983-2006 and factors affecting their composition	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rotifer communities were examined from the open waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes between 1983 and 2006 in the first inter-lake comparison involving all five lakes. Seventy rotifer taxa were found in summer samples, although most (>80%) individuals were drawn from the following taxa: Conochilus unicornis, Polyarthra vulgaris, Keratella cochlearis, Kellicottia longispina, Keratella crassa, Synchaeta spp., Polyarthra major, Ploesoma truncatum, Keratella earlinae, and Keratella quadrata. Distributions of Filinia longiseta and several species of Brachionus and Trichocera were restricted to regions of higher trophy, notably the western basin of Lake Erie, but most taxa were widely distributed, differing in relative dominance rather than presence or absence. Rotifer community structure appeared to respond in tractable ways to differences in trophic state, with the four most common genera exhibited the following preferences, in order of decreasing trophy: Polyarthra, Keratella, Conochilus, and Kellicottia. Recent oligotrophication in Lake Huron was reflected in decreases in Keratella dominance and increased dominance of Conochilus, while in Lake Michigan oligotrophication was associated with decreases in Polyarthra and Keratella and increases in Conochilus, and Kellicottia. In Lake Ontario, the appearance of the exotic predatory Cercopagis pengoi was strongly associated with dramatic reductions in Polyarthra, while more gradual sequential increases in the dominance of Keratella, Conochilus and Kellicottia were probably the result of decreasing trophic state. Bythotrephes was identified in multivariate analyses as correlating strongly with rotifer composition, although only in Lake Michigan was a clear relationship between the predatory cladoceran and rotifer species shifts observed.

Nineteen species were identified, nine of them being the most abundant. According to statistical analyses (cluster and Correspondence Analysis), the distribution of ostracod species in this semi-arid area is mainly controlled by water conductivity and pH. The hydroperiod, sediment type, dissolved oxygen, altitude and vegetation cover play a secondary role. Thus, in semi-permanent waters with conductivity between 4.5 and 5.4 mS/cm and pH from 7.95 to 8.73 the most abundant species is Sarscypridopsis aculeata (Costa). In ponds with water conductivity from 0.3 to 2 mS/cm, pH between 7.1 and 7.78 and dissolved oxygen from 0.1 to 7.95 mg/l, Cypridopsis vidua (Muller) is the most abundant species. When the vegetation cover increases in this type of ponds, Limnocythere inopinata (Baird) and Potamocypris villosa (Jurine) appear as more abundant. Finally, in ponds with conductivity between 0.34 and 2.8 mS/cm and sporadic input of running waters Ilyocypris bradyi Sars, is the most important species. When the internal water current increases in these ponds, Pseudocandona albicans (Brady) appears as most abundant. However, the accumulation of dead organic matter within the bottom sediment of these ponds favours the decrease of dissolved oxygen and the development of Eucypris virens (Jurine). With this work, we contribute to the knowledge of the ostracod biodiversity of this semi-arid environment and the ecological preferences of this group.

J	Wright, DT; Oren, A				Wright, DT; Oren, A			Nonphotosynthetic bacteria and the formation of carbonates and evaporites through time	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												Nonskeletal sedimentary carbonate rocks are an important component of the Precambrian geological record, but consensus on their origin is lacking. Phanerozoic carbonates are almost exclusively biogenic products of shelly fossils, but it has generally been assumed that carbonate rocks deposited before a shelly biota evolved in the marine environment formed by direct precipitation from supersaturated solution in seawater. However, there is no unequivocal empirical evidence that calcium carbonate or dolomite precipitates directly from modern seawater, and it has been suggested that kinetic inhibitors to carbonate precipitation, related to the low concentration and activity of the carbonate ion, cation hydration and ion complexing, are especially effective in saline waters. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that these inhibitors can be overcome through microbial mediation. Bacteria have been implicated in calcium carbonate precipitation since the Archaean, and though best known in seas and lakes, microbial carbonates are also important in fluviatile, spring, cave, and soil environments. The mechanisms of microbial mineral precipitation appear diverse, but many bacteria exhibit an ability to change solution chemistry and control pH at the microscale, passively or actively, thereby creating the ambient conditions for both oversaturation of Ca2+ and CO32- ions, and removal of kinetic inhibitors. Bacteria dominated the ecosystems of Precambrian shallow marine environments, enhancing their potential involvement in widespread carbonate formation. Chemical precipitation of evaporite minerals is generally accepted, but the involvement of microbes may be significant and underestimated. This review evaluates current knowledge and attempts to define some of the many questions that await resolution.

J	Wu, D; Wang, YF; Fan, C; Xia, BC				Wu, Di; Wang, Yafei; Fan, Chen; Xia, Beicheng			Thermal environment effects and interactions of reservoirs and forests as urban blue-green infrastructures	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Blue-green infrastructures, including reservoirs, lakes, forests and green spaces, play important roles in the microclimate environment. This study investigated the effects of blue-green infrastructures on the surface temperature adjacent to 12 reservoirs in the Pearl River Delta area, China. The temperature of each reservoir and its surrounding environment was retrieved by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) remote sensing imagery. The relationship between the temperature fields around the reservoir and the influencing factors was analyzed with statistical analysis. The results showed that distance (D), underlying surface type, and reservoir capacity (V) had significant effects on the temperature fields around the reservoirs. The temperatures across distances of 0-100 m and 0-200 m away from the reservoir boundary had a linear relationship with distance. The effect of the reservoir on temperature gradually declined when the distance exceeded 200 m. In the 0-300 m range, a quadratic equation with an intercept best fitted the relationship between temperature and distance. Four types of underlying surfaces, including built-up land, bare land, sparse forest land and forest land, were quantified by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Subsequently, a quadratic model expressing the correlation between temperature and the NDVI was obtained. Moreover, the surface temperature at the reservoir edge was negatively correlated to V. Finally, a multiple nonlinear regression equation was found to effectively describe the influence of D, NDVI and V on temperature fields around reservoirs. The influence of reservoir and vegetation (i.e., NDVI) on the field and their contributions were calculated by mathematical methods. The effects of the reservoir and vegetation on the peripheral temperature interacted with each other; the influence of the reservoir and the vegetation on temperature declined and increased, respectively, as distance increased. By addressing the influence of reservoirs and forests on temperature fields and cooling contribution rates, this study provides more insight into the role of blue-green infrastructure in the urban thermal environment.					wu, di/IYS-9217-2023	Wang, yafei/0000-0001-9080-9118; Wang, Yafei/0000-0003-1212-6930													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2018	91						657	663		10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.04.054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.04.054													WOS:000444520600065

The structure has been the subject of a recent ICDP drilling project. In parallel to those efforts, a Russian-German expedition was undertaken in summer 2011 to investigate the permafrost soil, lake terraces, and the volcanic rocks of the southern and eastern crater rim. This provided the unique opportunity for mapping and sampling of the volcanic target rocks around a large part of this complex impact structure. Samples from 43 outcrops were collected and analyzed petrographically and geochemically. The results were combined with earlier mapping outcomes to create a new geological map of this impact structure and its immediate environs, at the scale of 1:50,000. Compositions of our rock suites are compared with the lithologies of the 2009 ICDP drill core. The ignimbrite described as lower bedrock in the ICDP drill core shows petrographically and chemically strong similarities to the rhyolitic and rhyodacitic ignimbrites observed on surface. The suevite sequence exposed in the ICDP drill core is a mixture of all observed target rocks at their respective proportions in the area. In contrast to previous studies, the calculated average target composition of El'gygytgyn takes the contribution of the basic target rocks into consideration: mafic and intermediate rocks approximately 7.5%, and felsic rocks approximately 92.5%.

J	Zan, YL; Gao, YH; Jiang, YS; Pan, YJ; Li, X; Su, PX				Zan, Yulu; Gao, Yanhong; Jiang, Yingsha; Pan, Yongjie; Li, Xia; Su, Peixi			The Effects of Lake Level and Area Changes of Poyang Lake on the Local Weather	ATMOSPHERE												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and is characterized by significant intra-annual variation, with higher water levels and area in the wet season compared to the dry season. However, the effects of the seasonal variation in Poyang Lake on the local weather are still not well-recognized. With the help of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, we designed one control experiment (CTL) using the default Poyang Lake level and area data and two sensitivity experiments, EXPT1 and EXPT2, the former representing the higher lake level and the greater area of Poyang Lake in the wet season and the latter representing the lower lake level and the smaller area of Poyang Lake in the dry season, to assess how these changes affect the local weather. The results of EXPT1 show that, as the lake's level and area increase, the latent heat flux (LH), the sensible heat flux (SH), and the land surface temperature (LST) in the lake area decrease compared to those of the CTL. Meanwhile, the planetary boundary layer height (PBL), the convective available potential energy (CAPE), the wind speed, and the vapor flux over the lake decrease as well, indicating increased atmospheric stratification stability and resulting in a domain-averaged decline in precipitation of -22.3 mm. However, the low lake level and less area in EXPT2 show increasing SH, LST, PBL, and wind speed, and decreasing LH and CAPE compared to those of the CTL. The increasing SH and weakened atmospheric stratification stability in EXPT2 cause a significantly higher wind speed over the eastern part of the lake. As a result, more water vapor is transported to the east side of the lake by westerly upper winds, leading to a decreasing precipitation on the western side of the lake and a slightly increasing precipitation on the eastern side, resulting ultimately in a domain-averaged decline in precipitation of -23.8 mm in the simulation of the low level and less area of Poyang Lake. Although the LH and CAPE decline both in EXPT1 and EXPT2, the main cause is the higher water thermal capacity and lower lake-surface temperature with more lake water for EXPT1 and the lower evaporation with less lake water for EXPT2. Overall, a deeper and larger Poyang Lake will reduce the local temperature, inhibit water evaporation from the lake surface, and make the near-surface atmosphere more stable, resulting in restrained local precipitation. A shrinking lake level and area will raise the local temperature and the instability of the near-surface atmosphere but reduce water vapor and enlarge local wind and circulation, resulting in declining precipitation and a changing fall zone.					; Pan, yongjie/KEJ-4214-2024	Jiang, Yingsha/0000-0002-1567-2374; Pan, Yongjie/0000-0002-5442-2482; gao, yan hong/0000-0002-0403-2929; Su, Peixi/0000-0003-2996-712X														2073-4433				SEP	2022	13	9							1490	10.3390/atmos13091490	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091490													WOS:000858038000001

Comparative proteomics and activity of a green sulfur bacterium through the water column of Lake Cadagno, Switzerland	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>Primary production in the meromictic Lake Cadagno, Switzerland, is dominated by anoxygenic photosynthesis. The green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium clathratiforme is the dominant phototrophic organism in the lake, comprising more than half of the bacterial population, and its biomass increases 3.8-fold over the summer. Cells from four positions in the water column were used for comparative analysis of the Chl. clathratiforme proteome in order to investigate changes in protein composition in response to the chemical and physical gradient in their environment, with special focus on how the bacteria survive in the dark. Although metagenomic data are not available for Lake Cadagno, proteome analysis was possible based on the completely sequenced genome of an isolated strain of Chl. clathratiforme. Using LC-MS/MS we identified 1321 Chl. clathratiforme proteins in Lake Cadagno and quantitatively compared 621 of these in the four samples. Our results showed that compared with cells obtained from the photic zone, cells collected from the dark part of the water column had the same expression level of key enzymes involved in carbon metabolism and photosynthetic light harvesting. However, most proteins participating in nitrogen and sulfur metabolism were twofold less abundant in the dark. From the proteome analysis we were able to show that Chl. clathratiforme in the photic zone contains enzymes for fixation of N-2 and the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate while these processes are probably not active in the dark. Instead we propose that Chl. clathratiforme cells in the dark part of the water column obtain energy for maintenance from the fermentation of polyglucose. Based on the observed protein compositions we have constructed possible pathways for C, N and S metabolism in Chl. clathratiforme.

The round goby throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes is known to cat dressenid mussels (Dreissenidac), but consumption of either dresscnids or native mussels (Unionidae) in tributaries to Lake Erie is minimal based on low populations of any bivalves. The French Creek watershed, on the other hand, harbors 29 species of native freshwater mussels as well as introduced fingernail clams (Sphaeriidae; Corbicula fluminea). The objectives of this study were to document the diet of round gobies in the French Creek watershed to determine whether consumption of native freshwater mussels was occurring. Round gobies were collected in the summer months (May-Sept.) of 2016 via kick seine in four locations, dissected, and their stomach contents identified to lowest possible taxa. We separated the gobies into categories based on length classes, in order to determine if diet changed with increased size and age. Unionid mussels were consumed by all length classes, particularly in length class one (30-44 mm), but diet shifted to a dominance of sphacriids in length class four (>= 75 mm). Round gobies also consumed benthic aquatic insects, a large percentage of which were chironornids (greater than 24% in all size classes). This is the first documentation of unionid consumption by the round goby in Pennsylvania that poses possible threats to native mussels in the French Creek watershed.

Contested views about a gradual or abrupt onset of Saharan aridity at the end of the African Humid Period dominate the current scientific debate about the Holocene Saharan desiccation. In this study, we present a 19.63 m sediment core sequence from Lake Sidi All (Middle Atlas, Morocco) at the North African desert margin. We reconstruct the interaction between Saharan dust supply and Western Mediterranean hydro-climatic variability during the last 12,000 yr based on analyses of lithogenic grain-sizes, XRF geochemistry and stable isotopes of ostracod shells. A robust chronological model based on AMS C-14 dated pollen concentrates supports our multi-proxy study. At orbital-scale there is an overall increase in southern dust supply from the Early Holocene to the Late Holocene, but our Northern Saharan dust record indicates that a gradual Saharan desiccation was interrupted by multiple abrupt dust increases before the 'southern dust mode' was finally established at 4.7 cal ka BP. The Sidi Ali record features millennial peaks in Saharan dust increase at about 11.1, 10.2, 9.4, 8.2, 7.3, 6.6, 6.0, and 5.0 cal ka BP. Early Holocene Saharan dust peaks coincide with Western Mediterranean winter rain minima and North Atlantic cooling events. In contrast, Late Holocene dust peaks correspond mostly with prevailing positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. By comparing with other North African records, we suggest that increases in Northern Saharan dust supply do not solely indicate sub-regional to regional aridity in Mediterranean Northwest Africa but might reflect aridity at a trans-Saharan scale. In particular, our findings support major bimillennial phases of trans-Saharan aridity at 10.2, 8.2, 6.0 and 4.2 cal ka BP. These phases coincide with North Atlantic cooling and a weak African monsoon. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The nalkanes in the terrestrial plants exhibited a modal distribution, maximizing at n-C-25 or n-C-27 with average chain length (ACL) values ranging from 26.6 to 27.7. The ACL values of the sediments were similar to those of terrestrial herbaceous plants from the study area. The average n-alkane delta D value (-81.7%0) for the woody-plant leaves was higher than that for terrestrial herbaceous plants (-164.3%0). The average delta D values of n-alkanes in the sediments ranged from -163.8%0 to -127.7%0, which fall between the delta D values in herbaceous and woody plants, but closer to those in terrestrial herbaceous plants from the study area. This similarity of the n-alkane distributions, and delta D values of sediments and plants suggests that n-alkanes in the sediments are likely to be derived mainly from terrestrial herbaceous and partly from woody plants.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					2014	48	3					321	329		10.2343/geochemj.2.0308	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.2.0308													WOS:000337200200008

BC for the southwestern Balkans	DENDROCHRONOLOGIA												The archaeological site of Sovjan is situated on the edge of the Korce Basin, southeastern Albania. Its remarkably long and well investigated stratigraphic sequence, spanning from the Neolithic till the Iron Age, makes it an important type- and reference-site for the whole region. At different periods of prehistory it was located on the shores of the former Lake Maliq that once filled the Korce Basin, but was definitely drained in the 1940's. These permanent wetland conditions on the site allowed for a high degree of preservation of organic material, especially wood. Based on the current knowledge, level 8 of Sovjan contains the best-preserved wooden material of all the Early Bronze Age sites in the Balkans. Through the combination of dendrochronology and Bayesian modelling, i.e. wiggle-matching, a floating 269-years long tree-ring chronology was constructed, with an absolute end-date range falling between 2158 and 2142 cal BC (2s). It was possible to establish that the dwellings and the trackway associated with the last occupation phase of level 8 are contemporaneous. Additionally, with the help of the new dendrochronological data and based on previously published charcoal dates, the absolute chronology of the subsequent level 7 is being narrowed-down to a range from the mid-22nd to mid-20th c. cal BC (2s). The Early Bronze Age layers of the archaeological site of Sovjan, which are particularly pertinent for the 3rd millennium chronology of the southwestern Balkans, can now be dated with high precision for the first time and hence offer a major chronological reference point in the region.					; Gori, Maja/AAV-5180-2021; Szidat, Sönke/D-6706-2011; Hafner, Albert/ABH-4856-2020	Bolliger, Matthias/0000-0003-1937-6633; Hafner, Albert/0000-0003-2159-8569; Ballmer, Ariane/0000-0001-8210-7837; Maczkowski, Andrej/0000-0003-3081-3769; Gori, Maja/0000-0002-8106-4801; 													1125-7865	1612-0051				APR	2021	66								125811	10.1016/j.dendro.2021.125811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2021.125811		JAN 2021											WOS:000632597700003

These lakes were located at latitudes between 35 and 43 degrees N with altitudes from 5 to 2700 m in Japanese islands and differed largely with respect to trophic conditions, basin morphometries, and land use and land cover in the watersheds. Among the lakes, pCO(2) in the surface water varied more than three orders of magnitude (1.4-4749.7 Pa) and was higher than that at atmospheric levels in 73% of the lakes, suggesting that the majority of the lakes were net heterotrophic. Among the within-lake variables, biomass of both zooplankton and phytoplankton as well as the sediment area of mixed layer were important predictors of pCO(2) at the surface. Thus, lake CO2 concentrations are regulated by the balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic activities, and sediment respiration is a crucial source of CO2 supersaturation, especially in shallow isothermal lakes. The best model for pCO(2) at the lake surface water included relative size of deciduous forests, grasslands, and urban areas in the watershed. The balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic activities in lakes depends highly on land use and cover in the watershed. Changes in terrestrial vegetation can affect carbon metabolism, even if local anthropogenic activities in the watersheds are unchanged.

Variability in the Index of Light Absorption by a Yellow Substance in the Surface Layer of Lake Teletskoye	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												Experimental data obtained in summer 2017 in the course of field hydrophysical studies on the variation in the index of light absorption by a yellow substance in the surface layer of Lake Teletskoye (Altai Mountains) are presented. The calculated values of the index of light absorption by a yellow substance (in natural logarithms) in the spectrum range 400-800 nm during the period under study were within 0.1-2.1 m(-1). The yellow substance concentration in Lake Teletskoye, found according to the optical method by the measured index of light absorption by the yellow substance, varied within 2.9-5.1 g/m(3). To estimate the effect of light absorption by the yellow substance on the total attenuation, the relative spectral contribution of main optically active lake water components (yellow substance, suspended matter, chlorophyll, and clean water) to the spectral absorption index over the water body under study has been calculated. It has been revealed that the yellow substance makes the maximum contribution at all points (in total, 21 sampling points) of the lake.

The functionality of these lakes is: the flood regularisation and for recreation. Over time were deposited on the bottom of lakes a large amounts of the alluvial deposits (sediments) carried by the waters of the river and its tributaries, and rainfall run-off out of the vicinity. A first consequence of the alluvial deposits consist in lowering the initial depth of the lakes, which facilitated excessive growth of the aquatic vegetation, and, in summer, the effects that affect the ichthyofauna and the recreation activities. Another consequence of the alluvium deposits located immediately upstream of discharge points is the diminuation of the transport capacity of the Colentina river. This paper presents a synthesis that brings together both specific elements: the conceptual model of the lakes and a series of the analytical results obtained from implementing an experimental field: 11 sampling points in order to investigate water quality, respectively the monitoring and control.

The Kilimanjaro Score for assessing fitness to fly paragliders at high altitude. High Alt. Med. Biol. 14:304-307.Extreme sports such as paragliding are increasing in popularity, providing continued challenges for the development of safe practice techniques. In January and February 2013, the Wings of Kilimanjaro expedition aimed to launch 95 paragliders from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, 5790m above sea level. A safe launch was paramount but risked being impaired by adverse environmental conditions, in particular the pathophysiological effects of high altitude. There are no existing scores to assess fitness for high-altitude paraglider launches present in the literature. A novel scoring system, the Kilimanjaro Score, was therefore developed to rapidly assess pilots pre-flight. The Kilimanjaro Score aimed to assess cognition, memory, and visual-spatial skill within the context of standard pre-flight checks. Further testing, including the Lake Louise Score, was to be performed if the pilot's Kilimanjaro Score was deemed unsatisfactory. We present the Kilimanjaro Score here for comment and refinement, and we invite other parties to consider its use in the field for high altitude paragliding activities.

It hosts numerous lakes as well as the head waters of major Asian rivers, on which billions of people depend, and it is particularly sensitive to climate change. The moisture transport to the TP is controlled by the Indian and Pacific monsoon and the Westerlies. Understanding the evolution of the interaction of these circulation systems requires studies on climate archives in different spatial and temporal contexts. The objective of this study is to learn more about the interannual variability of precipitation patterns across the TP and how different hydrologic systems react to different climatic factors. Aragonite shells of the aquatic gastropod Radix, which is widely distributed in the region, may represent suitable archives for inferring hydrologic and climatic signals in particularly high resolution. Therefore, sclerochronological studies of delta O-18 and delta C-13 ratios in Radix shells from seven lakes were conducted, each representing a different hydrologic and climatic setting, on a transect from the Pamirs across the TP. The shell patterns exhibit an increasing influence of precipitation and a decreasing influence of evaporation on the isotope compositions from west to east. delta O-18 values of shells from lakes on the eastern and central TP (Donggi Cona, Yamdrok Yumco, Tarab Co) mirror monsoon signals, indicated by more negative values and higher variabilities compared to the more western lakes (Karakul, Bangong/Nyak, Manasarovar). In Yadang Co, located on the central southern TP, the monsoon rains did not reach the lake in the sampling year, although it is located in a region which is usually affected by monsoon circulation. The delta O-18 values are used to differentiate the annual hydrological cycle into ice cover period, melt water period, precipitation period and evaporation period. delta C-13 compositions in the shells particularly depend on specific habitats, which vary in biological productivity and in carbon sources. delta O-18 and delta C-13 patterns show a positive covariance in shells originating from large closed basins. The results show that Radix shells mirror general climatic differences between the seven lake regions. These differences reflect both regional and local climate signals in sub-seasonal resolution, without noticeable dependence on the particular lake system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Firth, C; Cronin, S				Firth, Chris; Cronin, Shane			Life-cycles of a lava lake: Ambrym volcano, Vanuatu	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Eighteen years of heat flux data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to investigate cycles of lava lake activity at Ambrym volcano in Vanuatu. Lava lakes are dynamic mani-festations of open-vent volcanic behaviour and time-series analysis of this behaviour reveals the timing and magnitude of magmatic processes. Pulsatory fluctuations in heat flux of > 50 MW over periods of 30 to >100 days during lava lake activity are interpreted to represent episodes of magma replenishment. These are peri-odically interrupted by rapid falls in heat flux (50-100 MW over <5 days) or variations in the relative heat flux from lava lakes in different vents of the volcano, which are interpreted to represent changes to the shallow plumbing system feeding lava lake activity. Sudden lava lake drainage and flank eruptions can interrupt or terminate lava lake cycles. Heat flux patterns preceding such events do not show an obvious consistent pattern, suggesting that different magmatic processes may initiate these potentially hazardous surges in eruption in-tensity. Comparison with the dynamics of other lava lakes reveals similarities in long-term behaviour, despite differences in lava lake size, surface motion or degassing. Collectively this suggests fundamental similarities in the processes that sustain open-vent behaviour, including, the stability of magma supply, conduit-plumbing/ geometry and local strain-state.

Reconstructing past fire temperatures from ancient charcoal material	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Charcoal abundance measurements are commonly used to estimate fire activity in palaeoecological studies; however, fire temperature is not directly measured. Reconstructing fire temperature is desirable because the ecological response to fire is, in part, a function of the temperature of the fire, e.g. crown fires > 500 degrees C, slash and burn agriculture < 400 degrees C. Here, we determine whether charcoal chemistry, as inferred from Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), is a reliable proxy for fire (combustion) temperature. We generated reference charcoal material from a grass species (Panicum capillare) and a woody species (Alnus glutinosa), prepared with three different laboratory treatments (untreated, water, and hydrogen peroxide), and heated to six temperatures (200-700 degrees C). We picked individual charcoal fragments from lake sediments deposited between ca. 1400 and 450 years ago to compare with the reference charcoal material. FTIR spectra were used to infer the chemical composition of both modern reference and ancient charcoal. The FTIR spectra of the datasets were analysed with model-based clustering. The inferred chemistry of the reference charcoal from the FTIR spectra was in broad agreement with previous studies, and the model-based clustering algorithms were able to distinguish clusters based on the temperature to which the material was heated. The FTIR spectra from the ancient charcoal fragments fell within the range of variability of the modern reference charcoal, allowing for successful classification of the fragments created by fires in the long distant past. We used a probability density function of each statistically significant cluster to infer combustion temperatures for the ancient charcoal fragments. Our results suggest that the use of FTIR analysis of charcoal can differentiate low (200 degrees C-300 degrees C), medium (400 degrees C-600 degrees C) and high (600 degrees C-700 degrees C) temperature fires. Our findings pave the way for generating a better understanding of the role of fire in Earth's system through time.					; Gosling, William/D-2459-2009	McMichael, Crystal/0000-0002-1064-1499; Gosling, William/0000-0001-9903-8401													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 15	2019	520						128	137		10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.01.029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.01.029													WOS:000463125100010

Zooplankton as sources and sinks in the pelagic phosphorus cycle of a mesotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The impact of various zooplankton groups on the cycling and retention of phosphorus in a mesotrophic lake in late summer was estimated in a 10-d mesocosm experiment with addition of P-33. Specific assimilation rates for various dissolved and particulate fractions and individual zooplankton species were estimated by application of tracer models. By means of mathematical inverse methods, these estimates were used to construct a balanced P budget that included the different zooplankton groups. Altogether, the consumers (including the mixotrophic Dinobryon) were responsible for >60% of the estimated P sedimentation (similar to 1% d(-1)). The microconsumers had the largest specific P assimilation (0.28 d(-1)) and regenerated 45% of assimilated P; Daphnia had an intermediate P assimilation (0.17 d(-1)), but regenerated <20%, whereas Cyclops assimilated P quite slowly (0.07 d(-1)) and regenerated 230% of its assimilation of algal P <20 mu m, due to its feeding on microconsumers. The microconsumers, and the daphnids in particular, thus act mainly as sinks for P, whereas the cyclopoids act mainly as sources of P by assimilating and regenerating P otherwise trapped in the microconsumers. The mechanisms responsible for these different roles seem related to growth rate and P content of the consumers relative to that of their diet.

In this piece of creative non-fiction, I explore my encounter with Malcolm Lowry through his archive at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver: specifically, through a set of love-notes written to his wife, Margerie Bonner, and through his 'Last Notebook', a tiny notebook kept during the Lowrys' trip to Northumberland and the Lake District in summer 1957, just weeks before Lowry's death. I reflect on the sense of connection across time created by this encounter with a writer's archive, and connect this to the way that Lowry himself explores the same sense of connection in his short story 'Strange Comfort Afforded by the Profession'. I consider what type of text a writer's notebook might be, particularly whether or not we might agree with Kirsty Gunn's claim that a writer's notebook is the 'most private' type of writing, and I reflect on what my own responses to Lowry's notes to Margerie and 'Last Notebook' might tell us about our relationship, as readers, to those writers who matter the most to us.

The paper also shows that not knowing the effects of series compensation on voltages can lead to operational problems. This paper has demonstrated that series compensation can lead to either low or high voltages depending on the line loading condition as well as on how the voltage control is set. If the voltage is inadequately controlled on the one end of the capacitor, then the other side of the capacitor might lead to voltage problems. The sensitivity study is based on a full approved WECC base case and it is performed using GE PSLF program. A 500kV transmission line from Midpoint substation (Idaho Power Company) to Summer Lake substation (BPA) is taken as an example and monitored in this study.

The enzyme systems that repair UV-induced DNA damage are temperature dependent, and thus potentially less effective at repairing DNA damage at lower temperatures. This hypothesis was tested by examining the levels of UV-induced DNA damage in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulicaria in the presence and absence of longer-wavelength photoreactivating radiation (PRR) that induces photoenzymatic repair (PER) of DNA damage. By exposing both live and dead (freeze-killed) Daphnia as well as raw DNA to UV-B in the presence and absence of PRR, we were able to estimate the relative importance and temperature dependence of PER (light repair), nucleotide excision repair (NER, dark repair), and photoprotection (PP). Total DNA damage increased with increasing temperature. However, the even greater increase in DNA repair rates at higher temperatures led net DNA damage (total DNA damage minus repair) to be greater at lower temperatures. Photoprotection accounted for a much greater proportion of the reduction in DNA damage than did repair. Experiments that looked at survival rates following UV exposure demonstrated that PER increased survival rates. The important implication is that aquatic organisms that depend heavily on DNA repair processes may be less able to survive high UV exposure in low temperature environments. Photoprotection may be more effective under the low temperature, high UV conditions such as are found in early spring or at high elevations.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				APR	2004	10	4					408	416		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2003.00750.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2003.00750.x													WOS:000220548800002

In 1990, the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory initiated a 7-year survey program to monitor changes in the lower food web of Saginaw Bay, where zebra mussels became established in the fall of 1991. To investigate shifts in the phytoplankton community composition over the 7-year period from 1990 to 1996 we searched for clusters of similar composition using multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) on proportions of 22 taxonomic groupings of the total phytoplankton density (cells per milliliter). We then used an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of the PCA scores. We identified five characteristic phytoplankton communities in configurations that allowed recognizing four distinct periods in Saginaw Bay linked to the zebra mussel invasion. Significant changes were indicative of increased water clarity and eutrophic conditions being replaced by more oligotrophic conditions as clusters dominated by light sensitive species, such as the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria redekii, became immediately rare and clusters dominated by diatoms such as Cyclotella spp. became common. Microcystis spp., a light tolerant cyanobacteria not grazed by zebra mussel, dominated assemblages after 1994. The shifts in phytoplankton composition confirm that zebra mussels effects on phytoplankton communities are mediated by both direct (filtration) and indirect (nutrient cycling) mechanisms and also suggests that increased light penetration is an important mechanism behind some changes.

The lake acidified during the 1960's and pH was mostly below 5 throughout the 1970's. Due to the acidification, peat moss (Sphagnum spp.) expanded over the lake bottom and the only surviving fish species was perch (Perca fluviatilis), but it experienced reproduction problems. In the mid 1980's, the Sphagnum cover collapsed, and by 1989 it had almost disappeared. There has been a clear recovery of the perch population. Recovery of the lake is also recorded by diatom assemblages in the lake sediment. Diatom-inferred pH increased from 4.7 to 4.9. The development of measured lake-water pH is unclear, but acid episodes in spring have become less severe. By 1993, atmospheric sulphate deposition had decreased by 30-40% in this area of Sweden compared to the late 1960's. Lake-water sulphate concentrations have decreased by similar to 30% since the 1960's. Nitrogen deposition has increased over the last decades, but is not yet contributing to lake acidification. No major land-use changes have occurred and changes in hydrology cannot explain the observed changes in chemistry and biology. We ascribe the recent recovery in the lake to reduced deposition of sulphate. In conclusion, Lake Orvattnet has begun to recover from acidification.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	3					1795	1800		10.1007/BF00477240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00477240													WOS:A1995UD33500123

In this study, sediment cores from four lakes in Cajas National Park, southern Ecuador, situated approximately 200 km downwind of active volcanoes in the Northern Andes Volcanic Zone, were analysed to document the regional history of tephra fall extending back around 3,000 a cal BP. The ages of the lacustrine sedimentary sequences were constrained using a total of 20 AMS radiocarbon ages on plant remains. The tephra layers were correlated among the lakes based on their radiocarbon age, elemental composition, colour, and grain morphology. We found five unique tephra layers, each at least 0.2 cm thick, and further constrained their ages by combining the results from two age-depth modelling approaches (clam and rbacon). The tephra layers were deposited 3,034 +/- 621, 2,027 +/- 41, 1,557 +/- 177, 733 +/- 112, and 450 +/- 70 a cal BP. The ages of all but the youngest tephra layer overlap with those of known eruptions from Tungurahua. Some tephra layers are missing as macroscopic layers in several cores, with only two of the five tephra layers visible in the sediment of three lakes. Likewise, previous studies of lake sediment cores from the region are missing the four youngest tephra layers, further highlighting the need to sample multiple lakes to reconstruct a comprehensive history of fallout events. The newly documented stratigraphic marker layers will benefit future studies of lake sediments in Cajas National Park.

J	Wager, DJ; Baker, FA				Wager, DJ; Baker, FA			Potential effects of ozone, climate, and spruce budworm on Douglas-fir growth in the Wasatch Mountains	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												This study assessed the potential for ozone injury to vegetation in the central Wasatch Mountains of Utah by determining if Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) experienced reduced growth since the onset of high ozone concentrations. Dendrochronological techniques were used to model Douglas-fir growth in six central Wasatch Mountain stands, where ozone concentrations suggest the possibility of injury to vegetation, and in four Bear River stands, where ozone concentrations are lower than injury thresholds. Previous-year growth, temperature, and Palmer's Z index variables explained 53-70% of the variance in annual growth. Reduced Douglas-fir growth, not explained by the model or insect and disease records, occurred after 1970 in the central Wasatch Mountains but not in the Bear River Mountains. Douglas-fir growth in the central Wasatch Mountains was slightly negatively correlated with the previous-year ozone concentrations in nearby Salt Lake valley. Between 1962 and 1973, a fluctuating budworm population due to varying spring precipitation was suggested to have replaced precipitation as the factor limiting tree growth, causing an anomalous negative relationship between precipitation and Douglas-fir growth. Because of a suite of possible factors (e.g., undetected climatic variables, fungal pathogens, competitive interactions) influencing Douglas-fir growth, ozone may be one factor in a larger stressor complex reducing growth.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				MAY	2003	33	5					910	921		10.1139/X02-211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X02-211													WOS:000182987200017
J	ARANDAGOMEZ, JJ; LUHR, JF; PIER, JG				ARANDAGOMEZ, JJ; LUHR, JF; PIER, JG			THE LA-BRENA-EL-JAGUEY-MAAR COMPLEX, DURANGO, MEXICO .1. GEOLOGICAL EVOLUTION	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The La Brena - El Jaguey Maar Complex, of probable Holocene age, is one of the youngest eruptive centers in the Durango Volcanic Field (DVF), a Quaternary lava plain that covers 2100 km2 and includes about 100 cinder and lava cones. The volcanic complex consists of two intersecting maars - La Brena and El Jaguey - at least two pre-maar scoria cones and associated lavas, and a series of nested post-maar lava and scoria cones that erupted within La Brena Maar and flooded its floor with lava to form one or more lava lakes. We believe that El Jaguey Maar formed first, but pyroclastic deposits associated with its formation are exposed at only a few places in the lower maar walls. A perennial lake in the bottom of El Jaguey marks the top of an aquifer about 60 m below the lava plain. Interaction of the rising basanitic magmas with this aquifer was probably responsible for the hydromagmatic eruptions at the maar complex. In the southeastern quadrant of La Brena and in most parts of El Jaguey, the upper maar walls expose a thick pyroclastic sequence of tuffs, tuff breccias, and breccias that is dominated by thinly layered sandwave and plane-parallel surge beds and contains minor interlayered scoria-fall horizons. We conclude that these deposits in the upper walls of both maars erupted during the formation of La Brena, based on: (1) thickness variations in a prominent scoria-fall marker bed interlayered with the surge deposits; (2) inferred transport directions for ballistic clasts, channels, and dune-like bedforms; and (3) lateral facies changes in the surge deposits. Some of the surge clouds from La Brena apparently travelled down the inner southwestern wall of El Jaguey, fanned out across its floor, and climbed up the opposite walls before emerging onto the surrounding lava plain. These clouds deposited steep, inward-dipping surge deposits along the lower walls of El Jaguey. Following this hydromagmatic phase, which was responsible for the formation of the maars, a series of strombolian eruptions took place from vents within La Brena. At many places along the maar rims these eruptions completely buried the surge beds under a thick sequence of post-maar scoriae and ashes. The outer flanks of the maar complex and the surrounding lava plain are also blanketed by post-maar ashes. The final phase of activity involved effusive eruptions of post-maar lavas from vents on the floor of La Brena. The evolutionary sequence from hydromagmatic eruptions during formation of the maars, through strombolian eruptions of the post-maar scoriae and ashes, and finally to the post-maar lavas appears to reflect the declining influence of magma-groundwater interactions with time. Basanitic magmas from all eruptive stages carried spinel-lherzolite and feldspathic-granulite xenoliths to the surface. The La Brena - El Jaguey Maar Complex contains the only known hydromagmatic vents in the DVF and the largest spinel-lherzolite xenoliths, which range up to 30 cm diameter. These two observations indicate an unusually rapid ascent rate for these basanitic magmas compared to those from other DVF vents.

Modeling Groundwater Inflow to the New Crater Lake at Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i	GROUNDWATER												During the 2018 eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i, scientists relied heavily on a conceptual model of explosive eruptions triggered when lava-lake levels drop below the water table. Numerical modeling of multiphase groundwater flow and heat transport revealed that, contrary to expectations, liquid water inflow to the drained magma conduit would likely be delayed by months to years, owing to the inability of liquid water to transit a zone of very hot rock. The summit of Kilauea subsequently experienced an similar to 2-month period of consistent repeated collapses, and the crater now extends below the equilibrium position of the water table. Liquid water first emerged into the deepened crater in late July 2019. The timing of first appearance of liquid water (about 14 months postcollapse) and the rate of crater lake filling (currently similar to 27 kg/s) were well-predicted by the numerical modeling done in late spring 2018, which forecast liquid inflow after 3 to 24 months at rates of 10 to 100 kg/s. A second-generation groundwater model, reflecting the current crater geometry, forecasts lake filling over the next several years. The successful 2018 to present forecasts with both models are based on unadjusted in situ permeability estimates (1 to 6 x 10(-14) m(2)) and water-table elevations (600 to 800 m) from a nearby research drillhole and geophysical surveys. Important unknowns that affect the reliability of longer-term forecasts include the equilibrium water-table geometry, the rate of evaporation from the hot and growing crater lake (currently similar to 29,000 m(2)at 70-80 degrees C), and heterogenous permeability changes caused by the 2018 collapse.																			0017-467X	1745-6584				JAN	2021	59	1					7	15		10.1111/gwat.13023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13023		JUN 2020						32511748					WOS:000543718000001

In order to enhance the water level (by increasing depth) and water quality (by reducing internal nutrient loading), the sediment of this lagoon was partially removed in 1993 (August to October). Afterwards, this lagoon was monitored during 13 months for water temperature, conductivity, oxygen, pH, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium, phosphorus, depth and transparency, phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a) and zooplankton, in two zones: the dredged (DZ) and the non-dredged (NDZ). Sediment removal induced resuspension of fine particles, giving rise to a decrease in transparency and an increase in the amount of inorganic nutrients. Thereafter, DZ showed lower nutrient concentrations than NDZ, mainly regarding to phosphorus and nitrogen. Chlorophyll-a concentration was significantly lower in DZ (annual mean = 0.33 mg/m(3)) than in NDZ (annual mean = 2.31 mg/m(3)). In November (1993), zooplankton populations (rotifers, copepods and cladocerans) were already inhabiting the DZ. Ceriodaphnia pulchella SARS collected in previous studies was not recorded; otherwise, additional species were recorded (Ceriodaphnia reticulata JURINE, Simocephalus vetulus O. F. MULLER and Moina rectirostris LEYDIG). Macrophyte vegetation did not develop in the DZ during the studied period.					Goncalves, Fernando J.

Approximately 100 organic compounds in the samples were detected with an average of 61 perpendicular to 36 ng m(-3) in total, accounting for 2.6 +/- 1.0% of OC. n-Alkanes (19 +/- 12 ng m(-3)), fatty alcohols (12 +/- 7.6 ng m(-3)), polyols and polyacids (7.5 +/- 3.6 ng m(-3)), sugars (6.5 +/- 4.8 ng m(-3)), and biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOA) (6.3 +/- 4.4 ng m(-3)) are the major compounds in the samples, while phthalates (1.9 +/- 1.2 ng m(-3)), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (0.7 perpendicular to 0.5 ng m(-3)) and phthalic acids (2.6 perpendicular to 1.5 ng m(-3)) are minor and one to three orders of magnitude lower than those in urban and rural regions over China. Our results showed that 2-methyltetrols in the PM2.5 samples, two key tracers for isoprene photo-oxidation, positively correlated with ambient temperature, which can be explained by enhancements in biogenic emission and photochemical oxidation when temperature increases. However, we also found that 2-methyltetrols in the samples negatively correlated with relative humidity (RH). Aerosol inorganic model (AIM) calculation showed that in situ acidity of the fine particles decreased along with an increase of RH, which results in a decrease in BSOA production due to acid-catalysed particle-phase reactions inefficient under higher RH conditions.

In Minnesota, these problematic invasive species are primarily managed to maintain open water and to prevent spread in and among lakes. The principal management tools utilized in the state are selective herbicide treatments or mechanical cutting of the invasive plant. In spring 2018, a new selective auxin-mimic herbicide, florpyrauxifen-benzyl, was trialed and evaluated for efficacy in controlling HWM. This management effort represented the first time florpyrauxifen-benzyl was utilized in a public waterbody in Minnesota. Changes were examined in invasive and native plant frequency from June to 1 yr after treatment in two 4.9-ha study plots treated at 5.79 mu g L-1. Aquatic vegetation surveys were conducted pre- and posttreatment to assess the efficacy of the herbicide treatment in a localized area of dense HWM growth. Changes in native aquatic plant species presence were measured and overall showed few to no declines, whereas HWM decreased from 72 to 1% and 58 to 8% after treatment and remained low 1 yr after treatment. In both instances, florpyrauxifen-benzyl adequately controlled HWM and is an effective partial-lake treatment tool that should be considered for invasive milfoil management.																			0146-6623					JAN	2022	60						16	22																WOS:000894490700003
J	Gough, WA				Gough, W. A.			Theoretical considerations of day-to-day temperature variability applied to Toronto and Calgary, Canada data	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Day-to-day temperature variability has been examined within the context of three theoretical climates: orderly, random and oscillatory. Using highly idealized examples two measures of day-to-day variability were compared. It was found that standard deviation works well to characterize variability for random climates, as expected, but did not perform well for orderly and oscillatory climates. For these climates, a more direct calculation of day-to-day variability was found to be more representative. This method better captures the clustering of temperatures that may result from a number of meteorological and geographic factors which bring order to the local climate. These concepts were applied to two Canadian cities, Toronto, Ontario and Calgary, Alberta. Both cities were found to have a degree of orderliness in their climate. Toronto's orderliness appears to be linked to the temperature mitigating effect of a moister climate and midlatitude cyclones. In addition, the proximity of Lake Ontario produces land/sea breezes which act to reduce thermal variability. Calgary experienced more variability, both on average and in the exceedances of 5 degrees C and 10 degrees C thresholds for day-to-day temperature swings. This is a result of a drier climate with less hydro-climatic inertia and the presence of chinook winds which produce, particularly in winter, swings of temperature frequently exceeding 10 degrees C. Although all the measures of day-to-day temperature variability examined appear to be decreasing in both cities, only the decrease of 5 degrees C exceedances of T(min) at Toronto was statistically significant.

Application of the NCAR FastEddy® Microscale Model to a Lake Breeze Front	ATMOSPHERE												This study investigates how urban environments influence boundary layer processes during the passage of a Great Salt Lake breeze using a multi-scale modeling system, NCAR's WRF-Coupled GPU-accelerated FastEddy (R) (FE) model. Motivated by the need for sub-10 m scale decision support tools for uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), the FE model was used to simulate turbulent flows around urban structures at 5 m horizontal resolution with a 9 km x 9 km domain centered on the Salt Lake City International Airport. FE was one-way nested within a 1 km resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) domain spanning 400 x 400 km. Focused on the late morning lake breeze on 3 June 2022, an FE simulation was compared with WRF outputs and validated using surface and radar observations. The FE simulation revealed low sensible heat flux and cool near-surface temperatures, attributed to a relatively low specification of thermal roughness suitable for previously tested FE applications. Lake breeze characteristics were minimally affected, as FE effectively resolved interactions between the lake breeze and urban-induced turbulent eddies, providing insights into fine-scale boundary layer processes. FE's GPU acceleration ensured efficient simulations, underscoring its potential for aiding decision support in UAS operations in complex urban environments.

This paper investigates the tufa deposits of Sparkling Lake in the Jiuzhaigou gully of the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP). Detailed analysis of mineral composition, major elements and stable isotope (delta C-13, delta O-18) distinguished seven "dirty tufa layers" that are characterized by quartz-rich sediments, high kaolinite and high K, Na and Al. Compared with clean tufa deposits, dirty components in the tufa deposits were a result of surface soil erosion activity during strong monsoon rainfall periods within the catchment. The chronology of tufa deposits is established by using radiocarbon (C-14) dating of organic material from the dirty tufa layers. Seven flood-rich periods and eight flood-poor periods during the early and mid-Holocene were recorded by the dirty tufa layers interbedded with clean tufa layers in the Jiuzhaigou gully. The tufa records are more sensitive response to regional hydroclimate change, in comparison with the peat, lake sediments and stalagmite records. The low values of delta O-1(8) and delta C-13 in the dirty tufa layers indicate the flood-rich periods (10310-8390, 7120, 6910, 6340, 5900, 5620, 5020 a BP) were mainly triggered by strong monsoon rainfall events during early and mid-Holocene. Considering the chronological uncertainties and sampling resolution, some other abrupt climate events (i.e, 8200 a BP and 5500 a BP) may be also recorded in the tufa deposits. These results greatly improve our understanding of hydroclimate change in the ETP during the early and mid-Holocene.					; Liu, Tao/AAO-8419-2021	zhou, Liang/0000-0003-2413-9413; Cui, Peng/0000-0002-3973-5966; Liu, Tao/0000-0002-7394-9415; chen, xiao qing/0000-0002-0177-0811													0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2021	196								104834	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104834													WOS:000583955200022
J	Ryabtsev, VV; Katzner, TE				Ryabtsev, Vitaliy V.; Katzner, Todd E.			Severe declines of Eastern Imperial Eagle Aquila heliaca populations in the Baikal region, Russia:: a modern and historical perspective	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												The Eastern Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca), a vulnerable and declining species, is widely but sparsely distributed throughout its range. Because much of that range extends through the Russian-speaking world, relatively little on the species has been published in English. The world's easternmost population of Eastern Imperial Eagles, at Lake Baikal, Russia, is particularly well studied and, because of recent rapid population declines, is of great conservation concern. Here, using a data set covering more than 20 years evaluated in the context of historical accounts published in Russian, we assess recent severe declines in this population and the subsequent changes in its conservation status. In intensively surveyed areas near Lake Baikal, numbers of territories occupied by eagles have declined by 80-100% in the past 20-40 years. Likewise, throughout the entire region, the average number of known occupied and breeding territories were both more than 40% lower in 1998-1999 than they were in 1982-1983. These data suggest severe long-term declines in the population of Baikal's Imperial Eagles. Because we observed only limited decreases in reproductive output, our interpretation of the patterns in these data is that mortality of non-breeding birds (wintering adults and all pre-adults) is the most likely cause for this decline. Addressing the causes of this decline is critical to protect this severely threatened population from extirpation.

The Carlson Integrated Trophic State Index method was applied to evaluate water quality and eutrophication in the reservoir, considering both exogenous inputs and internal water quality conditions. Additionally, by investigating water quality and biological factors (zooplankton and fish) in the reservoir, this study identified the main drivers influencing phytoplankton outbreaks in Dawangtan Reservoir through redundancy analysis (RDA) and Pearson correlation analysis. The results showed that the combined trophic state index of the reservoir varied between 29.2 and 56.5 throughout the year, with each water quality indicator performing worse during the summer months when temperatures were higher. There was a positive correlation between zooplankton biomass and phytoplankton biomass, and the increase in the proportion of phytophagous fish contributed to the reduction in phytoplankton. The redundancy analysis revealed that the distribution of phytoplankton species was significantly correlated with total phosphorus (TP), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a), with different phytoplankton species responding variably to these environmental factors. Finally, a multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to construct the optimal response equation between Chl-a concentration and environmental factors. The results indicated that pH, Secchi disk (SD), DO, and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were the main factors affecting Chl-a concentration. Therefore, the outcomes of abiotic environmental factors and lake biological resources should be considered in the restoration of eutrophic lakes to achieve the desired restoration effect.					赵, 国丽/HZJ-9699-2023; Huang, Xianyu/N-9729-2019; huang, xusheng/GRY-3513-2022															2073-4441				JUN	2024	16	12							1752	10.3390/w16121752	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16121752													WOS:001256072400001

The experiments were performed in situ in summer 1999 in the western basin with generally higher primary production rates and light attenuation coefficient due to higher algal biomass and in the eastern basin of the lake. Primary production was measured using C-14-technique, samples collected on-site were incubated at different depths for 4 h centred around noon. Underwater photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700) was measured prior to incubation. The incubation was carried out in three treatments using cut-off filters to exclude various portions of the UVR spectrum. Surface photoinhibition reached 72-78% in the samples exposed to PAR and UVR as compared to the control treatment from which UVR was excluded, however, areal primary production showed only an 8-14% decrease in the presence of UVR. Although the filters applied absorb ca. 15% PAR as well, comparison of the treatments pointed out that it was UVAR (320-400 nm), and not UVBR (280-320 nm) that predominantly inhibited photosynthesis.

J	Evans, JE				Evans, JE			Recognition and implications of Eocene tufas and travertines in the Chadron Formation, White River Group, Badlands of South Dakota	SEDIMENTOLOGY												There are few descriptions of pre-quaternary tufa or travertine, yet these deposits have important climatic, hydrological and tectonic implications. In the Badlands of South Dakota, the Late Eocene Chadron Formation contains a variety of tufa (fluvial, lacustrine, paludal and perched springline types), travertine and calcrete (pedogenic and non-pedogenic types). In fluvial channels, tufas and tufa barrages (oncolites, tufa lithoclast conglomerates and phytoherms) are transitional to travertines (pseudostromatolitic boundstone gravels and small pinnacle resurgences with rimstone edges and pools). Lacustrine tufas formed in small ponds adjacent to other types of tufas and are similar to the 'low-energy, bench-margin facies' types observed in modern, groundwater-fed, temperate-zone hardwater lakes. Paludal tufas are laterally discontinuous sheets of pisoid-intraclast wackestone that fill palaeotopography. Distal perched springline tufas are mounds of numerous sloping tufa sheets. Concretions and rhizoliths associated with palaeosols are recognized as pedogenic calcretes, whereas non-pedogenic calcretes are variably cemented, vertically oriented conduits for palaeogroundwater discharge that are located in fault zones. These deposits resulted from palaeogroundwater discharge along faults during the Late Eocene. Coeval unroofing of the Black Hills uplift created a regional groundwater flow system through karsted Palaeozoic limestones exposed in the Black Hills. The Chadron Formation is an avulsion-dominated, siliciclastic unit, yet important bodies of carbonate accumulated in it as a result of groundwater processes.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	1999	46	5					771	789		10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00250.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00250.x													WOS:000083535300001

Therefore, physical processes can have strong effects on fish populations, especially during vulnerable early life history stages. Much of the variability in recruitment of Lake Erie walleye is thought to be caused by variable survival during the egg and larval stages. Recent research on Lake Erie walleye indicates that density-independent physical processes directly affect the vital rates of these early life history stages. In western Lake Erie, large scale storm events in spring were related to high mortality of walleye eggs and larvae on reefs and subsequently produced poor recruitment. In addition, variability in environmental conditions (e.g., water warming rate) prolongs life history stage durations over which high mortality rates operate. Slower water warming rates in western Lake Erie prolonged walleye egg incubation and pelagic larval stages extending the period of vulnerability to disease and predation for these early life history stages and negatively impact year-class strength. Physical processes rarely function independently but facilitate the underlying ecological mechanisms that drive fish population dynamics. Therefore, it is essential to examine physical processes in relation to biological processes in order to gain a more complete understanding of the linkages between them. By doing so, we gain a stronger basis for predicting the response of fish populations to environmental variability.																					1-56612-061-6				1999	16						43	55																WOS:000084758600006

The studies included 13 insecticides used in rape plants protection against pests. All selected pesticides were extracted from water samples by means of solid phase extraction (SPE, carbon black) followed by reverse phase ultra performance liquid chromatography analysis with quadrupole mass detection (RP-UPLC-MS/MS). Totally, 123 samples from lakes, rivers, ponds, field watercourses and drainages were collected (i.e. 79 and 44 in 2006 and 2007, respectively). Of all samples, 36 (29.3%) were contaminated with residues of plant protection products used for protection of rape crops. Contamination with thiametoxam and acetamiprid in 17.1% and 11.4% of the samples, respectively, were mostly detected, and the highest concentration was determined in sample from filed watercourse taken in spring 2007 containing 1.341 mu g/l of acetamiprid. Totally, ten of thirteen studied insecticides were found; however, concentrations of their residues were usually very low. Among all analyzed samples only three exceeded the level of plant protection products established in Directive 2000/60/EC on the level of maximum admissible concentrations (MAC) of harmful substances in water. Although condition of Wielkopolan waters analyzed within the framework of this paper is not alarming, there is a need to take measures directed towards systematic monitoring contamination of water with pesticides used currently in intensive plant production.

J	Brauns, M; Garcia, XF; Pusch, MT				Brauns, Mario; Garcia, Xavier-Francois; Pusch, Martin T.			Potential effects of water-level fluctuations on littoral invertebrates in lowland lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												East-German lowland lakes are highly susceptible to climatic changes, as most lakes are groundwater fed and strongly dependent on the balance of precipitation and evapotranspiration in their catchments. As a significant decrease of precipitation at least during summer is forecasted, a substantial and permanent reduction of lake water levels can be expected. Water-level fluctuations will predominantly affect the eulittoral zone where submerged tree roots form an important habitat type in lowland lakes that will become unavailable for eulittoral invertebrates. Hence, we compared the invertebrate community from eulittoral root habitats with those of infralittoral habitats to test which components of the invertebrate community would be potentially affected by the loss of root habitats, and whether infralittoral habitat types could mitigate these effects. Species richness did not significantly differ between eulittoral roots and the infralittoral habitat types. Community composition of roots significantly differed from that of coarse woody debris, sand and stones but not from reed habitats. Abundances of Coleoptera, Trichoptera and abundances of piercer, predator, shredder and xylophagous species were significantly lower on sand than on roots. Conversely, there were no significant differences in community measures between reed and root habitats except abundances of Coleoptera. Our results suggest that the loss of eulittoral root habitats will cause a significant alteration of the littoral invertebrate community. This could be mitigated if unimpaired reed habitats are available in the infralittoral zone which may serve as a refuge for most species typical for root habitats. Our results need to be verified by direct observations, especially as the extent of future water-level fluctuations is currently not assessable and might be more severe than assumed.					; Brauns, Mario/M-7878-2014; Pusch, Martin/G-6458-2013	Pusch, Martin/0000-0001-9179-013X; Brauns, Mario/0000-0002-5012-9721; 													0018-8158					NOV	2008	613						5	12		10.1007/s10750-008-9467-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9467-0													WOS:000258401000002

They support aquatic and terrestrial consumers at higher trophic levels by conveying dietary nutrients, such as fatty acids. In this study, we combined field sampling and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of environmental parameters, including diet, on fatty acid composition and metabolism in chironomid larvae and imagines. Results from 53 lakes showed that lake size, depth, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and trophic state had only marginal effects on the content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in chironomids. Compound-specific stable hydrogen isotope analyses confirmed that chironomids actively bioconvert dietary fatty acid precursors to LC-PUFA in all lake types, independent of nutrient or DOC concentrations. Moreover, fatty acid-specific stable carbon isotope data indicated that the diet of chironomids was subsidized, particularly in oligotrophic lakes in spring, by terrestrial C18 fatty acid precursors that were converted to LC-PUFA. Data from feeding experiments further confirmed that decreased dietary availability of LC-PUFA enhanced the conversion of dietary short-chain precursors to LC-PUFA. These results suggest that chironomids are PUFA regulators that can sustain LC-PUFA levels under varying environmental conditions. Furthermore, our results indicate that they bioconvert terrestrial low-quality material to high-quality resources, which, via chironomid emergence, support terrestrial food webs. Chironomids are abundant and widespread, and thus, the trophic transfer of LC-PUFA can have significant implications for the fitness and production of upper trophic level consumers in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

However, the reconstruction of these climate proxies from peat bogs is rare in monsoonal regions of the East Asia. This research was carried out on a core from the Shuizhuyang (SZY) peat bog located in Fujian Province. Branched GDGT (brGDGT) indexes were used for reconstructing the paleoclimate of the last 30 cal ka. The aim was to evaluate quantitatively the MAAT and pH values since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the subtropical zone of China. Results show that the CBT-MBT'-derived MAAT at MIS 3 is about 15.6 degrees C on average, which is followed by a significant fall at the LGM (11.7-12.1 degrees C). The temperature difference between the LGM and the present-day value is as high as 5.8 degrees C. The synchronous variation of biomarker and pollen proxies indicates that replacement of subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests by cold tolerant, deciduous broadleaved forests was driven by the significant drop in air temperature. Our results also indicate that the Younger Dryas event lasted from about 12.9 to about 11.3 cal ka, and cooling event at 3.2 cal ka in the late Holocene was detected, showing the sensitivity of peat bogs to rapid cooling. Our pH reconstructions indicate that the pH of the bog rose during Heinrich 1 and Bolling-Allerzd periods, probably due to low precipitation, and were lowest in the Holocene thermal maximum between 8 ka and 2.5 ka, probably due to higher precipitation. The decoupling of reconstructed MAAT and pH during particularly deglaciation and YD periods supports the hypothesis that the variations in temperature and precipitation are not always synchronous.

J	Fyfe, RM; Brown, AG; Rippon, SJ				Fyfe, RM; Brown, AG; Rippon, SJ			Mid- to late-Holocene vegetation history of Greater Exmoor, UK: estimating the spatial extent of human-induced vegetation change	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												This paper presents the results from three pollen profiles from a group of small spring mire sites on the southern edge of Exmoor in south west England. The size and topography of these sites allow detailed local landscape histories around each site to be reconstructed which broadly cover the mid- to late-Holocene. Comparison of the individual local landscape histories demonstrates the scale of spatial variation in vegetation around the upland edge, and facilitates understanding of human-landscape interactions from the early Neolithic onward. In the early Neolithic significant short-term woodland disturbance is recorded around the upland fringe, including clearance of oak-hazel-elm woodland, suggesting that the shift from Mesolithic to Neolithic is not marked by a gradual environmental transition. Following this, there is clear evidence of Neolithic management of upland heath using fire, presumably for the management of upland grazing. Woodland clearances are recorded throughout the later Prehistoric period; however, the use of multiple profiling suggests that woodland clearance is spatially discrete, even within an area of 4 km(2). Pastoral land use is dominant around the uplands until around 900-1,000 A.D., and there is no discernible Roman or post-Roman period impact in the vegetation, suggesting cultural stability from the late Iron Age to the early Medieval period. By 1,100 A.D., there is a shift to mixed arable-pastoral farming which appears to continue well into the post-Medieval period.

Rapid, Quantitative Assessment of Submerged Cultural Resource Degradation Using Repeat Video Surveys and Structure from Motion	JOURNAL OF MARITIME ARCHAEOLOGY												Monitoring, managing and preserving submerged cultural resources (SCR) such as shipwrecks can involve time consuming detailed physical surveys, expensive side-scan sonar surveys, the study of photomosaics and even photogrammetric analysis. In some cases, surveys of SCR have produced 3D models, though these models have not typically been used to document patterns of site degradation over time. In this study, we report a novel approach for quantifying degradation and changes to SCR that relies on diver-acquired video surveys, generation of 3D models from data acquired at different points in time using structure from motion, and differencing of these models. We focus our study on the shipwreck S.S. Wisconsin, which is located roughly 10.2 km southeast of Kenosha, Wisconsin, in Lake Michigan. We created two digital elevation models of the shipwreck using surveys performed during the summers of 2006 and 2015 and differenced these models to map spatial changes within the wreck. Using orthomosaics and difference map data, we identified a change in degradation patterns. Degradation was anecdotally believed to be caused by inward collapse, but maps indicated a pattern of outward collapse of the hull structure, which has resulted in large scale shifting of material in the central upper deck. In addition, comparison of the orthomosaics with the difference map clearly shows movement of objects, degradation of smaller pieces and in some locations, an increase in colonization of mussels.																			1557-2285	1557-2293				AUG	2017	12	2					91	107		10.1007/s11457-017-9172-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11457-017-9172-0													WOS:000407263500001

Effects of repeated daily acute heat challenge on the growth and metabolism of a cold water stenothermal fish	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Temperature is an important environmental factor influencing fish physiology that varies both spatially and temporally in ecosystems. In small north temperate zone lakes, cold water piscivores rely on nearshore prey; however, this region exceeds the optimal temperature of the foraging species during summer. To cope, piscivores make short excursions into the nearshore to feed and return to cold water to digest their meal, but the physiological impacts of these repeated acute exposures to warm water are not well understood. We exposed juvenile lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to treatments where they were held at similar to 10 degrees C and exposed to either 17 or 22 degrees C for 5-10 min daily for 53 days mimicking warm-water forays. Control fish, held at an average temperature of similar to 10 degrees C but not exposed to thermal variation, consumed more food and grew slightly faster than heat challenged fish, with no clear differences in body condition, hepatosomatic index, ventricle mass, or muscle concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase. Aerobic metabolic rates measured at 10 degrees C indicated that standard metabolic rates (SMR) were similar among treatments; however, fish that were repeatedly exposed to 17 degrees C had higher maximum metabolic rates (MMR) and aerobic scopes (AS) than control fish and those repeatedly exposed to 22 degrees C. There were no differences in MMR or AS between fish exposed to 22 degrees C and control fish. These results suggest that although SMR of fish are robust to repeated forays into warmer environments, MMR displays plasticity, allowing fish to be less constrained aerobically in cold water after briefly occupying warmer waters.																			0022-0949	1477-9145				JUN	2019	222	12							jeb198143	10.1242/jeb.198143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.198143								31097605					WOS:000473216700005

Limnology and modern sedimentation patterns in high altitude Tso Moriri Lake, NW Himalaya - implications for proxy development	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We report the results of our investigations on the catchment area, lake surface sediments, and hydrology of the high altitude alpine Tso Moriri Lake, NW Himalayas (India). Our results indicate that the lake is currently alkaline, and thermally stratified with an oxic bottom layer. Results from hydrochemistry and isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta D) of inflowing streams and lake waters show that Tso Moriri Lake is an evaporative lake with contributions from both westerly source (snow melt) and Indian summer monsoon precipitation. Geochemical and mineralogical investigations on the catchment and lake surface sediments reveal the presence of authigenic aragonite in modern lake sediment. The lithogenic components reflect the inflow and sorting processes during transport into the lake, whereas the authigenic carbonate fraction can be linked to the changes in ([precipitation+meltwater]/evaporation) (I/E) balance within the lake. The spatial variability in grain size distribution within the lake surface sediments shows that the grain size data can be utilised as a proxy for transport energy and shoreline proximity in the lake basin. We have evaluated the applicability of commonly applied environmentally sensitive proxies (isotopes, mineralogy, weathering indices) for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in the Tso Moriri Lake. Our results show that the commonly used weathering index (Rb/Sr) is not applicable due to Sr contribution from authigenic carbonates. The useful weathering indices in Tso Moriri Lake are the Si/Al and the Chemical Proxy of Alteration (CPA). Since the carbonates are formed by evaporative processes, their presence and isotopic values can be used as indicators of I/E changes in the lake.					; Ambili, Anoop/AAR-7122-2020; Jehangir, Arshid/AAC-9077-2021; Gaye, Birgit/J-4621-2012; Mishra, Praveen K./AAC-7064-2022	Jehangir, Arshid/0000-0002-4877-609X; Gaye, Birgit/0000-0002-5057-899X; Ambili, Anoop/0000-0002-4279-7842; Mishra, Praveen K./0000-0003-3860-892X													1863-9135					DEC	2014	185	3-4					329	348		10.1127/fal/2014/0664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2014/0664													WOS:000346888400011

The lack of glacialaged marine sedimentary archives around the Bering Land Bridge due to exposure of the shelf during sea level low-stands makes these lakes highly valuable for understanding the region's past climate and environmental changes. Located en route to humanity's last colonized American continents, the Seward Peninsula's climate and environments during the last glacial period bear major anthropological significance. However, a lack of quantitative proxies has so far hampered exploration of these lakes for paleoclimate reconstructions. Here we report, for the first time, the discovery of abundant Group I alkenones and Isochrysidales in surface sediments from three maar lakes: White Fish, North Killeak and Devil Mountain, using a combination of lipid biomarker and 18S rRNA gene sequencing analyses. Our discovery adds to the expanding list of oligotrophic freshwater lakes where Group I alkenones are found, and water chemistry data contribute to the understanding of the environmental controls on Group I Isochrysidales. Our results further confirm the use of the U-37(K) index of Group I alkenones as a proxy for the mean temperature of the spring isotherm (MTSI) and RIK37 as a quantitative measurement for Isochrysidales group mixing. We also demonstrate the analytical challenges for analyzing alkenones in freshwater lakes and the effectiveness of eliminating coelution using silver thiolate chromatographic material (AgTCM).

Laboratory assays found that the potential for NH4-N removal by nitrification and subsequent denitrification was significantly higher in the organic surface sediments than in deeper, sandy, root zone sediments. In a laboratory N-15-tracer experiment, Salix cinerea and Typha orientalis readily assimilated NH4-N from the root zone and were found to enhance the natural diffusion of NH4-N up through the organic sediment layer and into the overlying water, Estimated rates of removal of NH4-N by coupled nitrifiration-denitrification and plant assimilation were 8 to 9 mg of N m(-2) d(-1) and 9 to 46 mg of N m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Assimilated N, returned to the overlying water-sediment surface via litter fall may be subject to sequential mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification, resulting in gaseous N loss, Sixty-five percent of the N-15 in Salix leaf litter was transformed in such a way, The results of this study indicate that plants play a central role in the NH4-N processing capacity of wetlands, The relevance of our findings to constructed wetland design is discussed.																			0047-2425					MAR-APR	1998	27	2					459	466		10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700020029x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700020029x													WOS:000072723300029

All young shrews (n = 55) caught from the islets were natal dispersers. We used several skeletal characters to compare the morphology of the dispersers and the mainland residents. In 3 yr the dispersers were significantly smaller in body size (weight of bones) than the residents, and/or the dispersers had significantly smaller values of specific mandibular characters. These same mandibular characters (but not body weight) were significantly correlated with an individual's performance in neutral arena tests. In the remaining 2 yr, the density of shrews and microtine rodents was high on the mainland, the rate of dispersal to islets was higher than in the other years, and young shrews showed an increased level of fluctuating asymmetry of bilateral morphological characters; but the only morphological differences between the dispersers and the residents were in the lengths of the tibia and hind foot, which were longer in the dispersers. Our results suggest that social subordinates predominated among the dispersers when density and dispersal rate were low (in 3 yr), but when density of shrews and rodents on the mainland was high, dispersal was common and apparently not related to the social position of individuals (in 2 yr).																			0030-1299	1600-0706				OCT	1991	62	1					48	58		10.2307/3545445	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545445													WOS:A1991GP45000008
J	Booker, JF				Booker, James F.			Colorado River Water Use and Climate: Model and Application	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Water availability to meet consumptive use demands over the next century in the Lower Basin of the Colorado River in the southwestern United States is considered under alternative climate and policy scenarios. Modeling reservoir storage and annual releases under scenario alternatives demonstrates that policy can only modestly mitigate losses from potential long run streamflow reductions. The major reservoirs Lake Powell and Lake Mead are treated as composite storage, and Upper Basin depletions are held constant over 97 annual periods beginning with calendar year 2020. Averaged over six climate change scenarios with mean inflow reductions of 22% (reaching 45% by end of century) estimated mean releases fall by 16% to 23% from year 2020 levels depending on decision scenario. Mean releases under the existing Law of the River are 6.1% below the benchmark decision scenario which uses a perfect forecast of future flows. This is largely the result of evaporation losses because reservoir storage across climate scenarios is about double that of the benchmark. In contrast, a decision scenario based on next year and future mean flow expectations shows a release reduction of only 2.6% below the benchmark, and a 2.8% decrease in standard deviation. Across the three decision scenarios, future reservoir storage is well below capacity in almost all years, and under the three higher impact climate scenarios mean storage across the century is only 35% to 40% of capacity.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2022	58	5					673	689		10.1111/1752-1688.13035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13035		JUN 2022											WOS:000815727400001

The lake supports the entire world population of three species or subspecies: Junin Grebe Podiceps taczanowskii, Junin Rail Laterallus tuerosi and the endemic subspecies of the White-tufted Grebe Rollandia rolland morrisoni. Surveys undertaken in the 1930s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s confirmed the lake's importance in the Andes, however there has been no recent assessment of its waterbird community. We undertook waterbird counts between 6 and 20 February 2014 from the lakeshore and by boat. Despite using differing survey methods, we nevertheless conclude that the relative abundance of waterbird species has changed dramatically compared to earlier counts. Most notably, the Junin Grebe has experienced a major decline since the 1930s when the species was considered extremely abundant and another native fish-eating species the White-tufted Grebe also appears to have declined. In contrast the Northern Silvery Grebe Podiceps juninensis, classified as 'Near Threatened', has apparently become more abundant. Numbers of Puna Teal Spatula puna and Common Gallinule Gallinula galeata seem to have crashed, presumably reflecting the general loss of submerged vegetation. In spite of a major decline in waterbirds overall, the Junin area holds numbers of migratory shorebirds, perhaps as a consequence of local hunting restrictions and awareness campaigns. Lake Junin is a candidate for listing on the Montreux Record under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland showing serious change in ecological character. Management planning should proceed to balance conflicting interests at the lake. Actions to re-establish a clear water column by reducing eutrophication (from settlements in the catchment) as well as sedimentation and heavy metals (from upstream mining) will contribute to improving ecological functions and to secure waterbirds including the endemics.

J	Mastin, LG				Mastin, LG			Evidence for water influx from a caldera lake during the explosive hydromagmatic eruption of 1790, Kilauea volcano, Hawaii	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												In 1790 a major hydromagmatic eruption at the summit of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, deposited up to 10 m of pyroclastic fall and surge deposits and killed several dozen Hawaiian natives who were crossing the island. Previous studies have hypothesized that the explosivity of this eruption was due to the influx of groundwater into the conduit and mixing of the groundwater with ascending magma. This study proposes that surface water, not groundwater, was the agent responsible for the explosiveness of the eruption. That is, a lake or pond may have existed in the caldera in 1790 and explosions may have taken place when magma ascended into the lake from below. That assertion is based on two lints of evidence: (1) high vesicularity (averaging 73% of more than 3000 lapilli) and high vesicle number density (10(5)-10(7) cm(-3) melt) of pumice clasts suggest that some phases of the eruption involved vigorous, sustained magma ascent; and (2) numerical calculations suggest that under most circumstances, hydrostatic pressure would not be sufficient to drive water into the eruptive conduit during vigorous magma ascent unless the water table were above the ground surface. These results are supported by historical data on the rate of infilling of the caldera floor during the early 1800s. When extrapolated back to 1790, they suggest that the caldera floor was below the water table.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				SEP 10	1997	102	B9					20093	20109		10.1029/97JB01426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JB01426													WOS:A1997XX12000003

Scribn. are dimorphic (brown and white) and are each enclosed in a lemma and palea. The most complete germination was obtained in lighted (fluorescent light of 1600 lx) growth chambers set at alternating temperatures of 25.degree. C day (14 h) and 10.degree. C night. Seed stratification did not increase total germination, but the rate of germination was increased. The seeds imbibed .apprx. 50% by weight of water before germination was initiated. Under field conditions seeds accumulated in depressions. Seedlings failed to emerge from depths > 6 cm. The survival rate of seedlings was very low (0.5%) during 1978 because of a dry summer, but was considerably higher in 1979 on south slopes (33%), under willow clumps (44%) and on north slopes (56%). Seedling mortality was due to high soil temperatures, desiccation, burial or exposure of seedlings and biotic agents. Seedlings emerged from the soil mainly by elongation of the 1st internode. The coleoptile seemed to act as a protective sheath against high soil temperatures for the growing point enclosed within it. A significantly linear increase in height of seedlings, root length and number of leaves occurred with an increase in the age of seedlings during both years.																			0008-4026						1981	59	4					460	469		10.1139/b81-064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b81-064													WOS:A1981LK66400005
J	Walsby, AE				Walsby, AE			Stratification by cyanobacteria in lakes:: a dynamic buoyancy model indicates size limitations met by Planktothrix rubescens filaments	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The ability of the Planktothrix rubescens to stratify in Lake Zurich is related to the size and shape of the cyanobacterial filaments. Detailed measurements made in the lake are used in a dynamic computer model of buoyancy regulation to investigate the vertical movements of filaments tracking the depth at which the irradiance would support neutral buoyancy. The movement of the filament lags behind the constantly changing target depth owing to (a) the time taken for the filament to respond to the irradiance by changing its density and (b) the time it takes to move by sinking down or floating up through the water column. The model simulates the stratification depth over a 5-month period of the summer from the continuous measurements of irradiance and weekly measurements of light attenuation and temperature, without any further adjustment over the period. Models using filaments of the size observed in Lake Zurich explain several details of the observed depth changes: smaller planktonic cyanobacteria (e.g. Limnothrix sp.) are unable to migrate fast enough and larger ones (e.g. Anabaena spp.) will overshoot and become entrained in the epilimnion. The model can be used to simulate recruitment of Planktothrix filaments from different depths after vernal stratification. Recruitment of filaments from depths down to 45 m will contribute to the metalimnetic population increase in early July.																			0028-646X					NOV	2005	168	2					365	376		10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01508.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01508.x								16219076					WOS:000232441600013

Artificial aeration is often used in lake management to counteract these problems, but the effects of aeration on nitrogen (N) cycling are not known. We studied the effects of hypolimnetic aeration on N dynamics and temperature in a eutrophic lake by comparing continuous and pulsed aeration with a nonaerated station. Aeration decreased the accumulation of NH4+-N deep in the lake (20-33 m) by supplying O-2 for nitrification, which in turn provided substrate for denitrification and promoted N removal. Aeration also increased the temperature in the hypolimnion. Denitrification rate was highest in the nonaerated deep areas (average, 7.62 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) due to very high rates during spring turnover of the water column, demonstrating that natural turnover provides O-2 for nitrification. During stratification, denitrification was highest at the continuously aerated station (4.06 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and lowest at the nonaerated station (3.02 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). At the periodically aerated station, aeration pauses did not restrict the increase in temperature but resulted in accumulation of NH4+-N and decreased the contribution of denitrification as a nitrate reduction process. Our findings demonstrate that hypolimnetic aeration can substantially affect N cycling in lakes and that the effect depends on the aeration strategy. Because N is one of the main nutrients controlling eutrophication, the effects of aeration methods on N removal should be considered as part of strategies to manage water quality in lakes.

Design: Convenience survey of 100 Chicago, Illinois, beachgoers aged 18 to 30 years who were age- and sex-matched with Chicago-area residents who participated in randomdigit-dialed telephone interviews in 1988 and 1994. Setting: Lakefront beach on weekday afternoons in July 2007. Main Outcome Measures: Knowledge of melanoma/ skin cancer link with tanning, and limiting tanning to help prevent melanoma/skin cancer; attitude about the appearance of tanned people; and knowledge of relevant information sources; and UV indoor tanning use in the past year. Results: Knowledge of the melanoma/skin cancer link with tanning changed from 1988 (42%) to 1994 (38%) to 2007 (87%). Knowledge of limiting tanning to help prevent melanoma increased from 1988 (25%) to 1994 (77%), but decreased from 1994 to 2007 (67%). This decline in knowledge about limiting tanning was concurrent with an increase in the attitude that having a tan looks better (1994, 69%; 2007, 81%). Use of indoor tanning beds increased from 1988 (1%) to 1994 (26%) and remained at the same level in 2007 (27%). Although physicians, especially dermatologists, were sources of information about tanning (1988, 2%; 1994, 18%; 2007,3 1%) and were considered the most trusted source, only 14% of respondents in 1994 and 2007 reported ever talking to a doctor about indoor tanning. Conclusion: Because young adults report that physicians are their most trusted source of information about tanning, a potential opportunity exists for physicians to influence indoor tanning behavior by counseling their patients.																			0003-987X	1538-3652				APR	2008	144	4					484	488		10.1001/archderm.144.4.484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archderm.144.4.484								18427042					WOS:000254999300006
J	SPENCE, JR; CARCAMO, HA				SPENCE, JR; CARCAMO, HA			EFFECTS OF CANNIBALISM AND INTRAGUILD PREDATION ON PONDSKATERS (GERRIDAE)	OIKOS												Gerrid-gerrid predation can limit gerrid numbers and affect phenological patterns. In a field experiment with G. pingreensis, survival of small gerrids was dramatically reduced in the presence of larger juvenile instars, and survival of larger nymphs to the adult stage was significantly greater when given access to younger stages than when held by themselves. Mass of teneral female cannibals was significantly greater than that of females not given access to younger stages, but there was no effect on male mass or on development time of either sex. Predation by G. pingreensis on G. buenoi was not consistently more common than cannibalism in either laboratory or field experiments. Thus, dominance of G. pingreensis on permanent lakes does not result from selective depredation of other species, but must relate primarily to life history traits that allow individuals to colonize, breed and develop rapidly in the spring. Intra- and interspecific predation are regulated by a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic contingencies. Starvation and habitats with low complexity were associated with increased levels of gerrid-gerrid predation. Tendency to attack other gerrids is higher in G. pingreensis than in G. buenoi but nymphs of G. buenoi have specific behaviour to avoid being captured by other gerrids. We found no differences in cannibalistic tendencies between males and females, or between pre-diapause and breeding bugs.

However, identifying the origins, magnitude, and primary effects of these actions, especially in East Asia (EA), with a long history of human activity, remains challenging. Crucially, unraveling the early anthropogenic impacts on forest ecosystems has substantial implications for characterizing the Anthropocene. In this study, we collated and synthesized Holocene arboreal pollen (AP) sequences from 61 EA lake basins, which demonstrated an overall expansion of forest vegetation during the early to middle Holocene, followed by a retreat from 5 cal. ka BP. The cooling and drying climate during the mid- and late Holocene proved inimical to forest proliferation across EA. Survival imperatives are likely to drive humans to adopt grazing and farming, causing a transformation from forest land to agro-pastoral land. This change further accelerated forest ecosystem degradation. By dividing EA into five subregions, we observed asynchronous declines in forest vegetation from 8 cal. ka BP to 3 cal. ka BP. This trend is primarily attributed to human impacts, given the pronounced coincidence between forest reduction and emergence and prosperity of Neolithic agriculture in each region. Significantly, the positive feedback loop between population growth and agricultural expansion can amplify human impacts. Coupled with climatic effects, these factors resulted in EA's forest vegetation plummeting to its lowest level since 10 cal. ka BP at 2.1 cal. ka BP. Furthermore, the anthropogenic influences on EA forest vegetation mirror land use, soil erosion, and vegetation variability observed globally in terms of timeline. These alterations are driven by human activities, almost coinciding with shifts in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels away from their natural trajectory. We, therefore, argue that the Anthropocene definition should consider the aggregate environmental impact of human activities over millennia, rather than restricting to the most recent centuries.

J	Gillarduzzi, A				Gillarduzzi, Andrea			Investigating property damage along Dublin Port Tunnel alignment	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-FORENSIC ENGINEERING												During the winter of 2002/2003, Dublin City Council received various complaints regarding aesthetic and serviceability damage of several residential buildings located within the highly populated residential area of Marino (1.8 km northeast of Dublin centre, in the Republic of Ireland) allegedly caused by rock-tunnelling operations of the southwards tunnel-boring machine in the northbound tunnel carried out in execution of the Dublin Port Tunnel scheme. A holistic engineering-geological ground model for the area north of Dublin centre shows that structural elements crossing the bedrock have markedly affected the geological evolution and post-glacial drainage of the site, including the formation of buried valleys. A review of groundwater monitoring and tunnel construction records has allowed the causes of settlement at ground level to be identified. These include volume loss of the ground due to deformation and local failure of the tunnel excavation, dewatering of the bedrock and of coarse strata embedded in the Boulder Clay, resulting in the removal of fine soil particles, vibro-densification due to tunnel-boring machine ground-borne vibrations, and slow production and possibly consolidation of clayey strata. A comparison between the position of the properties where damages are being claimed and that of post-glacial rivulets and lakes, backfilled in the 1920s following a rapid expansion of Dublin suburbs, clearly indicates a direct linkage between the two.																			2043-9903	2043-9911				AUG	2014	167	3					119	142	1300024	10.1680/feng.13.00024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/feng.13.00024													WOS:000219169100003
J	HILLAIREMARCEL, C; CASANOVA, J				HILLAIREMARCEL, C; CASANOVA, J			ISOTOPIC HYDROLOGY AND PALEOHYDROLOGY OF THE MAGADI (KENYA)-NATRON (TANZANIA) BASIN DURING THE LATE QUATERNARY	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Three generations of stromatolites mark the recent extension of paleolakes in the Magadi-Natron basin on the border between Tanzania and Kenya. The last two generations are observed some 50 m above the modern lakes'' level; they are respectively attributed to the beginning of the last interglacial and to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Analysis of the morphology and texture of the stromatolites reveals an ecological zonation between 0 and 10-14 m below the shoreline. Their relatively high .delta.8O and .delta.3C values reflect a long residence time for the paleolake water, which would have been favorable to the establishment of an isotopic equilibrium between atmospheric CO2 and the dissolved inorganic carbon, despite deep carbon inputs in relation to carbonititic volcanism. A study of the 18O, 2H and 13C contents in the hydrothermal springs, perennial rivers and lacustrine brines indicates that, during the last period of significant renewal of the deep saline groupwater, precipitation was depleted in heavy isotopes when compared to modern precipitation. This difference corresponds to a drop of about 600-1000 m in altitudinal "hydroclimatic" zones. Finally, a comparison between the modern and paleohydrological data leads us to believe that the stabilization of the paleolake shorelines at the same altitude can be attributed to control by the water table level in the aquifer of the basaltic plateaus east of the basin.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR	1987	58	3-4					155	181		10.1016/0031-0182(87)90058-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(87)90058-7													WOS:A1987G863000003

Relative importance of phosphorus, fish biomass, and watershed land use as drivers of phytoplankton abundance in shallow lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Phytoplankton abundance in shallow lakes is potentially influenced by ambient phosphorus concentrations, nutrient loading accentuated by human activities in lake watersheds, and abundance of planktivorous and benthivorous fish. However, few studies have simultaneously assessed the relative importance of these factors influencing phytoplankton abundance over large spatial scales. We assessed relative influences of watershed characteristics, total phosphorus concentrations, and fish biomass on phytoplankton abundance in 70 shallow takes in western Minnesota (USA) during summer 2005 and 2006. Our independent variables included total phosphorus (TP), benthivore biomass, planktivore biomass, summed planktivore and benthivore biomass (summed fish), areal extent of agriculture in the watershed, region (prairie versus parkland lakes), and year. Predictive models containing from one to three independent variables were compared using an information theoretic approach. The most parsimonious model consisted of TP and summed fish, and had over 10,000-fold greater support compared to models using just TP or summed fish, or models comprised of other variables. We also found no evidence that relative importance of predictor variables differed between regions or years, and parameter estimates of TP and summed fish were temporally and spatially consistent TP and summed fish were only weakly correlated, and the model using both variables was a large improvement over using either variable alone. This indicates these two variables can independently increase phytoplankton abundance, which emphasizes the importance of managing both nutrients and fish when trying to control phytoplankton abundance in shallow lakes.

In the Grand Lake stock, male fish typically mature at ages 6-7, and females mature at ages 8-9. The five stages of the lifespan (immature, maturing, growth and reproduction, prime reproduction, senescence to death) are compressed into a period of 15-20 years; the prime reproduction period occurs from ages 12 to 16 years for females. This lifespan compares to one of 40-50 years (and occasionally longer), and a prime reproduction period for females from ages 25 to 40 years, for the Yellowstone-Sakakawea stock. The more compressed lifespan of the Grand Lake stock and lower energy storage, as indicated by weights of gonadal fat bodies, are consistent with the framework metabolic theory of ecology. Over the course of a year, fish in Grand Lake are under a much higher metabolic demand than those in Lake Sakakawea. The distinct differences detailed between these two stocks from the southern and northern plains may exist between other paddlefish stocks, other Acipenseriform species, and other fish taxa separated by large latitudinal and climatic differences. The results have specific implications for harvest management and effects of climate change on Acipenseriform life histories and lifespan.																			1064-1262	1547-6553					2011	19	3					279	298		10.1080/10641262.2011.598123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10641262.2011.598123													WOS:000297511300002

We investigated the accuracy of various regression models in predicting algal production, algal biomass, and zooplankton biomass in Redberry Lake, a saline (20 g . L(-1)), phosphorus-rich (average total phosphorus concentration 48 mu g . L(-1)), moderately deep (maximum depth ca. 17 m) lake. Annual primary production rates were 7.6-8.8 times lower than rates predicted from total phosphorus models developed for freshwater lakes whereas mean summer algal biomass was 4.6-9.1 times lower than model predictions. Zooplankton biomass was 1.1-1.8 times higher than model predictions based on total phosphorus concentration, 2.0-2.8 times higher than predictions based on algal biomass, and 5.8-7.9 times higher than predictions based on chlorophyll concentration. Algal carbon turnover times (algal biomass divided by algal productivity) were short, suggesting rapid phytoplankton growth rates. Zooplankton grazing may have depressed phytoplankton accumulation rates and ultimately total primary production. Intense grazing may, in part, be a consequence of the high salinity of Redberry Lake, which limited planktivore abundance and reduced zooplankton diversity, resulting in dominance by large-bodied herbivores (Diaptomus sicilis, Daphnia pulicaria).

J	Shatwell, T; Köhler, J; Nicklisch, A				Shatwell, Tom; Koehler, Jan; Nicklisch, Andreas			Temperature and Photoperiod Interactions with Phosphorus-Limited Growth and Competition of Two Diatoms	PLOS ONE												In lakes, trophic change and climate change shift the relationship between nutrients and physical factors, like temperature and photoperiod, and interactions between these factors should affect the growth of phytoplankton species differently. We therefore determined the relationship between P-limited specific growth rates and P-quota (biovolume basis) of Stephanodiscus minutulus and Nitzschia acicularis (diatoms) at or near light saturation in axenic, semi-continuous culture at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C and at 6, 9 and 12 h d(-1) photoperiod. Photoperiod treatments were performed at constant daily light exposure to allow comparison. Under these conditions, we also performed competition experiments and estimated relative P-uptake rates of the species. Temperature strongly affected P-limited growth rates and relative P uptake rates, whereas photoperiod only affected maximum growth rates. S. minutulus used internal P more efficiently than N. acicularis. N. acicularis was the superior competitor for P due to a higher relative uptake rate and its superiority increased with increasing temperature and photoperiod. S. minutulus conformed to the Droop relationship but N. acicularis did not. A model with a temperature-dependent normalised half-saturation coefficient adequately described the factor interactions of both species. The temperature dependence of the quota model reflected each species' specific adaptation to its ecological niche. The results demonstrate that increases in temperature or photoperiod can partially compensate for a decrease in P-quota under moderately limiting conditions, like during spring in temperate lakes. Thus warming may counteract de-eutrophication to some degree and a relative shift in growth factors can influence the phytoplankton species composition.

This study concerns the Eocene sedimentary succession in the Dongying Depression and recognizes a third-order sequence based on the stacking patterns of lithofacies, mineralogical changes, and geochemical proxies. The total organic carbon content, RockEval parameters S1 and S2 values, and the chloroform bitumen "A" content are low in the lowstand systems tracts, reaching their maxima within the transgressive systems tracts and gradually decreasing within the highstand systems tracts. The paleoclimate index and ratios of quartz/feldspar, Sr/Ca, TiO2/Al2O3, Cr/Al, Ni/V, Th/U, Zn/Al, and Ni/Al indicate that OM accumulation was influenced by primary productivity, sedimentation rate (SR), and redox conditions, which are intimately related to the sequence development under the influence of tectonics, climate, sediment supply, and relative lake-level fluctuations. The OM distribution is related to the sequence stratigraphy in three ways: (1) climate and relative lake-level fluctuations affected the primary productivity and OM production via algae blooms and terrestrial OM input; (2) relative lake-level fluctuations and sediment supply were influenced by tectonics and climate, causing a change in SR and OM deposition; and (3) relative lake-level fluctuations under different climatic conditions affected the development of anoxic bottomwater favoring OM preservation.

Are anglers exposed to Escherichia coli from an agriculturally impacted river?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Pine River, in the central, Lower Peninsula region of Michigan, has a long history of contamination. Livestock facilities and manure application sites along the Pine River and its tributaries have led to elevated nutrient levels. In addition to nutrient loading and associated low levels of dissolved oxygen, the presence Escherichia coli bacteria have caused environmental and human health concerns. According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, E. coli counts in summer months consistently have exceeded safe levels for human contact since 2005. Though it is recommended that residents do not swim in the Pine River, there are no specific restrictions on recreational fishing which is prevalent. Few studies have evaluated whether or not E. coli accumulates in the mucus of fish and, if so, whether that provides a viable route of E. coli exposure for anglers. This study first evaluated the presence of fecal coliform and E. coli bacteria on hatchery-raised caged fish placed in the river as well as resident fish. Results showed that fecal coliform and E. coli bacteria accumulated both on caged and resident fish. This result led to further testing showing E. coli to be found on anglers' hands whether or not they handled or interacted with resident fish. This study suggests that fishing in rivers with heavy bacterial loading from agricultural runoff may expose anglers to potentially harmful E. coli.					; Hamilton, Bonnie/HKW-8785-2023	Hamilton, Bonnie/0000-0002-4721-9451; Harwood, Amanda/0000-0001-5644-6747													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR 5	2020	192	4								10.1007/s10661-020-8168-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8168-7								32140849					WOS:000519256400003

Coupled landscape-lake evolution in High Arctic Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We profiled five ice-covered lakes and two ice-covered fiords of Ellesmere Island at the northern limit of High Arctic Canada to examine their environmental characteristics, and to evaluate the long-term limnological consequences of changes in their surrounding landscape through time (landscape evolution). All of the ecosystems showed strong patterns of thermal, chemical, and biological stratification with subsurface temperature maxima from 0.75 to 12.15 degrees C; conductivities up to 98.1 mS cm(-1) (twice that of seawater) in some bottom waters; pronounced gradients in nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, manganese, iron, and oxygen; and stratified photosynthetic communities. These ecosystems form an inferred chronosequence that reflects different steps of landscape evolution including marine embayments open to the sea, inlets blocked by thick sea ice (Disraeli Fiord, Taconite Inlet), perennially ice-capped, saline lakes isolated from the sea by isostatic uplift (Lakes A, C1, C2), and isolated lakes that lose their ice cover in summer. The latter are subject to entrainment of saline water into their upper water column by wind-induced mixing (Lake Romulus; Lake A in 2000), or complete flushing of their basins by dilute snowmelt (Lake C3 and Char Lake, which lies 650 km to the south of the Ellesmere lakes region). This chronosequence illustrates how changes in geomorphology and other landscape properties may influence the limnology of coastal, high-latitude lakes, and it provides a framework to explore the potential impacts of climate change.

USEPA-PMF5.0 was run and the analysis resolved eight factors which represents eight sources identified by their chemical profiles together with tracer species. The sources resolved were: Secondary sulphate (25.2%), resuspended dust (23.6%), residential cookstove (13.4%), smelter and non -tail -pipe emissions (11.3%), vehicular emissions (10.8%), lake and sea salt (8.5%), secondary nitrate (4.8%), and brick kilns (2.2%). Winter and post -monsoon PM concentrations in the region were majorly regulated by secondary sulphate and residential cookstove emissions, contributing to 22% and 22-27%, respectively. Dust storms prevalent in the region during pre -monsoon and monsoon resulted in higher resuspended dust contribution (30-43%) from crustal sources during these seasons. Salt lakes in the region influenced the fine PM mass with its effect aggravated during the monsoon by the sea -salts from the Arabian Sea. The fine PM mass was impacted by salt lakes in the area, which is exacerbated during the monsoon by sea -salts from the Arabian Sea. Smelters, nontailpipe emissions, and vehicular emissions were substantial contributors to moderately polluted to poor conditions (PM2.5 loadings >60 mu g m(-3)). Furthermore, highest PM(2.5 )concentrations (>90 mu gm(-3)) marking the very poor conditions in the region were attributed to residential cookstove emissions and secondary sulphate. While vehicular emissions were found to be primarily from local sources, numerous smelters from northern states had potential influence on PM mass. The prominent seasonality in the source contributions observed in this study is particularly suggestive of substantial influence of meteorology on PM concentrations in the region.

J	Amano, Y; Takahashi, K; Machida, M				Amano, Yoshimasa; Takahashi, Kosei; Machida, Motoi			Competition between the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the diatom Cyclotella sp under nitrogen-limited condition caused by dilution in eutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												The improvement of water quality in Lake Tega, Japan, has been carried out by dilution, causing the shift of dominant species from Microcystis aeruginosa to Cyclotella sp. in summer. The disappearance of Microcystis blooms would be related to dilution, but the detail effect has not been understood yet. In this study, the effect of nitrate concentration on the competition between M. aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp. was investigated through the single-species and the competitive culture experiments. The single-species culture experiment indicated that the half saturation constants for M. aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp. were 0.016 and 0.234 mg N L-1, representing that M. aeruginosa would possess a higher affinity to nitrate. On the other hand, the maximum growth rate for Cyclotella sp. was obtained as 0.418 day(-1), which did not represent a significant difference with 0.366 day(-1) obtained for M. aeruginosa. The competitive culture experiment revealed that Cyclotella sp. completely dominated over M. aeruginosa at the nitrate concentrations of 0.5 and 2.5 mg N L-1. The dominance of Cyclotella sp. could be attributed to the difference in the abilities of nitrate storage as well as nitrate uptake. One of the possibilities for the disappearance of Microcystis blooms caused by dilution as observed in Lake Tega could be due to the decrease in nitrate concentration, and the lower N:P ratio seemed not to relate to Microcystis blooms.					; MACHIDA, Motoi/D-7533-2015	MACHIDA, Motoi/0000-0001-5197-660X; 													0921-8971					AUG	2012	24	4					965	971		10.1007/s10811-011-9718-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-011-9718-8													WOS:000306219900037

Parallel divergence of sympatric genetic and body size forms of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, from two Scottish lakes	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												F-ST and R-ST estimates for Arctic charr from six microsatelite markers collected from two neighbouring Scottish lakes, Loch Maree and Loch Stack, confirm the presence of two distinct genetic groupings representing separate populations within each lake. In both lakes, there was also a clear body size dimorphism, with large and small body size forms that segregated according to genetic grouping. There was evidence of only subtle foraging ecology differences between morphs, with the small body size morph in both lakes being more generalist in its foraging in the summer (consuming mostly plankton but also some macrobenthos) than the large body size morph, which specialized on planktonic prey. Trophic morphology (head and mouth shape) did not differ significantly between morphs (although the small sample size for Maree makes this a preliminary finding). Cluster analysis of the microsatelite data and the presence of private alleles showed that morphologically similar forms in different lakes were not genetically similar, as would be expected under a multiple invasion hypothesis. Thus, the data do not support a hypothesis of a dual invasion of both lakes by two common ancestors but instead suggest an independent origin of the two forms in each lake. Thus parallel sympatric divergence as a result of common selection pressures in both lakes is the most parsimonious explanation of the evolutionary origin of these polymorphisms.

Impact of enhanced summer temperatures on the distribution and structure of zooplankton communities in the heated stratified lakes: Implications for climate change	LIMNOLOGICA												Long-term studies demonstrated that temperature increases of 3-6 degrees C above natural levels caused reduction in zooplankton biomass. We hypothesized that large-bodied species would respond more strongly to temperature increases than small-bodied species because they are less adapted to high temperatures. Studies were conducted in three similar stratified meso-eutrophic lakes with different thermal regimes. Enhanced temperature, migrations, food abundance and dissolved oxygen concentrations were analyzed as potential factors that could affect zooplankton biomass. The warmest lake differed from the other lakes by lower total biomass of zooplankton less abundance of large-bodied zooplankton species, smaller population body sizes of abundant cladoceran species and higher food concentrations. Day and night abundances of zooplankton did not differ between the vertical strata and between the pelagic and littoral zones in the three study lakes suggesting that zooplankton did not vertical or horizontal migrations. We suggest that decreases of dissolved oxygen below the epilimnion prevented zooplankton from vertically migrating. As a result, zooplankton accumulated in the epilimnion where temperatures were higher than in the lower strata. Regression analysis showed that temperature had a significant negative impact on the total biomass of zooplankton in the epilimnion of the warmest study lake. Therefore, our results are in accordance with the ecological Bergmann's and James' rules dealing with the temperature-size relationships.

J	Vilicic, D				Vilicic, Damir			OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS IN THE KRKA ESTUARY	HRVATSKE VODE												The Krka River estuary is a unique, internationally recognized natural phenomenon in the karst of northern Dalmatia (Croatia). Nutrient-poor water from the small Krka River enters the sea under narrow tidal range conditions and creates a highly stratified system with a sharp halocline separating brackish and marine layers. Highly stratified estuaries are rare and are found along small Mediterranean rivers. Freshwater phytoplankton entering the estuary from Lake Visovac, a widening of the river, dies in the salinity gradient of the halocline. Suspended particles accumulating in the halocline significantly heat up the halocline in summer. Microbial decomposition of organic matter releases nutrients into the marine layer of the upper estuary, causing a development of marine phytoplankton subsurface blooms. In the lower estuary, phytoplankton blooms are superficial because growth at greater depths is limited by light. The mixing of fresh water and the sea, especially in the halocline (freshwater/ seawater interface), dramatically changes the balance of chemical reactions. The halocline is a microlayer in which toxic substances accumulate as well. The cycling of elements is present in the estuary.																			1330-1144					JUL	2024	32	128					127	140																WOS:001417877000002

Using a sediment fingerprinting approach from the multivariate mixing model, the spatiotemporal sources of geology and land use were identified in a small agricultural catchment in southwest China. Results showed that sediment accumulation rates (SARs) were estimated to range from 0.002 to 0.065 g cm(-2) a(-1) (mean 0.015 +/- 0.016 g cm(-2) a(-1)), which has a positive correlation with instrumental Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) precipitation. Time-integrated sources were divided into four zones in combination with the changes in SARs, which were qualitatively and quantitively interpreted by particle size, and precipitation, and historical land use polies over the past similar to 160 years. Spatially, Quaternary granite (QG) in geology and channel bank (CB) in land use were the dominant contributors to the lakeshore sediment, respectively. Two relatively higher contributions of abandoned land (AL) to lakeshore sediment were found during the periods of 1930s-1950s and post-1990s, which originated from the dual impacts of topographical factors of slope gradient and elevation, and socioeconomic factors of the gap of farmer's expenditure to income. The results illustrate that restricting the farmland to be abandoned would be useful for reducing the soil erosion within the lake-catchment system.

Regional synchrony of brown trout and brook trout population dynamics among Michigan rivers	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The ability to describe regional patterns in trout density would be useful for biologists concerned with population status across large regions as well as managers of rivers at the local scale. Noting the importance of flow conditions at the time of emergence to trout year-class strength in Michigan streams and the influence of age-0 trout abundance on subsequent abundance of older age-classes, we assessed the potential for regional synchrony in the population dynamics of brown trout Salmo trutta and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis among Michigan rivers. We used correlation analyses to look for regional synchrony in May stream discharge (approximating the time of brown trout fry emergence) and fall trout density among many Michigan trout streams. We found a high degree of synchrony in average May discharge among streams, particularly those in the northern portion of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. There were significant correlations in the long-term densities of brown trout and brook trout year-classes among several rivers in this area, including sites up to 140 km apart and rivers draining into different Great Lakes. Predicted numbers of days to 50% swim-up of brown trout fry were similar among four streams and synchronous, further supporting the hypothesis of synchrony in trout population dynamics in Michigan streams at the regional scale. Long-term trout population estimates and streamflow data collected from a network of long-term index (fixed) sites throughout Michigan will aid in further description of the spatial extent of synchrony in trout populations.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2007	136	3					706	717		10.1577/T06-275.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T06-275.1													WOS:000246992600012

This study focuses on the effect of an extended dissolved oxygen (DO) full-life dynamics (86 days) on metal behavior across the sedimentwater interface through laboratory microcosms from two typical zones in Pearl River Estuary. Combining our time-series results of concentrations and fluxes, it showed that Co, Ni, and Zn consistently presented a releaseprecipitation-release trajectory with an oxic-hypoxic-anoxic-reoxic transition, characterized with highly variable behavior in the hypoxic-anoxic hotmoments. In parallel, changing DO dynamics significantly activated a repartitioning process of Co, Ni, and Zn among several species and elevated their risk in sediments, promoting the formation of more labile species in the 0-10 mm hotspots, where metals sensitively responded. Over DO transition, metal cycling was tightly co-related with Fe, Mn, and S elements. It was found that Mn was dominated in low oxygen-hypoxic period, but switched to S and Fe in anoxic stage, limiting sustained metal liberation to overlying water. Enlarging this experiment to practice, released Zn fluxes from sediments in hypoxic summer could contribute about similar to 2.0% to their stocks in water column, while increase to 20% (1 m bottom water) in highly-stratified zones. This study has certain significance in understanding the long-term metal behavior and fate in estuarine regions, even lakes and reservoirs.

Unfortunately, tubes that fit his hammer-gravity corer design are no longer conveniently available for purchase and, with his sudden passing, Glew gravity and coring equipment is difficult or impossible to access. In some field-sampling situations, other commercially available equipment present limitations. Here, we provide an updated design of the Glew gravity corer which accommodates a hammer-percussion instrument and overcomes limitations we have encountered when coring lakes in remote locations from floats of a helicopter or small, inflatable watercraft. Our approach integrates the 'best of both worlds' provided by the Glew and commercially available Uwitec designs, using readily available components. We updated the Glew corer tube collar to be compatible with standard, commercially available 90-mm external diameter (86-mm internal diameter) PVC tubing that fits Uwitec components (e.g., Uwitec rubber 'piston' and 'stoppers'; using terminology of the Uwitec catalogue), and designed a spring-loaded gasket-style plunger that achieves greater suction than the standard Glew designs. We also updated the Glew vertical sectioner to be compatible with 90-mm-diameter core tubes typically ranging from 60-120 cm long. An outcome is consolidation of the Uwitec and Glew gravity coring systems, which has allowed for interchangeability and choice among use of original and hammer-driven Glew, Uwitec, and the new hybrid 'Uwi-Glew-ee' gravity corer and sectioner configurations, depending on logistical constraints of fieldwork and anticipated lake sediment composition.

In 2023, a severe drought negatively affected a Texas watershed known as Lake Austin that fed a large expanse of wetlands on East Matagorda Bay. To study the hypersalinity problem in these wetlands, we identified freshwater inflows and mapped vegetation changes over time. We found that from 1943 to 2023, the upper portion of the Lake Austin watershed lost freshwater wetlands to agricultural conversion, and ranged from fresh to brackish, with salinity rapidly rising to a maximum of 31 mS during the summer drought of 2023. The lower portion of the watershed gained saltwater wetlands due to sea level rise, and marshes became hypersaline (64-96 mS) during the 2023 drought, endangering its biota. But after large precipitation events, the entire Lake Austin basin rapidly freshened but then returned to its normal salinities within a week as the tides re-delivered saltwater into its basin. Given current climatic trends, we expect that freshwater inflow will continue to slightly increase for the Lake Austin watershed but also that there will be more extreme periods of episodic drought that negatively affect its wetlands. Accordingly, we assessed several potential restoration actions that would improve freshwater flow and delivery to the Lake Austin coastal wetlands.

Mesozooplankton (> 150 mum) were excluded in the experiment, but micrograzers such as heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates and copepod nauplii were present. The humic substances were isolated from river water using a macroporous resin (XAD-8). Trace metals, iron and vitamins were added in order to avoid growth limitation caused by these compounds. Phytoplankton biomass and primary production became significantly higher in treatments where nitrate or humic substances were added than in control flasks. Bacterial numbers became significantly higher in the treatments where humic substances were added compared with controls. Ammonium concentrations became elevated in the treatments where nitrate or humic substances were added. It seems likely that humic substances were utilized by bacteria both as a carbon and a nitrogen source and that nitrogen was incorporated in bacteria and later regenerated as inorganic nitrogen due to the activity of bacterial grazers and other grazers of higher trophic levels. We suggest that this is the mechanism by which nitrogen in humic substances becomes available for coastal phytoplankton communities.

J	Walsh, JR; Munoz, SE; Vander Zanden, MJ				Walsh, Jake R.; Munoz, Samuel E.; Vander Zanden, M. Jake			Outbreak of an undetected invasive species triggered by a climate anomaly	ECOSPHERE												When an invasive species appears at a new location, we typically have no knowledge of the population dynamics leading up to that moment. Is the establishment of invasive propagules closely followed by the appearance of the population? Or alternatively, was there an established low-density population that was released from a constraint and crossed the detection threshold? The early stages of the invasion process are a critical gap in our knowledge, yet vitally important for the detection and management of invasions. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence supporting the lag scenario for an invasive species outbreak. The invasive predatory zooplankton, spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), was detected in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (USA), in summer of 2009 and rapidly reached and sustained exceptionally high densities. To evaluate whether Bythotrephes' outbreak immediately followed introduction or erupted from an established low-density population, we constructed a population model of Bythotrephes in Lake Mendota. In the model, Bythotrephes persisted indefinitely at low levels until favorable thermal conditions in 2009, the coolest July since at least 1895, allowed it to erupt to high densities and establish a large egg bank in the lake sediments. The egg bank stabilized the population in the high-density state despite a return to nonfavorable thermal conditions, which is further supported by demographic data suggesting a constant contribution from the egg bank during the year. The prolonged lag scenario is corroborated by the detection of two individual Bythotrephes in pre-2009 archived samples, and the detection of Bythotrephes spines in lake sediment core layers dating back to 1994 (+/- 5 yr). Together, our results suggest that Bythotrephes persisted for at least a decade below the detection limit, until optimal thermal conditions triggered a population outbreak. This work highlights the potential for environmental conditions to trigger invasive species outbreaks from low-density populations.

In this study, we aimed to determine the fecal coliform, spoilage bacteria, and antimicrobial-resistant bacterial contamination in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farms. Fish were sampled from rainbow trout farms that have a high production capacity and are established on spring water, stream water, and dammed lakes in six different regions of Turkey. A total of seven Enterobacter subspecies, two strains of Pseudomonas spp., and one isolate each of Morganella and Stenotrophomonas were characterized based on biochemical and molecular methods, including the 16S rRNA and gyrB housekeeping gene regions. The sequencing results obtained from the 16S rRNA and gyrB gene regions were deposited in the GenBank database and compared with isolates from different countries, which were registered in the database. Resistance to 10 different antimicrobial compounds was determined using the broth microdilution method, and molecular resistance genes against florfenicol, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole were identified by PCR. All detected resistance genes were confirmed by sequencing analyses. E. cloacae, E. asburiae, Pseudomonas spp., S. maltophilia, and M. psychrotolerans were identified using the gyrB housekeeping gene, while isolates showed different biochemical characteristics. All isolates were found to be phenotypically resistant to sulfamethoxazole, and some isolates were resistant to tetracycline, florfenicol, amoxicillin, and doxycycline; the resistance genes of these isolates included floR, tetC, tetD, and tetE. We showed that fecal coliforms, spoilage bacteria, and antimicrobial resistant bacteria were present in farmed rainbow trout, and they pose a threat for human health and must be controlled in the farming stage of fish production.

Wild Bird Migration across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: A Transmission Route for Highly Pathogenic H5N1	PLOS ONE												Background: Qinghai Lake in central China has been at the center of debate on whether wild birds play a role in circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times. Methodology/Principal Findings: To better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered. From 2003-2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese. Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds. Their potential as a vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study to compare phylogenetics of the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.					; Douglas, David/AAU-1087-2021; Hill, Nichola/G-4003-2011; Tang, Mingjie/NTQ-4211-2025	/0000-0003-3213-6693; Douglas, David/0000-0003-0186-1104; Prosser, Diann/0000-0002-5251-1799; Palm, Eric/0000-0002-5330-4804													1932-6203					MAR 9	2011	6	3							e17622	10.1371/journal.pone.0017622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017622								21408010					WOS:000288170900031

Bioassays of the planktonic communities consistently suggested acute N limitation, no limitation, or P limitation, depending on the time at which we chose to terminate the experiment. Enclosures (17 m2) deployed in one lake indicated N limitation but increased sedimentation and water transparency in the enclosures. Although short-term bioassays consistently indicated limitation by N, whole-lake fertilization produced only a small and transient increase in chlorophyll a and primary production or no response at all. Some lakes are mildly limited by N during summer; others appear to be limited by light. In the latter, bioassays and whole-lake fertilization lead to inconsistent conclusions. A steady state model of phytoplankton biomass (as Chl a) under excess nutrient concentrations is proposed to facilitate the diagnosis of light limitation in shallow and turbid water bodies. Model predictions are consistent with mean column critical irradiance (PAR) of 1.6 MJ m-2 d-1 (7.36 Einst m-2 d-1) previously reported for net phytoplankton growth in marine and freshwater systems.

J	Anurag, H; Ng, GHC				Anurag, Harsh; Ng, G-H Crystal			Assessing future climate change impacts on groundwater recharge in Minnesota	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Although the northern Laurentian Great Lakes region is projected to undergo major climate changes, it has had a paucity of future groundwater recharge studies. We used the state of Minnesota (USA) as a testbed to understand how recharge will respond to changing climate in upper mid-latitude, low-elevation temperate settings. Not only can this inform water resource management, but it can help probe difficult-to-predict sign changes in recharge in temperate zones, as well as the under-studied land-surface processes controlling them. Our study implemented the Community Land Model with ensemble outputs from five climate models under two emissions scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) to investigate future changes in recharge for 2026-2055 relative to the baseline historical period of 1976-2005. We found that despite quite consistent projections of higher precipitation (P) and some local occurrences of increased recharge, state-average recharge will mostly decline or remain about the same due to warming-induced evapotranspiration (ET) increases. However, our simulations showed that several processes serve to buffer recharge decreases. In drier ecoregions in the west, soil moisture limitations start to constrain evapotranspiration, thus curbing reductions in recharge. These regions also include higher historical surface runoff due to its runoff-prone soils, and because much of future reductions in net atmospheric inputs (P-ET) are partitioned to lower this runoff instead of recharge, decreases in recharge are further modulated. Statewide warming also lessens frozen ground coverage, reapportioning early spring runoff of snowmelt to infiltration and recharge. Our results demonstrate that in addition to precipitation change and warming, moisture feedbacks on ET and the influence of hydrogeological properties and frozen ground dynamics on runoff must be considered when quantifying climate change impacts on recharge in temperate zones.

V.			Trans-Pacific dust events observed at Whistler, British Columbia during INTEX-B	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The meteorology and physico-chemical characteristics of aerosol associated with two new cases of long range dust transport affecting western Canada during spring 2006 are described. Each event showed enhancements of both sulfate aerosol and crustal material of Asian origin. However, the events were of quite different character and demonstrate the highly variable nature of such events. The April event was a significant dust event with considerable enhancement of fine particle sulfate while the May event was a weaker dust event, also with significant fine particle sulfate enhancement. The latter event was notable in the sense that it was of short duration and was quickly followed by a large increase of organic material likely of regional origin. Comparison of these two events with other documented cases extending back to 1993, suggests that all dust events show coincident enhancements of sulfate and crustal aerosol. However, events vary across a wide continuum based on the magnitude of aerosol enhancements and their sulfate to calcium ratios. At one extreme, events are dominated by highly significant crustal enhancements (e.g. the well-documented 1998 and 2001 'dust' events) while at the other are events with some dust transport, but where sulfate enhancements are of very high magnitude (e.g. the 1993 event at Crater Lake and the 15 May 2006 event at Whistler). Other events represent a 'mix'. It is likely that this variability is a function of the comparative strengths of the dust and anthropogenic SO2 sources, the transport pathway and in particular the extent to which dust is transported across industrial SO2 sources, and finally, meteorological and chemical processes.					; van Donkelaar, Aaron/AAF-8355-2021; Zhang, Qi/F-9653-2010; Martin, Randall/C-1205-2014	Leaitch, Warren Richard/0000-0003-1503-5639; Martin, Randall/0000-0003-2632-8402													1680-7316	1680-7324					2008	8	20					6297	6307		10.5194/acp-8-6297-2008	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-8-6297-2008													WOS:000260558500021

Features of the Structure of Macrozoobenthos of Watercourses in the Conditions of an Intact, Heavily Swamped Area: The Basin of Lake Vodlozero and the Vodla River (Vodlozersky National Park, Lake Onega Basin)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The features of the composition, diversity, abundance, and trophic structure of macrozoobenthos in nine rivers of the Vodlozersky National Park and its buffer zone (Ileksa, Verkhnyaya Okhtoma, Novguda, Kelka, Okhtoma, Sukhaya Vodla, Vama, Lepruchei, and Vodla) are analyzed. A total of 17 stations were surveyed in the summer of 2019 and 2022. Vodlozersky Park is one of the largest untouched areas in Europe, characterized by high swampiness and low-mineralized, highly colored waters. In the macrozoobenthos of rivers, chironomid larvae are leaders in abundance. Along with them, there are numerous caddisflies on boulder-pebble soils, oligochaetes on sandy soils, and bivalves on silt-clay-detritus soils. The areas located at the source of the lake are particularly abundant. The greatest alpha-diversity is observed in the biotope of boulder-pebble soils. The differences between biotopes in the ratio of trophic groups lie in the predominance of collectors-filters in fast flows and collectors-gatherers in slow flows.

The protein-like FDOM (FDOMT) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed epilimnetic accumulation (FDOMT from 4.42 +/- 0.22 quinine sulfate units [QSU] to 6.30 +/- 0.04 QSU; DOC from 80.8 +/- 2.7 mu mol L-1 to 102.7 +/- 3.5 mu mol L-1) between nutrient-replete winter mixing to nutrient-depleted stratified periods. This accumulation is attributed to the reduced heterotrophic activity following severe P-limitation. The positive correlation between accumulated DOC and FDOMT in the epilimnion and their uniform reduction in the hypolimnion (similar to 9%) suggest FDOMT as a proxy for semi-labile DOM. The humic-like FDOM (FDOMM) generally increased with depth, a pattern similar to nutrients and total carbon dioxide (TCO2), but adverse to dissolved oxygen. The significant positive correlations of FDOMM with apparent oxygen utilization (r = 0.86, p < 0.001), TCO2 (r = 0.91, p < 0.001), nitrate (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), and phosphate (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) in the deeper layers suggest that FDOMM is formed during hypolimnetic mineralization. We estimated that similar to 8% of the organic carbon degraded in the hypolimnion is transferred into humic substances. The minor contribution of DOC (6.4%) to hypolimnetic mineralization suggests that production of humic substances is mainly fueled by the mineralization of sinking biogenic particles. The production and consumption of FDOM in freshwater lakes may influence the quality and bioavailability of carbon exported from these systems.

Impact of Sedimentation on Water Seepage Capacity in Lake Nakuru, Kenya	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE												Accumulation and deposition of sediments in waterbody affect the seepage capacity that could lead to improper water balance and results in the water level rise. This study analysed the influence of sedimentation on seepage capacity in Lake Nakuru and the impact of sediment characteristics to the water seepage and the flow rate formation at the lake bed level. The study was performed by sampling and analysing the sediment cores from two locations in the lake. The sediment hydraulic properties, i.e., moisture and porosity, particle sizes, and hydraulic conductivity, were determined using the oven-drying method, sieve analysis, hydrometer analysis, and falling head tests, respectively. The results showed that the lake sediment sample from location P1 had an average ratio of 39.38% for silty soil, 34.00% for clayey sediment, and 26.63% for fine-sand sediment particles with the maximum permeability coefficient of 3.37 (*) 10(-5) cm/s, while the one from location P2 had an average ratio of 63.17% for sand, 20.17% for fine particles, and 16.67% for gravels with the maximum permeability coefficient of 0.010793 cm/s. The hydraulic conductivity of sediment sample from location P1 and P2 increased along the core depth. This could lead to the rise of water level due to the decreases of water movement induced from the sediment cementation in the top layers under the waterbody. Sedimentation affects Lake Nakuru water volume and water balance; hence, there is a need to control the inflow of sediment resulting from anthropogenic activities in the watershed.					; Iradukunda, Parfait/AAL-4878-2021	Iradukunda, Parfait/0000-0002-2670-3770; 													1687-7667	1687-7675				FEB 16	2021	2021								8889189	10.1155/2021/8889189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8889189													WOS:000627330900001

After a two-month incubation of MPs, molecular analyses were carried out to isolate the genetic material of bacteria present in the biofilm. Next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed to identify species. Bacterial abundance was also determined in the lake water (2.31 - 4.26 Mcell ml-1 ) and in the water from experimental baskets containing MPs (0.58 - 4.68 Mcell ml-1 ). The biofilm formed on the MPs was analysed at various systematic levels, including phylum, family, class, genus, and species. A total of 18 species were identified, with a high percentage of the Proteobacteria phylum noted. This may indicate that this group favours MPs regardless of the trophic level. In this study, the presence of bacteria with the ability to degrade polymers, such as Pseudomonas putida , was observed, as well as Lacibacterium aquatile , which can indicate water quality. Among the other identified bacterial species, several pathogens were found, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candidatus Saccharibacteria , and Candidatus Cardinium , which may indicate anthropogenic pollution. The presence of E. coli was detected on MPs in each of the studied lakes, suggesting that MPs may serve as a new vector for dangerous pathogens, regardless of trophic status. Despite the two-month experiment, no statistically significant differences in bacterial species diversity (as measured by alpha and beta indices) were observed between lakes with different trophy.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Late-glacial and Holocene vegetation and climate variability, including major droughts, in the Sky Lakes region of southeastern New York State	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Sediment cores from Lakes Minnewaska and Mohonk in the Shawangunk Mountains of southeastern New York were analyzed for pollen, plant macrofossils, macroscopic charcoal, organic carbon content, carbon isotopic composition, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and lithologic changes to determine the vegetation and landscape history of the greater Catskill Mountain region since deglaciation. Pollen stratigraphy generally matches the New England pollen zones identified by Deevey (1939) and Davis (1969), with boreal genera (Picea, Abies) present during the late Pleistocene yielding to a mixed Pinus, Quercus and Tsuga forest in the early Holocene. Lake Minnewaska sediments record the Younger Dryas and possibly the 8.2 cal kyr BP climatic events in pollen and sediment chemistry along with an similar to 1400 cal yr interval of wet conditions (increasing Tsuga and declining Quercus) centered about 6400 cal yr BP. Both Minnewaska and Mohonk reveal a protracted drought interval in the middle Holocene, similar to 5700-4100 cal yr BP, during which Pinus rigida colonized the watershed, lake levels fell, and frequent fires led to enhanced hillslope erosion. Together, the records show at least three wet-dry cycles throughout the Holocene and both similarities and differences to climate records in New England and central New York. Drought intervals raise concerns for water resources in the New York City metropolitan area and may reflect a combination of enhanced La Nina, negative phase NAO, and positive phase PNA climatic patterns and/or northward shifts of storm tracks.

A study was initiated in a 64-yr-old trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stand in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan to determine changes in nutrient dynamics and secondary succession following patch clear-cutting. One hectare replicated patch cuts were logged in the winter of 1993-1994. There was no site preparation following harvest. Annual vegetation, regeneration and soil and plant nutrient data were collected annually, 1 yr prior to, and 3 yr following harvest. Aspen regeneration was 48 375 stems ha(-1) 2 yr after treatment. Stand (alpha) diversity of the understory was not affected by harvesting, although annual species turnover (beta diversity) increased slightly after harvest. There was an increase in aspen foliar nitrogen (N) for 2 yr following harvest. Soil nutrient concentrations did not differ between patch cut and unharvested plots except total potassium (18% lower in the LFH of the harvested treatments 3 yr after harvesting). Small patch cuts with the litter horizon kept intact may be appropriate for aspen-dominated stands in the boreal mixed wood to minimize ecological disturbance while maintaining aesthetics within a park setting.																			0008-4271					FEB	1998	78	1					59	68		10.4141/S97-027	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S97-027													WOS:000073319700008
J	Guan, RZ				Guan, RZ			Abundance and production of the introduced signal crayfish in a British lowland river	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												In 1984, 40 mature and 100 immature signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana), were introduced into the River Great Ouse, England. By 1994, the population had spread up and down stream to occupy an 11.4 ion river section. The estimated density and biomass (wet weight) of the population in 1993 were highest in summer at 4.0 m(-2) and 133 g m(-2) respectively, with annual means of 2.2 m(-2) and 82 g m(-2) for crayfish of 230 mm carapace length (CL) in the pool (P2) where the crayfish were originally introduced. Density and biomass were 15 m(-2) and 78 g m(-2), with annual means of 6.1 m(-2) and 33 g m(-2) for crayfish of all sizes in a riffle 300 m downstream from P2. An annual survival rate of 14% was estimated for crayfish >30 mm CL in P2 in 1993. The relative abundance estimated for six riffles and six pools in 1994 showed that crayfish abundance decreased gradually from the original site of introduction both up and down the river. Estimated annual production of crayfish >35 mm CL in P2 for 1993 was 52.58 g m(-2) WW, with a turnover ratio (production/biomass) of 0.44.																			0967-6120	1573-143X					2000	8	1					59	76		10.1023/A:1009272916339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009272916339													WOS:000089753900006
J	Deutsch, ES; Alameddine, I				Deutsch, Eliza S.; Alameddine, Ibrahim			Hindcasting eutrophication and changes in temperature and storage volume in a semi-arid reservoir: a multi-decadal Landsat-based assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In situ monitoring of freshwater systems is often constrained by cost and accessibility, particularly in developing countries and in remote areas. Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 degrees C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems.

The relative significance of environmental and anthropogenic factors affecting zooplankton community structure in Southeast Wisconsin Till Plain lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Zooplankton community composition can be related to natural environmental factors such as lake morphology, lake landscape position, and water chemistry as well as anthropogenic factors such as agricultural and urban land-use. We hypothesized that within-lake factors, such as water chemistry, lake morphology, and human land-use would each be related to zooplankton community structure, but that watershed land-use would be the strongest correlate in southeast Wisconsin lakes. Zooplankton samples, collected every 3 months over a year, from 29 lakes were used to determine how lake and watershed morphology, water quality, and land-use were related to zooplankton community structure in the heavily developed Southeast Wisconsin Till Plain Ecoregion. Forward selection and a variation partitioning procedure were used to determine relative and shared contributions of each suite of variables in predicting zooplankton community structure. Redundancy analysis was used to characterize dominant gradients in pelagic zooplankton communities and related environmental factors and land-use. The major correlates of community structure included summer phosphorus, lake depth and surface area and urban and natural land. Variation partitioning illustrated that phosphorus alone accounts for the greatest part (12%) of community structure. Urban land-uses (residential, commercial and paved land) and lake morphology partially explain zooplankton community variation through combined effects with phosphorus. Small cladocerans and Skistodiaptomus pallidus were associated with higher phosphorus, shallow depth and higher urban land-use, while Daphnia pulicaria dominates in deep lakes with lower phosphorus and less urban land-use. This study contributes to the understanding of factors affecting zooplankton community structure in a largely human developed region and illustrates the importance of eutrophication in structuring zooplankton community composition.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2011	668	1					137	146		10.1007/s10750-011-0636-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0636-1													WOS:000290177300010
J	Havens, KE				Havens, KE			Unique structural properties of pelagic food webs	OIKOS												Two large food web data sets, each characterized by comprehensive sampling and high taxonomic resolution, display major differences in their structural properties. In 60 food webs compiled by Sugihara et al., representing such diverse habitats as springs, creeks, rotting logs, treeholes, and forest canopies, there is no significant increase in web complexity (SC) with species number (S), and predator/prey (PP) ratios average 2.2. The fractions of top (TF), intermediate (IF) and basal (BF) species average 0.47, 0.35, and 0.18, respectively. Along a gradient of increasing S, IF increases and BF declines. Maximal food chain length (MAX) also increases with S in the Sugihara webs, and averages 2.7. In 50 food webs compiled by Havens, representing the pelagic communities of small lakes, SC increases rapidly with S, and PP averages only 0.6. Species fractions average 0.06 (TF), 0.44 (IF), and 0.50 (BF), and only IF is significantly correlated with S. MAX increases more rapidly with S than in the Sugihara webs, and it averages 4.7. Distinct properties of pelagic food webs, including high SC that increases rapidly with S, low PP, and high BF, are evidenced by the results of other studies, and may be due to (1) the predominance of filter-feeding predators that consume numerous prey taxa; and (2) to the very high diversity of small particulate autotrophic prey species found in pelagic communities.																			0030-1299					FEB	1997	78	1					75	80		10.2307/3545802	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545802													WOS:A1997WJ10900009
J	White, A; Mueller, D; Copland, L				White, Adrienne; Mueller, Derek; Copland, Luke			Reconstructing hydrographic change in Petersen Bay, Ellesmere Island, Canada, inferred from SAR imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery was used to reconstruct the change in limnological conditions adjacent to an Arctic ice shelf by examining the backscatter values of coastal ice in mid-winter scenes. High SAR backscatter values (>-6 dB) suggest that an ice-dammed lake was present adjacent to the south coast of Petersen Bay from 1992 until 2005. Following a large calving event of the adjacent Petersen Ice Shelf (-8.07 km(2)) in August 2005, the lake drained through a region where the ice shelf had separated from the coastline. This loss of freshwater and replacement of lake ice with sea ice along the southern coast of Petersen Bay were confirmed from analyses of ice core samples and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles. The exception to this pattern was one distinct area where terrestrial streams entered the edge of Petersen Bay and freshwater continued to collect from 2006 to 2008. However, this ephemeral area of freshwater has not reformed since 2009 due to the persistence of open water events in Petersen Bay (observed in optical satellite imagery), which likely facilitated mixing of freshwater with sea water. Based on the continued break-ups of Petersen Ice Shelf and the frequency of open water events, it is unlikely that this ice-dammed lake will reform. The results of this study underscore the utility of SAR for reconstructing past hydrographic conditions in the water column below. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Survival and Spatial Ecology of the Snapping Turtle, Chelydra serpentina, on the Upper Mississippi River	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												We studied the survival and spatial ecology of adult Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina) on Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) during 1997-2001. We captured 597 Snapping Turtles 745 times (333 adult males; 238 adult females; and 26 juveniles) at two study sites; Goose Island, Wisconsin and Lawrence Lake, Minnesota.

Annual survival ranged from 0.857 to 1.000 and averaged 0.944 with Goose Island and Lawrence Lake estimates pooled. Legal harvest was the most important cause of mortality and accounted for 57% of documented deaths. Annual home range size using the Poly-Buff (PB) method averaged 11.13 ha and ranged from 2.20 ha to 37.18 ha. Emergent and rooted-floating aquatic vegetation were used disproportionally more than their availability and 72% of all locations collected during the active period occurred within these habitat types. Overall, radio-marked Snapping Turtles selected hibernacula in the following habitat categories; marshes (38%), main/side channels (28%), backwater sloughs and small ponds (14%), spring areas (10%), small tributary streams (7%), and tertiary channels (3%). Developing conservative, consistent harvest regulations among the states that border the UMR should be a management priority.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	2009	123	4					329	337		10.22621/cfn.v123i4.1002	http://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v123i4.1002													WOS:000207911800006

Chironomids record terrestrial temperature changes throughout Arctic interglacials of the past 200,000 yr	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Quaternary interglacial periods provide glimpses of a warmer Arctic and useful perspectives on possible future conditions, but records of Arctic terrestrial conditions over multiple interglacial periods are rare. Here, we take advantage of a site in the Canadian Arctic where lacustrine sediments representing the past three interglacial periods are preserved in an extant lake. We use subfossil insects (chironomids) preserved in this exceptional sedimentary archive to derive temperature reconstructions through the Holocene up to A. D. 2005, through the Last Interglacial sensu stricto (marine isotope stage or MIS 5e), and a portion of the penultimate interglacial (MIS 7). Chironomid-inferred temperatures are warmest for the early Holocene and MIS 5e, two periods with enhanced Northern Hemisphere insolation forcing relative to today. Twentieth-century warming at this site apparently caused the recent extirpation of cold stenothermous chironomid taxa. Assemblages from MIS 5e have close analogs in modern training set data as determined by squared-chord distance, and MIS 5e species assemblages are very similar to Holocene assemblages at this site. MIS 7 sediments record summer temperatures similar to those of the mid-to late Holocene, followed by a descent into glacial conditions. Even MIS 7 chironomid assemblages, dating back similar to 200,000 yr, have close modern analogs. These lake sediments also provide direct evidence for a period of regional deglaciation between MIS 5e and the Holocene (most likely MIS 5a). To our knowledge, the data presented here represent the longest paleotemperature record thus far generated using chironomids. The existence of close modern analogs for ancient chironomid assemblages at Lake CF8 suggests that this method can provide useful paleotemperature estimates extending back hundreds of millennia.

Satellite instruments view volcanic thermal features across the globe at various temporal and spatial resolutions. Thermal features that may be a precursor to a major eruption, or indicative of important changes in an on-going eruption can be subtle, making them challenging to reliably identify with satellite instruments. The goal of this study was to explore the limits of the types and magnitudes of thermal anomalies that could be detected using satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data. Specifically, the characterization of sub-pixel thermal features with a wide range of temperatures is considered using ASTER multispectral TIR data. First, theoretical calculations were made to define a "thermal mixing detection threshold" for ASTER, which quantifies the limits of ASTER's ability to resolve sub-pixel thermal mixing over a range of hot target temperatures and % pixel areas. Then, ASTER TIR data were used to model sub-pixel thermal features at the Yellowstone National Park geothermal area (hot spring pools with temperatures from 40 to 90 degrees C) and at Mount Erebus Volcano, Antarctica (an active lava lake with temperatures from 200 to 800 degrees C). Finally, various sources of uncertainty in sub-pixel thermal calculations were quantified for these empirical measurements, including pixel resampling, atmospheric correction, and background temperature and emissivity assumptions.

The nature and origin of magnetic anomalies over the Golcuk caldera, Isparta, South-Western Turkey	GEOFIZICHESKIY ZHURNAL-GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL												For the first time, ground magnetic survey was performed which data were inverted by means of total horizontal derivative, horizontal gradient analytic signal, and hyperbolic tilt angle techniques to identify subsurface volcanic structures around Isparta city (South-Western Turkey). Here, Golcuk volcanism took place at the apex of the Isparta Angle at the intersection of the Lycian and Antalya nappes. It initiated between 4.0-4.7 my ago mainly as lava extrusions and ended with phreatoplinian eruptions during Quaternary time. The study area is covered by authochtonous and allochthonous units that are intruded by Pliocene and Quaternary Golcuk volcanics and also overlain by pyroclastic fall and flow deposits. The boundaries were revealed for the buried volcanic structure from the edge detection methods. The geometry of the trachytic dome southwestern of the Golcuk Lake and its downward continuation were studied by 2D modelling with the control of the power spectrum depth results applied to the focused anomaly. The azimuthally-averaged logarithmic power spectra plot indicates that the downward continuation of source depth of the trachytic dome reaches up to 850 m. The forward inversion results indicate that the horizontal size of the model for this trachytic dome is 1250 m beneath the surface while it's surface extension is only about 400 m.					elitok, ömer/HHD-1292-2022; erbek-kiran, ezgi/AGA-4342-2022; DOLMAZ, Mustafa/AAA-9130-2021; Tutunsatar, Hatice Evrim/ACO-8245-2022; Oksum, Erdinc/AAA-9563-2021; TUTUNSATAR, HATICE EVRIM/ACO-8245-2022	TUTUNSATAR, HATICE EVRIM/0000-0002-0712-3164													0203-3100	2524-1052					2018	40	3					145	156		10.24028/gzh.0203-3100.v40i3.2018.137191	http://dx.doi.org/10.24028/gzh.0203-3100.v40i3.2018.137191													WOS:000439918300007
S	Yechieli, Y		Enzel, Y; Agnon, A; Stein, M		Yechieli, Yoseph			Response of the groundwater system to changes in the Dead Sea level	NEW FRONTIERS IN DEAD SEA PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The Dead Sea is an extremely dynamic hydrologic system, where the base level is currently declining at a rate of similar to 1 m/yr. The groundwater level follows this drop within a relatively short time (a few days in the case of the extensive floods in the winter of 1991-1992). The fresh-saline water interface is very shallow, compared to that of the ocean, due to the large density difference between the fresh and saline water bodies. The interface was found to be steeper near the marginal faults, tracked in a time domain electromagnetic geophysical survey, due to the relatively low horizontal hydraulic conductivity at the fault zone. SUTRA code simulations support this result. Near the shoreline of the Dead Sea, a new coastal area is exposed, whereby the main processes are flushing of most of the section and evaporation and precipitation of salts near the surface. The effect of flushing is seen in several in situ profiles that show much lower concentrations than the original Dead Sea brine, which existed only a few decades ago. Preliminary simulations on a larger scale imply that the Dead Sea water level drop will influence groundwater levels at least several kilometers from the shoreline, increasing the hydraulic gradient and thus also the discharge to the Dead Sea.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2401-0				2006	401						113	126		10.1130/2006.2401(07)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2006.2401(07)													WOS:000271639300008

Airborne gravity over Lake Vostok and adjacent highlands of East Antarctica	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												[ 1] Lake Vostok and a 1200 km transect were the targets of aerogeophysical surveys in East Antarctica during the austral summer of 2000/2001. The measurement of gravity anomalies for geologic studies was the primary goal. A total of 24,459 line-km of data were acquired. Favorable weather, aircraft navigation, and instrument performance contributed to excellent data quality. Multiple carrier-phase GPS solutions to determine aircraft-induced accelerations were available for each flight. Raw gravity and GPS position solutions were initially filtered to compensate for hardware filtering within the gravity meter. Filtering of remaining high-frequency noise was accomplished with a spatial, moving average smoother. Due to upward continuation effects imposed by the ice cover, the theoretically estimated minimum resolvable gravity feature size for the Lake Vostok survey is 8 km, consistent with an analysis of power spectra comparing the gravity signal to noise calculated from geographically repeated lines. Comparison of gravity results with subice topography indicates that the gravity data are sensitive to real features including the existence of major crustal structures. Repeated lines and crossovers were analyzed to estimate uncertainties for the Lake Vostok data set, with both of these repeatability measures indicating relative accuracy in the 2 mGal range for the unleveled data and 1 mGal after leveling.

J	WALKER, WW				WALKER, WW			USE OF HYPOLIMNETIC OXYGEN DEPLETION RATE AS A TROPHIC STATE INDEX FOR LAKES	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The feasibility of lake water quality management planning has greatly increased over the past 10 yr with the development of relatively simple, empirical methods for assessing eutrophication problems. These relate P loading, hydrology and morphometry to such traditional trophic state indices as P concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration and transparency. One difficulty associated with use of these methods is that water quality criteria, as related to beneficial use, do not generally correspond to subjective definitions of trophic state. An attempt to improve on existing methods by relating measures of P, chlorophyll-a and/or transparency to hypolimnetic dissolved O2, which is of direct relevance to existing water quality standards, particularly for fisheries management is discussed. A modified version of Carlson''s (1977) trophic state index summarizes relationships among summer, epilimnetic measurements of total P chlorophyll-a and transparency. Based on data from 30 lakes this index is highly correlated with areal hypolimnetic O2 depletion rate when the apparent effects of mean depth are also taken into account (R2 = 0.91). Tests of the empirical model on a separate data base of 86 lakes indicate that the approach can be used to predict O2 status based on lake morphometry and trophic index. The methodology provides a link between P mass balance models and existing water quality criteria for dissolved O2.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1979	15	6					1463	1470		10.1029/WR015i006p01463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR015i006p01463													WOS:A1979JC38700021

Observed seasonal trends of diatom-derived C20 highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs): implications for paleoclimate studies	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The hydrogen isotopic composition of lake water (delta 2Hlw) contains hydrologic information and can be used as a recorder of lake water hydrology, including the extent of evaporation of the lake system. Initial studies indicate that the hydrogen isotopes of highly branched isoprenoids (delta 2HHBI), synthesized by lake diatoms and preserved in lake sediments are a promising proxy for constraining past delta 2Hlw values that are free from terrestrial influences. However, there are many aspects of this proxy, including the seasonality of HBI production, that are unknown and need to be addressed more fully before the proxy can by widely applied. To determine when HBIs are produced throughout the year, and whether there are seasonal biases in delta 2Hlw reconstructions, we deployed two sediment traps at Brown's Lake, in northeastern Ohio. We present HBI concentrations, delta 2HHBI values, HBI carbon isotopes and bulk sediment carbon isotopes from sediment traps collected monthly for 26 months to investigate seasonality of HBIs. We observed HBIs in each of the monthly sediment traps throughout the study interval with an increase in HBI concentration during September and October, suggesting that HBIs are made throughout the year with greater production during fall. We calculated the difference between delta 2HHBI and delta 2Hlw values (epsilon 2HHBI/lw) and observe a range in epsilon 2HHBI/lw values of up to 64 parts per thousand, which we speculate is related to changes in the diatom communities that synthesize HBIs throughout the year and between different years. Different diatom communities may have different biosynthetic pathways or metabolisms that result in isotope effects. This study is the first that examines the seasonality of HBIs in lake sediments and provides framework for interpreting the seasonality of hydroclimate records generated from delta 2HHBI values in temperate eutrophic lakes.																			0016-7037	1872-9533				OCT 15	2025	407						211	223		10.1016/j.gca.2025.09.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2025.09.017													WOS:001577462300001
J	Yuan, S; Jiang, CB; Ma, Y; Li, SS				Yuan, Shuai; Jiang, Changbo; Ma, Yuan; Li, Shanshan			Spatial Heterogeneity and Temporal Variation of Water Levels in Dongting Lake	SUSTAINABILITY												To quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of the water-level variations in the study area, we conducted cluster analysis of the temporally varying measurements across multiple hydrological stations. The temporal trends and change points were analyzed, followed by IHA-RVA quantification of the water-level alterations before and after change points. Cluster analysis demonstrated the following. (1) Hydrological stations segregate into two distinct groups at the Euclidean distance threshold d = 5, and into three clusters at d = 4, confirming the pronounced west-east heterogeneity in the lake. (2) The hydrological alteration degrees exhibit considerable variation across the lake's sub-lakes (Qili, Muping, South Dongting, East Dongting), with marked heterogeneity persisting even among representative monitoring stations within individual sub-lakes. The water-level regimes in Qili Lake can be partitioned into two distinct periods, before and after the change point, exhibiting the highest hydrological alteration degree across the lake. Representative stations of the other sub-lakes fall into three periods. During the first phase of hydrological alteration, Zhouwenmiao, Jinshi, and Chenglingji exhibit moderate alteration. Throughout the second alteration phase, all the representative stations consistently exhibit moderate alteration, although significant heterogeneity emerges across hydrological indicators among the sub-lakes. (3) Downstream of Yangliutan station, the longitudinal profile exhibits terraced morphology, segmented into three distinct levels by two hydraulic knickpoints. This geomorphic configuration primarily controls both the localized stage reductions and the maintenance of elevated upstream water levels during dry seasons. Confronting the persistent dry-season stage declines at Yingtian Station, enhanced monitoring and conservation of terraced transition zones in South Dongting Lake must be prioritized, with implementation of the zoned control principle for water-level governance and lake management. This study establishes a scientific foundation for the protection and governance of Dongting Lake, thereby advancing sustainable utilization of its water resources.																				2071-1050				SEP 8	2025	17	17							8080	10.3390/su17178080	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17178080													WOS:001570027600001

Despite the significant environmental effects of meltwater, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the historical changes in meltwater. The key is to obtain reliable quantitative records of meltwater changes. Here, we present Holocene delta Dwax records from a loess and a peatland on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, documenting the hydrogen isotopic composition of the regional summer precipitation and surface water affected by meltwater respectively. The two records together reveal substantially increased meltwater during the middle to late Holocene transition, lasting for approximately 1500 years. The meltwater event coincides with a series of exceptional warmth during 5-3 ka across the midlatitude inland Asia, suggesting that the regional warming was the primary driver of the increased meltwater. This meltwater event had a considerable influence on regional ecology, leading to dramatic fluctuations in algal and bacterial populations and biomass. In addition, this meltwater event may have occurred over a larger area of glaciers and permafrost, where the water isotope records during 5 ka and 3 ka differ from low-latitude regions. This meltwater event, as a crucial aspect of the climatic changes during the middle to late Holocene transition in inland Asia, its driving mechanism and environmental impacts warrant further investigation.

Presumably, internal waves (IWs) make a significant contribution to the heat transfer in the water column. However, the mechanisms of mixing enhancement by generation, interaction, and breaking of IWs of different scales, especially short-wavelength ones, have not been sufficiently studied. Furthermore, the experimental data required for estimating the key parameters of IWs (wavelengths, propagation velocities) are rather fragmentary, which makes it difficult to quantify the turbulent transfer caused by IWs. This paper presents the estimates of these IW parameters based on data obtained in the winter months of 2014 and 2016 in a small boreal ice-covered lake. Having analyzed horizontally spaced thermistor chain data, we managed to detect the presence of short standing and propagating IWs, and to estimate their length (from several meters to several tens of meters) and phase and group velocities (from several mm/s to several tens of mm/s). Also, their vertical mode structure was detected. It was shown that IW generation events were characterized by a high degree of spatial localization, and the IW energy was unevenly distributed through the water column.

J	Simcic, T				Simcic, T			The role of plankton, zoobenthos, and sediment in organic matter degradation in oligotrophic and eutrophic mountain lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Intensity of organic matter degradation, assessed by the respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity, was studied in microplankton, zooplankton, chironomid larvae as the dominant group of the macrobenthos, and sediment in mountain lakes of different trophic levels in summer months. The highest ETS activities per unit of surface were observed in sediments. Significantly lower activities were observed in microplankton, and lower still in zooplankton, and chironomids. The total ETS activity m(-2) was higher in eutrophic lakes (Jezero na Planini pri Jezeru and Krnsko jezero) than in oligotrophic ones (Zgornje Krisko jezero, Spodnje Krisko jezero, Jezero v Ledvicah). The contributions of communities investigated to total ETS activity m-2 differed between lakes of different trophic level. Estimation of respiratory carbon loss through different components revealed that the most of the organic matter was oxidized in sediments of mountain lakes. The respiratory carbon losses were higher through zooplankton than through microplankton in all lakes. Carbon losses through plankton components and sediments were significantly lower in oligotrophic than in eutrophic lakes. The contribution of respiratory carbon loss through chironomids to total carbon loss m-2 was higher in oligotrophic than in eutrophic lakes. Therefore, it seems that contributions of microplankton and zooplankton to mineralization processes increase, and contributions of chironomids and sediment surface decrease with increasing trophic level of the lakes.

Calcified structures and data from 860 lake trout were collected from 1972 to 1987. The population was characterized by the regular cyclic occurrence of strong year classes, which were probably an effect of pulse angling, cyclic food abundance, and possibly intraspecific interaction. The majority (65.8%) of the lake trout caught in the exceptional winter fishery of 1980 (3.3 kg.ha-1) were in the lake prior to liming in 1975-76. Young lake trout (up to age 4) of the 1 975 and 1976 year classes grew bigger and had larger scales than other year classes from 1973 to 1977, coinciding with an increase in hypolimnetic zooplankton, probably related to improved water quality. Otoliths grew significantly larger and more translucent and exceeded relative growth of scales and body for all ages in 1976 (18% greater) and for the 1 976 year class, confirming that otolith accretion can come from the ambient water because liming increased the calcium content by 33% that year, the only observed direct effect of the treatment.

Generally speaking, underwater acoustic channel will represent doubly spread, i.e. multipath spread and Doppler spread. Also the multipath spread will be quite long in the underwater acoustic channel. For example, the multipath spread will be several milliseconds in the shallow sea and several seconds in the deep sea. Multipath spread will lead to Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), and Doppler spread will cause the channel to be rapidly time-varying. Although ISI can be suppressed by channel equalizer, but because of the long multipath spread, it increases the complexity about the design of the equalizer. In this paper, channel shortening will be used to reduce the ISI. We present two methods of channel shorting, which are Time Reversal (TR) filter and the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) filter. When the two filters are used in FH-FSK, we found that the performance of MMSE filter is better than TR filter. Taking into account the characteristics of sparse underwater acoustic channel, Compressive Sensing (CS) algorithm is used for channel estimation. Finally, We perform a series of numerical simulations and the experiments on the lake to show that MMSE filter outperformances the TR filter under the FH-FSK system using the bit error rate (BER) as an evaluation criterion.					董, 继刚/KBD-4022-2024; Frank, Viki/GXZ-9902-2022														1660-9336		978-3-03835-017-0				2014	511-512						334	341		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.511-512.334	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.511-512.334													WOS:000348897400070

New records of California serogroup viruses in Aedes mosquitoes and first detection in simulioidae flies from Northern Canada and Alaska	POLAR BIOLOGY												An expected consequence of climate warming is an expansion of the geographical distribution of biting insects and associated arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Emerging and re-emerging arboviruses that can affect human and animal health are likely to pose significant consequences for Northern communities where access to health resources is limited. In the North American Arctic, little is known about arboviruses. Thus, in 2019, we sampled biting insects in Nunavik, Northern Quebec (Kuujjuaq), Nunavut (Igloolik, Karrak Lake and Cambridge Bay), Northwest Territories (Igloolik and Yellowknife) and Alaska (Fairbanks). The main objective was to detect the presence of California serogroup (CSG) viruses- a widespread group of arboviruses across North America and that are known to cause a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild febrile illness to fatal encephalitis. Biting insects were captured twice daily for a 7-day period in mid-summer, using a standardised protocol consisting of 100 figure-eight movements of a sweep net. Captured specimens were separated by genus (mosquitoes) or by superfamily (other insects) and then grouped into pools of 75 by geographical locations. In total, 5079 Aedes mosquitoes and 1014 Simulioidae flies were caught. We report the detection of CSG viruses RNA in mosquitoes captured in Nunavut (Karrak Lake) and Nunavik (Kuujjuaq). We also report, for the first time in North America, the presence of CSG viruses RNA in Simulioidae flies. These results highlight the use of biting insects for tracking any future emergence of arboviruses in the North, thereby providing key information for public health in Northern communities.

Mitochondrial DNA fragment sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA were combined and used to elucidate the population structure and historical demography of oriental river prawn in Taiwan. A total of 202 individuals from six reservoirs and three estuaries were separately collected. Nucleotide diversity (pi) of all populations was 0.01217, with values ranging from 0.00188 (Shihmen Reservoir, SMR, northern Taiwan) to 0.01425 (Mingte Reservoir, MTR, west-central Taiwan). All 76 haplotypes were divided into 2 lineages: lineage A included individuals from all sampling areas except SMR, and lineage B included specimens from all sampling locations except Chengching Lake Reservoir (CLR) and Liyu Lake Reservoir (LLR). All F-ST values among nine populations were significantly different except the one between Jhonggang River Estuary (JGE, west-central Taiwan) and Kaoping River Estuary (KPE, southern Taiwan). UPGMA tree of nine populations showed two main groups: the first group included the SMR and Tamsui River Estuary (TSE) (both located northern Taiwan), and the second one included the other seven populations (west-central, southern and eastern Taiwan). Demographic analyses implied a population expansion occurred during the recent history of the species. The dispersal route of this species might be from China to west-central and west-southern Taiwan, and then the part individuals belonging to lineage A and B dispersed southerly and northerly, respectively. And then part individuals in west-central Taiwan fell back to and stay at estuaries as the sea level rose about 18,000 years ago.

J	Lu, JB; Zhu, L; Hu, GL; Wu, JG				Lu, Jianbo; Zhu, Lei; Hu, Guoliang; Wu, Jianguo			Integrating animal manure-based bioenergy production with invasive species control: A case study at Tongren Pig Farm in China	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												Integrated approach and bioresource engineering are often required to deal with multiple and interactive environmental problems for sustainable development at local and regional scales. Pig farming has flourished with fast growing economy and increasing human demands for meat in China. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), a noxious invasive species, has encroached into most of the local rivers and lakes. Both the wastes from the booming pig farms as well as the massive plant materials of water hyacinth have caused a range of serious ecological and environmental problems. Here we present an integrated sustainable, ecological and experimental study that was designed to deal with these two problems simultaneously. Our experimental results showed that the mixtures of water hyacinth with pig manure consistently had much higher biogas production than pig manure alone, and that the highest biogas production was achieved when 15% of the fermentation substrates were water hyacinth. Our analysis further revealed that the changing C/N ratio and the lignin content in the fermentation feedstock due to the addition of water hyacinth might be two important factors affecting the biogas production. We also found that the solar-powered water-heating unit significantly increased the biogas production (especially in winter time). Overall, the project proved to be successful ecologically and socially. Through such an integrated approach and bioresource engineering, wastes are treated, energy is harvested, and the environment is protected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	WHITE, E; PAYNE, G				WHITE, E; PAYNE, G			DISTRIBUTION AND BIOLOGICAL AVAILABILITY OF REACTIVE HIGH MOLECULAR-WEIGHT PHOSPHORUS IN NATURAL-WATERS IN NEW-ZEALAND	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Eutrophic lakes and many streams on the central volcanic plateau of the North Island, New Zealand, contain dissolved chemically reactive P which is not orthophosphate. Sephadex gel (G25-150) chromatograms reveal that one reactive component is of high molecular weight (MW > 5000) while a 2nd component elutes in the same way as PO4-P. The reactive high MW P (RHMW-P) in streams generally forms only a small proportion of the dissolved reactive P (DRP). In some eutrophic lakes the proportion of RHMW-P in the DRP is high (70-80%). Each lake may have a characteristic distribution of the 2 forms of reactive P. In summer where DRP concentrations are low (< 2 mg .cntdot. m-3) in lake surface waters, PO4-P seems to dominate over RHMW-P which is consistent with long 32PO4 turnover times which are found in many of the central volcanic plateau lakes. Algal growth responses to P uptake were similar for PO4-P and RHMW-P, but not all of the RHMW-P was taken up by Chlorella in bioassays. The proportion of the RHMW-P taken up by Chlorella was different for each lake examined, posing problems in relating DRP concentrations to algal growth responses in lakes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	4					664	669		10.1139/f80-083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-083													WOS:A1980JM56600013

Forests protect aquatic communities from detrimental impact by volcanic deposits in the tropical Andes (Ecuador)	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Volcanic activity impacts ecosystems sometimes with multiple, complex and long-lasting consequences, including volcanic tephra (airborne material) causing widespread disruptions. We study the effects of tephra deposition around two tropical lakes of Ecuador using a multi-proxy analysis of lake sediment archives spanning the last 2000 years. We present the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation (pollen), aquatic macroinvertebrate fauna (chironomids) and organic matter (stable isotopes) in: (i) a high elevation, stream-connected, open alpine grassland (Andean paramo) and (ii) a mid-elevation, stream-isolated, pre-montane forest. Paramo vegetation showed a slight increase in herbs and quick recovery after the tephra deposition; however, the aquatic community suffered a regime shift not reversed today c. 1500 years after the event. In the pre-montane location, the canopy opened up following tephra deposition, and it took c. 150 years to return to pre-impact levels. At the forested site, no major changes in the aquatic fauna were observed related to the tephra deposition. We hypothesise that the forest acted as a protective barrier preventing a large fallout of ash into the aquatic system. Forest not only acted as a buffer for ash falling into the water from the air, but also prevented landslides of tephra by enhancing soil stability, contrary to what was observed in the open system. We demonstrate the protective ecosystem service that forests play in sustaining ecological resilience and water quality facing natural (volcanic) disturbance. The ongoing deforestation of tropical regions therefore might increase the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems, threatening the water quality for ecosystems and human populations.

J	Evans, TM				Evans, Thomas M.			Are lampreys homebodies? Studying ammocoetes with open population models	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Larval lampreys (ammocoetes) are assumed to be sedentary and have restricted movements, but their movement is still poorly understood. Using elastomer implants, ammocoetes of two different species of lampreys (Lethenteron appendix and Petromyzon marinus) in two streams were tagged with permanent, unique marks (N=1035) and resampled once a month from June 2014 until October 2014. Some individuals were recaptured during every sampling event (N=3, 0.3%). However, most animals were never recaptured after being tagged (N=700, 67%) or were captured only once (N=213, 21%). The apparent survival (phi) varied in response to time and grouping variables at both sites (0.25-0.86), but the probability of capture (P) did not vary as much (0.41-0.85). Differences were detected between sites, with phi being higher for L.appendix at Dyke Creek, a Genesee River tributary. Whether differences were caused by site-specific details or species differences is unclear. At Dyke Creek, where age could be partially established from length-frequency histograms, phi was higher for 1year old than for older animals. At Oquaga Creek (where P.marinus were captured), phi was highly variable (0.11-0.72) and was lowest in the fall sampling (September-October). The P was similar at both sites (0.5-0.6) and across times and groups, even when it was significant to the model. Understanding the movement of ammocoetes will help conserve and control lampreys.					; Evans, Thomas/I-2446-2019	Evans, Thomas/0000-0001-6717-4521; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2017	26	2					168	180		10.1111/eff.12261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12261													WOS:000395645400001

Impact of forest harvesting on water quality and fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes in summer	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Forestry activities in the Canadian Boreal region have increased in the last decades, raising concerns about their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. Water quality and fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were measured over a 3-year period in eight eastern Boreal Shield lakes: four lakes were studied before, 1 and 2 years after forest harvesting (perturbed lakes) and compared with four undisturbed reference lakes (unperturbed lakes) sampled at the same time. ANOVAs showed a significant increase in total phosphorus (TP) in perturbed lakes when the three sampling dates were considered and in DOC concentrations when considering 1 year before and 1 year after the perturbation only. At 1 year post-clear cutting DOC concentrations were about 15% greater in the perturbed lakes at similar to 15 mgC L-1 compared to 12.5 mgC L-1 in the unperturbed lakes. In contrast, absorbance and fluorescence measurements showed that all metrics remained within narrow ranges compared to the range observed in natural waters, indicating that forest harvesting did not affect the nature of DOM characterized with spectroscopic techniques. These results confirm an impact of forestry activities 1 year after the perturbation. However, this effect seems to be mitigated 2 years after, indicating that the system shows high resilience and may be able to return to its original condition in terms of water quality parameters assessed in this study.					; Gagné, Jean-Pierre/AAE-6988-2019	Archambault, Philippe/0000-0001-5986-6149; Gagne, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1783-862X; Sirois, Pascal/0000-0003-1272-5730													1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	23					6999	7011		10.5194/bg-12-6999-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-6999-2015													WOS:000365901800011

However, limited information on the ecological significance of bacterial community during algae blooms of rivers has been given, more studies should be focused on the bacterial diversity and distribution characteristics in eutrophic rivers. In this study, we explored the spatial variations of bacterial biomass, community structure, and their relationship with environmental factors in the eutrophic Xiangxi River. The content of Chlorophyll (Chl) was about 16 mg/L in the midstream (S2, S3), which was in the range of light eutrophication. Significant spatial variation of bacterial community structure was found at different sites and depths (p < 0.05), and the driving environmental factor was found to be nitrogen, mainly detected as total nitrogen (TN), Kjeldahl nitrogen (KN), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) (p < 0.05). The midstream sites had some significantly different bacteria, including algicidal bacteria and dominant lineages during algal blooms. This result was consistent with the functional prediction, where significant higher abundance of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways was associated with algicidal substances in the midstream. At different water depths, some populations adapted to the surface layer, such as the class Flavobacteriia, and others preferred to inhabit in the bottom layer, such as Betaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The bacterial biomass was higher in the bottom layer than that in the surface and middle layer, and temperature and pH were found to be the major driving factors. The bacterial diversity increased with the increasing of depths in most sampling sites according to operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1 and ACE indexes, and PO43- was demonstrated to be the most significant factor. In summary, this study offered the evidence for microbial distribution characteristics across different sites and depths in summer, and its relationship with environmental variables in a eutrophic river.

Since that time, lake level. has been rising at an exponentially decreasing rate in the western portion of the basin as a result of postglacial and neotectonic uplift of the outlet near Kingston, at the eastern end. The published lake level history has been combined with other less well-known parameters (the post-Iroquois regional topography, erosion-deposition rates, and distribution of resistive shore materials) to reconstruct the evolution of the western Lake Ontario shoreline. Borehole, long piston core, and other subsurface data sources, primarily from the western portion of the lake near Hamilton Harbour, provide most of the physical constraints. Time references were provided by radiocarbon dates on shallow-water organics in the subsurface sediments. A computer program was designed to calculate and contour the changing elevations of the rebounding post-Iroquois topographic surface, allowing the time-dependent water-plane elevation to be superimposed. Semiquantitative allowance was made for differential erosion and deposition along the advancing shoreline. The reconstruction provides a perspective on past and future shoreline evolution in the basin and possibly on the location of potentially commercial offshore deposits of aggregate.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				NOV	1994	31	11					1618	1629		10.1139/e94-143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e94-143													WOS:A1994PY65900004
J	Demchenko, N; Chubarenko, I				Demchenko, Natalia; Chubarenko, Irina			Horizontal exchange across the thermal bar front: laboratory and numerical modelling	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												Laboratory and numerical experiments have revealed physical reasons for the permeability of the thermal bar to horizontal transport. The thermal bar is understood as a front associated with the temperature of maximum density (T-m = 3.98 degrees C for fresh water). Laboratory experiments were performed in a 2-metre-long non-rotating channel with a sloping bottom, filled with water with T < T-m and naturally heated from above. Analysis of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) images revealed water dynamics in the presence of T-m. It was revealed that the compensating flow in intermediate layers is responsible for the horizontal exchange across the thermal bar front. We applied a 3D non-hydrostatic MIKE3-FlowModel (www.dhi.dk) to investigate the permeability of the spring thermal bar in basins on the scale of lakes and a laboratory flume. We performed an analysis of the concentration distribution of 12 passive tracers released at different locations in the flow domain. Scaling analysis, corroborated by the results of laboratory and numerical experiments, predicts the discharge across the thermal bar as Q 0.1[g x Delta rho/rho 0](1/2)h(3/2), where h is the depth of the upper thermo-active layer, rho 0 is a maximum density and Delta rho is a characteristic horizontal density difference. A combined analysis of data shows that this law is obeyed.

WG5.11				Lake Orta, in northern Italy, has been acid since the 1960's. Lake Orta is a deep and large lake. The average pH in 1988 was 4.5 units. As a remedial action, about 15,000 t of calcium carbonate were added between May 1989 and June 1990. The average pH of the lake increased to 5.52 units in 1991. Given the volume of the lake, this is a large increase. A computer generated animation visualizes the change in lake water pH during, and after the treatment. A colour scale quantifies observed pH values. Data were collected monthly at eight stations, from the water surface to the bottom. Each animation frame is updated daily. The visualization of over 30,000 data shows that some lime left the lake through the Nigoglia River during the summer months and that liming operations in a large and deep lake have a larger effect in periods of full circulation rather than during periods of thermal stratification.

The artifactual samples come from different archaeological contexts of altitudinal sectors of the steppe (Coast -wintering fields, <= 400 m asl-, Intermediate Pampas and Tobiano Plateau >= 900 m asl) related to Late Holocene chronologies. The higher frequencies of flintknapping and discard evidences, in addition to the integrity of the samples, the artifactual composition, and the high availability of basalt nodules of dimensions and qualities suitable for flintknapping, show the manufacture and immediate use of blades within the framework of expedient strategies in residential spaces of the coast. The efficiency of blades to perform cutting tasks could be linked to the processing of guanaco. Thus, the blade assemblages recovered at the coast support a substantial difference in the hunter-gatherer use of the northern shore of Viedma lake. It is proposed that the production of blades has a supraregional manifestation shared by areas of the Tar and Argentino lake coasts, located to the North and South of Viedma lake, respectively. The characteristics of the archaeological contexts with higher blade frequency would explain their use within a background provided by flake technology.																			0327-5159	1853-8126				MAY-AUG	2023	29	2							11742	10.34096/arqueologia.t29.n2.11742	http://dx.doi.org/10.34096/arqueologia.t29.n2.11742													WOS:001001901000001

However, ecological evidence for the colonization of the Ediacaran terrestrial biosphere by photosynthetic communities and their contribution to the oxygenation of the biosphere at this time is very sparse. Here, we expand the repertoire of Ediacaran habitable environments to a specific microbial community that thrived in an extreme alkaline volcanic lake 571 Myr ago in the Anti-atlas of Morocco. The microbial fabrics preserve evidence of primary growth structures, comprised of two main microbialitic units, with the lower section consisting of irregular and patchy thrombolytic mesoclots associated with composite microbialitic domes. Calcirudite interbeds, dominated by wave-rippled sandy calcarenites and stromatoclasts, fill the interdome troughs and seal the dome tops. A meter-thick epiclastic stromatolite bed grading upwards from a dominantly flat to wavy laminated base, transitions into low convex laminae consisting of decimeter to meter-thick dome-shaped stromatolitic columns, overlies the thrombolitic and composite microbialitic facies. Microbialitic beds constructed during periods of limited clastic input, and underlain by coarse-grained microbialite-derived clasts and by the wave-rippled calcarenites, suggest high-energy events associated with lake expansion. High-resolution microscopy revealed spherulitic aggregates and structures reminiscent of coccoidal microbial cell casts and mineralized extra-polymeric substances (EPS). The primary fabrics and multistage diagenetic features, represented by active carbonate production, photosynthesizing microbial communities, photosynthetic gas bubbles, gas escape structures, and tufted mats, suggest specialized oxygenic photosynthesizers thriving in alkaline volcanic lakes, contributed toward oxygen variability in the Ediacaran terrestrial biosphere.

J	Christiansen, CT; Mack, MC; DeMarco, J; Grogan, P				Christiansen, Casper T.; Mack, Michelle C.; DeMarco, Jennie; Grogan, Paul			Decomposition of Senesced Leaf Litter is Faster in Tall Compared to Low Birch Shrub Tundra	ECOSYSTEMS												Many Low Arctic tundra regions are currently undergoing a vegetation shift towards increasing growth and groundcover of tall deciduous shrubs due to recent climate warming. Vegetation change directly affects ecosystem carbon balance, but it can also affect soil biogeochemical cycling through physical and biological feedback mechanisms. Recent studies indicate that enhanced snow accumulation around relatively tall shrubs has negligible physical effect on litter decomposition rates. However, these investigations were no more than 3 years, and therefore may be insufficient to detect differences in inherently slow biogeochemical processes. Here, we report a 5-year study near Daring Lake, Canada, comparing Betula neoalaskana foliar litter decay rates within unmanipulated and snowfenced low-stature birch (height: similar to 0.3 m) plots to test the physical effect of experimentally deepened snow, and within tall birch (height: similar to 0.8 m) plots to test the combined physical and biological effects, that is, deepened snow plus strong birch dominance. Having corrected for carbon gain by the colonizing decomposers, actual litter carbon loss increased by approximately 25% in the tall birch relative to both low birch sites. Decay of lignin-like acid unhydrolizable litter residues also accelerated in the tall birch site, and a similar but lower magnitude response in the snowfenced low birch site indicated that physical effects of deepened snow were at least partially responsible. In contrast, deepened snow alone did not affect litter carbon loss. Our findings suggest that a combination of greater litter inputs, altered soil microbial community, enhanced soil nutrient pools, and warmer winter soils together promote relatively fast decomposition of recalcitrant litter carbon in tall birch shrub environments.

J	Whitman, RL; Nevers, MB				Whitman, RL; Nevers, MB			Foreshore sand as a source of Escherichia coli in nearshore water of a Lake Michigan beach	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Swimming advisories due to excessive Escherichia coli concentrations are common at 63rd Street Beach, Chicago, Ill. An intensive study was undertaken to characterize the source and fate of E. coli in beach water and sand at the beach. From April through September 2000, water and sand samples were collected daily or twice daily at two depths on three consecutive days per week (water samples, n = 1,747; sand samples, n = 858); hydrometeorological conditions and bird and bather distributions were also recorded. E. coli concentrations in sand and water were significantly correlated, with the highest concentration being found in foreshore sand, followed by those in submerged sediment and water of increasing depth. Gull contributions to E. coli densities in sand and water were most apparent on the day following gull activity in a given area. E. coli recolonized newly placed foreshore sand within 2 weeks. Analysis of variance, correlation, cluster analyses, concentration gradients, temporal-spatial distribution, demographic patterns, and DNA fingerprinting suggest that E. coli may be able to sustain population density in temperate beach sand during summer months without external inputs. This research presents evidence that foreshore beach sand (i) plays a major role in bacterial lake water quality, (ii) is an important non-point source of E. coli to lake water rather than a net sink, (iii) may be environmentally, and perhaps hygienically, problematic, and (iv) is possibly capable of supporting an autochthonous, high density of indicator bacteria for sustained periods, independent of lake, human, or animal input.

Existing evidence on the effects of climate variability and climate change on ungulates in North America: a systematic map	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE												Background Climate is an important driver of ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migratory behaviors. Climate conditions can directly impact ungulates via changes in the costs of thermoregulation and locomotion, or indirectly, via changes in habitat and forage availability, predation, and species interactions. Many studies have documented the effects of climate variability and climate change on North America's ungulates, recording impacts to population demographics, physiology, foraging behavior, migratory patterns, and more. However, ungulate responses are not uniform and vary by species and geography. Here, we present a systematic map describing the abundance and distribution of evidence on the effects of climate variability and climate change on native ungulates in North America.Methods We searched for all evidence documenting or projecting how climate variability and climate change affect the 15 ungulate species native to the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Greenland. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, and the websites of 62 wildlife management agencies to identify relevant academic and grey literature. We screened English-language documents for inclusion at both the title and abstract and full-text levels. Data from all articles that passed full-text review were extracted and coded in a database. We identified knowledge clusters and gaps related to the species, locations, climate variables, and outcome variables measured in the literature.Review findings We identified a total of 674 relevant articles published from 1947 until September 2020. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were the most frequently studied species. Geographically, more research has been conducted in the western U.S. and western Canada, though a notable concentration of research is also located in the Great Lakes region. Nearly 75% more articles examined the effects of precipitation on ungulates compared to temperature, with variables related to snow being the most commonly measured climate variables. Most studies examined the effects of climate on ungulate population demographics, habitat and forage, and physiology and condition, with far fewer examining the effects on disturbances, migratory behavior, and seasonal range and corridor habitat.Conclusions The effects of climate change, and its interactions with stressors such as land-use change, predation, and disease, is of increasing concern to wildlife managers. With its broad scope, this systematic map can help ungulate managers identify relevant climate impacts and prepare for future changes to the populations they manage. Decisions regarding population control measures, supplemental feeding, translocation, and the application of habitat treatments are just some of the management decisions that can be informed by an improved understanding of climate impacts. This systematic map also identified several gaps in the literature that would benefit from additional research, including climate effects on ungulate migratory patterns, on species that are relatively understudied yet known to be sensitive to changes in climate, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), and on ungulates in the eastern U.S. and Mexico.					; Weiskopf, Sarah/K-1633-2019; Thompson, Laura/GSD-7827-2022	Weiskopf, Sarah/0000-0002-5933-8191; Kurth, Katherine/0000-0002-6883-8307; 														2047-2382				APR 4	2024	13	1							8	10.1186/s13750-024-00331-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-024-00331-8								39294746					WOS:001197165300001
J	Coghlan, SM; Ringler, NH				Coghlan, SM; Ringler, NH			Temperature-dependent effects of rainbow trout on growth of Atlantic salmon parr	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Temperature may influence interactions between species by regulating energy balances of individuals. We conducted a laboratory study to determine whether temperature influenced the effects exerted by large rainbow trout on the growth of Atlantic salmon parr. Bioenergetic models were used to predict maintenance rations so that food resources were limiting over a range of temperatures; equal biomasses of rainbow trout were substituted for Atlantic salmon to evaluate the relative effect of interspecific interactions on Atlantic salmon growth. In the presence of rainbow trout, salmon growth increased as temperatures increased from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C; no such temperature effect occurred for salmon maintained alone. Growth differences between salmon maintained with and without trout were highly significant at 25 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C. We conclude that the presence of trout depressed salmon growth at 15 degrees C but not at higher temperatures, most likely a result of differences in thermal optima between these two species. Field data show that the proportion of stocked Atlantic salmon to wild rainbow trout coexisting in natural streams is a function of mean summer temperature. As stream temperatures increased, Atlantic salmon became increasingly favored over rainbow trout, but with a concomitant decrease in total salmonine biomass. We suggest that Atlantic salmon restoration programs focus more attention on relatively warm streams in watersheds where interactions with naturalized rainbow trout may occur.																			0380-1330						2005	31	4					386	396		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70270-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70270-7													WOS:000234491200002

The expansion of the Potamotrygonidae family in the Parana River began after the damming of the Sete Quedas Falls, reaching the mouth of the Paranapanema and Tiete rivers approximately 20 years ago via the locks of the hydroelectric power plants. They are not aggressive animals; however, they have one to four stingers on their tails covered by a venom-producing epithelium and can cause severe envenomation in fishermen and bathers if stepped on or manipulated.Methods: We conducted a descriptive, retrospective, and prospective study by monitoring the fishing of the Potamotrygon genus in the lower Tiete River, mapping the location of the rays as a fishery product of professional fishermen and/or recording images of the fish caught.Results: Sixteen stingrays of the Potamotrygon genus were mapped by monitoring fishermen's fish products in the extensive area between the municipalities of Pereira Barreto and Buritama, Sao Paulo state.Conclusions: The lower Tiete River is fully colonized by freshwater stingrays and this expansion likely continues upstream, reaching various sub-basins of the river. The advancement of these venomous fish in areas where they did not exist previously requires education programs and interaction with the community to avoid serious injuries in bathers and fishermen and the unreasonable extermination of the animals.

A phytoplankton biodiversity study was undertaken to calculate biological contamination indicators and to determine the relative abundance of phytoplankton genera in its ecosystem. In the environment, algae produce both benefits such as oxygen and the conversion of light energy into chemicals, something which is reflected in the accumulation of biomass through photosynthesis collateral damage, such as the production of toxins: by Cyanophyta algae. Five monitoring points were established, and samples were collected monthly, in 2014. Phytoplankton identificaction and morphological classification were performed by microscopy. This paper is the first of its kind to describe the predominant communities in the lake chlorophytes, followed by cyanophytes and the evolutionary correlation of the genera using phylogenetic trees. The study gave rise to expectations in different research fields since species with environmental health and human health applications (Scenedesmus spp. and Chlorella spp.), species which are sources of biomolecules with a high nutritional value as proteins and vitamins, such as Monoraphidium spp., a species with application in the synthesis of biofuels (Botryococcus spp.), and species with a therapeutic application as producers of antioxidants and immune modulators or as producers of toxings, such as Pseudanabaena spp., were identified. A strong correlation between the presence of the cyanophyte species found (Microcystis spp. and Anabaena spp.) and the death of fish during the summer was observed.

From April 1993 to May 1994, 182 specimens (87 males, 83 females, 12 sexually indeterminate) distributed among seven age classes were captured. The length-weight regression was W = 0.00988LT(3.1512+/-0.027) (males) and W = 0.00888LT(3.184+/-0.032) (females) without any significant differences between sexes. The growth of the 1+age-class is not continuous throughout the year; it slows to almost nothing in the winter, The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve for length were L-infinity = 46.88, K = 0.33 and t(0) = 0.056 for the females and L-infinity = 39.4, K = 0.42 and t(0) = 0.019 for the males. The condition factor indicates that the Lake Trasimeno population is in excellent condition. Reproduction occurs mostly in May. Sexual maturity is reached at 2 years for males and 3 years for females, at lengths and weights of 22 cm and 160 g for males and 30 cm and 397 g for females, respectively. Largemouth bass has adapted well to Lake Trasimeno where physical and trophic conditions favour growth and reproduction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the impact mechanisms of different nutrient levels on greenhouse gas emission from lakes are still insufficient. In this study, the sediments from eight shallow lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were cultured to study the release characteristics of greenhouse gases more than one month. Results showed that the greenhouse gases during the mineralization processes of sediments were mainly released to the atmosphere instead of being dissolved in the overlying water. The released concentrations of CH(4)and CO(2)were as high as 1 x 10(3) mu mol L(-1)in the later stage of the experiment, while the concentration of N2O was relatively low with a maximal value of about 10 mu mol L-1. In addition, all the lake sediments displayed a nutrient release to the overlying water, where the concentrations of TC, TOC, TN, NH4+-N and TP were up to 173.0, 102.7, 36.7, 30.8 and 6.34 mg L-1, respectively. The nutrient levels of different lake sediments are symmetrical to the released nutrients concentrations in the overlying water. The further statistical analysis illustrated a synchronous nutrient controlled-release of greenhouse gases, that is, the higher the levels of nutrients in the sediments, the higher the concentrations of greenhouse gases released. These findings provide a better understanding that the control of endogenous nutrient levels of sediments is extremely important for lacustrine management, which can play a positive role in mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions from lake sediments.

Long-term variability and density dependence in Hudson River Dreissena populations	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We used a 27-year record of Dreissena populations in the freshwater tidal Hudson River to describe interannual variation in population density, body size, and body condition; estimate long-term variation in recruitment, survivorship, and shell growth; and assess possible controls on the populations. Dreissena populations in the Hudson have been highly variable, with interannual ranges of c. 100-fold in abundance and biomass, and 7-fold in mean body mass. This large interannual variation arises from both long-term trends and 2-5-year cycles. Long-term trends include the 2008 appearance of the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis), which still forms a small part (<10%) of the dreissenid community, and a decline in zebra mussel body size. The decline in body size was caused by a long-term decline in adult survivorship rather than a decline in rates of shell growth. We could detect no long-term trends in adult abundance or spread of Dreissena onto soft sediments in the Hudson. We observed persistent, strong cycles in adult abundance and body size. These were driven by the appearance and decay of eight dominant year classes over the 27 years of our study, and were a result of temporal variation in recruitment rather than temporal variation in survivorship. The observed strongly irregular recruitment appears to arise from strong adult-larval interactions, and is consistent with previous simulation model results showing that interactions between adults and larvae can drive persistent cycling. We found evidence that negative density dependence affects recruitment, somatic growth, and body condition of Dreissena in the Hudson. Warm summers may also cause high adult mortality. We put our results into the context of a conceptual model of Dreissena population dynamics, and argue that neither the dynamics nor the controls of populations of these important invaders is known satisfactorily.					; Solomon, Christopher/E-6284-2014; Strayer, David/H-3788-2011; Hamilton, Stephen/N-2979-2014	Strayer, David/0000-0002-6767-4486; Solomon, Christopher/0000-0002-2850-4257; Hamilton, Stephen/0000-0002-4702-9017													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2020	65	3					474	489		10.1111/fwb.13444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13444		DEC 2019											WOS:000501106800001

On the Potential Impact of Lake Erie Wind Farms on Water Temperatures and Mixed-Layer Depths: Some Preliminary 1-D Modeling Using COHERENS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Lake Erie has a significant wind energy resource potential, with extensive areas of moderate water depth and proximity to major cities and industries with substantial electricity demands. The presence of significant numbers of large turbines in wind farms will lead to reduced wind speeds and wind stresses in the wakes within and downwind of the farms. This in turn will affect surface fluxes, currents, and mixing in lake waters, generally allowing increased surface temperatures and reduced summer time mixed-layer depths. The potential magnitude of these impacts is investigated with a one dimensional application of the Coupled Hydrodynamical-Ecological Model for Regional and Shelf Seas model for three different water depths using observed meteorological data as input. Plain Language Summary Once a wind farm is installed there will be modifications to the wind field caused by the wakes of the turbines. This has been well studied for wind farms such as Horns Rev in the North Sea. For Lakes Erie and Ontario the areas with water depths suitable for wind farms are limited and we envisage multiple farms relatively close together. Wake effects will then cause significant reductions in the overall wind field of the area and have potentially significant impacts on mixing and air-water gas transfers. The research goal is to study airflow over selected Great Lakes with and without wind farms and to investigate the potential impact of wind farm development on circulation, mixing, and water quality issues.

High-resolution records detect human-caused changes to the boreal forest wildfire regime in interior Alaska	HOLOCENE												Stand-replacing wildfires are a keystone disturbance in the boreal forest, and they are becoming more common as the climate warms. Paleo-fire archives from the wildland-urban interface can quantify the prehistoric fire regime and assess how both human land-use and climate change impact ecosystem dynamics. Here, we use a combination of a sedimentary charcoal record preserved in varved lake sediments (annually layered) and fire scars in living trees to document changes in local fire return intervals (FRIs) and regional fire activity over the last 500 years. Ace Lake is within the boreal forest, located near the town of Fairbanks in interior Alaska, which was settled by gold miners in AD 1902. In the 400 years before settlement, fires occurred near the lake on average every 58 years. After settlement, fires became much more frequent (average every 18 years), and background charcoal flux rates rose to four times their preindustrial levels, indicating a region-wide increase in burning. Despite this surge in burning, the preindustrial boreal forest ecosystem and permafrost in the watershed have remained intact. Although fire suppression has reduced charcoal influx since the 1950s, an aging fuel load experiencing increasingly warm summers may pose management problems for this and other boreal sites that have similar land-use and fire histories. The large humancaused fire events that we identify can be used to test how increasingly common megafires may alter ecosystem dynamics in the future.

It can also have indirect effects such as environmental, socio-economic, and political instability. In the municipality of Sete Lagoas, Brazil, the long-term effects of extensive groundwater extraction have been observed and studied over the years. This paper analyzes the response of the karst aquifer to urban, industrial, and climatological changes that may have contributed to changes in the aquifer over the last four decades. The results show that groundwater extraction has exceeded the average aquifer recharge since the year 2000. From the 1980s, the number of wells has steadily increased due to unplanned urban development, resulting in higher demand for groundwater. In the 2010s, pumping from tubular wells (7.39 x 107 m3/yr) exceeded the maximum recharge capacity of the aquifer (7.33 x 107 m3/yr). These wells are mainly concentrated in two areas: the central urban zone and the industrial sector. As a result, kilometer-long cones of depression have formed, changing the aquifer from confined to unconfined within these regions. According to the census data, about 67% of the wells remain unidentified. The average annual recharge to the aquifer is estimated to be 5.68 x 107 m3/yr, which accounts for 12% of the average annual rainfall in the region. Climatological trends indicate an incipient decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature, suggesting a potential decrease in future aquifer recharge. In addition, only 17% of the area has high infiltration rates ranging from 35% to 75%. The current situation in Sete Lagoas is one of overexploitation of groundwater resources, which could be mitigated by localized reduction of groundwater consumption and implementation of effective management strategies to increase aquifer recharge.					; Galvão, Paulo/Q-7928-2017	Schuch, Camila/0000-0002-2830-0510; Pereira, Simone/0000-0003-1428-203X; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV 1	2023	236		2						116820	10.1016/j.envres.2023.116820	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.116820		AUG 2023						37541417					WOS:001053158900001
J	Mayle, FE; Cwynar, LC				Mayle, FE; Cwynar, LC			A review of multi-proxy data for the Younger Dryas in Atlantic Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Multi-proxy data obtained from lake sediments and buried organic sequences is reviewed and discussed as evidence for the Younger Dryas cooling event in Atlantic Canada. Sedimentological studies indicate that lake basins were subject to increased erosion due to climate cooling, while glacial and periglacial sediments overlying peats have been attributed to the effects of small Younger Dryas ice-caps building up in highland areas of Nova Scotia. Pollen evidence from over 30 sites shows two broad patterns of Lateglacial vegetation change in the region. The Younger Dryas cooling caused the replacement of closed boreal forest by shrub-tundra in southern New Brunswick and central mainland Nova Scotia, and the replacement of shrub-tundra by herb-tundra in central New Brunswick, northern Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Chironomid data indicate that the Younger Dryas was marked by a drop in summer lake surface-water temperatures of ca. 6 degrees C, while diatom data suggest that marked limnological changes also occurred. Based on AMS C-14 dates from terrestrial plant macrofossils of 8 sites, the Younger Dryas event in Atlantic Canada lasted from ca. 10,830 to 10,000 BP. These dates match most of those from northwest and central Europe, suggesting that this climatic event affected the entire North Atlantic region essentially simultaneously.

Insufficient bathing water quality and frequent beach closings, especially in the Oder river mouth, hamper tourism development. Monitoring data gives only an incomplete picture of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria sources, spatial transport patterns, risks and does neither support an efficient bathing water quality management nor decision making. We apply a 3D ocean model and a Lagrangian particle tracking model to analyse pollution events and to obtain spatial E. coli pollution maps based on scenario simulations. Model results suggests that insufficient sewage treatment in the city of Szczecin is the major source of faecal pollution, even for beaches 20 km downstream. E. coli mortality rate and emission intensity are key parameters for concentration levels downstream. Wind and river discharge play a modifying role. Prevailing southwestern wind conditions cause E. coli transport along the eastern coast and favour high concentration levels at the beaches. Our simulations indicate that beach closings in 2006 would not have been necessary according to the new EU-Bathing Water Quality Directive (2006/7/EC). The implementation of the new directive will, very likely, reduce the number of beach closings, but not the risk for summer tourists.

J	Martel, P; Kovacs, T; Voss, R; Megraw, S				Martel, P; Kovacs, T; Voss, R; Megraw, S			Evaluation of caged freshwater mussels as an alternative method for environmental effects monitoring (EEM) studies	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												xOn three occasions between 1998 and 2000, freshwater mussels were collected by divers in Lake Memphremagog during the spring and transplanted to various locations in the St-Francois River (Quebec, Canada). Mussel growth was monitored by comparing total weight and length at the beginning and end of the exposure period. In 1998, mussels were caged for 60 days at 10 stations, including locations receiving treated effluents from three pulp and paper mills. Overall, there was an apparent trend of increased mussel growth from upstream to downstream along the river. However, mussels caged downstream from the effluent discharge of a bleached kraft pulp and paper mill grew more slowly than those caged immediately upstream in the river. In 1999 and 2000, we further investigated the situation in the vicinity of this bleached kraft mill. The measurements again indicated that growth of mussels in the effluent plume from this mill was reduced in comparison to sites upstream. Overall, in terms of growth, the caged mussels responded both positively and negatively to different environmental conditions. Compared with other monitoring approaches used at these sites during the same period, the caged mussel experiment results were consistent with the trends observed with the benthic invertebrate survey but not with the trends observed for fish.

In the east, Entisols support open jack pine stands. In the central transect, weak Spodosols have formed under oak-pine-aspen forests. In the Lake Michigan snowbelt on the west, strongly developed Spodosols occur beneath mesic northern hardwoods. We hypothesized that increasing amounts of snowfall, coupled with decreasing fire frequencies, promote soil development and enhance soil C dynamics at western sites. We also hypothesized that enhanced soil development facilitated greater proportions of broadleaf tree establishment, which in turn accelerates snowmelt rates and further facilitates soil development by enhancing deeper C translocation. Along the transect, we described, sampled, and characterized twelve soils. Soil development increases east to west along the transect, changing most rapidly at the inner margins of the snowbelt, near the coniferous-broadleaf forest ecotone. Coincident with strong soil development in the snowbelt is an increase in soil C storage and cycling. Depth profiles of C, C-13, and Fe- and Al- humus complexes all suggest that snowmelt percolation drives these patterns. Hardwoods produce and cycle more C than coniferous stands to the east and have thicker snowpacks. In the snowbelt, late-lying snowpacks limit spring fires, and large pulses of snowmelt water drive the fresh, soluble C from O horizons deeper, enhancing soil development and fostering ecosystem productivity. Although the current snowbelt, climate, and fire patterns across the peninsula might date only to approximate to 7,000 cal yr BP, they have nonetheless affected pedogenesis to the point that a major Entisol-to-Spodosol continuum has formed.

Estimates of bacterial and phytoplankton mortality caused by viral lysis and microzooplankton grazing in a shallow eutrophic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Since viral lysis and zooplankton grazing differ in their impact on the aquatic food web, it is important to assess the relative importance of both mortality factors. In this study, an adapted version of the dilution technique was applied to simultaneously estimate the impact of both viral lysis and zooplankton grazing on the mortality of heterotrophic bacteria, eukaryotic algae, unicellular cyanobacteria, prochlorophytes and especially filamentous cyanobacteria in a shallow eutrophic lake. 2. Four dilution experiments were performed in December 2004, January 2005, and March and April 2006. Viral and heterotrophic bacterial abundances were obtained by epifluorescence microscopy and abundances of different phytoplankton groups by flow cytometry and light microscopy. 3. Viral lysis was identified as the main mortality cause during the December 2004 and January 2005 experiments, apparently removing between 84% and 97% of the potential filamentous cyanobacterial production and up to 101% of the potential heterotrophic bacterial production. Microzooplankton grazing was estimated to remove between 90% and 99% of the potential unicellular cyanobacterial production and up to 46% of the potential heterotrophic bacterial production during the spring 2006 experiments. 4. In some cases, no significant impact of viral lysis or zooplankton grazing was detected. Contrary to expectations, the apparent growth rate of filamentous cyanobacteria was even sometimes observed to decrease significantly upon dilution of microzooplankton. 5. The dilution technique can give valuable insight into the impact of zooplankton grazing and viral lysis on the mortality of different plankton groups but require some caveats require special care to be taken when comparing and interpreting results.

Assessment of water quality in a lake with limited tourist pressure due to the COVID-19 lockdown	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												This study provides a unique opportunity to realistically assess the impact of tourism pressure on the water quality of lakes. A quantitative analysis of the physicochemical and microbiological parameters of water during and after the COVID-19 lockdown period was made. The study covered Sztynorckie Lake located in the Great Masurian Lakes System (GMLS) (northeastern Poland), which is a holiday destination for hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers, and serves as a pillar of the local economy. Significant improvement in the microbiological water quality was observed only during the drastic reduction of human activity due to the pandemic-enforced lockdown. This was confirmed by the results of PCA (X-axis explains 88 % of the variability of the analyzed samples; statistical significance of p<0.05). The rapid increase in the number of coliforms and Escherichia coli (613.1 MPN/100 mL) in the first weekend after the lockdown (June 2020) indicates a point discharge of sewage (including fecal pollution). Illegal discharge of sewage and wastewater is a highly reprehensible offense, and radical legal steps should be taken to prevent it and to protect the water quality. No significant relationship was found between the lockdown and the lake water's physicochemical conditions. In the spring, increased primary production was evidenced by the high concentration of chlorophyll a (52.5 to 70.5 mu g/L), suspended particulate matter (20.4 to 21.0 mg/L) and total organic carbon (20.7 to 22.7 mg/L). This is a warning that a nutrient-rich lacustrine ecosystem cannot be restored quickly.

Diatom fluxes in a tropical, oligotrophic lake dominated by large-sized phytoplankton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Alchichica is a warm-monomictic, oligotrophic lake whose phytoplanktonic biomass is dominated by large size (average ca. 55 mu m) diatoms. The fast sinking phytoplankton leads to silica, and other nutrient exportation out of the productive zone of the lake. The aim of the present study was to identify and measure the sedimentation fluxes of the diatom species and their temporal dynamics to better understand the magnitude of silica and carbon fluxes. Sediment-traps were exposed at three different depths and collected monthly. A total of 13 diatom species were observed in the traps. The maximum diatom flux was in February (304 x 10(6) cells m(-2) day(-1)) related to the winter diatom bloom. The diatom silica (DSi) fluxes varied from 2.2 to 2,997 mg m(-2) day(-1) and the diatom carbon (DC) fluxes from 1.2 to 2,918 mg m(-2) d(-1). Cyclotella alchichicana was the main contributor (> 98%) to the total DSi and DC fluxes. The annual diatom (15 x 10(9) cells m(-2) year(-1)), DSi (147 g m(-2) year(-1)) and DC (92 g m(-2) year(-1)) fluxes are higher than in other aquatic ecosystems of similar or even higher trophic conditions. Our findings in Alchichica are indicative of the relevance of the phytoplankton type and size in understanding the role tropical and oligotrophic lakes play regarding silica and carbon fluxes. In addition, our results support previous findings suggesting that inland aquatic ecosystems are more important than formerly thought in processing carbon, and can, therefore, affect regional carbon balances.					; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Vilaclara, Gloria/0000-0003-4923-891X; Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2012	679	1					77	90		10.1007/s10750-011-0853-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0853-7													WOS:000297620100006

Mechanisms of aggradation in fluvial systems influenced by explosive volcanism: An example from the Upper Cretaceous Bajo Barreal Formation, San Jorge Basin, Argentina	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Late Cretaceous succession of the San Jorge Basin (Patagonia, Argentina) records different continental settings that interacted with explosive volcanism derived from a volcanic arc located in the western part of Patagonia. This paper discusses the contrasting aggradational mechanisms in fluvial systems strongly influenced by explosive volcanism which took place during sedimentation of the Bajo Barreal Formation. During deposition of the lower member of the unit, common ash-fall events and scarce sandy debris-flows occurred, indicating syn-eruptive conditions. However, the record of primary pyroclastic deposits is scarce because they were reworked by river flows. The sandy fluvial channels were braided and show evidence of important variations in water discharge. The overbank flows (sheet-floods) represent the main aggradational mechanism of the floodplain. In places, subordinate crevasse-splays and shallow lakes also contributed to the floodplain aggradation. In contrast, deposition of the upper member occurred in a fluvial-aeolian setting without input of primary volcaniclastic detritus, indicating inter-eruptive conditions. The fluvial channels were also braided and flowed across low-relief floodplains that mainly aggraded by deposition of silt-sized sediments of aeolian origin (loess) and, secondarily by sheet-floods. The Bajo Barreal Formation differs from the classic model of syn-eruptive and inter-eruptive depositional conditions in the presence of a braided fluvial pattern during inter-eruptive periods, at least at one locality. This braided fluvial pattern is attributed to the high input of fine-grained pyroclastic material that composes the loessic sediments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	VESTJENS, WJM				VESTJENS, WJM			BREEDING-BEHAVIOR AND ECOLOGY OF AUSTRALIAN PELICAN, PELECANUS-CONSPICILLATUS, IN NEW-SOUTH-WALES	AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The breeding behavior and ecology of the Australian pelican was studied from 1968-1976 at Lake George and Lake Cowal, New South Wales [Australia]. There are differences in the color patterns of the gular pouch of courting, nesting and non-breeding adults. Comfort movements and signal patterns used at the breeding area are described. Courtship behavior consists of group displays of walking, swimming and flights away from the nest site. After pair-formation the female selects the nest site and digs a scrape in the soil. Both birds collect nest material: the female without leaving the nest, hauls material towards it while the male collects from some distance away. Eggs are laid between Aug-Dec. and the average clutch size is 2. Both birds incubate. Incubation takes 32-35 days. Young are fed by their parents by regurgitation until .apprx. 3 1/2 mo. old. Immediately after each young is fed it experiences a convulsion. Chicks vary in the color of iris, bill, skin around the eye and head and neck plumage. At 132 days after hatching these variations disappear. Breeding failed when water levels fluctuated: rising levels flooded breeding areas; falling levels allowed mammalian predators to enter and disturb the colonies. The main cause of losses of eggs was group displays by courting adults.																			0310-7833						1977	4	1					37	58																WOS:A1977DA13500005
J	FOX, MG; KEAST, A				FOX, MG; KEAST, A			EFFECTS OF WINTERKILL ON POPULATION-STRUCTURE, BODY SIZE, AND PREY CONSUMPTION PATTERNS OF PUMPKINSEED IN ISOLATED BEAVER PONDS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Beaver ponds are a ubiquitous, but rarely studied, aquatic habitat that are subject to hypoxia and other catastrophic events that can affect fish populations. We examined the population dynamics and feeding ecology of pumpkinseeds (Lepomis gibbosus) inhabiting two isolated Ontario beaver ponds and adjacent Lake Opinicon to determine the persistence of and reasons for small body size in pond populations. Pumpkinseed populations fluctuated drastically in both ponds as a result of winterkills (from hypoxia and a decline in water level). These winterkills eliminated as many as 96% of the older pumpkinseeds and resulted in populations consisting mainly of age 0-2 individuals. Pond pumpkinseeds rarely survived to age 5, whereas lake conspecifics lived to age 8 or older. The diet of pond pumpkinseeds consisted mainly of chironomids, ephemeropterans, odonates, and molluscs, whereas lake pumpkinseeds ate mainly molluscs. The difference in diets was attributed mainly to differences in prey availability in the two habitats. Despite lower prey biomass and higher population density, pond pumpkinseeds grew as fast as, or faster than, their lake conspecifics owing mainly to early warming of water in the spring and the absence of bluegills and other major competitors. We conclude that small body size in pond pumpkinseed populations is due to high annual mortality and not stunted growth.																			0008-4301					DEC	1990	68	12					2489	2498		10.1139/z90-348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-348													WOS:A1990EU11200006

Planktonic functional diversity changes in synchrony with lake ecosystem state	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Managing ecosystems to effectively preserve function and services requires reliable tools that can infer changes in the stability and dynamics of a system. Conceptually, functional diversity (FD) appears as a sensitive and viable monitoring metric stemming from suggestions that FD is a universally important measure of biodiversity and has a mechanistic influence on ecological processes. It is however unclear whether changes in FD consistently occur prior to state responses or vice versa, with no current work on the temporal relationship between FD and state to support a transition towards trait-based indicators. There is consequently a knowledge gap regarding when functioning changes relative to biodiversity change and where FD change falls in that sequence. We therefore examine the lagged relationship between planktonic FD and abundance-based metrics of system state (e.g. biomass) across five highly monitored lake communities using both correlation and cutting edge non-linear empirical dynamic modelling approaches. Overall, phytoplankton and zooplankton FD display synchrony with lake state but each lake is idiosyncratic in the strength of relationship. It is therefore unlikely that changes in plankton FD are identifiable before changes in more easily collected abundance metrics. These results highlight the power of empirical dynamic modelling in disentangling time lagged relationships in complex multivariate ecosystems, but suggest that FD cannot be generically viable as an early indicator. Individual lakes therefore require consideration of their specific context and any interpretation of FD across systems requires caution. However, FD still retains value as an alternative state measure or a trait representation of biodiversity when considered at the system level.					; Thackeray, Stephen/D-2415-2013	O'Brien, Duncan/0000-0002-3420-5210; Clements, Christopher/0000-0001-5677-5401; Matsuzaki, Shin-ichiro/0000-0003-2744-1343; Gal, Gideon/0000-0002-6962-4001; Thackeray, Stephen/0000-0003-3274-2706													1354-1013	1365-2486				FEB	2023	29	3					686	701		10.1111/gcb.16485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16485		NOV 2022						36370051					WOS:000882001100001

NATURAL HERITAGE OF JAPAN: GEOLOGICAL, GEOMORPHOLOGICAL, AND ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS	Geoheritage Geoparks and Geotourism											Akan National Park is found on the Island of Hokkaido. It was designated in 1934 as one of the second batch of properties to be declared national parks in Japan. The natural heritage of the area includes a group of volcanoes, Me-akandake, O-akandake, and Akan-Fuji, and three lakes of volcanic origin, Akan-ko, Kussharo-ko, and Mashu-ko. The geological structure consists of a large caldera that originated in the early Pleistocene and a group of younger partly Holocene, andesitic, and dacitic cones. The highest point of the complex is the Me-akandake (1499 m) stratovolcano. It consists of nine overlapping cones, with three summit craters, and has erupted least 17 times since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The national park based on this natural heritage is a popular visitor destination, offering sought-after views and bathing opportunities all year round and skiing and other snow sports in the winter. Lake Akan-ko is also known for its "marimo"-a species of algae that forms large green balls when mature-and a natural phenomenon that in Japan is unique to this lake. The social capital of the area also includes traditional Ainu settlements (an early Japanese indigenous ethnic group now mainly confined to Hokkaido). This is an important feature given that cultural geotourism is a global phenomenon. Many indigenous communities offer their unique interpretations of natural and other forms of heritage, including food, around the world, and the implications of such an interest by tourists for the Ainu community around the lake are considerable.																			2363-765X		978-3-319-61896-8; 978-3-319-61895-1				2018							153	159		10.1007/978-3-319-61896-8_14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61896-8_14	10.1007/978-3-319-61896-8												WOS:000448722400016

A dry-ash technique was used to extract biogenic silica from mature leaves from plants grown in potting mix. Phytolith morphology and abundance were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy respectively. Biogenic silica concentrations were lowest (<1%) in Chionochloa bromoides, C. rubra ssp. occulta, and Festuca multinodis and reached levels of c. 7% in Chionochloa defracta and Festuca ultramafica, two serpentine endemics. Cluster analysis showed that replicate samples of taxa were classified together in 70% of cases. Ordination of phytolith types identified a major gradient based on the presence/absence of panicoid and chloridoid types. A secondary gradient was related to the frequency of chionochloid, truncated cone, and other short-cell phytoliths. Chionochloa taxa fall into 3 categories on the basis of the presence of panicoid (8 taxa) or chionochloid (11 taxa) phytolith types, or the absence of both (14 taxa). Species of Festuca had relatively high frequencies of points compared with Chionochloa, and absence or low frequency of dumbbell and chionochloid types. There was more interspecific variation among species of Chionochloa than in Festuca.

Thus, an investigation of Hg concentrations in Lake Champlain and Lake Michigan was completed in the summer of 1993. Three depths of water including the microlayer, 30 cm below the surface, and 1 m below the thermocline were collected for each sampling event using ultra-clean techniques. All samples were processed in the field for dissolved and particulate fractions in a portable plastic enclosure equipped with a HEPA filter, and then analyzed by dual amalgamation and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy in a Class 100 clean room at the University of Michigan, In addition, samples were analyzed for other trace metals by ICP-MS. Results from the two field investigations include the following: (1) On average, Lake Michigan water samples had higher concentrations of Hg than Lake Champlain; (2) There was no consistent pattern of Hg concentrations in the water column; (3) There was variability in the concentrations of Hg from the same depths over consecutive sampling periods. This paper discusses these results, and examines the relationship between the patterns in mercury concentrations and other physical and chemical data collected during the investigation.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					581	584		10.1007/BF01189709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189709													WOS:A1995RM44200064

Notably, submerged vegetation also affect the hydrodynamic structure of the thermocline region of the lake which in turn affects the resuspension of benthic sediments. Therefore, based on meteorological and high-frequency hydrodynamic data, this study analyses the effect of wind field on the vertical shear of the flow field. Besides, study used Pier-son-Moskowitz (PM) spectra to strip wind and surge waves to elucidate the response mechanism of turbulence in Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake. Based on indoor experiments, we simulate the "wind value" (joint effect of wind speed and direction) on hydrodynamics and sediment release under different hydrophyte density cover. The results show that both wind and wave fields affect the hydrodynamic structure. In summer, the vertical shear layer of the flow field will shift downwards due to the wind field. The wave field consists of wind waves and surge waves, the wind waves having a greater impact on turbulence energy. A characteristic quantity 'wind value' is constructed using trigonometric functions which can characterize wind speed and wind direction of arbitrary magnitude. The correlation between 'wind value' and near-bottom turbulence is significantly better than that of wind speed alone, indicating that the effect of wind direction on turbulence cannot be ignored. Although, within a certain range, sediment re-suspension is not necessarily proportional to flow velocity but to turbulent kinetic energy due to the effect of wind direction. High-density submerged vegetation can form a wall boundary protection, which changes the flow pattern of the lake from mixed laminar flow to boundary laminar flow, reducing the intensity of turbulence and impeding sediment re-suspension. Findings of this study can provide a reference for endogenous control and aquatic ecological restoration in shallow lakes.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110767	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110767		AUG 2023											WOS:001059616800001

However, due to the lack of paleoclimate archives such as ice core and tree-rings above the modern tree line, limited paleoclimate data have been extracted to extend instrumental data over the past few centuries, which will help understand the interannual-to decadal-scale climate variability in high-altitude regions. Here we present a high-resolution (1-6 yr) quantitative temperature record from a remote alpine lake at the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, by applying a novel proxy based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs). Contrary to the often-documented warming trend over the past few centuries, but consistent with temperature record from the northern Tibetan Plateau, our data show a gradual decreasing trend of 0.3 degrees C in mean annual air temperature from 1750 to 1970 CE. This result suggests a gradual cooling trend in some high altitude regions over this interval, which could provide a new explanation for the observed decreasing Asian summer monsoon. In addition, our data indicate an abruptly increased interannual-to decadal-scale temperature variations of 0.8 - 2.2 degrees C after 1970 CE, in terms of both magnitude and frequency, indicating that the climate system in high altitude regions would become more unstable under current global warming.

J	Ohtaka, A; Nishino, M				Ohtaka, Akifumi; Nishino, Machiko			Studies on the aquatic oligochaete fauna in Lake Biwa, central Japan.: IV.: Faunal characteristics in the attached lakes (naiko)	LIMNOLOGY					9th International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaeta	OCT 06-10, 2003	Wageningen, NETHERLANDS	WIMEK, STOWA, Alterra Ctr Ecosyst Studies, Wageningen Univ Sub Dept Environm Technol, WU Dept Agrotechnol & Food Sci, KNAW, LEB Fdn, Altra Green World Res, Eijkelkamp				Surveys for macroinvertebrates occurring in 20 small attached lakes (naiko) adjacent to Lake Biwa, central Japan, conducted in 2001-2002 yielded 44 taxa of aquatic oligochaetes (Annelida, Clitellata). Descriptions and taxonomic remarks are provided for nine species: Aulophorus furcatus, A. tonkinensis, A. flabelliger, Pristina biserrata, P. proboscidea, Ilyodrilus templetoni, Allonais pectinata, Stylaria fossularis, and Dero dorsalis; the former six species of these are new to Japan. Stylaria fossularis is regarded as a distinct species, distinguished from the congener S. lacustris, on the basis of prostomium morphology and geographical distribution. No distinctive oligochaete fauna can be seen in the individual naiko, but as a collective body they maintain a rich fauna. This fauna was richer in naidines, while poorer in other groups of oligochaetes than those in Lake Biwa, and basically can be regarded as an extension of the fauna of littoral Lake Biwa. Epiphytic oligochaetes were more diverse and more abundant in the naiko than those in littoral Lake Biwa, probably because of higher temperatures, denser aquatic vegetation, and higher primary production. Summer oligochaete assemblages in the naiko were predominated by Stylaria fossularis and include several species characteristic of subtropical and tropical Asia, suggesting a close relationship to the fauna of the Indo-Malayan zoogeographical subregion.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2006	7	2					129	142		10.1007/s10201-006-0173-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-006-0173-1													WOS:000239754000008

The field studies were in the ablation region, where radar horizons could, at some point, be identified with interfaces between clear ice and air, water or basal ice, and were performed in early spring before drainage fully developed. The profiles used closely spaced antennas with bandwidths centered near 50 and 400 MHz. Transmitted wavelets reflected from interfaces of known dielectric contrasts are used to establish a phase reference for other events from interfaces between unknown contrasts. Migration and Fourier-transform filtering are then applied to the profiles and shown to recover these wavelets from diffractions and reflections. Interfacial dielectric contrasts are determined from the relative phase of the wavelets. Near the terminus lake, some basal ice events above 8 m depth are interpreted as voids. Further up-glacier, most englacial events are interpreted as voids, but deeper localized reflectors and horizons to 90 m depth and within the basal zone are interpreted as voids, water or debris. Phase cannot be determined for the basal-substrate transition reflections. Recommendations are made for improving the wavelet recovery process and the quality of GPR migration.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					1995	41	137					68	86		10.3189/S0022143000017779	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/S0022143000017779													WOS:A1995QR91200007

To this end, the strontium-calcium (Sr:Ca) ratios of the otoliths of 98 individuals were examined. Profiles of the Sr:Ca ratios during the life history after hatching in the estuary of the Ishikari River fell into two different patterns. One was characterized by a high (slightly fluctuating) Sr:Ca ratio throughout the life history; the other was characterized by an initial high Sr:Ca ratio followed by a lower value later in life. The former pattern was considered to be that of estuary-sea residents and the latter that of upstream migrants. Most upstream migrants migrated upstream once, although several did it twice. Back-calculated body lengths during the upstream and seaward migrations of the upstream migrants varied widely from 6.4 mm to 39.8 mm and from 13.5 mm to 79.4 mm, respectively. These findings suggest that estuary-sea residents and upstream migrants co-occurred spatiotemporally, and suggest a wide variation in migration patterns in the shirauo's life history.																			0919-9268					AUG	2004	70	4					546	552		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2004.00839.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2004.00839.x													WOS:000223632500003

The bridge consists of four reinforced concrete (RC) bents supporting composite welded steel girders; the bents are supported on cast-in-place concrete piles and pile caps. A vulnerability analysis of the bridge was conducted that determined deficiencies in (1) confinement of column lap splice regions, (2) anchorage of longitudinal column bars in the bent cap, (3) confinement of column plastic hinge zones, and (4) shear capacity of columns and bent cap-column joints. Seismic retrofit designs using carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) composites and steel jackets were performed and compared for three design spectra, including the 10% probability of exceedance in 250 years earthquake. The CFRP composite design was selected for implementation and application of the composite was carried out in the summer of 2000 and 2001, while the bridge was in service. The paper describes the CFRP composite design, which, in addition to column jackets, implemented an "ankle wrap" for improving joint shear strength and a "U-strap" for improving anchorage of column bars in the bent cap; other retrofit measures were implemented, such as bumper brackets and a deck slab retrofit. A capacity versus demand evaluation of the as-built and retrofitted bents is presented.

Concentrations of essential and toxic metals in sediments of Cd, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr, Mn, Hg, Fe, As and Zn were measured with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscope device. The mean essential and toxic metal contents of sediment samples were determined as Fe (10,646.65 mg/kg) > Mn (265.03 mg/kg) > Ni 20.46 mg/kg) > Zn (18.63 mg/kg) > Cr (16.34 mg/kg) > As (11.94 mg/kg) > Pb (5.22 mg/kg) > Cu (3.8 mg/kg) > Cd (2.3 mg/kg). Hg could not be determined because it is in the below detection limits. The potential ecological risk index was calculated for all the metals, except for Hg, in four locations. In the sample SDM1 considerable risk for Cd was detected, moderate risk was found in SDM2 sample and low risk was detected in SDM3 and SDM4 samples. No other ecological risk was found for other metals. The reason for the very high ecological risk was calculated for cadmium might be that cadmium has high toxicity coefficient compared to other metals and due to the use of phosphorous fertilizer containing cadmium in agricultural activities and activities in the field of industry affecting natural water flows, erosion or discharges passing through the Marmara Sea along the coast of Tekirdag province.

Sampling was done on a monthly basis from April to November 2007-2008. Microbial communities were examined in a transect including three sites: (1) pine forest (site located 5 m from the lagg/forest contact zone), (2) lagg, (3) open peatbog (the centre of the peatbog). At each of the sites, interstitial water was sampled by means of piezometric wells placed to a depth of 1 m. The species richness and abundance of protozoa and rotifers significantly differed between the studied stations, with the lowest numbers in the pine forest and the highest in the lagg. These differences between macro-habitats may be due to differences in environmental conditions. The distribution of samples in ordination space led to conclude that studied habitats are distributed along the falling gradient of pH and rising gradient of total organic carbon, water table depth and nitrate nitrogen. Assemblages of all three groups showed a strong compositional gradient correlated with water-table depth, conductivity and total phosphorus. However, species composition of ciliates and rotifers was explained by nitrate nitrogen and/or phosphates concentrations. The results suggest that lagg zone of a raised bog can fulfil the function of an ecotone zone, distinguished by a significant increase in biodiversity, abundance and species specificity of micro-organisms. It can also be a place of very efficient matter and energy flow in a peat bog ecosystem.

J	Glasser, NF; Nicholson, FH				Glasser, NF; Nicholson, FH			Subglacial meltwater erosion at Loch Treig	SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												Reports of small scale features of glacial erosion by meltwater are rare in Scotland. During the spring of 1996 unusually low water levels in the Loch Treig reservoir revealed an assemblage of exceptionally well-preserved glacial erosion forms sculpted in bedrock, including a suite of meltwater erosion forms. Within the assemblage of landforms at Loch Treig, there is a predominance of forms created by the now of subglacial meltwater and limited evidence of glacial abrasion. The Loch Treig features are therefore classed as subglacial meltwater erosion forms (s-forms and not p-forms). As such they are probably unique in Scotland. The meltwater forms described from this site include scallops, chutes, chute pools, potholes, and the less specific 'undulose smoothing' of bedrock surfaces. Large groups of 1-1.5 m-diameter scallops are interpreted as phreatic (formed below the water table) in origin. The potholes range from 0.5 m to over 3 m in diameter, with the larger potholes usually occurring in a series with interconnecting chutes. Chutes, chute pools and potholes are interpreted as vadose (formed above the water table) in origin. This interpretation of the suite of features accords well with the established Loch Lomond Stadial events in the area, which suggests that a substantial active glacier was still present in the north end of Glen Treig after the drainage of an ice dammed lake at 260 m in the Spean-Laggan area.

Kusatsu-shirane, Gunma, and in a volcanic block erupted by its volcanic activity were determined by the neutron activation analysis. The lanthanoids were detected at ppb levels in water samples and at ppm levels in solid samples, and no exception to the Oddo-Harkins rule was observed. The lanthanoid patterns in the solid samples normalized to the Leedey chondrite were similar to each other and were typical ones observed in natural rocks, having negative slopes which were especially clear in the light lanthanoids. The patterns in the water samples had more moderate negative slopes than those of the solid samples and were very close to the horizontal one. The plot of the partition coefficient, defined as the ratio of the concentration of an element in the water phase to that in the solid phase, against the ionic radius of trivalent metals was found to have a peak at about 90-95 pm, i.e., trivalent metal ions with ionic radii of 90-95 pm were most preferentially fractionated into the water phase in acidic circumstances.																			0369-4577						1993		5					543	548		10.1246/nikkashi.1993.543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/nikkashi.1993.543													WOS:A1993LD16800024
J	Benard, RB; Toft, CA				Benard, Rebecca Balogh; Toft, Catherine A.			Effect of seed size on seedling performance in a long-lived desert perennial shrub (Ericameria nauseosa: Asteraceae)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												We investigated how seed size and timing of emergence interact with environmental conditions to determine seedling performance in one population of the long-lived perennial shrub Ericameria nauseosa var. oreophila ( Asteraceae) in the sand dune ecosystem near Mono Lake, California. Size of seeds varied significantly among and within individual plants, and this variation had important consequences for size, growth, and survival of seedlings in both greenhouse and field experiments. Larger-seeded seedlings had greater biomass, greater percentage of total plant biomass allocated to roots, and longer taproots than seedlings from smaller seeds. Seedlings grown in native soil had less total biomass than seedlings grown in augmented soil but greater allocation of biomass to roots. In a field experiment following individually weighed seeds, seedlings emerging from larger seeds germinated and emerged earlier and at a higher rate than did smaller-seeded seedlings. Larger-seeded seedlings were larger at emergence, remained larger through time, and lived longer than smaller-seeded seedlings. In all stages of early seedling establishment, from germination through the first summer drought, and by all criteria, larger-seeded seedlings performed better than smaller-seeded seedlings. Given the considerable longevity of adults and the extremely small size of the wind-dispersed seeds, these aspects of seed and seedling performance have a remarkably significant impact on the survival and reproduction of subsequent life stages of E. nauseosa at this site.																			1058-5893					SEP	2007	168	7					1027	1033		10.1086/518942	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/518942													WOS:000249073400006

We present the results of taphonomic monitoring of modern vertebrate carcasses and bones from Donana National Park, a Mediterranean coastal ecosystem in Andalusia, Spain. Ten different habitats were surveyed. Half of them occur in active depositional environments (marshland, lake margin, river margin, beach and dunes). Most of the skeletal remains belong to land mammals larger than 5 kg in body weight (mainly wild and feral ungulates). Overall, the Donana bone assemblage shows good preservation with little damage to the bones, partly as a consequence of the low predator pressure on large vertebrates. Assemblages from active depositional habitats differ significantly from other habitats in terms of the higher incidence of breakage and chewing marks on bones in the latter, which result from scavenging, mainly by wild boar and red fox. The lake-margin and river-margin death assemblages have high concentrations of well preserved bones that are undergoing burial and offer the greatest potential to produce fossil assemblages. The spatial distribution of species in the Donana death assemblage generally reflects the preferred habitats of the species in life. Meadows seem to be a preferred winter habitat for male deer, given the high number of shed antlers recorded there. This study is further proof that taphonomy can provide powerful insights to better understand the ecology of modern species and to infer past and future scenarios for the fossil record.					; Martin Perea, David Manuel/I-6979-2016; Martín-Perea, David/I-6979-2016; Oliver, Adriana/L-8346-2016; cantero, ENRIQUE/AAB-6081-2020; Negro, Juan/I-2653-2015; Domingo, M./I-1614-2014	Domingo, M.

Spectral UV irradiance in the air and at several depths underwater was measured in three lakes (Lake Palosjarvi, Konnevesi, and Jyvasjarvi) with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranging from 4.9 to 8.7 mg l(-1) and chlorophyll a ranging from 1.6 to 16 mug l(-1). According to the field measurements, 99% of the UV-B radiation was attenuated in approximately a half meter water column in the clearest lake. In the UV-A region at 380 nm, the corresponding attenuation occurred in the upper one meter. In a small humic lake (DOC 13.2-14.9 mg l(-1)) U-V-B radiation was attenuated to 1% of the subsurface irradiance within the top 10 cm. water column, whereas UV-A radiation (at 380 nm) penetrated more than twice as deeply (maximum 25 cm), as predicted from the absorption coefficients. These results suggest the importance of the dissolved fraction of lake water in governing the UV attenuation in lakes. This was seen from the significant relationship between the vertical attenuation coefficients (K-d) based on field measurements and the absorption coefficients (ad) derived from spectrophotometric laboratory scannings, as well as between K-d and DOC.

Our aim was to detect actual and potential (modeled) distributions of common Erpobdellidae species, and to identify their ecological differentiation with respect to the altitudinal and waterbody type gradient. Although widespread, these species rarely live together. Intense competition is avoided by preferences for different types of habitats. This was confirmed by Pearson correlation analyses that yielded negative results. Differentiation of these species was clarified by the results of logistic Gaussian regression analyses. While Erpobdella octoculata and Dina lineata have a similar distribution along the altitudinal gradient, they prefer different waterbody types. Erpobdella vilnensis prefers higher altitudes than the other two species. Its preferred habitats are smaller rivers and streams located at altitudes from 400 to 1000 m a.s.l. Although present in all waterbody types, large lowland rivers and standing waterbodies are the preferred habitats of E. octoculata. Fast-flowing springs and streams are mostly inhabited by D. lineata. While the distribution of the species overlaps to a large degree, the ecological preferences of species differ significantly and thus they can be used as confident typological descriptors and indicators of ecological status.

J	Davies, CP				Davies, CP			Quaternary paleoenvironments and potential for human exploitation of Jordan Plateau desert interior	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												The physical, chemical, numerical, and radiometric analyses of a 31-m sediment core from the Qa'el-Jafr basin provide an important record of Quaternary paleoenvironments for the Jordan Plateau and evidence for several significant changes in climate regime. Cluster and PCA analyses of the geochemical data support the designation of major sedimentation regimes identified by stratigraphic and sediment analyses. Multiple cycles of alluvial deposition, lacustrine units, and erosional unconformities characterize the deepest sediments, followed by a period(s) of intense evaporation. Radiocarbon ages of charcoal in the uppermost 7 in place the aeolian/alluvial phase between 16,030 +/- 140 yr B.P and 24,470 +/- 240 yr B.P. Deflation processes may explain the lack of a Holocene sequence. Despite lacking radiometric ages for the lower sediments, the thickness and degree of calcium-carbonate cementation suggest considerable age for the basal sediments, which suggests that a very long terrestrial record of Quaternary climate changes has been preserved in the Jafr basin. This new record of paleoenvironments provides important context to the archaeological record of the Jordan Plateau during the Quaternary. Several archaeological surveys demonstrate extensive human exploitation of lakes and springs of the major wadis along the western margin of the Rift Valley. However, little is known of human exploitation of the desert interiors. Qa'el-Jafr sediments demonstrate significant lacustrine and high moisture phases sufficient for human exploitation of the eastern desert during the Pleistocene.

Blueback herring most likely gained entry to Lake Ontario via the Erie Barge Canal, a navigation canal that links the Mohawk-Hudson rivers, which drain to the Atlantic Ocean, to Oneida Lake, which drains to Lake Ontario through the Oneida-Oswego rivers. Blueback herring ascend the Hudson River to spawn and were first reported from the upper Mohawk River in 1978. They currently spawn in several of the upper Mohawk's tributaries, including one about 430 km from the ocean but only 25 km fp om Oneida Lake. They were first found in Oneida Lake in 1982 and, in fall 1994, large numbers of juvenile blueback herring were found moving down the Oswego River. In the southern United States, blueback herring established self-reproducing populations in several reservoirs, and thus they have the potential to colonize Lake Ontario. If blueback herring became established in Lake Ontario, they could spread to other Great Lakes and impede recovery of depressed populations of indigenous fishes, like lake herring (Coregonus artedi) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), through competition with, or predation on, their larvae.

Exploring the versatility of lotus: a comprehensive review of utilisation patterns, genetics and agronomy aspects	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) is an indigenous, aquatic-perennial with rhizomes that grow in the mud at the bottom of rivers, lakes and marshes. It is an underexploited ornamentalhaving huge potential for industrial applications in the food, textile, pharmaceutical and ornamental industry. It is an effective bioremediator in natural ponds and wetlands. It is botanically classified into three groups based on its economic use: seed lotus, rhizome lotus, and flower lotus. It is a cross-pollinated crop. Breeding methods such as hybridisation, irradiation, and molecular breeding are being used to develop improved lotus varieties . It thrives in sunlight, requires nutrient rich water, and propagated easily via seeds and rhizomes. Planting can be performed naturally in ponds and artificially in containers in the early summer months. It typically blooms from mid-July to August; however, year-round flowering can be achieved by using an artificial environment. Promotion of lotus cultivation can bring impetus income to farmers looking into the vast wetlands and open water bodies in the country. Lotus can provide sustainable livelihoods for farmers through scientific cultivation, processing, and marketing strategies. This review compiles comprehensive details on the versatile applications, genetic diversity, crop improvement, and scientific aspects of lotus cultivation.

Therefore, optimal hatching conditions for ephippial eggs originating from shallow temporary waters may differ from those found in large lakes. The aim of our study was to compare the optimal thermal conditions for hatching ephippial eggs of Daphnia found in permanent lakes and those from shallow temporary ponds. We used ephippial eggs of Daphnia from the longispina species complex originating from two temporary city ponds and two deep lakes in Poland. The ephippia were protected against overheating at all stages of the field and laboratory work to prevent activation or killing of the eggs. After a refractory period (imposed storage in cool and dark conditions), ephippia were incubated at six different temperatures (6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 A degrees C) under a 16:8 L:D light regime. Our results indicate that hatching of resting eggs of Daphnia that inhabit lakes or ponds may require different thermal conditions. The hatching success of ephippial eggs originating from temporary waters was relatively high (30-56%) at all tested incubation temperatures, while for the ephippial eggs from the deep lakes it was lower (7-37%) and inversely related to water temperature. The divergent hatching responses of the ephippial eggs originating from temporary pools and lakes may reflect the typical thermal conditions during hatching in their native habitats. While in the deep lakes of the temperate zone Daphnia hatching typically occurs during the low water temperatures of early spring, in shallow ponds Daphnia hatching may occur throughout the year at varying water temperatures, from a few to over a dozen degrees Celsius.

J	Alharbi, B				Alharbi, Basma			Remote sensing techniques for monitoring algal blooms in the area between Jeddah and Rabigh on the Red Sea Coast	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												The Red Sea is known to host and facilitate the growth and reproduction of several species of phytoplankton and algae. The degree of density and distribution of these organisms differ with region. However, very few studies have been conducted on algal blooms in this region. Hence, this study aimed to identify the effectiveness of remote sensing techniques in monitoring and controlling algal blooms in the area extending between the cities of Jeddah and Rabigh on the Red Sea coast. A series of satellite images were used to study algae from January 2020 to March 2021. All study data were subjected to processing and analysis using spectral indices [chlorophyll a (Chl-a); Concentration and Sea Surface Temperature (SST); Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI); Surface Scum Index (SSI); Surface Algal Bloom Index (SABI); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)], and the classification, overlay, and buffer methods. We found that the rate of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) increased in February 2021 and decreased in May 2020, with the algal bloom dwindling with increasing distance from the shores of the Red Sea. Furthermore, despite the varying effectiveness of the spectral indices in estimating the distribution and density of algae in the Red Sea, Landsat SSI was the most effective. One of the primary results of the study was that algal blooms more frequently occur in the winter (February). The study produced a digital map of algal blooms in the study area. Algal blooms exhibited medium inverse correlations with temperature and specific humidity, and strong direct correlation with wind speed. Valley estuaries, close to the beaches, were found to be the most suitable area for the concentration and growth of algae. The study's findings emphasize the need for close monitoring and controlling changes in the components of the marine environment using remote sensing techniques, in order to track the changes that marine plants (algae) are exposed to in the Red Sea.

Patterns of morphological changes and hybridization between sympatric whitefish morphs (Coregonus spp.) in a Swiss lake: a role for eutrophication?	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Whitefish, genus Coregonus, show exceptional levels of phenotypic diversity with sympatric morphs occurring in numerous postglacial lakes in the northern hemisphere. Here, we studied the effects of human-induced eutrophication on sympatric whitefish morphs in the Swiss lake, Lake Thun. In particular, we addressed the questions whether eutrophication (i) induced hybridization between two ecologically divergent summer-spawning morphs through a loss of environmental heterogeneity, and (ii) induced rapid adaptive morphological changes through changes in the food web structure. Genetic analysis based on 11 microsatellite loci of 282 spawners revealed that the pelagic and the benthic morph represent highly distinct gene pools occurring at different relative proportions on all seven known spawning sites. Gill raker counts, a highly heritable trait, showed nearly discrete distributions for the two morphs. Multilocus genotypes characteristic of the pelagic morph had more gill rakers than genotypes characteristic of benthic morph. Using Bayesian methods, we found indications of recent but limited introgressive hybridization. Comparisons with historical gill raker data yielded median evolutionary rates of 0.24 haldanes and median selection intensities of 0.27 for this trait in both morphs for 1948-2004 suggesting rapid evolution through directional selection at this trait. However, phenotypic plasticity as an alternative explanation for this phenotypic change cannot be discarded. We hypothesize that both the temporal shifts in mean gill raker counts and the recent hybridization reflect responses to changes in the trophic state of the lake induced by pollution in the 1960s, which created novel selection pressures with respect to feeding niches and spawning site preferences.

Franco, using naturally regenerated saplings along a wide range of light conditions. Study sites were located within a dry-summer, cool-temperate climate represented by the Dry Cool Interior Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic subzone near Williams Lake, British Columbia, Canada. In an open light environment, Pinus cortorta had a greater growth increment in both terminal and lateral shoots than did Pseudotsuga menziesii. With decreasing light availability (i) terminal increment, mean lateral increment, and total lateral increment decreased in both species (although Pinus contorta reduced lateral growth significantly faster than Pseudotsuga menziesii); (ii) the ratio of mean lateral to terminal increment in Pinus contorta did not change, but significantly increased in Pseudotsuga menziesii; (iii) the ratio of total lateral to terminal increment in Pinus contorta decreased, but increased in Pseudotsuga menziesii; and (iv) specific leaf area in both species increased (in Pseudotsuga menziesii, it was always higher and increased marginally faster than in Pinus contorta). We concluded that the less shade-tolerant Pinus contorta was less plastic in crown architecture and specific leaf area than the more shade-tolerant Pseudotsuga menziesii.					; Chen, Han/A-1359-2008	Chen, Han/0000-0001-9477-5541; 													0045-5067	1208-6037				JUL	1996	26	7					1149	1157		10.1139/x26-128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-128													WOS:A1996UY55000005

Modeling ice growth on Canadian lakes using artificial neural networks	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] This paper presents artificial neural network ( ANN) models designed to predict ice in Canadian lakes and reservoirs during the early winter ice thickness growth period. The models fit ice thickness measurements at one or more monitored lakes and predict ice thickness during the growth period either at the same locations for dates without measurements ( local ANN models) or at any site in the region ( regional ANN model), provided that the required meteorological input variables are available. The input variables were selected after preliminary assessments and were adapted from time series of daily mean air temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, solar radiation, and average snow depth. The results of the ANN models compared well with those of the deterministic physics-driven Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMO) in terms of root-mean-square error and in terms of relative root-mean-square errors. The ANN models predictions were also marginally more precise than a revised version of Stefan's law (RSL), presented herein. They reproduced some intrawinter and interannual growth rate fluctuations that were not accounted for by RSL. The performance of the models results in good part from a careful choice of input variables, inspired from the work on deterministic models such as CLIMO. ANN models of ice thickness show good potential for the use in contexts where ad hoc adjustments are desirable because of the limited availability of measurements and where poor data nature, availability, and quality precludes using deterministic physics-driven models.

The elevation and chronology of these shoreline features can be used to reconstruct lake level fluctuation history and regional paleo-climate. Here, we report optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of 14 sediment samples from three of seven paleo-shorelines at south of Dagze Co, central Tibetan Plateau, using coarse-grained quartz and K-feldspar. Two fine grain silt samples were also measured. The results suggest the following: 1) The highest paleo-shoreline for Dagze Co has an elevation around 4,525 m (+55 m above modern lake). Its age is estimated to be 9.1 +/- 0.5 to 9.6 +/- 0.6 ka, suggesting a relative humid condition in the early Holocene. 2) After that, the lake level dropped similar to 20 m and remained relatively stable (+35 m) from similar to 8 to 5 ka, implying a dry condition with reduced runoff. Lake level further declined for similar to 40 m since about 5 ka. 3) The general trend of shrinkage for Dagze Co broadly matches studies from adjacent lakes, suggesting a common pattern of lake's evolution on the south/central plateau in the late Quaternary. The long-term decreasing trend of Asian monsoon precipitation should be the main reason.					cui, hao/P-2709-2017; Ding, Ping/H-1817-2015; Chen, Yiwei/AGY-7204-2022; Cui, Hao/P-2709-2017; Wu, Yang/AAE-3272-2019	Cui, Hao/0000-0002-9417-5068; 														2296-6463				JUL 11	2022	10								940013	10.3389/feart.2022.940013	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.940013													WOS:000833898300001

Diversity, Composition and Environmental Relations of Periphytic Rotifer Assemblages in Lentic Freshwater Bodies (Flanders, Lower Belgium)	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Periphytic rotifer assemblages from lentic habitats are understudied. To improve knowledge on the principal environmental determinants of their structure and composition, we examined summer periphyton from 184 freshwater bodies from a taxonomic and multi-trait-based perspective. Only the latter allowed consideration of all bdelloids. Alpha diversity decreased with electrolyte and aluminium concentration but increased with macrophyte richness, pointing at salinization, metal toxicity and loss of structural niche heterogeneity as potential threats for rotifer diversity. Replacement was the prominent component of beta diversity, with acidified sites showing the highest local contributions. Variation partitioning indicated that local conditions explained variation in species composition best, but general setting (soil type, land cover, connectivity) and spatial context were also not insignificant. Redundancy analysis related species composition more particularly to gradients of pH and trophic status, whereas the representation of functional groups was structured mainly by phytoplankton productivity. Mirroring shifts observed in the plankton, high phytoplankton productivity associated with larger size and more detritibacterivory. Dominance of collectors constrained variation in guild ratios, underlining the need for more refined functional approaches. To aid the use of periphytic rotifers in regional water quality assessment, we identified indicators and community thresholds for pH and trophic variables and determined optima and tolerances for individual taxa.					; De Smet, Willem/C-3458-2008	/0000-0002-1841-6579; 														1424-2818				DEC	2023	15	12							1214	10.3390/d15121214	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15121214													WOS:001135967300001
J	Townsend, SA; Boland, KT; Luongvan, JT				Townsend, SA; Boland, KT; Luongvan, JT			Wet and dry season heat loss in two tropical Australian reservoirs	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The influence of the wet/dry tropical climate on the seasonal heat pattern for two Australian water bodies is examined. The heat content and volume-weighted mean temperature: of the reservoirs (Darwin River Reservoir, DRR; Manton River Reservoir, MRR) were computed for an eight year period which included wet seasons of very high and low rainfall. Because of the large Volume changes of the two water bodies and dependence of heat content on volume, volume-weighted mean temperature was a better parameter to assess the heat pattern of DRR and MRR. The surface energy budget for DRR, in common with other tropical water bodies, was primarily controlled by net radiation and evaporative energy fluxes. Both reservoirs experienced two annual temperature minima and maxima in most years. The water bodies reached minimum annual temperatures (22-25 degrees C) in the cool, dry season (June-August), then gained heat rapidly during the dry-wet transition (August-October). In December, temperatures reached 31-32 degrees C. During most wet seasons (January, February), monsoon weather caused significant heat loss, leading to a second temperature minimum of 27-30 degrees C. Subsequent heat gain increased temperatures to 30-32 degrees C in March. When monsoon weather was brief, however, neither reservoir experienced significant wet season cooling, resulting in a single annual minimum and maximum temperature. Between April and June reservoir heat loss was most rapid due to reduced shortwave radiation and increased evaporative energy fluxes. The seasonal heat pattern of DRR and MRR is compared to other water bodies exposed to a tropical climate comprising of distinct high and low rainfall seasons. Minimum annual temperatures and heat contents of DRR and MRR coincided with the hemispheric winter, as experienced by nearly all tropical lakes. No single seasonal heat pattern, however, is representative of these tropical climates, due to variable influences of advective and surface heat fluxes, though two annual temperature and heat content maxima and minima is most common.																			0003-9136					MAR	1997	139	1					51	68																WOS:A1997WY31400004

This study assessed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CS evolution from 1990 to 2030 using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, Patch-generating Land Use Simulation, and Grey Multi-objective Optimization Programming models in the Xiong'an New Area. Subsequently, structural equation model was used to explore the driving mechanisms between the influencing factors and CS. The following results were obtained: (1) Between 1990 and 2020, the trend of CS in the Xiong'an New Area showed a fluctuating "decrease-increase-decrease" pattern, and the CS reached a minimum in 2020. The distribution of CS also showed spatial heterogeneity. A reduction in cropland area was the main factor contributing to a lower CS. (2) Under different development scenarios, the CS change in the Xiong'an New Area in 2030 was generally characterized by "rising in the north and falling in the south". Baiyang Lake and its surrounding areas played a key role in maintaining the stability of CS. (3) Economic growth, areas away from railways, and lower population densities had positive impacts on CS, while increases in altitude and temperature had negative impacts on CS. Moreover, the intensities of their impacts changed under different development scenarios. The results of the study can help support the optimization of LULC patterns and the formulation of sustainable development strategies in the Xiong'an New Area.																			0959-6526	1879-1786				JAN 5	2025	487								144622	10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144622		JAN 2025											WOS:001394295700001

Arsenate Adsorption by Unsaturated Alluvial Sediments	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Arsenic can occur naturally in excess of drinking water standards. Earlier a field-scale recharge pond experiment in the Antelope Valley ground water basin, Mohave Desert, California, was performed to determine the effectiveness of naturally occurring minerals in the unsaturated zone to treat high As water. The extent to which the remediation can be continued on any site is unknown and depends on the As adsorption properties and capacity of the sediments. Therefore, arsenate adsorption reactions as a function of solution As concentration and solution pH were investigated on five alluvial sediments obtained from various depths of a borehole adjacent to the recharge pond. Arsenate adsorption increased with increasing solution pH, exhibited a maximum around pH 4 to 5, and then decreased with increasing pH. The constant capacitance model was able to fit arsenate adsorption on the sediments as a function of solution As concentration and solution pH. A general regression model was used to predict arsenate surface complexation constants from routinely measured chemical parameters. The predicted arsenate constants were used to predict adsorption on the sediments, thereby providing a completely independent evaluation of the ability of the model to describe arsenate adsorption. The prediction equations were able to satisfactorily predict arsenate adsorption on one of the five sediments whose chemical properties fell into the range for the set of soils used to develop the prediction equations. Equimolar phosphate concentrations did not affect the extent of arsenate adsorption indicating that the extent of arsenate remediation by the sediments will be unaffected by the low amounts of native phosphate.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				MAY	2013	77	3					782	791		10.2136/sssaj2012.0322	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2012.0322													WOS:000322082400010

Surface Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) ranged from 1277 to 1849 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), and the euphotic zone, generally deeper than the mixed layer, varied between 28 m and 49 m. We found a strong photoinhibiting effect of high PAR and UV-A at surface levels, whereas UV-B radiation (< 320 nm) had low extra contribution in the photosynthesis inhibition. As a consequence, cell numbers, Chl a and primary production rates of both fractions increased towards deep layers in all lakes. The photosynthetic efficiency (Chl-specific production per photon unit) of both fractions increased with depth, although this increase was higher in PicoPhy, indicating a higher fitness to low-light. The per cent contribution of PicoPhy production to total production, showed an inverse significant relation with total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Moreover our data fitted the existing database showing a significant trend towards a decrease of PicoPhy biomass and an increase of its relative contribution to total biomass with decreasing trophic state. At very low-phosphorus concentration, typical of north Patagonian lakes, we found good evidence of the competitive advantage of PicoPhy. Low-light and low TDP may interact to create the most favourable conditions for the smaller photosynthetic organisms. In conclusion, we found that at low-light and very low nutrient regime PicoPhy achieves higher photosynthetic efficiency than the larger autotrophic organisms.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2007	41	4					511	523		10.1007/s10452-007-9125-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-007-9125-z													WOS:000250578100002
J	EFFORD, IE				EFFORD, IE			TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY IN MARION LAKE BRITISH COLUMBIA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												As shown by the C14 method, the primary productivity of phytoplankton in Marion Lake, a small shallow coastal lake, was very low and was concentrated almost entirely in the 5-mo. period June to Oct. Even on the sunniest days, productivity of the surface was not inhibited in contrast to results from most freshwater and marine studies. No explanation could be given. Measurements made simultaneously at 0.5 m at 20 stations covering the lake showed a trend to lower productivity as the water flowed from the inlet to the outlet except when the water passed a large spring. Here productivity increased, suggesting that nutrients were definitely limiting productivity. There was a close relationship between productivity and temperature but not between productivity and light. This suggested that the water temperature prevents full utilization of the available light energy and nutrients during 7 mo. of the year. The average productivity under a sq. m. of lake surface was estimated as only 8 g C/m2 per year, and efficiency of conversion of available sun''s energy to plant material as only 0.0009%. The low efficiency reflected the very low concentrations of nutrients in the lake water, the high flushing rate, and the low water temperature during 7 mo. of the year.																									1967	24	11					2283	+		10.1139/f67-186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-186													WOS:A1967A169600005

Reconstructions of past lake-level change and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), as well as activation and abandonment of outlets, is dependent on an understanding of the elevation of the lake at each outlet. More than 100 years of study has established the gross elevation of the Nipissing phase at each outlet, but the mixing of geomorphic and sedimentologic data has produced interpreted outlet elevations varying by at least several meters. Vibracore facies, optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon age control, and ground-penetrating radar transects from new and published studies were collected to determine peak Nipissing water-level elevations for the Port Huron (Lake Huron), Chicago (Lake Michigan), and Sault (Lake Superior) outlets. Contemporary elevations are 183.3, 182.1, and 195.7 m (International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 [IGLD85]), respectively. These data and published relative hydrographs were combined to produce one residual hydrograph for the Port Huron outlet that best defines the rise, peak, and rapid fall of the Nipissing phase from 6000-3500 calendar years ago. Establishing accurate elevations at the only present-day unregulated outlet of the Great Lakes and the only ancient outlet that has played a critical role in draining the upper Great Lakes since the middle Holocene is a critical step to better understand GIA and water-level change geologically and historically. The geologic context may provide the insight required for water managers to make informed decisions to best manage the largest freshwater system in the world.					; Thompson, Todd/G-6579-2011	Thompson, Todd/0000-0001-6266-2630; 													0072-1077		978-0-8137-2508-6				2014	508						15	29		10.1130/2014.2508(02)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2014.2508(02)	10.1130/9780813725086												WOS:000342837200003

The uncertain search for the diffuse silver bullet: science, policy and prospects	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The overwhelming importance of diffuse sources as a determinant of receiving water quality has been recognised for over 30 years. Significant research and development on techniques for reducing inputs in the riparian zone has resulted in numerous guideline documents being produced. Yet despite this research effort, and the apparently successful transfer of key results to water resource managers, the public perception in New Zealand is that the quality of receiving waters continues to decline. In this paper we examine the veracity of that perception through examination of state-of-the-environment reporting, discussions with water resource managers, and published literature. Using a case study of Lake Taupe, New Zealand as an example, we discuss the difficulties faced by water resource managers in arresting declines in water quality. We compare the reduction in potential nutrient exports possible between 'non-invasive' mitigation techniques such as riparian buffer strips, constructed and natural wetlands and source control measures such as the use of nitrification inhibitors and wintering pads. Finally, we look at options available should voluntary measures or best management practices fail to deliver the nutrient reductions that are necessary to maintain lake water quality.																			0273-1223						2007	56	1					199	205		10.2166/wst.2007.452	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2007.452								17711016					WOS:000248734900024

Environmental significance of mid- to late Holocene sapropels in Old Man Lake, Coorong coastal plain, South Australia: An isotopic, biomarker and palaeoecological perspective	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The Holocene successions of numerous shallow lakes located along the Coorong coastal plain in South Australia attest to the impact of rising sea level and changing climate on their depositional environment. Old Man Lake is one of the smallest perennial alkaline lakes in the region. Its succession comprises a basal lagoonal sand rich in humic organic matter (OM) overlain by a 3.7 m thick upward shoaling lacustrine mudstone. The latter features three discrete sapropel units deposited between 3270 and 4910 cal yr BP, a time of increasing aridity throughout southeastern Australia. A core taken from the lake's eastern margin yielded sedimentological, mineralogical, geochronological and micropaleontological data. Coring at five other sites across the lake provided sections of the humic and sapropelic facies (n = 20) for total organic carbon and Rock-Eval analysis; isotopic characterization of their micritic carbonate (delta C-13(carb), delta O-18(carb)) and co-existing OM (delta C-13(org)); and GC-MS and GC-irMS analysis of their free aliphatic hydrocarbons. For each 'sapropel event' high productivity of diatoms and green algae was the principal driver of the accumulation and preservation of OM in such high concentrations. The precursor algal blooms were likely triggered by the influx of fresh water following winter rainfall. The combination of kerogen hydrogen index and delta C-13(carb)-delta C-13(org), previously employed to track secular changes in algal productivity and organic preservation, proved useful in identifying synchronous geographic differences in these processes across the lake. Highly branched isoprenoids (HBI: C-25:1 >> C-20:0) are prominent components of the aliphatic hydrocarbons in the sapropels, confirming the significant contribution of diatoms to their OM. The C isotopic signatures of the principal C-25:1 HBI isomer and the co-occurring C-23-C-31 odd carbon numbered n-alkanes further document the non-uniformity of biomass preservation within and between the three sapropel units. The evidence from this study suggests that seasonal algal blooms and meromixis, although not necessarily an anoxic hypoliminion, were required for sapropel formation in the Holocene lakes of the Coorong region. Higher resolution sampling, dating and comparative analysis (microfossil, biomarker and isotopic) of these sapropels is required to clarify their potential significance as palaeoclimate proxies.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												The distribution of freshwater fish is influenced by food availability, habitat heterogeneity, competition, predation, trophic state, and presence/absence of macrophytes. This poses a challenge to monitoring, and researchers have been struggling to develop accurate sampling methods for obtaining a better understanding of fish communities. We compare fish community composition, richness, and diversity in 56 Danish lakes using data obtained by gillnetting in different lake zones and near-shore electrofishing, respectively. On average, electrofishing captured more species than offshore gillnets, but not more than littoral gillnets. Overall, the different fish sampling methods showed consistency as to fish community structure, but noticeable differences in community-environment relationships. Lake area was the best predictor for fish species richness in the littoral samplings, while it was poor for offshore samplings. Electrofishing was more efficient than gillnets at catching pike (Esox lucius), eel (Anguilla anguilla), and tench (Tinca tinca), whereas pelagic gillnets were better for catching pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) and perch (Perca fluviatilis). Independently of methods, the total number per unit of effort and weight per unit of effort were generally positively related to summer chlorophyll a, and, for offshore nets, negatively related to average depth. Our results show that sampling restricted to specific habitats within the lakes does not provide a representative of the whole-lake fish community, as all methods miss some important species that other methods capture. However, electrofishing seems to be a fast alternative to gillnets for monitoring fish species richness and composition in littoral habitats of Danish lakes.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Menezes, Rosemberg/V-1695-2017; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Menezes, Rosemberg/0000-0001-9949-8221; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2013	710	1					47	59		10.1007/s10750-012-1025-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1025-0													WOS:000318170200005

Formation of ring marks in stocked tilapia juveniles (Oreochromis aureus/O-niloticus) (Perciformes: Cichlidae)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Lake Metztitlan was dried Lip completely in the spring of 1998 and refilled in August of that year. In the period September-November, two cohorts of 1.6 million juveniles of a tilapia hybrid were stocked (Oreochromis aureuslO. niloticus), and monitored every month for one year. Since the date of birth of these juveniles was known, the analyses focused on whether the ring marks of the scales, sagittae and opercula or the circuli of the scales Could he used to age them. The ring marks of the scales and opercula showed great variability, and the sagittae had a significant relationship with length, but it is unclear if at least the first ring mark could be formed at the hatchery and reflect changes in diet and/or tank movements in the Fish farm. The circuli had a continuous regular behavior, with a formation rate of 10.38 +/- 0.93 and 11.38 +/- 0.95 circuli/month for the First and second cohorts, respectively. This proportion was maintained during the study period, and could be of help to calculate an approximate age of juveniles, especially in stocked fish that show multiple ring marks because of manipulation in fish farms and stocking events.																			0034-7744	2215-2075				SEP-DEC	2007	55	3-4					1005	1013											19086402					WOS:000250013500023
J	Sarnelle, O; Knapp, RA				Sarnelle, O; Knapp, RA			Zooplankton recovery after fish removal: Limitations of the egg bank	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Allee effect, operating via mate limitation, theoretically reduces the probability of recovery from local extinction of dioecious zooplankton relative to species that can reproduce asexually. We removed fish from four alpine lakes in the Sierra Nevada in which both Hesperodiaptomus shoshone (a calanoid copepod) and Daphnia middendorffiana were historically present but had become locally extinct after fish stocking. After complete fish removal, D. middendorffiana returned to all four lakes, whereas H. shoshone failed to return in any of the lakes, despite diapausing eggs observed in the sediments of two lakes and a few individuals in the water column of one lake during the first summer after fish removal. We estimated the potential magnitude of the Allee effect, as it may have affected the recovery of H. shoshone, by comparing estimates of minimum founding population size of H. shoshone with estimates of actual founding population sizes of D. middendorffiana. It took 4 yr for D. middendorffiana to recover to detectable levels in one of the four lakes, which we suggest was the result of a very small founding population. The latter was three to four orders of magnitude smaller than the minimum founding population size we calculated for H. shoshone, indicating the potential for a large effect of mate limitation on the copepod's ability to recover. H. shoshone might never return to these lakes without human intervention because of the combined effects of mate limitation and low rates of overland dispersal.

Liquid water is found at the surface only in lakes and in the temporary streams that feed them. Past geophysical exploration has yielded ambiguous results regarding the presence of subsurface water. In 2011, we used a helicopter-borne, time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) sensor to map resistivity in the subsurface across the Dry Valleys. The airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method excels at finding subsurface liquid water in polar deserts, where water remains liquid under cold conditions if it is sufficiently saline, and therefore electrically conductive. Over the course of 26 h of helicopter time, we covered large portions of the Dry Valleys and vastly increased our geophysical understanding of the subsurface, particularly with respect to water. Our data show extensive subsurface low-resistivity layers approximately 150-250 m below the surface and beneath higher resistivity layers. We interpret the low-resistivity layers as geologic materials containing freeze-concentrated or "cryoconcentrated" hyper saline brines lying beneath glaciers and frozen permafrost. These brines appeared to be contiguous with surface lakes, subglacial regions, and the Ross Sea, which could indicate a regional-hydrogeologic system, wherein solutes might be transported between surface reservoirs by ionic diffusion and subsurface flow. The presence of such brines underneath glaciers-might have implications for glacier movement. Systems such as this, where brines exist beneath glacial ice and frozen permafrost, may exist elsewhere in coastal Antarctica; AEM resistivity is an ideal tool to find and survey them. Our application of TDEM demonstrates that in polar subsurface environments containing conductive brines, such a diffusive electromagnetic method is superior to radar surveying in terms of depth of penetration and ability to differentiate hydrogeologic conditions.

Microbial food web components, bulk metabolism, and single-cell physiology of piconeuston in surface microlayers of high-altitude lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Sharp boundaries in the physical environment are usually associated with abrupt shifts in organism abundance, activity, and diversity. Aquatic surface microlayers (SML) form a steep gradient between two contrasted environments, the atmosphere and surface waters, where they regulate the gas exchange between both environments. They usually harbor an abundant and active microbial life: the neuston. Few ecosystems are subjected to such a high UVR regime as high altitude lakes during summer. Here, we measured bulk estimates of heterotrophic activity, community structure and single-cell physiological properties by flow cytometry in 19 high-altitude remote Pyrenean lakes and compared the biological processes in the SML with those in the underlying surface waters. Phototrophic picoplankton (PPP) populations, were generally present in high abundances and in those lakes containing PPP populations with phycoerythrin (PE), total PPP abundance was higher at the SML. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were also more abundant in the SML. Bacteria in the SML had lower leucine incorporation rates, lower percentages of "live" cells, and higher numbers of highly-respiring cells, likely resulting in a lower growth efficiency. No simple and direct linear relationships could be found between microbial abundances or activities and environmental variables, but factor analysis revealed that, despite their physical proximity, microbial life in SML and underlying waters was governed by different and independent processes. Overall, we demonstrate that piconeuston in high altitude lakes has specific features different from those of the picoplankton, and that they are highly affected by potential stressful environmental factors, such as high UVR radiation.

J	Biondic, B; Biondic, R; Measki, H				Biondic, Bozidar; Biondic, Ranko; Measki, Hrvoje			The conceptual hydrogeological model of the Plitvice Lakes	GEOLOGIA CROATICA												The Plitvice Lakes National Park, founded in 1949, is located in the central part of the Dinaric karst region in Croatia. Large karst springs and 16 lakes separated by tufa barriers and waterfalls are the fundamental natural phenomenon of the national park, which has a million visitors a year. Lakes are recharged by water from the mountainous region of Lika, and the runoff is directed towards the Black Sea catchment. The whole area of the National park is composed of carbonate rocks with different levels of natural permeability and very complex tectonic relationships, which allowed discharge of groundwater, maintaining the lake and finally partial loss of water to the karst underground after passing through the lake system. Proscansko and Kozjak are the two largest lakes which dominate and by their internal dynamics ensure maintenance of the high water quality of the whole system. A conceptual hydrogeological model of the Plitvice Lakes was the result of complex research in the framework of international cooperation between the University of Zagreb and the Joanneum Research Institute in Graz. The research identified completely new data about the genesis of the water system, the hydrogeological characteristics of the karst water catchment, the dynamics of the water in the lakes, locations of water loss from the Plitvice Lakes system, the "hanging" position of Lake Kozjak in relation to groundwater and a whole range of other data important for the preservation and protection of water resources in the National Park. Throughout the project were made 3022 measurements of different physico-chemical parameters, 7885 of the chemical analysis of water and 1082 analysis of stable isotopes.

In this work, we analyzed sediment denitrification patterns across the shore zone of Lake Taihu and explored their underlying mechanisms using flooding simulation experiments. The results showed that denitrification mainly occurred in the upper sediment layer (0-10 cm) and the denitrification rate was highest at the land-water interface (6.2 mg N/m(2)h), where there was a frequent rise and fall in the water level. Denitrification was weaker in the lakebed sediments (4.6 mg N/m(2)h), which were inundated long-term, and in the sediments of the near-shore zone (2.3 mg N/m(2)h), which were dried out for extended periods. Flooding simulation experiments further indicated a strong positive relationship between sediment denitrification rate and flooding frequency. When the flooding occurred once every 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 days, the denitrification rate reached 7.6, 5.7, 2.8, 0.9, and 0.6 mg N/m(2)h, respectively. Frequent flooding caused alternating anoxic and aerobic conditions in sediments, accelerating nitrogen substrate supply and promoting the growth and activity of denitrifying bacteria. Based on these findings, we propose a possible strategy for enhancing sediment denitrification by manipulating the water level, which can help guide nitrogen removal in lakeshore zones.					; kong, lingwei/AAD-9667-2019; wenqing, shi/JCO-4345-2023	Kong, Lingwei/0000-0001-6759-6580; 														2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	23							3323	10.3390/w13233323	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13233323													WOS:000734609900001

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In spring 2011, an unprecedented flood hit the complex eastern United States (U.S.)-Canada transboundary Lake Champlain-Richelieu River (LCRR) Basin, destructing properties and inducing negative impacts on agriculture and fish habitats. The damages, covered by the Governments of Canada and the U.S., were estimated to C$90M. This natural disaster motivated the study of mitigation measures to prevent such disasters from reoccurring. When evaluating flood risks, long-term evolving climate change should be taken into account to adopt mitigation measures that will remain relevant in the future. To assess the impacts of climate change on flood risks of the LCRR basin, three bias-corrected multi-resolution ensembles of climate projections for two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios were used to force a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, distributed hydrological model. The analysis of the hydrological simulations indicates that the 20-year return period flood (corresponding to a medium flood) should decrease between 8% and 35% for the end of the 21st Century (2070-2099) time horizon and for the high-emission scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. The reduction in flood risks is explained by a decrease in snow accumulation and an increase in evapotranspiration expected with the future warming of the region. Nevertheless, due to the large climate inter-annual variability, short-term flood probabilities should remain similar to those experienced in the recent past.					; Ricard, Simon/HGB-8704-2022	Ricard, Simon/0000-0002-3049-8933; Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750													1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2021	57	1					32	56		10.1111/1752-1688.12891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12891		OCT 2020											WOS:000583753000001

However, our knowledge of the habitat use and migration tactics of hatchery-bred F2 Chinese sturgeon is poor, as is our understanding of the effects of releasing these hatchery-bred sturgeon on the natural population. Acoustic telemetry data and recapture information were therefore collected to study the seaward migration behavior and distribution of hatchery-bred juvenile F2 Chinese sturgeon. Acoustic monitoring showed that the released F2 juveniles dispersed gradually and migrated down the Yangtze River at a ground migration speed of 24.2-125.9 km/day (mean 88.5 km/day). The range of swimming depths used by the F2 Chinese sturgeon during downstream migration depended on the river reaches considered, but the mean depth was 10.4 m (range 0.2-32.3 m). It was found that F2 Chinese sturgeon juveniles prefer to swim in the middle and upper layers of the water. Twenty-one of the 61 (34%) acoustically tagged F2 juveniles arrived at the estuary area. Recapture information indicated that the cultured F2 Chinese sturgeon adopted a similar distribution strategy to the wild Chinese sturgeon larvae in the estuary area. Knowledge of the migration and distribution patterns of the hatchery-bred juvenile F2 Chinese sturgeon should help to illuminate the consequences of restocking the natural population of Chinese sturgeon with cultured F2 juveniles, and thus point the way to an effective protection strategy for this species in the Yangtze River.

Further, the petrography, sedimentology, chronology, and elemental geochemistry of the calcareous tufa were studied and analyzed. The results show the following. (1) The Sparkling Lake calcareous tufa profile was deposited under the background of a warm and humid climate during the Holocene. The growth pattern follows a bottom-to-top deposition. (2) At 750 +/- 30-300 +/- 30 aB.P., the calcareous tufa layers were gray-black as a whole, and the changes in mineral composition and elemental geochemistry indicate a fluctuating upward trend for temperature and precipitation during this period. (3) The formation of two sets of black peat layers in the upper part of the tufa calcareous profile is due to the synergistic action of multiple factors caused by strong tectonic activity. In conclusion, the deposition mechanism of the calcareous tufa in Jiuzhaigou was controlled by paleoclimate hydrology and glaciation for a long time, while strong tectonic activity over a short period of time considerably changed the color, structure, element content, and mineral composition of the calcareous tufa.

J	Rouwet, D; Tassi, F				Rouwet, Dmitri; Tassi, Franco			Geochemical monitoring of volcanic lakes. A generalized box model for active crater lakes	ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS												In the past, variations in the chemical contents (SO42-, Cl-, cations) of crater lake water have not systematically demonstrated any relationships with eruptive activity. Intensive parameters (i.e., concentrations, temperature, pH, salinity) should be converted into extensive parameters (i.e., fluxes, changes with time of mass and solutes), taking into account all the internal and external chemical-physical factors that affect the crater lake system. This study presents a generalized box model approach that can be useful for geochemical monitoring of active crater lakes, as highly dynamic natural systems. The mass budget of a lake is based on observations of physical variations over a certain period of time: lake volume (level, surface area), lake water temperature, meteorological precipitation, air humidity, wind velocity, input of spring water, and overflow of the lake. This first approach leads to quantification of the input and output fluxes that contribute to the actual crater lake volume. Estimating the input flux of the "volcanic" fluid (Q(f) - kg/s) - an unmeasurable subsurface parameter - and tracing its variations with time is the major focus during crater lake monitoring. Through expanding the mass budget into an isotope and chemical budget of the lake, the box model helps to qualitatively characterize the fluids involved. The (calculated) Cl-content and delta D ratio of the rising "volcanic" fluid defines its origin. With reference to continuous monitoring of crater lakes, the present study provides tips that allow better calculation of Q(f) in the future. At present, this study offers the most comprehensive and up-to-date literature review on active crater lakes.

Niloshini; Babaluk, John A.; Power, Geoff; Reist, James D.; Power, Michael			Summer habitat use and feeding of juvenile Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, in the Canadian High Arctic	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Owing to limited knowledge of the habitat use and diet of juvenile Arctic charr from the High Arctic, particularly young-of-the-year (YOY), we assembled data obtained from samples taken in and around Lake Hazen, Nunavut, Canada, to assess juvenile habitat use and feeding. Juvenile charr demonstrated a preference for stream environments, particularly those fed by warm upstream ponds. Charr occupying both stream and nearshore lake habitats were found to feed similarly, with chironomids occurring most frequently in diets. Some older stream-dwelling charr preyed on smaller, younger Arctic charr. Preferred stream occupancy is likely mediated by physical barriers created mainly by water velocity, and by distance from the lake, lake-ice dynamics, low water depth, and turbidity. Water velocities resulted in stream habitat segregation by size, with YOY mainly found in low-velocity pools and back eddies adjacent to stream banks, but not in water velocities >0.1 m(.)s-1. Greatest charr densities in streams were found in small, shallow, slow-flowing side channels, which are highly susceptible to drought. Under predicted climate change scenarios, streams fed by small ponds will be susceptible to intermittent flow conditions, which could result in increased competition among juvenile charr for the remaining stream habitats. In addition, glacier-fed streams are likely to experience increased flow conditions that will exacerbate physical barriers created by water velocity and further reduce the availability of preferred stream habitat.																			0906-6691					APR	2012	21	2					309	322		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00552.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00552.x													WOS:000301282400016
J	Gabriel, AO; Bodensteiner, LR				Gabriel, AO; Bodensteiner, LR			Historical changes in mid-water stands of common reed in the Winnebago pool lakes, Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Despite the tolerance of common reed grass to environmental extremes, mid-water stands in the Winnebago pool lakes of central Wisconsin appear to be diminishing. Formerly occupying shoreline locations, water level manipulations subsequent to dam construction beginning in the 1850's have isolated reed stands off shore. These stands have persisted but casual observations indicate that stand size has been declining. To address this perception we obtained an approximately decadal series of aerial photographs dating back to 1937 for four stands in Lake Poygan. Annual records were available for 1986-94. Using image analysis software, we determined shape and size metrics. Changes in stands varied widely, with areal losses ranging from 2% to 94%. The perimeter showed corresponding losses. Perimeter to area ratio and number of patches indicate that stand loss is characterized by increased fragmentation and shrinking patch size. The pattern of loss appears to proceed through an increase in irregularities along the perimeter, especially along edges facing the summer prevailing winds. This process exposes more of a patch to wind and wave action and eventually results in a division of the patch, culminating in periodic losses of the smallest patches. Despite an overall decrease in stand size, changes in size varied among the years of record with limited recovery occurring during some years.																			0270-5060					DEC	2002	17	4					563	573		10.1080/02705060.2002.9663934	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2002.9663934													WOS:000180470900008

We studied the occurrence of ciliate epibionts on crustacean zooplankton in nine German lakes with different limnological features during the summer of 2011. We also measured the detachment and re-attachment rates of the ciliates, changes in their motility, and the feeding rates of attached vs. detached ciliate epibionts. Epibionts were found in all lakes sampled except an acidic lake with large humic inputs. Epibiont prevalence was as high as 80.96% on the cladoceran Daphnia cucullata, 67.17% on the cladoceran Diaphanosoma brachyurum, and 46.67% on the calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus gracilis. Both cladoceran groups typically had less than 10 epibionts per individual, while the epibiont load on E. gracilis ranged from 1 to >30 epibionts per individual. After the death of the zooplankton host, the peritrich ciliate epibiont Epistylis sp. detached in an exponential fashion with a half-life of 5 min, and 98% detached within 30 min, leaving behind the stalks used for attachment. Immediately after detachment, the ciliates were immotile, but 62% became motile within 60 min. When a new host was present, only 27% reattached after 120 min. The average measured ingestion rate and clearance rate of Epistylis were 11,745 bacteria ciliate(-1) h(-1) and 24.33 mu l ciliate(-1) h(-1), respectively. Despite their high feeding rates, relatively low epibiont abundances were observed in the field, which suggests either diversion of energy to stalk formation, high metabolic loss by the epibionts, or high mortality among the epibiont populations.

The Tivoli travertines have been traced sideways from the core into wire-cut surfaces well exposed in nearby active quarries. They normally appear well bedded and show erosional-non depositional discontinuities, recurring at a centimetric to metric-decametric scale and show a variable penetration by younger sediments (Ca-carbonates as well as reddish soils), as evidenced by their karstic and/or pedogenetic features. The microstratigraphic and sedimentologic analysis has revealed a number of lithofacies grouped in three associations, suggesting environmental domains spanning from gentle slope to shallow lake. This sedimentary organization and stable isotope (O, C) analyses carried out at cm scale have allowed to recognize a hierarchy of higher to lower frequency cycles. On these bases, it is argued and proposed that the higher frequency cyclicity is due to water table fluctuations, as a consequence of millennial-scale climatic changes that in turn may be linked to the solar perturbations (short-term cycles). The lower frequency, instead, cycles (metres to decametres in thickness) suggest medium-term (sub-Milankovitch) and longer term, precession-driven (Milankovitch) periodicities. These conclusions are supported by the correlation of the hierarchical organization of the travertine cycles with a number of radiometrically dated discontinuity surfaces outcropping along the quarry walls and traceable into the borecore. This correlation allows the cyclostratigraphic analysis to be constrained into late Quaternary geochronology and fits well within the precession and obliquity periodicities, as predicted for this time interval.

The mesotrophic, dimictic lakes are important recreational fishing sites for both warm-water bass and cold-water trout. To improve summertime cold-water habitat for trout in NT, dissolved oxygen (DO) addition to the hypolimnion, using liquid oxygen as an oxygen gas source, started in 2009. This study assessed mercury (Hg) in the water column, zooplankton and fish, and related water quality parameters, in Twin Lakes from 2009 to 2012. Because methylmercury (MeHg) buildup in lake bottom water is commonly associated with hypolimnetic anoxia, hypolimnetic oxygenation was hypothesized to reduce Hg in bottom waters and biota in NT relative to ST. Oxygen addition led to significantly higher DO (mean hypolimnetic DO: 2-8 mg/L versus <1 mg/L) and lower MeHg (peak mean hypolimnetic MeHg: 0.05-0.2 ng/L versus 0.15-0.4 ng/L) in North Twin. In North Twin, years with higher DO (2009 and 2011) exhibited lower MeHg in bottom waters and lower total Hg in zooplankton, inferring a positive linkage between oxygen addition and lower bioaccumulation. However, when comparing between the two lakes, Hg levels were significantly higher in zooplankton (total Hg range: 100-200 versus 50-100 mu g/kg dry weight) and trout (spring 2010 stocking cohort of eastern brook trout mean total Hg: 74.9 versus 49.9 mu g/kg wet weight) in NT relative to ST. Lower Hg bioaccumulation in ST compared to NT may be related to bloom dilution in chlorophyll-rich bottom waters, a vertical disconnect between the location of zooplankton and MeHg in the water column, and high binding affinity between sulfide and MeHg in bottom waters.

Computational experiments on the 1962 and 1970 landslide events at Huascaran (Peru) with r.avaflow: Lessons learned for predictive mass flow simulations	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Mass flow simulations are considered important tools for hazard analysis. For the simulation of single process mass flows such as debris flows, robust tools and reasonable parameter range estimates are available. However, this is much less the case for more complex mass flows, e.g. involving process chains and flow transformation. We explore the challenges of simulating complex flow-dominated landslides by back-calculating the Huascaran events of 1962 and 1970 with r.avaflow, a two-phase mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2012) in a GIS-based open source simulation framework. Both events started as rock-ice falls on the western slope of the north summit of Nevado Huascaran (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) and entrained large volumes of glacial till at lower elevation, resulting in highly mobile debris avalanches. Whereas the 1962 event badly affected the village of Ranrahirca when spreading over a debris cone, the 1970 event overtopped a ridge and led to the complete destruction of the town of Yungay. Well documented in the literature, these events provide an opportunity as a natural laboratory for testing innovative mass flow simulation tools and their features. In a first step, we consider (i) the 1962 event and (ii) the 1970 event separately, for each of them optimizing the key input parameters in terms of empirical adequacy. In a second step, we apply the optimized parameter set for (i) to the 1970 event and the parameter set derived for (ii) to the 1962 event. In a third step, we explore the sensitivity of the model outcomes to selected key parameters (basal friction angle and entrainment coefficient). The results (a) demonstrate the general ability of r.avaflow to reproduce the spatio-temporal evolution of flow heights and velocities as well as travel times and volumes of these complex mass flow events reasonably well; and (b) highlight the challenges and uncertainties involved in predictive simulations with parameter sets obtained from back-calculations. We suggest a strategy to appropriately deal with uncertain outcomes by superimposing the results of multiple simulations. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Berry			The effects of high meltwater on the limnology of Lake Fryxell and Lake Hoare, Taylor Valley, Antarctica, as shown by dissolved gas, tritium and chlorofluorocarbons	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Small changes in the availability of liquid water can have profound effects on the water levels, aqueous chemistry and biogeochemical dynamics of the closed-basin, perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. We have compiled the published and unpublished data on dissolved gas, tritium and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for Lake Fryxell and Lake Hoare to determine the effects of a high meltwater year (2001-02 summer) on the lakes. The dissolved gas, tritium and CFC data indicate that the pulse of freshwater that flowed onto the surfaces of the lakes did not mix extensively with the upper water column. At the bottom of Lake Hoare, the measurable CFC and lower dissolved gas values suggest that the recent meltwater may have mixed with bottom waters. The probable mechanism for this transportation is weak density currents with c. 0.1-1.5% surface water being transported downwards in Lake Hoare. This deep water input, while not constant, may have a significant effect on the chemistry of the bottom waters in Lake Hoare over time. In Lake Fryxell, the tritium and CFC data indicate that the recent meltwater did not significantly affect the bottom water chemistry; therefore, weak density currents may not be present in Lake Fryxell.																			0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2014	26	4					331	340		10.1017/S095410201300062X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095410201300062X													WOS:000339377300002

Influence of the Wax Lake Delta sediment diversion on aboveground plant productivity and carbon storage in deltaic island and mainland coastal marshes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coastal Louisiana is experiencing a significant loss of coastal wetland area due to increasing sea level rise, subsidence, sediment starvation and marsh collapse. The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of >50 km(-2) y(-1). The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Taylor, MP; Drysdale, RN; Carthew, KD				Taylor, MP; Drysdale, RN; Carthew, KD			The formation and environmental significance of calcite rafts in tropical tufa-depositing rivers of northern Australia	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Spring-fed rivers of the Barkly karst in tropical northern Australia form an array of tufa and related freshwater carbonate deposits. One of these deposits, calcite rafts, is precipitated at the water-air interface principally as a consequence of CO2 degassing and evaporation. Calcite rafts have been reported in cave environments but have not been described in detail from fluvial systems. Observations using scanning electron microscopy coupled with water chemistry data reveal that they form by a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes. They grow downwards into the water column and form a dentate lower surface, while a flat upper surface occurs at the water-air interface. The rafts are readily inhabited by microorganisms, particularly diatoms, which frequently become entombed by calcite as the rafts develop. The decay of the biological material leaves voids, creating a pock-marked texture. The rafts are subject to secondary calcite growth along the crystal edges. Once they become submerged in the water column after disturbance of the water surface, they may become completely covered by this overgrowth, creating a homogeneous veneer. The rafts form in quiescent settings, principally behind tufa dams in large, lake-like water bodies along each river. Therefore, they can be used in conjunction with adjacent exposures of other tufa facies to decipher palaeohydrological conditions. Although the rafts are extremely thin and fragile, they are readily preserved within fossil waterhole facies, and their occurrence has been identified in rocks from the Quaternary to the Tertiary.					; Drysdale, Russell/AAH-9376-2019	Taylor, Mark Patrick/0000-0001-7598-9982; Drysdale, Russell/0000-0001-7867-031X													0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2004	51	5					1089	1101		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2004.00661.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2004.00661.x													WOS:000224024800008

This study estimated spatial-temporal changes and relationships in hydro-climate and vegetation dynamics in the basin. Studying the spatial-temporal variation between vegetation dynamics and hydro-climate in this basin is essential for assessing climate change and sustainability. This research involved an examination of the mean yearly air temperature, overall annual rainfall, fluctuations in river discharge, vegetation cover, and alterations in vegetation types within the selected basin stations. This was accomplished through the utilization of hydro-meteorological analysis, satellite assessment, land cover determination, and statistical analysis. Over the course of the study, it was observed that the average annual air temperature increased at all stations (with a positive change of Z = +1.16). The amount of precipitation decreased (Z = -0.79), especially from 2000 to 2014, and its statistical significance decreased. During the study period, average river discharge significantly decreased (Z = -3.51). Due to these combined factors, the lake's water level also decreased (Z = -2.03). Vegetation cover change varied in high mountains, near river and lake water surfaces, and in arid regions. Changes in air temperature and precipitation in the current year determine vegetation cover. Because of the large amount of precipitation in the summer months from 2000 to 2010 and 2020, the growth of vegetation cover during that period was relatively good. This study was conducted in arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and demonstrates the impact of climate change on changes in vegetation cover.

Known for its famous steatite sculptures and clay pottery, the first settlement in Konar Sandal collapsed around 3rd millennium BCE. A second shorter, but major phase of occupation in the settlement occurred towards the end of 2nd millennium BCE. A 250-cm long peat sequence near the archaeological complex at Konar Sandal was investigated to reconstruct the human environment history using palynological, sedimentological and geochemical data. With a basal age of 4 ka, the core traces the hydroclimatic changes and human activities that started just after large scale abandonment of Konar Sandal and extends from the late Bronze Age to the Mongol invasion. The results show that Jiroft had an arid dry climate dominated by the Saharo-Sindian open pseudo-savanna vegetation. However, due to human clearance and intensified agro-sylvo-pastoral activities, and climatic factors, the land-cover shifted from open xeric scrublands to a more open degraded landscape. The principal human occupation was cereal cultivation and herding. However, it is likely that during the more arid periods, communities retreated and abandoned agriculture, facilitating successional processes. Such droughts occurred around 4.0-3.8 ka and 3.4-2.8 ka and are related to the Siberian Anticyclonic system. Declining Artemisia and shrubs indicate milder climates ca. 3.8-3.4 ka and 2.8-0.6 ka. The latter period that started with the rule of the Persian empires (550-650 BCE), and continued through the Islamic era, coincides with intensive human activities, and the highest degradation of vegetation.

An even larger area has been affected by groundwater lowering. The specific characteristics of catchments disturbed by lignite mining are presented for the Schlabendorf/Seese region, where a close relation between water issues and open-cast lignite mining exists. In general, this relationship starts prior to mining and persists even after the land is reclaimed. The most obvious feature of this post-mining landscape is the large number of forming post-mining lakes. A further feature is the recovery of the groundwater table. Dry streams and springs now are starting to flow again, and areas with a formerly deep groundwater table are now directly influenced by rising groundwater. The disturbance causes various acidification phenomena. The aeration of pyrite-bearing material leads to a drastic deterioration of the groundwater quality, which affects receiving streams and lakes. Thus there is the tendency for some parts of post-mining lakes to become acid. Additionally, in the marginal areas of the groundwater recovery, acidification of streams occurs, causing water quality problems in ponds and lakes located downstream. The development of each individual water body with respect to water quantity and quality depends on its specific hydrogeological and hydrological setting.

J	Skwierawski, A				Skwierawski, Andrzej			THE USE OF THE INTEGRATED TROPHIC STATE INDEX IN EVALUATION OF THE RESTORED SHALLOW WATER BODIES	ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING A-CHEMIA I INZYNIERIA EKOLOGICZNA A												The aim of this study was to determine the trophic status of five restored shallow lakes from a group of 30 water bodies in the Olsztyn Lakeland, which were dried in the 19th century as part of a land reclamation program. The effectiveness of the Integrated Trophic State Index (ITS) in the evaluation process was analyzed. ITS is a relatively new method for diagnosing eutrophication intensity. It analyzes the balance between production processes and organic matter decomposition through simultaneous measurements of oxygen saturation and pH of water. ITS is a versatile tool which can be applied in various types of water bodies. In this study, it was used to evaluate shallow water bodies characterized by excessive phosphorus loads and susceptibility to blue-green algal blooms in summer. During a three-year study carried out in 2010-2012, significant correlations were observed between %O-2 and pH, which is a basic prerequisite for applying the ITS method. In the analyzed water bodies, correlation coefficients were determined in the range of r = 0.68-0.83. ITS values varied in successive years ITS (from 7.73 to 8.67), ranging from eutrophy to hypertrophy. Most ITS scores were consistent with the values of Carlson's TSI, which indicates that used integrated trophic state index, based on the values of water pH and oxygen saturation, accurately reflect the ecological status of degraded water bodies.

This situation has created a unique opportunity to study the way that rivers have responded to these changes. Here, the impact of these reductions on concentrations of nutrients (N and P) at 22 sampling sites on Estonian rivers are examined. There were statistically significant downward trends (one-sided test at the 5% level) in total nitrogen (TN) concentrations at 20 of the 22 sites. These decreases in TN relate to: (i) substantial reductions in the use of organic and inorganic fertilisers, (ii) reduction of cultivated and ploughed areas and increased proportions of grassland and abandoned land and (iii) improvements in farm management practices. For total phosphorus (TP), significant downward trends were detected at only two sites, and there were also two upward trends. The TP trends can be mainly explained by changes in phosphorus discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants. Fifteen downward trends and one statistically significant upward trend were found for the TN:TP ratio. The general decline in this ratio has likely been conducive to blue-green algae blooms in the recipient, Lake Peipsi. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In each of the three lake systems, which differ in pH and trophic state, some sequence types were found without related sequences (sequence identity <90%) in the data sets from the other two systems. Two sequences in the Actinomycetes and Verrucomicrobia radiations were more closely related to sequences from the New York: lakes data set than to any other sequence in the global databases. However, the most striking similarities were found in the subdivisions alpha and beta of the Proteobacteria. In these subdivisions three different clusters of highly related bacteria were identified (97-100% sequence identity) that were represented in all three lake regions. The clusters contained no members other than freshwater bacteria. One cluster falls within a monophyletic aquatic supergroup that apparently diverged early in evolution into an exclusive freshwater cluster and an exclusive marine cluster, the so-called SAR11 cluster. The detection of these three bacterial clades in lakes distinguished by geographic distance as well as physical and chemical diversity suggests that these organisms are dispersed globally and that they possess unique functional capabilities enabling successful competition in a wide range of freshwater environments.

Though the tephra layers can be grouped by source (Glacier Peak, Mount Mazama, Mount Saint Helens, and unknown source), statistical analyses of both glass and mineral compositions show that finer distinctions within a group (for example, Glacier Peak B, M, and G) cannot be made on the basis of chemical data obtained using conventional EMP techniques. It appears that more-sensitive analytical techniques may be needed to discriminate among the Glacier Peak tephras. Tephra stratigraphy at the various sites reveals a potentially greater complexity in Glacier Peak tephra distributions and ages than was anticipated. All sites, except Sheep Mountain Bog and East Wenatchee, contained two Glacier Peak tephras. Taken as a whole the Glacier Peak tephra layers may record closely timed, multiple eruptions with restricted ash falls as well as widespread tephra from large eruptions. Radiocarbon dating generally confirms a C-14 age of 11 200 years BP for a distal Glacier Peak couplet(s) that occurs, stratigraphically, both above and below Mount Saint Helens J tephra in east-central Washington.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				MAR	1993	30	3					535	552		10.1139/e93-042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e93-042													WOS:A1993LM39100013

INLAND WATERS												Phytoplankton bioindicators were used to assess environmental conditions in urban aquatic systems in a large Canadian city. Sampling was conducted during summers 2010 and 2011 in 20 urban waterbodies on the Island of Montreal (Quebec, Canada). We evaluated 4 indicators: (1) fluorometric estimates of the chlorophyll concentration of the total phytoplankton and of 4 spectral groups, (2) species richness, and (3) biovolumes of taxonomic and (4) functional groups of the microphytoplankton. We assessed how these indicators changed among types of urban waterbodies and determined the limnological features and/or management practices driving their spatial variation. Principal component analysis captured 48% of total environmental heterogeneity, and K-means clustering analyses defined 5 relevant types of waterbodies. Overall, 96 microphytoplankton species (gamma diversity) were recorded, and species richness (alpha diversity) per waterbody varied from 1 to 27. Chlorophyll concentration of the total phytoplankton and the green algae spectral group, as well as the total biovolume of microphytoplankton, dinophytes, and of 2 functional groups (large flagellates, large colonies of green algae, and cyanobacteria) differed among waterbody types. Phytoplankton indicators based on in situ fluorometry and microphytoplankton biovolume of functional and taxonomic groups were fairly coherent and showed potential for monitoring. Implications of our findings are discussed in light of guiding future management practices to sustain biodiversity, ecological integrity, and water quality of urban waterbodies.					; Levesque, David/W-8683-2019; Giani, Alessandra/H-9764-2012; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/U-9107-2019	Levesque, David/0000-0001-7532-0146; Giani, Alessandra/0000-0002-2524-8534; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/0000-0002-1070-2968; , El-Amine/0000-0001-8291-4663													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2020	10	1					71	88		10.1080/20442041.2019.1678970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2019.1678970		JAN 2020											WOS:000512546700001

The generation of DP data at scale creates novel challenges for the histopathology community in managing, processing, and governing the use of these data. The current understanding of, and confidence in, the legal and ethical aspects of DP by pathologists is unknown. We developed an electronic survey (e-survey) comprising of 22 questions, which was developed with input from the Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) Digital Pathology Working Group. The e-survey was circulated via e-mail and social media (Twitter) through the RCPath Digital Pathology Working Group network, RCPath Trainee Committee network, the Pathology image data Lake for Analytics, Knowledge and Education (PathLAKE) digital pathology consortium, National Pathology Imaging Co-operative (NPIC), local contacts, and to the membership of both The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland and the British Division of the International Academy of Pathology (BDIAP). Between 14 July 2020 and 6 September 2020, we collected 198 responses representing a cross section of histopathologists, including individuals with experience of DP research. We ascertained that in the UK, DP is being used for diagnosis, research, and teaching, and that the platform is enabling data sharing. Our survey demonstrated that there is often a lack of confidence and understanding of the key issues of consent, legislation, and ethical guidelines. Of 198 respondents, 82 (41%) did not know when the use of digital scanned slide images would fall under the relevant legislation and 93 (47%) were 'Not confident at all' in their interpretation of consent for scanned slide images in research. With increasing uptake of DP, a working knowledge of these areas is essential but histopathologists often express a lack of confidence in these topics. The need for specific training in these areas is highlighted by the findings of this study.					; Aslam, Muhammad/E-6354-2015	Mckay, Francis/0000-0002-3177-9446; Colling, Richard/0000-0001-6344-9081; Macklin, Philip/0000-0002-7750-3242														2056-4538				MAR	2022	8	2					101	115		10.1002/cjp2.251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cjp2.251		NOV 2021						34796679					WOS:000720236900001

The coast was deglaciated prior to similar to 12200 C-14 BP (14300 cal BP), and herbaceous tundra vegetation invaded the area. Midge-inferred maximum summer surface-water temperatures in the lake ranged between 9 and 11 degrees C. Subsequent gradual warming to similar to 18 degrees C by 10800 C-14 BP (12725 cal BP) favoured the migration of a variety of herbaceous and shrub taxa into the region. Rapid cooling to similar to 10 degrees C saw vegetation revert to herbaceous tundra communities. This interval, related to the Younger Dryas cold interval of the North Atlantic and Europe, lasted until similar to 10000 C-14 BP (11630 cal BP). The climate then warmed again to conditions similar to those that prevailed immediately before onset of Younger Dryas cooling. Further warming saw successive tree species migrate into the area until, by the mid-Holocene, the forests contained most of the taxa prevalent today. Since similar to 3500 years ago, cooling of the climate has favoured conifer species over broad-leaved taxa. Agriculture and logging practices in the last 150 years have altered the forest composition, but pollen analysis of the most recent sediments cannot resolve these changes adequately.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	2009	46	9					637	650		10.1139/E09-034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E09-034													WOS:000270491400001

Chronic and Episodic Acidification of Adirondack Streams from Acid Rain in 2003-2005	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Limited information is available on streams in the Adirondack region of New York, although streams are more prone to acidification than the more studied Adirondack lakes. A stream assessment was therefore undertaken in the Oswegatchie and Black River drainages; an area of 4585 km(2) in the western part of the Adirondack region. Acidification was evaluated with the newly developed base-cation surplus (BCS) and the conventional acid-neutralizing capacity by Gran titration (ANC(G)). During the survey when stream water was most acidic (March 2004), 105 of 188 streams (56%) were acidified based on the criterion of BCS < 0 mu eq L-1, whereas 29% were acidified based on an ANC(G) value < 0 mu eq L-1. During the survey when stream water was least acidic (August 2003), 15 of 129 streams (12%) were acidified based on the criterion of BCS < 0 mu eq L-1, whereas 5% were acidified based on ANC(G) value < 0 mu eq L-1. The contribution of acidic deposition to stream acidification was greater than chat of strongly acidic organic acids in each of the surveys by factors ranging from approximately 2 to 5, but was greatest during spring snowmelt and least during elevated base flow in August. During snowmelt, the percentage attributable to acidic deposition was 81%, whereas during the October 2003 survey, when dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were highest, this percentage was 66%. The total length of stream reaches estimated to be prone to acidification was 718 km out of a total of 1237 km of stream reaches that were assessed.					; Baldigo, Barry/C-4095-2013	Baldigo, Barry/0000-0002-9862-9119; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2008	37	6					2264	2274		10.2134/jeq2008.0061	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2008.0061								18948480					WOS:000260941800029

According to the results from the LMR v2.0, six severe decadal droughts occurred in ACA during the last 530 years and five of them overlap with the results based on the independent reconstructions of Asian summer precipitation, such as the droughts of 1519-1538 CE, 1545-1561 CE, 1621-1658 CE, 1822-1846 CE, and 1964-1983 CE. The climate anomaly patterns are characterized by opposite anomalies between the high-latitude and midlatitude Eurasia during the first four well-agreement droughts, with negative precipitation and positive surface level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies located over midlatitude Eurasia and opposite anomalies over high-latitude Eurasia. Whereas, during the last well-agreement drought, opposing pattern of the climate variation observed between in ACA and in the Mediterranean with negative precipitation anomalies and positive 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies in ACA and opposite anomalies in the Mediterranean. The positive Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation influence is found to dominate the droughts of 1621-1658 CE via a northward migration of the westerlies. While the last drought of 1964-1983 CE produced by the combined impacts of the negative Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation via the Silk Road pattern over the midlatitude Eurasian continent.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 16	2021	126	5							e2020JD033409	10.1029/2020JD033409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033409													WOS:000629772000015

High contaminant loads in Lake Apopka's riparian wetland disrupt gene networks involved in reproduction and immune function in largemouth bass	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS												Lake Apopka (FL, USA) has elevated levels of some organochlorine pesticides in its sediments and a portion of its watershed has been designated a US Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site. This study assessed reproductive endpoints in Florida largemouth bass (LMB) (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) after placement into experimental ponds adjacent to Lake Apopka. LMB collected from a clean reference site (DeLeon Springs) were stocked at two periods of time into ponds constructed in former farm fields on the north shore of the lake. LMB were stocked during early and late oogenesis to determine if there were different effects of contamination on LMB that may be attributed to their reproductive stage. LMB inhabiting the ponds for similar to 4 months had anywhere from 2 to 800 times higher contaminant load for a number of organochlorine pesticides (e.g. p, p'-DDE, methoxychlor) compared to control animals. Gonadosomatic index and plasma vitellogenin were not different between reproductively-stage matched LMB collected at reference sites compared to those inhabiting the ponds. However, plasma 17 beta-estradiol was lower in LMB inhabiting the Apopka ponds compared to ovary stage-matched LMB from the St. Johns River, a site used as a reference site. Sub-network enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to reproduction (granulosa function, oocyte development), endocrine function (steroid metabolism, hormone biosynthesis), and immune function (T cell suppression, leukocyte accumulation) were differentially expressed in the ovaries of LMB placed into the ponds. These data suggest that (1) LMB inhabiting the Apopka ponds showed disrupted reproduction and immune responses and that (2) gene expression profiles provided site-specific information by discriminating LMB from different macro-habitats.

Chloride concentration in the stream has increased by over an order of magnitude during the 23 yr since the highway was opened, and chloride concentration in the lake has tripled. Road salt moves to the lake primarily via the contaminated stream, which provides 53% of all the chloride to the lake and only 3% of the total streamflow to the lake. The stream receives discharge of salty water from leakage through the diversion berm. Uncontaminated ground water dilutes the stream downstream of the berm. However, reversals of gradient during summer months, likely caused by transpiration from deciduous toes, result in flow of contaminated stream water into the adjacent ground water along the lowest 40-m reach of the stream. This contaminated ground water then discharges into the lake along a 70-m-wide segment of lake shore. Road salt is pervasive in the bedrock between the highway and the lake, but was not detected at all of the wells in the glacial overburden. Of the 500 m of shoreline that could receive discharge of saly ground water directly from the highway, only a 50-m-long segment appears to be contaminated.

As a means of overcoming this problem, a small number of studies have used biogenic surface films as synoptic flow tracers, under the assumption that biofilm streaklines are tangent to the local flow direction. Here we rigorously test this assumption and show that, despite flow patterns that change severely in space and time (over a range >270 degrees), streaklines are relatively accurate synoptic flow tracers for the Wax Lake Delta, in Louisiana. When the incoming discharge was greater than 2400 m(3)/s with stable or falling tides, the streakline-derived flow direction departed from near bed flow direction measurements of 22.8 degrees (root mean square). When the discharge was greater than 2400 m(3)/s and the tides were rising greater than 0.03 m/hr, they were accurate within 28.0 degrees. Under conditions of discharge less than 2400 m(3)/s and tidal change less than a positive 0.03 m/hr, they were accurate within 33.3 degrees, while during low discharge and rising tides they were accurate within 58.9 degrees. Accuracy varied with distance from the delta, with proximal sites having greater precision. Our results demonstrate that a streakline-derived flow direction can characterize the spatiotemporal variability in the flow directions, but that the accuracy is significantly influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions and location within the network.

J	Bateman, MD; Murton, JB; Crowe, W				Bateman, MD; Murton, JB; Crowe, W			Late Devensian and Holocene depositional environments associated with the coversand around Caistor, north Lincolnshire, UK	BOREAS												Sand deposits described at three sites near Caistor, north Lincolnshire (UK), provide a record of Late Devensian (Late Weichselian) to Holocene palaeoenvironments at the western margin of the European sand belt. Thermoluminescence (TL) and radiocarbon analyses provide for the first time a chronological framework for the demise of proglacial Lake Humber and the onset of coversand deposition. The reconstructed palaeoenvironmental history suggests that proglacial Lake Humber had receded from its initial high-level stand before c. 18 ka, exposing the lake floor to periglacial conditions marked by the development of thermal contraction cracks. In the period between c. 18 and 14 ka, sand-depositional processes changed from dominantly fluvial to aeolian. The fluvial activity was possibly a consequence of ameliorating winter climates between c. 17 and 16 ka. The aeolian coversand deposition in this period has not been previously recognized in Britain and correlates with the Older Coversand II and Younger Coversand I deposits elsewhere in the European sand belt. Feat accumulation followed during the Windermere (Bolling/Allerod) Interstadial and early part of the Loch Lomond Stadial (Younger Dryas) before regionally extensive coversand deposition took place in the later part of the Loch Lomond Stadial. This coversand correlates with the widespread Younger Coversand II deposits found both within the UK and across the European sand belt. The Holocene has been characterized by widespread stability with the development of soils on the coversand punctuated with periods of localized reworking through to the present day.						bateman, mark/0000-0003-1756-6046; Murton, Julian/0000-0002-9469-5856													0300-9483					MAR	2000	29	1					1	15																WOS:000086023300001
J	Laybourn-Parry, J; Quayle, W; Henshaw, T				Laybourn-Parry, J; Quayle, W; Henshaw, T			The biology and evolution of Antarctic saline lakes in relation to salinity and trophy	POLAR BIOLOGY												Five brackish to hypersaline lakes (Highway, Ace, Pendent, Williams and Rookery) in the Vestfold Hills, eastern Antarctica were investigated during the austral summer of 1999/2000. The aims were to characterise the functional dynamics of the plankton and gain an understanding of how the different environments in the lakes have led to the evolution of different communities. The plankton was dominated by microorganisms and differed across the salinity spectrum in relation to trophy, age and the presence of meromixis. However, some elements of the plankton were common to all of the lakes, e.g. the mixtrophic ciliate, Mesodinium ruhrum, which reached abundances of 2.7 x 10(5) l(-1) and spanned a salinity gradient of 4-63parts per thousand. Marine dinoflagellate species also occurred in all of the lakes, often at high abundances in Highway Lake, Pendent Lake and Lake Williams. During December (midsummer), primary production showed an increase along the salinity gradient from Highway Lake to Lake Williams; however, it was low in hyper-nutrified Rookery Lake because of the turbidity of the waters. Bacterial production followed the same trend and was extremely high in Rookery Lake (327 mug l(-1) h(-1) in January). The lakes possessed a marine microbial plankton that has become very simplified through time, and now contains a small number of highly successful species, which were pre-adapted to surviving in extreme Antarctic lakes.

J	CHAMIER, AC				CHAMIER, AC			EFFECT OF PH ON MICROBIAL-DEGRADATION OF LEAF LITTER IN 7 STREAMS OF THE ENGLISH-LAKE-DISTRICT	OECOLOGIA												Rates of degradation of alder, oak and grass leaf packs with associated microbial populations were measured in seven streams pH 6.8-4.9. Streams were chosen from upland and lowland sites of the same river for contrasts in pH, water chemistry and riparian vegetation. The most important factor governing rates of degradation is the physical and chemical nature of the leaf material. At pH 6.8 rates of degradation, ''k'', and microbial colonization were higher than at pH .ltoreq. 5.5: ''k'' on alder x6; on oak x2; on grass x2. At lowland sites, pH 6.8, higher decay rates were associated with high levels of microbial colonization including c. 14 spp of aquatic hyphomycete fungi - regardless of riparian vegetation. Decay rates were similar at upland sites, pH 6.8 and 6.6, involving high levels of colonization by fewer fungal species and fewer bacteria - regardless of riparian vegetation - though grass was barely degraded at upland sites of any pH. At pH .ltoreq. 5.5, slow decay rates were associated with low levels of microbial colonization and few fungal species. Largest microbial populations at low pH associated with riparian trees did not lead to markedly increased decay rates. Factors of water chemistry at low pH appear to inhibit microbial metabolism. The implications of these findings for stream invertebrates active in the winter is discussed.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				MAR	1987	71	4					491	500		10.1007/BF00379287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00379287								28312217					WOS:A1987G245400003
J	Hajnal, E; Padisák, J				Hajnal, Eva; Padisak, Judit			Analysis of long-term ecological status of Lake Balaton based on the ALMOBAL phytoplankton database	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Balaton (Hungary), one of the largest lakes in Europe, has undergone eutrophication and restoration during the last two decades. The first quantitative phytoplankton records date back to the 1930s, and since that time thousands of data have been published or accumulated in counting protocols or computer sheets. These data provide material for both scientific analyses (e.g. effects of global change) and applications (e.g. estimation of reference state for the Water Framework Directive). The ALMOBAL phytoplankton database was developed to provide computing support for these applications. It stores data in standardized forms, handles synonyms and allows analyses to be conducted on the basis of floral records, numbers or biomass. The analysis includes records of about 3000 phytoplankton samples taken during the past 60 years from two representative basins in Lake Balaton. This article represents the first attempt at historical reconstruction of the ecological status and compares it with changes in trophic state and current water quality. The results indicate that the phytoplankton biomass and community structure found in the early 1960s could be regarded as reference conditions. Statistical analyses support the view that late summer phytoplankton assemblages are the most sensitive indicators of trophic change, and clearly show the eutrophication of the lake that occurred from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s and the restoration during the last decade. An additional advantage is that, since quality estimation is based on relative biomass, the method can be used to reconstruct water quality in cases when counting protocols are available, but some basic data for quantitative estimates are missing.

J	Schabetsberger, R; Grill, S; Hauser, G; Wukus, P				Schabetsberger, Robert; Grill, Susanne; Hauser, Gabriele; Wukus, Petra			Zooplankton successions in neighboring lakes with contrasting impacts of amphibian and fish predators	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Two pairs of neighboring subalpine lakes located in the Northern Calcareous Alps of Austria were investigated. Each pair comprised a deeper lake containing European minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus), and a corresponding shallower lake harboring Alpine newts (Triturus alpestris) as top predators. Plankton successions within fish and amphibian lakes differed markedly from each other. Throughout the year rotifers numerically dominated within the minnow lakes, while pigmented copepods (Genera Heterocope, Acanthodiaptomus, Arctodiaptomus, Mixodiaptomus) and Daphnia were prominent in the amphibian lakes, at least early during the ice-free period. We argue that size-selective predation by minnows was the ultimate reason for this predominance of smaller zooplankton. While one of the minnow lakes was characterized by a succession of spatially and temporally segregated rotifer species, the other minnow lake permitted the development of populations of small-sized Bosmina and Ceriodaphnia during summer, probably due to the existence of a strong oxycline allowing zooplankton crustaceans to avoid predation from shore-based shoals of minnows. Once trout were introduced into this lake, minnows were visibly reduced in abundance. Bosmina and Ceriodaphnia disappeared and Daphnia together with a predacious copepod (Heterocope) emerged either from egg banks or arrived from nearby source populations. We argue that the crustacean communities within the fishless lakes were adapted to the comparatively weak predation rates of Alpine newts.

The streams, ponds, and lakes up to 10(4) m2 in area occur in two types of terrain systems with differing morphological, chemical, and biological characteristics: pinnacled ice (PI) areas with sparse sediment cover, low relief, and little biomass; and ice-cored moraine (ICM) areas with 10-20 cm sediment cover, hummocky topography with up to 20 m relief, occasional mirabilite deposits, and dense benthic cyanobacterial mats. Pond water composition in the two areas is markedly different. PI area melt waters have low salinities, < 2270 mg l-1 total dissolved salts (TDS), and near neutral pH, mean = 7.8. The chemical composition of PI waters closely follows that of diluted sea water, suggesting that the release of ions from the sea ice matrix of the ice shelf is the major solute source. In contrast, ICM area melt waters have a wide range of salinities, up to 60 400 mg l-1 TDS and alkaline pH, mean = 9.3. The chemical composition in c. 40% of the ICM ponds investigated did not resemble that of sea water, but had higher relative abundances of SO42-, Na+, K+ and Ca2+. Leaching of local salt deposits, particularly mirabilite, weathering of surficial sediments, and morphological features promoting closed-basin brine evolution are possible contributing factors to the enrichments.																			0954-1020					MAR	1994	6	1					17	27																WOS:A1994NA19100003

Fish farming and other anthropogenic activities from 1994-2001 triggered the harmful blooms. Nine years after the cessation of aquaculture, a conversion from problematic species (Alicrocystis spp. Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) to the less problematic species P. limnetica and other associated non-cyanobacteria taxa was recorded. Through this period of change, trophic factors (bottom-up) were re-examined, and correlations between cHABs and selected environmental variables were observed. Higher temperatures, nutrients [total nitrogen (TN). total phosphorus (TP)] and available light significantly favored the development of Microcystis spp blooms. With declining nutrient loads, and a decline in TP relative to TN there was a competitive shift from Microcystis summer blooms to the growth of Pseudanabaena limnetica and other non-cyanobacteria. Pseudanabaena limnetica was favored over Microcystis spp when temperatures were <20 degrees C and TP was <0.03 mg L-1. The apparent species succession to P. limnetica was enhanced by a competitive advantage under varied light conditions. Multiple environmental and biotic conditions (not always nutrients) were driving cHABs. Although only a selected number of environmental variables were examined. the CCA analysis supports observations that temperature and nutrients were associated with the species shift. The replacement of cHABs with the growth of less toxic cyanobacteria like P. limnetica. and other algae creates an interesting scenario (new community condition) for the removal of problematic taxa in reservoir systems. Diverting or controlling blooms will have direct implications on water quality and economic remediation initiatives in reservoir and lake management.

Mountain lakes are numerous in this region, and could be regarded as possible sentinels of hydro-climatic changes, using appropriate modelling tools able to simulate the lake-climate relation. We present a detailed study of Lake Azigza, based on a 4-year (2012-2016) observation period, including lake level measurements, isotope analyses of precipitation, lake and spring waters, and local meteorological data. The approach is based on a calibration of a daily time-step lake water and isotope mass balance model, fed by precipitation and evaporation rates, to estimate the ungauged components of the water balance. Results show the dominance of groundwater exchanges in the lake water balance, with significant interannual variations related to annual precipitation. At the annual time-step, groundwater inflow varies between twice and up to six times the amount of direct precipitation, while the groundwater loss reached up to five times evaporation. However, a significant decrease of groundwater loss is observed in 2016, suggesting that a threshold effect probably limits the seepage when the lake level decreases. This study underlines the importance of groundwater fluxes in the lake level variations for Lake Azigza, probably representative of many similar lakes in the Middle Atlas. The model was able to simulate the continuous lake level decrease (4 m) observed over 2012-2016 and can be further used to explore lake-climate relations at different timescales.					; Vidal, Laurence/C-1860-2019; Adallal, Rachid/AAP-4577-2021; Sonzogni, Corinne/AAG-5816-2019	Vallet-Coulomb, Christine/0000-0001-5898-1516; Rhoujjati, Ali/0000-0002-8176-7451													1436-3798	1436-378X				DEC	2019	19	8					2697	2709		10.1007/s10113-019-01566-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01566-9		NOV 2019											WOS:000499019600002

Climatic variability of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and western US snowpack	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study examines the changing characteristics of snow water equivalent (SWE) in western United States and their teleconnections with large-scale variability of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This study evaluated the relationship among sea surface temperatures (SST), 500-mbar geopotential height (Z(500)), 500-mbar east-west wind (U-500), and western United States SWE (1 March, 1 April, and 1 May). The averages of SST, Z(500), and U-500 were computed to create a lead time of 2-10 months. Three different 6-month series were computed - January-June, April-September, and July-December - and were correlated with SWE stations in the western United States. The study utilized singular-value decomposition (SVD) for a period of 1961-2016 to correlate the SWE and climate indices. SVD was applied between the standardized SST and SWE to obtain their correlation and to evaluate connection with Z(500) and U-500 within the same SVD relationship. Specifically, SVD was not applied independently on each variable prior to this study. The correlations were observed to increase as the lead time decreased. First mode SVD showed a pronounced non-El Nino-Southern Oscillation short-wave train for the July-December climate in the Z(500) data; this terminated over the Great Lakes region, and was strongly correlated with the warming of the SST near the east coast of Japan, resulting in decreased SWE in the study area. Second mode SVD showed a negative correlation between SWE stations in Colorado and Utah and SST near the Asian and Australian continents. The associations between climate indices and SWE that were identified during this study could be used to improve long-term forecasts, resulting in better management of water resources in the region.					; Ahmad, Sajjad/A-2867-2008; Kalra, Ajay/H-5652-2019	Miller, William/0000-0002-6116-0919; Kalra, Ajay/0000-0003-3878-2346; Ahmad, Sajjad/0000-0002-9903-9321													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAR 15	2018	38	3					1257	1269		10.1002/joc.5241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5241													WOS:000426729300011

Flow cytometry, widely used in biomedical research, allows fast counting and optical analysis of individual particles. Organic autotrophic particles contain naturally fluorescing pigments, such as chlorophyll and phycoerythrin. Different populations have different sizes and pigments. They also have different ratios of pigments. In general, side angle scatter (SSC) is related to the size, shape and refractive index of particles. When a 488 nm wavelength was used to excite chlorophyll and phycoerythrin fluorescence, the pigments of organic autotrophic particles emitted red and orange light. Fine particles were detected by flow cytometry (FCM) in the southern part of a eutrophic lake in winter. We found that organic autotrophic particles belonged to three populations, which represented only 15.89% of total fine particles. Organic nonliving particles and inorganic particles represented the greater part (84.11%) of total fine particles. This study also demonstrated that flow cytometry is well suited to the dynamic monitoring and analysis of natural water aquatic particles that were difficult to study with traditional methods.

First observations and early life-history aspects of lake rearing galaxiid larvae in the lower Waikato River Basin, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Larval behaviour for many of New Zealand's diadromous freshwater fish is inadequately described. Diadromy for many amphidromous species is not obligatory however, and where conditions are suitable, freshwater larval rearing may be facilitated. Where this occurs in lakes, opportunities to document the composition and conditions supporting larval rearing exist. Boat trawling was undertaken across nine lowland lakes in the Lower Waikato over four consecutive winters with a focus on larval galaxiids. Galaxiid larvae were captured in surface water habitats in all but one lake, with banded kokopu (Galaxias fasciatus) and giant kokopu (Galaxias argenteus) the most common species detected. One lake, Lake Waahi, consistently resulted in the most galaxiid captures for effort expended. Analyses of larvae from this and other lakes indicated that two sizes predominated in catches and that larger, older larvae were predominantly G. fasciatus while smaller, younger larvae were predominantly G. argenteus. Stomach contents indicated that two non-native zooplankton species predominated in the diet of larvae, the Holarctic daphnia, Daphnia galeata, and the Australian calanoid copepod Boeckella symmetrica. This study provides new information regarding the timing, movement and predicted recruitment of native fish species in this river basin that has important implications for lake and river management.

Dry conditions disrupt terrestrial-aquatic linkages in northern catchments	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Aquatic ecosystems depend on terrestrial organic matter (tOM) to regulate many functions, such as food web production and water quality, but an increasing frequency and intensity of drought across northern ecosystems is threatening to disrupt this important connection. Dry conditions reduce tOM export and can also oxidize wetland soils and release stored contaminants into stream flow after rainfall. Here, we test whether these disruptions to terrestrial-aquatic linkages occur during mild summer drought and whether this affects biota across 43 littoral zone sites in 11 lakes. We use copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) as representative contaminants, and measure abundances of Hyalella azteca, a widespread indicator of ecosystem condition and food web production. We found that tOM concentrations were reduced but correlations with organic soils (wetlands and riparian forests) persisted during mild drought and were sufficient to suppress labile Cu concentrations. Wetlands, however, also became a source of labile Ni to littoral zones, which was linked to reduced abundances of the amphipod H. azteca, on average by up to 70 times across the range of observed Ni concentrations. This reveals a duality in the functional linkage of organic soils to aquatic ecosystems whereby they can help buffer the effects of hydrologic disconnection between catchments and lakes but at the cost of biogeochemical changes that release stored contaminants. As evidence of the toxicity of trace contaminant concentrations and their global dispersion grows, sustaining links among forests, organic soils and aquatic ecosystems in a changing climate will become increasingly important.					; Kielstra, Brian/AAQ-7851-2021; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X; Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; Emilson, Erik/0000-0002-1516-9728; Kielstra, Brian/0000-0003-1105-4971													1354-1013	1365-2486				JAN	2017	23	1					117	126		10.1111/gcb.13361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13361								27197025					WOS:000390218300011

In this study, we proposed a regime-switch modelling (RSM) framework, which integrates change point analysis with dynamic linear regression, to detect and date change points in linear regression, and to quantify the relative importance of natural variations and anthropogenic disturbances. The approach was applied to the long-term hydrological time series to investigate the evolution of river-floodplain relation in Dongting Lake in the last five decades, during which the Yangtze River system experienced unprecedented anthropogenic manipulations. Our results suggested that 1) there were five distinct regimes during which the influence of inflows and local climate on lake water level changed significantly. The detected change points were well corresponding to the major events occurred upon the Yangtze; 2) although the importance of inflows from the Yangtze was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes, the relative contribution gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5. The weakening of hydrological forcing from the Yangtze was mainly attributed to the reduction in channel capacity resulting from sedimentation in the outfalls and water level dropping caused by river bed scour in the mainstream; 3) the effects of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows; and 4) since the operation of The Three Gorges Dam in 2006, the river-floodplain relationship entered a new equilibrium in that all investigated variables changed synchronously in terms of direction and magnitude. The results from this study reveal the mechanisms underlying the alternated inundation regime in Dongting Lake. The identified change points, some of which have not been previously reported, will allow a reappraisal of the current dam and reservoir operation strategies not only for flood/drought risk management but also for the maintenance and restoration of the regional ecological integrity.

An understanding of past variations in effective moisture in such regions is an important prerequisite for the prediction of future hydrological change. Here we evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of effective moisture variations documented by different proxies from 17 records in ACA, and synthesize a decadal-resolution moisture curve for ACA over the past millennium, using 5 of the 17 records selected on the basis of reliable chronologies and robust proxies The high- and low-resolution data all show that, over the past millennium, ACA has been characterized by a relatively dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP: the period from similar to 1000 to 1350 AD), a wet Little Ice Age (LIA. from similar to 1500 to 1850 AD) and increasing moisture during recent decades As a whole, the LIA in the ACA was not only relatively humid but also had high precipitation. Over the past millennium, the multi-centennial moisture changes in ACA show a generally inverse relationship with the temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere, China, and western central Asia The effective moisture history in ACA also shows an out-of-phase relationship with that in monsoon Asia (especially during the LIA). We propose that the humid LIA in ACA, possibly extending to Mediterranean Sea and Western Europe, may have resulted from increased precipitation due to more frequent mid-latitude cyclone activities as a result of the strengthening and equator-ward shift of the westerly jet stream, and the predominantly negative North Atlantic Oscillation conditions, coupled with a decrease in evapo-transpiration caused by the cooling at that time (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ito, Y; Momii, K				Ito, Yuji; Momii, Kazuro			Impacts of regional warming on long-term hypolimnetic anoxia and dissolved oxygen concentration in a deep lake	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Although few reports have described long-term continuous anoxia in aquatic systems, Lake Ikeda in Japan experienced such conditions in the hypolimnion from 1990 to 2010. The present study aimed to assess temporal fluctuations in the lake's thermal stability from 1978 to 2011 to understand the influence of regional climate change on hypolimnetic anoxia in this lake. Because complete vertical mixing, which supplies dissolved oxygen (DO) to the hypolimnion, potentially occurs on February, we calculated the Schmidt stability index (S) in February and compared it with hypolimnetic DO dynamics. Vertical water temperature profiles were calculated using a one-dimensional model, and calculated temperatures and meteorological data were used to analyse annual fluctuations in water temperatures, thermocline depth, meteorological variables and S. We estimated that mean annual air and volume-weighted water temperatures increased by 0.028 and 0.033 degrees C year(-1), respectively, from 1978 to 2011. Between 1986 and 1990, S and water temperature increased abruptly, probably due to a large upwards trend in air temperature (+0.239 degrees C year(-1)). We hypothesize that a mixing regime that lacked overturn took effect at this time and that this regime lasted until 2011, when S was particularly small. These results demonstrate that abrupt climate warming in the late 1980s likely triggered the termination of complete mixing and caused the 21-year period of successive anoxia in Lake Ikeda. We conclude that the lake response to a rapid shift in regional climate conditions was a key factor in changing the hypolimnetic water environment and that thermal stability in winter is a critical environmental factor controlling the mixing regime and anoxic conditions in deep lakes.

J	Karp, CA; Mueller, G				Karp, CA; Mueller, G			Razorback sucker movements and habitat use in the San Juan River inflow, Lake Powell, Utah, 1995-1997	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Seventeen subadult, hatchery-reared razorback stickers (Xyrauchen texanus; ((x) over bar = 456 mm total length) were implanted with sonic transmitters and tracked for 23 months in the lower 89.6 km of die San Juan River (San Juan arm of Lake Powell, Utah). Fish were released at 2 sites, and 9 made extensive up- and downstream movements ((x) over bar similar or equal to 47.8 km; contact was lost with 4, and 4 others presumably died or lost their transmitters). The San Juan arm is primarily inundated canyon; however, most fish contacts occurred in shallow coves and shoreline with thick stands of flooded salt cedar in die upper inflow area. Eight fish frequented the Piute Farms river/lake mixing zone, and at least 4 moved upstream into the San Juan River. Seven fish were found in 2 aggregations in spring (3 fish in Neskahi Bay in 1996 and 4 fish just downstream of Piute Farms in 1997 and these may have been associated with spawning activity. Continued presence of razorback suckers in the Piute Farms area and lower San Juan River suggests the San Juan inflow to Lake Powell could be used as an alternate stocking site for reintroduction efforts.																			1527-0904					JAN	2002	62	1					106	111																WOS:000174058500012

Environmental controls of UV-B radiation in forested streams of Northern Michigan	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												We examined UV-B radiation flux and its environmental control within and among streams of northern Michigan. UV-B flux was estimated in streams by plastic dosimetry strips, which allow for the simultaneous and repeated in situ measurement of solar radiation. During the summer of 2004, UV-B flux was measured across depth gradients and along longitudinal transects in seven streams, which were chosen to encompass a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and canopy cover. Attenuation coefficients of UV-B (K-d (UV-B)) were estimated using plastic dosimeters placed along a depth gradient. K-d (UV-B) were positively correlated with DOC concentration and similar to values obtained with laboratory and in situ spectrometry. Along 100 m longitudinal transects, UV-B flux varied along all streams regardless of their canopy cover and DOC concentration. Within-stream fluxes of UV-B were correlated to canopy cover in the only two streams that both had relatively low DOC concentration and variable canopy cover. Large differences were found among streams in the average UV-B flux (corrected for incident solar flux) reaching the dosimeters at 5 cm depth. These among-stream differences were largely accounted for by the stream width, canopy cover, and DOC concentration. Our results illustrate an inherent variability in UV-B flux within and among streams of northern Michigan that is strongly tied to the interactions of DOC concentration, stream size and riparian vegetation.

The Amazon is home to a large part of these ventures, promoted as a strategy of energy independence in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the countries of the region. However, these hydroelectric plants lead to changes in land cover, fragmentation, degradation, and loss of tropical forests. This article analyzes the spatial pattern of alterations in the land cover of the municipality of Goianesia do Para, one of the seven municipalities affected by the artificial lake of the Tucurui hydroelectric plant. This case study integrates remote sensing and landscape metrics to identify, quantify, and spatialize the loss of tropical forest within the municipality by using satellite images of the TM-Landsat 5, ETM+-Landsat 7 and OLI-Landsat 8 sensors. The results show that the average deforestation rates were high in the first two periods: 1984-1988 (23,101.2 ha per year) and 1988-1999 (13,428.6 ha per year). However, this rate drastically fell in the last period because, by 2010, more than 60% of the territory was already deforested, which shows the consolidation of the municipality's deforestation process.					; DE LIMA, ALINE/AAF-8346-2021; Adami, Marcos/AAK-8358-2020; Velástegui-Montoya, Andrés/ABG-5943-2020	Velastegui Montoya, Andres Danilo/0000-0002-6926-3314; Adami, Marcos/0000-0003-4247-4477; MEIGUINS DE LIMA, ALINE/0000-0002-0594-0187														2220-9964				FEB	2022	11	2							146	10.3390/ijgi11020146	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11020146													WOS:000765522400001

We investigated the lake in Central Asia- Teletskoe (Altai), Kucherla (Altai), Baikal, Arahlei (Chita) - and adjacent areas. Cores of bottom sediments were investigated by method of scanning X-ray fluorescent analysis with synchrotron radiation with the spatial resolution of 0.1 mm. It corresponds to the time resolution similar to 0.2-0.5 year. At each point analyzed more than 30 trace elements from K to U. Geochemical proxy of terrigenous, organogenous and aerosol components of sediments well correlated with regional meteodata for the last 100-150 years. Time series of lithological-geochemical indicators of climate change based on dating by 14C, 137Cs and 210Pb was calibrated by instrumental hydrometeorological data. We used tree-ring series together with element contents as an additional proxy for calculation of transfer function, considering that tree-ring series are response to summer temperature in this climatic zone. Annual temperature and precipitation change for the Central Asia region (0 - 1000 years ago) have been reconstructed using the transfer functions such as: time series proxy function (temperature, precipitation).

In aquatic sciences, this effort is expanding the scope of questions and analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge of the global drivers of water quality. Cyanotoxin concentration is one variable that has received considerable attention, and although strong local-scale models have been described in the literature, modelling cyanotoxin concentrations across broader spatial scales has been more difficult. Commonly used statistical frameworks have not fully captured the complex response of toxic algal blooms to global change, limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the impairment of freshwaters by toxic algae. Here, we advance our understanding of emergent drivers of cyanotoxins across a structured landscape by applying a hierarchical "hurdle" model. Location: Lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States [n = 1127]. Methods: We studied cyanobacteria and their toxins [microcystins] during the 2007 summer period. We applied a hierarchical zero-altered model to test the importance of multi-scale interactions among environmental features in driving microcystin concentrations above the limit of detection. We then used boosted regression trees [BRTs] to identify environmental thresholds associated with severe impairment by microcystins. Results: Accounting for numerous non-detections, spatial heterogeneity and cross-scale interactions substantially improved continental-scale predictions of bloom toxicity. Our model accounted for 55% of the variance in the probability of detecting microcystins across the United States, and 26% of the variability in microcystin concentrations once detected. BRTs further showed that although both local and regional drivers were associated with microcystin concentrations at low to intermediate provisional guidelines, only local drivers came into play when predicting higher limits. Main conclusions: Identifying the interaction between local and regional processes is key to understanding the heterogeneous responses of microcystins to environmental change. Our framework could increase the effectiveness of continental-scale analyses for many different water variables.

J	Lu, YX; Schaefer, L				Lu, YX; Schaefer, L			A solid oxide fuel cell system fed with hydrogen sulfide and natural gas	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) occurs naturally in crude petroleum, natural gas, volcanic gases, hot springs, and some lakes. Hydrogen sulfide can also result as a by-product from industrial activities, such as food processing, coke ovens, paper mills, tanneries, and petroleum refineries. Sometimes, it is considered to be an industrial pollutant. However, hydrogen can be decomposed from H2S and then used as fuel for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). This paper presents an examination of a simple hydrogen sulfide and natural gas-fed solid oxide fuel cell system. The possibility of utilization of hydrogen sulfide as a feedstock in a solid oxide fuel cell is discussed. A system configuration of an SCFC combined with an external H2S decomposition device is proposed, where a certain amount of natural gas is supplied to the SOFC. The exhaust fuel gas of the SOFC is after-burned with exhaust air from the SOFC, and the heat of the combustion gas is utilized in the decomposition of H2S in a decomposition reactor (DR) to produce hydrogen to feed the SOFC. The products are electricity and industry-usable sulfur. Through a mass and energy balance, a preliminary thermodynamic analysis of this system is performed, and the system efficiency is calculated. Also in this paper, the challenges in creating the proposed configuration are discussed, and the direction of future work is presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on Tianjin's Meijiang Lake and its surrounding 47 residential areas, combining Landsat 8 remote sensing satellite data with geographic information system (GIS) buffer analyses and multiple linear regression analyses to reveal the summer thermal characteristics of residential waterfront areas with diverse spatial layouts. The results indicate that: (1) Meijiang Lake's effective cooling radius extends up to 130 m from the water's edge, achieving a maximum temperature reduction of 14.44%. Beyond 810 m, the cooling effect diminishes significantly. (2) Waterfront distance (WD), building density (BD), building width (L) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) emerge as the primary factors influencing changes in average land surface temperature (Delta LST) in residential areas. The degrees of influence are ordered as follows: BD > WD > NDVI > L. "Dispersed" pattern residential areas exhibit the most favorable thermal environments, which are primarily influenced by WD, while "parallel" pattern residential areas demonstrate the least favorable conditions, primarily due to WD and NDVI. (3) The direct adjacency of residential areas to large-scale aquatic bodies proves to be the most effective approach for temperature reduction, resulting in a 5.03% lower average temperature compared to non-adjacent areas. Consequently, this study derives strategies for improving the thermal environment via the regulation of spatial planning elements in residential areas, including waterfront patterns, vegetation coverage, WD, and BD.

J	de Faria, DM; Cardoso, LD; Marques, DD				de Faria, Denise Matias; Cardoso, Luciana de Souza; Marques, David da Motta			Periphytic diatoms exhibit a longitudinal gradient in a large subtropical shallow lake	INLAND WATERS												Some limnological differences among 3 areas in Mangueira Lake, Brazil, a large shallow oligo-mesotrophic system under continuous wind influence, were related to the wind action and influenced diatom community structure. Our goal was to investigate if wind and precipitation influence the attached communities, producing a heterogeneous diatom distribution along the lake. Sampling was performed in summers 2006 and 2008 at the North, Center, and South points of the lake. Biofilms were scraped from natural substrata for quantitative analyses; 17 species were considered abundant. The South is characterized by high transparency and high pH and is influenced by continuous wind perturbation (NE direction), both in frequency and intensity. The diatom community was characterized by low-profile guild and pioneer life-forms, which are resistant to physical disturbances. The North is shallow with high humic acids because of its proximity and interaction with the wetland, and it was characterized by high-profile and motile guilds. Interannual spatial variation was registered due the influence of continuous precipitation before the 2008 sampling date, which made the lake more homogeneous than it was in 2006. The Center acted as a transition point, which was more similar to the North in 2006 and more similar to the South in 2008. The longitudinal gradient was generated due to abiotic characteristics of the North and the South. The diatom community exhibited a longitudinal gradient N -> S, and the diatom life-forms and ecological guilds were a useful tool for examining spatial heterogeneity.					de S Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013; Faria, Denise/E-3452-2013	da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2015	5	2					117	124		10.5268/IW-5.2.665	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-5.2.665													WOS:000353590500004

Although spatially close, these natural archives and living-tree-sites often comprise different micro-climates. Inhomogeneous growth conditions among these habitats, which may yield offsets in growth-rates, require caution in data processing. Here we assess species-specific growth dynamics in two micro-habitats and their potential effects on long chronologies by combining tree-ring data from different living-tree-sites with an "artificial" subfossil dataset. Well replicated (n > 80) Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) chronologies from northern Fennoscandia, sampled directly at the lakeshore (wet) and several meters beyond the lakeshore (dry) reveal high coherence of the variance between micro-sites (r(spruce) = 0.59, r(pine) = 0.68). Significant differences of the Regional Curves (RC) indicate faster growth of both species at the drier site though. Growth differences are more pronounced between the spruce micro-sites. The combination of recent dry and wet spruce data with artificial relict data results in two long chronologies covering the last 800 years with substantially different trends, although they consist of the same relict material and the micro-site chronologies correlate significantly over the past two centuries. The combination of spruce samples from dry inland micro-sites with subfossil samples originating from the wet lake shore can result in an underestimation of past temperatures prior to the 19th century. Such effects, hidden in the composition of long chronologies (living trees + subfossil samples) can bias long-term trends in climate reconstructions.					; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018	Schneider, Lea/0000-0002-8208-7300; Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X													0037-5330	2242-4075					2015	49	1							1220															WOS:000350625300005
J	Stenberg, JA; Stenberg, JE				Stenberg, Johan A.; Stenberg, Johanna E.			Herbivory limits the yellow water lily in an overgrown lake and in flowing water	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Aquatic macrophytes with floating leaves are often key ecological species that affect entire aquatic ecosystems. Here we describe an investigation of the importance of insect herbivory for population growth and leaf senescence in the yellow water lily (Nuphar lutea). In order to gain a general picture of the importance of herbivory under different conditions, we experimentally manipulated herbivory in a large lily population in natural still water and observed the natural development of 32 smaller populations in flowing water. Herbivory drastically increased leaf senescence, reducing leaf density. In the still water, over one summer, leaf density increased by a factor of 1.23 in the presence of water lily leaf beetles and 1.61 when herbivory was eliminated. In flowing water, population growth was restricted mainly by leaf crowdedness, which limited large dense populations. Herbivory by water lily leaf beetles also had a limiting effect on yellow water lily, again mainly in large dense populations. Small populations supported a lower density of beetles. Previous studies have not addressed population-level responses of vascular plants with floating leaves. Our results suggest that herbivory can result in greater light penetration into the water and reduce "enemy-free space" for aquatic species that find such space in water lily stands. We suggest that the water lily leaf beetle should be considered an "ecological engineer.".

J	Yansa, CH; Ashworth, AC				Yansa, CH; Ashworth, AC			Late Pleistocene Palaeoenvironments of the Southern Lake Agassiz Basin, USA	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Macroscopic plant remains, pollen, insect and mollusc fossils recovered from a cut bank on the Red River in North Dakota, USA, provide evidence that an extensive wetland occupied the southern basin of Lake Agassiz from 10 230 to 9900 C-14 yr BP. Marsh-dwelling plants and invertebrates had colonised the surface of a prograding delta during the low-water Moorhead Phase of Lake Agassiz. A species of Salix (willow) was abundant along distributary channels, and stands of Populus tremuloides (aspen), Ulmus sp. (elm), Betula sp. (birch), and Picea sp. (spruce) grew on the better-drained sand bars and beach ridges. Most of the species of plants, insects, and molluscs represented as fossils are within their existing geographic ranges. Based on a few species with more northerly distributions, mean summer temperature may have been about 1-2 degrees C lower than the present day. No change in species composition occurred in the transition from the Younger Dryas to Preboreal. At the time that the wetland existed, Lake Agassiz was draining either eastward to the North Atlantic Ocean or northwestward to the Arctic Ocean. The wetland was drowned during the Emerson Phase transgression that resulted in meltwater draining southward to the Gulf of Mexico after 9900 C-14 yr BP.

J	BURDYL, P; POST, FJ				BURDYL, P; POST, FJ			SURVIVAL OF ESCHERICHIA-COLI IN GREAT SALT LAKE WATER	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Survival of E. coli was studied in water from the Great Salt Lake, a highly saline lake with an ionic composition much like seawater. Samples used were from the most concentrated north arm (343.1 g l-1 solids) and the less concentrated south arm (about 113 g l-1 solids). At temperatures from 20-9.degree. C the bacterial death rate (k) for the north arm was -0.17 log day-1 and the south arm and 1:3 dilution -0.28 log day-1. Above 9.degree. C the rate of death increased approximately exponentially, and at 19.degree. C the rate of death increased approximately exponentially, and at 19.degree. C the death rate was -1.31 log day-1 in the north arm and -0.98 log day-1 in the lower salinity water. These rates fell within those reported for seawater and were much higher than fresh water. Possible causes of death are discussed with the most likely being the high concentrations of minor elements or osmotic stress. The survival characteristics of E. coli in waters with a seawater-like composition should require the same health concern as seawater regardless of the actual concentration of salt. High salt water of other ionic composition may behave differently.

J	Zhang, LY; Hou, SX; Xie, ZW				Zhang, Leying; Hou, Shuxiu; Xie, Zuowei			On the Successiveness of the Two Extreme Cold Events in China during the 2020/21 Winter According to Cold Air Trajectories	ATMOSPHERE												Two extreme cold air events successively hit China during 28-31 December 2020 (the late 2020 event) and during 6-8 January 2021 (the early 2021 event), which caused great losses. These two events have received extensive attention in relation to synoptic weather systems and remote forcing. Although it has been noted that a near-surface cool condition can greatly impact tropospheric circulation, its role in the successiveness of two such extreme cold waves remains unclear. This study focused on cold air pathways from the Lagrangian perspective, and explored the potential influence of cold air over the key region in terms of connecting the two cold events using a piecewise potential vorticity inversion. With the obtained results, three cold air sources with three corresponding air routes were identified in the two cold events. The northern pathway dominated the late 2020 event, in which the cold air intruded from the eastern Laptev Sea and moved southward to China. In contrast, the early 2021 event was mainly associated with the northwestern pathway in which the cold air came from the Ural Mountains and moved clockwise. Notably, cold air traveling along the western route from western Lake Balkhash arrived at the north of the Tianshan Mountains earlier and amplified the positive height anomaly in situ. Moreover, such an enhanced positive height anomaly moved the direction of the cold air from the northern and northwestern routes southward and thus played a key role in the successiveness of the two extreme cold events.

Their identification is carried out by specialists, the main difficulty being the wide variety of existing species and the great similarity between some of them. In recent years attempts have been made to create an automatic identification system with the collaboration of experts in areas of pattern recognition. In this research we analyzed the use of binary masks of rings in images as a method to automatically identify diatoms, or render an approximative identification. Among the advantages of the proposed method is its invariance regarding the different positions in which the diatoms can be found. Invariance to illumination changes is achieved by means of different transforms, such as the power law transform. The image databases used to develop the algorithms were diatom images taken from samples collected at springs in Lake Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico, at the San Lazaro basin, Baja California Sur, Mexico and from the public image database of ADIAC.

Survival of female mallards along the Vermont-Quebec border region	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Understanding effects of location and timing of harvest seasons on mortality of ducks and geese from hunting is important in forming regulations that sustain viable waterfowl populations throughout their range. During 1990 and 1991 we alternately marked 80 hatching year (HY), female mallards along the Vermont-Quebec border; half with radio-transmitters and bands and half with only aluminum leg bands. We monitored radio-marked ducks daily and recorded survival status weekly for 15 weeks from August until December each year. Mallard mortalities began 25 September when the hunting season opened in the Province of Quebec, Canada. Overall survival of mallards at week 10 did not differ between years (0.51 in 1990 vs. 0.43 in 1991) or differ from that of HY American black ducks (0.44 females, 0.42 males) based on proportional hazard analysis in a Bayesian framework. The mortality rates for mallards from hunting (0.47) and causes unrelated to hunting (0.06) were similar between years and to those rates for HY black ducks at that same site. Hunter harvest accounted for most of the mortality recorded during this study and illegal feeding (i.e., baiting) at sites just before and during the hunting season was observed. Females with lower body condition index had greater mortality rates; a 1-standard-deviation increase in condition index would reduce mortality hazard by about 29%. Management options that may increase mallard survival in the area include lowering daily bag limit in Quebec and suspending split hunting seasons in Vermont that increase harvest, delaying opening date of hunting in Quebec to allow for increased body condition before hunting season opens, and improving enforcement of baiting restrictions.

Investigating the role of riparian vegetation in the related processes will provide insights into the mechanisms by which riparian zones retain soil N. Methods In our study, the proportion of plant N uptake, fine root (diameter < 1mm) biomass and fine root morphology at five soil depths (0-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, and 60-75 cm) for Acorus calamus, Canna indica and Phragmites communis were measured in Taihu Lake Basin. Results The soil layer from which the majority of N was absorbed was 0-15 cm (50.8 +/- 1.0, 56.0 +/- 1.4 and 37.5 +/- 3.2% for A. calamus, C. indica, and P. communis, respectively). The N uptake from 45 to 75 cm for P. communis (21.2 +/- 2.2%) was significantly higher than A. calamus (14.9 +/- 0.7%) and C. indica (9.2 +/- 1.5%) (P < 0.05). Our results showed that N uptake was directly proportional to root morphological characteristics such as specific root surface area (SRA, P < 0.05) and specific root length (SRL, P < 0.01), but the relationships varied among species. Changes in environmental factors caused by soil depth strongly influenced some of the root morphological indicators (e.g., fine root biomass, mean diameter (D)). Conclusions Soil environmental factors and plant root morphology jointly influenced plant N uptake. During vegetation selections of the riparian restoration projects, plants with high SRL or SRA should be given priority due to their expected high capacity in N uptake. But cautions need to be taken as the positive relationships between SRL and SRA and plant N uptake may vary between plant species. Optimal selection of diverse species with complementary nutrient uptake strategies could maximize N uptake at various soil depths and overall N removal from agricultural runoff.					wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025	Hu, Jing/0000-0001-5742-0688													0032-079X	1573-5036				MAR	2022	472	1-2					527	542		10.1007/s11104-021-05270-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05270-8		JAN 2022											WOS:000744801700001

In recent years, the Orontes River has been struggling with water hyacinth, an invasive species that completely covers the river's surface. Within the scope of this study, the history of water hyacinth in the Orontes River was examined using remote sensing and crowdsourced data. Optical data with different spatial resolutions (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite data were used as remote sensing data. Google News, used as crowdsourced data, was compared with time series obtained from satellite data, emphasizing the complementary role of all three data types (optical, SAR and crowdsourced). Using PlanetScope Dove satellite data, the growth, development and extinction cycle of water hyacinth within a year were investigated according to water hyacinth density. In line with the results obtained, it is revealed that the water hyacinth began to appear after June, grew in the summer months, reached its peak in October-November, and disappeared after November with the increasing precipitation. This study is the first to examine water hyacinths in the Orontes River using remote sensing and crowdsourced data, and the results will guide decision-makers in the fight against water hyacinths.					; Yagmur Aydin, Nur/AAA-7286-2020	Yagmur, Nur/0000-0002-5915-6929; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				JAN 17	2025	46	2					835	858		10.1080/01431161.2024.2423912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2024.2423912		NOV 2024											WOS:001350625600001

SARS-CoV-2 has so far not been detected in objects supplying drinking water, or in swimming pool water subjected to disinfection. Our study verified the possibility of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus in open waters of natural bathing areas where no disinfection is conducted. The research covered three bathing areas organised in lakes of the & Lstrok;& eogon;czy & nacute;sko-W & lstrok;odawskie Lakeland (E Poland). The results of analysis of water samples collected twice from the bathing areas in the summer season 2021 showed that irrespectively of the hydro-chemical water properties or study term, the RNA of microorganisms content was at a level of 200 ng/mu l, and SARS-COV-2 ORF1ab and SARS-COV-2GEN N < 200 copies of the virus/100 ml. The concentration of Escherichia coli did not exceed the acceptable norms for bathing areas (<1000 CFU/100 ml). The bathing areas showed higher than average concentrations of ammonium ion, orthophosphates, chlorophyll "a", turbidity, and urea in comparison to analysed sites outside the bathing areas. Statistically significant correlations with the number of bathing persons were determined for urea (P <= 0.01) and RNA of microorganisms (P <= 0.05). This suggests the possibility of the use of urea as an indirect indicator for fast (in situ) identification of human contaminants of bathing areas. The study was conducted in a period of low COVID-19 morbidity, and does not exclude the possibility of potential infection in natural waters of bathing areas.

Nonetheless, external N influxes may stimulate the proliferation of non-N2-fixing cyanobacteria, thereby fostering cyanobacteria blooms during summer seasons. To elucidate the significance of N regulation, a two-factor orthogonal experiment was performed to study the influences of external N input on the efficacy of lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB), a sediment capping material for P immobilization. At the experimentation ends, the total suspended solids (TSS), organic suspended solids (OSS) concentrations and optical attenuation coefficient (Kd) in the LMB + N treatment were 7.34, 8.65 and 5.20 times higher, respectively, compared to the LMB treatment. The total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in the LMB + N treatment were 3.02, 1.30 and 0.60 times higher, respectively, than those in the LMB treatment. However, TP and SRP in the LMB + N treatment were 46.98% and 54.93% lower, respectively, compared to N treatment. The chlorophyll a (Chl a ) concentration of algae in the LMB + N treatment was observed to be 2.86 times higher compared to the LMB treatment, and 17.13% lower compared to the N treatment. The biomass of cyanobacteria accounted for more than 95% of algae in the LMB + N treatment and N treatment. Furthermore, the photosynthetic performance of algae in the N treatment increased significantly, compared to the LMB + N treatment. Our results indicated that external N influxes significantly reduce the efficacy of LMB to control P and algae. Thus, the implementation of more stringent N control policies holds great significance in the eutrophication control.

The distribution of temperature, oxygen and nutrients in Lake Bukoni, Uganda	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Temperature, oxygen and nutrients were determined in the permanently stratified Lake Bukoni from July 2004 to December 2005. Meromixis has resulted from the nature of the surrounding hilly topography and the almost vertical crater walls that exclude the effects of light winds. These circumstances and the tropical temperature regime ensure permanent stratification in the offshore part of the lake. From about 20 m to the bottom, the water was out of circulation and devoid of oxygen. Water samples from such depths had a strong smell of hydrogen sulphide gas. The inshore site, with greater turbulence and littoral area, had a uniformly oxygenated water column compared with the offshore site. According to information from members of the community around the lake, 'fish kills' have taken place but on irregular occasions. The nutrients (N, P and Si) were well distributed in the inshore site. In the offshore site, the concentrations were generally lower in the uppermost 20 m but more than double near the mud surface. Soluble reactive phosphorous was the least abundant nutrient while soluble reactive silicon was the most abundant nutrient. The high Si : P ratios have led to the dominance of species like Synedra ulna Ehr.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				DEC	2009	47	4					658	663		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01036.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01036.x													WOS:000271758600025

In this study, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of the southern Jiangsu (SJ) segment of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal (SJ-BHGC) were explored. Fluorescent component similarity and high-performance size exclusion chromatography analyses indicated that the textile printing and dyeing wastewater might be one of the main pollution sources in SJ-BHGC. The water quality parameters and intensities of fluorescent components (WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20)) decreased to low level due to the collective shutdown of all industries in SJ region during the Spring Festival holiday and the outbreak of the domestic COVID-19 pandemic in China Uanuary 24th to late February, 2020). Then, they presented a gradual upward trend after the domestic epidemic was under control. In mid-March, the outbreak of the international COVID-19 pandemic hit the garment export trade of China and consequently inhibited the production activities of textile printing and dyeing industry (TPDI) in SJ region. After peaking on March 26th, the intensities of WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) decreased again with changed intensity ratio until April 12th. During the study period (135 days), correlation analysis revealed that WT-C1 and WT-C2 possessed homology and their fluorescence intensities were highly positively correlated with conductivity and CODMn. With fluorescence fingerprint (FF) technique, this study not only excavated the characteristics and pollution causes of water body in SJ-BHGC, but also provided novel insights into impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on production activities of TPDI and aquatic environment of SJ-BHGC. The results of this study indicated that FF technique was an effective tool for precise supervision of water environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

According to homogeneous compositions and sparse biostratigraphic resolution, a consistent stratigraphic concept from the basin margins into the foreland depocenter was still lacking. New investigations on several deep drill cores throughout the basin provide comprehensive sedimentological, mineralogical, chemical and micropaleontological data. A calcite poor. fossil- and pyrite-free, smectite-rich, up to 800 m thick interval was identified and correlated to the time interval of the late Ottnangian brackish Rzehakia Lake System. For this section, we introduce the term Calcite Minimum Interval (CMI). We define the onset of the CMI by a sharp decrease of calcite contents and the disappearance of autochthonous (and reworked) calcareous nannofossils. We define the termination of the CMI by the permanent increase of pyrite contents and the reappearance of calcareous nannofossils. The CMI as a litho- and chemostratigraphical marker for the Rzehakia Lake System constitutes a stratigraphic key horizon. Within the NAFB in Lower Austria, its onset corresponds to the middle/upper Ottnangian transition while its termination correlates roughly to the Ottnangian/Karpatian boundary. This allows a precise definition, identification and correlation of (upper) Ottnangian stratigraphic units of the NAFB. For the central basinal parts of the Rzehakia Lake System, we introduce the new lithostratigraphic term Wildendurnbach Formation which correlates to the marginal Traisen Formation.					; Wagreich, Michael/D-2279-2013; Soliman, Ali/R-1583-2018	Soliman, Ali/0000-0001-7366-4607; Kallanxhi, Madalina-Elena/0000-0002-0959-391X; Wagreich, Michael/0000-0002-8828-0857													1335-0552	1336-8052				AUG	2018	69	4					315	+		10.1515/geoca-2018-0019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geoca-2018-0019													WOS:000441058100001

The withdrawal elevation controls largely the transfer of heat and constituents in the dam in particular during thermal stratification. Fifteen scenarios of withdrawal elevation are possible. To identify the most effective scenarios, a hierarchical clustering technique was performed and only four scenarios were clustered. Deep withdrawals deepen the hypoxia, increase the thickness of the metalimnion, and weaken the stratification stability, which facilitate the vertical transfer of heat and dissolved oxygen mainly. Surface withdrawals, however, shrink the metalimnion and tend to strengthen the stratification, resulting in less transfer of matter from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion. Most of the bottom sediment is overlaid by the hypolimnion. The oxygen depletes significantly and waters become anoxic at a few meters depth. For all scenarios, the reservoir experiences a summer hypolimnetic anoxia, which lasts from 42 to 80 days and seems to decrease as withdrawal elevation increases. At the end of stratification, waters below the withdrawal elevation showed a noticeable release of iron, nutrients, and suspended sediments that increases with depth and near-bottom turbulence. Attention should be drawn to shallower withdrawals because they accumulate nutrients and silts continuously in the reservoir, which may deteriorate water quality. Based on these results, a withdrawal elevation rule is presented. This rule may be adjusted to optimize water withdrawal elevation for dams in the region with similar geometry.					; Adelana, Segun/D-8192-2019	Adelana, Segun Michael/0000-0002-3696-7227; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2015	187	5							292	10.1007/s10661-015-4509-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4509-3								25910720					WOS:000355607100036

This study presents multiproxy results of the grain size, elemental ratios (Zr/Rb, and Rb/Sr), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N ratios, together with high -precision 137Cs/210Pb and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C ages of a sediment core from Lake Bax-ian, which is a small closed lake in Guangxi Province, southern China. Based on these high-resolution data, the hydroclimate change over the last two millennia is clearly revealed. Relatively high values of the mean grain size, Zr/Rb, TOC and TN, along with low values of Rb/Sr and C/N ratios during the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP, 500-900 CE) and Little Ice Age (LIA, 1400-1850 CE), indicate a relatively wet climate during these intervals. Conversely, low values of the mean grain size, Zr/Rb, TOC and TN, along with high Rb/Sr ratios during the Roman Warm Period (RWP, 50-400 CE) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 1000-1300 CE), suggest rela-tively dry conditions during these intervals. During the Current Warm Period (CWP, 1850-present), the values of the mean grain size and Zr/Rb increase abruptly and Rb/Sr ratios exhibit large fluctuations, which might be attributed to the impact of human activities. The general pattern of the reconstructed hydroclimate variations in this study is broadly consistent with the North Atlantic ice-rafted detritus and Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) records, indicating that the hydroclimate variability on the centennial-scale in southern China has been controlled by both high-and low-latitude forcings over the last two millennia.

J	Piret, L; Bertrand, S				Piret, Loic; Bertrand, Sebastien			Multidecadal delay between deglaciation and formation of a proglacial lake sediment record	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Basal ages obtained from proglacial lake sediments are often used to constrain deglaciation histories, based on the assumption that fine-grained stratigraphic records start forming immediately after glacier retreat. Here, we test this assumption by studying the onset of sedimentation in Calluqueo Lake, Chilean Patagonia, which progressively deglaciated between the 1940s and the end of the 20th century. Although the glacier-proximal basin has been ice-free for at least three decades, it does not yet contain a fine-grained stratigraphic record, despite the modern sedimentation rate of similar to 3 cm yr(-1). By comparison, the distal basin contains a fine-grained stratigraphic record starting in 1997 +/- 2 CE, i.e., 20-50 years after it was deglaciated. Based on these results, we show that several decades are required for similar to 1 m of finegrained sediments to accumulate between the coarse till material and sufficiently smoothen the uneven lake floor to start forming a fine-grained stratigraphic record. Although the exact timing depends on lake floor morphology and sediment accumulation rates, our results suggest that proglacial lake sediment records lack the first decades of sedimentation. This delay is mostly negligible when using radiocarbon ages from basal sediments to date glacier retreat since it falls within the range of radiocarbon uncertainties, though its importance increases throughout the Holocene. It is however significant for chronologies entirely based on varve-counting. Therefore, our results support the use of basal ages to establish deglaciation chronologies but they call for attention when using them to reconstruct Holocene ice retreat, especially with varve chronologies.

J	Mensing, S; Livingston, S; Barker, P				Mensing, S; Livingston, S; Barker, P			Long-term fire history in Great Basin sagebrush reconstructed from macroscopic charcoal in spring sediments, Newark Valley, Nevada	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												We use macroscopic charcoal analysis to reconstruct fire history in sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata var. wyomingensis and A. tridentata var. tridentata), in Newark Valley, Nevada. We analyzed charcoal at continuous 1-cm intervals (similar to 7-127 years), and pollen at 2- to 10-cm intervals (similar to 70-263 years) in a core spanning the last 5500 cal yr BP (calendar years before present). A charcoal peak in the historic period was associated with a > 1400-ha fire dated to 1986 that burned in the watershed. We reconstructed the prehistoric fire history by inferring fires from similar charcoal peaks that were significantly greater than the background charcoal accumulation. Our results suggest the fire regime is climate and fuel driven. During periods of wetter climate, sagebrush increased and fires were more abundant, and during extended dry periods when sagebrush decreased, fires were less frequent. Our method does not allow calculation of a fire-return interval; however, our results support models that estimate a mean fire-return interval of up to a century in Artemisia tridentata var. wyomingensis. The charcoal record indicates that fires have increased within the historic period. This contrasts with pinyon/juniper studies that indicate an expansion of woodland associated with fewer fires in the historic period. We suggest that in the central Great Basin, a regime of frequent fires in sagebrush that limits woodland expansion is true for the sagebrush-woodland ecotone, but in sagebrush-dominated valleys with lower fuel loads, fires have always been less frequent. Protecting sagebrush-dominated valleys from frequent fire would appear to be consistent with the prehistoric fire regime.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				JAN	2006	66	1					64	77		10.3398/1527-0904(2006)66[64:LFHIGB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/1527-0904(2006)66[64:LFHIGB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000235530900006

Samples were taken of water and bottom sediments. In terms of their physico-chemical composition, the tested waters can be characterized as slightly polluted. In terms of zinc and copper concentrations, the waters belong to purity class I, but the contents of cadmium, lead, and nickel exceed the Proposed Environmental Quality Standards for Priority Substances. As far as copper, nickel, zinc, and cadmium are concerned, the studied sediments were not polluted, and the geo-chemical index values were within class I. The relevant accumulation rates for metals in sediments can be ordered as follows: Cd<Ni<Pb<Cu<Zn. The studied parameters changed (in both rivers) according to how far down the stream samples were taken. The sites nearest the Petroleum and Natural Gas Mine at Karlino had the highest concentrations of all the metals in question. Further down the stream the values fell and the river water self-purification process was evident. It is encouraging to see that despite a clear impact of the operation of the mine on the examined water quality, the aquatic environment seems not only able to absorb pollutants, but also to recover over a relatively short section of the river.

Our study was designed to measure background-corrected wintertime ambient CO and CO2 concentrations in Prove before, during, and after oxyfuel periods. Any oxyfuel effect would be manifested as a lower CO/CO2 ratio from spark-ignition vehicles during the oxyfuel period. Salt Lake City, which did not introduce oxyfuels, was used as a control for weather, house heating, and other differences, unrelated to oxyfuel use, between oxyfuel and non-oxyfuel periods. An apparent effect on ambient-air CO/CO2 ratios at traffic sites was invariably observed but proved to be of marginal to low statistical significance; our best estimate of the CO oxyfuels benefit at the traffic sites is 15 +/- 20%. In the parking garages, a reduction variously estimated as 11% or 33% was observed, indicating significant CO benefits from oxyfuels during cold-start; however, the random uncertainty in this estimate is not known. A second objective of this study was to see whether this new method is feasible. Our conclusion is that improvements are needed but it was successful enough to warrant evaluation against other methods.																			0143-3369						1997	18	3-4					379	390																WOS:A1997XA71500011

In some lakes, acid-sensitive fish populations have declined. A nationwide survey of fishers showed that, at present, the number of fishers whose primary fishing waters are affected by airborne acidification is negligible compared to the estimated total number of adult fishers (1.1 million). The proportion of the fishers who mainly fish in water types sensitive to airborne acidification is considerable, 3% for the rivers in northern Finland and 21% for small forest lakes. There is general concern among fishers about the effects of acidification. Changes in the fishing waters are attributed to acidification by 5-10% of the fishers, although in most cases other information about the fishing waters rules out acidification as an explanation for the changes, Among those who fish in sensitive types of waters, a willingness to mitigate potential damages was reported by approximately one third of all fishers. Clear differences in the willingness to rehabilitate the fishery were observed in relation to the importance of fishing as a spare time activity and the distance between the fishing waters and a home or summer cottage.																			0364-152X					NOV-DEC	1994	18	6					831	840		10.1007/BF02393613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02393613													WOS:A1994PK99300003

During the experimental period, a total of 17 soundings were launched on ten field days. These soundings covered both single- and multiple-band events under a variety of conditions, including heavy snowfall rates of up to 13 cm h-1. As expected, the soundings showed moist-adiabatic conditions within the cloud layer with a stable layer at cloud-top level. In an intense single-band case, soundings showed a parcel buoyancy of 2.5-degrees-C within the band at 2 km above ground level (AGL). Furthermore, the base of the inversion within the band was displaced some 0.6 km above that of the surrounding environment. Sensible heating of the low-level air as it flowed over the warm lake is postulated to be the primary source of this temperature surplus. Strong surface convergence and parcel buoyancy within the band apparently combined to produce the overshooting cloud top and the observed heavy snowfall rate. Multiple-band soundings showed little difference between the thermodynamic environments within and adjacent to the bands. Analysis of the soundings indicates that the depth of the mixed layer may be of greater importance than the strength of instability in determining the intensity of lake-effect precipitation.																			0027-0644					SEP	1991	119	9					2323	2332		10.1175/1520-0493(1991)119<2323:MSOOLE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1991)119<2323:MSOOLE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1991GF87600014

This study shows a water-management oriented use of next generation sequencing (NGS) to specifically pinpoint toxigenic cyanobacteria within a bloom simultaneously containing three of the most widespread cyanotoxins (the hepatotoxins microcystins, MCs; and the neurotoxins anatoxin-a, ATX, and saxitoxins, STXs). The 2013 summer bloom in Rosarito reservoir (Spain) comprised 33 cyanobacterial OTUs based on 16S rRNA metabarcoding, 7 of which accounted for as much as 96.6% of the community. Cyanotoxins and their respective biosynthesis genes were concurrently present throughout the entire bloom event including: MCs and mcyE gene; ATX and anaF gene; and STXs and sxtI gene. NGS applied to amplicons of cyanotoxin-biosynthesis genes unveiled 6 toxigenic OTUs, comprising 3 involved in MCs production (Planktothrix agardhii and 2 Microcystis spp.), 2 in ATX production (Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi and Phormidium/Tychonema spp.) and 1 in STXs production (Aphanizomenon gracile). These toxigenic taxa were also present in 16S rRNA OTUs list and their relative abundance was positively correlated with the respective toxin concentrations. Our results point at MC-producing P. agardhii and ATX-producing C. issatschenkoi as the main contributors to the moderate toxin concentrations observed, and suggest that their distribution in Southern Europe is broader than previously thought. Our findings also stress the need for monitoring low-abundance cyanobacteria (<1% relative abundance) in cyanotoxicity studies, and provide novel data on the presence of picocyanobacteria and potentially ATX-producing benthic taxa (e.g., Phormidium) in deep thermally-stratified water bodies. This study showcases a straightforward use of amplicon metagenomics of cyanotoxin biosynthesis genes in a multi-toxin bloom thus illustrating the broad applicability of NGS for water management in risk-oriented monitoring of CyanoHABs.

The sum concentrations of polychlorinated phenols (PCP) and biphenyls (PCB) were both about 1 mu g/g lipid weight (lw) in Lake Vanaja mussels, while in the River Kymijoki mussels PCPs were non-detectable and PCBs were measured 120 ng/g lw. The concentrations of toxic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners ranged between <17 and 370 pg/g lw in Lake Vanaja mussels and between <38 and 11,000 pg/g lw in the River Kymijoki mussels. Polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDE) were detected in the mussels incubated in the River Kymijoki (0.4-1.1 ng/g lw), but not in those incubated in Lake Vanaja. Polychlorinated phenoxyanisoles (PCPA) were measured 33 ng/g lw and polychlorinated phenoxyphenols (PCPP) 300 ng/g lw in the mussels incubated in the River Kymijoki.

Changes in Fish Assemblages at the Mirror Lake Complex in the Lower Columbia River Before and After a Culvert Modification	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Changes in fish assemblages were examined before and after a culvert was modified to improve the fish passage at the Mirror Lake Complex (MLC), located along the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon. Conditions at the culvert limited water flow between the Columbia River and the MLC during certain portions of the year; thus, the outlet and interior of the culvert were modified to improve fish passage. Prior to the culvert modification, three sites were sampled monthly between April and August 2008, 5.0 km and 0.5 km upstream of the culvert and immediately downstream of the culvert. Following the culvert modification in the late summer of 2008, the same sites were sampled from 2009 to 2012, with two additional sites added in 2010. Prior to the culvert modification, the lower sites (i.e., the sites closest to the Columbia River) supported native and nonnative fish species, while the upper sites were dominated by native species. During the 4 years of monitoring after culvert modification, these distinctions between the upper and lower sites remained. A significant increase in water temperature and species richness was observed at the site just upstream of the culvert, but other changes in fish composition (density, diversity, percent of nonnative species) were not observed. However, at the upper sites, while nonnative species were absent before culvert modification, they were present after modification. Modifications made at the culvert, in combination with seasonal variation in water level and water temperature, may have influenced fish communities in the MLC. Given predicted regional and global climatic changes, our study indicates the importance of long-term monitoring of restoration sites for the presence of nonnative species and the effects of environmental variables, such as water temperature.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2019	39	6					1348	1359		10.1002/nafm.10374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10374		NOV 2019											WOS:000496617000001

Performance of Diploid and Triploid Rainbow Trout Stocked in Idaho Alpine Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Increased growth, improved survival, and genetic protection of wild stocks have been suggested as benefits of stocking triploid (i.e., sterile) salmonids for recreational fisheries. We examined the return rates and growth of mixed-sex diploid (2N), mixed-sex triploid (3N), and all-female triploid (AF3N) rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss across 28 alpine lakes. Equal numbers of each treatment group were stocked in 2001 and 2003 and sampled 3-4 years later. During 2004 and 2005, a total of 75 2N and 36 3N marked rainbow trout were recaptured. Taken together, the 2N fish accounted for an average of 0.68 of the total marked fish caught, and the combined proportions of test fish (including netting and angling) differed significantly between the test groups and were consistent across survey years. During 2006 and 2007, a total of 60 2N, 31 3N, and 208 AF3N marked rainbow trout were recaptured. The mean length of the test fish was similar between test groups within sampling years. Overall, the return of 3N rainbow trout to alpine lakes in Idaho was low compared with that of 2N trout, whereas AF3N trout appeared to return in higher proportions than both of the other groups. The triploid stocks studied in this evaluation did not show any growth advantages over the duration of the study. Study design limitations may have contributed in part to some of the differences in the number of 2N and 3N rainbow trout captured. However, our results suggest that fisheries managers should consider all-female triploid rainbow trout as a low-risk option for maintaining alpine lake fisheries while minimizing the impact on native stocks.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2011	31	1					124	133		10.1080/02755947.2011.561163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.561163													WOS:000288279800014

The biomasses of the respective fish species amount to ca. 250, 25 and 10 kg ha-1 and correspond to those in Tjeukemeer, another lake in The Netherlands. The average size of bream, however, is much smaller in the Loosdrecht lakes as a consequence of poorer feeding conditions. The zooplankton community in the Loosdrecht lakes is predominantly composed of relatively small species such as Daphnia cucullata, Bosmina coregoni and cyclopoid copepods, whereas in Tjeukemeer, Daphnia hyalina is permanently present in relatively high densities and the other species show a larger mean length. In the Loosdrecht lakes, the absence of D. hyalina and the smaller sizes of the other zooplankton species could be the consequence of a higher predation pressure, in combination with unfavourable feeding conditions for the zooplankton including the low density of green algae and the high density of filamentous cyanobacteria. A biomanipulation experiment in Lake Breukeleveen, one of the Loosdrecht lakes, indicated that feeding conditions were too unfavourable for large zooplankton to develop in spring, when the reduced fish biomass was not yet supplemented by natural recruitment and immigration.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936													0018-8158					MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					87	94		10.1007/BF00016098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016098													WOS:A1992JD64800010

Carbonate isotope geochemistry as a record of riverine runoff	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Evaporation dominates the removal of water from Lake Tanganyika, and therefore the oxygen isotope composition of lake water has become very positive in comparison to the waters entering the lake. The surface water in Lake Tanganyika has remained relatively unchanged over the last 30 years with a seasonal range of +3.2 to +3.5 parts per thousand VSMOW. Water from small rivers entering the lake seems to have a delta O-18 value between -3.5 and -4.0 parts per thousand, based on scattered measurements. The two largest catchments emptying into the lake deliver water that has a delta O-18 value between these two extremes. This large contrast is the basis of a model presented here that attempts to reconstruct the history of runoff intensity based on the delta O-18 of carbonate shells from Lake Tanganyika cores. In order to use biogenic carbonates to monitor changes in the delta O-18 of mixing-zone water, however, the oxygen isotope fractionation between water and shell carbonate must be well understood. The relatively invariant environmental conditions of the lake allow us to constrain the fractionation of both oxygen and carbon isotope ratios. Although molluskan aragonitic shell delta O-18 values are in agreement with published mineral-water fractionations, ostracode calcite is similar to 1.2 parts per thousand more positive than that of inorganic calcite precipitated under similar conditions. Ostracode shell delta O-18 data from two cores from central Lake Tanganyika suggest that runoff decreased in the first half of this millennium and has increased in the last century. This conclusion is poorly constrained, however, and much more work needs to be done on stable isotope variation in both the waters and carbonates of Lake Tanganyika. We also compared the delta C-13 of shells against predicted values based solely on the delta C-13 of lake water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The ostracode Mecynocypria opaca is the only ostracode or mollusk that falls within the predicted range. This suggests that M. opaca has potential for reconstructing the carbon isotope ratio of DIC in Lake Tanganyika, and may be a useful tool in the study of the history of the lake's productivity and carbon cycle.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2005	34	1					93	105		10.1007/s10933-005-2400-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-2400-x													WOS:000229504500007

The influence of a severe reservoir drawdown on springtime zooplankton and larval fish assemblages in Red Willow Reservoir, Nebraska	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Reservoirs can be dynamic systems, often prone to unpredictable and extreme water-level fluctuations, and can be environments where survival is difficult for zooplankton and larval fish. Although numerous studies have examined the effects of extreme reservoir drawdown on water quality, few have examined extreme drawdown on both abiotic and biotic characteristics. A fissure in the dam at Red Willow Reservoir in southwest Nebraska necessitated an extreme drawdown; the water level was lowered more than 6 m during a two-month period, reducing reservoir volume by 76%. During the subsequent low-water period (i.e., post-drawdown), spring sampling (April-June) showed dissolved oxygen concentration was lower, while turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration were greater, relative to pre-drawdown conditions. Additionally, there was an overall increase in zooplankton density, although there were differences among taxa, and changes in mean size among taxa, relative to pre-drawdown conditions. Zooplankton assemblage composition had an average dissimilarity of 19.3% from pre-drawdown to post-drawdown. The ratio of zero to non-zero catches was greater post-drawdown for larval common carp and for all larval fishes combined, whereas we observed no difference for larval gizzard shad. Larval fish assemblage composition had an average dissimilarity of 39.7% from pre-drawdown to post-drawdown. Given the likelihood that other dams will need repair or replacement in the near future, it is imperative for effective reservoir management that we anticipate the likely abiotic and biotic responses of reservoir ecosystems as these management actions will continue to alter environmental conditions in reservoirs.

GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												In this short communication, we report on dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations from a summer stream monitoring campaign at the main hydrological catchment of the Tarfala Research Station in northern Sweden. Further, we place these unique high-alpine observations in the context of a relevant subset of Sweden's national monitoring programme. Our analysis shows that while the monitoring programme (at least for total organic carbon) may have relatively good representativeness across a range of forest coverages, alpine/tundra environments are potentially underrepresented. As for dissolved inorganic carbon, there is currently no national monitoring in Sweden. Since the selection of stream water monitoring locations and monitored constituents at the national scale can be motivated by any number of goals (or limitations), monitoring at the Tarfala Research Station along with other research catchment sites across Fennoscandia becomes increasingly important and can offer potential complementary data necessary for improving process understanding. Research catchment sites (typically not included in national monitoring programmes) can help cover small-scale landscape features and thus complement national monitoring thereby improving the ability to capture hot spots and hot moments of biogeochemical export. This provides a valuable baseline of current conditions in high-alpine environments against which to gauge future changes in response to potential climatic and land cover shifts.

No data exist from low-radient sand-bed streams that largely differ in the morphological and hydraulic factors proposed to affect deposition. TO identify physical control on particle deposition in low-gradient streams, we assessed deposition of very fine and ultra fine organic particulate matter in IS sand-bed stream reaches. We added particles derived from lake sediment and assessed the mean transport distance S-p and the deposition velocity nu(dep) Additionally, reach hydraulics were estimated by injections of a conservative solute tracer (NaCl). Among the low-gradient streams, particle deposition kinetics were variable but similar to deposition in mountain streams. Sp was solely related to the flow velocity. This relation was confirmed when comprising published data on deposition of fine organic particles. An association between particle deposition and transient storage factors was insignificant. We found significance of the transient storage to Sp only for repeated measures within a single reach, when flow velocity and benthic conditions were nearly constant. Measured nu(dep)/nu(fall) ratios were much larger than unity in most reaches. Evidence from this relation suggests that the vertical transport of very fine and ultra fine organic particulate matter through the water column was caused mainly by vertical mixing.

J	Kry, PR				Kry, PR			Heave induced aquifer water level fluctuations	JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY					51st Annual Technical Meeting at the Canadian International Petroleum Conference	JUN 04-08, 2000	CALGARY, CANADA					Abnormal water level fluctuations in Quaternary aquifers have been evident since early 1994 in parts of the Cold Lake Field undergoing Cyclic Steam Stimulation in the Clearwater. In other areas, no responses to steaming operations have been observed. Recent high resolution seismic of the Quaternary has demonstrated a complicated geology, with ice thrusting events leading to isolation of parts of the aquifers into small pockets. Coupling this geological observation with poro-elastic modelling of the effects of Clearwater dilation caused by steaming and subsequent recompaction by production has led to an explanation of the observed water level fluctuations. The mechanism causing water level rises is compression of a pocket of aquifer sand, due to Clearwater dilation as a result of steam injection. For aquifer pockets directly over the steam injection location, aquifer dilation, rather than compression, results from the Clearwater dilation, causing water levels to fall. Aquifer sands that are extensive allow pressure equilibration and no apparent water level changes due to nearby Clearwater dilation. Net injection to the Clearwater appears to be a significant correlative indicator of Clearwater dilation, but sensitivity of the aquifer water level change to net injection decreases with successive steam cycles. First principle numerical simulations coupling fluid flow and formation stress-strain behaviour support the relationships developed.																			0021-9487					SEP	2001	40	9					23	28																WOS:000171353100006

The importance of this aquifer lies in its location on the sub-continental divide, which separates the Mississippi River Basin from the Great Lakes Basin, and its proximity to one of the largest surface water bodies, Lake Michigan. The groundwater aquifer model incorporating 4 layers and 18 different geologic zones simulated the influence of recharge on the local-flow regime by utilizing recharge estimates from the Soil-Water-Balance Code. The steady-state simulation revealed that groundwater head in general was decreased toward the Lake Michigan with local variation caused by stream networks. In response to 2012 drought event, groundwater drawdown was not rehabilitated until spring 2013, implying that the aquifer required approximately 3-4 months until responding to meteorological drought. Additionally, variation in recharge caused to change in groundwater table throughout the entire aquifer simultaneously, but the effect of Lake Michigan stage on groundwater table was relatively minimal. Finally, a certain portion of streams in the Cedar Creek Watershed could be ephemeral. Switching from the RIVER to the DRAIN package for the implementation of ephemeral river and stream cells resulted in significant reduction of both groundwater head and flux, implying that realistic distribution of present groundwater head would resemble one simulated between RIVER and DRAIN packages.

Highest delta O-18(diatom) values are found during MIS 11.3, highlighting the dominance of hydrological input from rivers flowing into the south and central basins of Lake Baikal, especially the Selenga River. Hydrological input from south basin rivers dominated for over 30 ka. However, there is evidence from both biogenic silica and delta O-18(diatom) records for an abrupt cooling event at ca. 390 ka BP. Stadial conditions at this time are coincident with an iceberg discharge event into the North Atlantic. The decline in delta O-18(diatom) values suggests increasing proportion of hydrological input from rivers to the north of Lake Baikal, due to greater influence of winter precipitation and snow-melt. After a period of interstadial conditions during the early stages of MIS 11.1, biogenic silica and delta O-18(diatom) values decline, mirroring the slow growth in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Despite rigorous cleaning procedures, palaeoclimatic inferences need to be treated with caution due to contamination of the delta O-18(diatom) record; during stadial and glacial periods, contamination of the delta O-18(diatom) record is even more significant.

GLACIAL LAKE SCHOHARIE: AN INVESTIGATIVE STUDY OF GLACIOLACUSTRINE LITHOFACIES IN CAVES, HELDERBERG PLATEAU, CENTRAL NEW YORK	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												The glacially deranged karst topography of the Helderberg Plateau, central New York, contains glaciolacustrine lithofacies deposited at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. Eight pre-glacial caves (Barrack Zourie Cave, McFail's Cave, Howe Caverns, Secret Caverns, Bensons Cave, Gage Caverns, Schoharie Caverns, and Caboose Cave), containing a unique sediment section, are located within the footprint of Glacial Lake Schoharie, Schoharie County. The lithofacies consist of three individual facies, stratigraphically uniform, with the middle facies in sharp contact with the facies directly above and below. This assemblage displays a similar stratigraphic sequence from bottom to top: tan/white to light-grey, very thinly bedded, silts and clays, rich in calcite, overlain by poorly sorted, matrix-supported gravels, in turn overlain by dark-brown very thinly bedded silts and clays. A post-glacial cave within the lake's footprint (Westfall Spring Cave) and a nearby pre-glacial cave outside the footprint (Knox Cave) were found to lack these lithofacies. The tan/white to light-grey sediment facies is interpreted to be a glacial rock flour deposited under stagnant lake conditions that limited fine-grained calcite particle dissolution. The overlying gravel facies were emplaced during lake termination and reestablishment of turbulent epigenic flow in the eight stream caves. The more recent dark-brown facies is perhaps soil-loss deposition following European settlement. Initial interpretations hypothesized that the deposits were laid down under ice-cover conditions, but similar deposits were not found in other glaciated cave settings in New York. The results presented here explain why the unusual tan/white and light-grey glaciolacustrine facies are not found in other caves in the glaciated central New York region, as those areas were not subject to inundation by glacial lake water.																			1090-6924	2331-3714				AUG	2014	76	2					127	138		10.4311/2013ES0117	http://dx.doi.org/10.4311/2013ES0117													WOS:000341539300005

The presence (1) or absence (0) of BMI taxa was established at five sites on each lake, using a kick-and-sweep net technique. Summing presence/absence scores across sites ranked the importance of each taxon in each lake on a scale of 0 to 5. Relationships between the BMI assemblages were assessed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), based upon the Kendall's tau correlation matrix. Correlations between NMDS dimension 1 and 2 scores and environmental variables identified factors that may structure BMI assemblages. The BMI assemblages of three experimentally acidified and seven reference lakes at the ELA were correlated strongly with lake pH. The BMI assemblage structure of central Ontario lakes was predicted by lake area and sensitivity to acidification (NMDS dimension 1) and by lake elevation (NMDS dimension 2). The BMI assemblages of small or Ca-poor and acidic lakes include fewer oligochaetes, mayflies, and Cryptochironomus and Stictochironomus (chironomids) and more Odonata, Trichoptera, Chironomus, Conchapelopia, Microtendipes, and Procladius (chironomids), and Crangonyx (Amphipoda) than other central Ontario lakes.																			0706-652X					MAY	1994	51	5					1147	1161		10.1139/f94-114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-114													WOS:A1994PA36700016
J	Jin, ZD; You, CF; Yu, JM				Jin, Zhangdong; You, Chen-Feng; Yu, Jimin			Toward a geochemical mass balance of major elements in Lake Qinghai, NE Tibetan Plateau: A significant role of atmospheric deposition	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Sediments in Lake Qinghai archive important information about past environmental changes. In order to faithfully interpret the sediment records and constrain the elemental cycles, it is critical to trace various sources of sediments in the lake. The results show that the elemental input-output budgets are imbalanced for most major elements between riverine fluxes and mass accumulation rate (MAR) of Lake Qinghai sediments. A realistic model must include contributions of dry/wet atmospheric deposition that allow the major element mass balance for the lake to be defined. The budget estimation is based on mass balances of Si and Al, which are relatively immobile and carried to the lake via particulate forms. Estimated annual budget of dry atmospheric deposition is similar to 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) kt/a (accounting for similar to 65% of the total inputs) to the lake sediments. assuming local loess within the catchment as a candidate for dry atmospheric deposition to the lake. The resultant flux of 300 45 g/m(2)/a falls within the flux average of the desert area (400 g/m(2)/a) and the loess plateau (250 g/m(2)/a), consistent with the geographical setting of Lake Qinghai. The role of atmospheric deposition would be more significant if wet deposition via rainfall and snow were taken into account. This highlights the potential importance of dust as a significant source for sediment preservation flux for other catchments worldwide. The results also indicate that nearly all Ca input was preserved in the lake sediments under modem conditions, consistent with Ca(2+) Supersaturation of the lake water. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface water (weekly sampling) and precipitation (daily measurement) are monitored at 6 calibrated catchments, 5 located in southern Norway and 1 in northernmost Norway close to the Russian border. Ground water (weekly sampling) is monitored in 4 reservoirs in Southern Norway. 73 lakes located all over Norway are surveyed each fall. Nineteen rivers in western and southern Norway are monitored by monthly sampling. All sites are considered sensitive to acidification and are chosen to minimise the effects of anthropogenic catchment based impacts. Results from the monitoring over the period 1980-1994 show that there is a reduction of sulphate of about 25-35% in surface waters which is related to a 30-45% reduction in sulphate concentration in precipitation. An improvement in water quality as measured as increase in ANC has only been apparent since 1990. Due to heavy seasalt episodes in the most coastal catchments like Birkenes and the dyers in western Norway, there has been no improvement of ANC since 1980. Deposition of nitrogen has not changed over the last 10 years, and there is no change in the levels of nitrate in the monitored surface waters.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					629	634		10.1007/BF00476899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476899													WOS:A1995UB05300057
J	BOUTIN, R; ROBITAILLE, G				BOUTIN, R; ROBITAILLE, G			INCREASED SOIL NITRATE LOSSES UNDER MATURE SUGAR MAPLE TREES AFFECTED BY EXPERIMENTALLY-INDUCED DEEP FROST	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												This work reports and discusses data gathered during soil solution monitoring that was part of an experiment conducted in the Duchesnay Experimental Forest (Quebec, Canada) to study the effects of induced deep frost, superficial frost, and superficial frost plus drought on mature sugar maple trees (Acer saccharum Marsh.). Frost treatment was applied by preventing snow from accumulating under the canopy. Soil solution chemistry was modified when mature sugar maple trees declined after exposure to a severe deep frost. The first vegetation period after treatment showed that losses of NO3- below the rooting zone were greatly increased under affected trees. The leaching rate of NO3- and basic cations was directly related to the level of change in canopy dieback and transparency. A mean NO3- concentration of 630 mu mol(c) . L(-1) (53 times the controls; max. 4500 mu mol(c) . L(-1)) was measured in soil solution under the deep frost treated trees. The leaching rate of K+ (18X, relative to the control) and Mn2+ (11X) was higher than that of Mg2+ (5X) and Ca2+ (2.6X). Acidification of the soil solution (50% more H+) as a result of intense nitrification caused an increase in aluminum concentration (5X) and a decrease in SO42-. The acidification during the year after treatment was equivalent to decades of atmospheric acid deposition. The seasonal mean of SO42- did not differ between treatments, but there was evidence of a significant correlation between pH and SO42- in soil solution. Concentration of NH4+ was also enhanced but to a lesser degree (10X) than that of NO3-. Specific conductivity was a good predictor of NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and total Al in soil solution. The ion balance shifted from an anion deficit to a strong cation deficit when NO3- concentrations were high. Superficial frost with or without induced summer drought did not cause any significant change in soil solution chemistry compared with the controls. These results indicated the necessity to consider perturbations induced by extreme climate conditions, like deep soil frost, for the interpretation of soil solution chemistry data in the context of acid deposition studies and forest health.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				APR	1995	25	4					588	602		10.1139/x95-066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x95-066													WOS:A1995RC04400007

Four cumulus parameterizations and three spectral nudging techniques applied to moisture are evaluated based on 2-m temperature and precipitation accumulation in the Great Lakes drainage basin (GLDB). Results are compared to a control simulation without spectral nudging, and additional analysis is presented showing the contribution of each nudged variable to temperature, moisture, and precipitation. All but one of the RCM test simulations have a dry precipitation bias in the warm months, and the only simulation with a wet bias also has the least precipitation error. It is found that the inclusion of spectral nudging of temperature dramatically improves a cold-season cold bias, and while the nudging of moisture improves simulated annual and diurnal temperature ranges, its impact on precipitation is complicated. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Global climate models are vital to understanding our changing climate. While many include a coarse representation of the Great Lakes, they lack the resolution to represent effects like lake effect precipitation, lake breeze, and surface air temperature modification. fi cation. Therefore, using a regional climate model to downscale global data is imperative to correctly simulate the land-lake-atmosphere feedbacks that contribute to regional climate. Modeling precipitation is particularly important because it plays a direct role in the Great Lakes' water cycle. The purpose of this study is to identify the configuration figuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model that best simulates precipitation and temperature in the Great Lakes region by testing cumulus parameterizations and methods of nudging the regional model toward the global model.

Factors affecting year-class strength and growth of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in impounded lakes as revealed by otolith chronologies	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Recruitment and growth rates for lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) inhabiting the Smallwood Reservoir, Labrador, Canada, were influenced by facets of its creation and the temporal variability in water levels associated with its operation. Filling of the reservoir between 1971 and 1974 created a concurrent increase in lake whitefish recruitment above long-term averages. In addition, recruitment was influenced by winter drawdown levels: higher water levels during February enhanced recruitment, accounting for an additional 10% of the long-term variation in recruitment. Using otolith increments as a growth index, the authors determined that growth was influenced by reservoir creation. Growth rates during the initial period of flooding (1971-1975) exceeded long-term averages and were greater than those in any other 5-year period between 1965 and 1995. Growth rate increases were attributed to a simultaneous zooplankton bloom. After exceptional growth, lake whitefish showed a period (1976-1980) when growth rates decreased. The authors developed a quantitative technique using otoliths as an index to establish chronologies of fish growth rates. The index can be used to quantify and assess the impacts of reservoir hydrology on fish populations.																				1095-8649				JUN	2022	100	6					1510	1527		10.1111/jfb.15062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15062		MAY 2022						35420164					WOS:000789979800001

Stuckenia pectinata densely colonised the marginal area of a shallow coastal lagoon Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere) before its removal by the 1968 "Wahine" storm. This study aims to understand the current light availability for S. pectinata growth in Te Waihora with high turbidity and water level fluctuations. In a green-house experiment, acclimations in S. pectinata to lower light intensities involved elongation in stems and leaves, and an increase in photosynthetic efficiency per unit dry weight for both leaves and stems. However, these acclimations did not reduce the daily compensation irradiance (under which daily net photosynthesis equals zero) that was identified at 8.8 +/- 0.9 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Subsequently, we estimated light compensation depth (LCD), based on the derived daily compensation irradiance, incident irradiance at the water surface, and light attenuation coefficients for the lake. In areas shallower than LCD, there is no light limitation for the growth of S. pectinata. The LCD ranged from 0.23 to 0.54 m and well explained the growth range of S. pectinata in Te Waihora during the 2016-2017 ecological survey. The estimated LCD also suggests low turbidity levels in early spring are critical for the growth of S. pectinata with the current water level fluctuation regimes. LCD is a useful parameter for understanding the growth of submerged macrophytes in shallow turbid lakes from the perspective of light availability.					; Hu, Qian/JXX-8006-2024	Turnbull, Matthew/0000-0002-3433-5859; Hu, Qian/0000-0002-6418-9100; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				JUN	2019	156						57	64		10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.04.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.04.005													WOS:000470952800007

CAVITY-NESTING WASPS AND BEES (HYMENOPTERA) OF CENTRAL NEW YORK STATE: FINGER LAKES NATIONAL FOREST	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												During the summers of 2011 through 2013, we used trap-nests to survey assemblages of solitary cavity-nesting Hymenoptera and their nest associates, at two sites within Finger Lakes National Forest in central New York State. The 525 occupied trap-nests produced >2,000 identifiable offspring. Nest-provisioners included 13 species of wasps (Sphecidae, Crabronidae, Vespidae, Pompilidae), of which the most common were Isodontia mexicana, Trypoxylon lactitarse, and Ancistrocerus antilope. Of the 14 species of nest-provisioning bees (Megachilidae, Colletidae), the most frequent nest occupants were Megachile campanulae, Hylaeus annulatus, Osmia pumila, and Osmia cornifrons. The most prevalent natural enemies of nesting species were Coelioxys modesta (in M. campanulae nests), sarcophagid flies (in nests of several wasp species), and Leucospis affinis (in megachilid bee nests). The study documents the presence of 10 species not found associated with trap-nests in our previous two surveys in the Finger Lakes region: Isodontia auripes, Euodynerus leucomelas, Trypoxylon tridentatum, Osmia caerulescens, O. cornifrons, Hylaeus modestus, Megachile sculpturalis, Omalus aeneus, Sapyga centrata, and Coelioxys modesta. We review the results of the trap-nesting studies we have conducted in the region since 2001, providing a compilation of data on patterns of nest-size use for the most common species. Overall, our trap-nest studies have now recorded 38 species of nest-provisioning wasps and bees, along with 14 species of brood-parasitic Chrysididae, Megachilidae, and Sapygidae.																			0013-8797					APR	2018	120	2					260	271		10.4289/0013-8797.120.2.260	http://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797.120.2.260													WOS:000432454000004

Laboratory-determined Phosphorus Flux from Lake Sediments as a Measure of Internal Phosphorus Loading	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												Eutrophication is a water quality issue in lakes worldwide, and there is a critical need to identify and control nutrient sources. Internal phosphorus (P) loading from lake sediments can account for a substantial portion of the total P load in eutrophic, and some mesotrophic, lakes. Laboratory determination of P release rates from sediment cores is one approach for determining the role of internal P loading and guiding management decisions. Two principal alternatives to experimental determination of sediment P release exist for estimating internal load: in situ measurements of changes in hypolimnetic P over time and P mass balance. The experimental approach using laboratory-based sediment incubations to quantify internal P load is a direct method, making it a valuable tool for lake management and restoration. Laboratory incubations of sediment cores can help determine the relative importance of internal vs. external P loads, as well as be used to answer a variety of lake management and research questions. We illustrate the use of sediment core incubations to assess the effectiveness of an aluminum sulfate (alum) treatment for reducing sediment P release. Other research questions that can be investigated using this approach include the effects of sediment resuspension and bioturbation on P release. The approach also has limitations. Assumptions must be made with respect to: extrapolating results from sediment cores to the entire lake; deciding over what time periods to measure nutrient release; and addressing possible core tube artifacts. A comprehensive dissolved oxygen monitoring strategy to assess temporal and spatial redox status in the lake provides greater confidence in annual P loads estimated from sediment core incubations.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Oudsema, Maggie/0000-0001-8947-2618; 													1940-087X					MAR	2014		85							e51617	10.3791/51617	http://dx.doi.org/10.3791/51617								24637715					WOS:000348606100071
J	Panwar, P; Williams, TJ; Allen, MA; Cavicchioli, R				Panwar, Pratibha; Williams, Timothy J.; Allen, Michelle A.; Cavicchioli, Ricardo			Population structure of an Antarctic aquatic cyanobacterium	MICROBIOME												Background: Ace Lake is a marine-derived, stratified lake in the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica with an upper oxic and lower anoxic zone. Cyanobacteria are known to reside throughout the water column. A Synechococcus-like species becomes the most abundant member in the upper sunlit waters during summer while persisting annually even in the absence of sunlight and at depth in the anoxic zone. Here, we analysed similar to 300 Gb of Ace Lake metagenome data including 59 Synechococcus-like metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to determine depth-related variation in cyanobacterial population structure. Metagenome data were also analysed to investigate viruses associated with this cyanobacterium and the host's capacity to defend against or evade viruses. Results: A single Synechococcus-like species was found to exist in Ace Lake, Candidatus Regnicoccus frigidus sp. nov., consisting of one phylotype more abundant in the oxic zone and a second phylotype prevalent in the oxic-anoxic interface and surrounding depths. An important aspect of genomic variation pertained to nitrogen utilisation, with the capacity to perform cyanide assimilation and asparagine synthesis reflecting the depth distribution of available sources of nitrogen. Both specialist (host specific) and generalist (broad host range) viruses were identified with a predicted ability to infect Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus. Host-virus interactions were characterised by a depth-dependent distribution of virus type (e.g. highest abundance of specialist viruses in the oxic zone) and host phylotype capacity to defend against (e.g. restriction-modification, retron and BREX systems) and evade viruses (cell surface proteins and cell wall biosynthesis and modification enzymes). Conclusion: In Ace Lake, specific environmental factors such as the seasonal availability of sunlight affects microbial abundances and the associated processes that the microbial community performs. Here, we find that the population structure for Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus has evolved differently to the other dominant phototroph in the lake, Candidatus Chlorobium antarcticum. The geography (i.e. Antarctica), limnology (e.g. stratification) and abiotic (e.g. sunlight) and biotic (e.g. microbial interactions) factors determine the types of niches that develop in the lake. While the lake community has become increasingly well studied, metagenome-based studies are revealing that niche adaptation can take many paths; these paths need to be determined in order to make reasonable predictions about the consequences of future ecosystem perturbations.					; Panwar, Pratibha/JFJ-6910-2023	Allen, Michelle/0000-0002-8852-1454; Panwar, Pratibha/0000-0002-7437-7084; Williams, Timothy/0000-0002-2738-3019													2049-2618					DEC 2	2022	10	1							207	10.1186/s40168-022-01404-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-022-01404-x								36457105					WOS:000893094500002

The chemical composition of waters and values of total microbial count (TMC), organotrophic bacteria (OB), and bacterial production (BP) depended on the geographical position, length of the rivers, and their water quality. In rivers with water acidification, we did not detect an effect of pH on TMC, abundance of OB, or total amount of mesophilic aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms (PC). In rivers with a discharge of untreated domestic sewage, there was an increase in the content of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), concentration of nutrients, number of fecal and mesophilic bacteria, and high metabolic activity of microorganisms. The value of bacterioplankton production reached 0.26 to 12.41 per day(-1); TMC - 0.155 +/- 0.002 to 3.474 +/- 0.044 million cells/mL. Using the massive parallel sequencing of fragments encoding the V2-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, we studied the diversity of bacteria and estimated the influence of chemical composition on the diversity of communities. As in other freshwater ecosystems and the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal, the members of freshwater Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia predominated in the estuaries and estuarine waters of the rivers. The obtained data on the number and diversity of hygiene indicator bacteria suggested fecal pollution of the rivers of Southern Baikal. (C) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

EUTROPHICATION AND ARSENIC SPECIATION IN LAKE WATERS	EUTROPHICATION: ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS, SOURCES, PREVENTION AND REVERSAL	Environmental Science Engineering and Technology											Arsenic (As) is widely distributed in aquatic environments in various forms. In natural waters, the dominant inorganoarsenicals (iAs) are incorporated into microorganisms such as phytoplankton, and are converted to methylarsenicals and/or more high order organoarsenicals. In addition, the organoarsenicals are mineralized to iAs and methylarsenicals by bacteria. The cycling of As species would depend on the bioactivity of organisms. Microorganisms, such as phytoplankton and organisms of higher trophic levels, produce methylarsenicals in natural waters with maximum concentrations in summer. The degradation and mineralization of organoarsenic compounds are thought to depend mostly on bacterial activities, which influence the As cycling in aquatic environment. Arsenic metabolism in aquatic organisms results in the occurrence of thermodynamically unstable arsenite and methylarsenic compounds in natural waters. The inorganic forms (As(V) and As(III)) and the methylated forms (methylarsonic acid (CH3AsO(OH)(2)); MMAA(V) and dimethylarsinic acid ((CH3)(2)AsO(OH)); DMAA(V)) are the main arsenic species present in natural waters. Although the predominant form of methylarsenicals is consistently DMAA(V) followed by MMAA(V), the existence of trivalent methylarsenic species in the environment has also been reported. Researchers reported the correlation between As(III)/methylarsenicals and chlorophyll-a concentrations and/or phytoplankton density, while others found that the seasonal changes of DMAA concentration is related to the temperature rather than the biological activity of phytoplankton. Eutrophication increases the concentration of nutrient salts and multiplies the primary producers, such as phytoplankton, in lake water. Lakes progress through the oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic process in the natural environment, and these transitions are very slow. Recently, the transition speed became faster because of discharged pollutants and nutrients from human activities, and the eutrophication affects the As circulation in lakes. Very recently, reports showed that the eutrophication influences As speciation in lake water too. In this chapter, the influence of eutrophication on arsenic speciation will be discussed.

The effectiveness and resilience of phosphorus management practices in the Lake Simcoe watershed, Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Uncertainty surrounding future climate makes it difficult to have confidence that current nutrient management strategies will remain effective. This study used monitoring and modeling to assess current effectiveness (% phosphorus reduction) and resilience (defined as continued effectiveness under a changing climate) of best management practices (BMPs) within five catchments of the Lake Simcoe watershed, Ontario. The Integrated Catchment Phosphorus model (INCA-P) was used, and monitoring data were used to calibrate and validate a series of management scenarios. To assess current BMP effectiveness, models were run over a baseline period 1985-2014 with and without management scenarios. Climate simulations were run (2070-2099), and BMP resilience was calculated as the percent change in effectiveness between the baseline and future period. Results demonstrated that livestock removal from water courses was the most effective BMP, while manure storage adjustments were the least. Effectiveness varied between catchments, influenced by the dominant hydrological and nutrient transport pathways. Resilience of individual BMPs was associated with catchment sensitivity to climate change. BMPs were most resilient in catchments with high soil water storage capacity and small projected changes in frozen-water availability and in soil moisture deficits. Conversely, BMPs were less resilient in catchments with larger changes in spring melt magnitude and in overland flow proportions. Results indicated that BMPs implemented are not always those most suited to catchment flow pathways, and a more site-specific approach would enhance prospects for maintaining P reduction targets. Furthermore, BMP resilience to climate change can be predicted from catchment physical properties and present-day hydrochemical sensitivity to climate forcing.

This multi-proxy stacked record reveals the evolution of an incipient water body subjected to warm and dry conditions from similar to 900 to 770 cal yr BP, an interval that is coeval with the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) period. Vegetation was dominated locally by Typha, and regionally by the Espinal, represented by Celtis, along with psammophytic-halophytic communities in sand dunes and lowlands. After that, variable water-depths and unstable conditions occurred in the water body in relation to dry and humid climatic phases until similar to 200 cal yr BP, likely related to a transition from warm and dry conditions, corresponding to the MCA, to a colder and wet climatic setting during a period concurrent with the Little Ice Age (LIA). This water body evolved into a shallow lake since then, with a more stable and higher water level, and regional vegetation characterized by the Espinal and psammophytic-halophytic communities mantling and stabilizing the nearby sand dunes. This evolution suggests complex hydrological responses of LN likely associated with its sensitivity to climatic variability. Our results highlight important contrasts in hydrologic balance during the MCA and LIA along the western and northeastern Pampas, suggesting important shifts mainly in the South-American Summer Monsoon at centennial timescales over the last millennium.					; Schäbitz, Frank/ABE-5116-2020	Schaebitz, Frank/0000-0003-3879-9308; vilanova, isabel/0000-0002-8327-5207; Schittek, Karsten/0000-0002-2135-7856; 													0077-7749					AUG	2015	277	2					209	224		10.1127/njgpa/2015/0502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/njgpa/2015/0502													WOS:000359293000008

The development of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and reservoirs has a major impact on the provision of these services, particularly limiting their use for recreation and water supply for drinking and spray irrigation. Nutrient enrichment is thought to be the most important pressure responsible for the widespread increase in cyanobacterial blooms in recent decades. Quantifying how nutrients limit cyanobacterial abundance in lakes is, therefore, a key need for setting robust targets for the management of freshwaters. Using a data set from over 800 European lakes, we highlight the use of quantile regression modelling for understanding the maximum potential capacity of cyanobacteria in relation to total phosphorus (TP) and the use of a range of quantile responses, alongside World Health Organisation (WHO) health alert thresholds for recreational waters, for setting robust phosphorus targets for lake management in relation to water use. The analysis shows that cyanobacteria exhibit a nonlinear response to phosphorus with the sharpest increase in cyanobacterial abundance occurring in the TP range from about 20gL1 up to about 100gL1. The likelihood of exceeding the World Health Organisation (WHO) low health alert' threshold increases from about 5% exceedance at 16gL1 to 40% exceedance at 54g L1. About 50% of the studied lakes remain below this WHO health alert threshold, irrespective of high summer TP concentrations, highlighting the importance of other factors affecting cyanobacteria population growth and loss processes, such as high flushing rate. Synthesis and applications. Developing a more quantitative understanding of the effect of nutrients on cyanobacterial abundance in freshwater lakes provides important knowledge for restoring and sustaining a safe, clean water supply for multiple uses. Our models can be used to set nutrient targets to sustain recreational services and provide different levels of precaution that can be chosen dependent on the importance of the service provision.

This research aims to develop a predictive hydrological model that can forecast water levels in Vrana Lake to serve as a tool for the sustainable management of water supply systems. Therefore, in this paper, a data-driven predictive model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented. For this purpose, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN architecture is chosen. For model development, the monthly data of rainfall amount, evaporation, losses, water supply pumping, and lake water levels at Vrana Lake from the years 1954-2022 were used, and the model for water level prediction is developed for time prediction steps: (i) Delta t = 1 month, (ii) Delta t = 2 months, (iii) Delta t = 4 months, and (iv) Delta t = 6 months. The model quality assessment indicated strong prediction capabilities for time steps of Delta t = 1 month and Delta t = 2 months. However, the models for time steps of Delta t = 4 months and Delta t = 6 months exhibited lower quality. Despite this, they can still serve as valid indicators for predicting trends in water level fluctuations.

PREVALENCE OF AVIAN PARAMYXOVIRUS 1 AND AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS IN DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS (PHALACROCORAX AURITUS) IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												Although it is well established that wild birds, such as cormorants, carry virulent avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1; causative agent of Newcastle disease) and avian influenza virus (ATV), the prevalence of these viruses among Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the Great Lakes region of North America has not been rigorously studied. We determined the prevalences of APMV-1 and AIV in Double-crested Cormorants from the interior population of eastern North America. From 2009 to 2011, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and serum samples were collected from 1,957 individual Double-crested Cormorants, ranging from chicks to breeding adults, on breeding colony sites in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Mississippi, USA, and Ontario, Canada, as well as on the wintering grounds of migratory populations in Mississippi, USA. Prevalence of antibodies to APMV-1 in after hatch year birds was consistently high across all three years, ranging from 86.3% to 91.6%. Antibody prevalences in chicks were much lower: 1.7, 15.3, and 16.4% in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. Virulent APMV-1 was detected in six chicks sampled in 2010 in Ontario, Canada. Only one adult was positive for AIV-specific antibodies and five individuals were positive for AIV matrix protein, but the latter were negative for H5 and H7 AIV subtypes. We provide further evidence that Double-crested Cormorants play an important role in the maintenance and circulation of APMV-1 in the wild, but are unlikely to be involved in the circulation of AIV.

The Keg's Back Formation is 14.3 m thick at its type section (Prince of Wales Falls, Ottawa) and thickens eastward to 27 m in Russell County, about 40 km southeast of Ottawa. It consists of lower, dark green shales with thin lime-mudstone and sandstone interbeds, and upper thin to thick beds of fine crystalline greenish grey sandy and calcareous dolostones with thin to medium (10-30 cm) pinkish grey, bioclastic packstone and grainstone interbeds. The latter thicken eastward and correlate with the ''St. Martin calcarenites'' of the Beaconsfield Member, Laval Formation, in the Montreal area. Together, these beds correlate with the Valcour Formation, Chazy Group, in the Lake Champlain area of New York. Conodonts and macrofossils indicate a Chazyan (Llandeilian) age for the Hog's Back Formation. The lower sandstone-shale-carbonate assemblage of the formation indicates sedimentation in peritidal environments, and documents initial regional flooding of nearshore sandy facies of the Rockcliffe Formation. The overlying carbonate facies represent sabkha environments punctuated by storm deposition. The gross shallowing-upward succession of the formation was terminated by renewed flooding associated with another regional transgressive event heralding deposition of the Ottawa Group.					; Dix, George/AAK-4186-2020	Salad Hersi, Osman/0000-0002-7196-235X; 													0008-4077	1480-3313				MAY	1997	34	5					588	597		10.1139/e17-047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e17-047													WOS:A1997XF19700002

Recent developments in high-resolution laser spectroscopy made feasible triple-isotope, high-precision analyses of water samples (delta H-2, delta O-18 and delta O-17). We conducted in-depth, comprehensive assessment of the potential and usefulness of the triple-isotope mass balance approach to quantify water budget of lakes and surface water bodies. A small, groundwater-controlled lake located in the vicinity of Krakow, southern Poland, was selected for this purpose. Approximately 30% higher incoming and outgoing groundwater fluxes derived from H-2-based budget, when compared to O-18- and O-17-based budgets, were obtained when isotopic composition of ambient moisture interacting with the lake was assumed to be in isotopic equilibrium with the local precipitation. Since the ambient moisture interacting with a given lake is in fact a mixture of the vapour released by the evaporating surface water body and the free-atmosphere water vapour, we proposed the procedure to calculate the isotopic composition of this mixture. This approach led to fully consistent triple-isotope mass balance of the studied lake. The underground water fluxes derived separately for the three isotope tracers in use (H-2, O-18 and O-17) turned out to be identical within the quoted uncertainties, thus supporting internal consistency of the obtained results. The magnitude of the calculated fluxes was in the order of 3200 mm year(-1) for the incoming groundwater flux and 3100 mm year(-1) for underground losses of lake water through seepage to the local aquifer. The calculated mean turnover time of water in the studied lake is only ca. 16 months, which guarantees a good quality of lake water, a critical parameter in the light of intensive exploitation of this lake as a popular recreational destination during summer.

Bacterioneuston Abundance and Physicochemical Properties of the Surface Microlayer of Lake Baikal	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The aquatic surface microlayer at the interface between the atmosphere and the hydrosphere occupies 70% of the Earth's surface, covering all water bodies. The surface microlayer is about 50 mu m thick. The special microbial community formed here is referred to as neuston. The total bacterial abundance in the surface microlayer (SML) and underlying waters (UW) of Lake Baikal was studied by epifluorescence microscopy. The physicochemical features of the surface microlayer of Lake Baikal have been established for the first time. SML was sampled throughout all of Lake Baikal in May-June of 2013-2016 and in August of 2013, 2015, and 2016. SML samples were taken from a boat with Garret's metal mesh screen (26.5 cm in diameter) mostly in calm weather. The average values of total bacterial abundance in SML varied from year to year within the range of (0.93-1.49) x 10(6) cells/mL in May-June and (1.73-2.24) x 10(6) cells/mL in August; in the UW (at a depth of about 15-20 cm), these values were 0.79-0.89 x 10(6) cells/mL in May-June and 1.15-1.4 x 10(6) cells/mL in August. There was a significant difference and direct relationship between the total abundances of neuston and plankton bacteria of Lake Baikal in the summer period. The differences in chemical composition between the surface microlayer and the subsurface water layer were revealed in all the seasons under study. The surface microlayer was enriched in total organic carbon, and suspended particulate matter compared to the underlying water layers. There was a direct relationship between bacterial numbers in the surface microlayer and the concentration of suspended particulate matter.

This study aimed to determine the genetic relatedness of isolates responsible for cholera outbreaks in eastern DRC between 2014 and 2017, and their potential spread to bordering countries. Methods/Principal findings Phenotypic analysis and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were carried out on 78 clinical isolates of V. cholerae associated with cholera in eastern provinces of DRC between 2014 and 2017. SNP-based phylogenomic data show that most isolates (73/78) were V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor with CTX-3 type prophage. They fell within the third transmission wave of the current seventh pandemic El Tor (7PET) lineage and were contained in the introduction event (T)10 in East Africa. These isolates clustered in two sub-clades corresponding to Multiple Locus Sequence Types (MLST) profiles ST69 and the newly assigned ST515, the latter displaying a higher genetic diversity. Both sub-clades showed a distinct geographic clustering, with ST69 isolates mostly restricted to Lake Tanganyika basin and phylogenetically related to V. cholerae isolates associated with cholera outbreaks in western Tanzania, whereas ST515 isolates were disseminated along the Albertine Rift and closely related to isolates in South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. Other V. cholerae isolates (5/78) were non-O1/non-O139 without any CTX prophage and no phylogenetic relationship with already characterized non-O1/non-O139 isolates. Conclusions/Significance Current data confirm the association of both DRC O1 7PET (T)10 sub-clades ST69 and ST515 with recurrent outbreaks in eastern DRC and at regional level over the past 10 years. Interestingly, while ST69 is predominantly a locally endemic sequence type, ST515 became adaptable enough to expand across DRC neighboring countries.

Growth of common carp Cyprinus carpio in Anatolia (Turkey), with a comparison to native and invasive areas worldwide	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Common carp Cyprinus carpio occurs in several non-native areas worldwide, where it is generally regarded as either naturalised or invasive. Anatolia (Turkey) represents a unique region for evaluating common carp growth, due both to its location at the southernmost range of expansion of the species' wild form and to most of its water bodies having been stocked with domesticated strains. Based on a review of length-at-age data for common carp stocks from 45 water bodies sampled between 1953 and 2007, regional patterns in growth across climates, water body types, scalation variants and sexes, along with altitudinal gradients in growth performance and mortality, were investigated. Growth rates were lower in cold and arid relative to temperate climates, and also under hot or dry summers; this was true also of the mirror relative to the scale variant, males to females, but not of water body types (i.e., man-made reservoirs, natural lakes, water courses). Growth performance and mortality decreased with increasing altitude and decreasing temperature, likely due to optimisation of resource allocation between growth and reproduction. Growth rate of common carp from Anatolia was consistently lower compared to its native (Eurasian) and, especially, invasive (North American) counterparts, which reflected an opportunistic life-history strategy. Lower growth rates in Anatolia were ascribed to lower resilience of the widespread mirror variant together with limited habitat for spawning in man-made reservoirs. Better knowledge of common carp growth in Anatolia will improve stock management and conservation efforts. Further studies will help clarify the mechanisms responsible for evolutionary genotype-phenotype inter-relationships.					; Jackson, Zachary/T-1337-2019; Ekmekçi, Fitnat/Q-4029-2016; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/C-6263-2012; Tarkan, Ali Serhan/IXD-6486-2023	Jackson, Zachary/0000-0003-3048-2541; Tarkan, Ali Serhan/0000-0001-8628-0514; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-8103-885X; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2015	24	2					165	180		10.1111/eff.12141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12141													WOS:000351349400001

The normal-faulting M-w 5.3 mainshock of 2 September 2017 was widely felt in Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming. Over 1,000 aftershocks were located within the first 2 months, 29 of which had magnitudes >= 4.0 M-L. High-accuracy locations derived with data from a temporary seismic array show that the sequence occurred in the upper (<10km) crust of the Aspen Range, east of the northern section of the range-bounding, west-dipping East Bear Lake Fault. Moment tensors for 77 of the largest events show normal and strike-slip faulting with a summed aftershock moment that is 1.8-2.4 times larger than the mainshock moment. We propose that the unusually high productivity of the 2017 Sulphur Peak sequence can be explained by aseismic afterslip, which triggered a secondary swarm south of the coseismic rupture zone beginning similar to 1 day after the mainshock. Plain Language Summary During the fall of 2017, an energetic sequence of earthquakes was recorded in southeastern Idaho. The mainshock had a moment magnitude of M-w 5.3, yet thousands of aftershocks were detected. We found that the unusually high productivity of this earthquake sequence can be explained by extra sliding that occurred just after the mainshock. This extra sliding happened too slowly to generate seismic waves, but it was large enough to alter the stress in the crust such that the extra aftershocks were created. Our finding suggests that in this region of Idaho, some of the strain that is built up by tectonic forces is released in slow-slip or creep events. This discovery will ultimately lead to more accurate forecasts of seismic hazard in the region.					; Shearer, Peter/K-5247-2012	Pankow, Kristine/0000-0002-2526-8199; Hale, John/0000-0002-6371-8517; Pechmann, James/0000-0002-6726-9640; Benz, Harley/0000-0002-6860-2134; Shearer, Peter/0000-0002-2992-7630; Trugman, Daniel/0000-0002-9296-4223													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 16	2018	45	11					5352	5361		10.1029/2018GL078196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GL078196													WOS:000436249900016

SOCIOCULTURAL FACTORS INFLUENCING DECISION-MAKING RELATED TO FERTILITY AMONG THE KANURI TRIBE OF NORTH-EASTERN NIGERIA	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE & FAMILY MEDICINE												Background: The Kanuri tribe is found in the Lake Chad basin. However, the majority of the tribe lives in Borno State, Nigeria. Before this study was undertaken, factors related to fertility decisions among the tribe were not known. Objectives: This study is aimed at describing and documenting the sociocultural factors affecting decisions related to fertility among the Kanuri tribe. Method: The study applied the qualitative research method. In-depth interviews and focus-group discussions were used as data collection methods. Analysis was done manually. Results: Children among the Kanuri were highly valued and desired irrespective of their gender. The ideal family size, according to most of the respondents, was 16 children. Kanuri men are polygamous and can marry up to four wives in order to form large families. However, it is an abomination among Kanuri women to fall pregnant in quick succession; a phenomenon they termed konkomi. Other reasons for child-spacing were related to child welfare and maternal well-being. Methods for child-spacing included prolonged breastfeeding (Nganji yaye), ornaments in various forms and shapes, spiritual invocations and dried herbs (Nganji Yandeye). Few Kanuri women practiced modern methods of family planning. Conclusion: Trends in fertility among the Kanuri tribe need to be monitored regularly and appropriate measures be taken to introduce and promote modern family planning and child health services to ensure a healthier family life.

Water samples (lakes, streams, spring water and groundwater) for hydrochemical and stable isotopic determination were collected and the main physical-chemical parameters were measured. The combination of stable isotope data with hydrogeochemical techniques was used for the identification of sources and preferential recharge areas to these aquatic ecosystems which allowed the explanation of the lake water origin. The hydrochemical processes which explain Los Padres Lake water chemistry are evaporation from groundwater, CO2 input, calcite dissolution, Na+ release by Ca2+ and Mg2+ exchange, and sulfate reduction. The model that best aligns with La Brava Lake hydrochemical constraints includes: mixing, CO2 and calcite dissolution, cationic exchange with Na+ release and Mg2+ adsorption, and to a lesser extent, Ca/Na exchange. This model suggests that the fractured aquifer contribution to this water body is greater than 50 %. An isotopic-specific fingerprint for each lake was identified, finding a higher evaporation rate for La Brava Lake compared to Los Padres Lake. Isotopic data demonstrate the importance of these shallow lakes as recharge areas to the regional aquifer, becoming areas of high groundwater vulnerability. The Tandilia Range System, considered in many hydrogeological studies as the impermeable bedrock of the Pampean aquifer, acts as a fissured aquifer in this area, contributing to low salinity waters and with a fingerprint similar to groundwater isotopic composition.					; Londoño, Orlando/AAV-4083-2020	Romanelli, Asuncion/0000-0002-9003-396X; Quiroz Londono, Orlando Mauricio/0000-0002-2817-9570; MARTINEZ, Daniel/0000-0002-7640-1754													1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2014	71	4					1953	1966		10.1007/s12665-013-2601-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2601-y													WOS:000330780800038

Romina; Lancelotti, Julio; Marinone, Maria Cristina; Metz, Sebastian; Roesler, Ignacio; Izaguirre, Irina			Differences in bacterial community composition between fish-stocked and fishless lakes from an arid Patagonian plateau	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Bacterial community composition (BCC) can be modulated by different indirect and direct factors. The Strobel Lake Plateau (Patagonia, Argentina) holds natural fishless lakes. Fish introduction in some of these lakes has affected the structure of their zooplankton, phytoplankton and autotrophic picoplankton communities, whereas its effects on bacterioplankton are unknown. Hence, we analyzed BCC to assess the potential effect of fish introduction on this community in lakes of this region. We sampled fishless and fish-stocked lakes during three summer campaigns and analyzed the BCC. Our results revealed a contrasting arrangement in the main limnological variables and significant differences in the BCC between fishless and stocked lakes. In fish-stocked lakes, Alphaproteobacteria class had a higher proportion and SAR11_cladeIII was the most abundant amplicon sequence variant (ASV); these lakes also showed a marginally higher mean richness but less exclusive ASVs. Environmental and biotic factors contributed to explain BCC variations. The lower percentage of exclusive ASVs and the closer BCC ordination in a non-metric multidimensional scaling suggest a homogenizing effect in fish-stocked lakes. This study contributes to understand the consequences of fish introduction on the plankton communities in lakes of this invaluable region for biodiversity conservation.
