J	Donovan, LA; Richards, JH; Schaber, EJ				Donovan, LA; Richards, JH; Schaber, EJ			Nutrient relations of the halophytic shrub, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, along a soil salinity gradient	PLANT AND SOIL												Recent water level declines of a saline and alkaline lake (Mono Lake, California, USA) have exposed large areas of former lake bottom substrates that have been sparsely colonized by the halophytic shrub, Sarcobatus vermiculatus. To increase understanding of the interaction of salt and nutrient relations in halophytes we investigated spatial and seasonal patterns of leaf elemental composition and growth for Sarcobatus along an extreme salinity gradient using four sites varying in age since exposure. Soil and groundwater Na and EC increased from non-saline at the site farthest from the Lake to highly saline at the site closest to the Lake. Leaf and stem length growth declined along this same transect. In June, when shoot growth rates were maximal, leaf Na paralleled substrate availability and reached a high of 130 g kg(-1) leaf dry weight near the Lake. Through the remainder of the growing season, plants on the lower salinity site continued to accumulate increasing amounts of leaf Na, whereas plants at the highest salinity site reached a plateau earlier in the season. The similarity of high leaf Na at all sites by the end of the season indicates a dominance of Na nutrition over the entire gradient, and a possible upper bound of Na accumulation and tolerance for this species. In June, Sarcobatus leaf N, P were higher at sites further from the Lake and did not correspond to soil N (total) and P that were highest near the Lake. Leaf K, Ca, and Mg in June also did not match substrate availability, and were low enough to indicate marginal sufficiency for growth. However, the increasing substrate Na did not interfere with K, Ca and Mg uptake based on selectivity coefficients (e.g. (leaf K/leaf Na)/(soil K/soil Na)) that did not decline with increasing substrate salinity. Uptake and transport to leaves, of K and Ca relative to Na, remained proportional to what was in the soil across the entire gradient of soil salinity. Uptake and transport of Mg relative to Na increased dramatically in inverse proportion to declining soil availability near the Lake, indicating that Mg may be a critical limiting factor for tolerance of high salinity sites. The key determinants of Sarcobatus growth and ecological dominance along this extreme salinity gradient (non-saline to highly saline) are the propensity to accumulate large amounts of leaf Na over the entire gradient, and the ability to maintain adequate uptake of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg under highly variable substrate combinations of nutrients and Na.

Assessment of Rusty Blackbird Habitat Occupancy in the Long Range Mountains of Newfoundland, Canada Using Forest Inventory Data	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Rusty blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus), once common across their boreal breeding distribution, have undergone steep, range-wide population declines. Newfoundland is home to what has been described as one of just two known subspecies (E. c. nigrans) and hosts some of the highest known densities of the species across its extensive breeding range. To contribute to a growing body of literature examining rusty blackbird breeding ecology, we studied habitat occupancy in Western Newfoundland. We conducted 1960 point counts across a systematic survey grid during the 2016 and 2017 breeding seasons, and modeled blackbird occupancy using forest resource inventory data. We also assessed the relationship between the presence of introduced red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), an avian nest predator, and blackbird occupancy. We evaluated 31a priorimodels of blackbird probability of occurrence. Consistent with existing literature, the best predictors of blackbird occupancy were lakes and ponds, streams, rivers, and bogs. Red squirrels did not appear to have a strong influence on blackbird habitat occupancy. We are among the first to model rusty blackbird habitat occupancy using remotely-sensed landcover data; given the widespread availability of forest resource inventory data, this approach may be useful in conservation efforts for this and other rare but widespread boreal species. Given that Newfoundland may be a geographic stronghold for rusty blackbirds, future research should focus on this distinct population.					; Warkentin, Ian/AGL-1942-2022	Warkentin, Ian/0000-0003-1205-6506; Powell, Luke/0000-0002-2001-4982														1424-2818				SEP	2020	12	9							340	10.3390/d12090340	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d12090340													WOS:000580001700001

Stable isotopes reveal trophic linkages among fish species utilizing the Orange River Estuary Continuum	FOOD WEBS												The Orange River is one of the longest rivers in southern Africa and one of the most regulated rivers in the world. Its estuary supports diverse marine and freshwater life, yet, ecosystem structure and functioning within the estuary are poorly understood. This study investigated trophic linkages and interactions among dominant fishes through carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope (SI) ratios along a salinity gradient. The five dominant species utilizing the Orange River Estuary Continuum (OREC) included marine Chelon richardsonii, estuarine Gilchristella aestuaria, and freshwater species Labeobarbus aeneus, Pseudocrenilabrus philander and Mesobola brevianalis. Variations in SI ratios were associated with changes in body size, seasonality and salinity. Variability in seasons and the salinity continuum influenced SI ratios. Chelon richardsonii, P. philander and L aeneus occupied the widest isotopic niche in the lower OREC, an indication of generalist feeding behaviour in these species. Mesobola brevianalis had the narrowest isotopic niche, perhaps suggesting more specialized feeding on zooplankton. Isotopic similarity was observed among the five co-occurring species, suggesting trophic overlap, particularly during the high-flow season when environmental variables, productivity and food availability are predominantly freshwater driven and uniform throughout the river estuary continuum. This study is the first to utilize delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses to assess trophic dynamics of dominant species co-occurring in the estuary and estuarinefreshwater ecotone of the lower OREC.

J.			δ18O and δ13C of Cyprideis torosa from coastal lakes: Modern systematics and down-core interpretation	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Stable isotope analyses of ostracod shells are a commonly-used proxy for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Although the fundamental controls on isotope composition of ostracod shells are well understood and, in some instances, quantifiable, the paleoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental interpretation of records from lake sediments depends strongly on the characteristics of individual lakes including the climatic setting, depth, volume, hydrology, aquatic vegetation and catchment properties. This is particularly important for coastal lakes where physio-chemical variations may occur on diurnal timescales. Here, we combine variations in delta O-18(water), delta O-18(ostracod) and delta C-13(ostracod), hourly water temperature, and Mg/Ca-ostracod inferred water temperatures (constraining calcification temperature) to improve palaeoenvironmental interpretation and provide insights into lake carbon cycle. The dataset improves understanding of complex coastal lake site systematics and downcore interpretation of stable isotopes from C. torosa, a geographically widespread brackish water ostracod. The delta O-18(ostracod) values show a complex relationship with temperature and suggest, in most circumstances, that delta O-18(water) is the dominant control on delta O-18(ostracod) . During times of fresher water, delta C-13(ostracod) increases, suggesting increasing aquatic productivity. Above a certain delta O-18(water) threshold however, aquatic productivity begins to decline. The interpretation of delta C-13(ostracod) in some coastal lakes, may therefore be dependent on understanding of the range of expected delta O-18(water). Due to short-term (diurnal to seasonal) variations that cause large ranges in delta O-18(water) and delta O-18(ostracod) , stable isotope analyses of C. torosa should be: (1) undertaken on multiple single shells (2) where carapaces are preserved, paired with trace-element/Ca analyses on the same individual; and (3) undertaken alongside a study of the modern lake system.

Optimizing fishing time: One vs. two-night fyke net sets in Great Lakes coastal systems	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Synoptic surveys of fish assemblages captured using fyke nets typically use a soak time of one night. We questioned whether enough information was gained from maintaining the nets for a second night to justify both the additional effort and the resulting reduction in sites sampled per field season. We compared fyke net catches from one-night and two-night sets at Great Lakes coastal margin ecosystems. Re-setting nets for a second night increased species richness by an average ( SE) of 12 0.06%. This translated to an average of 2.5 +/- 0.25 additional species captured. Ordinations of the assemblage data revealed that one-night and two-night catches from the same site (catch pairs) were much more similar to each other than were catches from different sites: the Kendall's kappa concordance values between one-night catches and their two-night pairs measured along the first three ordination axes were 80%, 88%, and 87%, respectively. Catch pairs plotted more closely, Sorensen's distances were smaller, and assemblages were much more concordant than were pairs of catches randomly selected from different sites. Bootstrap analyses of catch species richness indicated that there was little difference between adding effort by increasing soak time versus adding effort by increasing the number of nets. Our data indicate that one- and two-night sets generally produce comparable assemblage data. For synoptic studies, the increase in statistical power gained by increasing the number of sites sampled will typically be more important than the moderate amount of additional information acquired by fishing sites for a second night.					; Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019	Brady, Valerie/0000-0002-2575-1017; 													0380-1330						2007	33				3		236	244		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[236:OFTOVT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[236:OFTOVT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000254896200016
J	Finston, T				Finston, Terrie			Size, shape and development time are plastic traits in salt lake ostracods of the Mytilocypris mytiloides (Ostracoda:Cyprididae) species complex	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The taxonomy of the ostracod genus Mytilocypris is based in part on characters of shell morphology. Specifically, M. minuta, M. mytiloides and M. tasmanica chapmani lack distinctive internal characters and are differentiated largely on size and shape of the shell. The three taxa also differ in the salinity of the habitats they occupy. A field study showed a steady decrease in adult size, spanning the size range of all three taxa, over the course of a season within single lakes, in association with changing salinity and other environmental variables. The present study was conducted to investigate whether each phenotype could be produced under laboratory conditions of variable salinity. Offspring of the three parental phenotypes were raised under high and low salinity. Regardless of parental type, offspring grew more quickly, but reached a smaller size at high salinity, and grew more slowly, but reached a larger size at low salinity. The shape of the shell was found to have a significant size component. Plasticity in size and shape suggests these are unreliable characters for taxonomy. Accelerated development may be an adaptation to living in an ephemeral habitat, with salinity being one of the cues Mytilocypris uses to gauge habitat duration.																			1323-1650						2007	58	6					511	518		10.1071/MF06162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF06162													WOS:000247612900002

Changes in population characteristics and diet of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) from Nyanza Gulf of Lake Victoria, Kenya:: what are the management options?	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Length frequency data collected from 1998 to 2001 from commercial landings was used to estimate asymptotic length (L infinity), growth coefficient (K), mortality (Z, F, M), growth performance index (phi ') and exploitation rate (E) of Oreochromis niloticus from the Nyanza Gulf of Lake Victoria, Kenya. Studies on the diet of O. niloticus collected by demersal trawl and seining between 1998 and 2000 were also conducted. Length frequency data were analyzed using the FISAT software ( an FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tool package). The L infinity had a mean value (+/- S.D) of 58.78 +/- 2.42 cm TL, K of 0.59 +/- 0.05 yr(-1), Z of 2.16 +/- 0.40 yr(-1), M of 1.00 +/- 0.06 yr(-1), F of 1.12 +/- 0.34 yr(-1), E of 0.48 +/- 0.11 and phi ' of 3.31 +/- 0.04. Length at first entry into the fishery (L-50) was observed at 26.18 +/- 12.50 cm TL. Recruitment occurred throughout the year, with two peaks corresponding with the rainy seasons. A comparison with previous studies in the gulf indicates that O. niloticus is now caught at a smaller mean size, whereas K, Z, and M have increased. Fish appeared to become sexually mature at a smaller size. Nile tilapia originally known to be herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, has diversified its diet to include insects, fish, algae and plant materials, all being important food items. The changes in population characteristics and diet of O. niloticus are discussed in context of changes occurring in the lake and its surroundings.

Only two small remnant populations are known to survive. In a small stretch of the upper Chindwin River K. trivittata persists because local Shan villages traditionally ban the killing of large adult K. trivittata. The population has nevertheless declined dramatically during the last few years because of the erosion of the ban by migrant fishermen from central Myanmar who do not observe the local regulation, and because of the overexploitation of eggs. The traditional regulation of the Shan villages offers a basis, through its reinforcement and education of migrants, for a species recovery programme. Further actions will include the protection of nests and eggs, and eventually the banning of camps and seasonal settlements on sandbanks used by K. trivittata for nesting. K. trivittata also still persists in the Dokhtawady River in a small area subjected to low exploitation pressure in the recent past because of the dangers of a frontline between the government army and an army of insurgents. The opening of this area following a truce brought this population close to extinction and a hydroelectric dam under construction will alter the ecology of this stretch of river. We propose to assess the potential use of the future impoundment lake for the recovery of this K. trivittata population.																			0030-6053					APR	2006	40	2					176	182		10.1017/S0030605306000391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605306000391													WOS:000238205600017

A total of 260 taxa was observed, of which Chlorophyta (106 taxa) contributed the highest portion of the total number of taxa, followed by Bacillariophyta (82 taxa) and Cyanophyta (32 taxa). The total standing crop measured by means of chlorophyll a content, cell density, and cell biovolume, as well as the abundance of the dominant species, declined in the order of Station I to Station IV. Seasonal changes of the standing crop varied greatly among the four stations. Although the cell density at the four stations showed a single peak within a year, the peak density varied from July to November, dependent on the sampling year and the station. For chlorophyll a content and cell biovolume, multiple peaks were observed at Stations I and II, but a single peak was found at Stations III and IV. The phytoplankton community structure indicated that the trophic status was the highest at Station I (most eutrophic), followed by Station II; Stations III and IV were the least trophic areas. The long-term changes in phytoplankton community structure further suggested that changes in phytoplankton community structure were correlated with water quality, and eutrophication of Donghu Lake had been aggravated since the 1950s.

Concentrations of Sigma HCH (sum of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-HCH) and Sigma DDT (sum of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT) varied in ranges of 10.9-3.16 x 10(3) and 37.9-1.53 x 10(3) ng g(-1) dry weight in heating season and in ranges of 6.9-1.12 x 10(3) and 18.6-626 ng g(-1) dry weight in nonheating season, respectively. It was found that HCHs and DDTs concentrations of the most heating season samples were higher than those of nonheating season samples collected from the same sites. Among studied compounds of the HCH family, beta-HCH prevailed in most samples, suggesting a possible volatilization or resuspension from contaminated topsoil. As for DDTs, p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE prevailed in most samples, indicating a possible "fresh" input. Correlations between HCHs/DDTs and total organic carbon and particle size are discussed. Atmospheric deposition fluxes were calculated for the heating and nonheating seasons, and the results showed that the annual input of particulate Sigma HCH and Sigma DDT from air to surface in the studied area of 1.19 x 10(4) km(2) were 89 t and 80 t, respectively.					; Wu, SP/G-3968-2010	Tao, Shu/0000-0002-7374-7063; 													1093-4529	1532-4117					2005	40	9					1715	1730		10.1081/ESE-200068002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1081/ESE-200068002								16134363					WOS:000231388700006
J	Auer, MT; Powell, KD				Auer, MT; Powell, KD			Heterotrophic bacterioplankton dynamics at a site off the southern shore of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Evolution of the paradigm regarding the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous sources of organic matter in aquatic systems has rekindled interest in the role of bacteria in energy transfer. The development of material budget calculations characterizing conditions of net heterotrophy requires knowledge of spatiotemporal dynamics in the bacterial community. Here we present results from three years of measurement of bacterioplankton abundance and production at three locations on the south shore of Lake Superior. In general, bacterial numbers (0.63 X 10(6) +/- 0.29 x 10(6) cells center dot mL(-1)) and production (0. 037 +/- 0.055 mgC center dot m(-3)-hr(-1)) were comparable to those reported previously for Lake Superior and were consistent with the system's place along the trophic gradient. Interannual differences in abundance and production were apparently related to the timing and magnitude of seasonal phytoplankton dynamics. There was no inter-transect variation or systematic nearshore-offshore gradients in bacterial activity despite substantial differences in proximity to sources of terrigenous materials (between transects) and in phytoplankton biomass (with distance offshore). The most striking signals in bacterial activity were those evidenced by peaks in bacterial production associated with the deep chlorophyll maximum and with the decline in the phytoplankton community with the approach to turnover. It is hypothesized that bacterioplankton activity in Lake Superior exists in a near steady state, fueled by labile organic matter produced through phytoplankton excretion and the photolytic processing of refractory terrigenous materials. Superimposed on this rather stable signal are peaks in bacterial production apparently related to senescence of the phytoplankton community and, perhaps, the generation of nutrients by the grazing community.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			214	229		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70387-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70387-1													WOS:000227991500015

The 3 objectives were to (1) characterize the spatial distribution of M rubra patches through time; (2) characterize and model the spatial distribution of M rubra at scales ranging from m to km, and from 1 wk to more than 1 yr; and (3) to place the patchiness patterns of M rubra into an ecological context. Geostatistical analysis was applied to data collected from simple and nested sampling grids in different seasons; autocorrelation analysis was used to detect temporal regularities over 55 wk. Classical statistics were applied to data from 10 sites in the lagoon to identify trends relating ciliate abundance to environmental conditions. Patches were detected and characterized using empirical variograms and modelled by omnidirectional Gaussian and exponential functions. For most of the analysis variance was low in the nugget parameter, indicating a strong spatial resolution of the data, and the range parameter indicated that M. rubra formed patches of 10, 20, 80, 130, and 170 m. Spatial analysis using hierarchical grids produced a more detailed assessment of patches than single grids alone. Conditional simulation of patches indicated the presence of a > 2 km patch covering most of the western lagoon. Patch densities varied from between 4 and 700 cells ml(-1). M rubra abundance exhibited a temporal, pulse-like pattern; autocorrelation revealed a 13 wk periodicity. At the lagoonal level, multiple regression revealed a trend towards higher abundance in the north-west of the lagoon and a decrease during the dry season. Finally, we speculate on the forces causing heterogeneity at large (>1000 m), meso (100 to 1000 m), and fine (1 to 100 m) scales by examining physical-chemical environmental factors and physiological behavioural properties of the ciliate and its potential predators. We propose that M rubra patches originate by fragmentation of larger patches, growth of smaller patches, and physical-behavioural aggregation of cells.

The maximum combined count of single males and pairs (i.e. on any day in any of three census periods in May) provided the best fit with subsequent estimates of breeding success. Nesting success (average brood:pair ratio = 0.52), brood size of older ducklings (mean = 5.7) as well as fledgling success (2.86 juveniles per nesting pair) were higher than in many previous mallard studies. Per capita brood production as well as per capita fledgling production was negatively density dependent, but the latter was not statistically independent of the former. There was no correlation between per capita fledgling success and duckling mortality on a year-by-year basis, hence the density-dependent pattern in breeding success appears to be mediated through variation in nesting success. The number of paired females at the start of the breeding season correlated positively with the production of fledged juveniles the year before.

J	Yurista, PM				Yurista, PM			A model for temperature correction of size-specific respiration in Bythotrephes cederstroemi and Daphnia middendorffiana	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Respiration rates for the cladocerans Bythotrephes cederstroemi and Daphnia middendorffiana were measured over a broad range of temperatures. The data were fit to the model f(degrees K) I W-b where f(degrees K) is a formulation based on enzyme activity as a function of temperature. The enzyme kinetic model better described the biological observations of respiration as a function of temperature than standard empirical models. The results indicate that Bythotrephes has characteristics of a stenotherm and that the arctic Daphnia middendorffiana has characteristics of a eurytherm based on the linear region of Arrhenius plots (where enzymes are fully active). Above 23 degrees C, Bythotrephes was limited by inactivation of respiratory enzymes. Also, below 14 degrees C, enzyme inactivation became signifi cant and not fully compensated for. Daphnia middendorffiana has a temperature region from similar to 10 to 26 degrees C in which the respiratory process was linear on an Arrhenius plot. Temperature-dependent and weight-specific respiration was described for each species with a formulation over a complete range of environmental temperatures. The formulation for temperature inactivation is applicable to ail enzyme processes and should be used in aquatic studies requiring a broad temperature range.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				APR	1999	21	4					721	734		10.1093/plankt/21.4.721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.4.721													WOS:000079726200007
J	MOORE, TR; HEYES, A; ROULET, NT				MOORE, TR; HEYES, A; ROULET, NT			METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS, SOUTHERN HUDSON-BAY LOWLAND	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Methane emissions were measured by a static chamber technique at 39 sites along a transect from the James Bay coast at the southeastern tip of Hudson Bay to Kinosheo Lake, northwest of Moosonee, Ontario, Canada. These sites represented five major wetland ecosystems along a successional gradient from the coast inland. Measurements were made at approximate to 10-day intervals from early June to mid-August, and once in mid-September and mid-October 1990. Seasonal CH, fluxes were small (< 2 g m(-2)) at the recently emerged coastal marsh, coastal fen, tamarack fen, and interior fen ecosystems, except where there were shallow ponds and pools, which emitted 2 - 5 g CH4 m(-2). At the more complex bog ecosystem locations, CH4 fluxes were small (0.3 - 2.0 g m(-2)) from hummock/hollow microtopography in the raised bogs and from the forested margin. The largest CH4 fluxes were recorded from the degrading pest sections forming shallow pools and the moss/sedge mats which were always close to saturation (1.8 - 16.6 g m(-2)). A deeper (1-m water depth) peal emitted less CH4 (1.4 g m(-2)). In terms of ecological succession along the transect, covering emergence over approximate to 4000 yr, CH4 emission rates increase from marsh to fen and bog, primarily through the development of pest degradation and the formation of moss/sedge lawns and pools. There were very weak statistical relationships at each site between the daily CH4 flux and pest temperature and water table. However, there was a significant (r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001) correlation between the seasonal CH4 flux and the mean position of the water table over the complete range of sites, emphasizing the overall importance of hydrology in determining CH4 flux. Laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to determine the capacity of the surface (0 - 20 cm depth) pest samples to produce CH4 anaerobically and consume CH4 aerobically. They revealed that many samples exhibited high CH4 consumption rates, suggesting that although CH4 production in the subsurface pest is high, CH4 emissions from these wetlands to the atmosphere are limited to a large extent by CH4 oxidation in the surface layers of the peat. Trophic status of the pest appeared to have little influence on emission rates, with the highest fluxes in the most acid (pH < 3.5) samples.

The validation was performed using samples from Taihu (n = 13) and Chaohu Lake (n = 21). The results demonstrated that the ETM was the most appropriate to estimate chlorophyll a concentration in highly turbid waters with higher R-2 (0.34 similar to 0.94) and lower RMSE (3.17 similar to 8.70 mu g/L). Furthermore, the lookup table of the molding input parameters was determined for the four seasons in Taihu Lake. The resultant model was applied to MERIS images (8, 9 and 10 waveband) to detect the temporal and spatial variations of chlorophyll a concentration in Tai Lake.

However, the bulk sediment signal is dominated by within-lake processes, whereas the fossil grass epidermal record provides the terrestrial vegetation response to changes in available moisture. The direction of change is similar, but the magnitude and timing of response are different. During the terminal Pleistocene, the aquatic record shows a dramatic, flip-flop behavior (bulk sediment delta(13)C: -4 to -32parts per thousand), while the terrestrial grass epidermis record is much more muted (delta(13)C shifts from -11 to -15parts per thousand). Furthermore, during the transition to the relatively moister conditions of the Holocene, a dominance of C-4 plants persisted for at least 800-1000 years after limnological changes began. On the other hand, the epidermal isotopic record shows a much more dramatic response than that provided by the bulk sediment to the onset of drier, more seasonally contrasted conditions during the late Holocene. These results emphasize the need to consider varying response times of the biogeochemical systems that control the production of proxies, especially when attempting to correlate widely separated records based upon fundamentally different proxies.																			0886-6236	1944-9224				DEC 18	2003	17	4							1121	10.1029/2003GB002072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003GB002072													WOS:000187857900002

Occurrence and relative basal area of 10 species were recorded within an altitudinal range of 200 cm above mean water level along 95 transects. Stepwise logistic regression and canonical correspondence analyses were performed on the overall data set as well as separately for the five geomorphological shore types distinguished (depositional flats, floodplains, beaches, terraces, and rock outcrops). The elevation gradient, representing seasonal floodings, is the main factor determining the distribution of the species. The differences between the geomorphological shore types with respect to composition and arrangement of the arborescent vegetation along the elevation gradient are at least partially explained by surficial substratum, topography, aspect, and fire. Exposure to wave activity seems to be of minor importance only. However, since they are the driving force of erosion and sedimentation, the waves are to a great part responsible for the morphological differentiation of the shoreline. The distribution of the tree species along a characteristic physiographic cross-section is illustrated for each geomorphological shore type.																			0008-4026					DEC	1999	77	12					1744	1755		10.1139/b99-147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b99-147													WOS:000085568800005
J	Ofoezie, IE				Ofoezie, IE			Distribution of freshwater snails in the man-made Oyan Reservoir, Ogun State, Nigeria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The factors influencing patterns of snail distribution in Oyan Reservoir, a typically medium sized man-made reservoir in southwest Nigeria, were investigated once a month, for 28 months (August 1990-November 1992). During each monthly visit, seven stations were sampled for relative snail density, vegetation cover and physical and chemical properties of the lake water. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the influence of these factors on snail abundance and distribution. Seven aquatic snail species were found in the reservoir, namely Bulinus globosus, B. forskalii, B. truncatus, Lymnaea natalensis, Indoplanorbis exustus, Potadoma freethi and Potadoma moerchi. The relative proportion of these species was 17.6% (B. globosus), 16.1% (B. forskalii), 0.2% (B. truncatus), 12.9% (L. natalensis), 23.4% (I. exustus) and 29.8% (both Potadoma spp. combined) of 28 183 snails collected over the study period. The seasonal trends of the species were variable but basically bimodal with peaks in August (rainy season) and November/December (early dry season). These trends were similar to the water level and rainfall patterns, suggesting that seasonal changes in snail density were probably influenced by these factors. Spatial distribution of each snail species was similar along each shoreline but significantly different across the E-W transect. Similar trends occurred for conductivity, dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand suggesting that these factors may have affected snail distribution across shorelines. Ten species of aquatic vegetation were identified, six of which correlated positively and significantly with various snail species. The most important of the associating vegetation was Impatiens irvingii which correlated with all snail species and served as an indicator plant for Indoplanorbis exustus, an introduced snail species in Nigeria.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	1999	416						181	191		10.1023/A:1003875706638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003875706638													WOS:000085130100016

Cultivation of rose is the main economic activity of many villagers in the Lakes region. Rose allergy has not been reported before. We investigated the prevalence of allergy symptoms and specific-IgE immune response due to rose in villagers who had been cultivating rose in Guneykent village in the Lakes region. Methods: A screening questionnaire including respiratory and allergic symptoms was administered to 290 villagers. The investigation team visited and studied 75 randomly selected villagers with an interviewer-administered questionnaire, pulmonary function testing, skin prick testing and serum total IgE. Specific IgE against Rosa rugosa was measured in 41 villagers. Results: Villagers reported asthma/allergy symptoms outside the rose season (17.6%), during the rose season (6.2%), and both during the rose season and outside the rose season (whole the year) (17.6%). Atopy and specific IgE against Rosa rugosa were detected in 12 (19%), and 8 (19.5%) of the villagers tested. Villagers who had symptoms whole the year reported wheeze more frequently than those who reported symptoms only outside the rose season (41.2% vs 11.1%). Conclusions: IgE-mediated allergy could occur due to rose and/or its pollen. Symptoms mainly affect the upper airways. Further studies in the rose handlers, florists and workers of the rose industry would help elucidate the occurrence of rose allergy.					demir, ahmet/I-1957-2014; Karakaya, gül/T-9784-2019														0105-4538	1398-9995				OCT	2002	57	10					936	939		10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.23277.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.23277.x								12269941					WOS:000178080000011

The fractions were: (1) exchangeable and bound to carbonate; (2) bound to Fe/Mn oxide; (3) bound to organic matter/sulfides; and (4) acid soluble. Samples were taken in three seasons and the mean concentration of the elements was calculated. Ten elements were investigated and Cu, Pb and Zn were chosen to discuss in detail. The pollution sources have been identified in a monitoring system. Results were compared to Hungarian soils, geochemical background values, sediment quality values (SQVs) and sediment background values (SBVs). Records showed that the average concentration of elements was usually less than that of SQVs and other data for soils. However, some extremely high concentrations at different sampling sites surpassed the geochemical background values. Most of the elements were found in the acid soluble fraction indicating stable compounds in sediments.

An efficient method of decreasing P losses has been to leave unmanaged buffer zones along forest brooks, streams and lakes. However, the processes controlling P retention by buffer zones are still not fully understood. To assess the importance of forest humus layer in P retention a small-scale survey was carried out at three buffer zones and adjoining clear-cut areas in southern Finland. In general, the humus layer in the buffer zones adsorbed more P than in clear-cut areas and the P adsorption was strongly related to the contents of oxalate extractable iron and aluminium. However, there were indications that the P retention capacity of the humus may decrease with the length of time the clear-cut area or buffer zone has been under the impacts of clear-cutting. There may be significant seasonal changes in humus P retention, but further studies are needed for a critical evaluation of the changes in humus P adsorption between seasons and years. Nevertheless, when compared with the increase in P release after harvest in a boreal forest, the maximum P retention capacity of the humus layer was small. Therefore, the role of the forest humus layer in P retention in clear-cut areas and buffer zones may be insignificant.																			1239-6095					OCT 24	2007	12	5					601	609																WOS:000250660400006

Direct measurements were carried out by gas chromatography and values were calculated from the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and pH. These results were in good agreement. In both cases, the CO2 saturation index was calculated from the carbon dioxide/carbonate/hydrogencarbonate equilibrium in water. An overview estimation of CO2 saturation index will be caused at pH > 7 by neglecting the calcium forming ion pairs with HCO3- and CO32-. The CO2 saturation patterns exhibited seasonal changes in all the lakes investigated which were variable within each trophic group. A direct relationship was found between the increasing trophic state and undersaturation of CO2 during the periods of high primary production. Thus, with respect to the atmosphere, these freshwater bodies act mostly as sources of CO2. Periods of ice covering and clear-water phases are characterized by high CO2 supersaturation and therefore the surface waters investigated are CO2 sources for short periods only.

Nutrients included NO3-N, NH4+4-N, PO4, SiO2, SO4-2, and Cl. Seasonal patterns in most nutrient concentrations were described well by cosine functions. Seasonal descriptions had less variance than discharge related descriptions of nutrient concentrations, possibly due to regulation of reservoir discharge. Differing land-use practices on either side of the reservoir were associated with significantly different nutrient concentrations in their related embayments. The agriculturally dominated western side embayments had lower nutrient concentrations than either the forested eastern side of the reservoir or mainstem sites. Annual average nutrient concentrations did not vary greatly over the 10-year period, indicating no change in eutrophication potential during the sampling period. An exception was a significant decline in SO4-2 levels from 23 mg(.)L(-1) in 1992 to 12.8 mg(.)L(-1) in 1998.

Water exchange half-lives within the plots were measured using rhodamine WT dye (river, t(1/2) = 20 h; cove, t(1/2) = 52 h), and triclopyr dissipation rates were also calculated (river, t(1/2) = 19 h; cove, t(1/2) = 53 h). Triclopyr concentrations were below the proposed potable water tolerance level (0.5 mg/l) within the river treatment plot by 3 days after treatment (< 0.01 to 0.41 mg/l), and 675 m downstream of that plot by 1 day after treatment (< 0.01 to 0.47 mg/l). Following the cove treatment, triclopyr residues ranged from 0.12 to 0.29 mg/l by 7 days after treatment, and from < 0.01 to 0.06 mg/l as close as 150 m downstream from the plot. Eurasian water milfoil biomass was reduced by 99% in the treated plots at 4 weeks post-treatment, remained low one year later (river treatment, 28% of pretreat levels; cove treatment 1% of pre-treat levels) and was still at acceptable levels of control at two years post-treatment (river treatment, 47% of pre-treat levels; cove treatment, 24% of pre-treat levels). The four-week post-treatment efficacy results verified triclopyr concentration/exposure time relationships for controlling Eurasian water milfoil developed under laboratory conditions. Non-target native plant biomass increased 500-1000% by one year posttreatment, and remained significantly higher in the cove plot at two years after treatment. Native species diversity doubled following herbicide treatment, and the restoration of this robust community delayed the re-establishment and dominance of Eurasian water milfoil for three growing seasons.

Husbandry procedures remained constant during the study, e.g., fingerlings were kept in steel tanks and yearlings in both steel tanks and earth ponds. Ichthyobodo necator, Chilodonella hexasticha and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infections were treated with formalin, salt and malachite green-formalin baths, respectively, whenever any parasites were found. Altogether 10790 randomly sampled salmon (Salmo solar), sea trout (S. trutta m. trutta) and brown trout (S. trutta m. lacustris) were studied. Higher prevalences sere found in yearlings than in fingerlings, except in I. necator infections, which were higher in fingerlings (e.g., 26% vs 6% in sea trout). C. hexasticha occurred less often and was found most commonly on brown trout fingerlings. Trichodina nigra a occurred more often in salmon of both age groups and Riboscyphidia arctic in trout. The results show that the occurrence of protozoan parasites in a fish farm is predictable and is influenced by the fish species, the age group of the fish, the season and the tank type. Parasite burden increased up to 7 species per brown trout, e.g., when fish were studied from hatching until stocking at the age of 2 years.																			0020-7519					JAN	1997	27	1					89	99		10.1016/S0020-7519(96)00162-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0020-7519(96)00162-2								9076534					WOS:A1997WL62200011
J	Håkanson, L				Håkanson, L			On the principles and factors determining the predictive success of ecosystem models, with a focus on lake eutrophication models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												If an ecosystem model is tested against an independent set of data, then the achieved r(2)-value (when modelled values are compared with empirical data (y)) will depend on the uncertainty in the empirical y-value (i.e. the uncertainty in the y-direction) and on the structuring of the model, i.e. which processes and model variables are accounted for and the empirical uncertainty of the model variables (i.e. the uncertainty in the x-direction). The aim of this work is to highlight fundamental principles and factors regulating the predictive success of ecosystem models. Three r(2)-values are discussed: (1) the theoretically highest reference r(2) (r(r)(2)), which is defined in this paper as: r(r)(2) = 1 - 0.66 x CV(2), where CV is the characteristic coefficient of variation for the given y-value (CV = S.D./MV; S.D. = standard deviation; MV = mean value); (2) the empirically-based highest r(2) (r(e)(2)), which is determined from a regression when two empirical data sets of y are compared (Emp1 vs. Emp2), and (3) the highest achieved r(2) when modelled y-values are regressed against empirical y-values (r(2)). Ecosystem models can never be expected to yield a high r(2)-value if the target variable (y) cannot be empirically determined well and/or if the model is based on driving variables (x) yielding high coefficients of variation (CV). This work also gives a compilation of characteristic CV-values for many standard lake variables. Monte Carlo simulations (uncertainty analyses) have been carried out to illustrate the practical use of the results using examples with lake eutrophication models. For phosphorus concentrations in lakes, it has been shown that the highest empirically-based r2, ra is 0.85. This value emanates from data from 25 Swedish lakes and is highly dependent on the number, quality and range of the data. The theoretically highest reference r(2)-value to predict phosphorus concentrations in lakes depends on the characteristic CV-value for phosphorus in lakes, which is 0.35, and hence r(r)(2) = 0.92. The lake eutrophication model which has achieved the highest r(2)-value when tested against the widest range of empirical data is the OECD model (OECD, 1982), which gave an r(2) of 0.86. This models is, however, very simplistic and cannot be used to address many important lake management issues. The only way to achieve the highest theoretical reference r(2) of 0.92 for phosphorus concentrations in lakes using mechanistically-based, dynamic models is to structure the model in such a way that it includes no more no less than the most fundamental processes regulating the phosphorus fluxes (like internal loading, stratification and seasonal variation). Such models must also be based on driving variables with a minimum of inherent empirical uncertainties (i.e. small CV-values), and not the opposite, as for most lake eutrophication models used today based on the mean concentration of phosphorus in tributaries, which is one of the most variable of all model variables for lake eutrophication models.

Among 31 of the Wisconsin lakes that contained the milfoil weevil, their abundance varied from non-detectable to 2.5 weevils per stem of Eurasian watermilfoil. No whole-lake characteristics and only some milfoil bed characteristics such as the percentage of natural shoreline, the depth and distance of the Eurasian watermilfoil bed from shore, the number of apical tips and the percentage of broken epical tips per stem of Eurasian watermilfoil, were significantly correlated with milfoil weevil abundance. Twelve Wisconsin lakes augmented with one of three different treatment levels of weevils (1, 2 or 1 weevils per Eurasian watermilfoil stem) showed some significant damage to the Eurasian watermilfoil in small study plots at the end of the first treatment season, Additional sampling to assess longterm effects of this augmentation is ongoing.																			0146-6623					JUL	2000	38				SI		88	97																WOS:000169415800004

SEASONAL VARIATION IN THE POPULATION PARAMETERS OF KINOSTERNON SCORPIODES AND TRACHEMYS ADIUTRIX, AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH RAINFALL IN SEASONALLY FLOODED LAKES	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Seasonally flooded lakes in the northeast region of Brazil are important areas used for breeding and feeding by two species of turtle, Kinosternon scorpioides, the Scorpion Mud turtle, and Trachemys adiutrix, the Brazilian Slider Turtle. Over 6 y, we captured, marked, measured, and determined the sex of 183 K. scorpioides and 518 T. adiutrix. Over the study period as a whole, the sex ratio of K. scorpioides did not deviate significantly from 1:1, whereas there was a significant male bias in T. adiutrix. There was no significant relationship between relative abundance and mean monthly rainfall in either species, although we captured significantly smaller K. scorpioides females and larger T. adiutrix individuals (males and females) in the drier years. Seasonal residence times ranged from 14-90 d in K. scorpioides and 14-110 d in T. adiutrix. Residence time was not related significantly to mean monthly rainfall in either species. In K. scorpioides, the estimated annual female population size ranged from 14 to 78 individuals, while that of the males varied from 16 to 88 individuals, while in T. adiutrix, estimates of the female population size ranged from 71 to 444 individuals, and those of males, from 80 to 515 individuals. These findings indicate that both turtle species maintain resident populations in the study area, but present distinct patterns of annual variation in body size and the sex ratios, which points to distinct ecological requirements that may require differential conservation strategies.					van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Neckel-Oliveira, Selvino/N-5604-2018; Peeters, Edwin/ABC-6307-2022; Roessink, Ivo/O-9350-2014	Neckel-Oliveira, Selvino/0000-0003-3218-5452; Peeters, Edwin T.H.M./0000-0003-2541-1829; 													2151-0733	1931-7603				AUG	2020	15	2					457	466																WOS:000565765000020

Surface energy balance calculations for small northern lakes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												An energy balance model is used to determine diurnal surface energy balance components for three different sized high-latitude Canadian lakes in the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) during the open water seasons of 2000, 2001, and 2002. Sur-face net radiation is derived from the component fluxes of the radiation balance. Turbulent heat fluxes are calculated using the aerodynamic method with input from local meteorological stations and experimentally derived drag coefficients. Lake heat storage, determined as a residual of the surface energy balance, is used together with measured water temperature profiles to calculate the daily mixing layer depth. The model uses readily available meteorological inputs for radiation calculations. Verification results for surface energy balance components show mean bias error (MBE) generally less than 5% of the mean measured daily fluxes and root mean square error (RMSE) less than 38%, which decreases to less than 16% for 10-day averaging periods. The model tends to overestimate net radiation by 7% and latent and sensible heat fluxes by about 4% and 1%, respectively, on average. Inferred slab layer depths indicate that the shallowest lake was isothermal while the deeper lakes showed temporal variations as expected.

Regardless of initial rhizome biomass, both above and belowground biomasses converge on a equilibrium value, with the balance between total production and metabolic loss being latitude-specific. If aboveground biomass is harvested just once, then both above and belowground biomasses return to equilibrium values after several years. If the aboveground biomass is harvested annually, then both above and belowground biomasses converge on smaller equilibrium values, which are determined by the balance between the sum of production prior to harvesting and after harvesting. and the sum of annual metabolic losses and a loss due to harvesting. The model could be used in wetland management activities to predict the potential growth of Typha in given conditions as well as the responses of Typha stands to harvesting over a wide range of latitudes for times ranging from a season to several years.

J	MARTIN, JW; CASHCLARK, CE				MARTIN, JW; CASHCLARK, CE			THE EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE ONYCHOPED CLADOCERAN GENUS BYTHOTREPHES (CRUSTACEA, BRANCHIOPODA, ONYCHOPODA, CERCOPAGIDIDAE), WITH NOTES ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENY OF THE ORDER ONYCHOPODA	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA												The onychopod 'cladoceran' genus Bythotrephes Leydig is reviewed and redescribed based on introduced material of the B. cederstroemi 'form' from the Great Lakes of North America. Reviewed briefly are the systematic history, introduction into North America, and natural history of the genus. Using S.E.M. and light microscopy, we then illustrate a mixture of plesiomorphic and (predominantly) derived features, most of which can be explained as modifications for predation. An emended generic diagnosis includes unique and previously poorly known characters that serve to distinguish Bythotrephes from the confamilial genus Cercopagis, such as a distinctly bilobed labrum, spinose anterior mandibular process, small (exopodal?) spines on the external face of thoracopods 1-3, and a gnathobasic process (proximal endite) on thoracopod 1. A redescription, combined with observations on the external morphology, highlights several morphological peculiarities. These include the strongly bilobed labrum, the loss of one of the original two pairs of maxillae (with a question raised as to which pair has been lost), an unusual point of origin for the 'proximal endite' (termed herein the 'gnathobasic process' because of uncertainty of homology) on thoracopods two and three, a bulbous process of unknown significance located just posterior to the last thoracopod, and the presence of what might be a remnant of the food groove believed to have been present in a hypothesized ancestral group leading to the Onychopoda. The problem of whether Bythotrephes contains one dimorphic species or two species, B. longimanus and B. cederstroemi, is reviewed briefly, and the morphological feature in which these forms differ (the caudal process) is described in detail for the cederstroemi form. Comparison with descriptions of other cercopagidids suggests that Bythotrephes is a highly derived taxon, with short-abdomen genera of the Podonidae and Polyphemidae (e.g., Polyphemus) appearing closer to the onychopod phyletic stem, and with the more closely related genus Cercopagis more derived still. Phylogeny within the Cladocera, and the possible origin of the Cladocera from a cyclestheriid-like ancestor among the spinicaudate conchostracans, is reconsidered. A hypothesis of evolutionary relationships is presented that depicts the ctenopods and anomopods as having arisen from a hypothetical Cyclestheria-like ancestor, with the predatory cladoceran taxa Haplopoda and Onychopoda being derived from the base of the anomopod lineage. Some of the many problems in the suggested phylogeny are discussed.																			0300-3256					JAN	1995	24	1					61	90		10.1111/j.1463-6409.1995.tb00475.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-6409.1995.tb00475.x													WOS:A1995QR26600006

The sediment is fine-grained, well-sorted silt throughout the investigated section. The very high average sedimentation rate (4.5 cm in 3 years, or 1.65 g dry sediment/cm(2) per year) in Morinje Bay, compared to the nearby coastal areas of the Rogoznica lake and the Krka river estuary, may be a result of high aeolian supply of material from the agricultural field of Donje polje, and influenced by the seasonal input from the rapid streamlet Ribnik draining the surrounding area. Concentrations of most trace metals in the Morinje Bay sediments are in the range typical of unpolluted marine carbonates. However, concentrations of Pb, Cu and Zn, in recent and subrecent (down to 50 years before the present) sediments reflect anthropogenic influences. Leaded gasoline seems to be the principal anthropogenic source of Pb enrichment, while Zn and Cu may be of urban and agricultural origin.

Measurements were made accurately and rapidly with a Kodak Ektachem DT60 Analyzer and the Ektachem DTSC Module. Blood serum was collected from both laboratory-reared lake trout (1978 and 1986 year-classes) and feral spawning trout from Lake Michigan and then analyzed in the laboratory. No clinically significant differences were found between samples analyzed fresh and those frozen for 1 or 6 weeks. The ranges in chemistry Variables for feral lake trout were generally wider than those for laboratory-reared lake trout, and significant differences existed between male and female feral lake trout for several tests. Blood chemistry profiles also varied seasonally on fish sampled repeatedly.																			0899-7659					MAR	1999	11	1					81	86		10.1577/1548-8667(1999)011<0081:ABCPFL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8667(1999)011<0081:ABCPFL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000081214300011
J	Cohen, SJ				Cohen, SJ			What if and so what in northwest Canada: Could climate change make a difference to the future of the Mackenzie basin?	ARCTIC												Global climate change, also known as global warming, is one of the most challenging elements of global environmental change. If atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" continue to increase, global mean air temperatures are expected to rise 1.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees C within the next several decades. High-latitude regions are projected to experience above-average increases. What effects would such a warming have in the Canadian Arctic? In a recently completed study of the Mackenzie Basin in northwestern Canada, regional stakeholders provided their responses to the "what if?" scenario of climate change in their region. This scenario includes more frequent landslides due to permafrost thaw, lower minimum annual river and lake levels, more forest fires, and lower yield from softwoods. These impacts could offset potential benefits from a longer growing and ice-free season. Regional stakeholders, including provincial and territorial governments, aboriginal organizations, and the private sector, felt confident about their abilities to adapt, so long as climate change would be predictable and gradual. Some potential impacts, however, could be very significant for renewable resources and aboriginal communities, and some stakeholders spoke of intervention into national and international policy arenas to raise awareness outside of the Mackenzie Basin.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	1997	50	4					293	307																WOS:000071487900003

Over a 12-month period, a simple asymmetric truncated cosine function of day number is used to describe seasonality effects on stream water nitrate concentrations. This is then adjusted to compensate for differences in seasonality effects with catchment elevation. Occurrence of greater proportions of steeper slopes (> 20 degrees-40 degrees) in individual catchments facilitated nitrate leaching, as did increased extent of occurrence of outcropping rocks. It is shown that the spatial and temporal variation in nitrate concentration through the river network studied may therefore be effectively represented by an equation which is a function of day number, % outcropping rock and % of catchment area with a > 20 degrees-40 degrees slope.

Stage-specific development rates and dry weights were measured in the laboratory for the dominant species. Mean total standing biomass estimates for the whole lake ranged from 0.9 to 2.4 g dry wt m(-2). Overall mean biomass for the two years was 1.6 g dry wt m(-2). Total production estimates for the three dominant copepod species ranged from 66 to 210 mg dry wt m(-2) d(-1), with an average annual production of 49 g dry wt m(-2) y(-1). Maximum biomass and production rates were recorded in the south of the lake, although for copepods this was not marked and there was little consistency in their horizontal distribution. Cladocerans, however, were almost always more prevalent in the extreme south of the lake than elsewhere. The temporal pattern of zooplankton production showed marked seasonal variation, with maximum production after the onset of the S. E. trade winds and associated with increases in phtyoplankton abundance.

Gradients in grazer density were created in fertilized cubitainers incubated in situ, and clearance rates on specific phytoplankton taxa determined from regressions of algal growth rates on herbivore biomass. Grazers consumed 3 to 26% of the total phytobiomass present and 22 to 139% of net primary productivity daily. Macrozooplankton fed most heavily on algae 5 to 25 mu m in size and generally selected dinoflagellates and green algae (6 to 26% of biomass removed per day) over cryptophytes (1 to 8%/day), diatoms (0 to 10%/day) and blue green algae (0 to 6%/day). However, variability in grazing vulnerability among the species within divisions was high. Microzooplankton had greater weight-specific clearance rates than macrozooplankton when consuming diatoms, blue-green algae, and cryptophytes, but were less efficient at harvesting green algae. An experiment in which nutrients and zooplankton were manipulated in a 2 x 3 factorial design indicated that both variables have a net positive impact on phytoplankton growth rates in Lake Champlain, the zooplankton because they excrete required nutrients. Indirect effects of the nutrients vs, grazers experiment included rotifer growth in response to increased algal productivity and harvesting of rotifers and Cladocera by cyclopoid copepods. It was concluded that both nutrients and grazing influenced the structure of Lake Champlain's phytoplankton community, but that nutrients were generally more important.																			0380-1330						1999	25	1					61	77		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70717-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70717-3													WOS:000079811600006

The P-fertilized reach of the river is now extensively colonized by 2 bryophytes (Schistidium agassizii and Hygrohypnum spp.), whereas only S. agassizii is common in unfertilized reaches of the river. We compared photosynthesis rates of epilithic algae, S. agassizii, and Hygrohypnum spp. under reference and P-enriched conditions to extend our long-term records of bryophyte dynamics within the fertilized reach and to describe the physiological differences between major primary producers. Rates of primary production were determined from changes in dissolved oxygen concentration during light and dark incubations of algal and bryophyte samples in closed chambers. Net primary productivity per unit total chlorophyll a (CHL, a) was greater for epilithic algae (2.0-6.0 mg O-2 mg(-1) CHLt a h(-1)) than for bryophytes (0.2-1.7 mg O-2 mg(-1) CHLt a h(-1)). However, the greater biomass of the bryophyte community in the fertilized reach yielded area-specific productivity rates for Hygrohypnum spp. that were 2 to 4 times greater than areal rates of epilithic algal productivity. Bryophytes accounted for 80% of primary production in P-fertilized reaches but only 9% in reference reaches. Thus, increased bryophyte abundance in response to P increased total net primary production from 2.3 g C/h to 6.3 g C/h. Photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) parameters obtained by fitting data to a hyperbolic tangent model differed between bryophyte species, between reference and fertilized stream reaches, and over the season. Differences in PI relationships between S. agassizii and Hygrohypnum spp. suggest that they use different life strategies (subsistence vs opportunism respectively) to exist in the arctic environment.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011; Bowden, William/J-9219-2014	Arscott, David/0000-0001-5689-2587; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030; 													0887-3593					JUN	1998	17	2					210	227		10.2307/1467963	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467963													WOS:000075262700006

It is the boundary layer of extreme importance for both environments. In the years 2000-2004 surface water microlayer of an eutrophic, deep lake (577 ha, max. depth 32.2 m, Lake Jasien in Northern Poland) was analyzed (in four seasons each year) in terms of their capacity to accumulate lead, cadmium and manganese. The following surface water layers were collected using the different devices (plate method, net method) and compared: a microlayer of approx. 100 mu m in thickness (SM), a microlayer of approx. 240 mu m in thickness (PM) and subsurface water (about 20 cm below surface) (SSW). The highest concentrations of analyzed metals were observed in the microlayer of 100 mu m, characterized by enrichment factor (EF-ratio of surface to subsurface values) of 2.61 for cadmium, 2.55 for manganese and 1.57 for lead, respectively. Enrichment factors for these metals are much higher than in respective microlayers of brackish lake situated close and studied before. Seasonal changes in concentrations of analyzed elements were correlated with changes in their concentrations in subsurface water. Statistical analysis of results showed that during a year variation in Cd and Mn accumulation in analyzed layers was significant. In contrast, variation in Pb accumulation was statistically non-significant. It means that in the surface microlayer of lake water a seasonal cycle is observed for changes in heavy metal concentrations and this variability in concentrations of analyzed substances is not accidental, but definitely periodical in character. The accumulation of analyzed heavy metals in the surface microlayers of the studied deep eutrophic lake seems to be a regular phenomenon.																			1505-2249						2010	58	4					671	680																WOS:000285679100007

Consequently, the quantification of slope-channel coupling in terms of sediment supply to the river is a major task for fluvial sediment budget studies. Sometimes, the more interesting and useful study sites are located in dangerous areas and field work is difficult, if not impossible. Due to the emerging technology of laser-scanning (both terrestrial and airborne) it is now possible to obtain high resolution earth surface data for use in sediment budget studies. The Reintal Valley (Bavarian Alps) is a natural high-mountain laboratory where sediment transport processes and slope-channel coupling can be studied in detail. Due to a 2005 dam-break flood, the river system is in a state of disequilibrium, making it an exceptional study site for investigating these processes. The sediment flux from the sources to the river channel was quantified by using the innovative terrestrial laser-scanning (TLS) methodology. During the 2008 field season the sediment sources fed the Partnach River with more than 2600 t of sediment. Only a minor part was transported as bed load. Most of the coarse sediment was stored on the channel bed, a finding which was evaluated by concurrent bed load measurements at the outlet of the catchment. The sediment stored on the river bed was re-worked by 2009 snow melt floods and transported further downstream.

Seasonal variations in the concentrations of methyl and ethyl nitrate in a shallow freshwater lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Between February and October 2007, a time series of alkyl nitrate concentrations in the water column of a shallow freshwater lake, University of East Anglia Broad, located in southeastern England was carried out to determine whether methyl and ethyl nitrate are present in freshwater systems and to improve understanding of alkyl nitrate production mechanisms in aquatic environments. Concentrations ranged from 4.7 (+/- 0.5) to 53.7 (+/- 4.36) pmol L-1 methyl nitrate, and 2.5 (+/- 0.3) to 11.1 (+/- 0.4) pmol L-1 ethyl nitrate and were within the range of those measured previously in seawater. Peaks in the concentrations of methyl and ethyl nitrate at 4 m were observed in 9 and 6 of the 18 depth profiles measured, respectively. Gradients in concentrations within the hypolimnion suggest that the alkyl nitrates are produced in the bottom waters or sediments, are transported to the lake in groundwater, or both.

All the analyses were made using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method (ICP-MS). In our investigations we focused on the variability of the element content in water from a number of sampling stations and over different seasons. The obtained results were submitted to statistical analysis. First, the results were interpreted using the analysis of variance test (ANOVA). This has revealed differences in concentration for the majority of elements with regard to seasons. Then, cluster analysis (CA) and factor analysis (FA) were applied to explore similarities between sampling stations. Neither of these have demonstrated any grouping. Finally, factor analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), applied to show the grouping of elements, revealed how different sampling stations are related to each other.					; Baralkiewicz, Danuta/A-6361-2008	Baralkiewicz, Danuta/0000-0002-1186-3552; Komorowicz, Izabela/0000-0002-0037-5908													1093-4529	1532-4117					2010	45	3					348	354		10.1080/10934520903467873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934520903467873								20390876					WOS:000274178700010

Much of this research focuses on natural lakes with very little research in reservoirs. In this study, we provide a contemporary snapshot of the food web structure of Lake Mead to evaluate the contribution of benthic resources to fish consumers. In addition, we document the available food to fishes on soft sediments and changes to the invertebrate community over 2 time periods. Benthic invertebrate food availability for fishes is greater in Las Vegas Bay than Overton Arm. Las Vegas Bay is dominated by oligochaetes, whose biomass increased with depth, while Overton Arm is dominated by chironomids, whose biomass did not change with depth. Diet and isotopic measurements indicate the fish community largely relies on benthic resources regardless of basin (Las Vegas Bay > 80%; Overton Arm > 92%); however, the threadfin shad likely contribute more to largemouth and striped bass production in Overton Arm versus Las Vegas Bay. A 2-time period analysis, pre and post quagga mussel establishment and during lake level declines, suggests there is no change in the density of benthic invertebrates in Boulder Basin, but there were greater abundances of select taxa in this basin by season and depth than in other basins. Given the potential of alterations as a result of the expansion of quagga mussel and the reliance of the fishery on benthic resources, future investigation of basin specific, benthic processes is recommended.

Comparison of Extrapolation and Interpolation Methods for Estimating Daily Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)	GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which are indispensable for simulating plant growth and productivity, are generally very scarce. This study aimed to compare two extrapolation and one interpolation methods for estimating daily PAR reaching the earth surface within the Poyang Lake national nature reserve, China. The daily global solar radiation records at Nanchang meteorological station and daily sunshine duration measurements at nine meteorological stations around Poyang Lake were obtained to achieve the objective. Two extrapolation methods of PARs using recorded and estimated global solar radiation at Nanchang station and three stations (Yongxiu, Xingzi and Duchang) near the nature reserve were carried out, respectively, and a spatial interpolation method combining triangulated irregular network (TIN) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) was implemented to estimate daily PAR. The performance evaluation of the three methods using the PARs measured at Dahuchi Conservation Station (day number of measurement = 105 days) revealed that: (1) the spatial interpolation method achieved the best PAR estimation (R2 = 0.89, s. e. = 0.99, F = 830.02, P < 0.001); (2) the extrapolation method from Nanchang station obtained an unbiased result (R2 = 0.88, s. e. = 0.99, F = 745.29, P < 0.001); however, (3) the extrapolation methods from Yongxiu, Xingzi and Duchang stations were not suitable for this specific site for their biased estimations. Considering the assumptions and principles supporting the extrapolation and interpolation methods, the authors conclude that the spatial interpolation method produces more reliable results than the extrapolation methods and holds the greatest potential in all tested methods, and more PAR measurements should be recorded to evaluate the seasonal, yearly and spatial stabilities of these models for their application to the whole nature reserve of Poyang Lake.					邬国锋/B-8735-2018; Skidmore, Andrew/C-7441-2011; Chen, Lili/HJY-7871-2023	Prins, Herbert/0000-0003-1131-5107; de Leeuw, Jan/0000-0001-7020-2503; Liu, Yaolin/0000-0002-4619-5099; Skidmore, Andrew/0000-0002-7446-8429													1009-5020	1993-5153					2010	13	4					235	242		10.1007/s11806-010-0372-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11806-010-0372-0													WOS:000410095700001

The frequency distribution of the plates, which was slightly skewed to the right and leptokurtic, varied spatially and seasonally. Cyclical frequency changes in plates were most pronounced on sub-adult size classes and these closely tracked (multiple r = 0.77) seasonal differences in the relative proportion of the two major predator groups, trout and diving birds. Trout predation was correlated with an increase in plate number while bird predation was correlated with a reduction in plate number. Such divergent selection pressures, which are probably common in natural populations, would account for the presence of multiple phenotypes and allow for rapid shifts in defensive morphology among different populations where predation regime differs.																			0005-7959	1568-539X				NOV	1995	132		13-14				1079	1094		10.1163/156853995X00469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853995X00469													WOS:A1995TN72500012

Summaries of population growth, age-specific fertility and mortality rates, first-year survival, and seasonality of reproduction are presented, as well as an analysis of survival by decade. In addition, we present data on interbirth intervals in this population. In general, pigtailed macaques represent a typical Old World monkey pattern of age-specific fertility and mortality, with a few minor exceptions. We suggest that pigtailed macaques are most similar to rhesus and Barbary macaques, and that Japanese and bonnet macaques differ somewhat in their demographics. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

M. wesenbergii dominated from the middle of July to the middle of September, and then, M. aeruginosa dominated subsequently. Cell density of M. wesenbergii was high when water temperature was higher than 28 degrees C, and total dissolved nitrogen: total dissolved phosphorus (TDN:TDP) ratio was below 7 (by weight), but low temperature (lower than 23 degrees C) was favorable to high cell density of M. aeruginosa. Cell density of M. wesenbergii was low when concentration of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) was lower than 0.05 mg L-1 and iron concentration was below 0.4 mg L-1; however, cell density of M. aeruginosa was high under these conditions. Our results suggested that temperature and nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) ratio did not affect the succession of M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa. Environmental factors did not explain all of the variation (less than 50 %) and suggested that colonial morphological changes induced by mucilage solubilization should be considered.					xiao, man/N-2972-2014; Li, Ming/JPA-5759-2023; Xiao, Man/N-2972-2014	Xiao, Man/0000-0003-0021-2129													1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2016	75	8							675	10.1007/s12665-016-5511-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5511-y													WOS:000375063400046

Modeling the Influence of Parr Predation by Walleyes and Brown Trout on the Long-Term Population Dynamics of Chinook Salmon in Lake Michigan: A Stage Matrix Approach	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Predation events during ontogeny may have long-term consequences for fish population abundance and variability. We used a stage-based matrix model to evaluate Walleye Sander vitreus and Brown Trout Salmo trutta predation on Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha parr of the Muskegon River stock and the relative influence of parr predation on the long-term population dynamics and recruitment of Chinook Salmon in Lake Michigan. The model predicted the number of Chinook Salmon individuals in each stage (fry, smolts, and lake age 0 [recruits] through lake age 4) and forecasted population trajectories based on demographic data (e.g., survival, growth, and fecundity). The relative influence of parr predation was compared with influences of environmental stochasticity in the egg stage and Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus abundance (prey for lake-stage salmon) on Chinook Salmon fecundity, recruitment, and population growth. To simulate environmental stochasticity and the influence of Alewife abundance, we varied Chinook Salmon stage-specific survival rates, growth rates, maturity schedule, and carrying capacity. Relative to a baseline recruitment scenario, removal of stocked Brown Trout resulted in a significant increase in parr survival and long-term Chinook Salmon abundance. Walleye predation on parr had little apparent influence on Chinook Salmon population dynamics. Predation on parr during out-migration was positively correlated with variation in Chinook Salmon population stability and was negatively correlated with population growth, suggesting that Brown Trout have a significant negative effect on Chinook Salmon recruitment and long-term population stability. The negative effects of variation in egg survival rates and Alewife abundance on Chinook Salmon recruitment and population growth rates were similar to the negative effects from parr predation scenarios. Our study suggests that management decisions to promote Great Lakes Chinook Salmon populations may require evaluation of trout stocking practices in nursery habitats.

This paper investigated four estrogens (estrone, E1; 17 beta-estradiol, E2; estriol, E3; 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, EE2) and three anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in Baiyangdian Lake during the dry (April) and wet seasons (September). These compounds were mostly detected at low levels (ng/L). The occurrence and spatial distribution of these compounds varied noticeably with the sampling seasons, particularly anti-inflammatories which were present in levels 1-2 orders of magnitude larger in the wet season than in the dry season. The concentrations of these compounds at sampling points S1, S4 and S9 (adjacent to the Fu River), S2 and S8 (affected by human activities) and S3 (receiving the input of more upstream pollutants) were higher than at other sampling points. The overall aquatic environment of Baiyangdian Lake was not at the "high risk" level, but at sites S1, S2 and S3 they were at the "medium risk" level mainly due to the mixture effect of estrogens. At site S2 the hazard quotient (HQ) reached a maximum value of 0.903. This HQ of almost 1 indicates that these estrogens pose a potential environmental risk of induced feminization of male aquatic organisms in Baiyangdian Lake.

Niloshini; Reist, James D.; Power, Michael			Identification of the maternal source of young-of-the-year Arctic charr in Lake Hazen, Canada	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												A discriminant function analysis model based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values was used to identify offspring of piscivorous large-form and non-piscivorous small-form Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, morphotypes from Lake Hazen, Nunavut, Canada. The ability to distinguish between morphotypes in Lake Hazen was based mainly on the separation of 15N signatures because of adult occupation of significantly different trophic levels. A smaller difference between adult morphotype 13C values, most likely combined with a potential increase in variation among individuals at the egg stage, a faster turnover rate in carbon relative to nitrogen and the size at which fish can be sampled in the open-water season in Lake Hazen, probably contributes to the limited use of 13C in distinguishing between morphotype offspring. Based on young-of-the-year (YOY) origin estimates, the adult morphotypes were estimated to contribute approximately equally to the YOY population; however, the morphotype offspring were differentially distributed among sampled nursery sites. Unequal distribution corresponds with prerequisites suggested for the evolution of trophic specialists within a single population that experiences assortative mating based on trophic specialisation. Differential use of spawning areas and the more or less equal importance of both Lake Hazen forms found in this study, taken alongside previously noted morphological variation and available genetic evidence, suggest that Lake Hazen may be an example of early divergence relative to other Arctic charr populations described in the literature.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2013	58	7					1425	1435		10.1111/fwb.12139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12139													WOS:000319946000011

Due to the Schlieren effect (SE), occasioned by the formation of frontal and rear negative peaks, modified reverse flow injection (rFI) methods were developed for the quantitation. Water samples were collected at 10 sites on and around the Lagoon from 2012 to 2015 and oxidised with acidic potassium persulphate. To eliminate the SE, acid-molybdate reagent was injected into a 36.4 g L(-1)salinity carrier in the P manifold, and N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine reagent (NINE) was injected into a 0.16 g L(-1)salinity carrier in the N manifold. In both manifolds, the reagent-injection volume was 100 mu L. Good turnover rates of 90 h(-1)and 120 h(-1)were attained for N and total-soluble/total P analysis, respectively. The method detection limit for phosphate-P analysis was 53 mu g L(-1)while that of nitrate-N analysis was 0.10 mg L-1. The accuracies were within 7% as the average recoveries of PO43-P and NO3-N were 107% and 95%, respectively, in spiked blanks. At the top layer of the Lagoon water, the range of [NO3-+NO2-]-N was 0.16 to 0.50 mg L(-1)while the soluble reactive P (SRP) was undetectable to 796 mu g L-1. Total N (TN) ranged from 1.69 to 21.0 mg L(-1)and total P (TP) was 0.13 to 3.94 mg L-1. The study showed that the nutrient limitation (N/P) in the Lagos Lagoon was controlled by rainwater runoff owing to the increased delivery of P to it in the wet season. The distribution of nitrate-N species lacked significant, spatial and temporal variation. Also, the increasing concentration of SRP species viewed against the population density of dwellers around the sites hints at anthropogenic influence.					; OLADOSU, NAJEEM/AAC-7969-2020; Akeem, Abayomi/AAY-1750-2021	OLADOSU, NAJEEM/0000-0003-0439-9699; Abayomi, Akeem/0000-0002-3103-9050													0306-7319	1029-0397				DEC 16	2022	102	16					4862	4881		10.1080/03067319.2020.1790540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2020.1790540		JUL 2020											WOS:000550069400001

Samples were collected during four seasons reflecting levels of rainfall and from five sites around the Reservoir. Water and sediment samples were subjected to liquid-liquid separation and ultrasonic extraction, respectively. GC-ECD was used to identify and quantify the pesticide residues.

There were non-significant differences (p> 0.05) in the spatial distribution of OCPs in water and sediments, but significant differences (p< 0.001) in the temporal distribution of the contaminants in water and sediments, with the wet season samples accounting for the highest concentrations. This indicated that the distribution, behaviour and fate of OCPs the the reservoir have close links with meteorological properties beyond their chemical composition.					; Campion, Benjamin/H-7240-2015; Campion, Benjamin Betey/H-7240-2015	Jidauna Buba, Samuel/0000-0002-0406-4832; Campion, Benjamin Betey/0000-0002-7030-9930													1608-5914	1727-9364				OCT 1	2020	45	4					421	430		10.2989/16085914.2019.1707430	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2019.1707430		JUL 2020											WOS:000550148400001

Cost-effective P reduction strategies must be based on reliable treatment techniques beyond basic erosion control and animal waste storage practices. The Lake Champlain Basin Agricultural Watersheds National Monitoring Program (NMP) Project evaluates the effectiveness of low-cost livestock exclusion, streambank protection, and riparian restoration practices in reducing concentrations and loads of diffuse-source pollutants from grazing land at the watershed level. Treatment and control watersheds in northwestern Vermont have been monitored since 1994 according to a paired-watershed design. Monitoring includes continuous stream discharge recording, flow-proportional sampling for total P and other pollutants, and documentation of land use and agricultural management activities. Strong statistical calibration between the control and treatment watersheds has been achieved. Landowner participation in the land treatment program was entirely voluntary and all treatments were 100% cost-shared by the project and cooperators. Installation of riparian fencing, alternative water supplies, protected stream crossings, and streambank bioengineering was completed in 1997 at a cost of less than US$40,000. The paired-watershed design was cc effective in controlling for the influence of extreme variations in precipitation and streamflow over six years of monitoring. Two years of post-treatment data have documented significant reductions in P concentrations and loads from both treated watersheds. Reductions of similar to20% in mean total P concentration and similar to20-50% in mean total P load have been observed, with greater reductions occurring in the watershed receiving more extensive treatment. The effectiveness of riparian zone restoration in P reduction tended to be lower during periods of very high runoff, especially outside the growing season.																			0273-1223						2002	45	9					51	60		10.2166/wst.2002.0203	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2002.0203								12079124					WOS:000176222600007

To establish species composition, richness, density and biomass, 14 localities were sampled in the lakes. A total of eight species belonging to the families Naididae (five species), Tubificidae (two species), and Enchytraeidae (one species) were found. The dominant species, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, contributed with up to 99% in both abundance and biomass. Sediment organic matter is the most important environmental variable explaining the differences in density and biomass. Seasonal (dry and rainy seasons) changes were not significant for density and biomass. Higher density and lower biomass values characterized these lakes in contrast to other tropical and subtropical lakes worldwide. The small size of the dominant species L. hoffmeisteri was recorded in all lakes and explained the low biomass recorded in the area of study. The correlation between L. hoffmeisteri and four other species (Dero (Dero) nivea, D. (D.) digitata, Nais variabilis and Tubifex tubifex) was negative. The naidid species were positively correlated (>0.5) to each other.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Peralta-Soriano, Laura/0000-0002-1853-8234; Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Escobar Briones, Elva/0000-0002-8485-7495													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2002	467	1-3					109	116		10.1023/A:1014913503577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014913503577													WOS:000174759600009

Experimental imposition of low nitrogen (N): phosphorus (P) loading ratios stimulated N-2-fixation. The N:P molar ratio of the internal pool of nutrients oscillates around a mean of 30:1, despite experimental loading ratios that vary from 13:1 to 0. Maintenance of this internal nutrient mass ratio requires preferential regeneration of N through time at all loading rates. Heterocystous, cyanobacteria blooms are most predictable during imposition of a very low external loading N:P ratio and high P loading relative to natural sources. Knowledge of the internal loading N:P ratio and relative contribution of internal and external loadings are required for predicting blooms at intermediate external N:P loading rates. The internal N:P ratio has fluctuated within narrow limits over 25 yr of nearly constant P loading because of adjustments in N-2-fixation, N sedimentation, and denitrification, which have counterbalanced changing experimental N loading regimes.																			0706-652X					OCT	1994	51	10					2254	2266		10.1139/f94-229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-229													WOS:A1994QK02600014
J	SCHULTZELAM, S; BEVERIDGE, TJ				SCHULTZELAM, S; BEVERIDGE, TJ			NUCLEATION OF CELESTITE AND STRONTIANITE ON A CYANOBACTERIAL S-LAYER	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Synechococcus strain GL24 is a unicellular cyanobacterium that was isolated from Fayetteville Green Lake, New York, a meromictic lake which has high Ca2+ and SO42- concentrations. Epicellular mineralization of Synechococcus cells in the lake is the mechanism by which extensive calcitic bioherms (or microbial reefs) have been formed on the lake's shore and a marl sediment has been built on the lake bottom. Previous studies have shown that calcium carbonate (calcite) formation on the Synechococcus surface is dependent upon an alkaline pH, which is produced in the cellular microenvironment by the cells as their activity increases with seasonal warming of the lake water. At the circumneutral pH of bulk lake water, calcium sulfate (gypsum) is formed. In this study, we show that Synechococcus mediates a similar sulfate-to-carbonate transformation when Sr2+ is the major divalent cation present, forming celestite and strontianite. In experimental systems to which equimolar amounts of Ca2+ and Sr2+, Ca2+ or Sr2+ and Mg2+, or all three ions together were added to artificial lake water, Ca2+ and Sr2+ were incorporated equally into mineral formation to form CaSr(CO3)(2). No Mg2+-containing carbonates were formed when either or both of the other two ions were present. Mineral formation takes place on a hexagonally arranged proteinaceous template (an S-layer) which forms the outermost surface of the Synechococcus cell. Our results provide evidence that the S-layer exhibits selectivity with respect to the ions bound and subsequently incorporated into carbonate minerals and that celestite and strontianite, previously thought to be purely evaporitic minerals, can be biogenically formed.																			0099-2240					FEB	1994	60	2					447	453		10.1128/AEM.60.2.447-453.1994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.60.2.447-453.1994								16349174					WOS:A1994MU32200009

The numbers of feeding trips outside the colony site (Lake Grand-Lieu, western France), where only solitary fishing is used by cormorants, and the number of birds fishing on the lake where social fishing predominates were investigated during the breeding season and compared with the fledging period. From the investigation of feeding trip traffic, we identified three major habitats used by cormorants in the vicinity of the colony site (<25 km around the colony site) that accounted for 94.1 of the IN flights and 92.0% of the OUT flights (n = 1745 arrivals and 2404 departures respectively), and notably one area that accounted for 58% of total flights although it is the furthest away. No fundamental change in the relative significance of these feeding grounds for solitary fishing cormorants was found throughout the breeding season, even in a between-years comparison (1996-2001), in contrast to what has often been found elsewhere. Although the peak of foraging activity in the surrounding habitats and also within the lake waters largely coincided with the time when the majority of young had fledged, the index of cormorant numbers (ratio between bird numbers at a given time and that for a baseline date) on the lake remained at a high level until late August compared to movements outside the lake, as a result of regular social fishing (84.9 +/- 4.0% of fishing numbers). From these findings, we discuss factors governing the selection of feeding grounds throughout the breeding season in relation to energy considerations, feeding strategies and food resources.

Seasonal inundation patterns of these isolated lakes can be misestimated in a hydrodynamic model due to the short time of connectivity. The seasonal and annual variability of the Dinder River flow has great impact on what is so called Mayas wetlands, and hence, on the habitats and the ecological status of the Dinder National Park. This variability produces large morphological changes due to sediment transported within the river or from the upper catchment, which affects inflows to Mayas wetlands and floodplain inundation in general. In this paper, we investigated the morphological dimension using a quasi-3D modelling approach to support the management of the valuable Mayas wetlands ecosystems, and in particular, assessment of hydrological and morphological regime of the Dinder River as well as the Musa Maya. Six scenarios were developed and tested. The first three scenarios consider three different hydrologic conditions of average, wet and dry years under the existing system with the constructed connection canal. While the other three scenarios consider the same hydrologic conditions but under the natural system without an artificial connection canal. The modelling helps to understand the effect of human intervention (connection canal) on the Musa Maya. The comparison between the simulated scenarios concludes that the hydrodynamics and sedimentology of the Maya are driven by the two main factors: a) the hydrological variability of Dinder River; and b) deposited sediment plugs in the connection canal.

In this paper, a potential dissolved solids (PtDS) in three czna-Wodawa Lake catchments was determined using extraction and computer software (GIS and AquaChem). Human pressure on water quality was estimated as a difference of the TDS and a catchment hydrogeochemical potential (TPtDS, total potential dissolved solids). TPtDS coefficient included hydrogeological features of the aquifer, soil cover impact on infiltrated water quality, and sediments susceptibility to denudation. The main advantage of the model is a possibility of its employment for every catchment or other areas (e.g. administrative) on both microscale and mesoscale. The highest TPtDS occurred in the catchment, favoured with underground supply, which was located in the vicinity of the Cretaceous mesoregional unit (Chem Hills). The lowest value was observed in the catchment built with organogenic sediments and coarse material. A seasonal constancy of TPtDS values proved a stability of the lake-catchment systems under study.

J	Abdallah, AM; Barton, DR				Abdallah, AM; Barton, DR			Environmental factors controlling the distributions of benthic invertebrates on rocky shores of Lake Malawi, Africa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An airlift was used to collect 170 quantitative samples of benthic macroinvertebrates from the rocky nearshore zone of islands in southern Lake Malawi from August 1998 to Febuary 1999. Total invertebrate densities were very low (< 6,000 ind/M-2), and were dominated by Ostracoda, Hydracarina, and Chironomidae. Most of the insects were lotic forms, including hydropsychid caddisflies, heptageneid mayflies, and dryopoid beetles. Sampling sites differed in degree of exposure to wave-action, substratum texture, depth (1.5 to 5 m), and abundance of fish, and the density and diversity of the benthic fauna varied significantly with each of these factors. Both numbers of taxa and densities of invertebrates were greater at exposed than sheltered sites, and decreased with increasing depth. Gravel substratum harbored more taxa and higher densities of macroinvertebrates than did cobble or bedrock. The only seasonal change observed was a decrease in the abundance of animals during the rainy season at a sheltered site where sediment was deposited from a large river. There was a weak inverse relationship between the densities of fish and larger invertebrates on cobble and bedrock substrata. Bedrock surfaces covered by fish-exclusion cages supported five-fold more invertebrates than open surfaces after 2 months. Overall, the benthic fauna of rocky shores in southern Lake Malawi is a taxonomically rich community similar in composition and diversity to those reported from other Great Lakes worldwide. Continuous, intense fish predation appears to be responsible for low invertebrate densities and probably influences invertebrate species diversity.																			0380-1330						2003	29			2			202	215		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70549-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70549-8													WOS:000221126800016

The endangered shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum inhabits the rivers below the reservoirs and has also occasionally been reported anecdotally in the reservoirs themselves. During 1998-1999, we conducted a study to determine whether shortnose Sturgeon were reproducing in the reservoirs, and if so, to evaluate habitat use and degree of separation from the riverine groups. Fourteen shortnose sturgeon were captured from the reservoirs, and all (even gravid females) appeared qualitatively less robust than riverine fish previously captured below one of the dams. Ten of the fish were implanted with transmitters and tracked at least once per week. Fish tracked in the upper reservoir, Lake Marion, stayed in the upper portion of that lake or in tributary streams flowing into it. We documented seasonal movements among four primary areas of upper Lake Marion and its tributaries. A spawning site on one of the tributaries, the Congaree River, was verified by collection of viable eggs. Genetic analysis demonstrated significant differences between samples from the Santee-Cooper reservoirs and three nearby coastal rivers. Cooper River samples, however, Were not significantly different from reservoir samples, although appreciable differences in haplotype frequencies were observed. The need for a larger sample size was apparent. Although telemetry, spawning, genetic, and observational evidence suggests that the shortnose sturgeon in the reservoirs form a separate population segment, the results are not conclusive because possible downstream movement, especially of juveniles, through the dams has not been investigated.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2003	132	6					1244	1250		10.1577/T02-036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T02-036													WOS:000186618100020

A total of 72 taxa belonging to 3 phyla, 9 classes and 24 families were recorded, with tolerant oligochaetes and chironomids as the dominant taxa. The environmental conditions and macroinvertebrate assemblages were clearly separated at spatial and temporal scales. Assemblage structure showed both significant but larger spatial than seasonal variations, with a clear separation of sites from three regions in an ordination plot. Compared to the temporal scale, more indicator species were retained to be responsible for the regional differences according to the two-way cluster analysis. Different environmental variables were significant for distinguishing macroinvertebrate assemblages among four seasons, and among them, pH was the only variable which was retained in all models. Our study provided useful background information of environmental characteristics and macroinvertebrate communities in a typical water transfer and storage lake before the water transfer of the SNWD. After the operation of SNWD, we envisage inter-basin water transfer (IBWT), which is usually accompanied by water level rise, nutrient pattern change and biota succession, will seriously affect recipient basins. Therefore, we propose several management strategies for SNWD: (1) target and detailed data should be collected on a timely basis; (2) government should prevent water pollution and adopt effective measures to protect the water environment; (3) the environmental assessments and other aspects of IBWT planning should be coordinated; (4) an overall consideration of different basins should be given to achieve a greater range of water resources planning, scheduling, and allocation; and (5) the migration and invasion of species should be of concern during the operation of the project.

Phytoplankton in dryland riverine waterholes: environmental drivers, variability and ecosystem-monitoring potential using different levels of taxonomic resolution and dataset reduction	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Waterholes that remain in the dry season in intermittent dryland rivers are important biotic refugia, but detailed ecological descriptions of these habitats and their plankton are scarce. We aimed to determine spatial and temporal variation in phytoplankton assemblages in a tropical Australian dryland river system, their main environmental determinants and the potential of the phytoplankton for ecosystem monitoring. We sampled nine sites in three rivers over 2 years using standard methods. Water quality and phytoplankton assemblages varied considerably among sites, rivers and seasons, reflecting lithology, hydrology, bathymetry and local catchment influences. Major environmental drivers included conductivity, pH, temperature and species of N and P. We analysed several derived versions of the original dataset by using density and presence-absence data, eliminating rarer species and grouping species into higher taxa. We found substantial consistency among analyses in environmental drivers, identified using distance-based linear modelling, and in variability among systems, identified using nested permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Responsiveness of the algal assemblages to environmental drivers and consistency among analyses, even using subsamples at low taxonomic resolution, suggests potential for ecosystem monitoring and optimising of sample throughput, although variability among systems requires substantial effort to determine the range of reference conditions.					; Pearson, Richard/GQH-2760-2022	Pearson, Richard/0000-0001-6047-031X; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2021	72	2					244	255		10.1071/MF19343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF19343		JUL 2020											WOS:000546119500001

Seasonal Dynamics of the Hypersaline Lake Oiburg (Crimea) as a Model for Studying Climate Change Effects	WATER RESOURCES												The studies of seasonal variations of some hydrochemical water characteristics (salinity, oxygen content, temperature, pH, and Eh) and the state of brine shrimp population in the typical hypersaline Lake Oiburg (Shtormovoe Vil., Crimea) have clearly shown their dependence on weather conditions. Variations have been established in the population size of brine shrimp, their life stages in the lake, as well as the extent of nauplii emergence from crustacean cysts (from 0.5% in March to 11.0% in February). Because of the ancient origin of Crimean hypersaline lakes (they number 45), which have formed 6500-7000 years ago, the processes taking place in them can be used to reconstruct the climatic and evolution events on the Earth in the distant geological epochs. The potential use of the annual dynamics of climatic, hydrochemical, and environmental characteristics of a salt lake in the model is discussed in the context of studying the effects of climate warming, the ensuing trends in the abiotic conditions in the water body, and their effect on biota.

J	Shulski, MD; Seeley, MW				Shulski, MD; Seeley, MW			Application of snowfall and wind statistics to snow transport modeling for snowdrift control in Minnesota	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Models were utilized to determine the snow accumulation season ( SAS) and to quantify windblown snow for the purpose of snowdrift control for locations in Minnesota. The models require mean monthly temperature, snowfall, density of snow, and wind frequency distribution statistics. Temperature and precipitation data were obtained from local cooperative observing sites, and wind data came from Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)/Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) sites in the region. The temperature- based algorithm used to define the SAS reveals a geographic variability in the starting and ending dates of the season, which is determined by latitude and elevation. Mean seasonal snowfall shows a geographic distribution that is affected by topography and proximity to Lake Superior. Mean snowfall density also exhibits variability, with lower-density snow events displaced to higher-latitude positions. Seasonal wind frequencies show a strong bimodal distribution with peaks from the northwest and southeast vector direction, with an exception for locations in close proximity to the Lake Superior shoreline. In addition, for western and south-central Minnesota there is a considerably higher frequency of wind speeds above the mean snow transport threshold of 7 m s(-1). As such, this area is more conducive to higher potential snow transport totals. Snow relocation coefficients in this area are in the range of 0.4 - 0.9, and, according to the empirical models used in this analysis, this range implies that actual snow transport is 40% - 90% of the total potential in south-central and western areas of the state.																			0894-8763					NOV	2004	43	11					1711	1721		10.1175/JAM2140.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAM2140.1													WOS:000225806600012
J	Wolfinbarger, WC				Wolfinbarger, WC			Influences of biotic and abiotic factors on seasonal succession of zooplankton in Hugo Reservoir, Oklahoma, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												I measured water quality variables, primary productivity, biomass of phytoplankton palatable to zooplankton and zooplankton abundance in mesotrophic Hugo Reservoir, Oklahoma (U.S.A.) at weekly to biweekly intervals between March and September, 1996. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to estimate the influence of abiotic factors and resource availability in structuring the zooplankton assemblage over the season. Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to determine spatial and temporal variation in zooplankton abundances and to make comparisons between repeated measures ANOVA and CCA in analyzing the zooplankton assemblage. In addition, I analyzed relationships among cladoceran reproductive parameters (egg ratio, instantaneous birth rate, reproductive ratio and mean brood size) and environmental factors over the season using product moment correlation. Results showed little evidence of bottom-up control of the zooplankton assemblage. CCA and correlations suggested temperature was the most important factor regulating assemblage structure over the season. Several inverse relationships were seen among cladoceran reproductive parameters and temperature. Declines in Holopedium gibberum Zaddach, Bosmina longirostris Muller and Ceriodaphnia lacustris Birge during June corresponded with increases in mean temperature to above 25 degrees C. Increases in birth rates at the time of population declines suggested that population declines were a result of increased mortality rates (likely due to high water temperature or predation). Spatial variation in the zooplankton assemblage coincided with differences in both temperature and turbidity among sites. Lower abundances of Daphnia parvula Fordyce and C. lacustris and a higher abundance of rotifers at the up-reservoir site coincided with higher mean temperature of the water column and higher turbidity than down-reservoir sites. CCA and ANOVA showed similar results for the spatial and temporal variation in the zooplankton assemblage while CCA provided a more clear approach for analyzing the effects of environmental variables on the assemblage.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	1999	400						13	31		10.1023/A:1003738608697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003738608697													WOS:000083171500002

This constitutes the first extensive study of cormorant diet in this region. We found significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in diet among colonies within a lake. Differences in diet among colonies were usually consistent with knowledge of changes in fish behaviour during the cormorant breeding season, differences in the surrounding bathymetry among breeding colonies, and the proximity of colonies to the preferred habitat of prey species. Our results indicate that temporal and spatial variation, as well as the technique for diet determination, are very important factors that must be considered when assessing the effects of double-crested cormorant predation on fisheries.

The chemical composition of settled particles and of surficial sediment was compared in trying to elucidate the role of some relevant processes like mineralization and resuspension of unconsolidated sediment. A very clear increasing tendency in the magnitude of settling fluxes from the down-reservoir to the up-reservoir zone as a consequence of the prevailing wind direction and of water level fluctuations has been found. Vertical gradients in sestonic rates can mainly be explained by the different contribution of resuspension processes that can be ultimately related to the thermal and hydrologic regime. A comparison of the chemical composition of the total settled matter and of the surficial sediment revealed a predominantly inorganic matrix, which reflects the dominating role of inorganic allochthonous material input.					de Vicente, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/H-5318-2015; Escot, Carmelo/ABH-8609-2020; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016	Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/0000-0003-0687-0704; Escot, Carmelo/0000-0002-5589-0579; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/0000-0002-1449-5740													0003-9136					JUN	2005	163	2					241	257		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0241													WOS:000230923700007
J	Smiley, EA; Tessier, AJ				Smiley, EA; Tessier, AJ			Environmental gradients and the horizontal distribution of microcrustaceans in lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The assemblage of suspension-feeding microcrustaceans in lakes changes along a habitat gradient from nearshore to offshore. This gradient of microcrustaceans was explored in relation to differences in macrophytes and the associated changes in water chemistry, food resources and types of predators. 2. Some microcrustacean species were littoral or limnetic specialists, while others changed their distribution along this horizontal habitat gradient on a diel or seasonal basis. Distribution patterns were similar in a lake and a pond which differed in extent of macrophyte habitat. 3. There was a large shift in the composition of sestonic food, indicating heterotrophic seston nearshore and more autotrophic seston offshore. Sit-and-wait predators of microcrustaceans (e.g. Enallagma spp.) dominated nearshore and cruising predators (e.g. Leptodora kindtii Focke) were more common offshore. 4. A reciprocal transplant experiment revealed that littoral specialists could survive equally well when fed littoral or limnetic seston, while limnetic specialists performed poorly when fed littoral seston. Food resources may be important in determining where some microcrustacean species live along this horizontal habitat gradient.																			0046-5070					MAY	1998	39	3					397	409		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00287.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00287.x													WOS:000073798300001

We predicted that there would be isotopic variability among species in the different sampled environments. Samplings were conducted in three lakes from the Baia subsystem and in two lakes from the Parana Subsystem. At each location, some abiotic variables were measured, and zooplankton (3 to 4) and phytoplankton (3) samples were taken. The species sampled did not present significant differences between subsystems; however, they were different among the lakes, with variations of about 10.8 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 5.8 parts per thousand for delta N-15. The isotopic Values found for phytoplankton also did not differ significantly among sampling stations, presenting variations of about 9.3 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 7.4 parts per thousand for delta N-15. These results indicate that the isotopic values of species varied among the lakes, and that they are dependent on isotopic signals from phytoplankton.					; Lansac-Toha, Fábio/I-3556-2016; Benedito, Evanilde/F-2418-2012	Benedito, Evanilde/0000-0002-3494-9949; Lansac-Toha, Fabio/0000-0001-6746-8052													1984-4689					DEC	2009	26	4					725	732		10.1590/S1984-46702009000400017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1984-46702009000400017													WOS:000274763500017

Relationships among nekton assemblage structure and abiotic conditions in three Texas tidal streams	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The objective of this study was to assess the effects of spatially and temporally varying abiotic conditions on the nekton residing in tidally influenced streams and determine the comparability of the assemblage response across the various gears needed to fully characterize the biota. Three tidal streams were sampled seasonally for 2 years for chemical (physiochemical profiles), physical (in-stream and riparian habitat classification), and biological (nekton sampled with bag seines, trawls, and gill nets) components of ecosystem integrity. Multiple sampling stations on each stream encompassed the transitional character of the tidally influenced ecosystem, from the freshwater of the river to the saltwater of the bay. Instead of characterizing the biota with traditional fish-based indexes of biotic integrity, analysis methodologies relying heavily on multivariate ordination techniques were used. This study showed that the temporal and spatial relationships among nekton assemblages and abiotic environmental conditions were quite gear dependent. The greatest degree of difference in indicators of ecosystem health all involved upstream-downstream gradients that appear to be driven by salinity structure. Based on the results of this study, dissolved oxygen concentration does not appear to be a major structuring factor in the physical, chemical, or biological component of ecosystem integrity.																			0167-6369					DEC	2009	159	1-4					15	34		10.1007/s10661-008-0609-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0609-7								19023671					WOS:000271530400002
J	Goslee, SC; Brooks, RP; Cole, CA				Goslee, SC; Brooks, RP; Cole, CA			Plants as indicators of wetland water source	PLANT ECOLOGY												At the local scale, plant species distribution is determined primarily by the environmental characteristics of a site. In a wetland, water chemistry and hydroperiod are two of the most important of these environmental characteristics. Both are functions of water source. In central Pennsylvania, groundwater input tends to be continuous, while surface water may be permanent or seasonal. The chemistry of groundwater and surface water differs since groundwater is influenced by the substrate through which it flows. Because of these differences, and because of their effects on plant species distribution, it is possible to use vegetation as an indicator of the dominant water source of a site. Plots within 28 wetlands in central Pennsylvania were sampled, and the plots were classified by water source. The three hydrologic categories were groundwater, seasonal surface water, and permanent surface water. The core of the study was the analysis of half of the plots to identify species that were associated with a particular water source. Several groups of indicator species were identified. Some species, including Nyssa sylvatica, were strongly associated with the presence of groundwater. Others, such as Symplocarpus foetidus, were strongly associated with the presence of seasonal surface water. Several aquatic species were associated with permanent surface water. The remainder of the plots were used to test the predictive ability of the indicator species identified. The vegetation of a wetland plot predicted its hydrologic category with 72% accuracy. The identification of more indicator species could lead to the development of a useful tool for wetland research and management, since monitoring hydrology is often both expensive and time-consuming.																			1385-0237					AUG	1997	131	2					199	206		10.1023/A:1009731904915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009731904915													WOS:A1997XP33400006

They may create laminated sediments which can be exploited as ecological archives. Contrary to those of meromictic lakes they are seasonal but not annual. After each flooding a detritus layer and a plasmo-condensed layer of bacteria and algae are formed in the water body or film and during the subsequent dessication a third subaeric layer of evaporites is build up. These laminae show a quasi-textile fabric and they can trap and conserve any dust and fine grained material. A high resolution pollendiagram covering the last two millennia as well as geochemical analysis from a southeastern Tunisian sebkha demonstrate the potentials of these ecological archives.

A 1.5-fold increase in the activity of COX, and the increase in the levels of gene expression of both Cox4 and Cox6 nuclear subunits and increased activity of mitochondrial LDH isozymes, which have a low affinity towards lactate, has been shown. The possible role of nuclear and mitochondrial subunits of cytochrome c oxidase in improving the efficiency of the enzyme in molecule biogenesis and further modulation of its activity, as well as regulation of pyruvate formation to maintain the required rate of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria under low temperature were discussed.

Quantitative paleolimnological inference models applied to a high-resolution biostratigraphic study of lake degradation and recovery, Onondaga Lake, New York (USA)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Once considered one of North America's most polluted lakes, today Onondaga Lake, New York, USA has surface-water quality last seen prior to 1900. Paleolimnological inference models based on the remains of diatoms and chironomids in an annually dated sediment core were used to reconstruct quantitatively the post-1700 history of phosphorus, specific conductance, and volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen levels in the lake. Ostracode and sediment chemical analyses contributed to a detailed interpretation of past lake conditions. Thirteen biostratigraphic intervals are described. Discernible aspects of water quality include climate variability, trophic state, duration of bottom water anoxia, abundance of seasonal algal blooms, trends in specific conductance (a proxy for salinity), nineteenth and twentieth century industrial influences, pollution control efforts back to the late nineteenth century, and the timing of biological response to physical changes in the lake. Before 1822, freshwater, oligotrophic to borderline mesotrophic (similar to 10 mu g/l TP) conditions existed in Onondaga Lake and seasonal anoxia occurred in the hypolimnion. After the lowering of its water level in 1822, the lake became mesotrophic (10-20 mu g/l TP). It became eutrophic (>20 mu g/l) at mid-century, but between 1900 and 1919 there were sporadic returns to mesotrophic conditions. Hypereutrophy (>100 mu g/l TP) prevailed from 1944 into the 1980s. Highest TP levels in the lake occurred during the 1950s through 1970s. Hypolimnetic anoxia increased after 1822 and the lake's profundal benthos declined markedly, disappearing entirely early in the twentieth century. The lake became progressively more saline during the mid-nineteenth century, and was brackish (specific conductance >500 mu S/cm) by the late nineteenth century. The highest salinity levels in the lake occurred from 1972 to 1980. Since the 1970s, inferences from paleolimnological analysis of the lake sediments reflect the well documented, steady decline of phosphorus concentration and salinity in Onondaga Lake, although chironomid-based evidence for abatement of deepwater anoxia is still lacking. This study demonstrates that quantitative paleolimnological inference models can be a valuable, complementary addition to lake management mechanistic modeling, as well as a key part of detailed historical water quality assessments.

J	Mukhopadhyay, B; Smith, EH				Mukhopadhyay, B; Smith, EH			Comparison of statistical methods for estimation of nutrient load to surface reservoirs for sparse data set: Application with a modified model for phosphorus availability	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrient budget models for lakes and reservoirs critically respond to the input pollutant loading, yet little consensus exists on how to estimate the load, particularly for the common but challenging case of sparse nutrient concentration measurements and abundant input flow data. A statistical load calculation using cluster (in this case, annual) mean concentration and stratified (monthly) flow was compared to estimates by sample mean and ratio estimator methods for phosphorus loading to Whitney Reservoir in North Central Texas. The results varied considerably for the various estimator methods during the six-year study period with the cluster and stratified mean approach estimating extreme high loading periods not captured by the other methods. The variable loading patterns were then tested in phosphorus budget model simulations for Whitney Reservoir that considered vertical stratification of the water column, water-sediment phosphorus interaction, and seasonal variations in water quality. For independently determined settling,interlayer dispersion, recycling rates, and sediment burial rates estimated for the respective loading calculation, the cluster and stratified mean loading pattern provided a batter statistical fit of phosphorus concentration measurements in the epilimnion than when ratio estimator load calculations were used. The two loading functions described hypolimnion concentration data equally well. The lesson of this exercise is that various methods of load estimation should be examined in order to develop as reliable a management model as possible when only a sparse data set is available for calibration.

J	Gibson, JJ; Reid, R; Spence, C				Gibson, JJ; Reid, R; Spence, C			A six-year isotopic record of lake evaporation at a mine site in the Canadian subarctic: results and validation	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												An isotopic method is applied in conjunction with a water balance method and the Penman combination method to estimate evaporation from a small, high closure (low outflow) lake near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada (62 degrees 03'N 111 degrees 24'W). The study provides baseline hydrological information for assessment of tailings pond design and management at nearby mine sites, and, notably, enables intercomparison of several field-based evaporation methods and a standard climate approach in a subarctic setting. A non-steady isotope mass balance method is applied to estimate evaporation over time intervals ranging from five days to three weeks, based on isotopic surveys of lake water, groundwater, precipitation and atmospheric moisture during the open water periods of 1991 to 1996. Use of a relatively high precision non-steady technique, in contrast to the commonly employed approach assuming steady state, is feasible in the present setting owing to pronounced seasonal evaporative enrichment in lake water (20-30 times analytical uncertainty of delta(18)O), A comparative analysis reveals that the isotopic method is conservative relative to the Penman combination method, but less conservative than standard water balance, although estimates for the open water period are in agreement to within 20% in both cases. Interannual variability in evaporation is revealed to be 30-50% greater than predicted from standard pan-to-lake algorithms, and of the same order of magnitude as the annual snow water equivalent (approximate to 155-175 mm), which has important implications for the design and management of tailings ponds in the area.

Laboratory measurements of kinetics of sulfate reduction found half-saturation constants (20-30 mumol liter-1) and Q10 values (2.6) similar to values reported in the literature. Sulfate reduction under in situ conditions in sediment cores was limited by sulfate and followed similar uptake kinetics as in laboratory experiments. Some variation in kinetic parameters was evident as a function of location in the lake. No seasonal variation was observed in sulfate reduction rates in the lake sediments, and littoral and pelagic sites exhibited similar rates. Rates of sulfate reduction were much higher than fluxes of sulfate calculated from pore-water profiles. Pore-water profiles also indicated little difference in diffusive fluxes among pelagic and littoral sites and among seasons. The discrepancy between diffusive fluxes and sulfate reduction rates is ascribed to high rates of oxidation of reduced sulfur. Nonlinear rates of sulfate reduction and calculated turnover times of sediment sulfide pools support the hypothesis that sulfide oxidation occurs nearly as rapidly as sulfate reduction.

This life includes site preparation, materials purchase, installation, annual maintenance and replacing landscape features that wear out or die. Users provide a variety of site-descriptive information and the model queries an extensive database of landscape data to calculate costs, required inputs, and impacts. We verified model results against observations of water, labor, fertilizer, and fuel use over eight years at three landscapes in the Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan region. We use the model to show tradeoffs in costs and required inputs for a predominately cool-season turfgrass landscape typical for Salt Lake City and other high desert, intermountain western United States cities and potential modifications to that typical landscape. Results highlight strategies water conservation programs can use to encourage property owners to install and adopt water-conserving landscape features and practices. Residential and commercial landscapers, landscape architects, contractors, and property owners can also model current and proposed landscapes and use results to identify a low-cost, low-input landscape that achieves their client's or their own goals and values.

The main objective was to monitor the dissolved fraction of the metals during the seasons and to establish the extent to which chemical parameters influencing metal toxicity were unfavorable during episodes of high total metal concentrations. The average dissolved fractions of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Al were Lower in Rugla (55, 69, 64, and 17%, respectively) compared with Naustebekken (59, 82, 82, and 30%, respectively). This is probably due to sedimentation of metal particles in a small lake located in the path of Naustebekken. Alkalinity and Ca concentrations were generally low during the flood episodes, when the highest metal concentrations occurred. This is unfavorable since these parameters are assumed to counteract toxic effects of metals. On the other hand, the results indicate that toxic stress during metal concentration peaks was moderated by adsorption of dissolved metal species on colloids and/or particles.

This predicted an accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 cm/y. Rates were significantly lower in 1991 growing season, ranging from 1.2 to 4.2 kg m(-2) y(-1). Factors contributing to the high sedimentation included internal autochthonous production of organic matter and resuspension. Low- and high-flow hydrologic conditions had little effect on sedimentation from 1989-90 but sedimentation was higher in the high-flow wetlands in the 1991 growing season. Deposition was a function of hydrologic loading near the water inflows; no differences were evident further downstream in the basins. Deposition rates and organic and phosphorus concentrations of the sediments increased through the growing season in conjunction with higher sediment concentrations in the inflow water. The patchy nature of vegetation density within the experimental wetlands created channelized flow, resulting in spatial variability in sediment deposition.

The study lakes were characterized by high total P (0.15-24.2 mg liter(-1)), total N (3.75-12.35 mg liter(-1)), total Fe (55-2,800 mu g liter(-1)), dissolved organic C (40-195 mg liter(-1)), pH and alkalinity, but comparatively low (usually <100 mu g liter(-1)) dissolved inorganic N. Chlorophyll a (Chi a) concentrations in all but the two least saline lakes were relatively low (20 mu g liter(-1)), up to three orders of magnitude below those predicted by freshwater P-based models. High alkaline phosphatase activities (APA) and rapid (PO4)-P-32 (orthophosphate) uptake indicated that the two least saline lakes were P limited these lakes had seston deficient in P, N, and protein. APA and (PO4)-P-32 uptake were below detection in the more saline lakes (conductivity >3 mS cm(-1)), indicating P sufficiency; seston from these lakes was deficient in N but not protein. Nitrogen-fixing cyanophytes were important only in one of the lakes examined. Nutrient addition bioassays indicated that phytoplankton biomass was not limited exclusively by inorganic N availability, nor by a combination of Mo and N. For water from all but one of the P-sufficient lakes, addition of Fe to bioassays resulted in a remarkable increase in Chi a concentrations. Addition of Fe and Mo had the same effect as that of Fe alone, while the most saline lake appeared to be limited by one or more additional trace elements (but not Mo). Reducing the alkalinity of the bioassay water stimulated growth in the same manner as the Fe additions, suggesting that the bioavailability of the (largely particulate) Fe already present was severely restricted by lake-water alkalinity. Some component of lake-water alkalinity (which increased with conductivity in these lakes) appears to be the key factor limiting Fe bioavailability and restricting phytoplankton standing crops in the higher salinity lakes.																			0024-3590					MAY	1997	42	3					461	472		10.4319/lo.1997.42.3.0461	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.3.0461													WOS:A1997XZ09100006

Unialgal cultures of three species common in the freshwater phytoplankton were used to test limitation of specific growth rate and final yield in defined media of low K+ concentration (range <0.3-6 mumol L-1 or mmol m(-3) ). 2. Growth rate of the diatom Asterionella formosa was independent of K+ concentration above 0.7 mumol L-1 . Final yield was dependent on initial concentration when accompanied by K+ depletion below this concentration, but not by lesser depletion with more residual K+ . Analyses of particulate K in the biomass indicated a mean final cell content of 2.8 mumol K 10(-8) cells, approximately 1.0% of the organic dry weight. 3. Less detailed work with the diatom Diatoma elongatum showed no dependence of growth rate or final yield upon the initial K+ concentration in the range 0.8-3.2 mumol L-1 . The phytoflagellate Plagioselmis nannoplanctica suffered net mortality in the lowest concentration tested, 0.8 mumol L-1 . 4. Comparison with the range of K+ concentration in natural fresh waters, including a depletion induced by an aquatic macrophyte, suggests that K+ is unlikely to limit growth of phytoplankton. Nevertheless, there can be correlation of K+ with lake trophy.																			0046-5070					MAY	2003	48	5					833	840		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01051.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01051.x													WOS:000182183600007

Measured concentrations of the stan of 103 PCB congeners are higher in south basin water, sediment, and biota compared with the north. The trophic positions of the top predators as well as the extent of biomagnification of PCBs per unit trophic level do not differ significantly between the north and the south basins. We therefore conclude that the higher PCB concentrations in the south basin are due primarily to higher PCB loadings via riverine sources to the south rather than food web processes. In contrast, the data from the north basin suggest lower total loadings of which a higher fraction is from atmospheric deposition. We find that rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) are not associated with elevated exposure of contaminants to top predators of the north basin. This surprising result is attributed to their reduced fitness in this relatively shallow and warm system, which may prevent them from feeding at an elevated trophic level compared with other forage fish. Finally, we hypothesize that high nutrient associated DOC in water decreases PCB bioavailability to lower trophic level organisms and hence the entire food web.					; Diamond, Miriam/D-1770-2013	Stern, Gary/0000-0003-2160-0841; 													0380-1330						2006	32	4					712	727		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[712:DOPITF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[712:DOPITF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243172100005

Subsequently the sustainable use of the fish stocks within the reserve became a challenge for management. The fisheries exploit a variety of habitats distributed over about 580 000 ha of wetland. They yield between 5000 and 10 000 t year(-1), equivalent in value to 6.3 million US$, making this one of the most important inland fisheries in Europe. Approximately 15 000 inhabitants within the Delta and a further 160 000 from adjacent regions depend fully or partly on the fishery resource. The fisheries are diverse, consisting of lake, river, marine coastal and anadromous fisheries. Fisheries in the Delta operated under an open access system during the transition from a fully controlled state economy to a market economy. New fishing regulations have been established to minimise the risk of the fisheries collapsing as a result of the open access regime. Core regulations including close seasons and closed areas, minimum mesh sizes and fish lengths, output controls (catch quota), and input regulations (limited access to fishery) were introduced.

One hundred seventy-two taxa classified into 22 functional groups have been identified. With the largest number of species are the codons: J, X1, MP, F, Lo and W1. Re-sults from the applied cluster analysis show that algae are grouped into four clusters. The first one consists of two homogeneous subclusters, one of which includes dominant green algae and the other-the most common cyanoprokaryotes. The second cluster consists of species with different taxonomic and functional attributes that occur throughout the whole period without strict seasonal preferences. Some taxa with large intergroup distances are differentiated into a third cluster. The fourth cluster is also heterogeneous and it consists of different functional groups. The obtained data show that this ecological approach completely tailored to the characteristics and specifics of artificial fishponds would be appropriate in the study of ecology and seasonal changes of dominant algae species.

J	Li, FY; Jiang, X; Cui, CW				Li, Fangyuan; Jiang, Xu; Cui, Chongwei			Thermal structure and response on local climate and hydrological changes in a reservoir with an icebound season	JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Thermal structure plays a significant role in the aquatic ecosystem of reservoirs. In this paper, thermal structure of a large reservoir for water supply in northeast China has been studied. Considering the reservoir has a 150 days icebound period and the ice cover can affect the heat transfer process, we built a revised numerical simulation model based on EFDC to study the temporal and spatial variation of thermal stratification. The absolute mean error (AME) and mean absolute relative error (MARE) between modeled and observed water temperature are 0.40 degrees C and 7.15%, respectively. The results indicate that the validated model can successfully reproduce the temporal and spatial variation of water temperature. The model results indicate that the reservoir has a reverse thermal stratification in icebound season and there are two over-turning events in a year. Six hypothetical scenarios including the extreme change in the air temperature, inflow discharge, and the water level had been built to quantify the influences of changes in climate and hydrology conditions on the thermal structure. This paper provides a simplified method for the simulation of the water temperature in the reservoir with an icebound season, which can provide a reference for other reservoirs.

This study is undertaken to evaluate the present water quality scenario existing in Kolleru lake, which has been affected seriously due to the anthropogenic disturbances since long. Water samples were collected from ten sampling locations within the lake during pre and post-monsoon seasons of 2017-18. A total of 11 water quality parameters were analysed such as pH, temperature, EC, TDS, TSS, total alkalinity, total hardness, dissolved oxygen, salinity, COD and nitrates. Parameters were estimated by using a standard protocol of APHA 2012. The spatial distribution maps of water quality were generated from pre and post monsoon data using Arc GIS software. Spatio-temporal variation of all parameters indicated that the water quality found was unsatisfactory within the Kolleru lake. The present study shows the better water quality in the post-monsoon season. The Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation spatial mapping was also used for water quality mapping to observe the environmental variation for protecting the important freshwater ecosystem-Kolleru lake. The outcome of GIS analysis demonstrated the spatial visualization of the lodging evolution and geographical distribution trends of water quality parameters within the study area.

J	Slugocki, L				Slugocki, Lukasz			VARIABILITY OF MANDIBLE SHAPE IN THE FRESHWATER GLACIAL RELICT EURYTEMORA LACUSTRIS (POPPE, 1887) (COPEPODA, CALANOIDA, TEMORIDAE)	CRUSTACEANA					Eurytemora International Conference	MAY 13-17, 2019	St Petersburg, RUSSIA					The mandibles of copepods are used to classify the feeding modes of certain species, because these appendages have specific shapes. The number, shape, location, and structure of the mandibular teeth are traits that are related to the feeding preferences of copepods. Therefore, the mandibles have been used as parameters in order to determine the role of the corresponding species in the trophic network. In this study, we aimed to determine the morphological variability of the mandible shape in a rare calanoid, Eurytemora lacustris (Poppe, 1887). The size of the mandibles of E. lacustris is closely related to its body size; however, considering the proportions of the width of the mandibles to that body size, young individuals have relatively larger mandibles. Despite the large body size of males, the females are characterized by larger mandibles than those of males. The teeth of males were found to be smaller, because of intensive abrasion. Moreover, the season and habitat affected the size of the mandibles and also the values of the edge index (EI). The food conditions in the studied lakes fluctuated within seasons, which led to changes in the shape of the dental crowns. Using this index (EI), E. lacustris was classified as an omnivorous species; however, the range of calculated values varied considerably. We note that the values of the EI decrease along with maturation, which suggests that with increase in age, the copepod becomes more herbivorous; however, this contradicts the paradigm that copepods become omnivorous during maturation. All those morphological differences, furthermore, indicate the high phenotypic plasticity of the species, which was found to be related to maturity, sex, phenology, and the environmental conditions of the habitat.

All but one species survived as resting cysts on the lake sediments during a major portion of the year. The exception was the phytoplankton-feeding heterotrophic G. helveticum. Cyst dynamics were tightly coupled to the germination and cyst formation events in the dinoflagellate life-histories. The appearance of vegetative cells in the water was reflected by a corresponding decrease in cyst abundance in the sediments. Similarly, cyst formation in the water column was followed by an increase of cysts in the sediments. The size of the inocula, did not seem to have an effect on the final population maxima. It was concluded, that germination and cyst formation should be studied in detail in order to explain the seasonal succession of dinoflagellates.

J	Jellyman, DJ				Jellyman, DJ			Variability in growth rates of freshwater eels (Anguilla, spp.) in New Zealand	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					Meeting of the EIFAC / ICES Working Group on Eel	SEP, 1994	OVIEDO, SPAIN	EIFAC, Working Grp Eel, ICES, Working Grp Eel				Both species of New Zealand freshwater eels (the shortfinned eel Anguilla australis and the longfinned eel A. dieffenbachii) are widespread and abundant, supporting Important commercial and recreational fisheries. This article reviews growth studies from 35 widely distributed sites throughout New Zealand and discusses factors that influence growth rates. Length at given age is characterized by high intra- and inter-population variability; growth rates for eels >30 cm are typically slow (2-3 cm per gear) and linear, with females generally growing faster than males. Water temperature affects the length of the growing season, although growth rates are not correlated with latitude. Other factors suggested as affecting growth rates are eel density, quantity and quality of food, and interactions between both eel species. Although growth of some New Zealand eel populations is the slowest recorded for any species of Anguilla, growth in culture can be rapid, similar to that of other temperate eel species.																			0906-6691					JUN	1997	6	2					108	115		10.1111/j.1600-0633.1997.tb00151.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.1997.tb00151.x													WOS:A1997XL31500006

Our objective was to evaluate hypotheses linking diel vertical movements of fish with light levels. Smelt distributions were also monitored from June through October (1988 and 1990) to evaluate seasonal changes in their behavior. A strong relationship (r(2) = 0.83) between ambient light intensities and the upper fish layer in the water column was observed. Fish depth was also related to the depth of the thermocline during the night and when surface water temperatures were >18 degrees C. The most characteristic feature was the strong avoidance of light levels >0.1 mu W/cm(2). However, we found considerable variation in lower light levels experienced by the whole fish population. The results suggest that existing models of anti-predation behavior relating light and fish depth are consistent, with some limitations, with patterns of diel vertical migration in rainbow smelt.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												It is generally believed that the Earth's rotation has negligible impact on the water circulation in basins which are very narrow or located near the Equator. However, herein evidence is presented of the influence of the Earth's rotation on the hydrodynamics of Lake Tanganyika, which is both very narrow (width/length approximate to 0.08) and located near the Equator. Numerical simulations exhibit small upwellings at the western shores as a result of the thermocline oscillations induced by the southeasterly winds of the dry season. These structures tend to propagate cyclonically around the lake similar to internal Kelvin waves. Numerical experiments in which f is varied concludes that internal Kelvin waves are present in Lake Tanganyika. It is also evidenced from this study that the internal Kelvin waves cannot be anticipated based on classic scaling arguments.

Species composition and dynamics of phytoplankton were typical of highly trophic conditions and were frequently characterized by the dominance of cyanobacteria, Microcystis, Anabaena, Aphanizomenon. Some environmental parameters play an important role in determining the phytoplankton community succession and their size structure, favouring or limiting the growth of the different groups of the phytoplankton. The results indicate that overall nutrient concentrations in Bidighinzu Lake were not limiting the phytoplankton growth in general. on the contrary, concentrations of nutrient were always above the required levels for phytoplankton growth. The results Show that phytoplankton community succession and their seasonal variability of size structure (consequently cell surface area, cell volume and surface area to volume ratio) were mostly influenced by the temperature and nutrients. However, these affecting factors (especially nutrients) on seasonal variability of size structure of common species in Lake Bidighinzu showed difference among the species.					; Luglie, Antonella/M-4321-2015; AKTAN TURAN, Yelda/AAD-1812-2020; Lugliè, Antonella/M-4321-2015	Aktan Turan, Yelda/0000-0001-7920-8979; Luglie, Antonella/0000-0001-6382-4208; 													1303-2712					NOV	2009	9	2					137	144		10.4194/trjfas.2009.0203	http://dx.doi.org/10.4194/trjfas.2009.0203													WOS:000274072200003
J	Henneman, C; Andersen, DE				Henneman, Carlene; Andersen, David E.			Occupancy Models of Nesting-Season Habitat Associations of Red-Shouldered Hawks in Central Minnesota	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus) are a species of special conservation concern in much of the Great Lakes region, and apparent population declines are thought to be primarily due to habitat loss and alteration. To evaluate red-shouldered hawk-habitat associations during the nesting season and at the landscape scale, we conducted repeated call-broadcast surveys in central Minnesota, USA, across 3 landscapes that represented a range of landscape conditions as a result of differing management practices. In 2004, we conducted repeated call-broadcast surveys at 131 locations in 2 study areas, and in 2005, we surveyed 238 locations in 3 study areas. We developed models relating habitat characteristics at 2 spatial scales to red-shouldered hawk occupancy and assessed support for these models in an information-theoretic framework. Overall, a small proportion of nonforest (grass, clear-cut area, forest,5 yr old), and a large proportion of mature deciduous forest (> 40 yr old), had the strongest association with red-shouldered hawk occupancy (proportion of sites occupied) at both spatial scales. The landscape conditions we examined appeared to contain a habitat transition important to red-shouldered hawks. We found, in predominately forest landscapes, the amount of open habitat was most strongly associated with red-shouldered hawk occupancy, but in landscapes that included slightly less mature forest and more extensive open habitats, the extent of mature deciduous forest was most strongly associated with red-shouldered hawk occupancy. Our results suggested that relatively small (< 5 ha) patches of open habitat (clear-cuts) in otherwise forested landscapes did not appear to influence red-shouldered hawk occupancy. Whereas, in an otherwise similar landscape, with smaller amounts of mature deciduous forest and larger (> 15 ha) patches of open habitat, red-shouldered hawk occupancy decreased, suggesting a threshold in landscape composition, based on both the amount of mature forest and open area, is important in managing forest landscapes for red-shouldered hawks. Our results show that during the nesting season, red-shouldered hawks in central Minnesota occupy at similar rates landscapes with different habitat compositions resulting from different management strategies and that management strategies that create small openings may not negatively affect red-shouldered hawk occupancy.

We present a 900-year, decadal-scale reconstruction based on sedimentary diatoms from Lake Abi in Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica. Hydrological change is inferred from diatom ecological preferences in conjunction with an existing regional training set and implies that lake water specific conductivity, depth and nitrogen availability are the key drivers of diatom assemblage change. Lake Abi underwent a series of subtle environmental changes related to these environmental variables, possibly driven by changes in catchment snow melt and the duration of seasonal ice cover. Ordination is used to trace the major patterns of change in the diatom community, with notable shifts identified between 470 and 400 and at approximate to 350 cal a BP (where present=CE 1950). The frequency of environmental variability at Lake Abi is broadly consistent with a record of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation during the last millennium, but contrasts with the apparent climate stability elsewhere in eastern Antarctica. Further research is required to constrain the limnological and ecological responses of lakes in coastal Antarctica to obtain more rigorous palaeoclimate reconstructions from these sites of immense potential.

Between 5600 and 5100 cal yr BP, the environment was waterlogged and dominated by emersed plants (Paq 0.27-0.38). The influence of the Amazon River was low. Terrestrial vs aquatic ratio (T/A, similar to 0.8), CPI values (3-4) and high contents of PTME (0.22-1.54 mu g/g sed) and aromatics (21-53 mu g/g sed) indicated a strong contribution of terrestrial material and anoxic OM deposition conditions. Between 5100 and 5000 cal yr BP more humid conditions due to heavier rainfalls were observed. Early in this period, terrestrial biomarker contents (253 mu g/g sed of aromatics, Paq similar to 0.17) increased due to input of watershed erosion material. This provoked a rapid burial and good preservation of terrestrial OM (CPI 3-4.5). From 5000 cal yr BP a strong sedimentation of carbonate minerals (OI similar to 1600 mg CO2.g(-1)) masked the OM signal and affecting RE parameters. Paq (similar to 0.18), T/A ratio (similar to 0.4) and the decrease of C-31 alpha beta/C-31 beta beta hopanes (1.18) indicate increasing aquatic conditions up to 2700 cal yr BP. CPI ratio (similar to 1.2) and degraded phytoclasts suggest intense degradation during transport to the sedimentation location. The PTMEs results showed that, from 3000 yr cal BP, the Poaceae genera were different from those found at the bottom (middle-Holocene), suggesting a change of vegetation. The last 600 cal yr BP were marked by the seasonal influence of the Amazon River; during periods of low water level, the organic petrography and CPI values (similar to 1.0) evidenced OM degradation and the return of rather drier conditions.

J	Ojala, A; Kankaala, P; Tulonen, T				Ojala, A; Kankaala, P; Tulonen, T			Growth response of Equisetum fluviatile to elevated CO2 and temperature	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												In contrast to crop plants and terrestrial herbaceous plants, aquatic plants have raised only modest interest among scientists working on climate change. However, climate change studies on emergent macrophytes can be justified with their crucial role in the ecosystem functioning of aquatic habitats. Here we present the results of a three-year study on the growth response of Equisetum fluviatile, a prominent littoral species of boreal lakes, to elevated CO2 (doubled to 600-700 ppm) and temperature (increased 2.5-3 degreesC). Our findings reveal that temperature effects on this species were far more distinct than the effects of CO2, and no interactions of temperature and CO2 were observed. Temperature increase had a positive effect on the emergence of shoots and shoot length growth as well as on the maximum length of shoots. Maximum biomass was also positively affected by temperature. The enhancing effects of temperature were carried over to the next growing season. CO2 enrichment also affected the maximum length of shoots, but the effect was negative. In addition, some response to CO2 in fertility was observed, but again the effect of temperature was more obvious. Exposure to CO2 enrichment seemed to have some positive effects on the belowground biomass of E. fluviatile, although this response was not very clear. Thus, we speculate that in the future climate this species will grow faster and the littoral stands will produce more shoot biomass. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

For this reason it is important to assess how common zooplankton species differ in their grazing impacts on planktonic ecosystems. To accomplish this we used single-species treatments with Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, Daphnia rosea, Diaptomus novamexicanus, and Holopedium gibberum in situ in Castle Lake, California. These taxonomically diverse zooplankters differ markedly in feeding modes and typical seasonal population dynamics. We measured the response of nutrient concentrations, bacterioplankton abundance, phytoplankton species composition and biomass, primary production, a grazing index (phaeophytin/chlorophyll a), and microzooplankton to our single-species treatments. The filter-feeding cladocerans Daphnia and Holopedium and the raptorial filter-feeding calanoid copepod Diaptomus showed several effects typical of herbivorous zooplankton. These included increasing dissolved nutrient concentrations, decreasing algal biomass and the abundance of several common algae, increasing a grazing index, increasing the ratio of bacterial to algal biomass, as well as depressing ciliate microzooplankton abundance. The raptorial cyclopoid copepod Diacyclops was apparently exclusively predaceous as it decimated the ciliate and rotifer microzooplankton, but had no notable effect on the other measured parameters relative to zooplankton-free controls. Diacyclops had the greatest effect on the microzooplankton and Daphnia and Diaptomus had the greatest effect on inorganic nutrients and characteristics of the phytoplankton, Holopedium had qualitatively similar but weaker impacts compared to Daphnia and Diaptomus. None of the zooplankton treatments had an effect on bacterioplankton abundance, nor did grazing by any of these zooplankters increase total algal primary production. Our results suggest differences in the grazing effects of common freshwater zooplankton can be pronounced and indicate that both seasonal succession and long-term shifts in the zooplankton community structure should have marked effects on microzooplankton competitors and prey, the phytoplankton, and nutrient cycling.

J	Bestland, EA; Krull, ES				Bestland, EA; Krull, ES			Palaeoenvironments of Early Miocene Kisingiri volcano Proconsul sites:: evidence from carbon isotopes, palaeosols and hydromagmatic deposits	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Early Miocene (c. 18 Ma) hominoid sites (Proconsui) from Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria occur in palaeosols and volcaniclastic strata deposited in a semi-arid, seasonal climate on the flanks of the active, low-relief edifice of the Kisingiri volcano. Palaeosols interbedded with sequences of primary pyroclastic deposits have stable carbon isotope values indicative of C3 vegetation from semi-arid environments. Isotopic values of palaeosol organic matter and pedogenic carbonate from the Rusinga Group have average delta(13)C of - 23.8 +/- 0.8 and - 7.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, respectively, considerably heavier than average C3 vegetation. These isotopic values were most likely caused by reduced photosynthetic fractionation under water-stressed conditions. Prolonged dry seasons and semi-arid precipitation levels for Rusinga Group fossil soils are also supported by the profile depth of calcareous horizons and vertic clay structures. The principal fossil-bearing units of the Rusinga Group (Kiahera and Hiwegi formations) are dominated by sandy strata which are interbedded with palaeosols and have Features indicative of hydromagmatic pyroclastic deposition. Pyroclaslic surge features include very low-angle cross-bedding, low amplitude and long-wavelength dune bedforms, moderate to poorly sorted layers of tuffaceous and pebbly sandstones, and common, isolated cobbles and boulder clasts of Precambrian basement rocks with associated impact sags. These features are interpreted as the deposits of pyroclastic surge dune bedforms and ballistically implaced volcanic ejecta, both produced by powerful hydromagmatic explosions from the Kisingiri volcano. According to this interpretation, the initial stages of this carbonatite-nephelinite volcano had repeated episodes of hydromagmatic eruptions which built a large (15-20km radius), low-relief tuff ring or maar volcano. The palaeosol sequences interbedded with the primary pyroclastic deposits represent periods of volcanic quiescence lasting hundreds to thousands of years. Thus, Proconsul and associated fauna and Bora inhabited a frequently disturbed landscape that experienced repeated catastrophic volcanic deposition in an overall semi-arid seasonal climate.

J	Pole, M				Pole, M			Repeated flood events and fossil forests at Curio Bay (Middle Jurassic), New Zealand	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												During the Middle Jurassic, the regional environment of Curio Bay, southeast South Island, New Zealand, was a fluvial plain marginal to volcanic uplands. Intermittent flashy, poorly-confined flood events buried successive conifer forests. With the termination of each flood, soils developed and vegetation was reestablished. In most cases, this developed into coniferous forest. In approximately 40 m of vertical section, 10 fossil forest horizons can be distinguished, highlighting a type of fluvial architecture which is poorly documented. Flood-basin material is minimal, but a short-Lived floodbasin lake is inferred to have developed within the interval of study. Paleocurrent indicators suggest enclosure of the basin on more than one side. Sedimentation style suggests a relatively dry (less than humid but not arid) climate with seasonal rainfall.

J	McGuffie, K; Henderson-Sellers, A				McGuffie, K; Henderson-Sellers, A			Stable water isotope characterization of human and natural impacts on land-atmosphere exchanges in the Amazon Basin - art. no. D17104	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[ 1] Stable water isotopes have been employed as a means of challenging, validating, and improving numerical models of the Amazon Basin since the 1980s. This paper serves as an exemplar of how characterization of human and natural impacts on surface-atmosphere water exchanges could beneficially exploit stable water isotope data and simulations. Interpretations of Amazonian isotopic data and model simulations are found to be seriously hampered by ( 1) poor simulation of the gross water budget ( e. g., lack of surface water conservation in models); ( 2) considerable model differences in the fate of precipitation (i.e., between reevaporation and runoff); ( 3) wide ranging characterization of natural causes of water isotopic fluctuations ( especially El Nino and La Nina events); ( 4) isotopic land-atmosphere flux sensitivity to the prescription of boundary layer atmospheric water vapor isotopic depletion; and ( 5) significantly different characterization by current land-surface schemes of the partition of evaporation between isotopically fractionating ( from lakes and rivers) and nonfractionating ( transpiration) processes. Despite these obstacles, we find features in the recent isotopic record that might be derived from circulation and land-use changes. ENSO events may cause decreased depletion in the dry season, because of reduced convective precipitation, while increases in upper basin isotope depletions in the wet season may result from relatively less nonfractionating recycling because there are fewer trees. The promise for isotopic fingerprinting of near-surface continental water cycle changes depends upon fixing shortcomings in current atmospheric and land-surface models.

J	RODRIGUEZ, MA; LEWIS, WM				RODRIGUEZ, MA; LEWIS, WM			REGULATION AND STABILITY IN FISH ASSEMBLAGES OF NEOTROPICAL FLOODPLAIN LAKES	OECOLOGIA												Neotropical floodplain lakes provide an excellent opportunity to examine the regulation and stability of fish assemblages. At low water, when lakes are separated, fish are concentrated in the lakes and are presumably subject to strong interspecific interactions that can shape assemblage structure. At high water, when the lakes and river channels become broadly interconnected, ample potential exists for alteration of assemblage struc ture because eggs, larvae, and older fish may undergo spatial reshuffling among waterbodies. Twenty lakes of the Orinoco River floodplain in Venezuela were surveyed in the early and late dry seasons of two consecutive years. Marked differences in assemblage structure among lakes were established in the early dry season. Changes in assemblage structure during the dry season were large and detectable even at the ordinal level; they reflected a strong reduction of visually oriented fish relative to fish with adaptations to low light. Changes were similar in the two years and were apparently due to species-specific differences in mortality, which was high over the dry season. The annual flood is a strong natural fluctuation that greatly modifies assemblage properties during the wet season. Nevertheless, the potential for alteration of assemblage structure by reshuffling was not realized: assemblage properties early and late in the dry season were similar in the two years, indicating a regular and predictable annual cycle of change in assemblage structure. This regularity can be explained by mechanisms of regulation which appear to be linked to piscivory and the optical environment. In contrast with the pre vailing views on neotropical fish assemblages, there seems to be a strong deterministic component to assemblage structure and dynamics in Orinoco floodplain lakes.

J	Teubner, K				Teubner, K			Phytoplankton, pelagic community and nutrients in a deep oligotrophic alpine lake:: ratios as sensitive indicators of the use of P-resources (DRP:DOP:PP and TN:TP:SRSi)	WATER RESEARCH												The different use of P-resources between two sites in the deep oligotrophic Traunsee was studied by seasonal and vertical patterns of phytoplankton and nutrients from 12/1997 to 10/1998. The P-resources were evaluated from the proportion between the P-fractions, the dissolved reactive P (DRP), dissolved non-reactive P (DOP) and particulate organic P (PP) and from the stoichiometry between nutrients, the total N (TN), the total P (TP) and soluble reactive Si (SRSi). Significant differences between an inshore site impacted by industrial tailings (Ebensee Bay, EB) and an open water reference site (Viechtau, VI) were evident from vertical profiles of both the P-accumulation (%PP of TP) evaluated by DRP:DOP:PP and the distribution of phytoplankton assessed by Si-exhaustion (TN:TP:SRSi), but not from the seasonal patterns of phytoplankton composition, S:V ratios of the algal community or surface layer nutrient dynamics. Low TP and the stable stratification from May to September triggered the relative accumulation of epilimnetic P at VI as it was evident from both the higher portion of particulate P within TP (%PP of TP) and from tile shift towards P-enrichment in nutrient stoichiometry of TN:TP:SRSi. The predominance of around 55-52% algal carbon over bacteria at the surface layer to 20 m coincided spatially with the lowest Si content relative to N and P. The disturbances at the impacted site was summarised by: up to 11% less P accumulation by organisms at the surface, no stoichiometric shift towards TP in the epilimnion when compared with deeper layers and a reduction of the trophogenic zone to the top 10 m. Reasons for this disturbance are seen in the unstable stratification, turbidity, higher TP and the metazoan dominated food chain. Both triple ratios, DRP:DOP:PP and TN:TP:SRSi, were sensitive indicators of the use of P-resources by plankton communities, while inorganic dissolved fractions (DIN:DRP:SRSi, DIN dissolved inorganic N) provided only insufficient information on nutrient resources in Traunsee.

J	SCHALLENBERG, M; KALFF, J				SCHALLENBERG, M; KALFF, J			THE ECOLOGY OF SEDIMENT BACTERIA IN LAKES AND COMPARISONS WITH OTHER AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS	ECOLOGY												We have analyzed our own data set as well as a number of previously published ones to examine factors related to the numbers and biomass of sediment bacteria in a variety of ecosystems. We have chosen to express sediment variables either on an areal or per unit sediment volume basis to avoid bias due to the more common standardization to sediment dry mass (also known as gram dry weight). Cross-system comparisons show that the amount of organic matter present and the sediment water content are important to sediment bacterial abundance. The C:N ratio of the sediment organic matter, possibly reflecting organic matter quality, was found to explain variation in bacterial numbers in addition to that explained by organic content. Over a broad range, sediment water content is related to sediment bacterial numbers in a unimodal fashion indicating dilution of sediments by water at high (> 80%) water content sites and dilution by inorganic particles at low (< 50%) water content sites. In lakes, the most important factors explaining sediment bacterial biomass were sediment water content and hydraulic flushing rate, a finding supported by analysis of an independent data set of English lakes. Planktonic chlorophyll a and planktonic bacterial numbers (both reflecting autochthonous organic matter levels) were not significantly related to sediment bacterial biomass. We found that sediments overlain by epilimnetic water had significantly higher bacterial biomass than those overlain by hypolimnetic water. A strong positive relationship between macrobenthos and sediment bacterial biomass was found for lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Calculations of annual bacterial production and P:B ratios necessary to sustain the macrobenthic population, based on the observed bacterial and macrobenthic biomass and temperature at our sites, indicate that the bacterial biomass present is more than sufficient to maintain the macrobenthos. In addition, based on the observed ratios of bacterial to detrital carbon at our sites and on a range of published assimilation efficiencies for macrobenthos grazing on these carbon sources, we calculated that the mean percentage of carbon of bacterial origin assimilatable by macrobenthos at our sites is 53% with a maximum of 79% and a minimum of 12%. Our results suggest a tighter trophic linkage between sediment bacteria and macrobenthos in our lakes than in most marine habitats, as indicated by published studies. From these analyses, the general picture emerges of a decoupling between pelagic and benthic bacterial processes in lakes, the pelagic ones being driven mainly by autochthonous production and the benthic ones by allochthonous inputs.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1993	74	3					919	934		10.2307/1940816	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940816													WOS:A1993KU39900024

Identification of longitudinal and temporal patterns of phosphorus fractionation in river sediments by non-parametric statistics and pattern recognition techniques	DESALINATION					International Conference on New Water Culture of South East European Contries (AQUA 2005)	OCT 21-23, 2006	Athens, GREECE					A combination of non-parametric explanatory procedures and pattern recognition techniques is introduced in this study as an alternative tool to the assessment of sedimentary P fractionation. The complex raw data matrix was treated with a series of parametric and non-parametric techniques such as correlation analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis/principle components analysis, discriminant analysis, multidimensional scaling, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and non-parametric median test. Each of these procedures has been directed towards the identification of specific mechanisms that control P biogeochemistry in the river sediment. Non-parametric tests were proven as a very powerful tool in interpreting temporal variations of the data in a short-term basis as opposed to previous procedures predicting seasonal or annual changes. On the other hand, parametric techniques were not always able to delineate a reduced number of indicator variables responsible for the large variations in sediment quality, necessitating the application of various techniques in order to interpret the intricate mechanisms occurring in the sediment phase. The examined procedures provide the basis for identifying the patterns of sedimentary P associated with seasonal and spatial patterns, pollution sources as well as differentiate between natural and non-natural inputs, presenting an alternative approach for environmental quality assessments.																			0011-9164					JUL 15	2007	213	1-3					311	333		10.1016/j.desal.2006.04.090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2006.04.090													WOS:000248636500039
J	Sandvik, G; Seip, KL; Pleym, H				Sandvik, G; Seip, KL; Pleym, H			An anatomy of interactions among species in a seasonal world	OIKOS												Mathematical models merging biological and predictable seasonal dynamics were used to simulate four types of organism interactions: competition, prey-predation, mutualism and facilitation. By analysing trajectories for biomass in phase portraits (i.e. species 1 biomass plotted against species 2 biomass) graphically and numerically, we found that each of the four interaction types showed characteristic patterns ("fingerprints") in phase space. All the four interaction types could be distinguished, even though their time trajectories were strongly modified by seasonal forces. For each of the interaction types, we were able to identify characteristics of the interaction that most strongly distinguished it from the others. We could also assess the relative effect of species characteristics and seasonality on each of the four interactions. The simulations indicate that prey-predation is strongly influenced by seasonal forces and by the characteristics of the predator and its prey. A system variability index got a high value (SVI) = 0.167 relative to those of the other interaction types (competition 0.01, mutualism 0.007 and facilitation 0.005). The result was obtained by calculating angles between successive vectors linking pairs of samples and the positive x-axis and arranging these as frequency histograms for each of the four quadrants of the phase portrait. In an effort to capture circular motions and other characteristics of the trajectories sampled, angle frequencies were analysed using multivariate statistics (PCA), yielding "characteristic directions" in phase space. We believe that the characteristic patterns identified also will be found in real time series.																			0030-1299					NOV	2002	99	2					260	271		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990206.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990206.x													WOS:000179715200006

A two step-screening process was carried out, i.e., the screening of algae-lysing bacteria and the selection of anti-Microcystis producers from the bacteria. Sources for the isolation of the bacteria were a co-cultivated fluid of a water sample with axenie Microcystis viridis, a water sample collected in a water bloom season, and a water bloom sample. The water bloom sample was the best source for the isolation of the algae-lysing bacteria and such bacteria were shown to exhibit potent activity. Seventeen strains out of 20 isolated algae-lysing bacteria produced anti-Microcystis activities, and one of the principles was the previously reported argimicin A. These results indicate that algae-lysing bacteria in water blooms may be good sources for potent and selective anti-cyanobacterial compounds.																			0021-8820					JUL	2001	54	7					582	587		10.7164/antibiotics.54.582	http://dx.doi.org/10.7164/antibiotics.54.582								11560377					WOS:000170193400007

An algorithm for turbidity estimation was developed and applied to Landsat TM images to monitor the turbid water on the mire surface during the snow-melting season. We used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to produce a turbidity estimation model. The SMA "unmixes" a mixed pixel determining the fractions due to each spectral end member. In this study, we used four end members (1, alder; 3, reed; 3, high-concentration turbid water (485 ppm); 4, low-concentration turbid water(10 ppm) measured in the test site. The WTI was determined by the following equation: WTI = a(max)/(a(max) + a(min)), where a(max) is abundance of high-concentration turbid water and a(min) is abundance of low concentration turbid water. The end-member spectra of alder and reed were measured in the laboratory using specimens collected at the test site. The spectrum of turbid water was measured at the test sites. The relative abundance of each end member was estimated based on this spectral information using SMA. The same formula was applied to Landsat TM images. Then we applied the WTI equation to the end-member images to obtain a WTI map. In the mire wetland region, turbid water spreads under alder trees and reed grasses. Tb verify our turbidity estimation method based on WTI under these conditions, we constructed a small experimental wetland consisting of mixed stands of alder acid reed. WTI was calculated from the mixed spectrum of this "artificial wetland" and the regression curve for the relation between WTI and the actual turbidity was determined (R-2=.91). Finally, this regression equation was used to derive a turbidity map from the WTI image. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Soininen, J; Tallberg, P; Horppila, J				Soininen, J; Tallberg, P; Horppila, J			Phytoplankton community assembly in a large boreal lake - deterministic pathways or chaotic fluctuations?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The concepts of community assembly and succession are closely related, yet their foci differ slightly. Succession describes the trajectory of species replacements during the temporal development of the community, while assembly also allows that a locality can harbour different communities depending on the events in the near past of community development. 2. The aims of this study were (i) to examine the year-to-year variation in phytoplankton community assembly among basins of different trophy and disturbance in the large boreal Lake Hiidenvesi and (ii) to assess community persistence and diversity among basins in relation to prevailing environmental factors. 3. The results showed that the assembly did not follow similar trajectories each year. According to mean similarity analyses, there was a large degree of variability especially among the groups of samples collected in the same months of different years. Similarity between pairs of consecutive samples was highest in a cold year (1998) in all basins. Community assembly was most unpredictable in the basin of highest productivity, perhaps implying that the number of alternative stable states increased towards higher productivity. Our data also showed a strong unimodal relationship between phytoplankton species richness and grazing by cladoceran zooplankton in the basin of highest trophy. 4. This study showed that phytoplankton community assembly exhibited large variability among the years. This implies that different environmental conditions might be the strongest mechanism behind this pattern, given that the degree of community similarity paralleled the year-to-year variation in mean temperature. Unravelling the patterns in community assembly has a number of important implications, especially for the monitoring of ecological impacts based only on snapshots of biological assemblages.

J	Rokneddine, A; Chentoufi, M				Rokneddine, A; Chentoufi, M			Study of salinity and temperature tolerance limits regarding four crustacean species in a temporary salt water swamp (Lake Zima, Morocco)	ANIMAL BIOLOGY												Tolerance boundaries of four crustacean species (Phallocryotus spinosa, Moina salina, A rctodiaptomus salinus and Ctenodaphnia mediterranea) to salinity and temperature were evaluated by studying the species in their natural environment (salted temporary swamp of Lake Zima near Marrakech, Morocco) and in the laboratory. The seasonal density evolution over the year for the four species in their natural environment reveals three phases (youth, maturity and old). The dwell time of each species depends on the environmental factor values as well as on their rate of change. Laboratory study revealed high euryhaline and eurithermal ability for the four species, with a difference in the optimal salinity range from species to species. The ranges are situated between 5 and 25% for C. mediterranea, 15 and 30% for A. salinus, 15 and 60% for M. Salina and 30 and 90% for P. spinosa. Such a range difference, measured under controlled conditions (laboratory), may well explain the variability in the behaviour of the four species in their natural environment. The tolerance range difference from species to species, together with the instability of the environmental conditions of the milieu, seem to be responsible for the quantitative and qualitative changes of the host fauna, which occur within the year and from year to year.																			1570-7555					SEP	2004	54	3					237	253		10.1163/1570756042484719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1570756042484719													WOS:000226602100002

In this study, the intestinal metazoans were examined from a total of 61 Saimaa seals found dead from 1981 to 2001. The helminth fauna was very depauperate. Only one acanthocephalan species, Corynosoma magdaleni, has been able to survive during isolation in the freshwater environment. In addition, only two cestode species were found: Diphyllobothrium ditretum and Schistocephalus sp. However, neither of these larvae developed in the ringed seals. As the newborn pups of Saimaa seals are nursed for about 2 months only one of them was infected by C. magdaleni. At 2-5 months the pups harboured worms; however, the mean intensity did not rise distinctively until the seals were adults. C. magdaleni infection increased with increasing age and the abundances were significantly different between the age groups. There was no correlation between the number of parasites and the adult seal body weight; however, seals weighing 36 kg or more carried the majority of the worms. The distribution of the parasites was aggregated; six seals carried 65% (n=1,182) of all worms (total n=1,809) and 26 seals were uninfected. Variation in the number of worms in individual seals may indicate differences in feeding behaviour and in the diet of seals, and/or variation in the immune status of the seals.																			0932-0113					SEP	2003	91	1					40	45		10.1007/s00436-003-0893-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-003-0893-7								12884015					WOS:000184985000007
J	Smith, RMH; Mason, TR				Smith, RMH; Mason, TR			Sedimentary environments and trace fossils of tertiary oasis deposits in the Central Namib Desert, Namibia	PALAIOS												Dish-shaped lenses of dolomitic limestone commonly occur in, the arenaceous Lower Tertiary and Quaternary eolianites of the Central Namib Desert region. They are interpreted as the deposits of vegetated playa lakes and, as such have been described as "fossil oases." Regional stratigraphic studies have shown that there were two separate wet episodes during which these playa lakes formed. These are the Zebra Pan Carbonates of the Late Eocene-Early Miocene Tsondab Sandstone Formation. and the Khommabes Carbonates in the partially consolidated Late Pliocene-Recent Sossus Sand Formation. In plan view the dolomitic limestone beds have a roughly concentric distribution of lithofacies and trace fossils that reflect the water-table depth and the interaction of the vegetated lake margins with the surrounding dunes. The facies change laterally from outer arenitic dolocrete with branching unlined cylindrical Planolites burrows, some with indistinct meniscae (possibly Rutichnus) and ovoid Termitichnus nest structures to massive carbonate with desiccation, syneresis, and tepee structures containing abundant Taenidium burrows and reed-stem casts. The central facies comprises microlaminated carbonate with stromatolite mounds and algal matted surfaces with no burrowing infauna. The controlling factor over the stratigraphic distribution of paleo-playas is climate. Both intervals are linked to "wet desert" phases when the climate changed from an arid to relatively wet fluvial phase with perennial rivers and seasonal floods, through to semi-arid with a more flashy fluvial discharge, and eventually returning to arid conditions. The spatial distribution of these assemblages is controlled by interdune topography and river-flood discharge in the case of the Zebra Pan-type end-point playas, and the elevation. of groundwater table by bedrock highs in the case of Khommabes-type eases.

J	Russell, M; Rosell-Melé, A				Russell, M; Rosell-Melé, A			Preliminary study of fluxes of major lipid biomarker classes in the water column and sediments of Lake Baikal, Russia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					Joint Assembly of the EGS/AGU/EUG	APR 06-11, 2003	Nice, FRANCE	EGS, AGU, EUG				The application of biomarker climate proxies to lacustrine settings requires a thorough understanding of those processes that give rise to and mediate in the burial and preservation of organic matter in the sediments. This information is to date missing for Lake Baikal in Central Asia. The biogeochemistry of the lake cannot be considered analogous to that in other lacustrine environments given its enormous size, depth, remote location and unique biology. The aim of this paper is to report on the main compound classes in the water column and sediments. As part of an ongoing evaluation of the inputs and fluxes of organic matter in Lake Baikal, we have found that there are significant differences in the inputs and preservation of organic matter between the North and South Basins. Both basins have dominant algal input and a contribution from the terrestrial plants of the lake edges and surrounding environments. However, the concentration of organic material in the sediment traps and sediments of the South Basin is much higher than that of the North Basin. In addition, the South Basin contains much higher proportions of the more labile material than does the North Basin. This is likely due to the South Basin being free of surface ice for a much longer time than the North, and in consequence, primary producers having an overall longer productive season. There is some evidence of microbial activity in the sediment traps and sediments from both the North and South Basins, but it does not appear to be more predominant in one basin than the other. It is probable that the differences in the composition and concentration of biomarkers in sediments between basins is due to the length of and the intensity of the productive season, which is in turn influenced by the climate.

Additionally eels were collected once from a site on the river Naab (Danube system). All eels were searched for both juvenile and adult stages of A. crassus, revealing prevalences of 80 % in eels from the river Rhine and 39 % in eels from the river Naab. The mean intensities were 5.6 and 7.7, respectively. With respect to the prevalence and mean intensity of infection, no significant differences were observed between the different sampling sites in the Rhine system. Neither the prevalence nor the intensity showed significant seasonal patterns. Further, no correlation between the condition factor of the eels and intensity of infection with A. crassus could be found. Of all eels examined, 28 % showed pathological alterations of the swimbladder.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				MAR 5	1998	32	2					137	143		10.3354/dao032137	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao032137								9676253					WOS:000073636300007
J	Suter, W				Suter, W			Roach rules: Shoaling fish are a constant factor in the diet of cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo in Switzerland	ARDEA												The spatial and temporal Variation in the diet of Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo visiting Switzerland in the non-breeding season was studied from 1985-1992, by means of regurgitated pellets and stomach contents. The results, combined with the data of most other dietary studies from Switzerland since 1974, rest on 4810 samples representing 24 122 fish from ten lakes and nine river stretches. Of 31 fish species occurring at the feeding sites, 23 were found in the diet, yet 5-7 accounted for 85-95% by numbers. Roach Rutilus rutilus was found in 58% of all samples and, together with Perch Perca fluviatilis, accounted for 65% by numbers. Diet was habitat-specific, and three main types could be discerned by canonical variate analysis: (1) diet strongly dominated by Roach and Perch, typical for most eutrophic lakes and empounded rivers; (2) diet containing a high percentage of whitefish Coregonus sp. and Tench Tinca tinca, on two lakes with extremely low Roach biomass; (3) diet dominated by Grayling Thymallus thymallus, Trout Salmo trutta or riverine cyprinids, in free-running rivers. Seasonal Variation was found to be small in Roach-dominated diets but strong at some other sites. Prey size ranged from small fry to adult fish of up to 800 g and was on average larger in rivers than in lakes. Small fish (< 12 cm) were mainly taken in lakes and reservoirs. At a landscape scale, the high proportion of Roach in the diet was associated with a preference for eutrophic lakes that support high densities of Roach and Perch. Roach was estimated to provide > 50% of the biomass ingested by Cormorants in Swiss waters. At a local scale, possible preferences were less conclusive, but Roach was apparently still overrepresented compared to abundance while whitefish was underrepresented. Roach and Perch are both shoaling species and are hunted by Cormorants which themselves congregate in large flocks. A similar preference for highly gregarious fish is apparent in most other studies from continental European inland sites.																			0373-2266						1997	85	1					9	27																WOS:A1997XZ41200002

The same features during both the flood and drought years include that, (a) the primary LF water vapour sources are the south side of Lake Baikal, the northern Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, the South China Sea and the western Pacific Ocean. (b)The key LF water vapour circulation systems are the Lake Baikal anticyclone (LBAC), the Northeast China cyclone (NECC), the Philippine Sea anticyclone (PSAC) and the South China cyclone (SCC). The different features between the flood and drought years include that, (a) the southern Sea of Japan is another water vapour source and the Australia anticyclone (AAC) is another key LF water vapour circulation system in the flood years. (b) There are two southwest warm water vapour flows and one southeast cross-equatorial water vapour flow in the flood years, while there is only one southwest warm water vapour flow in the drought years. In addition, most of notable predictive signals start appearing at approximately -4 days in both the flood and drought years. However, there is a difference in the time of occurrence of similar predictive signals, and some predictive signals only appear in the flood years.

J	Schaeffer, JS; Diana, JS; Haas, RC				Schaeffer, JS; Diana, JS; Haas, RC			Effects of long-term changes in the benthic community on yellow perch in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Abundance, mortality, age and growth, food habits, and energetics of a yellow perch Perca flavescens population were investigated in eutrophic Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron during May to October, 1986 to 1988, and compared population characteristics with historical data from rimes when eutrophic conditions were less severe. During 1986 to 1988, yellow perch were abundant, but grew slowly and experienced high natural mortality. A size threshold was present at 150 to 180 mm beyond which few individuals survived, and sex ratios became biased toward males. An energetic model suggested that yellow perch were food limited; as they increased in size they spent a greater proportion of the growing season near maintenance ration. Low feeding rates were a consequence of subsistence on small chironomid larvae. Piscivory provided little energetic relief: Historical data suggested that availability of large benthic prey such as nymphs of the burrowing mayfly Hexagenia was important to yellow perch. Yellow perch formerly consumed Hexagenia, but mayflies were extirpated from Saginaw Bay during 1953 to 1965, and never recovered. When Hexagenia was present, yellow perch growth was moderate to fast depending on population size, size thresholds were not present, and yellow perch reached large size and older age despite moderate to high fishing mortality. Decreases in yellow perch growth rates during 1952 to 1955 coincided with extirpation of Hexagenia. Fast growth of yellow perch did occur after Hexagenia became extirpated but only when fishing mortality was high, population size was small, and some large benthic invertebrates remained. Eutrophication of Saginaw Bay appeared to affect yellow perch by changing species composition and reducing size structure of the benthic community.																			0380-1330						2000	26	3					340	351		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70697-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70697-6													WOS:000089557100008

Moreover, the pollution of metals and antibiotics was investigated and assessed. In May 2016, the comprehensive trophic level index ( n-ary sumation TLI) at most sampling sites in Gonghu Bay were hypereutrophic, demonstrating that the eutrophication status in Gonghu Bay is still quite intense. The persistent and ubiquitous occurrence of MCs was observed in the water of Gonghu Bay throughout the monitoring period. Moreover, various metal elements and antibiotic compounds were found in the surface water of Gonghu Bay, in which arsenic (As) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) respectively showed high risks. Overall, the water quality of eastern Gonghu Bay is affected mainly by eutrophication, while the antibiotic pollution level is higher in the southern part of Gonghu Bay. Continuous and long-term monitoring efforts are required to document the tendency of water quality change in Gonghu Bay and other parts of Taihu Lake to improve environmental management works.					; Ding, Jiannan/HIR-2080-2022; Jiang, Hang/KCL-4999-2024; Zhang, shanshan/HLP-6320-2023	Razanajatovo, Mamitiana Roger/0000-0003-0843-3399; 													1080-7039	1549-7860				APR 20	2020	26	4					906	920		10.1080/10807039.2018.1545565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2018.1545565													WOS:000534090000004
J	Akar, B; Sahin, B				Akar, Bulent; Sahin, Bulent			Diversity and ecology of benthic algae in Karagol Lake, Karagol-Sahara National Park (Savsat, Artvin, Turkey)	TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Benthic algal flora of Karagol Lake, its seasonal variation, and the physical and chemical parameters of the water were studied between October 2008 and September 2010. The algal flora consisted of 112 taxa belonging to the divisions Charophyta (41), Chlorophyta (33), Cyanobacteria (18), Euglenozoa (17), Miozoa (2), and Ochrophyta (1). Six desmid taxa found in this research are new records for the freshwater algal flora of Turkey. The qualitative dominance of benthic taxa typical of slightly alkaline and mesotrophic ecosystems was observed. The qualitative and seasonal variations in epipelic taxa analyzed were dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the water. Water quality was analyzed on the basis of benthic taxa, which are bioindicators. The physicochemical properties of the water are suitable for the development of a rich algal flora (especially desmids). According to the benthic algal composition and indicator species, it is estimated that Karagol Lake has mesotrophic lake characteristics. This is the first study of benthic algal flora of Karagol Lake and marks a significant contribution to the knowledge of Karagol-Sahara National Park's aquatic biodiversity.

Responses in root physiological characteristics of Vallisneria natans (Hydrocharitaceae) to increasing nutrient loadings	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												We selected the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara for investigating the effects of nutrient loadings (nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P) in mg.L-1: (1) 0.5, 0.05; (2) 1.0, 0.1; (3) 5.0, 0.5; (4) 10.0, 1.0) on root physiological characteristics using sand culture during the growth season (June to October). Results showed that the best root growth was in macrophytes exposed to moderate nutrient conditions (N-P 2, in 1.0 and 0.10 mg.L-1), and high nutrient loadings induced declines in root growth. Analysis of root antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT)) activities, protein content and cell ultrastructure revealed that the root of V. natans was subject to the stress of senescence during the end of the growth season. Moreover, high nutrient loadings increased oxidative stress in aging roots of V. natans, and made the cell ultrastructure of roots vulnerable to damage during senescence. The results for the changes in CAT activity suggest that CAT can serve as an important component of antioxidant defense mechanism in aging roots of V. natans to protect against nutrient loading induced oxidative injury in the early period.

Taxonomic composition and their relative abundance of the planktonic microcrustaceans community was studied. Natural abundances of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes were measured to indicate energy sources. Cladocerans were the most abundant, with a relative abundance of 60%, followed by the calanoid and cyclopoid copepods with relative abundances of 29% and 11%, respectively. Diaphanosoma spp. was the dominant cladoceran group during all the sampling periods. Cladocerans were also represented by Moina spp., Ceriodaphnia spp. and Daphnia gessneri. Three genera of calanoid copepods were found: Notodiaptomus spp, Rhacodiaptomus spp., and Argyrodiaptomus spp. The genus Mesocyclops spp. was identified among the cyclopoid copepods. Zooplankton delta C-13 values indicated that the aquatic macrophyte zone was distinct, with a mean of -27.31%, which was more enriched than zooplankton in the pelagic and littoral zones, where they had mean delta C-13 values of -33.11 and -34.66%, respectively. Overall, analysis of stable isotopes showed that regardless of the pathways, the initial source of carbon for the zooplankton was phytoplankton, with a minimal participation of heterotrophic bacteria.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020														0366-5232	2357-3759				JAN-JUN	2016	38	1					149	164		10.15446/caldasia.v38n1.57835	http://dx.doi.org/10.15446/caldasia.v38n1.57835													WOS:000384886000009

This study monitored the quality of surface water in the Efteni wetland system in Turkey, which is intertwined with the Melen River. Basic water quality parameters and 26 different trace elements were analysed by standard methods (USEPA method 200.7 and ISO 11885) using inductively coupled plasma in water samples taken from inflows, an internal lake and the outlet of the wetland in different seasons (before, during and after the flowering) in 2011. Trace element concentrations differed between tributaries flowing to and within the wetland. Natural attenuation was observed for health risk elements such as molybdenum, copper, nickel, boron and vanadium in all seasons. Most trace elements were observed at their lowest levels during the flowering period. These results confirm that the Efteni wetland acts as a retention zone and, due to its important location in the River Melen watershed, warrants protection.

Capoeta pestai (Pietschmann, 1933) is commercially important fish species in Turkey. The knowledge of the biology of this species is very scarce. This species has a 'critically endangered' status on the IUCN Red List. The objective of this study was to determine the age and growth rates of C. pestai, and to evaluate whether otolith morphometrics could be used as an age predictor. Material and methods. Fish were collected from a small river entering Lake Egirdir between January and December 2012. Fish samples were obtained from shallow parts of the river (30-40 cm depth) seasonally in a single station by using an electrofishing devise. Results. Annual growth increments were counted on the otoliths of 154 specimens, ranging from 6.2 to 26.8 cm total lengths. Estimated ages ranged from 0+ to 7+ years old. The von Bertalanffy growth curve was fitted to the age/total length data as follows: L-infinity = 47.83 cm (TL), K = 0.081, t(0) = -1.840, for females; L-infinity = 41.25 cm (TL), K = 0.086, t(0) = -1.99 for males; L-infinity = 52.45 cm (TL), K = 0.067, t(0) = -1.84 for all specimens. No significant differences in morphometric measures (length, width, and mass) were found between left and right otoliths (paired t-test, P > 0.05). Otolith length and width showed significant linear relations with the total length while otolith mass represented by power model. Conclusion. This study provides the first information on age, growth and otolith morphometric parameters of C. pestai. In addition, otolith morphometric measurements could possibly be used in future as an age predictor for C. pestai.

Watershed Storage Dynamics in the Upper Blue Nile Basin: The Anjeni Experimental Watershed, Ethiopia	LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS, SOILS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES IN VARIED CLIMATES	Springer Geography											Understanding functions of a watershed is important for implementing appropriate soil and water conservation measures and for planning and development of sustainable water resources use. Watershed storage is a significant part of a catchment water budget and its quantification provides a clue to understand the fundamental catchment hydrological processes. This study is aimed to investigate the dynamics of watershed storage of the Anjeni experimental watershed in the Upper Blue Nile basin for which a long series of rainfall and runoff data is available for this study. A daily water balance equation was used to quantify the watershed storage over the distinct rainy season. On average, 86 % of the annual rainfall occurs during distinct rainy season. The study showed that the watershed storage increases with the increase of cumulative rainfall till the watershed stores its maximum capacity. After this maximum capacity, the watershed storage remains constant, even if rainfall continuous. The Anjeni watershed stores an average of 380 mm of water after a cumulative effective rainfall of 625 mm. Before the maximum storage was reached, about 60 % of the effective rainfall is used to wet up the watershed. Then, the remainder becomes surface runoff and interflow, during which about 40 % of the flow appeared at the outlet.

San Nicolas Formation includes these systems: Fluvial, lacustrine, debries flow and pyroclastic [the latter two are volumetrically negligible]. The first consists of these lithofacies: (1) Gm, Gh, Gp: Channel lag deposits. (2) Gm, Gp, Sp, St: Bars of various types. (3) Sr, Sl, Fl; Floodplain deposits; it bears the Late Miocene Paso del Aguila local fauna and palynoflora, which discloses the presence of pine-oak forest with a well developed understory component, and savanna, as well as a much more humid climate regime then than that prevailing at present.

In this study, water quality was assessed on the basis of 5 parameters (DO, NH4+-N, TN, TP and CODcr) that were monitored monthly at 5 sites (N-1,N-2,N-3,N-4 and N-5) from April, 2014 to March, 2015 of the Nanhai Lake in Baotou, China by water pollution index method and comprehensive water quality identification index method. The twelve monitoring months were divided into wet season (Mar., Aug. and Sep.), normal season (Jan., Feb., Apr., Nov. and Dec.) and dry season (May., Jun. and Jul.). The assessment results determined using the water pollution index method showed that the water quality of all the five monitoring sites were inferior., the main contamination was COD. The comprehensive water quality identification index showed that the water quality of the Nanhai Lake were classes., except for the N2 in wet season and dry season, the N1 in dry season and the N5 in normal season, which were classes inferior.. All the five monitoring sites don't achieving the desired water quality standard. According to the analysis, domestic discharge, industrial activities and developed recreation were major threats to water quality of Nanhai Lake.					wang, xiaoyun/AAN-1288-2020; Yin, Zhen-Yu/M-5479-2017														2261-236X						2016	60								02004	10.1051/matecconf/20166002004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/20166002004													WOS:000392135300011

The mycological investigations conducted in two vegetative seasons (2014-15) identified 44 species (eight aquatic fungi and 36 straminipilous organisms). The largest number of fungus species were found in lakes Lasmiady (23), Szarek (22), and Krzywe (20), and the fewest were detected in Elckie (12), Rajgrodzkie (13), and Drestwo (14). The diversity of the quantitative and qualitative composition of the mycobiota was probably associated with the content of biogenic compounds and organic substances in the water. The elevated levels of these parameters (lakes: Lasmiady, Szarek, and Krzywe) stimulated the growth and development of fungi and straminipilous organisms, whereas very high levels of biogenic compounds and organic matter (Lake Elckie) and their very low content (Lake Drqstwo) had an inhibitory effect. Among the isolated taxa, there were parasites of amphibians and their spawn, and fish and eggs, including Achlya americana, Ac. polyandra, Saprolegnia parasitica, and S. ferax. Some species included pathogens of crayfish and other aquatic crustaceans such as Myzocytium microsporum, M zoophthorum, Aphanomyces astaci, and Ap. daphniae. Some fungi appeared to be potentially pathogenic to humans, like Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicalis. Such species as Achlya klebsiana, Ac. prolifera, Leptolegnia caudata, Nowakowskiella elegans, N. macrospora, Pythium inflatum, and Saprolegnia litoralis were common phytosaprobionts. Statistical analysis of the results was conducted to determine a correlation in the number of the species of fungi and straminipilous organisms with such hydrochemical parameters as the levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and biochemical oxygen demand within a five-day period (BOD5) chemical oxygen demand (COD), calcium carbohydrate, nitrate nitrogen, phosphates, chlorides, dry mass, dissolved substances, and suspension. The differences noted in the species composition of the mycobiota in the lakes studied resulted from, among other things, the physicochemical properties of water. Such parameters as the contents of oxygen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphates, dry residue, dissolved substances, and suspension showed a positive correlation, whereas carbon dioxide, BOD5, COD, calcium carbohydrate, and chlorides correlated negatively with the number of the isolated taxa.

We quantified responses of both the motile, calcified growing cell phase (G1 phase) and the calcite shell forming, non-motile mitotic phase (S, G2 and M phase) of the freshwater phytoflagellate Phacotus lenticularis to changes in depth-specific physicochemical parameters and meteorological parameters over two growing seasons. Growing (GCs) and mitotic cells (MCs) segregated vertically during peak development. GCs accumulated within the thermocline, whereas MCs aggregated in the epilimnion down to 4 m depth, which corresponded to the maximum depth of mixing. GCs and MCs differed in their preference with respect to pH and water temperature, but not to water density. Interestingly, pH and temperature variations in the epilimnion, where MCs aggregate and calcify, explained up to 83% of the variance of GC density at a time lag of one and more days in a daily sampling campaign. Among the meteorological variables we tested, rainfall and air temperature had an additional positive effect on GC density. The results suggest that Phacotus cells migrate upwards prior to loss of motility to layers that reduce sinking but likely enhance calcification rates, which translates into a response of GC density.

The aquatic annelid community in Lake Al-Delmage (Iraq)	BIOLOGIA					13th International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaeta (ISAO)	SEP 07-11, 2015	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Botany & Zoology				Lake Al-Delmage is part of the middle section of a main outfall drain located south of Baghdad (Iraq). This study focuses on the community structure of aquatic annelids and the physico-chemical variables in this lake. Six stations along the lake were chosen for sample collection in the period from January 2013 to January 2014. The results revealed that the lake water is oligohaline, with salinity levels ranging from 1.5 to 14.6 parts per thousand and temperatures ranging from 9 degrees C to 33 degrees C; hydrogen ion concentrations (as pH) ranging between 7 and 9. Water was well aerated with dissolved oxygen concentrations values ranging between 6 and 12 mg L-1, and BOD values ranging between 1.5 and 3 mg L-1. The lake water was considered as very hard, since the total hardness values ranging between 825 and 8466 mg L-1. From samples collected during the study period, 1,885 aquatic annelid specimens were identified. Of these, 58% belonged to the family Aeolosomatidae (Polychaeta); the remaining taxa belonged to subfamilies of the family Naididae (Oligochaeta - Clitellata): subfamily Naidinae (6%), subfamily Tubificinae (36%), and subfamily Rhyacodrilinae, Branchiura sowerbyi (3%). Two species of Acolosomatidae were recognized, Aeolosoma hemprichi and Aeolosoma variegatum. Naidid worms of the subfamily Naidinae included three species, Paranais litoralis, Dero (Aulophorus) furcatus, and Stylaria lacustris. The highest frequency percentage of 23.6% was recorded for P. litoralis. The subfamily Tubificinae was represented by five species - Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, L. profundicola, L. claparedean us, L. udekemianus, and Tubifex tubifex. Limnodrilus claparedeanus was the most abundant species, comprising 53% of the total number of Tubificinae. Seasonal fluctuations showed spatial and temporal variations of species richness. The highest species richness was recorded in the stations near the feeder canal, and temporally during June and October 2013.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				JAN	2016	71	1					58	63		10.1515/biolog-2016-0010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-0010													WOS:000372095600009

Samples of fresh water and Fontinalis antipyretica were taken in all four seasons during the years 2010 and 2012. The water chemistry of the investigated locations was dominated by HVO3- - Ca2+ - Mg2+, seasonally ranged from 2.1 to 6.4 mg L-1 and at one of the reference sites did not exceed 1.3 mg L-1. C-13(DIC) values seasonally ranged from -13.3 to -8.1 parts per thousand and indicated waters dominated by degradation of organic matter and dissolution of carbonates. C-13(plant) values of F. antipyretica seasonally ranged from -45 to -32.9 parts per thousand and of N-15(plant) from -0.2 to 6.5 parts per thousand. The higher N-15 value of 6.5 parts per thousand found in F. antipyretica was related to agricultural activity in the watershed. The content of minor and trace elements in F. antipyretica ranged from 4-38 mu g g(-1) for Ni, 17-105 mu g g(-1) for Zn, 2-28 mu g g(-1) for Pb, 0.26-1.95 mu g g(-1) for Cd, 4-27 mu g g(-1) for Cu, 4-49 mu g g(-1) for Cr, 1-6 mu g g(-1) for As and 0.33-3.24 mu g g(-1) for Se. The most polluted watershed was the Pata stream (agricultural area, cattle farm with the highest concentration of nitrate in water) also with highest values for Ni, Cr, Pb, Zn and As.																			1025-6016	1477-2639					2016	52	3					239	257		10.1080/10256016.2016.1114933	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2016.1114933								26758230					WOS:000379252900007

If there is intensive immature fishing, the population of fish reaching the stage of recruitment will decrease, which in turn results in lower yield and biomass. The present study was conducted to estimate the extent of immature fish harvesting by the commercial fishery of Lake Hawassa. Random samples of 962 Oreochromis niloticus and 672 Clarias gariepinus were taken from the fishermen's catch for two weeks from May 15 to 30, 2011, which was peak spawning season for both fish species. The maturity of the sampled fish was determined by visual examination of developmental stages of gonads based on their size, structure and the space they occupy in the body cavity of fish. Lengths at first sexual maturity of male and female C. gariepinus were55.9cm and 54.8cm, respectively and that of male and female O. niloticus were 20.8cm and 20.3cm, respectively. There was heavy immature fishing of C. gariepinus as high as 77.6% but immature fish harvesting was slight for O. niloticus (23.0%). Thus immature fishing of C. gariepinus should be stopped as soon as possible since only one fifth of the population has the chance to breed and replenish the stock before it is caught. Widening the currently used mesh size from 8cm to 10cm is recommended to avoid immature fishing.					; Workie, Tesfaye/GWU-9591-2022	Muluye, Tesfaye/0000-0002-6983-8608; 													2073-073X						2016	8	1					37	49		10.4314/mejs.v8i1.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/mejs.v8i1.3													WOS:000388662500003

Ingestion rates and grazing impact of the brackwater mussel Brachidontes virgiliae in Lake St Lucia, iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Bivalves feed on a combination of phytoplankton and zooplankton and have the potential to impact considerably the planktonic biomass, especially when they occur in high densities, such as in oyster and mussel beds. The brackwater mussel Brachidontes virgiliae is numerically dominant during wet phases within Africa's largest estuarine lake, St Lucia, in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park on the east coast of South Africa. The ingestion rates and potential grazing impact of this small mussel (maximum shell length = 2.5 cm) were estimated for both the wet and dry seasons using an in situ gut fluorescence technique. Ingestion rates were higher during the wet season (5.78 mu g pigment ind.(-1) d(-1)) than during the dry season (4.44 mu g pigment ind.(-1) d(-1)). This might be explained by the increased water temperature and food availability during the wet season. Because of the patchy distribution of mussel populations, there could be higher localised grazing impact near mussel aggregations. Results showed a potential grazing impact of up to 20 times the available phytoplankton biomass at specific sites. These high grazing impacts have the potential to deplete phytoplankton stocks in the lake, especially during wet phases in the northern reaches, where mussel densities are highest. This needs to be factored into ecological models of Lake St Lucia, because the system might function differently during increased flood events.

Zooplankton species compositions have been investigated in each of thermokarst and polygonal lakes of the areas of study. The diversity of zooplankton species was clearly dominated by representatives of the type of Rotifera. On the other hand, Cladocera and Copepoda species were represented approximately in equal proportions. The abundance of Rotifera was higher in zooplankton communities. The zooplankton abundance was determined by rotifers, the biomass - by Copepods. The main species complex consisted of Kellicottia longispina, Keratella cochlearis, Conochilus unicornis, Eudiaptomus graciloides, Cyclopos genera and juvenile cladocerans. The reservoirs were characterized as clean or moderately polluted and oligosaprobic with deviation in beta-mezosaprobic zone. The communities were dominated by widespread zooplankton species where Holarctic and Palearctic organisms were presented approximately in equal proportions. According to biotopic distribution eurytopic species represent half of all the specific composition, planktonic and littoral species were presented in equal proportions. Zooplankton communities in thermokarst lakes were more similar to themselves than the thermokarst and polygonal waterbodies' zooplankton communities. There was clearly seasonality in dominance of zooplankton species and their association with a type of the water body.

Allometry of early growth in selected and wild sources of white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss	NEW FORESTS												White spruce (Picea glauca) is commonly planted in timberlands of the upper Great Lakes region. Genetically improved seed, sourced from selected genotypes and propagated in seed orchards, is a primary seed source for artificial regeneration. Volume improvements gained by planting selected genotypes of Picea glauca sources range from 9 to 30 %; however, tradeoffs associated with selection for volume are relatively unexplored for allometry and needle traits. Biomass allocation is of particular interest, especially if increased wood production comes at the expense of root allocation. Open-pollinated seedlings from wild and selected genotypes were planted. Sixty seedlings per source were destructively sampled per year after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 growing seasons. Roots, stems, and needles were separated, dried and weighed. Tree height and caliper at root collar were measured, along with specific leaf area. Selected genotypes were allometrically similar to wild sources. Tree heights and biomass allocation were similar between sources during years 2-4. By year 5, selected genotypes averaged 30 % more volume and root mass than wild sources but maintained similar allometric ratios. SLA declined with each year and did not differ between sources. Our results suggest that superior volume growth in selected stock is not the result of alterations in biomass allocation or needle morphology: increases in stem mass were associated with tandem increases in root mass.																			0169-4286	1573-5095				JAN	2016	47	1					131	141		10.1007/s11056-015-9498-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-015-9498-0													WOS:000369255900007

The dynamics of production of autochthonous urea as well as maximal potential net ureolytic activity (net URA V-max) of phyto- and bacterioplakton were studied in mesocosm experiment and verified during the field studies conducted in the Great Mazurian Lake system (GMLS). Analysis of the obtained results revealed that the proteins were the main autochthonous urea precursors. Urea concentration in the studied mesocosms and in GMLS surface waters was positively correlated with flagellate, ciliate and crustacean biomass and, less evidently, with bacterial biomass (BB). In surface waters of GMLS net URA V-max, similarly as urea concentrations, increased with their trophic status. Analysis of correlation of potential ureolytic activity with chlorophyll(a), (Chl(a)) BB and L-leucine aminopeptidase activity (AMP) in lakes of different trophic status suggests that although both groups of planktonic microorganisms participated in urea decomposition processes, in eutrophic ones bacterial decomposition of urea is more evident. In highly eutrophic lakes excess of phosphorus induced higher nitrogen requirement resulting in the increase in protein decomposition rate. Intensified protein degradation resulted faster urea production, which finally induced higher ureolytic activity of planktonic microorganisms. In profundal waters of GMLS potential ureolytic activity was distinctly lower than in surface waters. This was caused by low temperature of hypolymnetic waters, inhibitory effect of hydrogen sulphide and lack of phytoplankton, which is known as a primary urea consumer.					; Kalinowska, Krystyna/S-8299-2018	Kalinowska, Krystyna/0000-0002-5099-5371; Chrost, Ryszard J./0000-0003-4806-0179; Kiersztyn, Bartosz/0000-0002-8762-4873; Siuda, Waldemar/0000-0002-3306-9560													1505-2249						2016	64	4					468	484		10.3161/15052249PJE2016.64.4.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2016.64.4.003													WOS:000392459500003

SLOVENSKY NARODOPIS-SLOVAK ETHNOLOGY												For the rural population in Sweden, fishing in lakes and rivers was of great importance until recently. Many fish species served as food or animal fodder, or were used to make glue and other useful products. But the receding of lakes in the nineteenth century, and the expansion of hydropower and worsening of water pollution in the twentieth, contributed to the decline of inland fisheries. At the same time, marine fish became more competitive on the Swedish food market. In some regions, however, certain freshwater species continued to be caught for household consumption well into the twentieth century. One such species was the smelt (Osrnerus eperlanus), which fifty years ago was still of economic importance. Nowadays, however, smelt is only caught in very low volumes; its role is therefore insignificant. In neighbouring countries, however - such as Estonia, Lithuania, and Russia - it is still being exploited commercially. In Germany, where water quality has improved in rivers and restaurants have shown increasing interest in smelt, a successful revival for the fish as a regional and seasonal food can be seen. Smelt fishing has dimensions which are not only culinary, but social and cultural as well. Traditional ways of food preparation can be transformed into modern haute cuisine. Smelt fishing has the potential to develop commercially in Sweden also.																			1335-1303	1339-9357					2016	64	2					136	157																WOS:000449602400004

Lake Trasimeno is one of the largest Italian lakes, and its economic and environmental importance is very high. The analysis of temperature data (1963-2014) shows that annual temperature is increasing - in accordance with what is known for Central Italy and the Mediterranean area - with a significant gradient of about 0.023 degrees C/year. No significant annual and seasonal rainfall trends were observed over the Lake Trasimeno catchment. The power spectrum analysis of rainfall and lake level fluctuations shows that both periodograms have high statistical confidence levels (>99%) for annual and semi-annual cycles. The annual cycles of the periodogram of lake level fluctuations show a higher statistical confidence level than semi-annual cycles. Some other cycles such as the El-Nino Southern oscillation, North Atlantic oscillation, and solar activity are highlighted, with significance levels lower than that of annual and semi-annual cycles. The standardized precipitation (SPI) and standardized reconnaissance drought indices, at different time scales, show that frequency and duration of extreme and severe droughts have increased in the last 25 years. A significant relationship between 12-month SPI and 12-month standardized lake levels fluctuations was obtained for the 1989-2014 period, indicating that SPI12 can be a useful indicator to represent drought severity for systems such as the Lake Trasimeno by considering lake level fluctuations rather than lake levels.

The causal mechanism for this limited recruitment is unknown, but may be related to a lack of suitable spawning habitat. Patch occupancy models were developed to describe variation in detection probability and habitat selection during spawning season using shoreline electrofishing data. Detection of adult walleye was negatively affected by water temperature, silt substrate, and woody cover. Adult walleye selected sites with cooler water temperatures and greater fetch at Enders Reservoir, and large rock substrate and no cover at Hugh Butler Lake; these characteristics are limited to areas on or near the riprap dams in both reservoirs. Walleye eggs were also only found in these areas. We conclude that patch occupancy modeling provided valuable information when considering habitat improvement projects and propose a management approach for the addition of walleye spawning habitat in irrigation reservoirs.

In addition to the geologic structure of the basin, Eti Silver Mine is a significance source of silver for the basin. In this study, water, sediment and fish samples (Squalius cii (Richardson, 1857); Capoeta tinca (Heckel, 1843); Barbus oligolepis Battalgil, 1941) were collected from 8 stations (1 of them is on the Kinik Stream and 1 of them is on the Dursunbey Stream) from Emet Stream Basin seasonally between November 2010 August 2011 to determine the Ag levels in biotic and abiotic components of Emet Stream Basin. Cluster Analysis was applied to the results to classify the stations according to the contents of silver by using the Past package program and also One Way Anova Test was applied to the results to determine the significant differences of silver accumulations by using the SPSS 17 package program. According to data, silver accumulations in abiotic components of Emet Stream Basin were determined as sediment > water and in biotic components (fish tissues) of Emet Stream were determined as kidney > liver > gill > muscle for S. cii, liver > gill > kidney > muscle for C.tinca and gill > liver > kidney > muscle for B. oligolepis, respectively.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021	tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; 													0030-9923					APR	2013	45	2					521	529																WOS:000319176100030

Spatial and temporal segregation of yellow perch in southern Lake Michigan	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Historically, yellow perch, Perca flavescens Mitchill held great recreational and commercial importance to the Lake Michigan fishery. Unfortunately, fluctuations in lake-wide abundances in the past four decades created inconsistencies in catch. As adults, yellow perch have been commonly observed to swim great distances suggesting there is likely to be partitioning of the population within the lake. The objective was to determine whether population demographics of yellow perch in the Indiana waters of Lake Michigan were consistent with a single population. Seasonal population demographics of yellow perch collected from the Indiana waters of Lake Michigan in 2009, 2011 and 2012 were compared. Catch-per-unit-effort of female yellow perch increased during later sampling periods across years. Similarly, total length of females and males increased 10% throughout the year. The proportion of females increased from 20% at the beginning of the survey period to 95% at the end. A few larval yellow perch were collected. These data suggest that Indiana waters of Lake Michigan are not a primary spawning area, rather these waters serve as a feeding or recovery area for post-spawned yellow perch, particularly females.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				AUG	2020	27	4					389	398		10.1111/fme.12424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12424		APR 2020											WOS:000526832000001
J	Lindeman, PV				Lindeman, PV			Comparative life history of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in two habitats in the inland Pacific Northwest	COPEIA												I conducted a comparative analysis of life-history attributes of two populations of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in the inland Pacific Northwest. A population inhabiting three wastewater lagoons contained proportionately more juveniles than one inhabiting a lake on a wildlife refuge. Average fecundity was significantly higher in the wastewater lagoon population (15.8 vs 13.4 eggs/clutch). Minimum size at the onset of sexual maturity was similar in the two populations for males and females (approximately 90 mm and 160 mm plastron length, respectively). However, turtles grew more rapidly and reached these sizes at younger ages in the wastewater lagoons (two years in males and 6-7 years in females) than in the lake population (three years in males and probably 8-10 years in females). These results contrast with local variation in the timing of maturity described for Trachemys scripta, for which females in populations of fast-growing turtles matured at the same age but at a larger body size with a concomitant increase in clutch size. The difference may be related to a contrast in the two species' clutch size-body size correlation, which is greater for T. scripta than C. picta. Interpopulational differences in fecundity and growth rate may have been related to caloric content and consistent seasonal availability of chironomid larvae and pupae fed upon heavily by the turtles in the waste-water lagoons. Lake turtles fed heavily upon odonate larvae in the early and middle active season, and on amphipods throughout the year. Comparison of the two study populations corroborates earlier reports of enhanced life-history parameters for C. picta in habitats that are nutrient enhanced by anthropogenic activity. Both study populations fit intraspecific patterns of increased clutch size and body size and later maturity for C. picta at more northern latitudes and higher elevations. The highly carnivorous diet of both populations, atypical for this species, may result in the relatively large body sizes and clutch sizes observed.																			0045-8511					FEB 2	1996		1					114	130		10.2307/1446947	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1446947													WOS:A1996TU87000012

In 1995, 745 individuals were captured while migrating to the spawning ground compared to 1148 in 1996. In both years, the sex ratio was not significantly different from 1 : 1 but females were significantly longer than males. The spawning migrations lasted about 48 d and were more nocturnal (between 20:00 and 8:00 h) than diurnal. The migration to the spawning ground began when water temperature decreased to 13degreesC and peaked when water temperature decreased from 11degreesC to 7degreesC. Peaks in migration activity were always preceded by a sudden decrease followed by an increase in temperature. The spawning migration lasted until the third week of October, when water temperature varied between 3degreesC and 8degreesC. Males, especially larger ones, arrived on the spawning ground before females in both years. The length of males migrating to the spawning ground decreased during the spawning season while the females' length showed no pattern. Only 9.7% of the 745 fin-clipped individuals from 1995 returned to the lake outlet to spawn in 1996. The results of this study indicate that lacustrine brook charr show similarities to other anadromous and lake-spawning salmonid populations when migrating to spawning grounds.

Following recent theoretical advances in recreation demand, the participant is first viewed as deciding on the number of site trips to take per season and next, as deciding on how to allocate the trips across substitute sites. Decisions are analyzed by linking the results from a nested logit model to separate count-data models using consumer demand theory and trip-price indexes. Our purposes are twofold. The first is to determine if the inclusion of the respondents' perceived importance of lake attributes in a nested logit model of lake boating improves the allocation of trips to the various lakes in a geographic region. The second is to demonstrate an empirical application of discrete-count modeling and to compare annual trip-counts of lake boating from a discrete-count model with a traditional pooled lakes model.																			0022-2216						1998	30	3					301	318		10.1080/00222216.1998.11949834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222216.1998.11949834													WOS:000076008200001
J	Liggins, GW; Kennelly, SJ				Liggins, GW; Kennelly, SJ			By-catch from prawn trawling in the Clarence River estuary, New South Wales, Australia	FISHERIES RESEARCH												By-catch was surveyed in the commercial prawn trawl fleets of the Clarence River system, the largest estuarine prawn fishery in New South Wales, Australia. The catch was censussed in all tows during replicate fishing trips in each month in the 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92 prawn trawl seasons in the two areas of this fishery: the Clarence River and Lake Woolooweyah. Significant species-specific variabilities in abundances were detected at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Despite comparatively small ratios of by-catch to catch of prawns (annual estimates in each area of between 0.13:1 and 0.45:1), hundreds of thousands of small recreationally and commercially important finfish were caught and discarded by the fleet. The results are discussed in terms of (i) their contrast to common generalisations about by-catch in prawn trawl fisheries, (ii) the accuracy and precision of the methods used to quantify and compare by-catches, (iii) the consequences for conflicts between prawn trawl fisheries and other commercial and recreational fisheries that target by-catch species, and (iv) the various strategies available to fisheries managers to resolve potential conflicts.																			0165-7836					MAR	1996	25	3-4					347	367		10.1016/0165-7836(95)00415-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(95)00415-7													WOS:A1996UC05400011

Samples were taken bimonthly from July to December 2002 at 3 sampling stations (deepest station: Station 1, Brik River: Station 2 and M'Zaz Stama River: Station 3). From our results it is evident that zooplankton exhibit seasonally and spatially heterogeneous distribution. The highest density of zooplankton was recorded in September at a depth of 5 m (10.8 x 10(3) ind.l(-1)). At Station 1 cyclopoid copepods (65% of total abundance) were the most abundant group followed by Cladocera (21% of total abundance). At Station 2 (93% of total abundance) and Station 3 (98% of total abundance) cyclopoid copepods were numerically dominant throughout the study period. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to estimate the influence of abiotic and biotic factors in structuring the zooplankton assemblage. Zooplankton abundance was negatively correlated with turbidity (r= -0.381, P <0.05). The results also suggest that both local (environmental parameters, competition, and predation) and regional (hydrologic connections and dispersal) factors have a significant effect on both species richness and community structure of zooplankton in Kasseb Reservoir. The presence of zooplankton species considered to be indicators of eutrophic status confirmed the high trophic levels of Kasseb Reservoir.						elloumi, jannet/0000-0001-7365-0088													0378-4738	1816-7950				APR	2011	37	2					201	212																WOS:000290092600008

Methods Food surveys were carried out in 11 households at the floodplain area (Ituqui Island), located in the Municipality of Santarem, and in 17 households at the terra firme area (Caxiuana National Forest), located in the Municipalities of Melgaco and Portel. Household food consumption data were collected using the 24-hour food recall method. Data analysis was run in Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 12.0. Results The results confirm, in both ecosystems, the central roles of fish and manioc in the local diet. Nevertheless, other secondary food items, e. g. acai (in Caxiuana) and milk (in Ituqui) are also important. In addition, sugar stands out as a reliable household energy source to cope with the extreme seasonality of rain forest natural resources. In addition, there seems to be a greater caloric contribution of fish in Ituqui's diet, probably due to the higher productivity of lakes and rivers in Ituqui varzea (low and flat land alongside a watercourse). Finally, Ituqui has shown greater dependency over purchased items, whereas Caxiuana has still a strong reliance on agricultural activities and on local social and economic exchange networks. Conclusion Besides confirming the importance of fish and manioc, results have also shown that industrialized products, such as sugar, play an important role in local diets, and may point towards new tendencies in food consumption related to the current nutritional transition and to the erosion of local subsistence systems.

Chronic high-level GC concentration and vigilance occur at the expense of other life maintenance and reproduction activities, reflecting a trade-off between individual survival and future fecundity. Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) is a groupliving ungulate endemic to the high-altitude Qinghai Lake region of China. Group-size effect on gazelle vigilance has been examined, yet little is known about how their GC concentration is affected by group size or reproductive status. In this study, we examined the effect of group size and reproductive status on faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations and individual vigilance during different stages of the reproduction cycle (i.e. non-breeding, lambing and rutting) in free-ranging adult female Przewalski's gazelles. Group size did not influence FGMs significantly, but mean vigilance duration increased with group size. The gazelles' FGMs and vigilance peaked in lambing season. FGMs showed no difference between rutting season and non-reproductive season, but vigilance was lowest in the rutting season. FGMs correlated with vigilance frequency and vigilance duration. Antipredator responses of female Przewalski's gazelles appear to change with reproductive status but not with group size in free-ranging females. Management measures should be taken in the lambing season to minimize stress on mother gazelles.

In the laboratory, Steinernema carpocapsae, S. riobrave, S. feltiae, Heterorhabditis megidis, H. bacteriophora, and a control (water only) were compared in sand and muck soil against adults, and in sand against larvae. All nematode species produced high levels of larval mortality. S. carpocapsae produced significantly greater adult mortality in sand than other species or the untreated control. H. bacteriophora caused low adult mortality in sand, but the greatest adult mortality among treatments in a similar test that used muck soil; S. carpocapsae was ranked second on muck soil. Other species consistently produced intermediate (H. megidis and S. riobrave) or low (S. feltiae) levels of mortality on both substrates. In the field, we compared the effect of early season vs. late season applications of H. bacteriophora or S. carpocapsae on carrot weevil mortality and parsley survival and yield. Significant differences among treatments in plant survival and yield were not found; however treatments involving H. bacteriophora had higher plant survival than other treatments. Earlier application of this species was associated with higher plant survival. S. carpocapsae treatments had similar plant survival to the control. Mortality of larvae and combined stages of carrot weevil was significantly greater at 1 week following H. bacteriophora application than for other treatments. H. bacteriophora also showed greater persistence than S. carpocapsae in treated plots. We conclude that H. bacteriophora is a good candidate for further evaluation as a biological control agent against carrot weevil on muck soils in the Great Lakes region.																			1386-6141					OCT	2002	47	5					545	561		10.1023/A:1016580310153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016580310153													WOS:000177133900006

I:IU histological examinations, the female genital tubules were filled with the atretic oocytes after the spawning season of 1995. Therefore, it was concluded that most C., japonica failed to spawn in 1995. The effects of temperature and salinity on the spawning of C. japonica were examined in a spawning induction experiment under laboratory conditions. Probability of spawning by C. japonica in the experiment was described by the equation: 1/{1 + exp[-(-15.57+0.57T-12.64S-0.55Gam+0.69T.S-0.1T.S.Gam)]} (T: temperature, S: salinity, Gam: dummy variable of 1 or 2, i.e. 1 denotes each group to which the gamete suspension was added and 2 each group to which the gamete suspension was not added). The probability of spawning within the group to which the gamete suspension was added (i.e. Gam = 1) explained well both annual and seasonal fluctuations of larval occurrence in Lake Abashiri in past years. The spawning of C. japonica may have been extremely low in 1995 and 1996 because of low temperature and low salinity. Such unfavorable conditions for spawning are not exceptional and occurred in 10 out of 21 years for which data were available. In C. japonica, reproduction succeeds less frequently in northern than in southern populations because the probability of spawning depends markedly on the temperature.

Histopathology of the liver and gills of Labeo rosae (rednose Labeo) from Loskop Dam in South Africa	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												The Loskop Dam is the most polluted impoundment in the Olifants River, because it receives pollutants from the entire mine-dominated upper catchment. However, histopathology of fish inhabiting this polluted dam is scantly explored. The current study aimed to investigate the histopathology of the gills and liver of Labeo rosae from Loskop Dam. Alkaline pH was observed throughout the study with most metal concentrations exceeding the water quality guideline for aquatic ecosystems. Regressive changes were the most prominent lesions for both organs with gills showing relatively more pathologies than the liver. Epithelial lifting was 100% prevalent during both seasons in the gills whereas a significant expansion of lipofuscin-laden melanomacrophages (MMCs) showed 100% prevalence in the liver. Gills were significantly different in their prevalence of histopathology between the two seasons, which was not the case for liver. The histopathology recorded in this study shows that the health of L. rosae at Loskop Dam was compromised. Given the exacerbating pollution level in the upper Olifants River, these findings serve as a warning to conservation authorities and emphasise the necessity for regular monitoring of fish health at Loskop Dam to assess pollution levels using fish health as a sensitive indicator to altering pollution levels.					; Lebepe, Jeffrey/LMO-3813-2024	Steyl, Johan Christian Abraham/0000-0002-5940-6799; Lebepe, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9802-2846; Luus-Powell, Wilmien/0000-0001-8264-4376													1562-7020	2224-073X				APR 2	2020	55	2					167	174		10.1080/15627020.2020.1740610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2020.1740610													WOS:000538199600007

Presence of arsenic and potentially toxic metals (Cd, Cr, Pb) in water and soil of the NE shore of Chapala Lake, Mexico, and its genotoxic effect in the edible chayote fruit (Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw.)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE												The presence of potentially toxic elements in waters used for agricultural irrigation is a latent problem in Lake Chapala, Mexico. Four sites in the polluted area of Chapala lake were studied in this research. Samples of irrigation water and soil were collected from each site in both the dry (DS) and rainy (RS) seasons. Arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) were measured in all the samples. Comet assay was used to measure the migration of DNA from the nucleus in order to detect genotoxicity in fruits. ISSR molecular markers were used to assess the detection power of this marker in correspondence with amounts of metals in the samples. The results show a variation of metal concentrations in the DS and RS soil and water samples. The metalloid As in DS water samples exceeded the permissible limits in three of the sampling areas. Cd and Pb exceeded the prescribed limits from collected water in three of the sampling areas in RS. Cd exceeded the maximum permissible limits in soil collected during both DS and RS in the four sampling sites. Data on the concentration of metals shows significant differences between the sampling areas and the control site. Genetic damage (DNA migration from the nuclei) was found in the chayote fruit and the major migration of DNA was associated principally with the presence of As in DS water samples as well as Pb in soil in RS.					; Alvarez-Moya, Carlos/I-1383-2019; Torres-Morán, Martha/AAZ-2274-2020	Maldonado Villegas, Marcela Mariel/0000-0002-0483-6951; Torres-Moran, Martha Isabel/0000-0002-0737-0085													1611-4426	1611-4434				APR	2020	85	2					110	117		10.17660/eJHS.2020/85.2.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/eJHS.2020/85.2.5													WOS:000532087000005

Probably, the lake was casually invaded by the species, since it was not specially introduced. By 2002, the Baikalian endemic was registered in all the main lakes of the Ivano-Arakhlei system (lakes Arakhlei, Shakshinskoe, Bjl'shoi Undugun, Irgen, Ivan, and Tasei) and in Lake Kenon (the Amur River basin). Nowadays, this species is the dominant one in many zoobenthos communities of Lake Aralchlei. The basic biotopes, which are inhabited by this species in the lake, and seasonal dynamics of its number and biomass were determined. The life duration of cohorts was assessed. The role of the species in trophic chains of the lake ecosystem was shown. The recent data on natural and artificial G. fasciatus areas were summarized.

The ions showing the highest variability in results were (in decreasing order) NH4+, H+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-, Na+, NO3-, and SO42-, based on the median coefficient of variation of deposition. The variability observed was related to the reactivity of the ion in the canopy, with the more reactive ions showing higher spatial variability. The number of collectors required to obtain estimates of throughfall ion depositions within a 10% error and a confidence interval of 95% varied from 21 (SO42-) to 165 (NH4+) on a weekly basis based on events of median variability. The error associated with deposition measurements was decreased considerably from weekly, to monthly, to seasonal deposition (3 months). The number of collectors necessary to measure throughfall deposition depends on the data quality objectives of the study (i.e., error and confidence interval chosen as acceptable), the variability specific to a given ion, and the time period needed to study a given process with adequate temporal resolution. A figure is proposed that may be used as a guideline to determine the number of collectors needed in mixed hardwood forests based on the latter information.

The phytoplankton of the large shallow Lake Balaton was studied quantitatively on 211 consecutive days between April and November 1980. In total 417 taxa were found during the period of sampling. The number of planktonic species was c. 300. Compared with the few dominants, most of the species were extremely rare. 2. Relative frequencies (RF) within the total number of enumerated specimens (c. 100000) were used to analyse the quantities of both frequent and rare species on a common quantitative base. Approximately two-thirds of the 300 planktonic species were evenly distributed in time, the others exhibited temporal peaks. Based on population dynamics, 100 species (RF > 2000(-1), i.e. a relative frequency greater than 500 out of 100000 specimens) are considered to characterize the community responses to changes in both major and minor resources set by the given pattern of environmental background. Approximately 15 of these 100 species might have had an allochthonous origin. 3. Approximately half of the 200 rare species are velocity specialists, able to grow rapidly in spatially and temporally randomly distributed, nutrient-rich micro-environments; the other 100 are termed the 'ecological memory' of the phytoplankton community. Memory is considered here to be the capacity of past states or experiences to influence present or future responses of the community. 4. The memory of the community comprises all the potential recruit-species which are not completely excluded because of spatial and temporal disturbances (heterogeneity). These species may out-compete the regular dominants of the most probable seasonal successional pattern if the competitive arena changes. 5. Several cases (years with exceptional meteorological conditions, limnocorral experiments) in the history of planktonic events in Lake Balaton and in other lakes support the hypothesis.

WATERSHED-SCALE CROP TYPE CLASSIFICATION USING SEASONAL TRENDS IN REMOTE SENSING-DERIVED VEGETATION INDICES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Analysis and simulation of watershed-scale processes requires spatial characterization of land use, including differentiation among crop types. If this crop type information could be obtained accurately from remote sensing data, the effort required would be significantly reduced, especially for large watersheds. The objective of this study was to compare two methods using multiple satellite remote sensing datasets to differentiate land cover, including crop type, for the Salt River/Mark Twain Lake basin in northeast Missouri. Method I involved unsupervised classification of Landsat visible and near-infrared satellite images obtained at multiple dates in the growing season, followed by traditional, manual class identification. Method 2, developed in this research, employed the same unsupervised classification but also used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps obtained on a 16-day cycle from MODIS satellite images as ancillary data to derive seasonal NDVI trends for each class in the classification map. Tree analysis was applied to the NDVI trend data to group similar classes into clusters, and crop type for each cluster was determined from ground-truth data. Additional ground-truth data were used to assess the accuracy of the procedure, and crop acreage estimates were compared to county-level statistics. The overall classification accuracy of Method 2 was 3% higher than that of Method 1. Method 2 was also more efficient in terms of analyst time and ground-truth data requirements. Therefore, this method, employing variations in seasonal NDVI trends, is suggested for differentiation of crop type. The 30-m resolution crop type maps developed using this process will be useful as input data to environmental analysis models.

J	Lemma, B				Lemma, Brook			Observations on the relations of some physico-chemical features and DVM of Paradiaptomus africanus in Lakes Bishoftu-Guda and Hora-Arsedi, Bishoftu, Ethiopia	LIMNOLOGICA												Bishoftu-Guda and Hora-Arsedi are two crater lakes found in close proximity with each other in a locality known as Bishoftu, 50 km south of Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia. The main objective of this study was to measure some physico-chemical features and discuss their relations with the dial vertical migration (DVM) behavior of Paradiaptomus africanus, the dominant macrozooplankton in both lakes. By depth measurements of dissolved oxygen and temperature showed that there is persistent stratification in these lakes. Secchi depth was shallow and the water chemistry as shown from conductivity and chemical analysis were comparable between the two lakes. These data were compared with previous reports to bring out the overall limnological scenario of the two lakes. Then, the relations of these data to the DVM of P. africanus in both lakes were discussed. It was found out that DVM of P. africanus occurred in Lakes Bishoftu-Guda and Hora-Arsedi mostly within a range of about 3 m very likely for two reasons, namely avoidance of solar radiation and ultimately vertebrate visual predation. However, the depth of DVM of P. africanus was found to be very shallow probably due to high water turbidity that provided this calanoid sufficient refuge by daylight from both dangers, while at the same time P. africanus remained in warm and oxygen-rich waters. Temperature was not much of a factor affecting DVM as it remained above 19 degrees C at all depths. As this study was conducted over limited time frames, seasonal studies regarding changes in physico-chemical parameters, plankton, vertebrate predators and human interference were recommended so that the information so gathered could be used in the management of the study lakes.

These fish were harvested from 211 water bodies. Anglers harvested fifty-six percent of the trophy fish during January through March. Peak months for trophy harvest were progressively later in the year from south to north Florida and coincided with the largemouth bass spawning season in each region. Mean age of trophy largemouth bass statewide was 10 years and ranged from four to 16 years. There was a significant negative relationship with trophy largemouth bass growth and latitude and a significant positive relationship between lake productivity and total alkalinity with growth. Accelerated growth, longevity and strong year classes of largemouth bass were important for trophy largemouth bass production in Florida. Availability of lake chubsuckers Erimyzon succeta, low abundance of competitive predators and reduced vulnerability from anglers were important parameters in Lake Pasadena, a lake that had high tropthy production (one trophy fish/10 ha). High biomass of available prey, low abundance of competitive predators and periodically low levels of angling effort were important in producing trophy fish with fast growth in Lake Thonotosassa.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						567	581																WOS:000180817600047

Rates of sedimentation and of contact with benthic filter-feeders should decline with rising water level. Therefore, discharge-dependent water depth should predispose the fate of phytoplankton transported down a river. Growth and loss of phytoplankton have been studied at different discharge levels along the lowland rivers Spree and Warnow. The mean depth of the river courses ranged from 0.3 to 3 m, the mean velocity of flow from 0.05 to 0.5 m s(-1). We compared changes in phytoplankton biomass in a water parcel flowing downstream with those in simultaneously incubated dialysis chambers. The difference between rates of biomass change along the river and in the vertical moved chambers was used as an estimate of loss rates by sedimentation and grazing by benthic filter-feeders. Caged centric diatoms realized maximum growth rates at daily light exposures of 6 to 15 E m(-2). Growth of chlorophytes was light-saturated above 15 E m(-2) d(-1). Observing the seasonal mean, in all investigated river reaches light supply saturated growth of centric diatoms and limited growth of chlorophytes. Loss rates increased with decreased water depth and usually exceeded the potential growth rate of riverine phytoplankton. Longitudinal growth of phytoplankton was observed only in periods of high discharge or along deep river stretches. Sedimentation loss of diatoms was twice as high as that of chlorophytes. The light intensity optimum for growth found and the inverse relationship between water depth and plankton loss to the river bottom explain the lack of plankton in shallow rivers and the occurrence of maximum phytoplankton biomass in medium-sized rivers. Our results support the hypothesis that differences in light-adaptation and in sedimentation loss cause the dominance of chlorophytes in shallow rivers and of diatoms in deeper rivers.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; 													1434-2944	1522-2632					2002	87	2-3					241	254		10.1002/1522-2632(200205)87:2/3<241::AID-IROH241>3.0.CO;2-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1522-2632(200205)87:2/3<241::AID-IROH241>3.0.CO;2-A													WOS:000176258600007

Freshwater Bryozoa of Tonle Sap, Cambodia	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE												We identified a collection of freshwater bryozoans from Tonle Sap (meaning Tonle Lake), Cambodia, a body of water fed by the Mekong River and characterized by extreme fluctuations in water level between the wet and dry seasons. The collection also included specimens from the moat of Angkor Wat, located at the north end of the lake. We found four phylactolaemate species (Plumatella bombayensis, Plumatella casmiana, Plumatella vorstmani, Hyalinella lendenfeldi) and one ctenostome species (Hislopia cambodgiensis) from the lake, and only a single, additional phylactolaemate species (Plumatella javanica) from the moat. We provide brief descriptions of these species, photographs of colonies for some, and photomicrographs by light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of statoblasts. None of the species encountered in this study is endemic to Cambodia, and the wide distributions of the species are possibly related to the dispersability of floatoblasts by birds. We briefly discuss some of the taxonomic problems surrounding Hislopia cambodgiensis.

Geology and hazard implications of the Maraunot notch in the Pinatubo Caldera, Philippines	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The 1991 Pinatubo eruption left 5-6 km(3) of debris on the volcano slopes, much of which has been mobilized into large lahars in the following rainy seasons. Also during the eruption, collapse, localized in part along preexisting faults, left a caldera 2.5 km in diameter that almost immediately began to accumulate a 1.6x10(8) m(3) lake. By 2001, the water had risen to the fault-controlled Maraunot Notch, the lowest, northwestern portion of the caldera rim comprising the physiographic sill of the Caldera Lake. That year, a narrow artificial canal dug into an old volcanic breccia underlying the outlet channel failed to induce a deliberate lake breakout, but discharge from heavy rains in July 2002 rapidly deepened the notch by 23 m, releasing an estimated 6.5x10(7) m(3) of lake water that bulked up into lahars with a volume well in excess of 1.6x10(8) m(3). Lakes in other volcanoes have experienced multiple breakouts, providing practical motivation for this study. Fieldwork and high-resolution digital elevation models reveal andesites and ancient lacustrine deposits, strongly fractured and deformed along a segment of the Maraunot Fault, a prominent, steeply dipping, left-lateral fault zone that trends N35x40 degrees C within and parallel to the notch. Seismicity in 1991 demonstrated that the Maraunot Fault is still active. The fault zone appears to have previously been the erosional locus for a large channel, filled with avalanche or landslide deposits of an earlier eruption that were exhumed by the 2002 breakout floods. The deformed lacustrine sediments, with an uncalibrated C-14 age of 14,760x40 year BP from a single charcoal sample, attest to the existence of an earlier lake, possibly within the Tayawan Caldera, rim remnants of which survive as arcuate escarpments. That lake may well have experienced one or more ancient breakouts as well. The 2002 event greatly reduced the possibility of another such event by scouring away the erodible breccia, leaving less erodible fractured andesites and lacustrine rocks, and by enlarging the outlet channel and its discharge capacity. Several lines of evidence indicate, however, that future lahar-generating lake breakouts at the notch may keep populations of Botolan municipality downstream at risk: (1) a volume of 9.5x10(7) m(3) of lake water remains perched 0.8 km above sea level; (2) seismicity in 1991 demonstrated that the Maraunot Fault is still active and movements of sufficient magnitude could enlarge the outlet and the discharge through it; (3) more likely, however, with or without earthquake activity, landslides from the steep to overhanging channel walls could block the channel again, and a major rainstorm could then cause a rise in lake level and sudden breakouts; (4) intrusion of a new dome into the bottom of the lake, possibly accompanied by phreatic explosions, could expel large volumes of lahar-generating water.					; Lagmay, Alfredo Mahar F./MNO-2869-2025; Zamora, Peter/N-6568-2019	Lagmay, Alfredo Mahar/0000-0001-9672-9389; Rodolfo, Raymond/0000-0002-7236-1353; 													0258-8900					JUN	2007	69	7					797	809		10.1007/s00445-006-0110-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-006-0110-5													WOS:000247385400006

When the data from both years were pooled, post-naupliar cyclopoids formed 76% of the pelagic post-naupliar Copepoda off Bujumbura, 83% off Kigoma and 62% off Mpulungu. During both sampling years, dry weight biomass of post-naupliar copepod stages decreased at sampling sites in the order Bujumbura > Kigoma > Mpulungu. Cyclopoids off Kigoma showed a clear seasonal pattern with one abundance peak in October/November and another at the end of the wet season in April/May. At other locations, neither cyclopoids nor calanoids showed clear seasonal pattern. Correlation of seasonal biomass was low between the first and second dry seasons, and between the first and second wet seasons in all the sampling localities and in all the zooplankton groups. The yearly mean post-naupliar copepod dry weight biomass was estimated as 3.1 g dw m(-2) off Bujumbura, 2.1 g dw m(-2) off Kigoma and 1.5 g dw m(-2) off Mpulungu.																			0018-8158					JUL	1999	407						105	114		10.1023/A:1003793532168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003793532168													WOS:000083710100011

Remedial liming (Ca/MgCO3) has been used in an attempt to restore the pH of the lake water and soil to natural levels. The spatial and temporal variation of metal concentrations in the annual growth rings of trees may be a useful indicator of the effects of the pollutants and the liming operation. We used synchrotron radiation-induced x-ray emission (SRIXE) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to examine the distribution of selected metals in the annual growth rings of red pine (Pinus resinosa) from an area damaged by acid rain and heavy metal pollution which had been subjected to remedial liming (Ca/MgCO3). The results show a non-uniform distribution of metals in the stemwood, including seasonal variations and changes in the Ca/Mn ratio consistent with the increased soil pH following liming.

The population size was 2015 and 2180 in Areas A and B, respectively, of which 1129 and 1298 subjects received stool examination. A total of 230 subjects were identified by the Kato-Katz technique (4 smears per person) as being infected with S. japonicum, 124 in Area A (prevalence 11 %) and 106 in Area B (prevalence 8.2%). They were treated with a single oral dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) in the non-transmission season. A follow-up stool examination was made 50 days after treatment. Among the 220 cases followed, 22 were found stool-egg-positive, with an overall cure rate of 90 %, and 99 % reduction of infection intensity (eggs per gram stool). No significant difference was found in cure rates between the 2 areas (89.7% vs 90.3%). The efficacy of the drug in the area with repeated chemotherapy was not significantly different from that in the newly identified endemic focus. This study, therefore, suggests that the efficacy of praziquantel against S. japonicum has not changed in the Dongting Lake region after more than 14 years of mass chemotherapy, and there is no evidence of tolerance or resistance of S. japonicum against praziquantel.					sleigh, adrian/J-4540-2019; McManus, Don/AAC-5394-2020; Yu, Dongbo/B-5102-2014	Sleigh, Adrian/0000-0001-8443-7864; McManus, Donald/0000-0001-6443-1449; 													0035-9203	1878-3503				SEP-OCT	2001	95	5					537	541		10.1016/S0035-9203(01)90032-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0035-9203(01)90032-X								11706669					WOS:000171984800022
J	Neddermann, K; Nausch, M				Neddermann, K; Nausch, M			Effects of organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds on the activity of bacterial alkaline phosphatase	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The stimulation of bacterial alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) by inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds was investigated in the southern Baltic Sea monthly between February and August 2001, by adding albumin, casein, leucine, ammonium, nitrate, ammonium + glucose or nitrate + glucose to 0.8 mum filtered seawater. The following questions were addressed: (1) Are there seasonal changes in the stimulation of APA by these substances?; (2) Does nitrogen alone stimulate this activity or only in combination with organic carbon?; (3) Is there a relationship between ambient nutrient concentrations and the degree of stimulation? The addition of the mentioned compounds stimulated the APA in bacteria to a high degree, however, there were seasonal variations. Stimulation was low in February and March but high from May to August when the stimulation, e.g., by ammonium + glucose, was up to 6000-fold higher compared with February. In most experiments, the addition of the amino acid leucine and of inorganic nitrogen alone resulted in an inhibition of the bacterial APA. A relationship between ambient nutrient concentrations and the stimulation of the bacterial APA was only observed for albumin, which correlated negatively with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate concentrations and for casein, which correlated only with DIN. The results indicate that the regulation of bacterial APA and the DOP degradation can be significantly influenced by the availability of nitrogen and organic carbon.																			1386-2588						2004	38	4					475	484		10.1007/s10452-004-5666-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-004-5666-6													WOS:000226093700001

The primary production rates used in the analyses were estimated monthly or bimonthly during the growing season (April-November) in 1992, 1996 and 1997 with the C-13 method. Elemental(C, N and P) contents of seston were used to assess nutrient conditions. Analyses revealed that 86% of variance in depth-integrated primary production rates (areal PP) can be explained by changes in light intensity, and sestonic C, N and P concentrations. Water temperature had no effect on areal PP. To assess relative effects of light and nutrients on PP, the P:B ratio was estimated by normalizing PP with sestonic C. The areal P:B ratio correlated most significantly with the sestonic N:P ratio, followed by light intensity. When regression analyses were made at each depth, however, the P:B ratio correlated significantly only with the sestonic N:P ratio at 0 and 1 m depths, while light intensity was also incorporated into the regressions at deeper than 2.5 m. In these regressions, the P:B ratio was negatively correlated with sestonic N:P ratio but positively with light intensity. The results suggest that the primary production rate in this lake was mainly limited by P relative to N supply rates, but was not free from light limitation in a large part of the epilimnion. In Lake Biwa, the vertical water mixing regime as well as the nutrient supply seem to be important in determining the growth and composition of primary producers, since the surface mixing layer extends into 10-15 m depths during most of the growing season.

J	VANEERDEN, MR; VOSLAMBER, B				VANEERDEN, MR; VOSLAMBER, B			MASS FISHING BY CORMORANTS PHALACROCORAX-CARBO-SINENSIS AT LAKE IJSSELMEER, THE NETHERLANDS - A RECENT AND SUCCESSFUL ADAPTATION TO A TURBID ENVIRONMENT	ARDEA												The habit of mass fishing by Cormorants at lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands, is a recent phenomenon. During the first half of the 1970s the birds changed behaviour probably as a result of the deteriorating under water visibility in the lake (3-4 m water depth). The behavioural switch coincided with years of high numbers of Smelt Osmerus eperlanus and Ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus present in the southeastern part of lake Markermeer, the birds' main fishing area at that time. Social fishing by Cormorants is directed towards the catch of relatively small, pelagically dwelling fish. It is argued that for a large water system where social fishing is the rule, a minimum colony size of c. 1000 pairs is required. Typically each colony had one socially fishing group (4000-5000 birds) that slowly changed position through the course of the day. Depending on the direction of the wind the flock's position could greatly change between days. Hunting speed was measured and coincided with maximum swimming speed of medium sized fish prey (15-25 cm). Hunting speed increased during the season probably as a result of the greater swimming speeds of the fish at higher temperatures. Intake rate was closely linked to the birds' position within the flock indicating local depletion of the fished water layer. Mass fishing was especially rewarding at intermediate light intensities under water (50-80 cm Secchi depth, or 300-500 mu E.m(-2)s(-1) at 40 cm depth). The habit of pushing up the fish against the light back-ground of the clear top water layer was only possible when wind caused no greater turbidity than 40 cm Secchi depth (100 mu E.m(-2)s(-1)) which is considered a breakpoint for this kind of behaviour. Adapting the habit of mass fishing effectively enabled the birds to exploit the turbid, rapidly changing environment which resulted in the extension of the foraging range thus maximising colony size relative to the resources available.																			0373-2266						1995	83	1					199	212																WOS:A1995RM43100022
J	Yu, L; Lu, JB				Yu, Lin; Lu, Jianbo			Effects of population size and structure on reproductive success of a Pistacia chinensis population	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The Thousand-Island Lake region, a highly fragmented landscape in Zhejiang Province, China, was selected as a natural laboratory to examine how the reproductive success of a Pistacia chinensis (Anacardiaceae) population was affected by population size and structure. Thirty local island populations and one large mainland population were studied. Pollen density during the flowering season differed significantly among four differently sized populations. The number of pollen grains on the female stigma was positively related to the size of the male population. The 100-seed weight and seed-setting rate of fruits were also significantly correlated with the size of the male population. These results indicated that pollen limitation caused by a reduction in the size of the male population in this fragmented landscape was the main factor that reduced the female reproductive success of the P. chinensis population. In the small population, artificial pollination resulted in significant increases in the 100-seed weight and the seed-setting rate compared with those of untreated individuals. However, artificial pollination did not significantly increase the 100-seed weight or seed-setting rate in the large population. Pollen limitation caused by a reduction in the size of male population was the main factor that reduced the female reproductive success of the P. chinensis population in this fragmented landscape. Thus, the size of populations is an important factor in developing conservation and protection strategies for dioecious plant species in fragmented habitats.

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH												Samples of the polymorphic cladoceran Bosmina longirostris were collected in several lakes and ponds in Western Germany between 1993 and 1999. The shape of the first antennule was used as a qualitative criterion to classify 1241 individuals to three morphs (`longirostris ', `cornuta ', `pellucida ') according to Lieder (Crustacea: Cladocera: Bosminidae. Stuttgart, Germany: Gustav. Fischer Verlag, 1996). Eight morphometric variables were subsequently measured in each individual to quantify size- and shape-related features. Principal component and discriminant analyses were used to describe the morphological variation within and among the three morphs. Seasonal environmental changes modified several traits and thus, cyclomorphosis accounted for a high proportion of within-morph variation. However, there was no gradual change from one morph to another. As well among-morph variation was considerably greater than within-morph variation. Consequently, the disagreement between the qualitative pre-classification and the assignment basing on morphometric discriminant functions was low (4.6-12.0%). Considering that each morph is morphologically well-defined, and that the different morphs coexisted over several generations in the same lake we conclude that they represent different species rather than variants of one polymorphic species. Therefore, we recognize beside the nominal taxon Bosmina longirostris (O.F. Muller 1785) two more species: Bosmina cornuta (Jurine 1820) and Bosmina pellucida Stingelin, 1895.

J	Mutowo, G				Mutowo, Godfrey			Remote sensing lake level fluctuations in response to a changing climate	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Lakes and reservoirs have long been regarded as a solution to the water problems of semi-arid regions, as well as a mitigation measure against the impacts of climate change and climate variability. However, the ability of these lakes to mitigate the impacts of climate change itself has largely been untested. In this study, we tested the utility of remote sensing in monitoring fluctuations in Lake Mutirikwi's surface area. Furthermore, we determined the nature and strength of the relationship between Lake Mutirikwi's surface area and annual rainfall total with a view to understanding the sensitivity of the lake volume to the main input of water in the lake - precipitation. Results of the study show that the volume of the lake fluctuated by between 1% and as much as 90% of the lake's capacity. We also found a significant relationship (r = 0.84, p = 0.002) between the surface area of the lake and the amount of rainfall received in the second half of the rainfall season. We conclude that Lake Mutirikwi is so sensitive to fluctuations in rainfall amounts that it does not offer much mitigation cover in the face of a changing and highly variable climate.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				MAR	2020	11	1					30	38		10.2166/wcc.2018.122	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2018.122													WOS:000526602600002

CONTINUOUS DISCRETE MODE OF DEGRADATION OF THE CHUYA-KURAY ICE-DAMMED LAKE	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												The abrasion-accumulative terraces observed on the sides of the Chuy and Kurai depressions of Gorny Altai indicate the existence of an ice-dammed lake in the Neopleistocene. During the descent of the lake along the sides of the basins in the range of absolute heights of 1531-2133 m, abrasive-accumulative terraces and bars (201 pcs) were formed that fixed the levels of shore abrasion processing. For each level of the lake, quantitative characteristics of the lake basin were obtained; at maximum filling, Chuisko-Kurai Lake had a depth of 673 m, an area of 3054 km(2), and a water volume of 753 km(3). Calculations to determine the speed of shore abrasion processing show that the minimum necessary time for the formation of one terrace is at least one warm season and, therefore, it can be assumed that the descent of Lake Chuisko-Kurai lasted for 200 years. An analysis of changes in the relative heights of the abrasion-accumulating terraces and the corresponding lake levels, based on the results of instrumental measurements and interpretation of satellite images, indicates a continually discrete and long-term process of descent of the lake. It was established that the seasonal trend of water discharge was characterized by a frequency of 5-10 years (with alternating large and small water discharge), which could be caused by climate fluctuations. At the initial stage of the descent of the lake, the water discharge varied between 1000-2120 m(3)/s. Previously postulated provisions that the descent of the lake occurred as a result of the destruction of the dam within a few days or hours, accompanied by water consumption of 10 million m(3)/s, are unjustified erroneous conclusions. The filling of the basin to a maximum absolute height of 2133 m could occur within 1153 years; with an average annual flow rate of 12.8 m(3)/s - 1868 years; and the most probable duration of the existence of the lake basin was 2068 years.

The model is verified independently, and it is also tested within the framework of the High Resolution Limited Area Model(HIRLAM), applied operationally for short range weather forecasting at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The lake model is a slab model based upon energy conservation and treats the lakes as well mixed boxes with depths represented by the mean depths. The model is forced by near surface fluxes calculated from total cloudiness, air temperature, air humidity and low-level winds. A data base, describing 92000 Swedish lakes. provides the model with lake mean depths, areal sizes and locations. When the model is used for parameterization of lake effects in the atmospheric model, all the smaller lakes and the fractions of larger lakes within each horizontal grid square of the atmospheric model are parameterized by four model lakes, representing the lake size distribution. The verification of the lake model is done by comparing it with a more advanced, vertically resolved model, including parameterization of turbulent mixing processes, as well as by comparison with observations. A sensitivity test shows great interannual variations of the ice-covered season, which implies that lake models should be used instead of climate data. The results from an experiment with two-way coupling of the lake model to the atmospheric model are verified by comparing forecasted weather parameters with routine meteorological observations. These results show that the impact of lake effects can reach several degrees C in air temperatures close to the surface.																			0280-6495					OCT	1996	48	5					608	621		10.1034/j.1600-0870.1996.t01-4-00002.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0870.1996.t01-4-00002.x													WOS:A1996VV42600002

There is evidence for an increase in both phytoplankton production and reactive phosphorus concentrations in the loch during the two decades up to 1993. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), plus classification (by Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis: TWINSPAN) of the dataset of time-position samples from the loch revealed that seasonal factors (particularly the thermal regime of the loch, and associated variables) remain more important than non-seasonal environmental variables in predicting changes in phytoplankton community composition. As in the 1970s, the community remains dominated by a diatom-desmid assemblage, but cyanobacteria blooms, albeit at fairly low abundance, are becoming a frequent phenomenon in the south basin of the loch.																			0018-8158					AUG 15	1997	350						63	79		10.1023/A:1003037012226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003037012226													WOS:A1997YE36200006
J	Stea, RR; Mott, RJ				Stea, RR; Mott, RJ			Deglaciation of Nova Scotia: Stratigraphy and chronology of lake sediment cores and buried organic sections	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												The deglaciation of Nova Scotia is reconstructed using the AMS-dated chronology of lake sediments and buried organic sections exposed in the basins of former glacial lakes. Ice cleared out of the Bay of Fundy around 13.5 ka, punctuated by a brief readvance ca. 13-12.5 ka (Ice Flow Phase 4). Glacial Lake Shubenacadie (1) formed in central Nova Scotia, impounded by a lobe of ice covering the northern Bay of Fundy outlet. Drainage was re-routed to the Atlantic Ocean until the Fundy outlet became ice free after 12 ka. When this lake drained, bogs and fens formed on the lake plain during climatic warming. Organic sediment (gyttja) began to accumulate in lake basins throughout Nova Scotia. Glacierization during the Younger Dryas period (ca. 10.8 ka) resulted in the inundation of lakes and lake plains with mineral sediment. The nature and intensity of this mineral sediment flux or "oscillation" varies from south to northern regions. Southern lakes simply record changes in total organic content whereas northern lakes, where most buried peat sections are found, feature a thick inorganic sediment layer. Glacial ice or permanent snow cover and seasonal melting are essential in the formation of this mineral sediment layer; both to provide the water source for erosion, and to prevent plant re-colonization and landscape stabilization. Some northern lakes do not appear to record the Younger Dryas event, with organic accumulation starting around 10 ka. During the Younger Dryas, fine and coarse-grained deposits were deposited in Glacial Lake Shubenacadie (2) and other lowland areas at elevations similar to former (12 ka) lake levels, impounded by re-invigorated residual ice caps and permanent snow/ aufeis.																			0705-7199						1998	52	1					3	21		10.7202/004871ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/004871ar													WOS:000074207700001

It is likely that these resulted from temporary increases in the biomass of previously undetected rare species. 3 Substantial shifts in community dominance were confined to large, early season events, and were seldom long-lived. Later 'climax' communities were highly resistant to any changes in dominance, even when increases in species richness occurred. 4 Regardless of when they occurred, disturbances tended to favour species from a narrow range of the successional sequence.																			0046-5070					NOV	1999	42	3					503	512		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00491.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00491.x													WOS:000083843900009
J	Wilhelm, FM; Parker, BR; Schindler, DW; Donald, DB				Wilhelm, FM; Parker, BR; Schindler, DW; Donald, DB			Seasonal food habits of bull trout from a small alpine lake in the Canadian Rocky Mountains	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We investigated the seasonal diet of a native, undisturbed population of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus in an alpine lake to examine predation patterns between fish size-classes and in relation to available invertebrate prey. The diets of small (less than or equal to 250 mm in fork length, FL) and large (>250 mm FL) bull trout were similar. Bull trout fed on seasonally abundant prey species. After ice-out in July, the diet was dominated by chironomid pupae. Daphnia pulex var. and the amphipod Gammarus lacustris dominated the diet in August and September. Both Daphnia and Gammarus reproduced before bull trout switched to preying on them in early August. Bull trout fed size-selectively on large individuals of both Daphnia and Gammarus. Large bull trout preyed on larger Daphnia than did small bull trout. Fish of both size-classes consumed large Gammarus. Bull trout were spatially segregated; small fish occupied shallow water(<l m deep), while large fish occupied the profundal offshore zone. Spatial segregation prevented small bull trout from cropping small immature Daphnia in offshore areas. Average total food volume in stomachs of small fish increased between July and September whereas it decreased in large fish. The latter were frequently emaciated, indicating that large individuals may be food limited for much of the open-water period. Our data and observations suggest that prey switching, timing of prey reproduction, and spatial segregation of the fish population by size are tightly coupled and contribute to the survival of the key prey species. The survival of a variety of invertebrate species, including large Gammarus, in the presence of bull trout suggests that stocks of this fish species could be increased by stocking small mountain lakes without severely affecting the native invertebrate fauna.

Estimated mean Karner blue adult life span was less than 3.5 days. Populations exhibited protandry and about a 2:1 male:female sex ratio at population peak within a brood. Ranges, or maximum distances moved by individual butterflies, were typically less than 100 m. Maximum ranges were less than 1 km. These distances are similar to those reported for other lycaenid butterflies and from other studies of the Karner blue in the midwestern United States. At two sites, fewer than 2% of adults had ranges greater than 300 m, while at a third site 4.3% of adults had ranges greater than 300 m. Given typical subpopulation sizes these movement percentages suggest that few adults per generation will move between subpopulations separated by more than 300 m. Movement of individuals between subpopulation sites is important for maintaining genetic diversity within a metapopulation and for recolonizing areas following local extinctions. Therefore, prudent conservation planning should aim for a landscape with habitat patches suitable for Karner blue butterfly occupancy separated by less than 300 m.																			0885-8608					APR	1999	19	2					109	120																WOS:000079839700004

The temporary ponds here include 10 species of branchiopods, 5 anostracans, 2 notostracans and 3 conchostracans (all belonging to the Spinicaudata group). This diversity represents 53% of the species known in Yugoslavia. Community structure, spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of the species were analyzed over the period 1991-1995. More than one species was found in about 67% of ponds. The maximum number of coexisting species was 7. Anostracans were the most common as a group, while the notostracan Triops cancriformis and the conchostracan Leptestheria saetosa were the most frequent species. A high frequency of coexistence was established. Regarding community structure, two significantly different periods during the season were distinguished: the first, from the end of February to mid-April, and the second, from mid-April to the end of July. This extensive pool longevity may underlie the high diversity in this region.

J	GRAUMLICH, LJ				GRAUMLICH, LJ			RESPONSE OF TREE GROWTH TO CLIMATIC VARIATION IN THE MIXED CONIFER AND DECIDUOUS FORESTS OF THE UPPER GREAT-LAKES REGION	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Tree-ring data were used to define regional tree-growth anomalies (i.e., recurring spatial patterns of growth that differ froin long-term averages) for 11 species growing in a network of sites spanning the deciduous and mixed hardwood-conifer forest boundary in the upper Great Lakes region. Tree-ring samples were collected at 11 sites that are classified as mesic to dry-mesic based on species composition. At each stand at least 20 trees were sampled of each species dominant in the canopy, resulting in one to five species collections per stand and 31 chronologies in total. Principal component analysis was used to define the common variance among the chronologies. Three components explain 57.4% of the variation among the chronologies, indicating that common patterns of tree growth exist within the multispecies network. Component loadings indicate that (i) species to species variation is more important than site to site variation and (ii) species can be segregated into distinct groups based on their common patterns of growth through time. Correlations between the three-component-score time series and climatic data indicate that growth anomaly patterns are weakly, but significantly, correlated with growing-season temperature and precipitation variables. Extreme climatic events (i.e., greater than 1 SD above or below the mean) are very important in generating differential growth rates among the species sampled.

Total length and fish and gonad weight were measured monthly for both species. Length maxima for female and male B. paludinosus were 130 mm and 113 mm respectively, and for female and male B. trimaculatus 120 mm and 85 mm respectively. Lengths-at-first-maturity for female and male B. paludinosus were 69 mm and 64 mm respectively, and for B. trimaculatus 61 mm and 59 mm respectively. Lengths-at-first-capture were 62.4 mm for B. paludinosus and 71.8 mm for B. trimaculatus. Females predominated 3: 1 over males in both species. For the Barbus fishery in Lake Chilwa the optimal stretched mesh size for matemba seine-nets, in terms of rendering the fishery sustainable, was 10.53 mm. Barbus breed throughout the year, with a minor peak in April-March and a major breeding peak in October-January. Before the rainy season, Barbus migrate to the marshes, marginal swamps and the Mnembo River mouth to breed. Fishery management recommendations to ensure successful breeding and recruitment of Barbus into the fishery include: (1) a closed season for active fishing gears targeting Barbus spp. and juvenile tilapias from October to February for the lake and riverine fishing, (2) the increase of the permitted stretch mesh size for matemba seine-nets to 10.53 mm and (3) protection of the marshes, swamps and river habitats which act as breeding grounds for the Barbus spp.																			1608-5914	1727-9364				AUG	2009	34	2					123	130		10.2989/AJAS.2009.34.2.2.889	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/AJAS.2009.34.2.2.889													WOS:000269753500002

A conservative estimate indicates that there are at least 77 genera and some 130 species of plants involved. This is all the more surprising because the plant- and animal-remains originate from a sink-hole no more than 150 by 200 m. The proximity of different plant communities is responsible for the richness of the assemblage. The floristic affinities lie in present-day eastern Asia and to a lesser extent in northern America and Europe. Judging from the climatic requirements of living counterparts, growth ring data and the high percentage of deciduousness, the climate was seasonal with mean temperatures slightly higher than at present.

J	Hwang, SJ; Heath, RT				Hwang, SJ; Heath, RT			The distribution of protozoa across a trophic gradient, factors controlling their abundance and importance in the plankton food web	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The relative contribution of protozoan biomass to whole planktonic communities (phytoplankton, picophytoplankton, bacterioplankton, protozoa and zooplankton) and factors important in controlling protozoan abundance were investigated at two eutrophic coastal sites and two meso-oligotrophic offshore sites in the central basin of Lake Erie, USA, from May through August in 1993 and 1994. The abundance and biomass of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) and ciliates (and also other plankton components) were significantly higher at the coastal sites than at the offshore sites. HNAN dominated numerically at all sites most of the time, but the biomass of phototrophic nanonagellates (PNAN) was as high as that of HNAN, indicating that the average size of PNAN was larger. Percent protozoan carbon content was always higher at the offshore sites than the coastal sites, due to relatively lower phyto- and zooplankton biomass at the offshore sites. The percent contribution of heterotrophic protozoans (both HNAN and ciliates) also showed the same trend. Correlations between protozoan abundance and other parameters were stronger at the offshore sites than the coastal sites. When correlating data over the coastal to offshore transect, both HNAN and ciliate abundances were significantly correlated with total phosphorus (TP) and the abundance of bacteria, nauplii and copepods. These results suggest that both bottom-up and top-down factors may be important in controlling protozoan abundance, and suggest that protozoans are important as a carbon link in the microbial food web of Lake Erie.					; Hwang, Sunjin/AAK-7149-2020	Hwang, Soon-Jin/0000-0001-7083-5036; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				APR	1997	19	4					491	518		10.1093/plankt/19.4.491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.4.491													WOS:A1997WT34400006

High concentrations of nutrients were recorded, while the range of Chlorophyll-a values varied between13-44 mug/l, reflecting the eutrophic character of the lake. Cyanophytes were the most important group during the warm period. The phytoplankton seasonal sequence is mainly correlated with environmental factors.																			1018-4619					DEC	2001	10	12					845	849																WOS:000174116700001

Evaluating creel survey efficiency for estimating walleye fishery metrics in northern Wisconsin lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To determine whether creel survey efficiency can be improved in northern Wisconsin lakes, we compared estimates of effort, harvest rate, harvest, recapture rate for previously marked fish (R/C ratio), and recaptures of walleyes Sander vitreus from four reduced-sampling-effort schemes (eliminating I week per month, 2 weeks per month, odd-numbered weeks, and even-numbered weeks) in each month of the angling season with estimates from creel surveys during 1991-2002. Estimates of angler-hours from each reduced-sampling-effort scheme differed significantly from those from the full sampling effort in several months, and variances differed significantly in nearly all months. Estimates of walleyes harvested per hour from each reduced-sampling-effort scheme differed significantly from those from the full sampling effort only in May or June, and variances differed significantly in several months for all sampling effort schemes except that of I week per month. Estimates of walleye harvest from all reduced-sampling-effort schemes differed significantly from those from the full sampling effort for at most 2 months, but variances did not differ significantly in several months. Estimates of the R/C ratio from all reduced-sampling-effort schemes differed significantly from those from the full sampling effort for at most 2 months, but variances differed significantly in several months. Estimates of the number of recaptures differed significantly from those from the full sampling effort for several months with the elimination of I week per month and 2 weeks per month but did not differ significantly with the elimination of odd- or even-numbered weeks, and variances differed significantly in several months for all reduced-sampling-effort schemes. Creel survey efficiency cannot be improved using these sampling effort reductions without causing significant losses in accuracy and precision.

J	Greenberg, CH; McGrane, A				Greenberg, CH; McGrane, A			A comparison of relative abundance and biomass of ground-dwelling arthropods under different forest management practices	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Habitat structural characteristics and relative abundance and biomass of ground-dwelling arthropods were compared among four replicated stand treatments: intense burning and salvage logging; clearcutting followed by roller-chopping (100% soil surface disturbance); clearcutting followed by bracke seeding (30% soil surface disturbance); and naturally regenerated mature, forested sand pine scrub. Arthropods were classified by taxa and by mean maximum width. Monthly trends in abundance and biomass of arthropods captured are described. Mature forest differed from the three disturbance treatments in most habitat structural features, but disturbance treatments were similar. Total numbers and dry weight did not differ among treatments but more individuals and biomass of arthropods less than 5 mm mean maximum width occurred in burned sites. There were significantly more arthropods 10 mm or less in mean maximum width than over 10 mm, but arthropods 5-10 mm had the highest biomass. The relative abundance of some taxa differed among treatments, and taxa differed in monthly capture rates. Total numbers and biomass of captured arthropods were greatest from late May through November.																			0378-1127					DEC	1996	89	1-3					31	41		10.1016/S0378-1127(96)03868-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1127(96)03868-6													WOS:A1996WB33400004
J	Boon, PI; Virtue, P; Nichols, PD				Boon, PI; Virtue, P; Nichols, PD			Microbial consortia in wetland sediments: A biomarker analysis of the effects of hydrological regime, vegetation and season on benthic microbes	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Microbial consortia in the sediments from a permanent wetland near Albury-Wodonga in north-eastern Victoria, Australia (Ryans 1 Billabong), and an ephemeral wetland near Shepparton in central Victoria (Raftery's Swamp) were quantified by analyses of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), polar lipid ether lipid (PLEL), sterol and alcohol profiles. Prokaryotic organisms dominated the benthic assemblages in both wetlands, Total prokaryotic abundance (i,e. eubacteria plus archaea) was estimated to be (7-17) x 10(9) cells g(-1) sediment (dry weight). Methanogenic archaea were estimated to number (1-5.4) x 10(9) cells g(-1) and to account for 11-35% of the total benthic prokaryotes; these values are apparently among the highest recorded for temperate lake or river environments, PLFAs indicative of specific metabolic groups (e.g. sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanotrophic bacteria, etc.) were also detected. The PLFA profiles indicated that Type I methanotrophs (abundant in C-16 PLFAs) were more abundant than the Type II group, which contain C-18 PLFAs. Acetate-utilizing SRB were more abundant than were lactate-utilizing SRB, but neither group was dominant. Ergosterol was not detected, which suggested that fungi were not a significant component of the benthic microbial consortia in spite of both wetlands having abundant inputs from aquatic and fringing vascular plants, Other biomarkers, such as sterols, long-chain alcohols, triterpenoids and phytol, demonstrated inputs from these higher plants. PLFA, PLEL and sterol profiles indicated that benthic microbial consortia were affected by hydrological regime, the presence of aquatic vegetation, and season. Information from this preliminary study may assist in the making of informed management decisions on environmental water allocations for natural ecosystems.

J	Dzus, EH; Bortolotti, GR; Gerrard, JM				Dzus, EH; Bortolotti, GR; Gerrard, JM			Does sex-biased hatching order in bald eagles vary with food resources?	ECOSCIENCE												In birds that exhibit sexual size dimorphism, hatching asynchrony, and siblicide, the probability of nestling mortality and the cost of rearing young may vary with different combinations of sex and hatching sequence. When food abundance varies spatially and temporally, parents may maximize their fitness by manipulating their primary sex ratio. We examined the sex and hatching order of nestling bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) over 17 years on one lake and 5 years on another. The lakes are approximately the same size, but differ dramatically in eagle density and prey abundance. In years when the number of eaglets fledged was high (suggesting higher food abundance), there was a significant bias in the first-hatched chick toward the larger sex (females), and broods with a first-hatched male and a second-hatched female (MF broods) were under-represented. In years with lower productivity, and on the lake with lower food abundance, there was a male-bias in the population sex ratio of nestlings and the first-hatched egg. Variation in sex ratio and hatching order may relate to the probability of siblicide associated with MF broods, or the differential cost of raising the sexes.																			1195-6860						1996	3	3					252	258		10.1080/11956860.1996.11682339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1996.11682339													WOS:A1996VJ70800002

Effect of simulated emerald ash borer infestation on nitrogen cycling,in black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands in northern Minnesota, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands are an important economic, cultural, and ecological resource in the northern Great Lake States, USA, and are threatened by the invasive insect, emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmmaire [EAB]). EAB-induced ash mortality can increase air temperatures, alter understory vegetation communities, and modify wetland hydrology by elevating the water table following canopy dieback, which may, in turn, alter nitrogen cycling in wetland soils and affect plant N uptake, N export to watersheds, and N emissions to the atmosphere. We sampled soils in replicated 1.6-ha plots six years after the following treatments were applied: girdling all ash greater than six cm diameter to simulate EAB-induced mortality, clearcutting with removal of all trees, and an unharvested control. In situ samples were collected from soil cores and from adjacent bulk areas influenced by vegetation to measure the concentration and rates of accumulation of inorganic nitrogen over the 2017 growing season. In the soil cores, the greatest nitrogen accumulation occurred in the unharvested control treatment and nitrate/nitrite were the dominant species of inorganic N. In contrast, in bulk soils, the clearcut treatment had greater overall nitrogen mineralization than both the control and girdle ' treatments, and ammonium had a greater relative abundance than nitrite/nitrate. Potential N mineralization (assessed with a lab incubation) was not affected by treatment, indicating that treatment effects observed in the field were likely due to changes in the microenvironment. Overall, the effect of simulated EAB on net nitrogen mineralization rates was minimal as mineralization was greatly constrained by ecosystem conditions compared to suitable, laboratory conditions, under which potential N mineralization was an order of magnitude greater than measured in the field. However, canopy treatment influenced water table levels, soil temperature, and vegetation communities, all of which influenced the relative abundance of inorganic N species. Our findings indicate limited indirect effects of EAB on net N mineralization in black ash wetlands.					; D'Amato, Anthony/AAV-3245-2021; Venterea, Rodney/A-3930-2009	Venterea, Rodney/0000-0002-9003-2318; 													0378-1127	1872-7042				FEB 15	2020	458								117769	10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117769													WOS:000512219500021
J	Landman, MJ; Ling, N				Landman, Michael J.; Ling, Nicholas			Fish health changes in Lake Okaro, New Zealand: effects of nutrient remediation, season or eutrophication?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The purpose of this investigation was to measure the in situ health of selected biota with respect to a large-scale application of an aluminium-amended zeolite (Z2G1) in Lake Okaro, New Zealand. We hypothesized that, based on previous laboratory toxicity testing, the Z2G1 application would have minimal or no significant health effects on lake fauna. To test this hypothesis, two sampling events were timed around the Z2G1 application to examine the health of two finfish species (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Gobiomorphus cotidianus) and crayfish (Paranephrops planifrons). Additionally, the same species were sampled from the neighbouring Lake Rerewhakaaitu in order to delineate seasonal and lake-specific effects. A general lack of aluminium accumulation in animal tissues following the application indicated that Z2G1-derived aluminium was not readily bioavailable. An unexplained osmoregulatory disturbance, indicated by increased blood plasma ion concentrations in Lake Okaro trout, was observed following the application, but could not be directly attributed to Z2G1 exposure. Changes in fish haematology over time and between lake populations were interpreted as physiological responses to seasonal changes in lake conditions. Using a broad range of specific and non-specific endpoints it was concluded that there were no obvious negative impacts on fish health resulting from Z2G1 exposure.					; Ling, Nicholas/Q-4179-2017	Landman, Michael/0000-0003-0465-8080; Ling, Nicholas/0000-0002-0853-7035													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2011	661	1					65	79		10.1007/s10750-010-0315-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0315-7													WOS:000285064900006

An intermittent increase in N2O was clearly observed in the Bang Nara River, with a tropical swamp catchment at the beginning of rainy season of November 1997. The intramolecular distribution of isotopes clearly demonstrated that nitrification is the major process for the production of N2O.

This sandstone-dominated formation rests conformably on the Bainmedart Coal Measures and represents the upper part of the Permian-Triassic Amery Group. It is divisible into three members: the Ritchie, Jetty and McKelvey members (in ascending order). Nine sedimentary facies assignable to three facies associations (major channel, crevasse/fan and flood-basin deposits) are recognized within the formation. Ritchie Member sedimentation took place during a transition from consistently hygric to seasonally dry conditions and the unit comprises sandstone-dominated, sheet-like channel deposits interspersed with few, thin, mottled, haematite-rich flood-basin siltstones. Deposition took place under fluctuating discharge conditions chiefly within the channel tracts of axially (northwesterly/northeasterly) flowing, low-sinuosity braided rivers. The Jetty Member shows a gross upward-fining profile dominated in the lower part by poorly sorted pebbly sandstones and in the upper part by ferruginous mudcracked siltstones, mottled palaeosols, calcrete and thin massive sandstone sheets. This unit reflects deposition of easterly directed alluvial fans and extensive flood-basin silt under a semi-arid climatic regime. The Upper Triassic sandstone-dominated McKelvey Member shows a return to axial drainage along the Lambert Graben with sedimentation occurring primarily within low-sinuosity braided channel tracts under wetter climatic conditions.

Annual total nitrogen (TN) loads, estimated from observations of water quality and river flow, increased from 860 to 920 t with a corresponding increase in NO3-N concentration during the cool season. In contrast, total phosphorus (TP) loads decreased from 96 to 62 t. Annual TN and TP loads, calculated using emission factors and annual statistics for the catchments, showed a tendency to decline from 1986 to 2002. No source could be identified which would result in the increase in TN in the catchments, therefore, the increase in observed TN loads was considered to originate in other areas. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition transported from long distances has elevated the sum of NH4-N and NO3-N concentration in rainwater in the cool season. Therefore, it was considered that this resulted in the increase in TN loads in the Hii River.																			1860-1871	1860-188X				MAY	2008	4	1					39	46		10.1007/s11355-008-0040-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-008-0040-9													WOS:000257876400005
J	Epp, GT				Epp, GT			Grazing on filamentous cyanobacteria by Daphnia pulicaria	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												I conducted short-term grazer-gradient experiments to assess direct mortality effects of Daphnia pulicaria on phytoplankton species in natural lake phytoplankton assemblages that contained 20-80% filamentous cyanobacteria by biovolume. Filamentous cyanobacteria often interfere with feeding by large cladoceran zooplankton such as D. pulicaria and can limit their distribution, yet some D. pulicaria populations coexist with filamentous cyanobacteria. In my trials, D. pulicaria from Oneida Lake and Cazenovia Lake, New York, consumed three species of filamentous cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Anabaena flos-aquae, Anabaena wisconsinense) but avoided three other species of Anabaena. Despite high filament concentrations, Daphnia consumed diatoms, flagellates, and chlorococcales and reduced overall phytoplankton abundance. Coexistence of Daphnia and filamentous cyanobacteria in these lakes apparently is facilitated by undeterred consumption of some species and avoidance of others, without substantial interference.																			0024-3590					MAY	1996	41	3					560	567		10.4319/lo.1996.41.3.0560	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.3.0560													WOS:A1996UW65700020

Compared with tern eggs from Lake Poygan, eggs from Green Bay had significantly higher median concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), other polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), total (three congeners) non-ortho, ortho''s PCBs, five individual PCB congeners known to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and several other organochlorine contaminants. Conversions of analytical concentrations of TCDD and PCB congeners based on relative AHH induction potencies allowed for estimation of total 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents. Two PCB congeners, 2,3,3'',4,4''- and 3,3'',4,4''5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PeCB) accounted for more than 90% of the median estimated TCDD equivalents at both Green Bay and Lake Poygan. The median estimated TCDD equivalents were almost 11-fold higher in tern eggs from Green Bay than in eggs from Lake Poygan (2175 and 201 pg/g). The hatching success of Green Bay sibling eggs from nests where eggs were collected for contaminant analyses was 75% lower at Green Bay than at Lake Poygan. Hatchability of eggs taken from other nests and artificially incubated was about 50% lower for Green Bay than for Lake Poygan. Among hatchlings from laboratory incubation, those from Green Bay weighed approximately 20% less and had a mean liver weight to body weight ratio 26% greater than those from Lake Poygan. In both field and laboratory, mean minimum incubation periods were significantly longer for eggs from Green Bay compared to Lake Poygan (8.25 and 4.58 days, respectively). Mean minimum incubation time for Green Bay eggs in the field was 4.37 days longer than in the laboratory. Hatchability was greatly improved when Green Bay eggs were incubated by Lake Poygan adults in an egg-exchange experiment, but was sharply decreased in Lake Poygan eggs incubated in Green Bay nests. Nest abandonment and egg disappearance were substantial at Green Bay but nil at Lake Poygan. Thus, not only factors intrinsic to the egg, but also extrinsic factors (parental attentiveness), impaired reproductive outcome at Green Bay. The epidemiological evidence from this study strongly suggested that contaminants were a causal factor. AHH-active PCB congeners (intrinsic effects) and PCBs in general (extrinsic effects) appeared to be the only contaminants at the concentrations measured in eggs, capable of producing the effects that were observed at Green Bay.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				SEP	1989	18	5					706	727		10.1007/BF01225009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01225009								2802675					WOS:A1989AL95600009
J	Matveev, V				Matveev, V			Testing predictions of the lake food web theory on pelagic communities of Australian reservoirs	OIKOS												Several predictions of the theory developed for pelagic food webs of the Northern Hemisphere were tested on water bodies of Eastern Australia. Eleven reservoirs, representing trophic and latitudinal gradients were sampled for nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton and pelagic fish. Two models of regression analysis, which analysed possible interactions between trophic levels were based oil different sets of data. In one, each reservoir was represented by only one pair of observations annual mean or single observation ("regional model"). In the other, seasonal means of four frequently sampled reservoirs similar in productivity were used ("temporal model"). Significant variation in total phytoplankton biovolume (TPB) was predicted by total phosphorus concentration (TP), total nitrogen concentration (TN), mean crustacean length and acoustic biomass of planktivorous fish in both models. This suggested that nutrient limitation, zooplankton grazing and positive effects of fish were probably important in controlling the biomass of primary producers at both regional and temporal scales. In the regional model, the biomass of fish was also negatively correlated with Daphnia biomass and mean crustacean length, suggesting that the trophic cascade hypothesis may be applicable to Eastern Australia for the considered range of reservoir productivities. The biovolume of cyanobacteria was not correlated to any variables tested in the regional model. In contrast, nutrient and food web variables had significant effects on cyanobacterial biovolume in the temporal model. This suggested that factors governing seasonal succession were probably more important for cyanobacteria than variation in reservoir productivity or location. Contrary to previous views, no negative relationship between total biomass of zooplankton and TPB was found in both models. suggesting that the community structure of zooplankton rather than its total biomass mediates top-down effects. Many predictions of the food web theory remained robust in spite of substantial differences in animal taxonomy and physical environment of Australian ecosystems.

Three distinct size classes of Hypseleotris were observed. The smallest (<16 mm standard length (SL)) fish undertake a vertical diurnal migration in the pelagic throughout the year, spending daylight hours near the surface and night hours in deeper waters. The diet of this size class consists almost exclusively of zooplankton (98.6% total prey volume), with cladocera and copepoda dominating the identifiable prey items. A larger (12-20 mm SL) size class group of subadult/adult fish occupies the near-shore littoral throughout the daylight hours but moves out of the sampled area during the night. The diet of this size class is more diverse (zooplankton 58.5%, macro-invertebrate 25.0%, other 16.5%). The largest size class (>20 mm SL) of adult Hypseleotris remains in the near-shore littoral throughout seasonal and diurnal cycles and has a more eclectic diet than the other two size classes (zooplankton 28.8%, macro-invertebrate 28.9%, other 42.3%). Spatial and temporal differences in the distribution and diet of these three size class groups are discussed with reference to the abundance and availability of suitable prey, intraspecific competitive exclusion, predator avoidance and water quality.

The species of arsenic present, their behaviour and toxicity will change depending on the biotic and abiotic conditions in the water. In groundwater, arsenic is predominantly present as arsenite (As-III) and arsenate (As-V). The major arsenic species in freshwater are As-III and As-V and minor amounts of MMA, DMA and methylated As-III have also be detected. In seawater, the arsenic speciation differs in the surface and deep zone. In addition to the above species, uncharacterized arsenic species may constitute a significant portion of the total arsenic present in some water and the identification of these compounds is necessary to fully understand the arsenic biogeochemistry in water.

J	Chikita, KA				Chikita, Kazuhisa A.			Topographic effects on the thermal structure of Himalayan glacial lakes: Observations and numerical simulation of wind	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												The thermal structure of two Himalayan glacial lakes, Tsho Rolpa and Imja in the eastern Nepal, was examined by observations in the pre-monsoon seasons of 1996 and 1997. Tsho Rolpa had an isothermal mixed layer at water depths of 0-20 in, whereas Imja did not possess such an isothermal layer. This difference in the thermal structure is explained by the condition that diurnal valley winds, producing wind-driven currents, blow strongly near the water surface of Tsho Rolpa, but very weakly near that of Imja. The wind observations above or near the end moraine indicated that a daily wind system of strong, diurnal valley winds and weak, nocturnal mountain winds is common to the lakes. It was suggested that with respect to the valley winds, the weak winds near the surface of Imja result from topographic screening effects of the upwind dead-ice zone and end moraine 20-25 in higher than the water surface. In order to ascertain the topographic effects, three-dimensional numerical simulation of airflow was carried out by making topographic models of actual size in the calculation domain, corresponding to Tsho Rolpa and Imja and their surrounding topography. The simulation revealed that, when winds blow at constant velocities of 1-5 in s(-1) at 2 in above the points corresponding to the weather stations, the wind velocity at 2 in above the water surface for Imja is 33-42% smaller than for Tsho Rolpa. With increasing heights of the end moraine and dead-ice zone, the wind velocity near the lake surface efficiently decreased by decreasing the lake length from 3.1 or 2.2 km to 1.2 km.

Increasing nutrient load due to multifarious anthropogenic activities usually alters the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in water [pCO(2)(water)] dynamics in such aquatic systems. In this regard, the effect of nutrient level alteration [8 times and 24 times, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in addition, respectively] on chl-a and pCO(2)(water) was tested upon waters of EKW aquaculture ponds in three different seasons by means of microcosm for 8 consecutive days. In both DIN 8x and DIP 8x treatments, an overall increase in chl-a concentrations was observed by the end of experiment; however, in DIN 24x and DIP 24x treatments, chl-a in most of the seasons was found to diminish after a steep rise in its concentration during 4th or 5th day. In all the seasons, the surface waters were supersaturated with CO2 under in situ conditions. The extent of supersaturation enhanced with nutrient addition during monsoon; however, in post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, nutrient addition led to undersaturation of CO2. Though chl-a concentration exhibited substantial variability during the microcosm experiments, the variation in trophic state index was not that much remarkable. In DIN-treated microcosms, uptake rate of DIP was significantly high compared to the reverse scenario, which implied that DIP has a more limiting character than DIN. In P-enriched treatments, the lack of N supplies probably limit production of autotrophic biomass. Thus it can be concluded that the nature of sewage and its DIN/DIP content can significantly alter the primary productivity the CO2 dynamics of such aquaculture ponds in future.

They host endemic taxa, adapted to live in extreme environments. Among adaptations, production of diapausing eggs allows for overcoming the cold season. These diapausing eggs can rest in the sediments, providing a biotic reservoir known as an egg bank. Here, we estimated changes in abundance of the egg bank in two lakes in the Khumbu Region of the Himalayas, during the last ca. 1100 and 500 years, respectively, by analyzing two sediment cores. We tested viability of the diapausing eggs extracted from different layers of the sediment cores under laboratory conditions. We found that only diapausing eggs of the Monogont rotifer Hexarthra bulgarica nepalensis were able to hatch, thus suggesting that a permanent egg bank is lacking for the other taxa of the lakes, not least for the two Daphnia species described from these sites. Our results confirm previous studies suggesting that in high mountain lakes, the production of diapausing is mainly devoted to seasonal recruitment, therefore leading to a nonpermanent egg bank. The different ability of different taxa to leave viable diapausing eggs in the sediments of high mountain lakes therefore poses serious constraints to capability of buffering risk of biodiversity loss in these extremely fragile environments.

J	Nurminen, L; Horppila, J; Tallberg, P				Nurminen, L; Horppila, J; Tallberg, P			Seasonal development of the cladoceran assemblage in a turbid lake: the role of emergent macrophytes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In eutrophic Lake Hiidenvesi, the water is turbid and the biomass of submerged macrophytes consequently low. In such lakes, due to low refuge availability, the highest zooplankton biomass usually occurs in the beginning of the growing season. In L. Hiidenvesi, however, the highest biomasses are found in late July-early August. To clarify the role of emergent macrophytes, we investigated the seasonal development in cladoceran community structure and biomass in different zones of an emergent macrophyte bed (Typha argustifolia). Total cladoceran biomass in the different zones did not differ, but the biomass of free-swimming filter feeders was significantly higher within the emergent stand than at the edge or outside the stand. This was mostly due to the higher biomass of Bosmina longirostris in the inner zone. Mean size of Ceriodaphnia quadrangula was also highest within the stand. The biomass of free-swimming filter feeders peaked on 7 July at 40 mug C/I and declined rapidly thereafter, whereas at the edge and outside the stand the biomass remained below 5 mug C/I throughout the study period. The observed seasonal development of the cladoceran community was probably a consequence of concomitant changes in the predation pressure and refuge availability. At the edge and outside the stand, the estimated consumption by free-swimming filter feeders remained below 10 % of phytoplankton biomass, while in the inner zone it reached 70 %. Outside the emergent stand, the estimated grazing pressure by the plant-associated Sida crystallina was higher than total consumption of the free-swimming species. The result demonstrated that also nymphaeids (which were found outside the emergent stand) may be of great importance for herbivorous zooplankton, especially plant-associated species.																			0003-9136					APR	2001	151	1					127	140																WOS:000168327200008

The 23 abundant species (54 species in total) were divided into the following four distributional types: (1) Pterostichus adstrictus Eschz. was numerous in all five habitats (habitat generalist); (2) Platynus decentis Say, Calathus ingratus Dej., and Scaphinotus marginatus Fisch. were abundant in all four forest habitats (forest generalists); (3) another 10 species were common in one or two forest habitats (forest specialists); (4) nine species, representing mainly Agonum, Amara, and Bembidion, were restricted to a recently cleared timothy-clover grassland (meadow species). Soil moisture seemed to be important in determining habitat associations of the species among the forest types. Captures of most species were aggregated also within habitats, and the consistency of aggregation among particular traps suggests that it is mainly a response to subtle microhabitat differences. All abundant species, except S. marginatus, showed a peak of capture in May-June. Number of species, corrected for sample size by rarefaction, was highest in the meadow (27.5) and lowest in the dry upland aspen forest (11.9). Species diversity was highest in meadow and the lakeside forest habitats, but carabid assemblages of thc four forest habitats were more similar to each other than to the meadow assemblage.																			0008-347X					MAY-JUN	1992	124	3					521	540		10.4039/Ent124521-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/Ent124521-3													WOS:A1992JC49500008

Development strategies for a coastal resort in Southern Mozambique	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT												As part of a long-term monitoring project studying coastal development, a number of rapid scan field surveys and project interventions were conducted in Ponta do Ouro, at the southern border of Mozambique. Here we report on four issues in support of sustainable development: 1. Tourism, 2. Water supplies, 3. Biodiversity and 4. Governance. In our tourism study, we interviewed tourists and managers, and placed a researcher as an intern in a beach camp to assess management and interactions. Tourism brings in about $3 Million in revenue annually. The seasonal variability in demand requires managers to adjust staffing levels to ensure viability. Local staff is insensitive to profit margins - so tend to resist. Tourists come for the beach and scuba-diving, and do not want development. In our water study; quality, supply and demand were quantified at source and community level. It was found that the local lake will meet the needs of the entire population including tourists in peak season, if a small pay-for-service can be developed. Currently, most of the community hand-carry water from open wells. In the biodiversity study: botanical and zoological species richness was assessed in three different habitats: dune forest, grassland, and wetland; all within close proximity of the resort. In addition fish species on the coral reefs were identified during a scuba dive. It is suggested that zoological richness at order level of classification is the most useful indicator of bio-diversity and the need for conservation. In the governance study, a plan for the development of a town services department was presented to key stakeholders, and reactions were gauged. Leasehold taxes are diverted to the district and national level, leaving little for infrastructure improvements and services. It was found that the rural community members strongly support a local services department, and indicated a willingness to pay. However, most business managers have water and other services; and believe that 'development' would disturb the tranquillity and lead to an influx of migrant workers. Hence there is little consensus on the need for governance to be localised. Inevitably, mass tourism projects will provide in-direct benefits and services, as this coastal resort develops.																			1993-8233					JAN 18	2011	5	2					481	504																WOS:000290631900025
J	Hahn, S; Reinhardt, K				Hahn, Steffen; Reinhardt, Klaus			Habitat preference and reproductive traits in the Antarctic midge Parochlus steinenii (Diptera: Chironomidae)	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												We provide the first comprehensive account of habitat preference, mating, oviposition and developmental stages of Parochlus steinenii. There are eight records from the South Shetland Islands. On King George Island, none out of 40 temporary ponds and 9% out of 44 lakes with variable water levels were inhabited by P steinenii. By contrast, 94% of 52 lakes with stable water levels were occupied, for 92% of which breeding was confirmed. Lakes were occupied independently of their height above sea level ranging from 5 to 115 in. The midges aggregated at two different microhabitats at the shoreline of lakes. Terrestrial swarms of more than 5000 individuals at open wind sheltered rocks were strongly dominated by males. Their mean density was 40, their maximum 150 ind. cm(-2). Aggregations under stones at the water edge showed a female-biased or equal sex ratio; their densities seasonally increased from 0.17 to 2.02 ind. cm(-2). Female midges produced one to four egg batches totalling on average 247 eggs/female. Four larval stages can be clearly discriminated by head length. Our data on the habitat preferences and the high reproductive output predict that P steinenii will rapidly colonize habitats that become available in the course of the regional warming of the Antarctic Peninsula region.																			0954-1020	1365-2079				JUN	2006	18	2					175	181		10.1017/S0954102006000204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102006000204													WOS:000237899000004

The American Community Survey in counties with "seasonal" populations	POPULATION RESEARCH AND POLICY REVIEW												The U.S. Census Bureau designed the American Community Survey (ACS) to provide annual estimates of social and economic characteristics for states, counties, municipalities, census tracts, and block groups. Because of its April 1 reference date, in northern nonmetropolitan counties with substantial seasonal population fluctuations the decennial census provides a statistical representation of the demographic and social characteristics of the population at a time when the population is close to its annual minimum. The year-round monthly ACS sample survey has the potential to provide local communities with an unprecedented understanding of the average population characteristics over the course of a year. In the future, the ACS even has the potential for providing social and economic characteristics of the population by season. This paper examines four ACS pilot data collection counties, Oneida and Vilas Counties in northern Wisconsin, and Lake and Flathead Counties in northwest Montana. We hypothesize that the ACS will reflect a resident population over the course of the year that is different from the traditional April 1 decennial census population. While the ACS holds much promise, our research uncovered some sampling problems that are not yet fully resolved. In addition, our analysis was not able to examine ACS estimates for minor civil divisions (MCDs), which are functioning governmental units in many states. The fact that these MCDs often have very small populations, together with the fact that estimated standard errors at the much larger census tract level in these counties are disconcertingly large, raises (currently unanswerable) questions concerning the eventual statistical quality of ACS estimates for small MCDs. Consequently, the adequacy of the ACS as a replacement for the census long form may depend on the ability of the Census Bureau to effectively address the concerns presented in this analysis.																			0167-5923	1573-7829				JUN	2006	25	3					275	292		10.1007/s11113-006-0010-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11113-006-0010-6													WOS:000242328100006

J	Whitt, MB; Prince, HH; Cox, RR				Whitt, MB; Prince, HH; Cox, RR			Avian use of purple loosestrife dominated habitat relative to other vegetation types in a Lake Huron wetland complex	WILSON BULLETIN												Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), native to Eurasia, is an introduced perennial plant in North American wetlands that displaces other wetland plants. Although not well studied, purple loosestrife is widely believed to have little value as habitat for birds. To examine the value of purple loosestrife as avian breeding habitat, we conducted early, mid-, and late season bird surveys during two years (1994 and 1995) at 258 18-m (0.1 ha) fixed-radius plots in coastal wetlands of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. We found that loosestrife-dominated habitats had higher avian densities, but lower avian diversities than other vegetation types. The six most commonly observed bird species in all habitats combined were Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), Marsh Wren (C. palustris), Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia), Common Yellowthroat (Geothylpis trichas), Swamp Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), and Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). Swamp Sparrow densities were highest and Marsh Wren densities were lowest in loosestrife dominated habitats. We observed ten breeding species in loosestrife dominated habitats. We conclude that avian use of loosestrife warrants further quantitative investigation because avian use may be higher than is commonly believed.																			0043-5643					MAR	1999	111	1					105	114																WOS:000078936600015

Fluxes were obtained directly using eddy correlation at 12-m altitude, and concentrations were measured sequentially at eight altitudes between 0 and 12 m. A prototype differential infrared absorption methane instrument based on a Zeeman-split HeNe laser was used for determination of methane and a flame ionization detector for total hydrocarbons ( (THE). Methane was found to account for nearly all the THE concentrations and fluxes. Methane fluxes at the tower site were apportioned to various methane-producing habitats, using a satellite image to classify surface vegetation at 20 x 20 m resolution. The "footprint" of the tower was computed using a Gaussian plume model for dispersion in the surface layer. Grid cells classified as dry tundra (water level 5 cm below surface) emitted methane at an average rate of 11+/-3 (standard error) mgCH4/m2/d, and wet meadow tundra (water level near surface) emitted 29+/-3 mgCH4/m2/d. Fluxes from lakes depended on wind speed, averaging 57+/-6 mgCH4/m2/d at the site, where the mean wind speed was 5 m s-1. The mean emission rate for tundra (including lakes) around the tower was 25+/-1 mgCH4/m2/d, notably smaller than adopted for boreal wetlands in recent inventories of global methane sources. Emissions from major habitats derived from the tower measurements were in reasonable agreement with data from chamber studies. Errors of a factor of approximately 2 accrued in scaling up the chamber data, representing 1 m2 plots, to the footprint of the tower measurements (10(3) m), because the satellite could not fully resolve heterogeneous methane-producing habitats. Fluxes obtained at the tower site were in harmony with fluxes from aircraft overflights. The aircraft data represent mainly afternoon periods with good flying weather, conditions associated with maximum CH4 fluxes in the tower time series. Mean fluxes from the aircraft are consequently approximately 2 x higher than seasonal means from the region. Solar irradiance provided the primary control on the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide. The mean maximum uptake near the local solar noon was 1.4+/-0.2 gC/M2/d, and nocturnal respiration averaged 0.73+/-0.18 gC/m2/d. Net uptake of carbon dioxide averaged 0.30 gC/m2/d (0.1 tons C/hectare) during the period of the Arctic Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE 3A). About 6% of the seasonal net uptake was returned to the atmosphere as methane.

NATURAL XENOBIOTICS CHANGE MAJOR LIFE HISTORY TRAITS IN A CLONE OF Daphnia galeata	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												It recently emerged that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with humic substances (HSs) as its major fraction, in concert with increasing temperatures, may reduce zooplankton diversity in freshwater lakes. The mechanisms of this reduction include indirect ones, such as release of reactive oxygen species and their interactions with organisms, as well as direct ones, such as internal xenobiotic action. The latter may lead to changes in the energy allocation and thereby impact population maintenance. In this contribution, we tested a laboratory clone of Daphnia galeata with respect to energy allocation under the challenge by dissolved HSs. The exposure to HSs increased lifespans, but reduced offspring numbers in an almost linear concentration dependency. The most likely mechanism for lifespan extension is mitohormesis, which implies that a certain increase of internal reactive oxygen production leads to improved health and longevity. Direct or indirect nutrition by the exposed HSs is very unlikely to apply. In the protected environment of the applied experimental set-up, the observed energy re-allocation may pose the population at risk, and this clone of D. galeata appears to be a candidate who could suffer from the seasonal variability of DOC in lakes.

The sediments were anthropogenic ally enriched with Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr and classified as uncontaminated to moderately contaminated, with a medium risk of Zn, Co, Ni and Cr, and low risk of Cu, Pb and Cd. Analysis of correlations and PCA showed temporal variations in the concentration of metals in the sediments during the rainy season, and spatial variations, where the depth and anthropogenic inputs are the main variables. The contamination of sediments was located on the axis connecting the mouths of the river Guayos, which crosses the city of Valencia, and the river Guey which crosses the city of Maracay, both highly industrialized. Although the concentration of dissolved heavy metals into the waters was within the regulations, important concentrations of Pb and Hg and the bioaccumulation of Hg and Cr, determined by the Bioconcentration Factor (BCF), were found in the fish tissues which indicate that the metal enrichment of the lake sediments is affecting the biota.

Secchi transparency, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a are surrogate measurements used in the calculation of trophic state indices (TSI) which classify waters as oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic or hypereutrophic. Yet the relationships between these surrogate measurements and direct measures of lake productivity vary regionally and may be influenced by external factors such as non-algal turbidity. Prairie pothole basins, common throughout eastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, are shallow glacial lakes subject to frequent winds and sediment resuspension. Light-dark oxygen bottle methodology was employed to evaluate vertical planktonic production within an eastern South Dakota pothole basin. Secchi transparency, total phosphorus and planktonic chlorophyll a were also measured from each of three basin sites at biweekly intervals throughout the 2012 growing season. Secchi transparencies ranged between 0.13 and 0.25 meters, corresponding to an average TSISD value of 84.4 (hypereutrophy). Total phosphorus concentrations ranged between 178 and 858 ug/L, corresponding to an average TSITP of 86.7 (hypereutrophy). Chlorophyll a values corresponded to an average TSIChla value of 69.4 (transitional between eutrophy and hypereutrophy) and vertical production profiles yielded areal net primary productivity values averaging 288.3 mg C.m(-2).d(-1) (mesotrophy). Our results support the hypothesis that resuspended non-algal turbidity, not planktonic production, decreases water transparency and reduces potential net primary production. Chlorophyll a TSI values corresponded most closely with measurements of planktonic production and better represented the trophic state of this basin.																			0096-378X	0096-1947					2013	92						67	78																WOS:000432620600005

The coring site is a seasonally inundated forest where water availability is directly influenced by precipitation. Diatoms, chrysophyte statospores, sponge remains and phytoliths were counted in 25 samples throughout the core. Based on the relative abundance of diatom species, the record was subdivided into four diatom assemblage zones, which mainly reflect the hydrological state of the study site. An age-depth relationship based on radiocarbon measurements of eight samples reveals a basal age of the core of approximately 2,500 cal. yrs. BP. Two significant changes of diatom assemblage composition were found that could be linked to both, natural and anthropogenic influences. At 700 cal. yrs. BP, the diatom record documents a shift from tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species to epiphytic Eunotia species, indicating a shortening of the hydroperiod, i.e. the time period during which a wetland is covered by water. This transition was interpreted as being triggered by natural climate change.

J	CAPALDO, SD; PETERS, CR				CAPALDO, SD; PETERS, CR			SKELETAL INVENTORIES FROM WILDEBEEST DROWNINGS AT LAKES MASEK AND NDUTU IN THE SERENGETI ECOSYSTEM OF TANZANIA	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Wildebeest drownings produce dense bone deposits over large surface areas adjacent to lakes and rivers in the Serengenti ecosystem of East Africa. Drownings occur during the annual wildebeest migration when animals cross rivers and lakes on their way to wet season pastures. Drownings involve both small and large numbers of adult and newborn wildebeest and can occur in a single event or a sequence of small and large events during the wet season. Signature criteria from surface skeletal remains produced by modern drownings that may, as an integrated set, help to identify them in the fossil record include: (1) the predominance of adults from a single species and the variable representation of newborns and yearlings; (2) the presence of intact elements from all adult skeletal groups; (3) assemblages dominated by axial elements and long bones; and (4) negative correlations between the representation of long bones and their marrow wet weights; assemblages from large drowning events possess weak negative correlations while small events possess strong negative correlations. The application of these criteria requires a landscape sampling strategy, because the drowning event's signature can be spread out over hundreds or thousands of metres of river or lake front. Consequently, localized samples from a large drowning may be affected differently by carnivores, flowing water, trampling, weathering, and/or burial and not possess all of these signature criteria. Drowning represent important scavenging opportunities for a wide variety of consumers because of the number of carcasses they can produce. Their occurrence in rivers and lakes also gives them some seasonal and spatial predictability. Under these circumstances, it is possible that water-restricted early hominids may have gained relatively early access to large animal carcasses without recourse to hunting or confrontational scavenging. Early access to carcasses would have been facilitated by the simultaneous presence of many drowned individuals over a large area, because these conditions act to reduce inter-and intra-specific competition for carcass foods among consumers. Later access to carcasses could still have provided hominids with a wealth of nutritious long bone marrow and cranial contents.																			0305-4403					MAY	1995	22	3					385	408		10.1006/jasc.1995.0039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jasc.1995.0039													WOS:A1995RM66100004

Hydrological characterization and connectivity of proglacial lakes to a stream, Adygine ice-debris complex, northern Tien Shan	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												In this study, we characterized the glacial meltwater flow through a proglacial area with a focus on proglacial lakes, their hydrological regime and their connection to the stream. The studied lakes - the Adygine ice-debris complex, northern Tien Shan - showed a distinct development throughout an ablation season: at Lake 2, the mean daily water-level fluctuation amplitude increased from 0.07 m to 0.18 m (June, August), then dropped to 0.07 m in September. Glacial meltwater flows through the lakes and further downstream through a rock glacier rather fast, moving at 0.085 m s(-1). However, based on the low dye recovery in the stream (0.03%), only a small portion of water was routed efficiently. The complexity of the site's drainage system was supported by varying isotopic composition of water in the tarns situated on the rock glacier, with Tarn a (delta H-2: -36.08 parts per thousand; delta O-18: -6.25 parts per thousand) being the most enriched and Tarn c (delta H-2: 78.68 parts per thousand; delta O-18: 11.9 parts per thousand) the most depleted in heavy isotopes.

J	Costa, ID; Freitas, CED				Costa, Igor David; de Carvalho Freitas, Carlos Edwar			Factors determining the structure of fish assemblages in an Amazonian river near to oil and gas exploration areas in the Amazon basin (Brazil): establishing the baseline for environmental evaluation	ZOOLOGIA												Determining the significance of biotic and abiotic factors in the structuring of fish assemblages in freshwater environments is an important question in ecology, particularly in view of environmental changes caused by man. In this paper we sought to identify the factors responsible for the composition and abundance of fish species collected with gill nets in six locations near ports in forest clearance areas opened up for oil and natural gas exploration (Petrobras Pedro Moura Base) in the Urucu River, during drought and flood cycles. In all, 923 individuals from 23 families and 82 species were collected, totalling a biomass of 182,244 g. The most abundant species during the flood season were Bryconops alburnoides (Kner, 1858) and Dianema urostriatum (Miranda Ribeiro, 1912); in the drought season, the predominant species were Osteoglossum bicirrhosum (Cuvier, 1829) and Serrasalmus rhombeus (Linnaeus, 1766). The species with the greatest biomass during the flood season were Pellona castelnaeana (Valenciennes, 1847), S. rhombeus and Pellona flavipinis (Valenciennes, 1847). During the drought season, the predominant species was O. bicirrhosum. When both periods were analysed together, electrical conductivity, water transparency and dissolved oxygen were the most important factors. The species Hemisorubim platyrhynchos (Valenciennes, 1840), O. bicirrhosum, Chaetobranchus flavenscens Heckel, 1840, Geophagus proximus (Castelnau, 1855) were strongly related to high values of conductivity, pH and water current velocity during the drought season, as well as Serrasalmus altispinis Merckx, Jegu & Santos, 2000, Triportheus albus Cope, 1872, Triportheus angulatus (Spix & Agassiz, 1829) and Brycon melanopterus (Cope, 1872) that were associated with less depth and width in the drought season whereas P. castelnaeana, D. urostriatum, Rhytiodus argenteofuscus Kner, 1858 and Sorubim lima (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) were mainly associated with high transparency and dissolved oxygen during the flood season.

Spatial and Temporal Behavior of Soluble Manganese at the Sediment-Water Interface in the Riogrande II Reservoir in Colombia	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The behavior of manganese (Mn) at the sediment-water interface in bodies of water such as lakes and reservoirs is dependent on physicochemical factors such as pH, redox potential-Eh, organic matter, specific conductance, and the presence of organic and inorganic complexes. These allow the mobilization of Mn from the sediment to the water column and promote its precipitation as Mn oxyhydroxide. For the Riogrande II reservoir in Colombia (2550 m), it was found that redox potential-Eh below +350 mV is not appropriate for oxide stability. The availability and mobility of these oxides are more associated with organic complexation and desorption from sediments when the pH changes from neutral conditions to slightly acidic conditions (6.0). However, when the lower gates of the reservoir are opened during the dry season, the entry of oxygenated bottom currents most likely increases the dissolved oxygen (DO) and redox potential-Eh. Similarly, the increase in soluble Mn at the intake tower during the dry season is more associated with desorption than with reductive dissolution. The primary objective of this study is to determine the main physicochemical factors favoring Mn remobilization from sediment to the water column and its relation to the operating mechanisms of the intake water tower of the Riogrande II reservoir. One of the most notable results of this study is the observation that the operating mechanisms of the Riogrande II reservoir not only affect the type of water that is captured but also influence the geochemical processes at the bottom of the reservoir and in the sediment. The results of this study highlight the influence of hydraulic processes on surface water bodies as regards the dynamics of metal remobilization, the generation of pollution into the water column, and the increasing costs of treatment and purification in reservoirs in high mountain areas in tropical countries.																				1087-3562				OCT	2015	19						1	23		10.1175/EI-D-14-0008.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/EI-D-14-0008.1													WOS:000364236600001

Determining the influence of Itaipu Lake on thermal conditions for soybean development in adjacent lands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Previous numerical simulations have suggested that the area adjacent to Itaipu Lake in Southern Brazil is significantly affecting the local thermal regime through development of a lake breeze. This has led to concerns that soybean growth and development, and consequently yield, has been affected by the creation of the artificial lake in this important agricultural region, but a systematic climatological study of the thermal effects of Itaipu Lake has not been conducted. The objectives of this study were to assess the spatial pattern of minimum and maximum air temperatures in a 10-km-wide area adjacent to Itaipu Lake as affected by distance from the water. Measurements were conducted over 3 years in seven transects along the shore of Itaipu Lake, with five weather stations placed in each transect. Phenological observations in soybean fields surrounding the weather stations were also conducted. Generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) analysis indicated no difference in the temperature time series as distance from water increased. Semivariograms showed that the random components in the air temperature were predominant and that there was no spatial structure to the signal. Wind direction measured over the three growing seasons demonstrated that, on average, the development of a lake breeze is limited to a few locations and a few hours of the day, supporting the temporal and spatial analysis. Phenological observations did not show differences in the timing of critical soybean stages. We suggest that the concerns that soybean development is potentially affected by the presence of Itaipu Lake are not supported by the thermal environment observed.

There was a nearly 1 mgC l(-1) downstream increase in refractory DOC in the lake; at the center it fluctuated little seasonally. The characteristic UV-absorbance: DOC ratios were determined for samples from the influent rivers (pedogenic: used interchangeably with ''allochthonous'') and outdoor experimental ponds (autochthonous) during incubations. These ratios were then used to calculate the proportion of total measured lake water DOC in each of four components: pedogenic-refractory (PR), pedogenic-labile (PR), autochthonous-refractory (AR) and autochthonous-labile (AL). PR was uniform (around 1.5 mgC l(-1)) or diminished very slightly over time. AR increased from nearly zero at the station closest to an influent river to 1 mgC l(-1) at the lake center. PL declined downstream from 0.3 mgC l(-1) to zero. AL was virtually constant at 0.8 mgC l(-1) except at the station closest to the influent river. The constancy of the UV-absorbance: DOC ratio during the biodegradation process was confirmed for Lake Kasumigaura; hence a two-component model (pedogenic-autochthonous) could be applied here without consideration of DOC lability. However, this assumption is not always met for other water bodies, and therefore it should be checked before applying a two-component model elsewhere.

J	SIEVING, KE				SIEVING, KE			NEST PREDATION AND DIFFERENTIAL INSULAR EXTINCTION AMONG SELECTED FOREST BIRDS OF CENTRAL PANAMA	ECOLOGY												Barro Colorado Island (BCI) is a 75-yr-old tropical forest isolate in Gatun Lake in the Republic of Panama, where depredation of understory bird nests is hypothesized to be more intense than in nearby mainland forest. Eight of 12 bird species in the terrestrial insectivore guild, with historical breeding records from BCI, are now extinct on the island. I tested the hypothesis that interspecific variation in nest design and placement underlies differential avian extinction from BCI. Selecting five species from the terrestrial insectivore guild, two that are extinct and three that persist on BCI, I constructed 200 hand-made mimics of their nests (40 each of the five types) using species-specific nest materials collected in local forest. Artificial nests, containing Coturnix quail eggs as bait, were placed on two island and two mainland plots for representative incubation periods (15 d) and checked at 3-d intervals for predation. Experiments were repeated in February, late April, and June of 1988 to assess seasonal shifts in predation pressure in relation to timing of breeding in understory birds, and temporal constancy of interspecific differences in nest loss rates. BCI nest losses were higher than on the mainland in two of the three experiments and predation intensity varied seasonally. Peak losses occurred in April-May (late in the dry season), immediately before the onset of breeding in understory insectivorous birds, suggesting nest predation may influence the timing of nesting activities. Two nest types designed to mimic the nests of species now extinct from BCI suffered lower predation on BCI and on the mainland than three nest types of species persisting on BCI. However, ratios of island to mainland predation rates were disproportionately higher for BCI-extinct nest types than for BCI-persistent nests in two of the three samples. Results suggest that over evolutionary time species-specific rates of nest loss may determine clutch replacement capability, thereby causing variation in tolerance of inflated insular nest predation. In this way, interspecific variation in nest design and placement among terrestrial insectivorous birds may underlie the pattern of differential extinction from Barro Colorado Island.

The fluviodynamic character of the sites initially colonized by plants was studied along different river types. and this information was combined with botanical observations from the same areas. Special emphasis was given to colonizing plant distribution and survival in relation to the abiotic environment. (2) Four frequently occurring landform types. each rich in microforms. were recognized in relation to the colonization process: fluvial bars, swales, abandoned channels and riverbanks. They are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the rivers and tend to be narrow, curved or linear patches. Local site and colonizing vegetation characteristics vary considerably between different river types (meandering or braided, rich or poor in suspended sediment). (3) The newly deposited fluvial sediments are poor in organic carbon and nitrogen. Colonization begins either with immigrant propagules dispersed by wind or water, or with the invasion of species by vegetative means. Usually numbers of individuals are few, and the initial vegetation pattern is a reflection of the small-scale mosaic of microsites. The pioneer flora (125 species recorded) includes many widespread perennial herbs, and seeds of most forest species do not germinate in the dry sediments. Herbaceous colonist species are almost non-existent in suspension-poor rivers of low erosion rate. (4) The persistence of the initial plant assemblage is controlled by the evolution of fluvial landforms. Only a few species among the set of colonists are significant in later forest succession. These include Tessaria integrifolia and Gynerium sagittatum, which resist moderate flood damage and resprout after burial. Mature seed populations of these 10- 15-m-tall species are abundant at the outermost margin of the successional forest just beyond the fluvial bars. The low representation of tree species in the colonizing phase suggests that the extreme environmental conditions at the river margins differ from other natural environments along the Amazon. (5) Aquatic succession on lakes affected by suspension-rich waters starts with genuine floating species. The general habits of these vegetation assemblages and their species composition are highly similar in the 'white-water' floodplains of the study area. An annual vegetation flush characteristically follows the flood period. On the other hand, macrophyte vegetation is almost non-existent on the floodplain lakes of suspension-poor rivers. (6) The Amazon floodplain corridors provide a good opportunity for ecological studies of plant colonization because basically similar succession is present at each meander along the rivers. Furthermore, the basic physiographic processes which form the sites and control their further evolution are both well known and measurable.																			0022-0477					DEC	1991	79	4					877	901		10.2307/2261087	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2261087													WOS:A1991HQ47400001

Many species are known to be of potential value and use for animal grazing. Eight common species were collected from different parts of Wadi Allaqi in order to evaluate their nutritional status and identify the potential suitability of these species for grazing. Plant samples were analysed for P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, crude protein, carbohydrates, fibres, fats and secondary products. The results showed that Tamarix nilotica, which forms the major source of livestock grazing due to its dominance around the lake, has a high protein and carbohydrate content and is also a salt accumulator. Astragalus vogelii provides a good source of livestock grazing due to its nutrition value, but only for the short period following the seasonal rain event, while the good quality grazing period of Psoralea plicata was much longer. The grasses, such as Eragrostis aegyptiaca, Fimbristylis bisumbellata, and Crypsis schoenoides, represent the main source of grazing for livestock on the shores of Lake Nasser after the inundation of water. Citrullus colocynthis and Euphorbia granulata are common species all over the wadi and are only grazed by gazelle.

The fractions were (1) exchangeable and bound to carbonate, (2) bound to Fe/Mn oxide, (3) bound to organic matter and sulfide, and (4) acid soluble. These fractions have the advantage of providing better insight into the mechanism of association of metals with mineralogical phases of the sediments. Samples were taken in three seasons and the average concentration of the elements was calculated. Based on the results determined at 15 sampling points along the lake, it seems that Lake Balaton has not yet been polluted. Concentrations of species were below the Hungarian standard levels set for soils, and most of the elements were found in the acid-soluble fraction, indicating stable compounds in sediments. There were no significant changes in the individual seasonal concentrations of elements in this short monitoring period. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

Although eutrophication is a natural process in the aging of lakes and estuaries, human activities are greatly accelerating this phenomenon by increasing the rate at which nutrients and organic substances enter aquatic ecosystems from their surrounding watersheds. Despite there is a fundamental understanding of the processes that cause eutrophication we still need to develop new methods and indicators and improve others to detect incipient eutrophication in ecosystems, providing information before major changes in species composition and abundance take place. The need of reliable indicators that correlate estuarine changes with human pressures over time (urban, industrial, and agriculture) is essential to understand their dynamics and to ensure effective management of these ecosystems. This chapter aims to evaluate the relative utility of rooted macrophytes and chemical variables in assessing eutrophication of two Portuguese estuaries subjected to different degrees of anthropogenic inputs owing to varied human activities and soil uses on their watersheds. We also document nitrogen deposition history in each estuary.

Catfish were first propagated in state fish hatcheries and stocked in public and private waters in 1911. The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) began intensive rearing of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus in 1938. Since 1942, fingerling channel catfish have been used in MDC's private impoundment stocking program. In the early 1960s, MDC initiated production of advanced fingerling channel catfish (>20.3 cm) for stocking in small public lakes. Catchable-size channel catfish (>30.5 cm) are provided for kids' fishing clinics and the urban fishing program where angler effort is as high as 30,000 h/ha. Blue catfish I. furcatus and flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris were first reared for stocking in public impoundments in 1978 and 1983, respectively. Commercial markets currently exist for channel catfish, flathead catfish, and blue catfish harvested from the Mississippi and St. Francis rivers. Catfish have comprised 21% of the commercial fish harvest since commercial fishing reports became a requirement in 1945. Channel catfish aquaculture has been a viable commercial industry in Missouri since the 1950s. The first official state sportfishing regulation established for catfish was a seasonal restriction in 1928 followed by a 30.5-cm minimum length limit for channel catfish in 1933. Separate daily sport fish bag limits are in effect for flathead catfish, blue catfish, and channel catfish. Currently, catfish are the most preferred sport fish group in Missouri. Most (75%) catfish anglers prefer to fish for channel catfish, most are harvest-oriented, and more than 80% prefer to fish with rod and reel. Competitive fishing for catfish began in the early 1980s, with most tournaments held on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and associated lower tributary streams. Major management achievements include banning commercial catfishing on the Missouri River and developing an effective sampling technique for monitoring channel catfish populations in small public lakes. Current fisheries management efforts are directed by a statewide plan and primarily focused on measuring exploitation, growth, movement, and fecundity of blue catfish and flathead catfish in the Missouri River, upper Mississippi River, and associated tributaries, and growth and exploitation of blue catfish and flathead catfish in two large reservoirs.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-25-7				2011	77						55	70																WOS:000393725100005

There were significant differences between low and high biomass seasons for the investigated parameters' values. Considering the important role of phytoplankton dynamics and hydro-morphological factors, the analysis showed that: phytoplankton, wind disturbance, and organic matter may be the main factors affecting the water quality of Dongqian Lake; the growth of phytoplankton led to P release from the sediment, but not N release, lowering the TN:TP ratio; the growth of phytoplankton increased TP, particulate phosphorus, dissolved organic phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, and suspended solids phosphorus concentration in the water column, accounting for 56.8%, 41.6%, 22.0%, 13.3%, 48.3% of their variations, respectively; phytoplankton may be a source of non-reactive NaOH-extractable phosphorus and other organic phosphorus in the sediment, and influenced the vertical distribution of phosphorus. The horizontal distribution of phosphorus fractions in the sediment also appear to be influenced by the wind direction.					jing, liandong/AAO-2364-2021														1018-4619	1610-2304					2011	20	11A					3014	3024																WOS:000298067200007

Thirty sediment samples were collected from 10 localities in the Cuitzeo Lake during 3 different field campaigns. The metal content in the sediments show slight variations during different annual seasons but not in different sites of sampling. Samples collected at the mouth of the Grande River show high contents of Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, V and Zn. This increase is especially evident during the dry season when concentration levels of Cu and Pb exceeded the accepted Guidelines provided by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. Pearson correlation analysis suggested a common source for Cu, Pb and Zn, and all other analyzed metals are not correlated. This quality monitoring from Cuitzeo Lake will provide a data basis for a regular monitoring program, to implement suitable pollution control measurements and, therefore, possible methods of remediation.

J	Özyavuz, M				Ozyavuz, Murat			Determination of Temporal Changes in Lakes Mert and Erikli Using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Igneada area of Turkey includes different ecosystems and a wide range of biodiversity, making it one of Turkey's most important areas. Igneada and the surrounding environment have unique characteristics; in other parts of Turkey and Europe, the types of wild forests found in the Igneada area have been damaged by anthropogenic effects. Lakes Mert and Erikli in the Igneada area play an important role in the formation and maintenance of the Longos forest. This study used Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1987 and 2009 and 1:25,000-scale topographic maps. The satellite images were geometrically corrected and underwent image processing and classification, and the results were subsequently calculated using reclassification and overlay analyses. In addition, a rapid ecological assessment was carried out to detect changes in the field. The surfaces of lakes Mert and Erikli were found to have decreased by 4.03%. The reason for this minor change is that the flow rates of streams feeding these lakes are well protected. The primary cause of the observed changes was found to be the amount of seasonal precipitation and the amount of water taken from the rivers feeding these lakes.

The water sampling points were set up on the main stream and tributary on Lean River, and water samples were taken in wet season, dry season, normal season and in the agricultural busy season; the chemical analysis has been carried out in the laboratory. The results indicate that the peak concentration of total nitrogen (TN), dissolved nitrogen (DTN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) appear in December, and the lowest concentration in September, while the concentration of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) follows converse trend, it is highest in wet season, and lowest in dry season. Furthermore, the concentration of diffuse N is generally higher in downstream area compared to upstream area, and it increased dramatically after rainstorm and intensive agriculture activities. The main finding of this work is that rainfall and runoff are the primary driving factors to cause non-point source N exported from the catchment. Meanwhile fertilizer application causes a great quantity of N into environment, and agricultural activities accelerate the N transformation to water bodies. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This question has been discussed for many years. For the most periphery borderline of the water just close to the first and secondary dikes around the lake during flood period, therefore, these dikes were chosen as research targets. Visual interpretation by using of ETM+ images acquired in September 2001 to get information of these targets closest to the water surface. However, in inner region of these dikes surrounded, some islands and key dikes cannot be submerged by flood should be removed in DTL area measurement, and the result the area is 2713.855 km2. Compare with previous researches, which show differences and limitations in different methods. The new area value obtained from this study is the largest water surface can reach in flood season of DTL without any dike broken, which can provide a scientific decision-making basis for sustainable development of DTL wetlands.

J	Weliange, WS; Amarasinghe, US				Weliange, WS; Amarasinghe, US			Seasonality in dietary shifts in size-structured freshwater fish assemblages in three reservoirs of Sri Lanka	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We studied seasonal changes in feeding habits of size-structured fish assemblages in three freshwater reservoirs in Sri Lanka. We obtained fish samples for diet analysis from three reservoirs during the months of rising water level (RIWL) and receding water level (REWL). During RIWL, peripheral areas with terrestrial/semi-terrestrial macrophytes get inundated, which resulted in increased food availability for macrophyte feeding fish. During REWL, detrital food sources increase due to decaying terrestrial plant material, which has inundated. Based on the dietary habits of individual species in the three reservoirs during RIWL and REWL, it is evident that detritivorous and phytoplanktivorous fish species, which belong to low trophic levels do not show significant variation in dietary habits between the two seasons (e.g. Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis niloticus and Amblypharyngodon melettinus). Stenophagous species such as benthic invertebrate predators (Puntius chola and Puntius dorsalis), macrophytophagous species (Etroplus suratensis and Tilapia rendalli) and zooplanktivorous Hemirhamphus limbatus do not exhibit significant variation in dietary habits between seasons. Also their feeding habits do not vary with body size. Euryphagous species such as Puntius filamentosus on the other hand, exhibit variations in dietary habits between seasons as well as with body size. Stenophagous species, which feed on detritus and phytoplankton and euryphagous species, which exhibit temporal dietary plasticity, are therefore abundant in fish assemblages of these reservoirs.

J	Lal, R				Lal, R			Axle load and tillage effects on crop yields on a Mollic Ochraqualf in Northwest Ohio	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Effects of axle load and tillage methods were studied for four crops grown on a clayey soil in the lake-bed region of northwestern Ohio for 7 consecutive years from 1988 to 1991. Three tillage methods were no-till (NT), chisel plough (CP) and mouldboard ploughing (MP). Split-plot axle load treatments were control, 10 Mg axle load and 20 Mg axle load. Axle load was created using a single axle grain cart either half full (10 Mg) or full (20 Mg). Maize (2ea mays), soybeans (Glycine max), oats (Avena sativa), and sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris) were grown in 3-year or 2-year rotation sequences. Axle load treatments had a significant effect on crop yield. Considering average yield for the 3-year rotation over all tillage treatments and 7 seasons, mean maize yield was 7.2 Mg ha(-1) for control, 6.0 Mg ha(-1) for 10 Mg axle load, and 5.4 Mg ha(-1) for 20 Mg axle load. Mean maize yield in 2-year rotation was 7.1 Mg ha(-1) for control, 6.1 Mg ha(-1) for 10 Mg axle load, and 5.4 Mg ha(-1) for 20 Mg axle load. Soybean grain yield in the 2-year rotation was 2.4 Mg ha(-1) for control, 2.2 Mg ha(-1) for 10 Mg axle load, and 1.9 Mg ha(-1) for 20 Mg axle load. Mean soybean grain yield for the 2-year rotation was 2.6 Mg ha(-1) for control, 2.0 Mg ha(-1) for 10 Mg axle load, and 1.6 Mg ha(-1) for 20 Mg axle load. Mean oat grain yield, based on the average of all tillage treatments over the 7 seasons, was 2.6 Mg ha(-1) for control, 2.1 Mg ha(-1) for 10 Mg axle load, and 1.8 Mg ha(-1) for 20 Mg axle load. Crop yield was also affected by the tillage treatments. Mean maize grain yield was 5.8 Mg ha(-1) for NT, 6.5 Mg ha(-1) for CP, and 6.3 Mg ha(-1) for MP in the 3-year rotation compared with 6.4 Mg ha(-1) for NT, 6.0 Mg ha(-1) for CP, and 6.1 Mg ha(-1) for MP method in the 2-year rotation. The average soybean yield in 3-year rotation was 2.1 Mg ha(-1) for NT, 2.1 Mg ha(-1) for CP, and 2.2 Mg ha(-1) for MP methods. Mean oat grain yield was 2.3 Mg ha(-1) for NT, 2.3 Mg ha(-1) for CP, and 2.0 Mg ha(-1) for MP method. Tillage methods had no significant effect on sugarbeet yield, which was 10.8 Mg ha(-1) for NT, 16.0 Mg ha(-1) for CP, and 14.0 Mg ha(-1) for MP methods.

J	Weiher, E; Wisheu, IC; Keddy, PA; Moore, DRJ				Weiher, E; Wisheu, IC; Keddy, PA; Moore, DRJ			Establishment, persistence, and management implications of experimental wetland plant communities	WETLANDS												We inoculated 120 wetland microcosms representing 24 different environmental treatments with seeds from a carefully chosen pool of 20 wetland plant species. The treatments were chosen to represent a variety of riverine and lacustrine wetlands, including those with slow-growing, rare species. In the first season, an annual (Bidens cernua) was most abundant in all the microcosms. Both flooding and high fertility negatively effected the other species establishment. Short-term information about establishment was not predictive of longer-term trends. After 5 years, most of the microcosms became dominated by Lythrum salicaria and, when this occurred, other dicot species were extirpated. After 5 years, flooding and fertility remained the main factors affecting species composition in the microcosms. Lythrum establishment (and dominance) was minimal when fertility was low and when the microcosms were seasonally hooded. Establishment and growth of Typha angustifolia was poor, and this was attributed to coarse substrate. These results suggest possible measures to minimize the growth of unwanted plant species in created or restored wetlands. Our results also suggest that high diversity, low biomass wetlands will be difficult to create; therefore, protection of such wetlands may deserve a higher priority.

Small HNF (<8 mu m) were the most important bacterial grazers, accounting, on average, for 80 % of the total grazing on bacteria, whereas abundance and production of HNF were controlled by ciliate grazing, Bacterivorous protozoa stimulated bacterial growth and contributed to an enhanced turnover of bacterial biomass. About 20% of annual bacterial production was channelled through the microbial loop. However, bacterial carbon flux through the microbial loop showed marked seasonal oscillations with considerably higher values recorded during the warmer part of the year (June to November). Thus, in that period the microbial loop could be an important Link between primary production and higher trophic levels. Grazing rates obtained by an RLB (radioactive-labelled bacteria) method were regularly higher than values obtained by the size fractionation method.																			0171-8630	1616-1599				NOV	1994	114	3					219	235		10.3354/meps114219	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps114219													WOS:A1994PW88800002

Samples were collected at different depths from November 1992 to October 1993. The phosphatase activities were measured spectrophotometrically with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate and related to protein concentrations. No correlations were found between APA and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations during an annual cycle. Free phosphatases were particularly high in the epilimnion (54.5% of total activity was at 5 m) and decreased with depth (4% of total APA at 40 m). The contribution of small microorganisms to APA increased with depth. It was concluded that APA is not a valid quantitative test of the phosphorus status of aquatic microorganisms.

Concentrations of trace elements and organic contaminants in air over the rural Chesapeake Bay were similar at the three sites, and annual averages were influenced by occasional spikes in concentration at each of the sites. Although the highest concentrations in rainwater coincided with small precipitation events, monthly wet depositional fluxes of trace elements and organic contaminants did not significantly vary with season. Concentrations and fluxes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) appeared to decrease between 1990 and 1993, while those of most trace elements remained relatively constant. Concentrations of organic contaminants in rainwater in the Chesapeake Bay region are lower that comparable measurements in the Great Lakes, despite higher atmospheric inventories. Estimates of total atmospheric deposition are within a factor of two between the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes, suggesting that both regions share a common "regional background" atmospheric deposition signal. The potential for elevated deposition near urban areas is not considered in this comparison. Comparing the magnitude of atmospheric deposition relative to other possible sources of trace elements and organic contaminants to the Chesapeake Bay is complicated both by inconsistencies in the methods and study periods and by fundamental differences in the speciation and geochemical reactivity of materials carried by each source. Atmospheric deposition directly to the surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay supplies loads of PAHs which are comparable to or greater than the loads of dissolved PAHs delivered by the Susquehanna River. In contrast, dissolved total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) loads from the river are approximately three times those from the atmosphere. Particulate-bound organic contaminants discharged from the Susquehanna River are considerably larger, especially during high flows. Atmospheric depositional fluxes of several elements, including lead, cadmium, and chromium, are within a factor of two of the dissolved load from the Susquehanna River. Again, particulate metal loads from the river dominate over both dissolved riverine loads and atmospheric deposition.

RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ABSORBED DOSE OF IONIZING RADIATION FOR HELOPHYTES IN THE WATER BODIES OF THE NEAR EMERGENCY ZONE AT THE CHORNOBYL NPP	NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND ATOMIC ENERGY												Based on modeling the dynamics of the Chornobyl emission radionuclide content in the components of the most polluted reservoirs of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, the absorbed dose for helophytes was reconstructed. During the growing season of 1986, the absorbed dose of plants of Glyboke Lake was 78 Gy, Daleke Lake 39 Gy. The absorbed dose rate of plant roots was 2.4 times higher than that of aboveground organs. According to actual data, in the period 2016 - 2019 in the Glyboke Lake average dose of external and internal plant irradiation was about 7.5 mGy/year, and in the Daleke Lake 5.6 mGy/year. On abnormally contaminated sections of the Glyboke Lake, the external dose reaches 0.5 - 1.0 Gy/year. During the period 1986 - 2020, the maximum cumulative (biological) dose of helophytes of Glyboke Lake can be 190 Gy, Daleke Lake 80 - 85 Gy.

HYDROCHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS IN ICE WEDGE OF THE KARA REGION CRYOLITOZONE KEY AREAS	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												Relevance of the research. Information on composition, ice content and geochemical characteristics of frozen rocks is necessary for exploration of oil and gas condensate fields of Yamal, Gydan and Taimyr. Among the factors determining the tundra landscapes ecology of the cryolithozone, underground ice and their melting have great importance. The hydrochemical composition and rare-earth elements content in syngenetic ice wedge retain the information on the moisture sources and conditions of their formation. The main ions correlation and rare-earth elements distribution in the ice composition can be used to estimate the influence of such natural factors as precipitation, sea and volcanic aerosols and anthropogenic pollution. The main aim of the research is to identify chemical elements sources and to assess the impact of the ice type on hydrochemical composition and rare-earth elements distribution in different genetic types of ice - wedge, seasonal and firn ice. Objects: ice wedge, sediments rocks, seasonal ice, surface water, taken in expeditions Earth Cryosphere Institute, Tyumen scientific centre SB RAS in 2009-2014. Methods of chemical research: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectrometry, emission photometry, chromatography. Results. It is established that marine and continental aerosols influenced the chemical composition of ice wedge studied in the coastal zone of the key areas of Belyj island, Sibiryakova island, Western Yamal and Western Taimyr. Fresh and ultrafresh syngenetic ice wedge is formed by freezing melt water, which contains snow-sorbed sea aerosols - suspended in the atmosphere solid and liquid particles. Ice wedge in the lake Sokhonto area long-distanced from the sea has no signs of marine influence according to the main ions content. Ice wedge with mineral inclusions was formed not only due to snow melt water with aerosols of continental origin, but also due to the suprapermafrost water. It was found out that lanthanide content in water-soluble form has increased in comparison with both clark values and the content in the modern surface ice. In the most of examined syngenetic ice wedge the participation of marine aerosols is confirmed taking into account the cerium anomaly. Moreover according to the distribution of rare-earth elements the correlation between light and heavy rare-earth elements typical for ice wedge, equal to 0,9, and correlation between lanthanum and the other lanthanides, equal to 0,2, are observed. Sea ice inherits the mineralization and composition of sea water. Lake ice varies in depth and reflects seasonal changes in hydrochemical composition of ice and increases in concentration of marine aerosols in the snow covering the lake ice. Firn ice of the polar Urals has a very low mineralization, there are no impurities of sea aerosol. The natural mechanism of rare earth elements accumulation in water-soluble form in combination with iron, thorium and yttrium is implemented in ice wedge of the Holocene and Neopleistocene. Melting out ice wedge may lead to the flow of rare-earth elements in the surface water.

Automatic sensors, allowing for continuous monitoring of various water quality variables at high temporal resolution, offer new opportunities for enhancement of essential water quality data. This study investigates the potential of sensor-measured data to improve understanding and management of water quality at watershed level. Self-organizing data maps, non-linear canonical correlation analysis, and linear regressions are used to assess the relationships between multiple water quality and hydroclimatic variables for the case study of Lake Malaren in Sweden, and its total catchment and various watersheds. The results indicate water discharge from dominant watersheds into a lake, and lake water temperature as possible proxies for some key water quality variables in the lake, such as blue-green algae; the latter is, in turn, identified as a potential good proxy for lake concentration of total nitrogen. The relationships between water discharges into the lake and lake water quality dynamics identify the dominant contributing watersheds for different water quality variables. Seasonality also plays an important role in determining some possible proxy relationships and their usefulness for different parts of the year.

In order to evaluate the influences of the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on the diversion of the three outlets, this paper investigates systematically the variation process of the runoff at the three outlets based on substantially raw data and principles of variable control. By using comparative analysis and the calculation method of runoff reduction, the change magnitude of the runoff at the three outlets in different periods were quantified and the contribution rates of different influencing factors were estimated. Results show that (1) Inflow difference from the Yangtze River is the primary factor causing the runoff reduction of the three outlets. After the operation of TGR, the Yangtze River was in dry years. Therefore, over 60% of runoff reduction can be attributed to the variation of natural inflow discharge. (2) As the flow is retained by TGR, the runoff of the three outlets further reduced. From 2003-2008, the contribution rates of natural flow, sediment trapping and reservoir regulation to the runoff reduction at the three outlets were 76.19%, 13.49%, 10.32%, while their counterparts after optimal operation of TGR became 66.05%, 14.20% and 19.75% respectively. (3) Reservoir operation after the flood season showed the most significant impact on runoff of the three outlets, resulting in an increase in the number of shut-off days of the three-distributary channels from September to October, especially at Shadaoguan and Kangjiagang.																			1755-1307						2020	612								012004	10.1088/1755-1315/612/1/012004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/612/1/012004													WOS:000646217700004

It is required to evaluate its water quality for sustainable surface water management. The European Commission Water Framework Directive (WFD) was constructed to monitor water quality for rivers, lakes and transitional and coastal waters utilizing networks. Countries evaluated the Water Framework Directive and principles of WFD have been adapted to the legislation of the country over the past eighteen years. Therefore, this study was conducted in Buyuk Menderes River Basin to determine its water quality classes according to the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs' Regulation (WAR) for Management of Surface Water. Seasonal samples were collected from 39 surveillance monitoring stations. The parameters monitored stated in the regulation were physical ones as temperature, pH, COD and BOD, nutrient parameters, etc. Annual averages of the monitored physico-chemical pollution parameters were used to determine the water quality classes of stations and the whole river basin. The results indicated that the water quality of Buyuk Menderes River Basin was either class III or class IV. Besides, the water quality of Buyuk Menderes River Basin was presented based on Water Framework Directive. So, two regulations (WAR and WFD) were compared with each other according to water quality classification.

The current state of study of the water balance of the lake and the factors that form it are estimated. The main trends for changes in the levels and regime of surface water, groundwater and artesian water in the territory of the Shatsk National Nature Park are identified. Quantitative data characterizing long-term and modern changes in water levels in the lake arc presented. Shallowing of 2019 is characterized (the lowest water level over the last 50 years, reduction of the water mirror area by 8%). Based on statistical mathematical and cartographic analysis of climatic data provided by 17 meteorological stations in the region the dynamics of average annual, monthly and seasonal precipitation, evaporation and their spatial distribution were estimated. A significant increase in evaporation during the warm period of the year over the last decades (2000-2018) has been revealed. Changes in the amount and mode of precipitation over 2 long-term periods are estimated. The peculiarities of the dynamics of the main meteorological indicators in 2019 (average monthly and average annual air temperatures, relative humidity, precipitation amounts) were separately analyzed. Values of humidity coefficients and hydrothermal coefficients were calculated. The parts of the region with the lowest values of these indicators, including the catchment area of Lake Svityaz, are outlined and visualized on the map. The significant role of evaporation growth was confirmed given the consistent increase in air temperatures over the last 20 years. Given the Svityaz station data it is also calculated the correlation coefficients of water levels in the lake with the same indicators for the period since 1970. During the period of 2000-2018, a significant increase in the dependence of water levels on the hydrothermal coefficient of Selyaninov was established, which may indicate a decrease in the ecological stability of the lake and its increasing vulnerability to climate change.

This national park is an unique freshwater fish habitat formed by flat basin or floodplain with fluctuated water level throughout the year in response to rainfall and supply of water from the Kapuas River system. This study aims at describing the fish diversity variation in the LSNP caught using gill nets during high water period (rainy season) in March, June, October 2013, and June 2014 and during low water period (dry season) in March 2014. Samples were taken in three locations, i.e. River Tawang (outlet), Lake Pengembung, and Lake Belida. Six orders, 15 families, and 39 fish species were found. The total number of species found during the low water depth period was less (20 species) than that during high water depth period (32 species). 'Flood-pulse' cycle and the corresponding rise and drop of water level in the floodplain area, sustained by aquatic productivity and habitat diversity, are considered to be the responsible hydrologically controlled seasonal variation in the study area.

Fatty acid composition of tench (Tinca tinca L., 1758): A seasonal differentiation	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Seasonal variations of proximate compositions and fatty acids of tench (Tinca tinca) captured from Seyhan Dam Lake were investigated. The results showed that seasonal fatty acid compositions of tench fillets in July, August and November ranged from 29.59% to 33.71% for saturated fatty acids (SFA), from 20.50% to 21.69% for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and from 26.50% to 41.85% for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Lipid contents of tench fillets in all seasons were statistically different (p<0.05). The major fatty acids of tench sampled in different seasons were palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1 omega 7), oleic acid (18:1 omega 9), linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 omega 6), arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4 omega 6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 omega 3). The proportions of DHA ranged from 5.51% to 17.33%. DHA+EPA compositions of tench fillets were in the highest level of 22.47% in November. The highest ARA content was determined in November at 10.88%. The results showed that tench is a good protein and fatty acid source in human nutrition.

The residential centre established on an island was one of the central points in the state of the first Piasts. Previous research located two bridges to the island and discovered the largest collection of early medieval military objects in Central Europe in the lake. In the 2017 season, a third bridge was discovered on Lake Lednica leading to the small island called Ledniczka on which the layers of an early medieval settlement and clear remnants of a motte-type medieval structure are found. Three seasons of research on relics of the crossing suggest that it may have functioned in two periods: in the tenth century and at the turn of the fourteenth century. During the research, a number of military items, pottery, objects made of organic materials and fishing tools were found.																			0323-1267						2020	72	3					450	469		10.35686/AR.2020.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.35686/AR.2020.16													WOS:000599847200005

As accumulators of water and heat, some of their thermal characteristics might be altered by long term (decadal) hydrometeorological changes and thus may be used as indicators of the effects of global change on fluvial ecosystems. This work focuses on the effect of global change (climate change plus water quantity and land use changes) in the internal organization of Sanabria Lake, specifically in its thermal annual cycle. The existence of temporal trends in the thermal behaviour of the lake was investigated based on the water temperature profiles that are available since 1986. Data analyses include the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test and the Sen slope estimate to evaluate long term and seasonal patterns of hydrometeorological and in-lake thermal variables. The main results surprisingly point to a net lake cooling that could be explained by a stronger thermocline and a weaker vertical transfer of heat to the hypolimnion during the stratification period. These results contribute to understand and quantify the effects of global change on Iberian freshwater bodies.

Investigation of water quality in wet and dry seasons under climate change	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Background: Providing fresh water suitable for drinking and farming and living organisms in the ecosystem is essential. To evaluate water quality, qualitative indicators are often employed for managing water resources and water quality protection and pollution abatement. Aim: This study evaluated the quality of Borkhar basin water resources using three different water quality indices, including National Institutes of Health Water Quality Index (NIHWQI) having nine parameters, the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) having eight parameters, and the Canadian Water Quality Indices (CWQI) with 22 main parameters. Material and methods: Using data for a period of 30 years, NIHWQI, OWQI and CWQI were used. To analyze water quality of the entire basin for current and future time New findings: Results showed that water quality of the basin was in a very moderate range according to NSFWQI, and was in a very bad range accordingly to OWQI. Water quality forecasts showed that future water quality would be bad, based on OWQI and moderate based on NSFWQI, whereas based on CWQI, it will be good for drinking, and bad for aquatic animals, recreation, irrigation, and livestock use.

Phytoplankton of the delta of the Mekong River during the dry season	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												Human activity has disturbed the functioning of river ecosystems all around the globe. The current global climatic fluctuations and local anthropogenic impact lead to rearrangement in the structure and functioning of aquatic communities. One of the most important components of aquatic ecosystems is phytoplankton as the main primary producer of the organic matter, the basis for trophic relations and indicator of changes in the environment. This article presents the first results of a study concerning the peculiarities of quantitative distribution of biomass and species composition of phytoplankton in the delta of the Mekong River at the beginning of the dry season (December of 2018). Diatoms dominated according to biomass practically in all the stations of selection of samples. The total biomass of phytoplankton on average accounted for 0.049 +/- 0.007 mg/L at the abundance of 40 +/- 7 10(3) ind./L. In practically all the studied plots, according to biomass, the dominating diatoms were first of all Aulacoseira granulata, A. islandica, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Cyclotella spp., and Oxyneis binalis. Among Chlorophyta, most often we found Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus quadricauda, but their biomass was insignificant. We determined statistically significant correlation relationships between biomass of phytoplankton and hydrological parameters. Based on the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, we determined negative relations between the total biomass of phytoplankton with salinity and pH. Positive correlation was seen between the biomass of diatoms and turbidity, and also between the temperature and the biomass of chlorophytes and Dinophyta. The biomass of golden algae (Chrysophyceae) and Dinophyta positively correlated with the mineralization. Quantitative regression analysis confirmed the close relationship between the total biomass of phytoplankton, hydrophysical and hydrochemical parameters. Besides the importance of scientific data on biological diversity and ecology of plankton algae, the results we obtained are necessary for organizing biological monitoring in the delta of the Mekong River in the future.

As a consequence, the unique biodiversity and primary production within the lagoon decreased, while eutrophication and siltation increased. As a counter-initiative it was decided to artificially open the lake to the sea by dredging. To help trace and quantify the anthropologic effects on Chilika Lake, a combined sedimentologic, chemical, and isotopic study of the lagoon and its sediments is in progress. The results from two campaigns during the monsoon and consecutive dry season suggest that the large gradients in salinity, sediment and nutrient inputs, as well as primary productivity within the lagoon are controlled by variable fluxes of water, sediment, and nutrients from the three separate catchments to the lagoon. Trends in changes of salinity, H- and O-isotope compositions of waters, but also of concentrations and Cand/or N-isotope compositions of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), particulate organic matter (POM), and aquatic plants indicate that mixing in the lagoon occurs between new freshwater inputs and evaporated water within the basin itself. Except for the outer channel, mixing with seawater is limited. In contrast, the C-isotope compositions of the organic matter in the sediments support a higher overall proportion of "marine" or estuarine POM during the past. The latter may be important during the dry season, coupling salinity increase to the changes in DIC and POM carbon isotope compositions. The salinity, DIC, H-, O-, and C-isotope compositions of water are compatible with evaporation as the main driver for a salinity increase, rather than admixtures with seawater.

Many experimental studies have analysed the feedine behaviour of some calanoid and cyclopoid copepod species on different rotifer prey type's. However. considerations of the impact of predation by these invertebrates on rotifer Populations have generally neglected possible additional effects of this predation through differential predation mortality between eggs, egg-bearing females and females without eggs. The present study used direct observations to describe the predatory effect of two freshwater copepod species, Lovenula alluaudi (Calanoida) and Acanthocyclops vernalis (Cyclopoida), oil egg-bearing females of the rotifer Keratella cochlearis. Both copepod species ingested Keratella eggs and egg-bearing, females. i.e. the female plus its egg. However, in the case of the calanoid copepod, there was a significantly greater probability Of Suppression of Keratella eggs after capture, including direct predation and separation of the eggs from their mothers, than of Keratella females plus attached eggs. In contrast, the probability of suppression of Keratella eggs by the cyclopoid copepod did not significantly differ from that of whole Keratella females. These results are discussed in terms of the impact of this predation pattern oil the fecundity of K. cochlearis populations in natural ecosystems. Rotifer reproduction may be regulated not only by food availability but also by copepod predation.

Thus, historically, wiregrass played a key role in many longleaf communities where it significantly influenced the natural fire regime and thereby the composition of the plant community. Reestablishment of wiregrass is, therefore, critical to restoring the native understory of Atlantic Coastal Plain longleaf pine ecosystems. This study measured the effects of different site preparations and fertilizer application on the survival and growth of wiregrass seedlings. Two-month-old seedlings were underplanted in existing longleaf pine stands on dry Lakeland soils at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Survival was acceptable at 51% after four years, although reduced owing to drought and small seedling size. Survival and growth could both be increased by using older seedlings with an initial height of at least 6 cm. Wiregrass leaves grew quite rapidly and attained an average length of 48 cm in four years on control plots. Basal area growth rate was greater than expected, averaging 40% on control treatments and 55% on cultivated and fertilized plots. If growth rates during the first four seasons continue, wiregrass will attain mature size on cultivated and fertilized plots at six years, while non-fertilized control plots will take eight years. A planting density of one seedling per m(2) is recommended to provide sufficient wiregrass foliar cover to influence fire regimes in a reasonable length of time (i.e., 5-7 years).																			1061-2971					SEP	1999	7	3					262	270		10.1046/j.1526-100X.1999.72019.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100X.1999.72019.x													WOS:000082633800005
J	Tessier, AJ; Leibold, MA				Tessier, AJ; Leibold, MA			Habitat use and ecological specialization within lake Daphnia populations	OECOLOGIA												Many species of planktonic cladocerans display substantial variation in habitat use (mean depth and diel vertical migration), both among and within populations. We examined whether clonal segregation and specialization contributes to such behavioral variation within several lake populations of the cladoceran, Daphnia pulicaria. Electrophoretic and quantitative genetic analysis of clonal lines isolated from different depths at night revealed that clonal habitat specialization was common. Clones that utilized shallow water at night were genetically smaller at maturity and lower fecundity under standard laboratory conditions than the deep-water clones. The magnitude of this clonal habitat specialization varied among lakes: populations displaying broad use of depth habitats contained greater genetic variance than populations with more constrained habitat use. These results are consistent with known differences in selective factors in different depth habitats and suggest that substantial clonal specialization can occur within single populations. Since previous work has discovered a heritable basis to habitat selection in several Daphnia species, including D. pulicaria in our study lakes, it is likely that clonal/depth specialization is an important factor affecting the trophic ecology of Daphnia.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				FEB	1997	109	4					561	570		10.1007/s004420050117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050117								28307340					WOS:A1997WM37800010

Analytical results showed that the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of fish at all sites increased from mid-May to early June. Although the GSI of fish at the southernmost and mid-latitude sites decreased from early to late June, the GSI decline was much more severe in fish at the southernmost site. In contrast, fish at the northernmost site exhibited no significant difference in GSI between early and late June. The proportion of females containing mature eggs decreased with latitude in early June but increased with latitude in late June, implying that bluegill at the southernmost site actively spawned in June and were in the final stage of spawning in late June, whereas fish at the northernmost site were still actively spawning in late June. These results suggest that the spawning season of bluegill in Lake Biwa varies from site to site; fish at lower latitudes begin to spawn earlier, and those at higher latitudes may have a longer spawning season.

J	Rek, P				Rek, Pawel			Are changes in predatory species composition and breeding performance responsible for the decline of Coots Fulica atra in Milicz Ponds Reserve (SW Poland)?	ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA												Both native and non-native predators should strongly affect resident fauna. Nevertheless, because of a lack of defensive mechanisms in potential prey, the influence of non-native predators should have longer-lasting and more deleterious repercussions. The breeding ecology of the Coot was studied in the Milicz Ponds reserve and compared with data from 20 years earlier. In the meantime, non-native, mammalian predators (American Mink Mustela vison Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides and Raccoon Procyon lotor) turned Lip in this area, while the numbers of Hooded Crow Corvus cornix, the main predator of Coot nests, decreased. Compared with 1980-1982, the number of Coots in 2002-2003 dropped by more than half and mean clutch size decreased. Breeding Success and the number of hatchlings per pair remained unchanged; in the 1980s, however, Coots renested more frequently, there was greater nesting synchrony and breeding seasons were demonstrably shorter. Moreover, although predation still remained the main cause of losses, its number, were decreasing. Coots nesting on islands were the most Successful, which was due to the weaker predation on the part of Crows. In contrast, the mammalian (non-native) predators did not appear to play a significant role in the breeding success in 2002-2003. Nevertheless, taking into account the breeding parameters of the Coot Population and the nature of the relationship between mammalian/bird predators and Coots, it does seem that the low density of Coots in 2002-2003 was a reaction to the pressure of mammalian predators.

ATTRIBUTES OF A BREEDING POPULATION OF PEREGRINE FALCONS ASSOCIATED WITH RESERVOIRS ON THE COLORADO RIVER	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												We describe results from a comprehensive effort to survey and monitor Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) breeding in Lake Mead National Recreation Area (LMNRA) from 2006-2010. We identified 37 breeding territories, and the annual occupancy rate averaged 94%. Pooled over time, breeding success was 72%, and average reproductive output was 1.8 young per nesting attempt. The closest distance between eyries from neighboring territories was 1.2 km; the lowest annual mean nearest-neighbor distance (NND) was 6.3 km. No relationship was apparent between NND and breeding success or reproductive output. Nesting attempts occurred twice as often in eyries with a north-facing (68%) aspect than in eyries with a south-facing (32%) aspect. Pairs using south-facing eyries began incubating 5 d earlier than those using north-facing eyries, although the difference was not statistically significant. On a finer scale, pairs most commonly selected northwest-facing eyries (45% of nesting attempts), despite experiencing a trend of lower mean breeding success (64%) than in eyries with aspects facing all other quadrants (83%). Within territories, peregrines used alternate eyries following 58% of nesting attempts; however, switching eyries between years did not influence breeding success. Peregrines appear to be largely year-round residents at LMNRA, based on monthly surveys at five territories during a nonbreeding season (August 2008 through January 2009). We also detected peregrines at 10 of 24 territories in September and October 2009 using 10-min call-broadcast surveys at eyrie cliffs. Our results contribute to knowledge of increasing populations of peregrines following the DDT era in the southwestern U.S., and provide insight about how reservoirs may influence local breeding populations.

J	Efitre, J; Chapman, LJ; Makanga, B				Efitre, J; Chapman, LJ; Makanga, B			The inshore benthic macroinvertebrates of Lake Nabugabo, Uganda: seasonal and spatial patterns	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, is a lake of particular interest because of the unusual nature of its benthic macroinvertebrate community In this study we quantified the spatial and temporal distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates within the lake with a focus on habitat associations in inshore areas. We focused on four inshore habitats: Nymphaea lotus/Nymphaea caerulea (water lily), Miscanthidium violaceum, Vossia cuspidata (hippo grass) and forest edge. The most notable characteristic of the Nabugabo fauna was the absence of bivalves and crustaceans and the scarcity of gastropods that made up only 1.8 % of the numerical abundance of the benthos. The numerically dominant taxa were ephemeropterans (77.7 %) and dipterans (11.1 %). Annelids (5.4 %), odonates (2.8 %) and trichopterans (1.3 %) comprised a much smaller component of the benthic assemblage. Total invertebrate abundance and the abundance of major taxa did not vary significantly across months, but habitat effects were evident. The water-lily habitat was very depauperate, which may reflect the low levels of dissolved oxygen near the sediments in this habitat. Lake Nabugabo is extremely poor in salts, mean conductivity in inshore sites ranging from 22.3 to 26.4 muS/cm and 22.6 to 37.9 muS/cm (K-25) for surface and bottom waters, respectively. The low conductivity (low concentrations of ions) in Lake Nabugabo may limit colonization by molluscs and crustaceans that, with their calcareous shells or exoskeletons, may require water with a higher mineral content.																			1562-7020	2224-073X				OCT	2001	36	2					205	216																WOS:000172734100011
J	Barton, DR				Barton, DR			The use of Percent Model Affinity to assess the effects of agriculture on benthic invertebrate communities in headwater streams of southern Ontario, Canada	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Benthic invertebrates were surveyed in 213 headwater streams in southern Ontario to test the utility of Percent Model Affinity (PMA) for assessing the relative impact of agriculture on invertebrate communities. Qualitative samples were collected from reference (= forested, sixty-nine samples) and agricultural (195 samples) streams between May 1990 and August 1993. The percentage composition of samples from reference streams was averaged by season and type of substratum, and the most homogeneous groupings were used as expected communities for the calculation of PMA. 2. The lower confidence limit about the mean PMA for each expected community was calculated as for a one-tailed t-test comparing a single observation with the mean of a sample. Samples from agricultural streams whose PMA scores were outside these confidence limits were judged to indicate significant impact. 3. The sensitivity of PMA to differences in land use increased with taxonomic resolution: 40% of agricultural sites were significantly different from reference communities at the ordinal level, 79.5% were significantly different at the lowest practical taxonomic level. Most of the increase in discrimination between reference and agricultural sites was due to Chironomidae. Identification to species, rather than genus, yielded only a small increase in discrimination between reference and agricultural sites, largely because of taxonomic difficulties and because most members of several diverse genera were very similar in their distributions. 4. All of the samples from streams which drained orchards and vinyards (n = 7) were significantly different from the expected communities, as were 89% of those from streams draining corn (n = 94). A larger percentage of streams draining hay (78%, 26) were impacted than were streams bordered by pasture (66%, n = 51), but the average magnitude of impact was greater in pasture streams. Only six of eleven samples from streams draining tobacco indicated significant impact. 5. The effect of land use adjacent to the sampling site was greatest early in the growing season. Comparison of natural channels and ditches draining agricultural land suggests that channelization and subsurface tile drainage eliminate most of the benefits of riparian buffer strips and magnify the effects of farming practices on the benthic fauna.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1996	36	2					397	410		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00053.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00053.x													WOS:A1996VM61200015

J	Spaak, P; Hoekstra, JR				Spaak, P; Hoekstra, JR			Fish predation on a Daphnia hybrid species complex: A factor explaining species coexistence?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent studies on the life histories of Daphnia hybrids and their parental species have revealed that hybrids can combine an intermediate size with a relatively high reproductive rate, which might explain their success in many European lakes. Based on this information, we formulated the temporal hybrid superiority hypothesis to explain the coexistence of parental species and their hybrids. Our hypothesis states that in temporally changing environments, such as lakes, hybrids can coexist with their parental species because hybrid individuals have a higher fitness compared to the parental individuals during specific periods of the year. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that hybrids have a lower fitness than the parentals, which should be compensated by recurrent hybrid production. To test this hypothesis we studied population dynamics and seasonal changes in body size of two Daphnia species (D. galeata and D. cucullata) and their interspecific hybrid D. cucullata X D. galeata in Tjeukemeer, a shallow eutrophic lake in the Netherlands. In 1989, the year with the highest fish predation pressure, the larger D. galeata was first replaced by the smaller hybrid that was soon succeeded by the even smaller D. cucullata. In 1990 the Daphnia community was dominated by the hybrid and in 1991 by D. galeata. Deviations of the instantaneous rate of increase, averaged over the three species, showed a positive relationship with fish predation risk for D. cucullata, a negative relationship for D. galeata, and no relationship for the hybrid. This suggests a higher influence of fish predation on D. galeata. We conclude that the selective advantage of the hybrid over D. galeata under fish predation, expected from life-history experiments, is in agreement with our field data.																			0024-3590					JUN	1997	42	4					753	762		10.4319/lo.1997.42.4.0753	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.4.0753													WOS:000071037700013

AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Macrophage centres have been considered as a potentially useful indicator of fish health. In this histological work we tested this hypothesis with macrophage centres (MCs) in the spleen, the liver and the hematopoietic part of the kidney of two common freshwater fish species in Finland, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). Samples were collected over 5 seasons from a system of 4 lakes providing a gradation in water quality. The mean number of MCs/mm(2) and the area covered (mu m(2)/mm(2)) by them differed between individual fish, species, organs, and lakes, with interactions amongst these factors. Hemosiderosis was recorded from the spleen and liver of both fish species; amounts differed between species of fish, organs, and lakes. None of the observed patterns agreed with rankings of water quality, and we conclude that macrophage centres have limited usefulness as indicators of pollution.																			0166-445X	1879-1514				MAR	1996	34	3					253	272		10.1016/0166-445X(95)00042-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-445X(95)00042-3													WOS:A1996UG28500005

Field studies were carried out during the growing seasons of 2000 and 2005. The obtained results allowed to estimate the following parameters that characterize the spatial structure of macrophytes: species frequency in particular ecological groups, the average vegetation cover in these groups, the average cover of particular species, both in the whole reservoir and in different depth ranges, as well as the PVI (Percent Volume Infested) coefficient for ecological groups. The frequency and cover of some species and ecological groups of macrophytes changed during the study period.

J	Honrath, RE; Sweet, CI; Plouff, CJ				Honrath, RE; Sweet, CI; Plouff, CJ			Surface exchange and transport processes governing atmospheric PCB levels over lake superior	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Measurements of gas phase PCB concentrations obtained at a site on the shore of Lake Superior are analyzed to determine the importance of regional air/surface exchange as a determinant of PCB concentration over the lake. During periods of onshore flow, results obtained in congener-specific regression analyses of log concentration against reciprocal temperature are strongly dependent upon time of year. During months when the lake is colder than the overlying air (resulting in a stable atmosphere over the lake), regressions for onshore flow explain 48-63% of the observed variance in log C, and the regression slope and intercept are consistent, with Henry's law equilibrium between the lower atmosphere over the lake and aqueous concentrations. Results consistent with Henry's law are obtained only when water temperature is assumed to be similar to air temperature measured at the site during flow off the lake; poor regression results (r(2) = 0.00-0.06) are obtained when lake water temperature measured by data buoys is used. Based on consideration of the spatial variability of lake skin temperature during onshore flow periods, it is inferred that, under stable conditions, air/water equilibrium is reached rapidly and that atmospheric concentrations at the measurement sire are primarily affected by air/water exchange within 10-30 km offshore. These results are consistent with consideration of potential limitations of regression analyses of log C versus reciprocal tempera ture. Furthermore, they indicate that the net exchange of PCBs during the stable season over large lakes (April-August or September for Lake Superior) may be significantly less than previously estimated. Regression analyses based on samples obtained during onshore flow in the unstable season and during over-land flow exhibit increased scatter and are inconsistent, with the hypothesis of upwind equilibrium controlled by either Henry's law- or vapor pressure-mediated exchange at local temperatures. This result is consistent with rate limitations to atmosphere/surface exchange over the lake and land surface and with the effect of atmospheric mixing processes. Implications of these results to the interpretation of concentration measurements al. lakeside sites and the use of such measurements in calculations of the air/water exchange flux of PCBs over large lakes are discussed.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR	1997	31	3					842	852		10.1021/es960645s	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es960645s													WOS:A1997WK81500061

The results obtained highlighted a low and quite homogeneous PCB contamination of the studied area. Surface seawater samples from Gerlache inlet and Wood Bay showed a typical PCB concentration of 130 pg/liter, and an increase after pack ice melting of about 30-40%.

Observations are used to propose the physical mechanism governing convection and to formulate a model of deep ventilation. The key physical mechanism governing deep-water renewal is the so-called thermobaric instability. Because the temperature of maximum density decreases with depth, a lake can become conditionally unstable if the base of the cold mixed layer is displaced to a depth at which its temperature matches the local temperature of maximum density, thereby resulting in sinking plumes. An important consequence of this phenomenon is that deep temperate lakes such as Baikal do not completely mix twice yearly; instead, deep ventilation is episodic. A two-dimensional model of a wind- and buoyancy-driven lake shows many strong mixing events and a fairly realistic seasonal cycle, indicating that the hypothesis is physically realizable. A filling-box model is used to deduce the annually averaged fluxes necessary to produce a steady vertical distribution of tracers as observed. Good fits are obtained to oxygen and chlorofluorocarbon distributions by this model.					matear, richard/C-5133-2011	matear, richard/0000-0002-3225-0800; Weiss, Ray/0000-0001-9551-7739													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1996	41	7					1521	1538		10.4319/lo.1996.41.7.1521	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.7.1521													WOS:A1996WU27300016

Pigment composition was measured in natural phytoplankton samples from Lake Kinneret, Israel. From March through June 1998, the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense Nygaard mostly contributed more than 95% of the algal biomass. Peak densities were found in April, close to the water surface, with > 10(9) cells m(-3), chlorophyll (Chl) a concentration of 380 mg m(-3) and areal Chl-a density of > 1300 mg m(-2). 2. Cellular concentrations of Chl-a changed between 201 and 282 pg cell(-1), but did not show a defined temporal fluctuation. 3. The mass ratio of Chl-c to Chl-a changed from March to June between 0.16 and 0.22, and the peridinin to Chl-a ratio changed from 0.25 to 0.41. Neither ratio showed a clear pattern of seasonal change. Conversely, there was a progressive increase in diadinoxanthin and beta-carotene ratios to Chl-a through the season, parallel to the increase in photon flux impinging upon the lake surface. The diadinoxanthin to Chl-a ratio changed from 0.11 to 0.28 and the beta-carotene to Chl-a ratio varied from 0.03 to 0.08 from March through June. 4. Diatoxanthin was not detected in natural samples. However, it was present in experiments with P. gatunense cultures, when concentration of diatoxanthin increased rapidly, concurrent with a decrease in diadinoxanthin and beta-carotene concentrations, while Chl-c and peridinin ratios to Chl-a were almost stable with photon flux increase. 5. The seasonal variation in cellular pigmentation of P. gatunense in Lake Kinneret suggests that accumulation of photoprotective pigments is essential for optimisation of photosynthetic activity of this large dinoflagellate.																			0046-5070					OCT	2003	48	10					1850	1858		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01135.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01135.x													WOS:000185347900012
J	SHANNON, JD; VOLDNER, EC				SHANNON, JD; VOLDNER, EC			MODELING ATMOSPHERIC CONCENTRATIONS OF MERCURY AND DEPOSITION TO THE GREAT-LAKES	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Regional patterns of seasonal and annual average air concentrations and cumulative deposition of mercury to the Great Lakes basin are calculated with the ASTRAP model. The model treats the Hg system as three chemical components: elemental (Hg-0), particulate (Hg-p), and gaseous divalent (Hg-II). Primary anthropogenic emission inventories (i.e. emissions resulting from current activities) include surface and elevated sources of each of the three Hg species for eastern North America. Natural and secondary anthropogenic emissions (i.e. reemission of Hg deposited or released during earlier anthropogenic activity) over the United States and Canada are estimated by defining an emission term for Hg-0 that varies with latitude and season. Global background concentrations of Hg-0 and Hg-p are specified to average annually 1.0 and 0.01 ng m(-3), respectively. Rates of parameterizations of wet and dry removal are very rapid for Hg-II, intermediate for Hg-p, and very slow for Hg-0. Because of the disparate removal efficiencies, estimates of deposition resulting from anthropogenic emissions are critically dependent upon the speciation of emissions and, for the rapidly depositing Hg-II, the assumptions about effective stack heights. Integration of the Hg deposition field over the Great Lakes produces estimates of direct atmospheric loading from primary anthropogenic emissions of 1.44 and 2.46 t Hg yr(-1) by wet and dry deposition, respectively. Estimates of direct loading from natural and secondary anthropogenic emissions of Hg-0 over the continent are 0.09 and 0.15 t Hg yr(-1) for wet and dry deposition, respectively, while the corresponding contributions from the global background are estimated to be 0.15 and 0.39 t Hg yr(-1), respettively. Although they constitute only 16% of estimated anthropogenic emissions, emissions of Hg-II contribute 78% of the current direct anthropogenic deposition to the Lakes, or 65% of the deposition df Hg from all sources. Revolatilization of Hg-0 from the Lakes is estimated to lie between 2.3 and 13.7 t Hg yr(-1). Thus, revolatilization may well be greater than the direct atmospheric loading of all Hg species to the Lakes, 4.7 t Hg yr(-1).																			1352-2310					JUL	1995	29	14					1649	1661		10.1016/1352-2310(95)00075-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1352-2310(95)00075-A													WOS:A1995RJ09500007

Stream water was sampled at all stream-road intersections across the watershed on 10 occasions in 1993 and 1994. Maps of herbicide distribution established that widespread, seasonal contamination of streams in Goodwater Creek Watershed was due to nonpoint sources (e.g., widespread, but normal farm use) rather than from point sources. Box plots documented concentration variability over time. Concentrations of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) deethylatrazine [2,4-diamino-6-chloro-N-(l-methylethyl)-1,3,5-tria deisopropylatrazine [2,4-diamino-6-chloro-N-ethyl-1,3,5-triazine], and metolachlor [2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)acetamide] were also monitored at least weekly from 1993 to 1994 at three V-notch webs through which 16.7, 43.4, and 100% of the watershed drained. Atrazine, deethylatrazine, and metolachlor were detected year round at concentrations above 0.1 mu g/L. Atrazine concentrations observed at webs were occasionally >100 mu g/L and were similar to edge-of-field concentrations observed elsewhere shortly after spraying in May to June, probably because the watershed's poorly drained, silt loam soils contain a restrictive claypan horizon that limits infiltration and encourages surface runoff.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	1998	27	5					999	1009		10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700050004x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700050004x													WOS:000076059600003

The specificity of this assemblage lies in the presence of freshwater fish identified for the first time by an archaeozoological study. In agreement with the epigraphic data attesting to fish breeding in the lake, the hypothesis that these fish were acclimatized in this fresh water pond is advanced through the study of historical, archaeological and geomorphological data. The management of these fish resources (species selection, acclimatization, seasonal management, capture) presupposes a degree of proficiency in freshwater fish breeding in Hellenistic times and is the only case study of its kind in terms of the set of sources mobilized.																			2352-409X					DEC	2019	28								102029	10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102029													WOS:000508224600014

It has been suggested that climate change has altered the primary productivity of the system, but detailed knowledge of the system's food web is required to elucidate the effect on higher trophic levels. The aim of this study is to determine the diet of the three commercially important fish species. Muscle tissue samples for stable isotope analysis were taken from February through April 2017, supplemented with stomach samples from L stappersii for use in stomach content analysis. The stomach analysis showed an ontogenetic change in the diet composition of L stappersii, shifting from copepods to fish larvae, supplemented with shrimp, to whole fish prey as the fish grew larger. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values from fish muscle were consistent with this observation, and also seemed to indicate that fish of similar sizes had similar diets, irrespective of species. This suggests that the diet of the pelagic fish species might be better explained by size, rather than species. The isotope data revealed a short range of delta N-15 values from primary consumers to fish, which may help explain the high fisheries productivity of Lake Tanganyika, and the strong impact of primary productivity changes on fisheries yield.

Temporal patterns of wetland-associated bird assemblages in altered wetlands in Turkey	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												A loss of wetlands, one of the highly sensitive ecosystems, necessitates the monitoring and assessment of wildlife population trends for the continuity and sustainable management of species. The goal of our study was to evaluate temporal changes in wetland-associated bird composition by conducting monthly counts during December 2006 - November 2007 and March 2015 - February 2016 in Efteni Lake, Duzce, Turkey. This lake has been exposed to structural change including shoreline length, area and depth for the last 50 years. Wetland-associated bird richness decreased, and abundance increased during the decade, but this change was not significant except for two species with an increased population, ferruginous duck Aythya nyroca and great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus. Cluster analyses resulted in two groups: the breeding season from April to September, and the non-breeding season from October to March. The most numerous species were observed mostly during the non-breeding season. Some guilds, including diving carnivores, omnivores, shoreline omnivores and herbivores species were more prevalent during the non-breeding season. The insectivores had higher population densities during the breeding season. Thus, wetland-associated bird abundance during the non-breeding season was higher than during the breeding season, although species richness was the opposite. The planned restoration of habitats of Efteni Lake should have a positive impact on birds by creating more space available to them. Our result should help to better understand the impact of habitat changes on waterbird assemblages. Long-term monitoring of Efteni Lake will be useful for the wetland-associated avian community, and for other animal and plant communities.																			1505-2249					DEC	2019	67	4					316	330		10.3161/15052249PJE2019.67.4.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2019.67.4.004													WOS:000519720300004

Ribbon lakes are a special case as extremely steep slopes of the lake basin cause their littoral zone to be narrow. The Durowskie ribbon lake was chosen as a model for the assessment of the ecological status of waters based on its Diatom Index. Given its use in recreation, it is under heavy anthropogenic pressure. Physicochemical and biological parameters were monitored in the peak of the vegetational season (July, August) between 2010 and 2018 at 12 varied littoral sites across the full length of the shoreline. This long-term analysis of the Diatom Index, despite showing an improvement in the quality of water, demonstrated the ecological state of Lake Durowskie to be weak (southern, deep part) to moderate (north, shallow part). The taxonomic structure of diatoms (referral and indicator taxa) in phytobenthos communities allowed to show the changes in physicochemical parameters of the environment such as pH, oxygen dissolved in water and its trophic status. Research results are shown in relation to the anthropogenic changes to the lake's direct catchment area and the results of the physicochemical monitoring of waters.																			1898-6196					DEC	2019	26	4					709	726		10.1515/eces-2019-0014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eces-2019-0014													WOS:000505159900008

On the Validation of Satellite Microwave Remote Sensing Data under Soil Salinity Conditions	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												The results of a comparative analysis of the underlying surface brightness temperature obtained from the SMOS satellite and calculated with the use of ground-based measurements of moisture and the laboratory measurements of dielectric characteristics of samples of saline soils and saline water from test sites of the Kulunda Steppe are presented. The values of the underlying surface brightness temperatures calculated with the use of ground investigations and the laboratory studies correlate satisfactorily with the values of brightness temperatures measured from the SMOS satellite. The deviations can be caused by the seasonal drying of highly mineralized shallow lakes, which results in a significant change in the areas occupied by lakes and the appearance (instead of a water surface) of wetlands with a high content of mineral salts, whose radio emission characteristics differ from the characteristics of the water surface and the soil cover.

Lake Rio Cuarto is a maar-type meromic lake located in the plains of Northern Costa Rica, in the past there have been no limnological studies more than a year of sampling. in this work we present data on the composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton over four years, from 2013 to 2017, with the aim of analyzing changes in the plankton community in a longer period, associated with environmental variables. Phytoplankton was studied from subsurface samples, preserved in Lugol's solution and zooplankton from 20 m vertical hawls of a 64 mu m mesh net, and preserved with fonnaline and later transferred to 95 % ethanol. Phytoplankton composition included 54 taxa, most of them were Chlorophyta, followed by Cyanobacteria and Bacillariophyta. The most abundant were: Synechococcus spp.. Aphanocapsa sp. Coenochloris fotii, Chlorella sp. and Discostella stelligera. Total phytoplankton decreased from 2013 to 2017, mainly due to a decrease in Cyanobacteria. Zooplankton comprised 14 taxa, 5 cladocerans, 4 copepods, 1 diptera and 4 rotifers. The most abundant were: Keralella americana, Brachionus falcatus, Eubosmina tubicen and Arctodiaptomus dorsalis. There was a substitution of dominant species through time, at first (2013-2014) K. americana and E. tubicen alternated in dominance, and later (2015-2016), A. dorsalis, Diaphanosoma sp. and Ceridaphnia sp. became dominant, with a return of K. americana by 2017. The changes that occurred during the time of the study seem to be related to changes in the conditions of the lake, since its thermocline deepened with time and became more transparent. The abundance, of rotifers and Eubosmina tubicen, decreased associated to a decrease of Cyanobacteria. Those changes were not cyclical on an annual basis, but seemed to occur more on a long-term basis, as has been recognized earlier in the literature about tropical lakes.																			0034-7744	2215-2075				DEC	2019	67	6					1543	1559																WOS:000518895600031

Specifically, a study on whether there are specific temporal properties that could be more related to spatial dissimilarity remains to be seen. We examined the extent to how spatial dissimilarity changed with seasonal succession by measuring beta-diversity in phytoplankton communities in Lake Erhai (from January 2012 to December 2014 at 15 sampling sites) as a function of different period conditions (high-density period and low-density period). We found that congruences of spatial dissimilarity in algal communities over time were neither stable in time nor showed a seasonal pattern. The spatial dissimilarity congruence between the phytoplankton community and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentration followed exponential decay patterns, and this congruence was led by algal cell density. This result implies that species and functions of phytoplankton are specialized, and DIP concentration drastically increases in high-density periods than in low-density periods. This means that DIP enrichment is related to the loss of algal diversity and functions and the increase of algal biomass in eutrophic lakes.

J	Mayo, JS; Jackson, DA				Mayo, Julianne S.; Jackson, Donald A.			Quantifying littoral vertical habitat structure and fish community associations using underwater visual census	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We developed and tested a new visual census technique to quantify the importance of vertical habitat structure on the associated fish assemblages in the littoral zone of a freshwater lake. We demonstrated that the primary environmental gradient, accounting for the most variation in the species data, represented a temporal gradient of seasonal characteristics. The secondary environmental gradient was related to the vertical structure at the sampling locations, showing the importance of the vertical component of the environment on fish community structure. Characterizing the vertical component at different resolutions provided different interpretations. The primary difference was the strength of influence of woody material on community structure. Woody material had a stronger influence on community structure throughout the water column when a single vertical unit defined the fish data. The appropriateness of defining the data by either multiple vertical strata or by a single vertical one would be dependent on the objectives of the study, as neither approach was found to explain substantially more variation in the species data. The current study demonstrates that fish are closely associated with particular elements of habitat structure in the littoral zone, even in the absence of major piscivorous predators. We provide a novel study quantifying the vertical multiple habitat structures and habitat use by fish in the water column of a freshwater lake. The new vertical visual census technique can be used to more comprehensively sample the three-dimensional environment of lake littoral zones, and quantify the fish-habitat spatial relationships across a range of abiotic and biotic habitat features.

J	Booth, AJ; Weyl, OLF				Booth, AJ; Weyl, OLF			Investigations into a potential directed fishery for Labeo cylindricus on Lake Chicamba, Mozambique	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												This study considers the implications of directed fishing for Labeo cylindricus on Lake Chicamba, Mozambique. Labeo cylindricus is currently a minor by-catch of a multi-gear and multi-species, small-scale fishery and only contributes 1.2% to the annual catch of 302 tons. Experimental gill-netting revealed that cyprinids dominated the experimental catch in 25 mm and 50 mm gill-nets, a scenario that could lead to the implementation of these gears in harvesting an under-exploited stock. Results from a stochastic dynamic pool model using two stock-recruitment relationships revealed that it is possible to harvest L. cylindricus at fishing mortalities in excess of three times those currently expended, without detriment to spawner biomass. Complications arising from the potamodromous life history of L. cylindricus were considered. It is suggested that a directed fishery for L. cylindricus would only be feasible if directed fishing for the spawning stock could be mitigated through a closed season or by closed areas.

Trends and patterns in polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -dibenzofurans in eggs and plasma	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) eggs were collected from 1991 to 1997 at nests (n = 121) upstream and downstream of bleached kraft pulp mills and at reference sites in the Fraser and Columbia River drainage systems of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Blood samples were collected from nestling ospreys during the 1992 breeding season on the Thompson River. Samples were analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and -dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Mean concentrations of 2,3,7,8-TCDD were significantly higher in eggs collected in 1991 at downstream compared to upstream nests near pulp mills at Kamloops and Castlegar, British Columbia. There were no significant temporal trends in 2,3,7,8-TCDD, -TCDF or other measured compounds at a sample of nests monitored between 1991 and 1994 downstream of the Castlegar pulp mill, despite changes in bleaching technology (CIO2 substitution). However, by 1997 concentrations of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and -TCDF were significantly lower than previous years in nests sampled downstream at both Castlegar and Kamloops. An unusual pattern of higher chlorinated PCDDs and PCDFs was found in many of the osprey eggs collected in this study, and considerable individual variation in the pattern existed among eggs from the same site. For example, eggs from four different nests at one study area (Quesnel) on the Fraser River had concentrations of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD ranging from <1 to 1,100 ng/kg and OCDD from <1 to 7,000 ng/kg wet weight. Higher mean concentrations of HpCDD and OCDD were found in eggs from the Thompson River, a tributary of the Fraser, compared to the Columbia River, and concentrations were generally higher at nests upstream of pulp mills. In plasma samples, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD and OCDD were the main compounds detected, with no significant differences measured between samples upstream versus downstream or earlier versus later in the breeding season. Use of chlorophenolic wood preservatives by lumber processors was considered the main source of higher chlorinated PCDD/Fs throughout the systems, based on patterns of trace PCDFs in eggs and significant correlations between egg concentrations of pentachlorophenol and both HpCDD (r = 0.891, p < 0.01) and OCDD (r = 0.870 p < 0.01).																			0090-4341					NOV	1998	35	4					620	631		10.1007/s002449900424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449900424								9776780					WOS:000076716400010
J	WIACKOWSKI, K; BRETT, MT; GOLDMAN, CR				WIACKOWSKI, K; BRETT, MT; GOLDMAN, CR			DIFFERENTIAL-EFFECTS OF ZOOPLANKTON SPECIES ON CILIATE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An in situ bioassay experiment using Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, Daphnia rosea, Diaptomus novamexicanus, and Holopedium gibberum single-species treatments was conducted to assess the influence of these zooplankters on the ciliate community structure of Castle Lake, California. At peak ambient abundances for adult individuals, these zooplankters all strongly depressed ciliate population growth rates. The ranking of the zooplankton-imposed ciliate death rates, from least to most severe, was Holopedium << Daphnia = Diaptomus <<< Diacyclops. The ranking of ciliate-taxa-response death rates to the zooplankton treatments was Halteria = Mesodinium < Askenasia = Urotricha = (Askenasia <) Strobilidium << Strombidium. As total ciliate abundance was depressed by the zooplankton treatments, the relative frequency of the small ciliates (approximately 5,000 mum3) increased, and the relative frequency of the larger ciliates (approximately 20,000 mum3) decreased. These results suggest that both seasonal and long-term shifts in zooplankton community structure have the potential to dramatically alter the dynamics and structure of ciliate communities.

A conceptual rainfall-runoff model including lake routing is used to simulate runoff and lake levels and to compute quasi-steady state conditions and long-term transient situations. It is suggested that models can be used to construct curves relating lake levels to precipitation and lake evaporation.

Trends in benthic macroinvertebrate community biomass and energy budgets in Lake Sevan, 1928-2004	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water levels of Lake Sevan (Armenia) were artificially lowered by nearly 20 m between 1949 and 1997. Lowered water levels, combined with increased eutrophication, were associated with seasonally anoxic conditions (lasting 1-4 months) near the bottom of the profundal zone each year during 1976-2004. In addition, the extents of the macrophyte zone and of certain substrate types were severely reduced following drawdown. Maximal depth of occurrence decreased by 2-44 m for at least for 50 species of benthic macroinvertebrates between 1982 and 2004 compared to 1937-1961. Species richness of benthic macroinvertebrates declined from 25 to three species at depths where seasonal anoxia occurred. Total biomass increased by a factor of 10 from the period 1928-1948 to 1976-1979 then declined by a factor of 3 to 4 between 1987 and 2004. Energy flow through detritivores was more than tripled during 1976-2004 compared to 1928-1971, a result of increased plankton primary production. In contrast, energy flow through herbivorous benthic macroinvertebrates decreased by a factor of nearly 5, due to reduced areal coverage of macrophytes. Energy flow through filter feeders did not change over the time period examined, but energy flow through the entire zoobenthos community was nearly tripled. The biomasses of Oligochaeta, Chironomidae, and total zoobenthos showed a delayed response to changes in primary production of 7-9, 2, and 2-4 years, respectively. These patterns may provide a basis to predict results of restoration efforts based on the abundance of the zoobenthos in future years as the level of the lake is restored and water quality improves.

Development and application of a UV attainment threshold for the prevention of warmwater aquatic invasive species	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Abiotic factors are important regulators of biological invasion and a recent study in Lake Tahoe (CA/NV, USA) showed that ultraviolet radiation (UV) can play a role in mediating warmwater fish invasion. In this study we highlight field and laboratory experiments that indicate strong species related differences in UV-induced stress between native and non-native fish species inhabiting the nearshore environment in Lake Tahoe. We use this differential UV sensitivity to develop a UV Attainment Threshold (UVAT) that if realized could be used to reduce susceptibility to warmwater fish invasion in nearshore environments. The UVAT is a target value for water transparency based on: (1) incident solar UV exposure levels during peak spawning season, and (2) experimentally derived UV exposure levels lethal to larval warmwater fish. We suggest that this value can be easily measured, monitored, and targeted to reduce the establishment and spread of invasive fish species. We also discuss how the UVAT increases the cost effectiveness of invasive species management. This approach could be relevant for any aquatic invasive species that is UV sensitive and constrained to relatively shallow water environments by, e.g. requirements for warmer spawning temperatures. Because many aquatic systems are threatened by both invasive species and declining water transparency we suggest that this research could have important applications in many systems, particularly in colder more UV transparent waters found in regions such as western North America.

Studies on bacterioplankton and inhibitory strains of aquatic actinomycetes in Lake Bardawil, Egypt	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Lake Bardawil represents a hyper-saline shallow (50-600 cm deep) water basin lying along the northern shore of Sinai. Surface water samples were collected monthly from this lake for physico-chemical and microbiological analysis. Seasonal variations in the averages of temperature, pH and transparency of the tested water samples were determined. Seasonal averages of the total bacterial counts at 22 and 37 degrees C, biovolumes of cells and bacterial biomass of the lake's water at different regions were also determined. In addition to the gram-negative pathogen, Edwardsiella tarda, faecal contamination indicators, total coliforms, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were counted in the lake's water samples from various regions during different seasons. The number of actinomycetes per milliliter of the lake's water samples were determined. Fifteen actinomycetes were isolated and screened for their antibacterial activity against E. coli and pathogenic E. tarda isolated from the same water samples. Five isolates of these actinomycetes showed antibacterial activities and nine of them were identified as Streptomyces. The most antibacterially active isolate was subjected to morphological, physiological and biochemical studies and identified as Streptomyces viridiviolaceus. The identified organism exhibited antimicrobial activities against the main indicator of water pollution, E. coli, pathogenic E. tarda, Corynebacterium michiganese B-33, Pseudomonas solanacearum B-3212 and Staphylococcus. No antimicrobial activities were recorded against Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus, Mycobacterium, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis or Rhizopus nigricans.

Changes in total iron concentrations in water and in fish tissues were studied after the impoundment of the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir (central Lao PDR). Water quality parameters were monitored at 11 stations (reservoir, upstream area and downstream areas) from 2008 to 2010. In 2009 and 2010, total iron concentrations were measured in three different fish tissues (viscera, gills and flesh) from 14 species belonging to the omnivorous and carnivorous feeding groups. The results indicated that iron concentrations in the water were influenced by the reservoir impoundment during the first year after the creation of the reservoir. Intra-annual variations of the total iron concentration in these waters appeared to be driven by the soil leaching processes mainly during the wet season. In fish, total iron accumulated preferentially in viscera, followed by gills and flesh. Iron concentration was highly species dependant and related to the ecology of the species whereas feeding habits (omnivorous or carnivorous) did not influence total iron concentration in fish tissues.

The morphology, water quality and biological productivity of the lagoon had being subjected to noteworthy changes over the years under the influence of natural as well as human interference. Recent research have revealed that the lagoon losses its biological integrity due to more sedimentation from rivers predominantly in monsoon seasons, lagoon mouth closure, overfishing, pollution from various phenomena such as usage of motor boats, sewage disposal and aquaculture farms. In this work, evaluation of the status of this lagoon in terms of its biological, physical and chemical importance, its flourishing inheritance, the threats to this ecosystem and the knowledge gaps with the recommendations towards protection of its declining biodiversity are discussed.

Smallmouth bass (n = 18, size range 313-486 mm TL) captured and radiotagged following the tournament remained in the. immediate release vicinity for extended periods (mean 54 days, median 30 days). Four fish released at the site of original capture generally remained sedentary for the duration of the study (i.e., 11 months). Five of fourteen displaced smallmouth bass with radio tags returned to their original site of capture and-one bass with an external numbered plastic tag returned over a distance of 26 km. Smallmouth bass moved upstream and downstream to overwintering areas, characterized as low velocity pools, where numerous fish aggregated. Anglers recaptured twelve percent, or 13 of 108 externally tagged smallmouth bass. Maximum, distance between release and recapture was 84 km for externally tagged fish. Over half of recaptured fish were caught at the release site, and most were recaptured within one week of release. Organizers of competitive angling events in river systems should consider releasing fish near sites of original capture or in areas that are not readily accessible to minimize angling vulnerability immediately after tournaments.

Roux, 1833) from its type locality, the Lower Nile river in Egypt. Morphological characteristics were in line with a recent re-description of the species and with earlier descriptions of C. nilotica (C. nilotica var. typica, C. nilotica nilotica) from the river Nile with exceptions regarding the ranges of the number of teeth on the rostrum and spines on the telson. Sexes could be distinguished from a size of 12 mm; from a body size of 20 mm, ovigerous females were found. The number of eggs per female ranged from 43 to 147 and was positively correlated with body length. The sex ratio was female-biased and constant over the sampling period. Females grow larger than males. The development of gonads and eggs showed some seasonal variation. During the whole sampling period, all life cycle stages (juveniles, adult males, and non-ovigerous as well as ovigerous females) were present. Density was positively related with water temperature.

A total of 66 diatom taxa belonging to 24 genera were identified. Mastogloia was the most dominant genus in all sampling periods. Gomphonema, Cymbella and Nitzschia were the subdominant epiphytic diatom genera. Relationships between epiphytic diatom assemblages and measured limnological variables were extracted by means of Redundancy Analysis (RDA). It was revealed that temperature, calcium (Ca2+), sulphate (SO42-) and total soluble phosphate (TSP) parameters accounted for a significant amount of the variation in the distribution of the diatom assemblages. While some dominant taxa (e.g. Mastogloia smithii and Nitzschia amphibia) appeared relatively abundant in the cold waters with high calcium concentration, other taxa (e.g. Rhopalodia gibberula and Cymbella affinis) showed affinities towards warmer water with low calcium level. Cluster analysis produced four major groups reflecting the importance of seasonal influence on the epiphytic taxa. Formation of these seasonal clusters was controlled mainly by the increase and decrease of Mastogloia species. Influence of seasons on species compositions was also assessed in terms of Diversity index (H') and evenness (J) values.

J	Smayda, TJ; Thorne-Miller, B; Tomas, C				Smayda, Theodore J.; Thorne-Miller, Boyce; Tomas, Carmelo			Annual phytoplankton cycle in a meromictic anoxic basin of a Rhode Island (USA) estuarine river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Estuarine Pettaquamscutt River is a unique habitat 10 km in length with physical and biogeochemical characteristics analogous to a miniature fjord. Its meromictic upper basins are characterized by a permanent oxic-anoxic vertical gradient in which a well-oxygenated upper layer overlies a deeper, anoxic reservoir, with persistent blooms of phototrophic anoxygenic bacteria (Chromatium, Chlorobium) at the oxic-anoxic transition layer. A diverse assemblage of nanoplanktonic, centric diatoms (Cyclotella caspia, Thalassiosira pseudonana, cf. Cyclotella cryptica) dominated the seasonal phytoplankton cycle in the aerobic layer, similar to comparable meromictic habitats elsewhere. This assemblage of nano-centric diatoms appears to be trait-separated from other species clusters and is potentially useful as a functional group flora with ecophysiology diagnostic of marine estuarine rivers and meromictic habitat niche structure. The most conspicuous phytoplankton feature, however, was the year-round occurrence of the photoautotrophic euglenid Euglenaformis (Euglena) proxima, restricted in its upper water column distribution to the O-2-H2S boundary layer where it formed a consortium with the photosynthetic green and purple sulfur bacteria community. The association of E. proxima with meromixis, H2S, and phototrophic anoxygenic bacteria is similar to that reported previously in a brackish Norwegian oyster poll and a brackish loch in Scotland.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2020	847	2					501	518		10.1007/s10750-019-04113-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04113-z		NOV 2019											WOS:000494400700003
J	Griffith, S; Dellaert, F; Pradalier, C				Griffith, Shane; Dellaert, Frank; Pradalier, Cedric			Transforming multiple visual surveys of a natural environment into time-lapses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH												This article presents a new framework to help transform visual surveys of a natural environment into time-lapses. As data association across year-long variation in appearance continues to represent a formidable challenge, we present success with a map-centric approach, which builds on 3D vision for visual data association. We use a foundation of map point priors and geometric constraints within a dense correspondence image alignment optimization to align images and acquire loop closures between surveys. This framework produces many loop closures between sessions. Outlier loop closures are filtered in the frontend and in the backend to improve robustness. From the result map, the Reprojection Flow algorithm is applied to create time-lapses. The evaluation of our framework on the Symphony Lake Dataset, which has considerable variation in appearance, led to year-long time-lapses of many different scenes. In comparison with another approach based on using iterative closest point (ICP) plus a homography, our framework produced more and better-quality alignments. With many scenes of the 1.3 km environment consistently aligning well in random image pairs, we next produced 100 time-lapses across 37 surveys captured in a year. Approximately one-third had at least 20 (out of usually 33) well-aligned images, which spanned all four seasons. With promising results, we evaluated the pose error of misaligned image pairs and found that improving map consistency could lead to even better results.

The Lake Erie site (Stockton, NY) had PCB concentrations similar to rural Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network(IADN) sampling sites across the Great Lakes, exhibited limited seasonal variation, and approximates regional background. Samples taken along Lake Ontario's southeastern shore (Rice Creek and Sterling, NY) had elevated PCB concentrations averaging similar to1 ng/m(3) and were more chlorinated than air collected at IADN sites and at Stockton. Air samples from Potsdam (similar to 75 km inland) had similar concentrations but were less chlorinated. Clausius-Clapeyron plots revealed a strong correlation between PCB fugacity and temperature near Lake Ontario; however, the extent of chlorination of the air samples rules out volatilization from the lake as a major source. It is hypothesized that volatilization from local surfaces, enriched in higher chlorinated congeners by meteorological or geographic factors, drives both the concentration and composition of airborne PCBs along Lake Ontario's southeastern shore.

SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES												Collaborative watershed governance (CWG) is one strategy to address nonpoint source water pollution. While many collaborative watershed arrangements unfold in local settings, institutional analyses of CWG often do not consider landowners perceive intracommunity tensions about water pollution. We consider how diverse landowners attribute water pollution to agricultural and residential sources, and how these causal attributions may underpin perceived intracommunity tensions. We use survey data (n = 373) from the Owasco Lake watershed of central New York to examine water quality perceptions, concerns, and beliefs across year-round lakeshore, seasonal lakeshore, off shore residential, and agricultural landowners. Each type of landowner has a unique process through which water pollution causal attributions develop. Perceived intracommunity differences are more pronounced for non-farming landowners who blame agriculture for water pollution. With a better understanding of how landowners perceive the views of one another, watershed managers can tailor local communication efforts to emphasize shared views.					; Stedman, Richard/ACN-8032-2022	Armstrong, Andrea/0000-0002-1186-6139; Tucker, Grace/0000-0001-7261-0738; 													0894-1920	1521-0723				NOV 2	2019	32	11					1200	1221		10.1080/08941920.2019.1620390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1620390													WOS:000482841800002
J	Shen, ZF; Li, JL; Sheng, YW; Warner, TA; Zhao, LF				Shen, Zhanfeng; Li, Junli; Sheng, Yongwei; Warner, Timothy A.; Zhao, Lifang			A Multitemporal Remote Sensing Image Registration Method Based on Water Bodies for the Lake-Rich Region	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Accurate multitemporal remotely sensed image registration is essential for water body change detection and analysis of lake dynamics. However, lake-rich regions, such as Siberia, are mostly dominated by rivers and lakes, with few stable geometry features such as those typically used as control points for image registration. Lakes in Arctic regions are generally not static; their shorelines tend to expand and shrink seasonally, and may change substantially between different years, making it difficult to find consistent features for image registration. Consequently, traditional image-to-image registration methods, and even many sophisticated registration algorithms, rarely achieve accurate geometric correction in Arctic regions due to a lack of sufficient control points. In this article, we proposed a summary lake spatial attribute, the inferred deepest point of the lake (DPL), as a feature that is relatively insensitive to lake area changes, and therefore useful for registration of multitemporal images. The central focus of the DPL estimation algorithm is the identification of the largest inner circle (LIC) of the lake polygon. First, the internal Voronoi diagram of a lake polygon is calculated by the ``divide-and-conquer" method. The medial axis (MA) is then calculated by Voronoi diagram simplification, and finally, the LIC center is obtained by computing the distance from the MA intersection to all polygon edges. The approach was used to register HJ-1 and Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) images in Siberia, where water bodies dominate the landscape and change significantly over time. The proposed method found a large number of control points from the extracted water bodies. Subpixel registration accuracy of 0.62 pixels (18.5 m) and 0.33 pixels (19.6m) root mean square error (RMSE) was obtained for the HJ-1 and MSS images, respectively. In comparison, the alternative method of using lake centroids, only achieved 0.75 pixels (22.4 m) and 0.49pixels (29.3 m) RMSE. This registration accuracy improvement is potentially important for large-scale regional cartography and change detection applications.

Many chemical and biological factors are affected by this hydrologic seasonality, and it therefore appeared to be very likely that aquatic food webs would also differ during the low and high water periods. Available carbon sources for fish are thought to be less varied during low water periods, but flooding during high water periods could bring fish into contact with a greater abundance and diversity of food sources such as terrestrial plants or the biofilms that grow on submerged terrestrial plants. At low water levels, higher fish densities may lead to more piscivory and less omnivory when compared with the high water periods. Therefore, trophic links within the fish communities may then be modified by water level changes in tropical reservoirs. To address this prediction, we performed stable isotope analyses of the most common species in Selingue and Manantali, two large reservoirs in Mali (West Africa). Allochthonous and littoral carbon sources were shown to support fish production to a significant extent, even during low water periods. However, the allochthonous or littoral carbon contributions that sustained the top-predators production were indeed greater during the high water periods as expected. The expected higher omnivory in the high water period might have shortened the food chain when compared with the low water period. Some carnivorous fish species were shown to feed at lower trophic levels during high water periods in both reservoirs, but this was not a general pattern. Flooding did not, therefore, necessarily result in a shorter food chain when water levels were high.

An automated methodology was used to obtain higher spatial resolution than previously obtained. The increase in resolution was attained by using all available monthly snowfall data from over 1230 stations per year combined with a monthly time step to produce high-resolution grids. These monthly grids were combined to produce snow-year grids. Multiyear average grids were created and compared. This technique minimizes traditional problems associated with missing data and variable length station records. The three 10-year average distribution maps presented here indicate a period of increasing snowfall. Windowing of the 30 seasonal grids revealed that increasing snowfall was attributable to an increase in lake effect snowfall and not to continental snowfall. The Great Lakes drainage basin was evaluated for trends within and between monthly and seasonal average snowfall through windowing of all 240 monthly grids. The graphical and statistical evaluation of these trends indicates a strong natural variation in the region's snowfall and reveals an increasing trend during the study period.																			0894-8755					OCT	1993	6	10					1943	1956		10.1175/1520-0442(1993)006<1943:STILEA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1993)006<1943:STILEA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1993ME69200010

Thiobacillus ferrooxidans was also found in some of the streams but not in the lake itself. The lake water contains aqueous carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, polythionates and elemental sulfur in suspension which are the substrates for the growth of the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria as no organic compounds except for the microorganisms themselves were detected. The bacteria isolated from the Yugama water preferred polythionates in the following order: S4O62->S5O62->S6O62-. On the other hand, H2S was more rapidly consumed by the bacteria than polythionates which were followed by elemental sulfur. In the case of test-tube incubation, the optimum pH of the solution for growth of the bacteria was between 1.0 and 1.5, and for cultivation in growth medium plates between 2.5 and 3.5. The bacteria hardly proliferated at pH 0.5 or below. In accordance with these characteristics of the bacteria, numbers of the bacteria in the surface Yugama crater lake water were at minimum (<a few cells/mL) in February and at maximum (10(6) cell/mL) in August. The bacterial activity changed in accordance with the surface lake water temperature, but not necessarily with the variations in H2S and polythionates concentrations of the lake water. Based on the variation in sulfur isotope ratios of sulfate and experimentally determined rate of oxidation of H2S in the lake water, the sulfate production rate by the bacteria in the catchment area and the lake were estimated to 9.5 and 8.4 g/m(2)/day, respectively, during the period from 1988 to 1990 when the volcanic activity at Yugama was at minimum. Also stream, hydrothermal, H2S-oxidated SO42- inputs and outputs by seepage and precipitation have been calculated as 4.1, 32, 0.56, 36, and 1.2 ton/day, respectively.																			0168-2563					SEP	1997	38	3					227	253		10.1023/A:1005805100834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005805100834													WOS:A1997XQ28200001

Changes in lake communities can have significant consequences for ecosystem P cycles. At seasonal timescales, the relative importance of nitrogen (N) and P as limiting factors for primary production depends in part on zooplankton species composition. Phosphorus storage and recycling by fish and zooplankton can be large components of P budgets, and mobile consumers can be important vectors in P transport. Stability, resilience and resistance of lake P cycles may depend heavily on fluxes to and from upper trophic levels.					; Cottingham, Kathryn/AAV-3934-2021; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; 													0169-5347					OCT	1992	7	10					332	336		10.1016/0169-5347(92)90125-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-5347(92)90125-U								21236057					WOS:A1992JQ69200007

An optical age chronology of late Quaternary extreme fluvial events recorded in Ugandan dambo soils	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY					11th International Conference on Luminescence and Electron Spin Resonance Dating	JUL 24-29, 2005	Kardinal Schulte Haus, Cologne, GERMANY		Kardinal Schulte Haus			There is little geochonological data on sedimentation in dambos (seasonally saturated, channel-less valley floors) found throughout Central and Southern Africa. Radiocarbon dating is problematic for dambos due to (i) oxidation of organic materials during dry seasons; and (ii) the potential for contemporary biological contamination of near-surface sediments. However, for luminescence dating the equatorial site and semi-arid climate facilitate grain bleaching, while the gentle terrain ensures shallow water columns, low turbidity, and relatively long surface exposures for transported grains prior to deposition and burial. For this study, we focused on dating sandy strata (indicative of high-energy fluvial events) at various positions and depths within a second-order dambo in central Uganda. Bluelight quartz optically stimulated luminescences (OSL) ages were compared with infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and thermoluminescence (TL) ages from finer grains in the same sample. A total of 8 samples were dated, with 6 intervals obtained at similar to 35, 33, 16, 10.4, 8.4, and 5.9 ka. In general, luminescence ages were stratigraphically, geomorphically and ordinally consistent and most bluelight OSL ages could be correlated with well-dated climatic events registered either in Greenland ice cores or Lake Victoria sediments. Based upon OSL age correlations, we theorize that extreme fluvial dambo events occur primarily during relatively wet periods, often preceding humid-to-arid transitions. The optical ages reported in this study provide the first detailed chronology of dambo sedimentation, and we anticipate that further dambo work could provide a wealth of information on the paleohydrology of Central and Southern Africa.

BELGIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY					International Symposium on Aquatic Vascular Plants	JAN 11-13, 2006	Vrije Univ, Brussels, BELGIUM		Vrije Univ			In terms of phytosociology Nuphar lutea and Nymphaea alba are species characteristic of the same nymphaeid association. In many lakes, however, they develop separate communities. Habitat differences between patches of both species may thus be expected. The aim of this study was to find out if neighbouring patches of Nuphar lutea and Nymphaea alba were characterised by different water and substratum properties. Field investigations ware carried out in a shallow lake with well-developed macrophytic vegetation (Lake Jaroslawieckie, Wielkopolski National Park, mid-Western Poland). An additional sampling site was located in the macrophyte-free mid-lake. Water and substratum samples were collected twelve times during a two-year study Considering the whole data set, the water properties did not differentiate significantly the studied phytocoenoses and the open water. Temporal differences appeared to be more significant. In the case of substratum properties, habitat differentiation was found for organic matter content, which was significantly higher at the Nymphaea alba site, whereas total nitrogen content was higher at the mid-lake site. Seasonal dynamics of the habitats followed a similar pattern for the water properties, whereas differences in organic matter content were found for the substratum properties.					; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022	Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; 													0778-4031						2007	140	1			SI		73	82																WOS:000248804500008

It has been proposed that a small hook-shaped cape, now submerged, was present off the site during settlement from about 700 to 389 BC. Since 1992, however, most of Kaulonia's seafloor sector has been buried by a thick (to 4 m) sand cover. This investigation resumes study of Kaulonia's margin by high-resolution seismic survey, analysis of sediment in cores and excavated sections buried along the coast, and petrologic examination of rock used for construction of a temple, the site's major structure. The sector, located in the tectonically active Calabrian are, has been subject to considerable elevation rise of land onshore, and an equivalent rate of seafloor subsidence (similar to 1 mm/yr). A distinct Holocene sequence, composed of beachrock-type sandstone and fluvial-marine-transported conglomerate, in sediment sections landward of the beach can be traced seaward to depths of similar to 7 m about 300 m from the present shoreline. Correlation of the sequence helps define changes of coastline position from before Greek settlement to the present. Rather than a generally progressive migration landward of the shoreline in response to relative sea-level rise, the coast has experienced more complex shifts (sea-to-land, land-to-sea, and return to land) due to up-and-down motion in the sector between the alluvial plain behind the beach and innermost shelf. By the mid-Holocene, the shoreline had advanced seaward, resulting in coastal emergence, and it did not return landward (resubmerging the margin) until after the site's abandonment; submergence was complete by late Roman time. We now recognize a broad arcuate headland, rather than a small hooked cape, seaward of the site similar to 2500 years ago. Without a lagoon, sufficiently deep lake, or man-made port available for protected anchorage, vessels sailing to Kaulonia for trade were either beached or anchored close to shore and, perhaps seasonally, within the mouth of the Assi River. Composition of beachrock-type sandstone in Holocene sections on land is comparable to that offshore and also to sandstone used for temple base construction. Extensive sandstone exposures along this coast may have been one reason why Greeks selected the site for settlement.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2007	23	1					15	32		10.2112/06A-0017.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/06A-0017.1													WOS:000244333000002

The concentrations of metals (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Zn) were determined by AAS and ICP-MS, the dissolved fractions after separation by in-situ dialysis. Elements showing negative pH-correlation were primarily Al, Zn, Cd, Mn, and Pb, while Mo was positively correlated to pH, indicating a predominance of negatively charged ionic forms. Zn, Cd, and Mn occurred primarily in the dissolved fractions, especially at the lower pH levels. Fe, Al, Pb and Mn were further enriched in humic waters. During the study period, some of the sites were subject to lime treatment, which had a marked influence on most elements, causing the mean levels and the seasonal fluctuations to decrease. Treatment on the lake surface was less effective than wetland liming to reduce seasonal fluctuations, especially for metals mainly originating from the catchments, as Fe and Al.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	3				1757	1762		10.1023/A:1013913614863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013913614863													WOS:000172012000141

Because yellow perch abundance varies greatly among years and because the states may enforce differing management policies, it is important to define the degree to which stocks move among management jurisdictions. The length of the long axis of the first sagittal annulus (referred to as first annulus diameter) from adult yellow perch collected during 1986-1988 was used as an index of size at age at the end of their first growing season. Those measurements indicated that yellow perch collected as adults in Indiana waters were larger at the end of their first growing season than those collected elsewhere, even though they tended to be smaller at the time of capture, Whatever environmental or genetic factors determined the initial differences in size at a-c of age-0 yellow perch, the existence of geographic differences in this juvenile trait among fish captured as adults is evidence of geographic segregation of yellow perch stocks within southern Lake Michigan.																			0275-5947					AUG	2001	21	3					580	591		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0580:SATVIL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0580:SATVIL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289200015

MITIGATION OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM RICE FIELDS: POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF INCORPORATED RICE STRAW	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Increased world demand for rice production may lead to an increase in methane emission to the atmosphere and future global warming. One suggested way to reduce methane emission is to discourage the practice of incorporating previous crop residue prior to planting rice, since the residue may enhance methane emission from flooded rice fields. This concept is supported by data from a 2-year study of flooded rice fields on two different soil types in Texas. In 1990, rice stubble from 1989 was incorporated into both soils. Seasonal methane emission from a Lake Charles clay field increased from 15.9 g m(-2) in 1989 to 31.0 g m(-2) in 1990. In the Beaumont clay field, seasonal methane emission increased from 4.5 to 11.4 g m(-2). While methane emission increased between 1989 and 1990, grain yield dropped by 2100 and 840 kg ha(-1) in the Lake Charles and Beaumont fields, respectively. Visual inspection at harvest indicated that the 1990 rice yield decrease resulted from grain abortion, presumably caused by the rice cultivar's sensitivity to soil anaerobiosis. The calculated amount of organic carbon not translocated to grain was comparable to the estimated amount of organic carbon required for the increased methane emission. We hypothesize that labile carbon in straighthead susceptible rice cultivars can "leak" from roots damaged by excessively anaerobic soil and be metabolized to its equivalent in methane. These data suggest that minimizing incorporation of crop residue prior to planting can decrease methane emission from flooded rice and reduce the potential for yield loss, particularly with some cultivars and in soils with low rates of seepage and percolation.

The main use of the modelling studies was to extend flows back to the start of observations at Aswan in 1869, and hence to estimate the levels of Lake Victoria during the high flow event of the 1870s. New estimates of Lake Victoria levels and outflows for the period 1870-1895 are deduced, extending the length of the observed data for Lake Victoria by some 25%. Crucially, the analysis includes the major flood event of 1878, which historical evidence suggests was the highest since 1860 or earlier. The modelling results are compared with previous estimates and a detailed examination of historical evidence. Some prospects for future levels are considered, taking into account the reconstructed levels of the late nineteenth century.																			0262-6667					APR	2001	46	2					301	318		10.1080/02626660109492823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626660109492823													WOS:000168138800009

Reproduction occurred during a marked season in the agropastoral reservoirs and in Lake Ayame, whereas it was continuous in Lake Kossou. Spawning season differed between reservoirs and among years within the same reservoir. Seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall, day length, chlorophyll a concentration and water level often corresponded with changes in the annual spawning cycle. However, annual periodicity of O. niloticus reproduction was more likely influenced by the ephemerides cycle.					; Nunez, Jesus/J-4015-2016; Duponchelle, Fabrice/K-1998-2016	LEGENDRE, Marc/0000-0003-3122-2098; DUPONCHELLE, Fabrice/0000-0003-0497-2264; Nunez, Jesus/0000-0003-3668-5446; 													0378-1909					DEC	1999	56	4					375	387		10.1023/A:1007588010824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007588010824													WOS:000084346500005
J	Shaver, GR; Laundre, J				Shaver, GR; Laundre, J			Exsertion, elongation, and senescence of leaves of Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex bigelowii in Northern Alaska	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The seasonal patterns of leaf exsertion, elongation, and senescence were described and compared for two of the most abundant graminoid species of Alaskan moist tussock tundra, Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex bigelowii. In addition the responses of both species to NPK fertilizer and to variation in site fertility (water track vs. non-track areas) were also assayed and compared. The research was done over two full growing seasons at two sites near Toolik Lake, Alaska, where other aspects of the ecology of both species have been the subject of intensive and ongoing research. Both species showed the typical graminoid pattern of sequential leaf growth, in which the exsertion and elongation of new leaves is coincident with the senescence of old leaves. However, the rates of these processes were much slower and steadier in Eriophorum than in Carex, with much greater overlap in the life histories of individual leaf cohorts. The total and green leaf lengths of whole tillers in Eriophorum were also less variable over the entire year than in Carex. The conclusion is that leaf growth in Carex should depend more on external storage of carbon and nutrients than Eriophorum, with a much greater seasonal variation in demands on storage and retranslocation to and from leaves. The effects of fertilizer and the water track on leaf growth dynamics and turnover rates were largely nonsignificant, despite major effects on total tiller size and productivity. This is in contrast to previous research on evergreen leaf dynamics, but similar to results of previous research on overall production and biomass regulation in Eriophorum. It is concluded that the graminoid response to increased nutrient availability in the Arctic is to dilute the greater amounts of nutrient uptake by greater growth, so that nearly the same metabolic homeostasis is achieved as under low nutrient availability, but at a higher biomass.

The bacterial abundance varied from 2.67 to 5.1 Cells10(7) mL(-1) and did not show a typical temporal variation, presenting only small oscillations between the rainy and the dry periods. The bacterial biomass varied from 123 mu gC L-1 to 269 mu gC L-1 in the sampling sites and the average cellular volume varied from 0.12 to 0.54 mu m(3), showing a predominance of the rods. The temperature showed a positive correlation with the cellular volume of the rods (R= 0.55; p= 0.02) and vibrio ( R= 0.53; p= 0.03). Significant spatial differences of biomass ( Mann Whitney: p= 0.01) and cellular volume of the morphotypes ( Mann Whitney: p= 0.003) were found between the sampling sites.

Recovery assessment in Lake Nemi (Italy) after a twenty year period (1981-2001) using plant-associated invertebrates	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Lake Nemi was subjected to organic pollution in the 1970s due to domestic wastes, which led to a severe eutrophication process. Local authorities consequently planned a gradual waste diversion programme completed in 1990. Comparison between data on plant-associated invertebrates in the period of maximum eutrophication (1981/82) and twenty years after the total waste diversion (2001/02) was carried out with the aim of demonstrating the performance of this littoral community for the purpose of lake recovery assessment. Following the water clarity improvement characterizing the 2001/02 period, the macrophyte community displayed an amelioration in plant diversification, an enlargement of the colonized area, and an appearance of Charales, important bioindicators of oligotrophic conditions. In complete agreement with this new situation, the invertebrate fauna extended its colonization, and the species composition and quantitative structure changed completely. A considerable increase in species richness and diversity, and significant modifications of percentages and densities of bioindicator taxa (cladocerans, gastropods and acari) showed a very appreciable recovery, which can be defined as a phase of oligotrophication. This trophic state is closely related to nutrient reduction in the water and enhanced by a drift of organic materials from littoral to profundal bottoms. This was due to the remarkable water level reduction of about five meters which occurred in the lake in recent times.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2008	11	3					310	320		10.1080/14634980802093623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980802093623													WOS:000258625200006

A study of Daphnia-Leptodora-juvenile Percids interactions using a mathematical model in the biomanipulated Sulejow Reservoir	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												A model (DALIS 1.0) of pelagic zone trophic interactions was developed using long-term, comprehensive data sets of the Sulejow Reservoir. We calibrated the model using observations from the pelagic zone of the Sulejow Reservoir made between 1999 and 2001. The model performed well in the description of Daphnia sp. - L. kindtii interactions when hydrological conditions were stable. A discrepancy between observed and simulated results was found when water inflows were high, which washed out the biota. We suggested that the hydrological impacts should be coupled in the updated DALIS model. Using DALIS, we also tested two scenarios: the food web model (A) without Leptodora; and (B) without YOY fish, under both good and bad food conditions for Daphnia. Results indicated that Leptodora would have a more significant impact on the reduction of Daphnia biomass than juvenile fish during some periods. As the maintenance of high Daphnia densities is recognised as a key factor in top-down effects, the DALIS model may provide frameworks that support ongoing empirical work. It is therefore recommended that the model be incorporated into the programme of the Sulejow Reservoir restoration.

The growth yield was determined in dilution culture experiments, in which a substrate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the lake was incubated with a natural bacterioplankton assemblage. Bacterial growth efficiency varied annually from 8 to 60% with an average (and standard deviation) of 41 +/- 11% (n = 29). Simultaneous measurements of growth yield, substrate lability (DOC(L)), chlorophyll and bacterial production, abundance, and extracellular enzymatic activity revealed new aspects of the regulation of bacterial DOC utilization. Growth yield correlated positively to DOC(L) and negatively to beta-D-glucosidase activity. These results indicated a close coupling between the substrate conditions and the physiological response of the bacteria. The large variations in yield within a few days and the close coupling to substrate availability showed that one single global carbon yield factor cannot be expected to apply in pelagic systems.

C10S06	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] Measurements of Th-234/U-238 disequilibria were made on an approximately bimonthly basis over the course of a year in nearshore ( 10 - 40 m deep) and offshore ( 160 m deep) surface waters of the southern basin of Lake Michigan ( 18,100 km 2). The mean activity of U-238 in Lake Michigan measured 230 +/- 20 dpm m(-3), approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than what is typically found in marine systems. Measured median activities of dissolved (< 0.45 mu m) and excess particle- bound Th-234 were 8.0 and 60.6 dpm m(-3), respectively. Using a simple one-dimensional model, median residence times for dissolved and particle-bound Th-234 were similar to 1 and similar to 14 days, respectively. Th-234-based particle settling velocities had a median value of 0.4 m d(-1) (range: similar to 0.0 - 1.4 m d(-1)), and instantaneous Th-234-based estimates of the net vertical mass flux had a median value of 0.4 g m(-2) d(-1) ( range: similar to 0.0 - 5.2 g m(-2) d(-1)). Average particle settling velocities were generally constant over time and increased only slightly in the shallowest (10 m) sampling stations. Calculated mass fluxes showed a strong correlation with temporal and spatial changes in the concentration of total suspended matter, which, in the nearshore area, closely followed seasonal variations in wind-induced wave height. Using a simple two-box model, the Th-234-based cross-margin mass export rate for the entire southern basin of Lake Michigan was equal to 1.35 x 10(9) kg yr(-1), which is in excellent agreement with a Pb-210 - Cs-137 based, basin-wide mass sedimentation rate of 1.28 x 10(9) kg yr(-1).

J	Petersen, JH; Ward, DL				Petersen, JH; Ward, DL			Development and corroboration of a bioenergetics model for northern pikeminnow feeding on juvenile salmonids in the Columbia River	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												A bioenergetics model was developed and corroborated for northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis, an important predator on juvenile salmonids in the Pacific Northwest. Predictions of modeled predation rate on salmonids were compared with field data from three areas of John Day Reservoir (Columbia River). To make bioenergetics model estimates of predation rate, three methods were used to approximate the change in mass of average predators during 30-d growth periods: observed change in mass between the first and the second month, predicted change in mass calculated with seasonal growth rates, and predicted change in mass based on an annual growth model. For all reservoir areas combined, bioenergetics model predictions of predation on salmon were 19% lower than field estimates based on observed masses, 45% lower than estimates based on seasonal growth rates, and 15% lower than estimates based on the annual growth model. For each growth approach, the largest differences in field-versus-model predation occurred at the midreservoir area (-84% to -67% difference). Model predictions of the rate of predation on salmonids were examined for sensitivity to parameter variation, swimming speed, sampling bias caused by gear selectivity, and asymmetric size distributions of predators. The specific daily growth rate of northern pikeminnow predicted by the model was highest in July and October and decreased during August. The bioenergetics model for northern pikeminnow performed well compared with models for other fish species that have been tested with field data. This model should be a useful tool for evaluating management actions such as predator removal, examining the influence of temperature on predation rates, and exploring interactions between predators in the Columbia River basin.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	1999	128	5					784	801		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0784:DACOAB>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0784:DACOAB>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089183900002
J	Chen, ZY; Wang, ZH				Chen, ZY; Wang, ZH			Yangtze Delta, China: Taihu lake-level variation since the 1950s, response to sea-level rise and human impact	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Hydrological records collected from water gauge stations since the 1950s demonstrate that the Taihu lake level is rising. The average rate of the lake-level rise is 0.4-1.1 mm/year during the non-flood season, resulting directly from a rise in sea level. High rates of 3.0-5.0 mm/year of rise are even recorded during the wet season. This indicates increasing human activities such as reclamation, sluicing and embanking, which significantly hinder the expulsion of extra lake water to the coast shortly after a rainfall. Generally, the lake level of the western inlet is higher than that of the eastern outlet. However, the lake-level difference between the west and east has been diminished annually from similar to 10-15 cm in the 1950s to <3 cm at the present time. During non-flood seasons, the lake-level difference even appears to be reversed, indicating a retrogression of the lake flow from east to west. It is predicted that the Taihu drainage basin will lose much of its natural water-expelling ability in the next 50 years as the sea level continues to rise, and retrogression will likely occur during the flood season in the near future.

TEMPORAL CHANGES IN METALLOTHIONEIN AND METAL (CD, CU, AND ZN) CONCENTRATIONS IN SOFT-TISSUES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To test the response of the freshwater bivalve Pyganodon grandis (formerly Anodonta grandis) to increased metal exposure in the field, we transferred specimens (8 cm length; 4-6 years old) from a less to a more contaminated lake in the mining area of Rouyn-Noranda, in northwestern Quebec. The transplanted bivalves were maintained in open enclosures placed in the bottom sediments of the contaminated lake. Up to 16 individuals were removed from pairs of enclosures at times t = 0 (June 1990), 5, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 400 d; tissue concentrations of metallothionein (MT) and metals were monitored over time. Measurements on control molluscs enclosed in their lake of origin showed that enclosure per se had no apparent effect on tissue [MT] or tissue metal levels, but did decrease shell growth. Metallothionein levels in specimens transplanted to the more contaminated lake showed a slow but steady increase with time; in contrast, MT levels in the control populations showed only modest seasonal fluctuations. The increase in MT over time in the transplanted bivalves was closely correlated with a similar slow increase in soft tissue [Cd]. We conclude that MT in the freshwater bivalve P. grandis is a promising biochemical indicator of metal exposure.

Breeding grebe pairs arriving on the lake were highly attracted to several large floating cattail (Typha angustifolia) mats that had broken off and drifted away from the mainland to become "islands" snagged within rooted emergent beds. These mats provided prime nesting habitat protected from waves and predators that was chosen by nearly 40% of the breeding population. Most pairs establishing nests on the islands averaged 5-10 simultaneously active neighbors within 50 m, compared to pairs that established territories along the shoreline, most of which had no neighbors within 50 m. The overall success of the two strategies varied widely from year to year, depending on the water levels, nesting habitat availability, timing of windstorms, and predator activity. During most years, however, pairs that established nests on the mats hatched earlier in the season and had larger clutches and broods. The dense mats appeared to provide protection from wind and wave action, the primary cause of early nest loss. Our blood analysis work showed no genetic structure of the population and no tendency for neighbors to be closely related. However, pairs often returned to the same area and type of nesting situation in subsequent years. The behavioral flexibility of Red-necked Grebe pairs to nest in groups within prime habitat areas may enable them to breed successfully within unpredictable emergent wetland habitats.

Based on captures of 214 males (72 recaptures) and 99 females (40 recaptures), we generated von Bertalanffy growth equations which corroborated our growth curves based on counts of plastral growth rings and recaptured turtles. Females diverge from males in their faster growth by the end of their second season. Our oldest females were only 18-20 seasons old, and the oldest males were only 13-15 seasons old, suggesting a short generation time and a possible sexual difference in longevity. For the species, we detected no latitudinal pattern of size or age at maturity but found some support for a latitudinal increase in body size in accordance with Bergmann's Rule.																			0022-1511	1937-2418				OCT	2019	53	4					297	301		10.1670/18-052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/18-052													WOS:000505833200006

Hypotheses concerning relationships between DOC and NO(3)(-) concentrations have been proposed, but there are no reports demonstrating a relationship between them in stream water. We observed 35 natural streams in the Lake Biwa watershed, central Japan, and found an inverse relationship between DOC and NO(3)(-) concentrations. This relationship was also found in observations of their seasonal variations in the Lake Biwa watershed. Moreover, this relationship was also found to apply to watersheds in other regions in Japan. These results suggest that forest biogeochemical processes which control DOC and NO(3)(-) concentrations in Japanese streams are closely related. Excess N availability together with a C (energy) deficit in a soil environment may explain this relationship. DOC and NO(3)(-) concentrations in streams will thus be a useful index indicating C and N availability in catchments.																			0912-3814					MAY	2005	20	3					359	365		10.1007/s11284-005-0051-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-005-0051-z													WOS:000229411400013
J	Adams, CE; Maitland, PS				Adams, CE; Maitland, PS			The ruffe population of Loch Lomond, Scotland: Its introduction, population expansion, and interaction with native species	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					International Symposium on Eurasian Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) Biology, Impacts, and Control	1995	THUNDER BAY, MICHIGAN					The ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), never before recorded in Scotland, was discovered in Loch Lomond in 1982. During the 1980s ruffe became well established and expanded its range throughout the loch and through the slow-flowing influent and effluent tributaries, only being excluded from tributaries with high flow rates. Recoveries of fish entrained at a pumping station, abstracting water for domestic supply, provide a measure of the rate of population expansion between 1982 and 1996 and the current status of ruffe in Loch Lomond Between 1982 and 1992 the ruffe population grew exponentially. Since 1992 the population appears to have stabilized to some extent but at a very high level. Gill netting surveys conducted throughout Loch Lomond have shown that the high abundance of ruffe recorded at this site is representative of a large population throughout the loch. The diet of ruffe feeding in Loch Lomond differed both spatially and seasonally. Although prey choice was diverse, it was primarily composed of benthic macro-invertebrates, but at times included underyearling fish (including ruffe) and eggs of other fish species. The most important of these is the powan (Coregonus lavaretus), a broadcast spawner of national conservation value. To examine the possibility of dietary overlap with perch (Perca fluviatilis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), the diets of these three species were compared. The data showed very little evidence of overlap in diet, suggesting that feeding resource competition between ruffe and trout and ruffe and perch does not occur between adults of these species. Evidence for the disruption of predator-prey relations by introduced ruffe is reviewed. Ruffe are now the primary prey species for cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo), herons (Ardea cinerea), and northern pike (Esox lucius) feeding in Loch Lomond. Calculations based on predator population sizes and consumption rates suggest that potentially up to 17 metric tons of ruffe, representing over 2 million individuals, may be being consumed annually by these predator species. The effects on native fish of this shift in diet in these predator species is discussed, as is the ability of ecologists to predict the impact of invasions of new species in aquatic communities.																			0380-1330						1998	24	2					249	262		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70817-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70817-2													WOS:000074588400009
J	King, CE; Serra, M				King, CE; Serra, M			Seasonal variation as a determinant of population structure in rotifers reproducing by cyclical parthenogenesis	HYDROBIOLOGIA					VIIIth International Rotifer Symposium	JUN 22, 1997	ST JOHNS UNIV, COLLEGEVILLE, MN		ST JOHNS UNIV			Monogonont rotifers live in habitats that display extensively variation in both biotic and abiotic components. Much of this variation is seasonal and therefore predictable for a given pond or lake. In 1972, King proposed one physiological and two genetic models presenting alternative modes of adaptation to this temporal variation. Our purpose in the present paper is to review and evaluate how our knowledge of the seasonal structure of rotifer populations has changed in the past 25 years. Seasonal changes in clone frequencies have been reported from three studies of natural populations using electrophoretic analysis of isozymes. In one of these studies there was evidence for substantial temporal overlap of multilocus genotypes suggesting that these clones were broad-niched generalists. By contrast, both the genetic and ecological analyses in the other two studies support a non-overlap model in which clonal groups are composed of narrow-niched specialists that undergo seasonal succession. In both of these studies the clonal groups appear to have achieved the status of sibling species, a phenomenon that we conclude is probably common in monogonont rotifers. Strong competition promotes reproductive isolation between successive groups of seasonal specialists. The existence of this competition has been inferred from natural populations and demonstrated by studies in the laboratory. Also required, and also supported by field observations, is a temporal separation of periods of mictic (sexual) reproduction. A final requirement of the nonoverlap model is seasonal variation in the timing of resting egg hatching. That is, clones established from hatching of resting eggs must enter a physiologically appropriate habitat if they are to increase in number and achieve a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, we still have little information on this topic. Finally, we present the results of a study analyzing the effects of variation in the mictic ratio (i.e., the relative frequency of mictic females) on the adaptive structure of rotifer populations. Mixis may shift the balance between costs and benefits of specialization thereby producing seasonally specialized populations that overlap in space but not time. Life history patterns may therefore provide fundamental insights on the adaptation of rotifers to the extensive temporal variation in their environments.

J	Lougheed, VL; Chow-Fraser, P				Lougheed, VL; Chow-Fraser, P			Factors that regulate the zooplankton community structure of a turbid, hypereutrophic Great Lakes wetland	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We sampled zooplankton from mid-May to early September over 2 years to study the spatial and seasonal distribution of animals in a large urban wetland of Lake Ontario. Samples were from several habitat types including open water, vegetated areas, fast-flow areas, and a sewage lagoon. Mean seasonal densities ranged from 17 individuals/L (5 mu g/L) in fast-flow areas to 1800 individuals/L (1100 mu g/L) in low-flow, highly vegetated areas. All of our sites were dominated by herbivorous rotifers (e.g., Brachionus sp., Polyarthra sp., Keratella sp.), small herbivorous cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris; mean length <300 mu m), cyclopoid nauplii, and medium-sized cladocerans (e.g., Moina micrura; mean length 300-600 mu m), which were absent from the most eutrophic sites. The high levels of inorganic suspended solids in the marsh appeared to select against large filter feeders such as Daphnia and allowed smaller zooplankton to dominate. Multivariate analyses indicated that the zooplankton distribution was related to flow rate, extent of macrophyte cover, and level of site degradation. if the forthcoming carp (Cyprinus carpio) exclusion from Cootes Paradise Marsh results in increased macrophyte growth, we predict that zooplankton biomass will increase and that the zooplankton community may shift to larger forms.																			0706-652X					JAN	1998	55	1					150	161		10.1139/cjfas-55-1-150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-1-150													WOS:000072907600015

Our objectives were to estimate nitrogen cycling rates and to determine the direct (excretion) and indirect (foodweb) effects of the zebra mussel on these rates. Isotope labeling experiments with added (NH4+)-N-15 were conducted on waters collected on five sampling dates between April and October. Direct effects of zebra mussels on ammonium regeneration and potential uptake were examined by comparing results from bottles incubated with (15 individuals in 4 L lake water) and without added zebra mussels. Indirect foodweb effects were examined by measuring regeneration and potential uptake rates in subsamples of water that had previously been incubated in the presence or absence of zebra mussels. Zebra mussels removed a large fraction of chlorophyll from the oligotrophic site on all sampling dates and from the eutrophic site in October, but had a negligible effect on chlorophyll levels in waters from the eutrophic site in June, July, August, and September when cyanophytes were abundant. Community ammonium regeneration rates and uptake rates both followed seasonal patterns resembling those for chlorophyll concentrations in control treatments at the eutrophic site. Rates for water from the oligotrophic site were low (usually not significantly different from zero) and are not reported here. Community ammonium regeneration rates were consistently enhanced in the presence of zebra mussels, indicating that zebra mussel excretion could have a dominant effect on nitrogen regeneration in regions where it is abundant. Zebra mussels appeared to decrease community uptake rates of ammonium in August and September but did not predictably affect nitrogen remineralization rates by other lower foodweb organisms (e.g. bacteria, protozoans, zooplankton).

Physical factors and their influence on fish species composition in Asa Lake, Ilorin, Nigeria	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The effect of physical factors oil fish species composition was studied during 12 months in Asa Lake, Nigeria. Fish and water samples were collected bimonthly (March 2003 to February 2004) in the morning. Fish samples were caught with gill nets set at the surface and bottom habitats. There were 11 fish families and 21 species. Osteoglossidae, Anabantidae, Channidae, Schilbedae and Cyprinidae were rare and occurred seasonally in fishermen catches, while Mormyridae, Cichlidae, Mochokidae, Characidae, Bagridae and Clariidae showed less variation and Were more common. Characidae and Cichlidae were the most abundant (23.0 and 18.6% respectively) while Osteoglossidae, Channidae and Anabantidae were the least (1.7, 2.1 and 2.3% respectively). Clariidae and Mormyridae had the highest weight with 16.0% and 12.3% respectively, while Anabantidae had the lowest (3.4%). Surface water temperatures were generally higher than air temperatures during the afternoon, except from January to March when air temperatures were high (28.1 to 28.7 degrees C) doe to low relative humidity (39 to 70%). In the morning, surface water temperatures (25.5 to 263 degrees C) became higher than air temperatures (25.2 to 26.0 degrees C) from May to December, when relative humidity values were also high (50 to 88%). file differences between surface and bottom water temperatures was generally higher (0.7 to 3.1 degrees C; P < 0.05) in the afternoon (0.2 to 0.8 degrees C) due to sunlight. Temperature differences in the surface and bottom waters were usually higher during the dry season (P < 0.05), for similar reasons. captures were higher in the dry season when the fish concentrated in the warmer, steadier and scarcer Water.

J	CASSELMAN, JM				CASSELMAN, JM			GROWTH AND RELATIVE SIZE OF CALCIFIED STRUCTURES OF FISH	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The relationship between size of calcified structures and the body of fish has been used widely in fisheries science to estimate body size at a younger age by "back-calculation." I labeled the calcified tissue of northern pike Esox lucius with tetracycline to examine the concurrent linear growth of calcified structures and the body. I also conducted comparisons of the sizes of one or more calcified structures with body sizes of northern pike, lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, and muskellunge Esox masquinongy. Over a broad size and age range (juveniles and older), growth of scales, cleithra, and otoliths is only transitorily isometric in relation to body growth. Although scale growth is more strongly allometric than bone growth, allometry in both structures is positive during rapid growth and negative during slow growth. Slower-growing individuals have relatively smaller scales and cleithra. Calcified structure-body relations indicate that in older fish, growth of the scales virtually ceases while body growth continues, albeit at a greatly reduced rate as size approaches an asymptotic length. Cleithral growth in these fish, although greatly reduced, continues at a relatively greater rate than that of the scales. In contrast to scales and bones, otoliths grow relatively slower than the body during rapid growth and relatively faster than the body during slow growth. In slow-growing or old fish, otoliths grow more rapidly than the other structures and continue to record cyclic seasonal growth and age, whereas scales of these fish fail to grow in a regular fashion and can even resorb or erode and fail to provide an accurate record of age. Nutritional status, as indicated by prey are available, northern pike have relatively larger cleithra. Hence, indicator of growth and reflects subtle changes in growth rate and nutritional status.																			0002-8487					JUL	1990	119	4					673	688		10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0673:GARSOC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0673:GARSOC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1990EQ37000012
J	James, WE; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL				James, WE; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL			Phosphorus recycling by zebra mussels in relation to density and food resource availability	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Using flow-through microcosms, we examined phosphorus (P) recycling by zebra mussels under conditions of nearly constant food resource supply and varying zebra mussel population densities (600-5200 ind./m(2)). At all density levels, zebra mussels filtered substantial algae, measured as chlorophyll biomass. Because chlorophyll biomass inputs were low throughout the study, zebra mussel biomass-specific rates of chlorophyll filtration declined with increasing density, suggesting food resource limitation at the higher densities. We observed net total P export and high zebra mussel biomass-specific rates of P recycling over time in microcosms at high zebra mussel densities. In systems with a low zebra mussel density, net total P export did not occur over time. Our results suggest the occurrence of P remineralization by zebra mussels and net loss associated with emaciation during periods of temporary starvation. These findings have implications for P dynamics since zebra mussels can be subjected to periods of starvation over seasonal and annual time scales.																			0018-8158					JUL 1	2001	455						55	60		10.1023/A:1011935317815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011935317815													WOS:000173247400005

In this study, twenty sites were selected in a shallow man-made lake and its surrounding canals in Shanghai, China. We examined monthly phytoplankton assemblages during 2010-2012, with the use of cluster and ordination analysis, to identify phytoplankton assemblages patterns. Our results indicated that phytoplankton assemblages varied along a gradient of turbidity and nutrients. The large canal with ample nutrients and high turbidity was dominated by diatoms (e.g., Navicula cryptocephala). Flagellates (e.g., Cryptomonas erosa, Chlamydomonas globosa and Euglena oxyuris) dominated in the canals with the decreased nutrient and turbidity. Dinoflagellates (e.g., Gymnodinium sp.) were abundant in the lake. The lake experienced drastic changes in physico-chemical conditions since its creation in 2003, such as desalination and nutrient enrichment. Phytoplankton assemblages trajectories followed environmental changes closely. A relatively stable seasonal cyclic character in the phytoplankton development was observed in lake during 2010-2012. These results suggested that local environmental constraints can be strong enough to structure local phytoplankton assemblages in this highly interconnected system.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2015	49	2					147	157		10.1007/s10452-015-9511-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-015-9511-x													WOS:000354612800002

Inorganic material dominated the trap collections and caused a decoupling of the downward fluxes of Chl and PP because of major contributions of inorganic components to P deposition. These contributions were manifested in the stoichiometry of trap collections, the much higher estimates of settling velocity (SV) for PP compared with Chl, and differences in patterns of Chl and PP deposition within individual reservoirs and among these systems. Most of the deposited phosphorus in these reservoirs (71-98%) was associated with nonphytoplankton particles. In contrast to the other constituents, the estimates of SV for Chl were lower and more uniform; nearly 50% of the individual estimates (n = 188) were between 0.15 and 0.25 m.day(-1). Longitudinal gradients in sediment deposition occurred as a result of gradients in both overlying water concentrations and settling characteristics of the particles. Seasonal and vertical patterns in trap collections and budget calculations indicate that resuspension contributed to deposition, to varying extents, in all of the reservoir basins.																			0706-652X					NOV	2001	58	11					2177	2188		10.1139/cjfas-58-11-2177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-11-2177													WOS:000172266700009

The radioactively labeled probe was used to detect S. putrefaciens in field samples collected from the water column and sediments of Oneida Lake in New York and its major southern tributary, Chittenango Creek. S. putrefaciens was quantified by (i) hybridization of the probe to bulk RNA extracted from field samples and normalization of the S. putrefaciens-specific rRNA to total eubacterial rRNA, (ii) a colony-based probe hybridization assay, and (iii) a colony-based biochemical assay which detected the formation of iron sulfide precipitates on triple-sugar iron agar. The results of field applications indicated that the three detection methods were comparable in sensitivity for detecting S. putrefaciens in water column and sediment samples. S. putrefaciens rRNA was detected in the surficial layers of the lake and creek sediments, but the levels of S. putrefaciens rRNA were below the detection limits in the lake and creek water samples. The highest concentrations of S. putrefaciens rRNA, corresponding to approximately 2% of the total eubacterial rRNA, were detected in the surficial sediments of Chittenango Creek and at a midlake site where the Oneida Lake floor is covered by a high concentration of ferromanganese nodules. This finding supports the hypothesis that metal-reducing bacteria such as S. putrefaciens are important components in the overall biogeochemical cycling of iron, manganese and other elements in seasonally anoxic freshwater basins.																			0099-2240					DEC	1993	59	12					4152	4160		10.1128/AEM.59.12.4152-4160.1993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.59.12.4152-4160.1993								7506899					WOS:A1993MK85400024
J	Norton, SA; Cosby, BJ; Fernandez, IJ; Kahl, JS; Church, MR				Norton, SA; Cosby, BJ; Fernandez, IJ; Kahl, JS; Church, MR			Long-term and seasonal variations in CO2:: linkages to catchment alkalinity generation	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												As atmospheric emissions of S have declined in the Northern Hemisphere, there has been an expectation of increased pH and alkalinity in streams believed to have been acidified by excess S and N. Many streams and lakes have not recovered. Evidence from East Bear Brook in Maine, USA and modelling with the groundwater acid-base model MAGIC (Cosby et al. 1985a,b) indicate that seasonal and yearly variations in soil PCO2 are adequate to enhance or even reverse acid-base (alkalinity) changes anticipated from modest decreases of SO4 in surface waters. Alkalinity is generated in the soil by exchange of H+ from dissociation of H2CO3, which in turn is derived from the dissolving of soil CO2. The variation in soil PCO2 produces an alkalinity variation of up to 15 mu eq L-1 in stream water. Detecting and relating increases in alkalinity to decreases in stream SO4 are significantly more difficult in the short term because of this effect. For example, modelled alkalinity recovery at Bear Brook due to a decline of 20 mu eq SO4 L-1 in soil solution is compensated by a decline from 0.4 to 0.2% for soil air PCO2. This compensation ability decays over time as base saturation declines. Variable PCO2 has less effect in more acidic soils. Short-term decreases of PCO2 below the long-term average value produce short-term decreases in alkalinity, whereas short-term increases in PCO2 produce shortterm alkalization. Trend analysis for detecting recovery of streams and lakes from acidification after reduced atmospheric emissions will require a longer monitoring period for statistical significance than previously appreciated.

NESTING ECOLOGY OF THE GREY-HEADED FISH-EAGLE AT PREK TOAL, TONLE SAP LAKE, CAMBODIA	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												Little is known about the ecology of the Grey-headed Fish-Eagle (GHFE; Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus) despite it being a globally near-threatened species in apparent decline. We here present the first quantitative information on nesting ecology of this species, in a regionally significant population at Prek Toal, part of the seasonally flooded swamp forest surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia. We found that GHFE selected trees as nest sites that had an open crown structure and were relatively tall. Grey-headed Fish-Eagles preferred nesting closer to permanent water than expected, but the timing of breeding did not differ according to distance to permanent water: we suggest that their preference for nests near water may reflect an advantage based on prey availability. Water snakes, known prey of GHFE, were significantly more abundant at a site in permanent water than at a temporarily flooded site, in December. We also found that human habitation was negatively correlated to GHFE nest-site occupancy rates. This may reflect indirect. effects of human exploitation of GHFE food supplies, which may be exacerbated in the future by changes to the Tonle Sap ecosystem resulting from upstream dam construction.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				SEP	2010	44	3					165	174		10.3356/JRR-09-04.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-09-04.1													WOS:000281630500001
J	Meyers, PA				Meyers, PA			Evidence of mid-Holocene climate instability from variations in carbon burial in Seneca Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The amounts and types of carbon delivered to the sediments Seneca Lake, New York, have varied since the middle Holocene. Concentrations of CaCO(3) first fluctuate between 14 and 6% around 7 ka before decreasing erratically until about 5 ka and then remain 2% in younger sediments. Because the amount of calcite that precipitates in hard-water lakes is related to summertime thermal stratification, the carbonate fluctuations suggest that cyclic strengthening and weakening of seasonality at intervals of about three centuries accompanied the end of the Holocene Hypsithermal in northeast North America. Organic C/total N values record short, decade-long intervals of enhanced delivery of land-plant material during episodes of wetter climate that are independent of the temperature variations. Higher organic delta(13)C values indicate that recent fertilization of lake waters from soil disturbance and land-derived runoff has increased aquatic productivity.

The dramatic long-term water level variation of the Dead Sea and the seasonal short-term fluctuations are accompanied by parallel variations of groundwater levels in an adjacent aquifer. A general methodology based on a simplified yet reliable one-dimensional flow model, together with continuous measurements of groundwater levels in observation wells, enables analysis of aquifer structural and hydraulic properties. Furthermore, this analysis enables prediction of future groundwater levels in unconfined and confined aquifers due to future changes in lake levels.

J	RAVEN, JA				RAVEN, JA			IMPLICATIONS OF INORGANIC CARBON UTILIZATION - ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND GEOCHEMISTRY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												CO2-concentrating mechanisms based on active inorganic C influx across a membrane (or membranes) are widespread in aquatic phototrophs. They are apparently absent from, or poorly developed in, taxa such as bryophytes and freshwater red algae, but are retained in some terrestrial phototrophs, i.e., some lichens and free-living algae and cyanobacteria related to the lichen photobionts. The natural occurrence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms is negatively correlated with CO2 enrichment of aquatic habitats from respiration of organic C produced elsewhere and, less clearly, with low temperatures during the growing season, with low external pH, and with rapid water movement over the plant surface. Predictions based on laboratory data and on theoretical considerations as to the influence of light, nitrogen, and iron availability on the occurrence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms have yet to be rigorously tested in the field. The evolution of CO2-concentrating mechanisms is not well understood, but clearly the location of inorganic C pumps must have been influenced by successive symbiotic events. Increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, and other anthropogenic effects (acidification, eutrophication), may influence the selective advantage (or disadvantage) associated with possession of CO2-concentrating mechanisms in particular environments.

During the 12 months study period, a total of 4 696 flies was individually dissected to examine the monthly transmission potential (MTP) of O. ochengi and O. volvulus. The estimated Simulium damnosum s.l. annual biting rates (ABR) on human baits were 47 529 flies at the bank of the Vina "du sud" river. The ABR at the lake, which was situated at about 2 km upland from the perennial river, was 8 579. The monthly parous rate was highly correlated with monthly biting rate. The annual transmission potentials (ATP) of O. ochengi were calculated to be 7 732 and 1 669 at the riverbank and the lake, respectively. Transmission occurred mainly in the dry season, peaking in the months of January to mid-March when dermal microfilaria density in the animals was also the highest. The O. ochengi microfilaria uptake by the fly vectors was host microfilaria density-dependent. The MTP of O. ochengi was positively correlated with dermal microfilaria density. The mean number of microfilariae per fly taken up during a blood meal was high during the dry season as was the mean number of infective larvae per fly but declined significantly with the onset of the early rains. A similar seasonality of transmission was also observed for O. volvulus that was concurrently transmitted by the same vector flies, but its ATP was comparatively much lower: 1 332 infective larvae per man per year at the riverbank and 107 around the lake. The population dynamics of cattle microfilariae therefore plays an important role in the regulation of O. ochengi transmission.					; Renz, Alfons/ABC-4204-2021	Renz, Alfons/0000-0002-7846-488X; 													0928-4249	1297-9716				NOV-DEC	2000	31	6					611	621		10.1051/vetres:2000144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/vetres:2000144								11129804					WOS:000165524300007

R. China. The two villages are the focus of this paper, the experimental Jishan Village and the control Hexi Village. The prevalence and intensity of infection of humans and buffaloes were determined. Then, all inhabitants of all the villages were treated with praziquantel, while only the buffaloes of the experimental (intervention) village were treated. Following treatment, rates of re-infection of people in the two villages and buffaloes in the experimental village, as well as the ongoing prevalence of infections in the buffaloes of the control village were monitored annually. Quantitative collections of snails were made pre- and post-flood for a total of nine seasons to determine the density of snails, density of infected snails, and prevalence of infected snails. Collections were made from ecologically different village zones and from hot spots for persistent snail infections within zones. The hypothesis was that treatments in the experimental village would drive down snail infections to 80% or more below pre-trial levels. This paper makes the case that the intervention did not achieve reducing snail infections village-wide by even 50% or more. The probable reasons for this failure are discussed. The significant findings of this longitudinal study are several: (1) Foremost, the intervention did not achieve the goal of significantly reducing snail infections in Jishan. (2) To understand the dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum transmission throughout large areas, such as the administrative villages of Hexi and Jishan, it is important to partition the area into clearly definable ecological zones. (3) We have found that the greatest risk of infection is in very small areas within zones that we call hot spots. (4) The most important indicator for risk of infection is the density of infected snails, not the prevalence. (5) There are very significantly more infected snails per area in hot spots than in non-hot spots. (6) Density of infected snails is not correlated with density of snails overall. (7) The sampling strategy of zones, squares, and random selection of 20 4 m(2) cells within squares has enabled robust statistical analyses of snail populations that have a strong negative binomial distribution. Sampling twice a year (before the floods and after the floods) for at least 8 or 9 seasons has provided a time series enabling a robust assessment of trends in the experimental and control villages. Paying close attention to environmental factors as they impact results is critical.					; Williams, Gail/S-8833-2019; McManus, Don/AAC-5394-2020	Williams, Gail/0000-0002-4822-5263; McManus, Donald/0000-0001-6443-1449													0076-2997	2168-9075					2006	49	1					79	105		10.4002/1543-8120-49.1.79	http://dx.doi.org/10.4002/1543-8120-49.1.79													WOS:000242021500005

Declining returns to Redfish Lake in the 1980s prompted the National Marine Fisheries Service to list Snake River sockeye salmon as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, and a multi-agency effort was initiated in 1991 to prevent their extinction. The recovery effort focused on the development of a captive broodstock coupled with evaluation and enhancement of nursery lake habitats. Large populations of nonendemic kokanee salmon O. nerka and the oligotrophic conditions of these lakes raised concerns about overstocking sockeye salmon and causing the collapse of macrozooplankton populations. To minimize these risks and to improve sockeye salmon forage production, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes initiated a 4-year nutrient enrichment program in Redfish Lake. Liquid fertilizer (20:1, N:P by wt) was added weekly during the growing season from 1995 to 1998 to the surface of Redfish Lake with Stanley Lake (unfertilized) acting as a control. During the fertilization of Redfish Lake, Secchi depth decreased by 13% and compensation depth by 24%, while increases were observed for surface chlorophyll a (106%) and primary production (117%). Uniformity of phytoplankton communities throughout the experiment indicated that the Redfish Lake food web was efficient (without major carbon sinks) and improved forage conditions for macrozooplankton. Total macrozooplankton biomass increased 31%, and Daphnia spp. biomass increased by 225%, simultaneous to a 26% increase in O. nerka density. Also, during fertilization, overwinter survival of supplemented sockeye salmon increased 192% in Redfish Lake. However, meteorological conditions were partly responsible for these changes. In unfertilized Stanley Lake, during the same time periods, Secchi depth declined 27%, and compensation depth was reduced by 28%; chlorophyll a increased 16%, primary production increased 14%, and zooplankton biomass was stable. These changes highlight the importance of climate (meteorological forcing) and the need for a control when attempting to identify impacts from lake fertilization. Disproportionately larger increases in Redfish Lake chlorophyll a, primary productivity, and zooplankton biomass relative to observed changes in Stanley Lake provide evidence for the efficacy of nutrient supplementation in Redfish Lake.

We present trends information for 36 lakes of high-to-moderate acid sensitivity (defined as acid neutralizing capacity [ANC] < 100 mu eq L-1), and 15 deposition monitoring stations, in the northeastern U.S. for the period 1982-1994. Trends at each site were assessed through use of the Seasonal Kendall tau test; the resulting statistics were combined, through a technique analogous to analysis of variance, to produce quasi-regional estimates of change for key chemical variables. Rates of sulfate deposition declined significantly across all of the northeastern region during this time period, while rates of nitrate and ammonium deposition were unchanged. All lakes exhibited strong decreases in sulfate concentrations (Delta SO(4)2- = -1.7 mu eq L(-1)yr(-1), p<0.001) in response to declining sulfate deposition, but there was a strong contrast in the response of acid/base status between lakes in New England and lakes in the Adirondacks. As a group, the New England lakes exhibited recovery (Delta ANC = +0.8 mu eq L(-1)yr(-1), p<0.001), while the Adirondack lakes exhibited either no trend or further acidification (as a group, Delta ANC = -0.5 mu eq L(-1)yr(-1), p<0.01). This contrast can be attributed to changes in base cation concentrations: New England lakes exhibited base cations declines that were smaller in magnitude than declines in sulfate, producing the observed recovery in ANC; Adirondack lakes showed base cation declines that were very similar to those of sulfate, and no recovery was evident.					; Driscoll, Charles/F-9832-2014; Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014; Stoddard, John/H-5594-2013	Stoddard, John/0000-0002-2537-6130; Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; 													0167-6369					JUN	1998	51	1-2					399	413		10.1023/A:1005988732077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005988732077													WOS:000073346600032

Most of the diet of L. pardalis and P. nigricans was made of amorphous organic matter. The food ingested by L. pardalis had relatively higher organic matter (OM) (35-55%) and crude protein (10-19%) than that found in P. nigricans stomachs (10-20% and 2-5%, respectively). Both fish ingested higher quantities of OM and crude protein during the high-water season, The differences between the two species seem to be related to their ability to select different detrital components. Striking differences were also found in the digestibility rate of OM and protein between the two species. Prochilodus nigricans assimilated only 2.3% of its intake compared with 24% in L. pardalis.

We used coupled multivariate and univariate analyses to find whether the zooplankton community had changed over these decades, and to determine if such changes had occurred consistently across all stations. Seasonal variation was also examined. We found that the structure of the zooplankton community changed in directions predicted by the concurrent increase in the abundance of a major endemic planktivore, the lake herring (Coregonus artedi). The presence and abundance of various species in different habitats also varied within a year, between years, and between decades. The spatiotemporal scale of this study confirms that size-selective planktivory may produce community-wide effects in large lakes.

Ovigerous females and small juveniles were found in all seasons. In males, no significant seasonal differences in testis size were found. However, the percentage of ovigerous females was distinctly lower in the dry, cool season (April-October). This indicates reproductive activity in L. verticillatus during the whole year, with a rather weakly marked seasonality that results in lower incidence of reproduction during the dry season. Most females dissected had two eggs or follicles of similar size in their oviducts, and only in 5% of the specimens did one oviduct contain a mature egg or a follicle of distinctly larger size than the other oviduct. A clutch size of two eggs therefore seems to prevail in this species, despite its small size (the range of adult female snout-vent lengths was 20-27mm). According to the available literature data, continuous or weakly seasonal reproduction seems to be more common in geckos than in other lizards, which might be related to the constraint of their low clutch size (1-2 eggs).

Nets captured a total of 449 fish consisting of striped bass (57%/45% [Lake Powell/Lake Mead]), threadfin shad (24%/50%), common carp (15%/4%), walleye (3%), channel catfish (2%), and rainbow front (<1%). Each reservoir contained concentrations of pelagic species separated by expanses of habitat with few fish (<10 kg.ha(-1)). Reservoirs experienced dramatic seasonal and annual fluctuations in pelagic biomass. Lake Powell's biomass peaked at the Colorado River at 709.7 (+/-46.5) kg.ha(-1) and Lake Mead's reached 291.9 (+/-58.2) kg.ha(-1) at Las Vegas Wash. These locations supported estimated fish densities of 124,668 fish.ha(-1) and 15,131 fish.ha(-1), respectively. Maximum reservoir biomass peaked in August 1996, with Lake Powell supporting 10,852,738+/-5,195,556 kg (27.6x10(7) fish) and Lake Mead 1,926,697+/-892.994 kg (10.8x10(7) fish).

J	BRANDT, SB; KIRSCH, J				BRANDT, SB; KIRSCH, J			SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MODELS OF STRIPED BASS GROWTH-POTENTIAL IN CHESAPEAKE BAY	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Fish growth rate potential is defined as the expected growth rate of a predator if placed in a particular volume of water having known physical and biological characteristics. We used the concept of fish growth rate potential to evaluate the seasonal and spatial growth patterns of striped bass Morone saxatilis across a midsection of the Chesapeake Bay. The growth rate potential of a 4-year-old (1.9-kg) striped bass was assessed by integrating spatially explicit field data on prey sizes, prey densities, and water temperature with a foraging model and a species-specific bioenergetics model of fish growth rate. Prey sizes and densities were measured bimonthly at a high spatial resolution along a west-east transect of the bay with a 120-kHz dual-beam acoustic system. Along the transect, the water column was divided by columns and rows into a grid of cells 30 m long and 0.5 m deep. Growth and foraging models were implemented in each cell to calculate expected striped bass growth rate. Two-dimensional (horizontal, vertical) spatial maps of striped bass growth potential showed strong seasonal differences, even though overall prey biomass was similar from month to month. Striped bass growth rates were highest during October and nil during August. Mean growth rate potentials across the bay derived from the spatially explicit model were lower in all months than estimates generated with cross-bay, spatial averages of prey density. We argue that such spatially explicit modeling is necessary for directly linking biological function to physical and biological structure and for predicting how spatial patterning and absolute scaling of the habitat affect fish growth rates and production.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	1993	122	5					845	869		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0845:SEMOSB>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0845:SEMOSB>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993MJ44000018

Mohamed; Scott, Kenneth A.; Wissel, Bjoern			Water chemistry, landscape, and spatial controls of δ13C and δ15N of zooplankton taxa in boreal lakes: One size does not fit all	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios of zooplankton are potentially good indicators of energy and nutrient fluxes, and trophic interactions in lake food-webs, yet, are poorly understood. Based on a synoptic survey of 233 boreal lakes, we evaluated the relationships of water chemistry, hydromorphological, and land cover variables (lake/catchment-specific factors), and the spatial position of lakes in the landscape (representing potential regional factors) with the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of nine meso-zooplankton taxa. The delta C-13 variation of most taxa was negatively related to water chemistry variables associated with allochthonous inputs (colour/dissolved organic carbon), and positively correlated with nutrient concentrations (together explaining 12-69% of variation). Most of the delta C-13 variation explained by significant hydromorphological and land cover variables (% peat area, drainage basin area:lake area, shoreline development index, and lake area, explaining 26-47% of variation) was shared by significant water chemistry variables. Together, this suggests that delta C-13 variation of zooplankton reflects different environmental influences on delta C-13 of lake primary producers. The delta N-15 variation of most taxa was significantly related to pH, total phosphorous concentration (water chemistry variables, explaining 8-64% of variation), and water retention time (hydromorphological variable, explaining 13-87% of variation). These relationships are probably reflective of the association of zooplankton delta N-15 with terrestrial organic matter flux, environmentally-induced biogeochemical nitrogen transformations and phytoplankton N-15 fractionation. Specific water chemistry, hydromorphological, and land cover predictors of delta C-13 and delta N-15 and the direction of their effects (i.e. positive or negative) were largely similar among taxa. However, their degree of importance varied among taxa particularly for delta C-13, probably due to contrasting feeding selectivity and resulting differences in allochthony. This suggests that delta C-13 of different taxa may respond differently to changes in limnological gradients due to environmental perturbations affecting boreal regions. The lake/catchment-specific factors were more important than regional factors (lithology, soil properties and atmospheric nitrogen deposition; which are represented by the spatial position of lakes) in explaining delta C-13 and delta N-15 variation of zooplankton. Hence, before inferring regional effects in stable isotope studies, the influence of lake/catchment-specific factors needs to be explicitly quantified.

Relating groundwater to seasonal wetlands in southeastern Wisconsin, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Historically, drier types of wetlands have been difficult to characterize and are not well researched. Nonetheless, they are considered to reflect the precipitation history with little, if any, regard for possible relation to groundwater. Two seasonal coastal wetland types ( wet prairie, sedge meadow) were investigated during three growing seasons at three sites in the Lake Michigan Basin, Wisconsin, USA. The six seasonal wetlands were characterized using standard soil and vegetation techniques and groundwater measurements from the shallow and deep systems. They all met wetland hydrology criteria ( e. g., water within 30 cm of land surface for 5% of the growing season) during the early portion of the growing season despite the lack of appreciable regional groundwater discharge into the wetland root zones. Although root-zone duration analyses did not fit a lognormal distribution previously noted in groundwater-dominated wetlands, they were able to discriminate between the plant communities and showed that wet prairie communities had shorter durations of continuous soil saturation than sedge meadow communities. These results demonstrate that the relative rates of groundwater outflows can be important for wetland hydrology and resulting wetland type. Thus, regional stresses to the shallow groundwater system such as pumping or low Great Lake levels can be expected to affect even drier wetland types.																			1431-2174					FEB	2009	17	1					215	228		10.1007/s10040-008-0345-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-008-0345-7													WOS:000262971600017

J	Phiri, H; Shirakihara, K				Phiri, H; Shirakihara, K			Distribution and seasonal movement of pelagic fish in southern Lake Tanganyika	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The distribution and seasonal movement of two planktivorous clupeids, Stolothrissa tanganicae and Limnothrissa miodon, and one predatory centropomid fish, Lates stappersi in the southern end (Zambian waters) of Lake Tanganyika were studied using purse seine fishery statistics and species ratio data collected between 1984 and 1992. L. stappersi is the most abundant offshore among the three species and moves northwards into waters of other countries during the dry season. L. miodon occupies the inshore regions of the lake, and does not appear to move offshore beyond Zambian waters. S. tanganicae is more dominant in the offshore waters than L. miodon and there is a strong possibility that it moves out of the Zambian waters. The presence or absence of the predator, L. stappersi, seems to affect the distribution of the two prey clupeid species. Species-based management of either clupeid, which are captured together, may not be meaningful but an assumption of close-equivalent population in the wet season may be useful in implementing seasonal regulations. International management policies may have to be introduced for L. stappersi. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Mackay, D; Bentzen, E				Mackay, D; Bentzen, E			The role of the atmosphere in Great Lakes contamination	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Certain implications are discussed of the data in a recent report of atmospheric deposition rates to the Great Lakes by Hoff et al. (Atmospheric Environment 30, 3505-3527, 1996). An analysis of the data suggests that for many persistent, volatile organic chemicals concentrations in water are close to a state of long term (several years, within a factor of approximately five) equilibrium with the atmosphere, but are in a constant state of short-term seasonal adjustment. Under these near-equilibrium conditions the actual magnitude of air to water loadings become relatively unimportant as determinants of lake ecosystem contamination, and the significance of land-based loadings is reduced. Success in decontaminating or restoring the Great Lakes is becoming increasingly dependent on atmospheric concentrations and thus on the processes which determine these concentrations.

J	Malta, EJ; Verschuure, JM				Malta, EJ; Verschuure, JM			Effects of environmental variables on between-year variation of Ulva growth and biomass in a eutrophic brackish lake	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Biomass development, growth rate, tissue composition and habitat characteristics of macroalgal blooms were monitored in the eutrophic Veerse Meer (the Netherlands) in 1992 and in 1994 to determine seasonal and between-year variabilities and their relation with environmental factors. In both years, the blooms were dominated by Ulva species (more than 95% of total macroalgal biomass). In 1992, the maximum biomass was 602 g DW m(-2), in 1994 the maximum biomass was only 282 g DW m(-2). Growth rates (mu), measured in cages, were high at the beginning of May 1992, but quickly dropped to values between 0.05 and 0.10 day(-1). In 1994, high growth rates were observed for 1 week in early May only. Water nitrogen concentrations (DIN) and tissue nitro en levels in Ulva spp. were higher in 1994 than in 1992. No overall difference was found in irradiance between 1992. and 1994 at the beginning of the growing season, bur irradiance levels were much higher in 1992. The results of a stepwise multiple regression analysis indicate that in 1992 the part of variation in growth rate that could be explained by regression was due to water DIN. In 1994, water phosphorus concentration and light were the variables explaining this part of the variation in growth rate. It is concluded that macroalgal biomass development in the Veerse Meer shows high variability, both within one season and between years. Although positive correlations were shown between tissue nitrogen levels and DIN, differences in DIN could not explain between-year variability. In a eutrophic lagoon, incident irradiance levels are probably more important in regulating maximum macroalgal yield than DIN.					; Malta, Erik-jan/AAK-5662-2020	Malta, Erik-jan/0000-0002-3934-3807; 													1385-1101					DEC	1997	38	1-2					71	84		10.1016/S1385-1101(97)00039-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1385-1101(97)00039-7													WOS:000071269300006

There are several problems concerning the protection and assessment of water quality of these bodies. The most important features differentiating coastal lakes from other lakes are: high salinity, a wide range of seasonal and short-term water quality changes, and specific aquatic ecosystems adapted to these conditions. These matters have not been sufficiently taken into account in the existing classifications and typologies of lakes in Poland. The problem has not been solved by the establishment of the adequate reference conditions and new guidelines for the classification of water status (which are being prepared according to the Common Strategy for the Implementation of the Water Framework Directive) regarding inland surface waters (rivers and lakes) and marine waters (coastal and transitional). An important issue is to define criteria which would help to distinguish all those hydrographic objects and to establish water quality standards for them.					; Cieslinski, Roman/A-5427-2008	Cieslinski, Roman/0000-0002-5313-1923; Major, Maciej/0000-0002-5424-919X													1895-6572	1895-7455				AUG	2012	60	4					1159	1179		10.2478/s11600-012-0018-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11600-012-0018-8													WOS:000305241000009

Numbers of ammonia-oxidisers (MPN) in the Windermere lakewater were low (< 100 cells ml(-1)) throughout the year with the exception of peaks in August, which coincided with stratification, and November in the South Basin where overturn may have introduced ammonia-oxidising bacteria into the water column. Sediment samples contained larger populations of ammonia oxidisers, usually ca. 10(4) per g. dry weight, which remained relatively constant throughout the seasonal cycle in both Basins. DNA was recovered from lakewater and sediment samples and Nitrosospira and N. europaea-eutropha lineage16S rRNA genes amplified in a nested PCR reaction, with confirmation of identity by oligonucleotide hybridisation. Nitrosospira 16S rDNA was readily detected in all samples and therefore found to be ubiquitous. In contrast, nitrosomonad DNA of the N. europaea-eutropha lineage could only be detected in the oligotrophic North Basin. Enrichment cultures of lakewater samples only exhibited nitrification at low (0.67 mM) and medium (5 mM) ammonium concentrations, whilst sediment enrichments nitrified at all concentrations tested including high (12.5 mM) ammonium medium. These data suggest that ammonia-oxidiser populations may be physiologically distinguished between lakewater and sediment, and that species distribution in a single lake is non-uniform.					; Saunders, Jonathan/B-5884-2011	Pickup, Roger William/0000-0002-9469-1724; Whitby, Corinne/0000-0003-1998-2748; 													0003-6072	1572-9699				JUN	2001	79	2					179	188		10.1023/A:1010202211368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010202211368								11520004					WOS:000170047400010
J	Rossi, L; Costantini, ML				Rossi, L; Costantini, ML			Mapping the intra-habitat variation of leaf mass loss rate in a brackish Mediterranean lake	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To study patterns of spatio-temporal variation of both leaf breakdown and interactions between leaf-associated detritivores and fungi, we mapped the variation of the mass loss rate of Phragmites australis in a brackish Mediterranean lake. We carried out the study at 20 sampling points randomly chosen on a 400 m(2) grid on the bottom of Lake Alimini, using litterbags which contained reed leaves. The mass loss from litterbags after 30 d, leaf-colonizing animals, and the microbial activity on the reed litter were assessed seasonally over a year in each sampling site. Half of the litterbags were protected from animal colonisation and used to determine the mass loss due solely to microbial activity and abiotic factors. The benthic detritivores colonizing the remaining litterbags were collected and sorted by their functional group. Microbial respiration on protected and unprotected Litterbags and the sediment organic content were measured at each sampling site and related to Litter mass loss. Comparisons of mass loss and microbial oxygen consumption between protected and unprotected litterbags indicated that leaf processing was affected by the grazing activity of detritivores on microflora. Hydrological conditions and the potential Litter distribution influenced detritivore occurrence which, in turn, controlled the litter processing. The observed between-site variance in the reed mass loss showed that, beside the rate, spatial variation is an important process feature in the habitat description. Geostatistics based on either the average values or the temporal variation of the mass loss rate provided 2 different, statistically validated lake topographies. However the latter was more convenient for outlining site differences within the lake. The extent of reed cover along the shore, as well as variable freshwater and nutrient inputs, determined the intra-habitat variability. We suggest an index (RL), integrating 3 critical factors for the allochthonous detritus processing (i.e. distance, sinuosity, and plant cover of the shore), as an indirect estimate of the rate of detritus mass loss. This can facilitate the approach to the functional geography of aquatic ecosystems.

Evolutionary stasis despite selection on a heritable trait in an invasive zooplankton	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Invasive species are one of the greatest threats to ecosystems, and there is evidence that evolution plays an important role in the success or failure of invasions. Yet, few studies have measured natural selection and evolutionary responses to selection in invasive species, particularly invasive animals. We quantified the strength of natural selection on the defensive morphology (distal spine) of an invasive zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lake Michigan across multiple months during three growing seasons. We used multiple lines of evidence, including historic and contemporary wild-captured individuals and palaeoecology of retrieved spines, to assess phenotypic change in distal spine length since invasion. We found evidence of temporally variable selection, with selection for decreased distal spine length early in the growing season and selection for increased distal spine length later in the season. This trend in natural selection is consistent with seasonal changes in the relative strength of non-gape-limited and gape-limited fish predation. Yet, despite net selection for increased distal spine length and a known genetic basis for distal spine length, we observed little evidence of an evolutionary response to selection. Multiple factors likely limit an evolutionary response to selection, including genetic correlations, trade-offs between components of fitness, and phenotypic plasticity.

The first appearance of ostracods, around 4 000 cal. yr BP, reflects the switch from a very dilute lake during the mid-Holocene, to slightly oligosaline conditions that favoured the occurrence and preservation of ostracods. Between 3 800 and 3 100 cal. yr BP, the lake remained permanent and fresh or slightly oligosaline, with a Ca-Mg-HCO3 composition. A rise in salinity c. 3 100 cal. yr BP, accompanied by a change to more variable conditions on a seasonal to interannual timescale, led to the influx of more-euryhaline taxa. Oligosaline conditions continued between 3 100 and 1 500 cal. yr BP Around 1 500 cal. yr BP, there was a sharp rise in salinity, probably accompanied by a shift to Na-CO3-type water, with marked seasonal and interannual variability. Salinity decreased after 900 cal. yr BP, although short-term variations were marked between 900 cal. yr BP and the top of the sequence, 95 cal. yr BP. Changes in the species assemblages and ostracod abundance were a response to climate-driven variations in the seasonal and interannual stability of the lake, together with changes in its salinity and solute composition, but there is no simple relationship between ostracod faunas and salinity. Within Kajemarum, there is no evidence of ostracod assemblages typical of deep, fresh water, nor of hypersaline Na-Cl waters. The sediments associated with the freshest waters at Kajemarum did not favour ostracod preservation, and the driest climatic conditions were associated with oligosaline to mesosaline water of Na-CO3-type. The species-poor assemblages reflect the short-term instability of the lake, coupled with the limited opportunities for the colonisation of this isolated basin.																			0921-2728					DEC	1998	20	4					369	380		10.1023/A:1007923304411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007923304411													WOS:000078591000005

The sediments studied here represent a depositional system developed from the margin to the centre of the basin by alluvial fan, mud flat and saline mud flat/ephemeral lacustrine environments. An assemblage of authigenic lithotypes was formed in the basin, their distribution being influenced by that of the depositional environments within the basin. Authigenesis took place mainly before sedimentation of the next set of beds. In the distal alluvial fan, authigenesis of smectite (outer part), palygorskite (inner part) and calcrete predominates, and the original muddy deposits are still recognizable. In the mud flat, a more intense transformation of the sediments took place, with predominant formation of palygorskite (outer part), interstitial gypsum, calcrete (outer part), dolocrete (inner part) and brown silcrete. In the saline mud flat/ephemeral lake, original sediment was extensively disturbed and replaced by magnesian clays (sepiolite and magnesian smectite), interstitial gypsum, dolocrete and cream and white silcrete. Authigenic alteration within each cycle varied in time and place, and was both pedogenic and groundwater-related. The authigenic assemblages point to a closed basin under evaporation in a seasonally dry climate. At the end of this period the SAB became connected with the Duero Basin to the northeast, thus losing the endoreic regime. Consequently, the authigenic evaporitic assemblages were then unstable and were partially replaced by a late sparry calcrete.

To clarify when and how the ice-ridge line built up, meteorology and ice and water temperatures were monitored, and the density, thermal conductivity, and thickness of the covered ice were measured from January through March 1995. The covered ice on 4 and 5 March 1995, which corresponded to the period with the thickest lake ice, consisted of snow ice 0.05- to 0.07-m thick and candle ice 0.18- to 0.21-m thick. Numerical simulations for the ice thickness and temperature were carried out using a one-dimensional, unsteady, three-layer model. The simulated results, which were reasonable to the observations, indicate that due to the ice contraction and expansion, the ice-ridge line started to construct on 2 February and was completed the next day.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2010	11	2					125	132		10.1007/s10201-009-0298-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0298-0													WOS:000278932000004

Enhancing the fish production potential of Lake Victoria papyrus wetlands, Kenya, using seasonal flood-dependent ponds	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We present the findings of a participatory experiment on integrated aquaculture-agriculture systems (Fingerponds) at the Lake Victoria wetlands, Kenya. Fingerponds are flood-based lacustrine or floodplain wetland fishponds. The aim of the study was to explore, within a wetland/floodplain interface environment, the potential of semi-intensive fish production to enhance the wetland fishery and protect the natural ecosystem from wide-scale, destructive encroachment. The ponds were stocked naturally by flood water. After flood recession, livestock manure was added to the ponds and the effects of manuring on water and sediment quality and fish yields were studied. Manuring had positive effects on the nitrogen, phosphorous and chlorophyll a concentrations of the pond water. Regression analysis results indicated that site, manuring and environmental and climatic variables explained 58-70% of the variation in dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous, and 71% of the variation in chorophyll a. Manuring enhanced the total phosphorus concentration in the sediment but it only had marginal effects on total nitrogen. Although the net fish yields were highly variable between sites and seasons, ranging from 402 to 1069 kg ha(-1), the data showed that manuring was advantageous. The duration of the culture period, site variability and manuring explained 82% of the variation in fish yields. We conclude that Fingerponds fertilized with livestock manure from abutting riparian subsistence agriculture can improve fish production, enhance food diversity and security and contribute to more efficient use of papyrus wetlands for food production. This in turn may reduce large-scale conversion of wetlands to agriculture.					van Dam, Anne/M-4251-2013; KIPKEMBOI, JULIUS/ABF-1956-2021														0923-4861	1572-9834				AUG	2010	18	4					471	483		10.1007/s11273-010-9180-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-010-9180-4													WOS:000280074900006
J	SABIN, TJ; HOLLIDAY, VT				SABIN, TJ; HOLLIDAY, VT			PLAYAS AND LUNETTES ON THE SOUTHERN HIGH-PLAINS - MORPHOMETRIC AND SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												The surface of the Southern High Plains is dotted with thousands of small (<5 km(2)), circular, seasonally dry depressions, or playas, some of which are accompanied by a crescentic dune ridge, or lunette. The playas are inset into the sheets of eolian sediment that blanket the region (Blackwater Draw Formation) and the lunettes rest on the eolian mantle. Approximately 25,000 small playas, 1,100 of which have a lunette, were counted from all 540 topographic quadrangles covering the region (verified using data from soil surveys). Statistical analyses of the physical and spatial relationships of playas and lunettes were undertaken to better understand the origins and development of playas, and their relationship to lunettes. Data were collected from a subset of 40 topographic maps, digitized on a CIS, and analyzed using a nonparametric statistical procedure. Variation in texture of the Blackwater Draw Formation exerts considerable control on the distribution and size of playas. Playas are most numerous in the coarsest (sandy), most easily deflated substrate, followed by the finest substrate which produce erodible, sand-size aggregates. The deepest playas and those with largest area also are in the finest, easily erodible substrate. These data support the hypothesis of playa development by erosion rather than by dissolution and subsidence. Lunettes most often are associated with deeper and wider playas. Presence or absence of lunettes probably is related to the nature of the playa fill and is not a function of substrate texture. Lunettes form from deflation of calcareous playa fill which is more common in larger playas. Otherwise, the controls on the distribution of this fill are unknown.																			0004-5608					JUN	1995	85	2					286	305		10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01795.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01795.x													WOS:A1995RK69100004
J	Gu, BH; Schelske, CL				Gu, BH; Schelske, CL			Temporal and spatial variations in phytoplankton carbon isotopes in a polymictic subtropical lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Stable carbon isotopes (delta(13)C) were determined for phytoplankton and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from Lake Apopka, a shallow, polymictic and hypereutrophic lake in Florida, USA. Bulk plankton dominated by pico- and nanocyanobacteria were enriched in C-13 (-13.1 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand) as a result of assimilation of extremely C-13 rich DIC (delta(13)C = 9.6 +/- 3.0 parts per thousand). Diatoms (Aulacoseira spp.) had a delta(13)C of -14.3 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand that was slightly more negative than that of small cyanobacteria. Meroplanktonic diatoms had a delta(13)C (-13.6 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand), similar to their planktonic counterparts. The delta(13)C of a colonial cyanobacterium (Microcystis incerta) was exceptionally heavy (-3.0 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand) and attributed to localized carbon limitation. Seasonal variation in delta(13)C of bulk plankton was small (<3 parts per thousand ) relative to reports for other lacustrine systems. No difference in the delta(13)C of bulk plankton from surface water between stratified and non-stratified periods was found. No measurable changes in delta(13)C of bulk plankton were indicated in light and dark incubation experiments. Frequent wind mixing of the water column, high DIC concentration, and consistently high lake productivity were used to explain the temporal and spatial isotope consistency of phytoplankton in this lake.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV	1996	18	11					2081	2092		10.1093/plankt/18.11.2081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.11.2081													WOS:A1996VX63700006

Micromonospores assumed a notable dominance (from 39 to 89%) in the actinomycete populations of these lake sediments, Streptomycetes were the second most abundant organisms, The diversity and counts of actinomycetes varied with the season, Thermophilic actinomycetes have a wide distribution in these lakes, but their counts were smaller, The cell wall compositions of certain Micromonospora and Streptomyces strains from an alkaline lake revealed an unusual combination of glycine and isomers of diaminopimelic acid, It seems that aquatic actinomycetes play a significant role in the decomposition of organic substances, including some toxic compounds such as phenol, in these lakes, It also appears that aquatic actinomycetes are one of the important resources for screening useful enzymes and metabolites.																			0099-2240					JAN	1996	62	1					249	253		10.1128/AEM.62.1.249-253.1996	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.62.1.249-253.1996								16535213					WOS:A1996TN22600041

Of these, 23 of 30 (77%) adults and 4 of 46 (9%) tadpoles of P. t. triseriata shed oocysts of Isospora cogginsi n. sp. Oocysts of I. cogginsi were ovoid, 19.3 X 15.1 (18-23 X 11-20) mum, with a thin, smooth, colorless, single-layered wall, with no micropyle or oocyst residuum. Sporocysts were ovoid, 13.3 X 9.9 (11-15 X 9-13) mum, with a thin, colorless, smooth wall, and Stieda body absent. Sporocyst residuum was present, 5.5 X 5.3 (4-7 X 4-7) mum, consisting of numerous granules. Histological examination of frogs and tadpoles infected with the new species revealed endogenous stages including mature meronts, developing microgamonts, mature microgametes, mature macrogamonts, and young unsporulated oocysts located in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Concurrently, 2 adult P. t. triseriata shed oocysts of Eimeria streckeri. Oocysts of E. streckeri were spherical, 15.7 X 15.4 (14-17 X 14-19) mum, with a thin, smooth, si n.-le- layered, colorless wall with an oocyst residuum composed of numerous granules surrounding a large vacuolated area, with a previously undescribed globularlike body present within the vacuole, and no micropyle. Sporocysts were ovoid, 9.1 X 6.1 (7-10 X 5-7) mum, with a thin, colorless, smooth wall with a Stieda body and sporocyst residuum. Our results are the first to document infection of adult and tadpole stages of frogs of the same species with the same species of coccidian, indicating that adult frogs may contaminate breeding ponds with oocysts during their breeding season and infect tadpoles directly by the ingestion of sporulated oocysts.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				JUN	2003	89	3					522	528		10.1645/0022-3395(2003)089[0522:OOTLHA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/0022-3395(2003)089[0522:OOTLHA]2.0.CO;2								12880252					WOS:000183955300016
J	Viroux, L				Viroux, L			Zooplankton distribution in flowing waters and its implications for sampling: case studies in the River Meuse (Belgium) and the River Moselle (France, Luxembourg)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Zooplankton spatial distribution was studied on four occasions by transect sampling on the rivers Moselle and Meuse in July 1996. Sampling sites were selected for their variety in morphology. A pseudoreplicate-based sampling scheme was adopted that allowed small-scale longitudinal variations in density to be tested along with transversal position and depth. In the Moselle, zooplankton were unevenly distributed transversally, an observation tentatively linked with the complexity of the river channel and the influence of tributaries. In the Meuse, spatial heterogeneity was stronger, and depth also played a key role. Its effect was different for rotifers and microcrustaceans. The occurrence of zooplankton patches, similar to those commonly reported from lakes, was noted. The factors leading to the establishment of such distribution patterns, and their relevance to routine sampling, are briefly discussed; a short list of recommendations for sampling in large rivets is proposed.																			0142-7873					JUL	1999	21	7					1231	1248		10.1093/plankt/21.7.1231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.7.1231													WOS:000081789500003

The paper discusses the initial results from two salt lakes, Salina Anzoategui (39-degrees-00'23''S, 63-degrees-46'30''W) and Salina Piedra (40-degrees-34'59''S, 62-degrees-40'26''W), lying in closed depressions at the northeastern margin of the arid diagonal of Patagonia. Both the sedimentological and the palynological results of the analyzed sediment cores from these playa lakes suggest prevailing arid climatic conditions with mainly aeolian morphodynamic processes during the mid-Holocene. In late Holocene times the climate changed to more semi-arid conditions, with a higher rainfall frequency and more frequent fluvial input into the lake, possibly reflecting greater influence from the Atlantic high pressure cell leading to more distinct seasonality.

Gonad development and size-at-maturity of silver therapon Leiopotherapon plumbeus (Kner 1864; Teleostei:Terapontidae) in tropical volcanic lakes in south Luzon, Philippines	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Gonad development of the silver therapon Leiopotherapon plumbeus in two volcanic crater lake habitats (Sampaloc Lake, Taal Lake) in south Luzon, Philippines was examined during the annual reproductive cycle. The minimum body size-at-maturity of fish in these two lake habitats was also compared. Four gonad development stages were characterized as basis for the classification of ovarian (immature, maturing, mature, spawned) and testicular maturation (immature, maturing, mature) phases. The occurrence of all development stages in individual gonads suggest an asynchronous development whereby advanced stages are recruited continuously from a pool of younger stage germ cells to result in elevated female and male GSI throughout the annual cycle due to active gonadogenesis. Together with the increasing occurrence of advanced stage oocytes and spermatozoa from March until October, the elevated GSI of fish may indicate peak gonadal growth during the onset of the dry season (December-January) for eventual spawning from the beginning (May-June) until the end of the wet season (October-November). In both lake habitats, male fish were smaller than females but, regardless of sex, the minimum size-at-maturity of fish in Sampaloc Lake was significantly smaller than fish in Taal Lake. Overall, asynchronous development during oogenesis and spermatogenesis allows for year-round reproduction of silver therapon, with elevated gonad growth in the dry season in preparation for spawning during the wet season. Compared with fish in Taal Lake, a smaller size-at-maturity of fish in Sampaloc Lake may be a response of the wild fishery stock to long-term high fishing mortality and degradation of the lake habitat.

Pesticide residues, if they enter water bodies, will impair water quality and pose risks to human health. During flood season, floodwater could wash off large amount of pesticide residues to rivers and lakes. A pesticide-loss simulation and health-risk assessment (PSHA) system was developed to predict pesticide losses and evaluate associated health risks during flood season. A case study was conducted in the Auglaize-Blanchard Watershed in Ohio to calibrate and verify the proposed system. The results showed a reasonable prediction accuracy and model performance. The PSHA system was then applied to estimate pesticide losses and assess health risks during May 199 7 to April 1998, especially during the flood season from May to August. The results show that water discharge during the flood season contributed 90 percent of the total pesticide losses. The chronic and acute health risks were then quantified and the results showed that the health risks caused by atrazine losses were markedly high during flood season. Therefore, pesticides applied during flood season would cause more serious pollution problems and higher health risks than that in other times. Flood season was shown to be a critical period for not only controlling flooding hazards but also mitigating pesticide pollution.

J	Odokuma, LO; Isirima, JC				Odokuma, Lucky O.; Isirima, Joshua C.			Distribution of cyanotoxins in aquatic environments in the Niger Delta	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												The presence and types of cyanotoxins in some aquatic environments in the Niger Delta were investigated. Water samples surveyed in the study were surface water of Sombreiro, Nun and New Calabar Rivers. Others were groundwater from Abonnema and Kiama and pond water from Ogboro. Sampling locations of Sombreiro and the New Calabar rivers and the groundwater at Abonnema are all in the Rivers State while other locations were in Bayelsa State all in Nigeria. Cyanotoxins were extracted using the rotary evaporator procedure. The toxins were intraperitoneally administered to mice. Pathological studies revealed that the extracts contained hepatotoxic peptides (microcystin and nodularin), cytotoxic alkaloids (cylindrospermopsin) and neurotoxic alkaloids (anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a(s) and saxitoxin). Cyanobacterial examination of the water samples revealed that Anabena was the most predominant cyanobacterium. Anabena and Microcystis were more predominant in the river and pond water while Anabena and Cylindrospermopsis were more predominant in the ground water. The nutrient load of water bodies influenced biomass (weight) of cyanobacteria. High nutrient load (BOD, COD, nitrates, sulphate, etc) produced high cyanobacterial biomass while low nutrient load produced correspondingly low cyanobacterial biomass. Nutrient load of river water were significantly higher than groundwater samples. The pond water produced intermediate values of most physicochemical parameters. The percentage hydrocarbon utilizing fungal counts (6.6 - 10.0%), total coliform (240 MPN/100 ml) and fecal coliform (92 to 160 MPN/100 ml) counts were greater than ground water samples (0%, 7.9 to 24 MPN/100 ml and 0.18 to 0.93 MPN/100 ml) respectively. These results suggested that though the conventional bacterial indicators were high, the presence of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in these aquatic systems may also contribute to rendering these drinking water sources unfit for domestic consumption.																			1684-5315					OCT 18	2007	6	20					2375	2385																WOS:000250469300015
J	Sluis, W; Tandarich, J				Sluis, W; Tandarich, J			Siltation and hydrologic regime determine species composition in herbaceous floodplain communities	PLANT ECOLOGY												Interest in the restoration of riparian habitat is increasing. However, little is known about factors responsible for riparian communities, especially grasslands. In order to construct plant communities for a restoration project in the floodplain of a large river in the Midwestern United States, we sampled four floodplains with various disturbance regimes located in Illinois and Missouri. They were chosen to be representative of different plant communities of floodplains, with a focus on herbaceous communities. The areas included backwater lakes, alluvial fans, groundwater seep marshes, oxbow marshes, seasonally inundated grassland, and non-inundated grassland. Vegetation, soils and groundwater or standing water depth were measured at various intervals along transects. Communities were produced using TWINSPAN and tested for differences in environmental factors. The soil morphology, taxonomic classification, and fertility parameters were similar among sites. Environmental factors influencing community composition were the presence of permanent water and silt deposition. We conclude that water depth determines species composition in permanently wet areas. Silt deposition determines composition in seasonally inundated grassland. Where silt deposition is high enough to inhibit seedling emergence, dominance is attained by plants able to reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes. Such a reproductive process leads to nearly monotypic stands produced by large clones. Results are discussed in relation to models of riparian processes and succession.																			1385-0237					JUL	2004	173	1					115	124		10.1023/B:VEGE.0000026335.44232.1c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:VEGE.0000026335.44232.1c													WOS:000221178700010

Measurements of twelve chemical and physical variables and phytoplankton collections were carried out at eight sampling stations. The Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria groups were in highest fractions during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The limnological abiotic variables showed a homogenous spatial distribution. The cluster analysis, using Bray-Curtis distance, distinguished two major groups, represented by the most common and abundant species in both the periods. The results showed that the climate regime, due to the seasonal changes in pluviosity, was a determinant over the phytoplanktonic community structure at Caco pond.																			1516-8913	1678-4324				DEC	2003	46	4					641	651		10.1590/S1516-89132003000400019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1516-89132003000400019													WOS:000220990900019
J	MacKay, NA; Elser, JJ				MacKay, NA; Elser, JJ			Nutrient recycling by Daphnia reduces N2 fixation by cyanobacteria	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A field experiment in an experimentally eutrophied lake (Lake 227) tested the hypothesis that differential recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus by Daphnia (a zooplankter with low body N:P ratio) affects the physiological status of cyanobacterial including rates of NI fixation (stoichiometric recycling hypothesis). After a 5-d incubation in 2.4-liter bottles, Daphnia treatments had lower standing stocks of algae (based on particulate carbon or Chl a) and higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients than did Epischura (a high N:P ratio consumer) or control treatments lacking macrozooplankton. The N:P ratio of dissolved nutrients was higher in the Daphnia treatments than in control or Epischura treatments, consistent with the stoichiometric recycling hypothesis, and was associated with greater algal P deficiency. Measurements of absolute and C-specific N-2 fixation rates following the incubation showed that Daphnia treatments experienced a 50% reduction in N-2 fixation relative to Epischura and control treatments. This reduction is consistent with the higher N:P ratio of the dissolved pool in the Daphnia treatment, as NH4-N inhibits N-2 fixation. Thus, by differentially recycling NH4-N relative to P, Daphnia reduce the advantage (N-2 fixation) cyanobacteria have over other phytoplankton. We suggest that this mechanism may be an important factor in the ability of Daphnia to reduce the incidence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes with low N:P loading ratios.

C	MacIntyre, S		Imberger, J		MacIntyre, S			Turbulent mixing and resource supply to phytoplankton	PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN LAKES IN OCEANS	COASTAL AND ESTUARINE STUDIES				Symposium on Physical Limnology	SEP, 1995	BROOME, AUSTRALIA	Int Union Theoret & Appl Mechan				The temporal and spatial variability of turbulence was determined by profiles of temperature-gradient microstructure or from surface energy budgets in three shallow and two deep lake basins. Rates of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy epsilon, length scales of turbulent eddies, the coefficient of eddy diffusivity, and irradiance measurements were used to infer the light climate of phytoplankton. Time scales of mixing tau(mix), are contrasted with time scales for photoadaptation tau(a),. On calm days in a stratified basin, phytoplankton circulated within eddies that were at most 10% of the depth of the euphotic zone and could have experienced fluctuations that were up to 20% of surface irradiance. tau(mix) was rapid enough that phytoplankton in the surface layer would not have had time to develop differences in photoadaption if tau(a) greater than or equal to 15 minutes. On windy days, overturns extended throughout and even beyond the depth of the euphotic zone. When overturns at the surface were larger than 1 meter, differences in the extent of photoadaptation would develop within overturns if tau(a) = 15 minutes. For tau(a) = 6 hours, photoadaptation was unlikely within weakly stratified surface overturns. The turbulence data also were used to assess physical mechanisms important for fluxes of biologically important materials. Convective motions due to heat loss at night were more important than wind mixing in the day for vertical transport of solutes in a shallow, equatorial lake. Either intrusions or the inefficiency of mixing where turbulent Froude numbers are less than one led to persistent stratification during the day of heat, particles and solutes in a eutrophic lake despite moderate wind forcing. Wind forcing in a seasonally stratified lake led to upwelling and mixing in the thermocline. Because concentrations of PO4-P increased below the depth of mixing, algae remained phosphorus limited. The muted biological response to high winds was in contrast to the five-fold increase in algal biomass in a shallow, attached basin in which phosphorus limitation was briefly alleviated due to sediment resuspension. Boundary mixing in a meromictic lake led to values of epsilon and nutrient fluxes that were two to four orders of magnitude higher at an onshore site than they were at an offshore site at similar depths.																			0938-0949		0-87590-268-5				1998	54						561	590																WOS:000079137400038

Ill the polar regions, climate models indicate an amplification of global greenhouse warming, but there are large differences between the results of various models, and uncertainties about the magnitude and timing of the expected changes. Also, the observed high-latitude climate trends over the past few decades are much more regional and patchy than predicted by the models. As a first step in assessing possible climate impacts, model results are compared with observations of changes in temperature, precipitation, sea-ice extent, the permafrost regime and other cryospheric parameters. While considerable uncertainties remain in the long-term prediction of change, there is some agreement between model results and observed trends by season on shorter time-scales. The warming observed over the land masses of the Arctic over the past few decades is matched by corresponding observed decreases in snow cover and glacier mass balances, by thawing of the permafrost: and to a lesser degree by reductions in sea-ice extent. In Antarctica, warming in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions is associated with large decreases in ice-shelf areas and reduced ice thicknesses on the lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Major future impacts due to global greenhouse warming are likely to include permafrost thawing on land and its consequences for ecosystems and humans: changes in the productivity of marine ecosystems in the Arctic and Southern Ocean; economic impacts on fisheries; petroleum and other human activities; and social impacts on northern indigenous populations. Some of these impacts will have positive ramifications, but most are likely to be detrimental. While uncertainties exist about the future, climate change in the polar regions during the past few decades can he shown to have had major impacts already which will become much more pronounced if present trends continue.																			0260-3055		0-946417-22-9				1998	27						543	552																WOS:000079713100090
J	Stockwell, JD; Johnson, BM				Stockwell, JD; Johnson, BM			Refinement and calibration of a bioenergetics-based foraging model for kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Results from a mechanistic, bioenergetics-based foraging model for kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) were compared with results from a corroborated standard model. Daily growth estimates from the mechanistic model were 239% higher than estimates from the standard model at temperatures greater than or equal to 12 degrees C, and 42% lower at temperatures less than or equal to 8 degrees C. The mechanistic model was then modified by incorporating a different respiration function and a new size-and temperature-dependent functional response. Although sensitive to prey and predator size, prey handling time, and feeding duration, results from the modified model were comparable with those from the standard model. Using observed vertical profiles of temperature and prey densities, model growth estimates for kokanee from Blue Mesa Reservoir, Colorado, bounded observed growth under realistic ranges of model parameters. The model also made the following four predictions: seasonal and annual ontogenetic shifts in (i) foraging and (ii) migration strategies; (iii) very low prey handling times (0.33 s.Daphnia(-1)) for larger fish, suggesting that kokanee may be capable of gulp or filter feeding; and (iv) higher daily maximum consumption rates for smaller kokanee than previously hypothesized.

It was determined that there were similarities with respect to length distributions (9.6 - 34.5; 9.5 - 35.3), b value from length - weight relationships (2.45 - 2.67), condition factors (1.18 +/- 0.01 - 1.17 +/- 0.01), Von Bertalanffy constants L(infinity), K, t(o) (52.15 - 0.137 - (-)1.351; 41.11 - 0.20 - (-)0.54) of lake and stream populations respectively, the differencs were also not significant in all compared properties. The most affected bio-ecological trait was reproduction times. Total fat values were higher in females than in males, but seasonally it was vice versa (38%, - 27%). Significant seasonal differences were determined with respect to total SFA (saturated fatty acids), MUFA (monoenoic unsaturated fatty acids, n-3, n-6 PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) (p < 0.05).					; BAYIR, Ayşegül/KHY-9204-2024	Bayir, Aysegul/0000-0002-5680-031X; 													1300-1361						2009	19	73					55	64		10.5053/ekoloji.2009.737	http://dx.doi.org/10.5053/ekoloji.2009.737													WOS:000272330300007

In general, chlorophyll concentrations in the central part of the lake were high throughout the growth season. The minimum chlorophyll concentration was recorded in March (7.5 mg m(-3)), and the maximum value in September (303 mg m(-3)). Higher chlorophyll concentrations and lower temporal variability were measured in the central part of the lake, compared to lower concentrations and higher variability in the vicinity of the Lupawa River input to the lake. Chlorophyll concentrations were measured fluorometrically along several vertical and horizontal profiles, enabling direct observations of the dynamics of changing chlorophyll concentrations in Lake Gardno throughout the year.

Evaluation of biodegradation potential of organic compounds by river water microorganisms	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The aim of this study was to assess the availability of the biodegradation potential of aniline and phenol as the indicator for evaluating pollutant impact on a river environment. Biodegradation tests employing river water microorganisms were carried out by a modified TOC-Handai method using aniline and phenol as substrates. Complete degradation time and half-life were determined as indicators expressing the biodegradation potential of aniline and phenol, respectively. Investigations in Lake Biwa-Yodo River basin for more than two years showed that the biodegradation potential of both compounds varied seasonally. In addition, aniline biodegradation potential seemed to be influenced by the hydraulic retention time at each sampling station, while downstream stations with large input of wastewater from the surrounding cities were divided from upstream stations by phenol biodegradation potential. Comparison of the biodegradation potential in rivers at different pollution levels also showed that polluted and less polluted rivers were clearly divided by phenol biodegradation potential. These results indicated that phenol biodegradation potential can be applied as an indicator for evaluating the soundness of river environment from the view point of ecological function.

The study was conducted in five walnut orchards in the Adilcevaz county in Bitlis (three orchards) and Gevas county in Van (two orchards), during the growing seasons of 2005-2006. Surveys were carried out in every week from May to November. The results of study indicated that the population densities of mites began to increase generally in early July, reached the maximum level at late July and at early August and preserved to late October. In this period, the population densities of Aceria erinea Nalepa (Acari: Eriophyidae) and Eotetranychus carpini (Oudemans) (Acari: Tetranychidae) were determined as 51.9 galls/leaf and 304.1 mites/leaf, respectively. Euseius finlandicus (Oudemans) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) was the most effective predatory mite on E. carpini and A. erinea and it was observed that its population reached to 4.5 mites/leaf. In the sprayed orchard, E. finlandicus population was not enough for controlling mites and the population densities remained at very low levels.

The non regulated use of such chemicals may lead to damage in aquatic ecosystems that receive the ponds effluents, compromising environmental and consumers' health. With the aim of evaluate the use of pesticides in aquacultural practices developed in Mogi-Guacu catchment, fish farm and fee fishing owners were interviewed. Eighty-nine enterprises were visited, and was verified that about 40% uses pesticide during management practices in recent years. The diflubenzuron, methyl parathion, trichlorfon and triflumuron were the pesticides most used. In addition to the interviews, samples were taken in 3 enterprises localized in Socorro, SP (Peixe River sub-catchment) which had a pesticide usage history. It was not detected residues of the pesticides diflubenzuron, methyl parathion and dichlorvos in any water, sediments nor fishes samples from tow distinct seasons (lower and high fishing seasons). On fact, non-detected pesticides residues corroborate with the fish farmers statement to deny recently pesticide usage during management practices. Nevertheless, the lack of chemotherapeutics usage criteria and the potential hazardous due to these practices were discussed.

The lake has an area of 656 km2 with an average depth of 5 m. Metal concentrations of aluminium (Al), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined in Lake Beysehir on 9 June and 19 August 2005, and 12 June and 22 August 2006. The water samples were collected from 40 sampling stations. The aim of this research is to determine metal concentrations and their seasonal and spatial variability in the lake. Generally, metal concentrations of Lake Beysehir were found to decrease in the sequence of Fe Al Zn Cr Ni Pb Cu Cd as 92.8, 81.8, 7.4, 2.7, 2.2, 1.9, 1.7 and 0.5 g L-1, respectively. The results showed that the mean concentrations of the metals in the lake water did not exceed WHO (World Health Organization), US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) or TWQCR (Turkish Water Pollution and Control Regulations) drinking water guidelines. On the other hand, maximum levels of metals sporadically exceeded these standards in some sampling stations, especially for Al, Cr, Fe, and Pb.

N.; Galkate, Ravi			A comprehensive study on water balance, sedimentation and physico-chemical characteristics of Sagar Lake in India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In this study, an attempt has been made to work out water balance, determine rate of sedimentation and physico-chemical analysis of the lake water. The water balance is carried out using the mass balance equation to account for various input and output components. Sedimentation rates and pattern are estimated using (137)Cs and (210)Pb radiometric dating techniques. The physico-chemical analysis of the lake water is done by collecting samples from twelve locations of the lake at three different depths. The major inflow to the lake is catchment runoff, which accounts for nearly 56% of the total annual inflow and about 98% inflow takes place during monsoon period. The major outflow from the lake is weir overflow, which occurs in monsoon season only and accounts for about 85% of the total annual outflow. The estimated mean sedimentation rate in the lake is 0.58 +/- 0.028 cm/year. The estimated useful life of the lake based on post-1964 (appearance of the major peak of (137)Cs due to weapon fallout record pattern) average sedimentation rate is around 467 +/- 23 years. The lake has attained the hyper-eutrophic state due to high nitrogen and phosphorous contents in the lake water. Based on the trophic state index (TSI), the lake has become unsuitable for drinking, bathing and even for fish culture.																			0167-6369					JAN	2009	148	1-4					265	276		10.1007/s10661-008-0157-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0157-1								18256900					WOS:000261581800024

Besides picoeukaryotes, two groups of picocyanobacteria have also been detected by flow cytometry. One is a phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-rich Pcy), the other is a red-fluorescing cells with lacking orange fluorescence and could be a phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-rich Pcy). The average abundances of PC-rich Pcy, PE-rich Pcy and picoeukaryotes were 10(3), 10(4) and 10(2) cells mL(-1), respectively. PE-rich Pcy was the dominant population but showed a reduction with eutrophication, and therefore the community structure of picophytoplankton transformed from dominant PE-rich Pcy to dominant PE-rich Pcy and PC-rich Pcy, which suggested they are excellent indicators for the change of trophic state. Picophytoplankton community structure also presented a seasonal variation, indicating the different response of each picophytoplankton group to water temperature.					; Wu, Yanyou/IYT-1350-2023; Liu, Cong-qiang/G-6714-2012	Wu, Yanyou/0000-0002-0940-4349; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2009	68	1					53	63		10.4081/jlimnol.2009.53	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2009.53													WOS:000266257300006

The results obtained demonstrate the existence of a dense seed-bank, both in terms of the number of seeds and their biomass, which represented about 10 % (5 % for angiosperms and > 20 % for Charophyta) of the total plant biomass, which ensures the maintenance of the annual submerged macrophyte populations of the seasonally inundated Donana marsh. Seed bank and established vegetation were coupled, as reflected in the existence of significant correlations between their structure and abundance. This coupling was lacking for Charophyta, whose oospores are widespread and abundant across the marsh, even at locations where they are absent, or rare, in the established vegetation. These differences between the seed bank of annual angiosperms and Charophyta appear to reflect, in part, structural differences between angiosperm seeds and Charophyta oospores, with important ecological consequences. An important aspect of these differences is the allocation of Charophyta reproductive effort to many small propagules lacking embryo storage, compared to those of angiosperms, which ensures their efficient dispersal and numerical abundance in the seed bank.

We observe in both continents a well-developed dense forest at 30,000 and 9000 yr B.P. The succession of vegetation types during the Late Quaternary appeared strongly related to the regional conditions: (1) the dense forest was more or less degraded depending on the regions during the last full glacial period (20,000-15,000 yr B.P.); (2) a slow increase of tree elements is evidenced in some areas during the Late Glacial (15,000-10,000 yr B.P.), whereas short-term fluctuations occurred in central Brazil during the same time; (3) a strong regression of the forest during the middle Holocene (6000-5000 yr B.P.), in the southern tropical zone of South America, was in opposition to a full forest development in Africa. In both continents two main features characterize the tropical forest evolution: (1) Montane elements developed in the lowlands during the last glacial period and in some southern or northern regions during the early Holocene; and (2) the climate seasonality was enhanced in several regions since 8500-7500 yr B.P. For a tentative explanation, we relate the cold or cool climate, inferred by palaeoecological evidences in the glacial period and glacial-interglacial transition, to polar air-masses reaching more frequently the tropical zone. This interpretation explains the apparent contradiction between the markedly low temperature of the continental lowlands opposed: (1) at 18,000 yr B.P., to the 1-2-degrees-C lower Sea Surface Temperature of tropical oceans and (2) to the global warming during the late glacial. During the middle and Late Holocene, climate evolution was mainly influenced by the latitudinal shift of the ITCZ positions in July and January and, in South America, by short-term changes of the zonal atmospheric circulation.

This method is based on solid-phase extraction on a zirconium-loaded Sep-Pack Accell CM cartridge (Zr-SP) and is applicable to studies in which sampling is performed by use of a graduated syringe to prevent contamination and to ensure easy operation at sampling sites. The Zr-SP cartridge was prepared by passing 0.1 mol L-1 zirconium solution through a Sep-Pak Accell CM cartridge, packed with cation exchange sorbent based on a silica matrix. The adsorption of phosphate and its desorption depend only on the pH of the solution. A water sample containing phosphate was adjusted to pH 2 and passed through the Zr-SP cartridge to collect it. The retained phosphate was quantitatively eluted with 0.5 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide solution. The phosphate retained in the Zr-SP cartridge was stable for at least one month. The established preconcentration method was successfully applied to brackish lake waters to investigate seasonal changes in the distribution and behavior of phosphate in a brackish lake.																			0937-0633					MAY	2001	370	1					104	107		10.1007/s002160100739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002160100739								11393228					WOS:000169027600020

Ecological specificity and spatial and temporal distribution of ciliates from the pelagic plankton of a fresh meromictic waterbody	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The data on changes in the vertical distribution of free-living ciliates from a freshwater meromictic pond (city of Samara) within a year are presented. The specific character of the waterbody is that the taxonomic diversity of ciliates of pelagic plankton is mainly formed not by usual euplanktonic species, but by ciliates of highly specialized ecological groups such as mixotrophs, "benthic migrants," and sapropelic species. The ciliate fauna is similar to the fauna of thermally stratified lakes with anaerobic hypolimnion. The maximal abundance and biomass of ciliates during the year and their high absolute values are determined by the existence of stable gradients of abiotic factors and, in the first turn, concentrations of oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and oxidation-reduction potential.

This study analyzed the physiological responses of lake-resident anadromous masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) and sockeye salmon (O. nerka) to migration in order to determine if these fish might serve as a suitable model for ocean-running populations and to differentiate between physiological responses to reproduction and to exercise-linked aspects of migration. Reproductive (estradiol, testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone, 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one) and metabolically-linked (thyroxine, triiodothyronine) hormones showed similar patterns to ocean-running anadromous populations. White muscle pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase decreased with the onset of spawning season while white muscle citrate synthase, beta-hydroxyacetyl CoA dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase did not, suggesting that the former group of enzymes are responding to reproductive or food intake signals while the second group, which typically change during anadromous migration, may be responding to exercise-linked aspects of migration.

During the day, the most risky habitats were just above the thermocline near the substrate and in open water at the same depth. Risk was intermediate at the surface in the littoral zone and at the surface over the intersection of the thermocline and the lake bottom. The least risky habitat was at the surface in the open water. The intensity and spatial pattern of relative predation risk changed at dusk. The most risky habitat was still at the thermocline-lake bottom intersection, but it was more than twice as risky as during the day, At dusk, relative predation risk increased in the littoral zone and at the surface above the thermocline-lake bottom intersection. The open-water habitats, both at the surface and at the thermocline, had a low relative predation risk. Age-0 and older rainbow trout in the experimental populations segregated in their use of habitat. with the majority of age-0 trout in the littoral zone and the majority of older conspecifics in the pelagic zone. Survival rate of age-0 rainbow trout over the growing season was inversely correlated with instantaneous measures of relative predation risk but approached an asymptote at high relative predation risk, suggesting that the littoral zone provides a refuge that prevents the elimination of age-0 fish by piscivory.																			0002-8487					NOV	1998	127	6					932	942		10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127<0932:SATVIR>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127<0932:SATVIR>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000078728600006

After adjustment for detection bias, there was a minor upstream direction to movements. Seasonal changes of location were not evident from field trips taken only twice yearly. Annual movements averaged less than 1 km except for those of pubescent males, which appeared to be nomadic. Creche dispersal was randomly directed but associated with a threshold in mass/length ratio. On average, males were found further from previous capture sites than were females. Adults of both sexes moved shorter distances than did immature crocodiles with a clear reduction in movements occurring as mass/length ratios approached 0.17 kg per cm snout-vent length. Reduced movement at that general size ratio probably indicated the onset of territoriality associated with maturity. Females usually remained near breeding sites even in years when they did not breed. Nomadic tendencies of pubescent males are probably associated with unsuccessful attempts at entering local dominance hierarchies. Linear home ranges were estimated to be 1.5-1.9 km for immature animals, 1.2 km for pubescent females, 30.3 km for pubescent males, 0.6 km for mature females and 1.6 km for adult males.

Data from Topex/Poseidon (TP) and Jason-1 (J1) missions at GSL for the ice-free seasons of 1993-2002 and 2002-2008, respectively, reveal lower performance of J1 for areas closer to 20 km from the coastline compared to 10 km for TP. A calculated bias of 6.99 cm was subtracted to J1 range since TP has better tracking of shoreline waters and lower data rejection. High correlation coefficients for the relative rate of change between lake altimetry heights (LAHs) and corresponding gauge data for Yellowknife Bay and Hay River support the use of LAH changes as effective indicators of variability at GSL. Differences in LAH between the five areas indicate a nonuniform slope which we relate more to variability of the surface water temperature distribution than wind effects. The deeper and colder areas are associated to the least change of LAH gradient through time; therefore, they represent ideal areas to study interannual climate variability. A potential correlation between areas with higher variability in LAH gradients and higher changes in modeled surface water temperatures during the 2003 ice free season is observed.

J	Zilioli, E; Brivio, PA				Zilioli, E; Brivio, PA			The satellite derived optical information for the comparative assessment of lacustrine water quality	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The objective of this research is to define the support that can be derived from satellite optical remote sensing to monitor the trophic status of lake waters, even in the absence of corroborating in situ measurements. An analysis was conducted on Lake Garda (Italy), where sub-basins showing different water quality conditions can be delineated. For this purpose, two Landsat-TM images, taken in April and August 1985, at specific seasonal situations of the limnological cycle were used. Image processing provided radiance-derived quantities, such as reflectance and chromaticity, in the form of digital transects drawn from the margin of the lake to cross the pelagic environment. In order to make the multi-temporal analysis possible, a method for compensating the differential haze effect between the two images, based on the darkest object technique was adopted. Results demonstrated the suitability of satellite remote sensing observations as a fast and relatively low cost effective tool for early and expeditious assessment of both the spatial and temporal variability of lake water quality conditions.

Microcystins were detected in all samples of Microcystis with quantities varying seasonally and spatially (230-950 mug.g dry wt-1 at St. 1 and 160-746 mug.g dry wt-1 at St. 2) and composed of microcystin-LR, -RR, and -YR. Microcystin-RR was the dominant toxin in most samples. A large amount of microcystin (1.1 mug.L-1) was detected in only one sample of filtered lake water. Accumulation of microcystin in zooplankton was indirectly estimated from a newly developed equation model. Large amounts of microcystin (75-1387 mug.g dry wt-1) were accumulated in the zooplankton community, which consisted of two cladocerans, Bosmina fatalis Burckhardt and Diaphanosoma brachyurum Lieve, and a copepod, Cyclops vicinus Uljanin, that co-occurred with the toxic Microcystis blooms. The maximum percent of microcystin content in zooplankton to that in Microcystis was 202%. Among the three species of zooplankton, only B. fatalis seemed to be responsible for accumulation of the microcystins because C. vicinus appeared to avoid contact with Microcystis cells and D. brachyurum did not consume colonies of Microcystis. Microcystins may be transferred to higher trophic levels through B. fatalis.																			0022-3646					DEC	1992	28	6					761	767		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1992.00761.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1992.00761.x													WOS:A1992KH06800006
J	Thébault, JM; Rabouille, S				Thébault, JM; Rabouille, S			Comparison between two mathematical formulations of the phytoplankton specific growth rate as a function of light and temperature, in two simulation models (ASTER & YOYO)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Two simulation methods, that enable calculation of the specific growth rate of phytoplankton as a function of light and temperature, are compared. The first one simulates phytoplankton at a seasonal scale. The module describes the combined effects of these two factors; in this case, the parameters of the g(I) function are expressed in terms of temperature. The second method simulates the vertical migration of cyanobacteria at a daily scale. This-implies to detail the photosynthesis process: carbon fixation as a function of light and synthesis of cell material depending on temperature. These models illustrate two ways of representation of a same mechanism, where the two time and description scales of the-processes aim at different objectives. In terms of specific growth rate, results obtained by both models are highly comparable: (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Demska-Zakes, K; Zakes, Z				Demska-Zakes, K; Zakes, Z			Controlled spawning of pikeperch, Stizostedion lucioperca (L.), in lake cages	CZECH JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of the cage method in pikeperch propagation with and without hormonal stimulation. The study was carried out in 1999-2000 in the Pojezierze Mazurskie, north-eastern Poland. A total of 276 fishes were studied that were caught at natural spawning grounds using a trap gear. The effects of propagation without hormonal stimulation, expressed as the number of ovulating females, were highly significantly dependent (P < 0.05) on the stage of oocyte maturity; they ranged from 0% (stage 1) to 100% (maturity stage IV), with an average value of about 29%. The application of 400 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) per kg of female body weight synchronized the maturation process, facilitated reproduction in less mature fish (especially those in stage 1), and resulted in enhanced spawning effectiveness in which the percentage of resting females was 88%. Hormonal stimulation significantly (P < 0.05) shortened the length of the time the fish were held in spawning cages, which allowed their multiple use during the spawning season. The amount of obtained eggs ranged from 60.0 x 10(3) to 682.5 x 10(3) and it was positively correlated with female body weight (R-2 = 0.6212). A similar, high correlation (R-2 = 0.633) was confirmed between body weight and the number of eggs in the eyed stage. The survival rate until the eyed stage was 84% on average.

The diets were studied through one river flood cycle, from September 1997 to October 1998, when no large flooding occured. For interespecific comparisons, previous data from Leporinus aff. friderici and Schizodon nasutus species has been included. Differences in relation to food activity were observed among the species, in the wet and dry seasons, and according to the environments. From stomach content analises, C. modestus, C. nagelii and P. scrofa were considered as iliophagous species, L. lacustris as omnivorous with herbivorous tendency, while L. aff. friderici was predominantly omnivorous; S. nasutus was considered as an herbivorous species and H. malabaricus piscivorous.

J	Trewin, NH; Davidson, RG				Trewin, NH; Davidson, RG			An Early Devonian Lake and its associated biota in the Midland Valley of Scotland	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH-EARTH SCIENCES												The Tillywhandland fish bed of the Lower Old Red Sandstone in the Strathmore area of the Scottish Midland Valley accumulated in a lake, here called Lake Forfar, which was created suddenly following a period of fluvial deposition. Lake creation may have been due to basin faulting or the disruption of drainage patterns by contemporaneous volcanic activity. The fish bed laminites accumulated in a hydrologically open lake under a seasonal climatic regime. When fully developed, laminites comprise repeated quadruplets of elastic silt/carbonate/organic/green clay-shale laminae averaging 0.5 mm in thickness. Following 2000 years of laminite deposition an increasingly silty succession with thin current-rippled sandstones provided the lake-fill. The fish fauna is dominated by Mesacanthus and Ischnacanthus with rare Euthacanthus, Palexus, Climatius, Vernicomacanthus and Cephalaspis. Most fish carcasses were partially decayed before deposition in the laminites on the poorly oxygenated lake floor. Abundant coprolites are the result of predation on Mesacanthus and small Ischnacanthus, probably by larger Ischnacantus. Arthropods present include eurypterids (Pterygotus), washed in as near complete exuviae and fragments, and millipeds which were washed in from surrounding terrestrial environments along with plants, of which Parka and Zosterophyllum are common. Bioturbation indicates that conditions were not permanently anoxic during deposition of the laminites. Comparison of our collections with the Mitchell Collection accumulated in the 19th century indicates that Tillywhandland Quarry was the main source of specimens in laminite lithologies labelled 'Turin Hill'.																			0263-5933						1996	86		4				233	246		10.1017/S0263593300007641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0263593300007641													WOS:A1996VG85000001

The concentrations of the three toxins in the reservoir varied greatly depending on location and time water samples were collected. Water quality parameters such as light intensity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, suspended solid, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were also measured in parallel with microcystin determinations. Relationships among water quality parameters, toxins and chlorophyll-a were established. Toxin concentration increased in proportion to increases in total phosphorus, fraction of dissolved phosphorus, but was inversely correlated with water pH and total suspended solids. The other measured parameters in the study showed no correlations to toxin level in reservoir water. Significant correlations between chlorophyll-a and suspended solids, phosphate, nitrate and ammonia were observed suggesting that nitrogen and phosphorus are the two major nutrients governing growth of algae in the reservoir. This relationship suggests that algal production as well as toxin concentration are dependant on nutrient levels in the water body, since both measured light intensity and temperature level was favorable for algal growth. A small algal bloom observed in the rainy season of each year (lasting for only a couple of months) paralleled measured increases in toxin concentration, chlorophyll-a, TP and TN in the water column. Toxin level in the water column remain detectable for 3-4 months period following the initiation of algal bloom. Results indicate that major blooms are likely to occur following the raining season which usually occurs near the end of October when runoff would increase nutrient level entering the reservoir. This study also demonstrated that an ongoing field-monitoring program is needed in these lakes and reservoirs for predicting toxic level of microcystin production for use in risk assessment and for alerting the public to potential health hazards. Concentration of toxin in the reservoir can perhaps be controlled by reducing non point source nutrient input within the watershed.

The study aims to identify the origin of problems such as woodland decline and salinization within present ecosystems. Location Warrananga and Tooperoopna salt lakes, south-western New South Wales, Australia. Methods Pollen, carbonized particle and sedimentological analyses of cores taken from salt lakes. Results Prior to c. 4500 years ago, the region supported a dense cover of Casuarinaceae woodlands. It is possible that the subhumid zone species Allocasuarina luehmannii comprised some of the Casuarinaceae element. In the late Holocene, A. luehmannii disappeared from the record and chenopodiaceous low shrublands expanded. About 2000 years ago, Callitris representation decreased. Woodland contraction also occurred after European settlement. Main conclusions Increasing aridity or greater seasonal variation in the climate during the late Holocene caused a contraction of woodland vegetation. Increased proportions of Chenopodiaceae may indicate soil salinization around the basins. A decrease in Callitris was possibly due to heightened severity or frequency of drought events after 2000 years ago. Decline in woodland pollen in the uppermost samples is explained by the preferential clearing of Callitris glaucophylla, Callitris gracilis and Casuarina pauper for timber and their limited regeneration because of browsing by stock and rabbits.

Thus, we (i) conducted comprehensive and comparative measurements of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and other plasma lipids in fed and food-deprived (10 weeks) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and (ii) compared three common methods for measuring total plasma NEFAs (Folch extraction/Iatroscan, Wako((R)) enzymatic, and acetyl chloride extraction/GC). Plasma total lipid, phospholipid, triacylglycerol, and NEFA levels were 83%-95% lower in food-deprived fish. In contrast, the concentration of a previously unidentified lipid class (ethyl ketone) was only 60% lower and was in fact almost threefold higher when expressed as a percentage of total lipid. Considerable differences in the NEFA profile were also observed, for example, 22:1 omega 11 (dominant NEFA in fed fish) was not detected, 20:1 omega 9 was 97% lower, and monounsaturated fatty acids were selectively reduced. Importantly, the acetyl chloride/GC method resulted in an eightfold overestimation of NEFA in fed fish. These results (i) suggest that plasma lipids reflect the energetic/nutritional status of wild gadids and can be used to monitor their responses to changing environmental conditions and (ii) caution against using the acetyl chloride/GC method of NEFA measurement without prior separation of plasma lipids by solid-phase chromatography.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2005	62	11					2509	2518		10.1139/F05-151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F05-151													WOS:000233798300010

The response of natural populations of the dominant dinoflagellate, Peridinium gatunense, to these changes was recorded by examining fluctuations over time in the activity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) and in photosynthetic parameters. Our results show distinct fluctuations of both external and cytoplasmic CA activity in P. gatunense throughout the annual bloom. Higher levels of activity were triggered by the decline of total. dissolved inorganic C below 1.8 mM and more specifically by low concentrations of dissolved CO2 (1-10 mu M) during the seasonal bloom decline in May-June. Laboratory studies on cultured P. gatunense confirmed our field observations, suggesting that supplemental mechanisms are activated in P. gatunense that enhance inorganic C uptake when CO2 is limiting for photosynthesis. Eventually, the cellular adaptations of P. gatunense to the declining CO2 concentrations could not prevent decline of photosynthetic rates contributing to the subsequent decrease in P. gatunense biomass in May-June. In Lake Kinneret, P. gatunense is succeeded by Peridiniopsis spp., the photosynthetic rates and external CA activities of which were much higher under environmental conditions typical of the end of the bloom.

However, the relationship between its habitation conditions and environmental factors remains unclear. We therefore made a habitat prediction model using GLM to define the environment of the C. japonica habitat of Lake Shinji, incorporating data acquired from 1982 through 1983 which measured population density, location, silt/clay content, ignition of physical environmental data, pH, dissolved O2 density, chloride ion concentration, and COD of the quality of the water. Our analysis showed that the standardization parameter ignition loss, measuring organic matter and carbonate content in the sediment, was the main effect in the predictive model (estimate -2.22) and had the greatest absolute value. Thus the C. japonica's distribution is dependent on ignition loss, in the predictive model. As for interaction terms modifying distribution, the dissolved O2 and silt/clay content ratio had the largest absolute value at -2.12. In addition, it was revealed that the environmental factors which limit population levels of the C. japonica every season are different. These results, while derived from C. japonica, also suggest that our GLM model is effective to more fully understand the habitation area of immobile benthoses in general.																			2186-2982	2186-2990				JUL	2019	17	59					68	73		10.21660/2019.59.8125	http://dx.doi.org/10.21660/2019.59.8125													WOS:000457788600011

We investigated how spatial distribution and filtering efficiency of Daphnia in the transition and lacustrine zones of the Nanwan Reservoir (China). Samplings were conducted seasonally for 2 years from six sites in the reservoir. Daphnia abundance and biomass were significantly higher in the lacustrine zone than in the transition zone. Similar composition and biomass of edible phytoplankton were found in the two zones, suggesting that food quantity could not explain high Daphnia distribution in the lacustrine zone. The variations of water velocity and food quality could help explaining Daphnia patchy distribution in the reservoir. On the one hand, rapid water velocity can cause the Daphnia decrement in the transition zone. On the other hand, the ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration was significantly higher in the transition zone, indicating more allochthonous material constituted the food source for Daphnia. The lower quality food likely suppressed Daphnia development in the transition zone. A linear regression between Daphnia abundance and Secchi depth (SD) may suggest a cause-effect relationship where increased filtering efficiency was responsible for increased water clarity to some extent.

CHIRONOMIDS (DIPTERA, CHIRONOMIDAE) OF THE BOTTOM COMMUNITIES IN SALINE RIVERS OF THE LAKE ELTON BASIN: DIVERSITY, SALINITY TOLERANCE, DISTRIBUTION	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The results of long-term studies on chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) in macrozoobenthos communities in five saline rivers of the hyperhaline Lake Elton basin, Volgograd Region are presented. The arid zone of the south of Russia is unique due to specific environmental conditions. Saline rivers are distinguished by size and the spatial dynamics of hydrological, hydrochemal and hydrophysical characteristics; they have a high mineralization gradient ranging from 6 to 41.4 g L-1. In the estuaries of the rivers, the degree mineralization can exceed 100 g L-1. As many as 25 species of chironomids and other taxa collected from brackish and saline rivers (Khara, Lantsug, Bolshaya Samoroda, Chernavka, Solyanka) in 2006-2014 were identified. Ten species mainly inhabit the Solyanka and Chernavka rivers with a salinity level above 20 g L-1. The species Chironomus aprilinus Meigen 1838, C. salinarius Kieffer 1915 and Cricotopus salinophilus Zinchenko, Makarchenko et Makarchenko 2009 prevailed in abundance in the Chernavka and Solyanka rivers, while the chironomids Tanytarsus kharaensis Zorina et Zinchenko 2009 dominated in the Khara and Bolshaya Samoroda rivers. The chironomids of the bottom communities in the saline rivers were represented by eurybiont halo-tolerant species. Their structural, temporal and spatial variations was associated with habitat factors. The taxonomic structure of the chironomid communities in eutrophic saline rivers was shaped by the spatial heterogeneity of habitats and abiotic factors such as the content of individual anions and cations (SO42-, Cl- Na+ + K+), nutrients in the form of mineral phosphorus (PO43--P) etc. The species distribution and abundance were regulated by hydrological and hydrophysical factors (algae blooms, water temperature, pH, granulometric composition of the ground etc.). The diversity of chironomids correlated closely with mineralization levels, whereas the abundance and biomass of chironomids in relation to the mineralization range of 6-41.4 g L-1 was not significant. The seasonal dynamics of the abundance and biomass of chironomids was characterized by the spatial heterogeneity of peaks in a mesohaline river associated with the emergence of imaginal stages of abundant species. This was related to the specific life cycles of amphibiotic insects that shape the structure of benthic communities in saline rivers.																			0044-5134					JUL	2019	98	7					804	818		10.1134/S0044513419070134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0044513419070134													WOS:000479017200009

A total of 391 S, m. melanotheron and 222 T. zillii were examined. Both of the fish species studied were infected by 3 host-specific myxosporean parasites for which prevalence greatly varied during our investigations. The 2 most common ones were Myxobolus sp. and M. zillii, which were located in the branchial filament. No significant fish sex effect was found for these 6 different myxosporean parasites. As seasonal pattern was clearly demonstrated for M. zillii while a host size effect was found for M. dossoui. However, further investigations of these myxosporean infections are necessary to determine the real effect of these parasites on their host, as host fecundity and survival was not assessed.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				APR 10	2001	44	3					217	222		10.3354/dao044217	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao044217								11383569					WOS:000168802800007
J	Depetris, PJ; Pasquini, AI				Depetris, PJ; Pasquini, AI			The hydrological signal of the Perito Moreno Glacier damming of Lake Argentino (southern Andean Patagonia): the connection to climate anomalies	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The periodic damning of Lake Argentino by the Perito Moreno Glacier (50 degrees 30'S, 73 degrees 00'W) in Argentina's southern Patagonian Andes has been recorded seventeen times since the beginning of this century. Such events are significant factors controlling discharge anomalies (seasonal component removed) of the Santa Cruz River, the sole outlet of Lake Argentino. Power spectrum analysis of the deseasonalized discharge revealed significant period peaks in the 33- to 36-month range and in the 42- to 58-month range. The first frequency is probably determined by the anomalous position of the subtropical anticyclones in the Pacific (with 2-5 years recurrence intervals), whereas the remaining frequencies are coincidental with the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) frequency spectrum. Significant squared coherency (> 0.78) between the Santa Cruz River discharge anomalies and the MEI suggests that there is a significant teleconnection between ENSO occurrences in the Pacific and the Perito Moreno Glacier dynamics. El Nino events, for example, appear to have fostered the advancement of the glacier's snout and influenced the recorded damming-rupture sequence. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	BALISTRIERI, LS; MURRAY, JW; PAUL, B				BALISTRIERI, LS; MURRAY, JW; PAUL, B			THE CYCLING OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN THE WATER COLUMN OF LAKE SAMMAMISH, WASHINGTON	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Processes controlling the distribution and mobility of Fe and Mn in Lake Sammamish, Washington, a seasonally anoxic lake, are deduced from a year-long monthly study of physical, chemical, and biological parameters in the lake. Inventories of dissolved Mn and Fe in the bottom waters increase as the redox potential lowers with dissolved Mn inventories during stagnation being much larger than inventories of dissolved Fe. The shapes of the dissolved metal profiles indicate that dissolved Fe is supplied to the hypolimnion during stratification by diffusion of Fe(II) from the sediments into the overlying anoxic water as well as reduction of Fe oxide particles settling through the anoxic water column, while the dominant source of dissolved Mn to the anoxic bottom waters during most of the stratification period appears to be reduction of settling Mn-oxide particles. Inventories of particulate Fe in the hypolimnion during the latter stages of stratification are significantly larger than inventories of particulate Mn. Peaks of particulate Fe and Mn occur in the water column from July through November and particulate Mn peaks always occur at shallower depths than peaks of particulate Fe. Flux calculations suggest that there is a sufficient supply of both oxygen and reduced metal to the particulate zones for metal-oxide precipitation to occur. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that during the sulfidic phase of stagnation dissolved Fe concentrations in the very bottom waters may be controlled by FeS precipitation.					; , James Murray/HCI-3547-2022	Murray, James/0000-0002-8577-7964; 													0024-3590					MAY	1992	37	3					510	528		10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0510	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0510													WOS:A1992JH23500006

Pike ranged in total length from 229 to 784 mm, in mass from 70 to 4250 g, and in age from 1 to 10 years. The population showed a preponderance of 2-5-year olds, with few fish surviving beyond 7 years of age. Growth, in terms of length increase, was similar to that reported for circumpolar populations. Mean total length at 5 years of age was 577 mm, growth rate of young adults was 62.5 mm year(-1), growth was isometric, longevity was 10 years of age, and the adult annual mortality rate was 49%. Growth and mortality characteristics of this riverine population were similar to those estimated for a lacustrine population at the same latitude. Flow thus had little measurable effect on the growth or mortality of pike possibly because of the overwhelming effect of other abiotic variables such as temperature, length of growing season and productivity. Consequently, growth characteristics of lacustrine populations can be used to assess the health and condition of riverine populations.

Daphnia galeata feeding on Scenedesmus and Oscillatoria	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					1st International-Plankton-Ecology-Group Workshop on the Role of Food Quality for Zooplankton	MAR 17-21, 1996	CTR LIMNOL, NIEUWERSLUIS, NETHERLANDS	Int Plankton Ecol Grp	CTR LIMNOL			1. Effects of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus and the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria limnetica as food sources on the growth and reproduction of nine Daphnia galeata clones were studied. A high concentration of these two algae species was fed to Daphnia clones collected from four lakes with varying trophic conditions in a life history experiment. 2. Although Oscillatoria is regarded as a low quality food for Daphnia because of its filamentous morphology and suspected nutritional inadequacy, the cyanobacterium sustained both body growth and reproduction in D. galeata. Growth and reproduction were, however, lower and the onset of reproduction was delayed on a diet of Oscillatoria compared to a diet of Scenedesmus. The intrinsic growth rate, r, for each D. galeata clone was positive on a diet of Oscillatoria, ranging from 0.06 to 0.16 mm day(-1), whereas the intrinsic growth rates on a diet of Scenedesmus ranged from 0.27 to 0.34 mm day(-1). 3. The degree of growth depression on the Oscillatoria diet varied among clones. Clonal responses were correlated with body size; clones with larger body size decreased their growth and reproduction more on a diet of Oscillatoria. The responses of different clones from the same lake to the two diets resembled each other, irrespective of geography or trophic state of the lake.

J	Cook, JE; Jensen, N; Galbraith, B				Cook, James E.; Jensen, Nicholas; Galbraith, Betsy			Compositional, cover, and diversity changes after prescribed fire in a mature eastern white pine forest	BOTANY												Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) forests are considered fire dependent, but little is known about the role of low-intensity fires. We conducted four prescribed burns to examine understory effects. The vegetation was sampled one year before and two consecutive years after the burns. Understory metrics were calculated for the vernal (May-June) and aestival (mid-August) assemblages. The fires resulted in a cumulative mortality rate in the sapling layer of 64%. During the first year, the burns had a neutral or repressive effect oil the understory. However, cover, richness, and species density increased significantly for both assemblages during the second year; however, the relative change was greater for the vernal assemblage. The fires also led to greater compositional turnover than in the controls. The large increases in late-season cover were primarily from reduced competition and enhanced regeneration. The fires created a brief window of invasion Opportunity, which was minimally captured by annuals and exotics. Ordination indicated different short-term successional pathways for the vernal (diverging) and aestival (converging) assemblages. This difference by time period was consistent with similarity measures. The study suggests that low intensity fires play a vital role in understory diversity and structure in white pine forests.																			1916-2790	1916-2804				DEC	2008	86	12					1427	1439		10.1139/B08-111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/B08-111													WOS:000262718600007

Biological Fractionation of Stable Carbon Isotopes at the Aerobic/Anaerobic Water Interface of Meromictic Water Bodies	MICROBIOLOGY												Mass-spectrometric investigation of carbon isotope composition ( delta C-13) was carried out for suspended organic matter and dissolved mineral compounds for the water column of some meromictic water bodies differing in salinity and trophic state. As a rule, a more pronounced carbon isotope fractionation (resulting from the metabolism of phytoplankton and anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria) was revealed in the zones of enhanced oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Carbon isotope fractionation at the border between oxidized and reduced waters depends both on the activity of microbial communities and on the dominant species of phototrophic microorganisms. Analysis of the distribution profiles of the isotopic composition of suspended organic matter and dissolved mineral carbon revealed active mineralization of the organic matter newly formed via anoxygenic photosynthesis in the monimolimnion by microbial communities, resulting in the release of isotopically light carbon dioxide. Mineral carbon in the anaerobic zones of highly productive meromictic water bodies is therefore enriched with the light C-12 isotope.

J	Ramachandra, TV				Ramachandra, T. V.			Spatial Analysis and Characterisation of Lentic Ecosystems: A Case Study of Varthur Lake, Bangalore	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Lentic ecosystems' vital functions such as recycling of nutrients, purification of water, recharge of groundwater, augmenting and maintenance of stream flow and habitat provision for a wide variety of flora and fauna along with their recreation values necessitates their sustainable management through appropriate conservation mechanisms. Failure to restore these ecosystems will result in extinction of species or ecosystem types and cause permanent ecological damage. In Bangalore, lentic ecosystems (for example lakes) have played a prominent role serving the needs of agriculture and drinking water. But the burgeoning population accompanied by unplanned developmental activities has led to the drastic reduction in their numbers (from 262 in 1976 to 81). The existing water bodies are contaminated by residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial wastes/effluents. In order to restore the ecosystem, assessment of the level of contamination is crucial. This paper focuses on characterisation and restoration aspects of Varthur lake based on hydrological, morphometric, physical-chemical and socio-economic investigations for a period of six months covering post monsoon seasons. The results of the water quality analysis show that the lake is eutrophic with high concentrations of phosphorous and organic matter. The morphometric analysis indicates that the lake is shallow in relation to its surface area. Socio-economic analyses show dependence of local residents for irrigation, fodder, etc. These analyses highlight the need and urgency to restore the physical, chemical and biological integrity through viable restoration and sustainable watershed management strategies, which include pollution abatement, catchment treatment, desilting of the lake and educating all stakeholders on the conservation and restoration of lake ecosystems.

A minimum of 183 Tiger Salamander mortalities were recorded on a 1.05 km section of highway. The mean snout-to-vent length of eight road-killed salamanders was 103.1 cm. Movement was concentrated in one 300 m section of highway, primarily in one direction, and related to heavy rainfall events and warm weather.

Elemental ratios (C:N) and stable isotopic composition of dominant rotifer species in a tropical eutrophic alkaline-saline Lake Nakuru (Kenya)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Rotifers dominate zooplankton biomass of many aquatic environments. However, their link to food web biomass has rarely been elucidated in alkaline-saline lakes. Variations in C content, C:N ratio and stable isotope composition (delta C-13, delta N-15) of dominant rotifer species were studied from January to December 2008 in alkaline-saline Lake Nakuru to provide insights into their bioenergetics. We established that Brachionus dimidiatus dominated in terms of abundance (80,000-100,000 x 10(3) ind m(-3)) and C-biomass. Also B. dimidiatus constituted about 60-75% of the rotifer biomass in the samples. All the rotifer species exhibited significant (P\0.05) seasonal differences in biomass, C and C: N ratios. Rotifers had lower mean delta C-13 than course particulate organic matter, fine particulate organic matter and fish, but higher than mean delta C-13 in the dominant phytoplankton species. In all species, delta C-13 and delta N-15 increased markedly during the rainy season reflecting the feeding onset on allochthonous food sources. The isotopic increase correlated with an increase in their C: N. Our results demonstrate that rotifers respond quickly to any increase in primary production and can cope with changes in its nature and timing.

In this study, major non-point sources in surface run-offs, from cultivated lands within the river districts, and their effects on the bodies of water in North Han River Basin were examined. It was found that pollutant concentrations in the run-offs from farms appeared to be generally higher than in the run-offs from paddies. Initial concentrations of pollutants during rainy seasons were usually higher than the medians of their concentration ranges, though not necessarily the highest. The unit loads of BOD from cultivated lands within river districts, which were proposed in this study for the first time in Korea, were 4.56, 3.35, and 10.26 kg/km(2)/year for paddies, farms, and greenhouses, respectively. Likewise the unit loads of total nitrogen (TN) were proposed as 1.54, 8.11, and 5.59 kg/km(2)/year for paddies, farms, and greenhouse, respectively. Meanwhile, the unit loads of Total phosphorus (TP) were 0.71, 2.79, and 1.11 kg/km(2)/year for paddies, farms, and greenhouses, respectively. The unit loads for both BOD and TP from paddies and farms in the North Han River basin were higher than those provided by the Ministry of Environment. It was largely attributable to the regional characteristics of the cultivated area, within the river district, that is adjacent to the water system. Three priority standard watersheds, which were believed to contain higher non-point sources of pollution than other standard watersheds, were recommended to undergo restoration. The sum of the discharged total loads per unit area for BOD, TN, and TP from these three standard watersheds (i.e. NHR M2, NHR1, and NHR M) was 71.8, 71.5, and 73.0%, respectively. Restoring cultivated lands within river districts into grasslands could effectively reduce the total load of TP rather than BOD and TN. Therefore, converting cultivated lands within river districts back to grasslands can be an alternative in effectively reducing pollution in bodies of water.

Of the total Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA), the most predominant fatty acids present in both males and females are palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0) and myristic acid. The difference between the muscles are insignificant (p>0.05). With regard to the Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA), 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7 and 16:1 are predominantly found in the liver. The difference between the kidneys and the gonads are significant (p<0.05) but there is no significant difference between other muscles (p>0.05). Of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, the amount of n-3 PUFA is significantly different in muscle tissues compared with those of other tissues. Similar results were obtained for n-6 PUFA in kidney and for n-3/n-6 proportion in muscle tissues. The examination of the general compositions of the fatty acids reveal an intensification on 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. EPA + DHA amount and PUFA/SFA proportion are the highest in muscle tissue. The least amount of cholesterol on the other hand is found in muscle tissue and there is a significant difference with those of other tissues (p<0.05). The highest amount of K1 and K2 vitamins are found in gonads and D2, D3 and alpha-tocopherol were highest in liver. These analyses are conducted with GC and HPLC.																			1680-5593	1993-601X				JUN 1	2010	9	7					1179	1190																WOS:000277120800019

J	Ottosson, F; Abrahamsson, O				Ottosson, F; Abrahamsson, O			Presentation and analysis of a model simulating epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temperatures in lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												An important factor in aquatic modelling is water temperature. This is especially true for dimictic lakes where stratification and mixing influence many processes and variables, such as oxygen conditions, lake water retention time, etc. This paper evaluates and improves an existing method to predict water temperatures developed by Hakanson,1996 (Ecol. Model., 88:157-181). The method is incorporated in a model simulating water temperatures in epilimnion and hypolimnion. The model is calibrated and validated against an extensive set of empirical data. It is driven by readily available parameters, e.g. latitude, continentality and altitude. The predictive power, especially for the epilimnetic temperature, is such that the model could be used as a sub-model in many models concerning lake ecosystems. However, the model has only been tested for Swedish lakes covering a relatively narrow range in terms of latitude, longitude and altitude and it would be interesting to investigate if this approach also holds for other parts of the world. As an example of how the model can be used in practise, a simulation of retention of caesium in lake water, using the temperature model as a sub-model, is presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	ESTEVES, KE; GALETTI, PM				ESTEVES, KE; GALETTI, PM			FOOD PARTITIONING AMONG SOME CHARACIDS OF A SMALL BRAZILIAN FLOODPLAIN LAKE FROM THE PARANA RIVER BASIN	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Resource partitioning and the seasonal patterns of food intake of four characids (Astyanax fasciatus, A. bimaculatus, A. schubarti and Cheirodon stenodon) were studied during 1988 in a floodplain lake of Mogi-Guacu River, Sao Paulo State. For interspecific comparisons, data of the previously studied Moenkhausia intermedia have also been used. A. fasciatus and A. bimnculatus can be considered omnivorous species, while A. schubarti and C. stenodon are predominantly herbivorous. The river flood cycle (following the wet season October-March and dry season April-September) seems to influence both seasonal food intake and food overlap between species. February-March and September-October are probably the months of highest food availability, and the months preceding these periods have the lowest resource amount. Our study shows that both omnivorous and herbivorous species modified the intensity of their interactions according to this cycle. Omnivorous species maintained fairly segregated diets when resources were presumably limited, and showed a rapid change from distinct food niches in the dry season to widely overlapping ones when resources were presumably more abundant. Conversely, the herbivorous species showed higher overlap during the dry season.

Occurrences of red, hematitic paleosols in the Lochness Formation are compatible with previous interpretations of a weakly oxygenated 1.8 Ga paleoatmosphere. Redoximorphic features in the paleosols suggest a warm to cool temperate paleoclimate (mean annual soil temperature 5-20 degrees C) characterized by seasonal saturation, by analogy with Quaternary redoximorphic soils. A minimal concentration of organic C (at least 1 wt %), possibly of microbial or bacterial origin, must have been present in these Proterozoic soils to allow for Fe reduction.																			1073-130X					OCT 2	1995	65	4					675	689																WOS:A1995TA11100010

The input series are areal precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The output is riverflow. The number of parameters, used in the description of the hydrological phenomena in the catchment, is in most cases three, sometimes four. The statistical methodology used for calibrating the models of given catchments is described; it reduces essentially to regression analysis, including residual analysis, sensitivity to calibration period and extrapolation test. In particular, automatic calibration is used, excluding subjective elements. The models are applied to 79 river basins in Belgium, China and Burma. The results are compared with four similar models taken from the literature. The results of applying the new models are satisfactory from a statistical point of view and are much better than those quoted in the literature; a greater part of the observed runoff is explained and there is no residual seasonality. This results from the different mathematical' structure of the models, and especially from the use, in the published models, of several storages with maximum 'capacities', with no distinction between slow and fast runoff corresponding to baseflow and direct runoff, respectively.

J	Colvin, MA				Colvin, MA			Population and fishery characteristics of white bass in four large Missouri reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT					130th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	AUG, 2000	St Louis, MO	Amer Fisheries Soc				The population and fishery characteristics of white bass Morone chrysops were determined for four large Missouri reservoirs to help establish meaningful objectives for white bass fisheries. The growth of white bass in Table Rock and Bull Shoals lakes was faster and a higher proportion of fish were larger than 380 mm than in Pomme de Terre Lake and Lake of the Ozarks. Age-4 white bass exceeded 400 mm at Table Rock and Bull Shoals lakes and averaged about 370 mm in the other two. When gender differences in growth could be examined, female white bass grew faster than males in Pomme de Terre Lake and Lake of the Ozarks and were 12-20 mm longer than males for ages 3 and older. Mean relative weights were at least 90 in all reservoirs and exceeded 100 in Table Rock and Bull Shoals lakes. The age structures of white bass populations were similar among all four reservoirs: fish up to age 7 were present, but there was a sharp decline in abundance after age 4. Variable recruitment strongly affected size and age structure in all reservoirs. Total annual mortality, calculated from consecutive years of gill netting, was about 40% through age 4 and 80% thereafter. Tagging studies at Pomme de Terre Lake and Lake of the Ozarks indicated that angler exploitation rates varied annually, ranging from about 15% to 35%. Creel surveys indicated that anglers released most white bass less than 230 mm and that white bass were first harvested at age 1 toward the end of their second growing season. When compared with fish in other reservoirs in southern states, the white bass in these reservoirs exhibited good growth and had moderate rates of total mortality and exploitation.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2002	22	2					677	689		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0677:PAFCOW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0677:PAFCOW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000175869600035

Physico-chemical fouling of membranes depends on characteristics of the raw water and membrane surface properties. In the case of Biwa lake, some chemical parameters as Si and Fe concentrations change with temperature (season) causing irreversible fouling. While some exist on the influence of the particle mineralogy on the fouling, little work has been developed to elucidate the relation between the physicochemical complexity of the cake and the fouling. Generally clays or oxides are known to lead to a reversible fouling. In this work, the interactions between a UF organic membrane with minerals leading to a hardly reversible fouling are studied. In the case of the :Biwa lake water, fouling of ultrafiltration membranes results from the formation of a Si-rich ferric gel directly deposited on the membrane surface and a secondary allophanic gel layer at a bigger distance. The deposit nature and the membrane/cake interactions were studied using infra-red, X-ray diffraction, Al and Si NMR and EXAFS technics. The effect of mineral particles, especially ferric oxides associated with silica, has been demonstrated. The formation of FeSi gel directly on the membrane surface is mainly responsible for the fouling. The change of these particles is less negative than the membrane surface. The structure of such a material is complex. The low permeability of the gel is at the prime origin of the fouling.					; ROSE, Jerome/J-5063-2017	BARRES, Odile/0000-0002-6930-4315; ROSE, Jerome/0000-0003-3071-8147													0376-7388					JUL 23	1997	130	1-2					53	62		10.1016/S0376-7388(96)00353-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0376-7388(96)00353-5													WOS:A1997XN89900007

Mean HNF biomass was 7.4 mu g C l(-1), ranging from 0.1 to 41.1 mu g C l(-1). Ingestion rates on heterotrophic bacteria, estimated on the basis of uptake of fluorescently labeled bacteria, were 2.2 to 26.5 cells HNF-1 h(-1) (mean: 7.5 cells HNF-1 h(-1)). Resulting grazing rates only made up between 0.3 and 20 % (mean: 5 %) of bacterial secondary production, and it was evident that heterotrophic nanoflagellates were not able to control bacterial production, indicating that factors other than HNF grazing must play an important role for the mortality of bacteria in the investigated system. A consequence of the fact that only a mean of 0.09 mu g bacterial carbon l(-1) h(-1) was consumed by HNF was that transfer of picoplanktonic carbon to higher trophic levels via HNF was negligible. HNF could not function as a link between the microbial compartment and the classical pelagic food chain, even if nanoflagellates themselves were under strong predatory control, which was indicated by experiments conducted to compare flagellate gross and net growth rates. Another finding was that HNF covered only a mean of 21 % of their carbon demand by the consumption of bacteria, despite high abundance of bacterial carbon as a food source. The error potential of the applied methods was estimated in view of the carbon budget of the bacteria-HNF interaction. This still implied that HNF had to use other carbon sources to a remarkable degree in order to maintain production. The possibility that dissolved organic matter (DOM) may represent a major energy source covering HNF carbon demand is discussed.

J	Simon, M; Wünsch, C				Simon, M; Wünsch, C			Temperature control of bacterioplankton growth in a temperate large lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In order to examine the significance of temperature in controlling growth of bacterioplankton in a large lake with a pronounced pelagic zone we performed 12 temperature shift-up experiments year-round in mesotrophic Lake Constance, Germany, with samples from 1, 6, 10 or 20 and 50 m depth. We measured incorporation of C-14-leucine (Leu) and H-3-thymidine (TdR) at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C including the in situ temperature +/-2 degrees C. The results show that during most of the year bacteria at 1 and 6 m were well adapted to the ambient temperature, ranging between 4 and 23 degrees C, because in situ and optimum growth temperatures agreed within 1 to 5 degrees C. At 28 and 50 m, in situ and optimum growth temperatures usually diverged by more than 5 degrees C, and often by more than 10 degrees C, indicating that bacterial growth at these depths was clearly Limited by temperature. Hence, in the upper water column, temperature controlled bacterial growth by selecting for a well-temperature-adapted community whereas in the lower part of the water column temperature directly controlled bacterial growth. In several experiments we observed 2 temperature optima. We interpret this observation as an indication of the existence of 2 different subpopulations with different temperature preferences. Q(10) values of Leu incorporation and TdR incorporation, ranging from 1.4 to 42.5, exhibited systematic differences. At 1, 6 and 10 m, Q(10) of Leu was higher than that of TdR except in 3 cases, whereas at 20 and 50 m Q(10) of TdR was higher than that of Leu except in 3 cases. This observation suggests that protein synthesis (Leu) and DNA replication (TdR) are controlled differently by temperature in differently adapted bacterial communities. In order to test the hypothesis that utilization of the most important substrates is optimized at the optimum growth temperature we carried out 5 additional experiments in which we measured uptake and respiration of dissolved free amino acids and monosaccharides. In 3 experiments we found that the fraction of amino acids respired had a distinct minimum at the optimum growth temperature whereas respiration of monosaccharides had such a minimum only in 1 experiment. The experiments gave no indication of enhanced respiration percentages at minimum growth temperatures.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				NOV 27	1998	16	2					119	130		10.3354/ame016119	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame016119													WOS:000077727000003

The scope of the study was to examine and assess the ecological risk of toxic metals such as Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn which are observed in the sediments collected from 10 different sample points of Sapanca Lake. Accumulation levels of toxic metals concentrations in the sediment samples were dissolved by using the microwave method and then measured with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The levels of toxic metal concentrations were identified as Fe > Al > Zn > Ba > Ni > Cr > As > Pb > Cu > Co > Cd, from highest to lowest, respectively. The quality of sediment is determined as "uncontaminated" according to The Sediment Quality Guidelines. Furthermore, sediment pollution is found not to be at toxic level. In addition, the sediments were evaluated by using following pollution indices: contamination factor, enrichment factor (EF) and geo-accumulation index. According to EF pollution index, higher rates for As and Cd indicate the presence of anthropogenic activities such as the consumption of fuel-oil in the industry and traffic.

The present work explored seasonal and spatial dynamics of bacterial communities in a large CW used for river water treatment and the associated environmental variables. Quantitative PCR assay and high-throughput sequencing analysis were used to determine the abundance, richness, diversity, and structure of wetland bacterial community. Bacterial abundance was correlated to nitrite and temperature, while bacterial diversity could be influenced by pH as well as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Bacterial community structure might be shaped by nitrogen and phosphorus. A considerable difference in bacterial community composition existed between wetland soils and sediments. Proteobacteria (accounting for 33-60%) was the largest bacterial phylum, and Chloroflexi (5-24%) was also abundant. The abundance, richness, diversity, and composition of the bacterial community were influenced by wetland plant type and wetland trophic status.					liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008	Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080													1590-4261	1869-2044				JUN	2019	69	6					637	645		10.1007/s13213-019-01454-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-019-01454-x													WOS:000468028800006
J	Bidwell, MT; Dawson, RD				Bidwell, MT; Dawson, RD			Calcium availability limits reproductive output of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in a nonacidified landscape	AUK												Breeding birds require high levels of energy and certain nutrients, such as calcium. The extent to which calcium limits reproduction in wild birds is unclear. We performed a supplementation experiment to determine whether calcium limits the reproductive output of free-ranging insectivorous Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a species whose usual diet contains little calcium. Providing supplemental calcium in the form of crushed oyster shell did not affect clutch initiation date, but it caused birds that had not started constructing a nest when we first detected them on the study area to begin laying sooner, which suggests that calcium reduced the length of the prelaying period. Supplemented females produced larger eggs, and that effect was most pronounced among females in good body condition. There was a trend for supplemented birds to produce larger clutches, and their clutches had significantly greater total mass than those of control birds. Supplemented birds, in particular those breeding late in the season, also hatched significantly more eggs. Our results suggest that calcium availability may limit some aspects of avian reproduction, even in nonacidified landscapes like our study area, where levels of calcium in the soil are high.

It was found that the total number of neustonic bacteria (TNB) varied from 1.28 x 10(6) to 1.98 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) and was from 1.4 to 2.0 times higher than the number of planktonic bacteria (P < 0.001). TNB range for planktonic bacteria oscillated between 0.75 x 10(6) cells ml(-1.) The number of heterotrophic neustonic (SM) bacteria (CFU 22 degrees C) was also higher by 2.0 to 13.3 times (P < 0.001) being between 1.48 and 12.5 x 10(3) cells ml(-1) while the CFU of bacteria of bacteria in the SSW oscillated between 0.35 to 0.94 x 10(3) cells ml(-1). Both the values of TNB and CFU displayed a distinct seasonal variation (P < 0.001). However, the rate of secondary production of planktonic bacteria was higher (from 1.1 to 6.0 times) than the rate of production of neustonic bacteria (P < 0.05) and displayed seasonal variability (P < 0.001). The rate of secondary production in subsurface water ranged from 0.676 to 1.265 mu gC l(-1) h(-1) while in surface microlayer from 0.118 to 0.597 mu gC l(-1) h(-1)while in surface microlayer from 0.118 to 0.597 mu gC l(-1) h(-1).

J	Ibanez, MDR				Ibanez, MDR			Phytoplankton composition and abundance of a central Amazonian floodplain lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The phytoplankton community of Lake Camaleao, a small floodplain lake influenced by a large white water river, the Solimoes, was monthly investigated for the composition and abundance of its phytoplankton. The seasonal influence of the flood regime on biomass, species richness and diversity, and its relation with physical and chemical factors (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, total seston and inorganic nutrients) was analyzed and subjected to principal component analysis. Diversity was variable along the seasonal cycle: relatively high values were observed at the end of the dry season supported by high nutrient concentrations. The phytoplankton was comprised of 262 taxa, with strong dominance of euglenoids (81%). The three sample stations did not differ among each other, except in the dry season, due to data cluster in relation to the principal axis (1 and 2), explaining 63% of the variation. Biomass accumulation as a function of lake area reduction contributed to these results, indicating that the phytoplankton dynamics were hydrology-driven.																			0018-8158						1998	362						79	83																WOS:000073970000008
J	Verschuren, D; Edgington, DN; Kling, HJ; Johnson, TC				Verschuren, D; Edgington, DN; Kling, HJ; Johnson, TC			Silica depletion in Lake Victoria: Sedimentary signals at offshore stations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Six short sediment cores from offshore stations in Lake Victoria (East Africa) were analyzed for evidence of recent change in the lake's pelagic ecosystem. Three stations were located on a NW-SE transect between 48 m water depth, near the present upper limit of seasonal hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, and the deepest point of Lake Victoria at 68 m. Four stations formed a NE-SW transect across the east-central zone of maximum Holocene sediment accumulation below 64 m water depth. (210)Pb dating of two cores from deepwater stations established average recent sediment accummulation rates of 0.032 +/- 0.001 g/cm(2)/yr and 0.028 +/- 0.001 g/cm(2)/yr. Although the deepest part of the basin has been subject to an event of possibly widespread sediment erosion dated to the mid-1920s, core correlation based on the stratigraphy of biogenic Si above this unconformity indicates that deepwater stations have accumulated representative high-resolution archives of lake history over the past 70 years. The sedimentary record of biogenic-Si accumulation in deepwater cores reflects a sequence of events in which progressive enrichment of Lake Victoria with essential nutrients other than Si first led to increased diatom production, until the combination of excess Si demand and greater burial losses of diatom-Si resulted in depletion of the dissolved-Si reservoir and a transition to Si-limited diatom growth, Available sediment chronologies infer that increased diatom production in offshore areas started between the 1930s and early 1950s, and that the recently documented phytoplankton transition to year-round dominance by cyanobacteria started in the late 1980s. Excess diatom production over the past half century has led to significantly higher burial losses of biogenic Si only in the depositional center of the basin at water depths below 60 m.

J	Graham, NE				Graham, NE			Late-Holocene teleconnections between tropical Pacific climatic variability and precipitation in the western USA: evidence from proxy records	HOLOCENE												Decadal to multidecadal fluctuations between drought and relatively more moist conditions are a defining characteristic of precipitation variability in the western USA. In an attempt to better understand the forcing mechanisms responsible for producing this variability, relationships between proxy indices of tropical climatic variability and precipitation-related reconstructions in the western USA are examined. The tropical proxies include the delta(18)O record from the Quelccaya ice cap (southern Subtropical Andes) and the lacustrine sedimentation record from Laguna Pallcacocha (near-equatorial Andes). The precipitation-related records are tree-ring reconstructions of river flow, drought severity and precipitation over the contiguo USA. One new finding is a consistent relation between decadal variability in El Nino activity and precipitation-related proxies through much of the western USA during the past 1200 years. Surprisingly, the proxy records do not show a systematic link between inferred El Nino activity and precipitation in the interior Southwest USA. A second new result is the existence of relationships at decadal- to multidecadal timescales between fluctuations in Quelccaya delta(18)O, precipitation-related proxies from the western USA, and proxy records from the Pacific Basin. This finding links the Quelccaya record to the transhemispheric Pacific decadal-scale climatic variability documented from proxy records by Villalba et al (2001), and suggests that similar changes in the large-scale circulation changes accompany both the decadal and multidecadal signals. A composite constructed using gridded proxy precipitation constructed on the basis of decadal-scale fluctuations in inferred-El Nino activity shows a pattern rather different to Nino-based teleconnection maps for the instrumental record. In the proxy-based composite, positive values cover much of the extreme western, west central and southeastern USA, with negative values in the central Mississippi Valley. The interior Southwest shows essentially no response. A second composite based on multidecadal variability in Quelccaya delta(18)O shows a well-developed dipole pattern across the western USA with opposing centres in the interior Southwest and Northwest. It is suggested that this dipole pattern results from multidecadal variability in tropical Pacific SSTs and resulting changes in the strength of the Northeast Pacific High and the latitudinal distribution of cool season westerlies across the eastern North Pacific and western USA.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2004	14	3					436	447		10.1191/0959683604hl719xx	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl719xx													WOS:000221524900011
J	Kangmin, LI				Kangmin, LI			Management and restoration of fish communities in Lake Taihu, China	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												The economic development of the cities around Lake Taihu, China, has caused both environmental changes and ecological succession. The biodiversity of Lake Taihu has declined since 1970. Migratory fish, including anadromous, catadromous and semi-migratory fish,are either extinct or on the verge of extinction in Lake Taihu. Only lake dwellers persist. Several measures have been taken, such as restocking, closed seasons, sanctuaries for enhancement and even introductions to restore some original fish communities. Although these measures have achieved a certain degree of success, increased fishing activities or over-fishing have offset the benefits obtained. Moreover, cultural eutrophication of the lake and the pollution of the waterways connected with the lake are getting worse. This jeopardizes the remaining economically valuable species in the lake. Measures are required not only to control eutrophication and pollution, and to reduce the intensity of fishing, but also to address the wider biodiversity issues.																			0969-997X					FEB	1999	6	1					71	81		10.1046/j.1365-2400.1999.00120.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.1999.00120.x													WOS:000082699100006

The climate model employs more detailed prescriptions of land-ocean boundaries, topography, and inland lakes and seas than were used in previous climate simulations of supercontinents with idealized land-ocean boundaries and no topography. The presence of mountains and plateaus and of inland seas and lakes produce large differences in the simulated climate compared to simulations that omit these features. Mountains and plateaus become focal points for enhanced precipitation and also help to intensify the monsoon circulations. Extensive inland seas and lakes exert a strong local damping of the seasonal range of temperature and also cause changes beyond the lakes region due to dynamical and hydrological effects. Using the climate-biome classification scheme of Walter, the simulated distribution of climates-biomes is compared to the observed distribution of Late Permian vegetation-biomes. Agreement is good in all but two areas.																			0962-8436					AUG 28	1993	341	1297					327	340		10.1098/rstb.1993.0118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1993.0118													WOS:A1993LW69300021

Abundance was greatest and most variable at sites near larval habitats. Rainfall and an index combining rainfall and temperature predicted adult female abundance near larval habitats 7-15 d in advance. The spatial distribution of population abundance seemed to be influenced strongly by local factors, because temporal change at sampling sites located >10 km apart was asynchronous.

J	Howland, KL; Tallman, RF; Tonn, WM				Howland, KL; Tallman, RF; Tonn, WM			Migration patterns of freshwater and anadromous inconnu in the Mackenzie River system	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Radiotelemetry, long-term seasonal gillnetting, and a synthesis of existing historical data revealed that both freshwater and anadromous inconnu Stenodus leucichthys in the Mackenzie River system are migratory, but their feeding/overwintering habitats and the timing and distance of their spawning migrations differ substantially. An anadromous population (Arctic Red River) began upstream migration 2-2.5 months earlier and spawned approximately 3 weeks earlier than did a freshwater population (Slave River), likely because of latitudinal differences in temperature regimes and the additional distance required by anadromous inconnu to reach spawning grounds. Little mixing occurred between anadromous inconnu in the lower Mackenzie River and freshwater inconnu in the Great Slave Lake area, and based on tagging data, a third fluvial form may exist in the upper Mackenzie River. Inconnu in the lower Mackenzie migrate more extensively and use both coastal areas and the outer Mackenzie Delta for feeding and overwintering, whereas inconnu in the Great Slave Lake area feed and overwinter in the lake and migrate shorter distances to spawn. Given these differences and the importance of inconnu for both domestic and commercial use, future research should focus on both the genetic and life history differences of the two migratory forms.

The phosphate speciation was determined by sequential extraction method. The concentration of phosphate in solution was measured by the ammonium molybdate method with ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. Water and sediment (surface and bottom) were sampled at eight points around the lake by taking into account activities around the lake during dry and rainy seasons. The results showed five forms of phosphorus presents in the sediments. The rank order obtained was Res-P < P-L < P-OM < P-Ca < P-Fe with the prevalence of inorganic phosphorus (P-L + P-Ca + P-Fe) than organic phase. The average phosphorus (P) content was 133, 86, and 52 mu g g(-1) for the surface layer (A, 0-5 cm), medium layer (B, 5-10 cm), and bottom layer (C, 10-15 cm), respectively. This P-content depletion with depth can be explained mainly by oxygen depletion with depth which enhance P desorption. Except P-L form, the P contents were higher in rainy season compared to the dry season. The results of principal component analysis indicate that inorganic phosphorus (P-L + P-Ca + P-Fe) were linked and were provided mainly by car-washing. It appears clearly that phosphorus content vary significantly during the seasons. These results showed also that the amount of (P-Fe) is higher than the others whatever the season. This P form is easily labile and bioavailable which suggest that it can unfortunately enhance greatly the eutrophication of Lake Dang.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2015	22	4					3098	3106		10.1007/s11356-014-3586-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3586-0								25233918					WOS:000349319200072

Hydrochemical and isotopic investigation of a tropical wetland system in the Indian subcontinent	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The study reported here is a part of an attempt to establish a comprehensive hydrochemical and isotopic baseline for a tropical wetland system as background data for a range of applications. Surface water samples of Vembanad Lake were collected from 20 stations in three seasons during the period 2007-2009. The analytical results were subjected to different chemical classification techniques to understand processes affecting the chemical concentration of waters. The Piper diagram classified the water samples as 100% alkali group in pre-monsoon followed by 15% in monsoon and 85% in post-monsoon, and for anions 100% samples were of strong acids followed by 90% in monsoon and 100% in post-monsoon season. The plot to decipher the mechanism controlling water chemistry placed the Vembanad Lake in the region of precipitation and rock dominance in the monsoon season and in the field of saline water dominance in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season. The positive values for the chloro-alkaline indices in pre and post-monsoon season promoted cation exchange in the system. The stable isotopes of water samples ranged from -20.21 to +17.0aEuro degrees and -5.6 to +3.34aEuro degrees for delta H-2 and delta O-18, respectively. The most depleted delta values observed in the monsoon are due to the amount effect. The high enrichment observed in pre-monsoon is primarily due to evaporation and salinity mixing. The variation of isotopes in the whole system point toward the fact that salinity mixing can be indicated by the delta O-18 variation and delta H-2 indicates the evaporation effect. The plot of delta O-18 with chloride concentration showed precipitation dominance in the monsoon season, mixing of saline water and evaporation in pre-monsoon season, whereas the post-monsoon samples plot in both fresh and saline region.

Temporal influence on foraging strategies, territoriality and nomadic tendencies of Snail Kite, Rosthramus sociabilis (Viellot, 1817) in an urban Neotropical wetland	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The foraging, territoriality and displacement of the Snail Kite were studied over 232 hours of observations in an urban lake during the dry and wet seasons. The temperature and rainfall variations were used to correlate with predation rates and the correlation coefficients were 0,39 and 0,34, respectively. Snail Kites spent more time foraging during the wet than the dry season when perching is more frequently recorded. The higher predation in the wet season can be explained by the higher abundance of apple snails and the energy demand for reproduction. In the wet season, the territories were smaller and the conspecific conflicts decreased as prey were more available. However, due to the lack of food in the dry season, intra-specific conflicts and expansion of male territories were observed and the female and immatures were expelled from their foraging area to another location. In this way, site tenacity of Snail Kites should be interpreted in relation to the variations on food and dominance gradients according to the temporal changes (time) and foraging sites (space).

J	Paramore, LM; Rulifson, RA				Paramore, LM; Rulifson, RA			Dorsal coloration as an indicator of different life history patterns for striped bass within a single watershed of Atlantic Canada	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The striped bass Morone saxatilis spawning within a single river system are generally considered to be members of a single population unit. For some rivers in Canada, however, fishers have reported different-colored groups of striped bass in the watershed during the prespawning and spawning seasons, which suggests the existence of population subgroups. We examined this "colormorph' phenomenon for a striped bass population in the Shubenacadie watershed of Nova Scotia. Canada. Spawning fish had three dorsal coloration patterns: green. which was indicative of fish from the ocean; black, which was indicative of fish that overwinter in a freshwater headwater lake: and mottled, which were fish of unknown origin. Body morphology appeared to be similar among the three groups. Although the age structures of the spawning populations revealed a wider range of age-classes among greenbacked fish, the growth aspects (e.g., length, weight, and length at age) were similar. We estimated that during the prespawning period. one-third of the population was actively foraging in the river; stomach contents suggested differences in diet among the morphs. Fatty acid analysis of gonadal material revealed significant differences between the green and black color types, indicating moderately long (months) separation and differences in feeding (i.e., ocean-based versus freshwater-based food webs). Otolith microchemistry analysis of strontium revealed that dorsal coloration at capture was indicative of long-term habitat separation. Whether these two groups are reproductively isolated is unknown.

Using beach seines, we quantified the annual, seasonal, and spatial variation in density and biomass of the entire assemblage and of component species over a 4-year period. Potential prey fish availability was inferred from the biomass of the cumulative total fish length groups and sizes of fish eaten by piscivores. Total fish density and biomass averaged 10,024 fish/ha and 276.3 kg/ha, respectively. Density and biomass of total fish varied among years and seasons, but seasonal patterns differed among years. Yellow perch Perca flavescens, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, wall-eye Stizostedion vitreum, and common carp Cyprinus carpio were the predominant species overall, but the proportional species composition of both total density and total biomass varied highly. Changes in the fish assemblage resulted in dramatic changes in the potential availability of prey fish over time and with piscivore size. These dynamics could lead to variable growth and condition of resident piscivores as well as to variable success of stocking fingerling piscivores.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2001	21	4					884	896		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0884:DOTLFA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0884:DOTLFA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289300018
J	Nocera, JJ; Burgess, NM				Nocera, JJ; Burgess, NM			Diving schedules of Common Loons in varying environments	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Many species of diving birds adjust their foraging behaviour in response to variation in their environment. The Common Loon (Gavia immer) is a visually oriented predator sensitive to environmental variation, yet little is known about the flexibility of its diving behaviour. We tested the hypothesis that loons adjust their diving schedules by increasing or decreasing the dive duration during foraging bouts to accommodate environmental variation during the breeding season. The dive duration and dive-pause components of the loon dive cycle did not vary among lakes with different lake chemistry, lake morphometry, mercury levels in their blood, or fish abundance. We observed some variation among loons in different stages of breeding in mean dive-pause intervals. The dive-pause component of the diving cycle of Common Loons does not seem to be related to the amount of time spent underwater. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a nonlinear relationship in diving birds. We propose that loons vary the components of their diving behaviour independently and seem to alter their diving time budgets regardless of the external stimuli we addressed. This unresponsive diving schedule may make loons susceptible to catastrophic changes in prey densities within their foraging areas, as they are obliged to forage on one, or very few, lakes. Conversely, loons may only forage in lakes with fish abundance above a certain minimum threshold and preferentially avoid lakes with reduced prey abundance.

The aim of this paper was to compare in situ phytoplankton growth with the influence of the addition of nitrates and phosphates into original waters on the growth potential of C. kessleri in Lake Sakadas. Materials and Methods: Samples were collected once a month from March to December 1999, from a site in the central part of Lake Sakadas. The "tubular-chamber" method was used for the quantitative analysis of phytoplankton. Fresh weight phytoplankton biomass. was calculated from the volume of phytoplankton units. Miniaturized bioassay method was used to establish the algal growth potential of C. kessleri. Results: The total microphytoplankton biomass in situ varied from 682 to 115.62mg/l. The following sequences in the phytoplankton successions were evident: Bacillariophyceae community (March); Dinobryon community (April); depression of phytoplankton (May); algal bloom of blue greens (July); Synura bloom (September); Euglenophyceae community (October-December). Results of the AGP of C. kessleri showed that the addition of nitrates caused a statistically significant increase in AGP. The addition of phosphates did not have an influence on the AGP only in June, September and October. Conclusion: The in situ microphytoplankton biomass dynamics as well as the qualitative composition and seasonal succession of phytoplankton indicate eutrophic conditions of Lake Sakadas. According to the results of the AGP of C, kessleri, the water of Lake Sakadas can be classified as highly productive and the algal growth was N-limited.																			0031-5362					SEP	2003	105	3					307	312																WOS:000186263600017
J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV			A practical approach to predict the duration of the growing season for European lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This work presents the first practically useful models to estimate the duration of the growing season (CS in days) for European lakes. GS is a fundamental parameter in limnology, where it is used, e.g., to calculate lake characteristic annual primary production (in g ww/m(2.)yr) from measurement data in g C/l(.)day. We have presented two simple empirical regression equations where GS is estimated from latitude. We have also introduced a more comprehensive model. It is derived from a previously presented well calibrated and validated model predicting lake epilimnetic temperatures from readily available data on latitude, altitude, continentality (distance from the Sea) and lake volume. Operationally, the duration of the growing season (GS in days) is defined from the predicted number of days when epilimentic water temperatures are higher than 9 degreesC. The two modelling approaches are based on different presuppositions and they have been derived and tested from different data-sets. A model comparison has shown that the overall correspondence in predicted GS-values between the methods is very good. Evidently, the more comprehensive model can provide more relevant GS-predictions for many lakes since it also accounts for differences among lakes in altitude, continentality and volume.

Unexpected flooding throughout the refuge in 1993 also allowed us to evaluate the effects of loss of escape cover (i.e., robust emergent wetland vegetation) on deer movements and activity. Although >70% of diurnal locations occurred in escape cover in 1992, use of escape cover was <28% in 1993 as a result of unexpected flooding that rendered most escape cover unavailable to deer. In 1992, hunted deer remained in areas similar to those used before the hunting season and responded to presence and activity of hunters by moving farther into escape cover. In 1993, deer moved to adjacent private lands when availability of escape cover decreased on the refuge. Deer located on private lands increased movements during the hunting season. In 1992, deer exhibited diurnal activity patterns before and during hunting seasons; crepuscular activity patterns were observed before and during hunting seasons in 1993. Differences in activity patterns before hunting seasons in 1992 and 1993 indicated that availability of escape cover was the major factor influencing deer activity patterns.

We evaluated the effect of elevated soil temperatures on C losses from a forest Spodosol by incubating soil cores from surface (Oa + A + E) and subsurface (Bhs) horizons at two seasonal temperature regimes. One regime simulated the normal course of soil temperatures in northern lower Michigan, and the other simulated soil temperatures representing an amount of warming that might occur under some global warming theory calculations. We measured the amounts of CO2-C respired and dissolved organic C leached from the soil cores during a 33-wk period. Microbial respiration rates, after adjustment for variation in initial rates, were significantly increased by soil warming and were greater in surface than in subsurface horizons. Warming significantly increased cumulative C respired, with greater losses from surface soils (greater than or equal to 50 mg C g(-1) C) as compared with subsurface soils (less than or equal to 25 mg C g(-1) C). Mean quantities of dissolved organic C leached, ranging from 2.3 to 3.2 mg C g(-1) C, did not differ significantly by soil horizon or temperature regime. Increased microbial respiration in surface soil horizons was the process most responsive to soil warming in the Spodosol samples we examined. Whether this is a short-term effect that would disappear once pools of labile C are exhausted, or represents a long-term response to soil warming, remains uncertain.					; Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012	Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337; 													0361-5995					JAN-FEB	1999	63	1					211	218		10.2136/sssaj1999.03615995006300010030x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1999.03615995006300010030x													WOS:000079359600030

Phytoplankton primary production in several karst lakes in central Russia	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The phytoplankton primary production was studied in different types of six soft-water, weakly-mineralized karst lakes: Kschara, Sankhar, Yukhor, Poridovo, Svetlen'koye, and Bol'shiye Garavy (Vladimir oblast). The following aspects were studied: seasonal dynamics, vertical distribution of the photosynthetic intensity, relative algal photosynthetic activity, the relationships between production processes and water transparency, BOD5, and the concentrations of total forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. It was revealed that the maximal photosynthesis rate depends more on the total nitrogen than on the total phosphorus. A close correlation was found between the maximal photosynthesis rate and BOD5.

Seasonal primary production cycle in Lake Onega	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												A long-term average curve of seasonal changes in the primary production of phytoplankton in the pelagial zone of Lake Onega has been plotted on the basis of experimental data approximated by a prescribed function. Long-term average values of primary production for each day of the growing season and its integrated and daily average values for different periods of the season have been calculated. Interannual variation of the seasonal process of primary production has been analyzed, and its quantitative estimations are given. The influence of basic environmental factors on the seasonal dynamics of primary production is discussed.					; Maria, Syarki/J-5134-2018; Tekanova, Elena/Z-4632-2019	Tekanova, Elena/0000-0003-0030-3565; 													1062-3590	1608-3059				OCT	2008	35	5					536	540		10.1134/S1062359008050166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359008050166													WOS:000259771900016

Differences in the isotopic composition of SO42- in the water column and small variations in the concentration of this ion were observed in the Turawa reservoir. The investigations did not show vertical variation in the watercolumn concentrations and isotopic composition. This is due to the small depths of the reservoir and mixing of water. A part of sulfate sulfur from the water column is reduced by incorporating it into cell structures, while a part of it is deposited in the sediment. The study revealed a small exchange of SO42- between the water column and the sediment. Depending on the season of the year and the sediment sampling site, biogeochemical transformations of sulfur species are observed. A significant variation in the biogeochemical processes was found between the Siemianowka and Sulejow reservoirs, both in the concentrations and in the isotopic composition of particular sulfur species. This primarily results from the different characteristics of either of these reservoirs (flows, sedimentation, and material discharge to the lake). The main source of sulfur supplied to the sediments in the Siemianowka reservoir is organic sulfur contained in organic matter deposited at the bottom. In the sediment, organic sulfur is bacterially oxidized and fixed as SO42-. This is manifested in a substantial enrichment of sulfate in S-34. The presence of polysulfides was found in both reservoirs, but a distinct depletion of delta(34) S(S2-) in the light sulfur isotope was observed in the Siemianowka reservoir. In a part of the Sulejow reservoir, polysulfides are oxidized to SO42-, probably at the sediment/water interface.

Effects of Passive Hydration on Surface Water and Groundwater Storages in Drained Ranchland Wetlands in the Everglades Basin in Florida	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Pre-(1 year) and post-(2 years) passive hydration data were used to evaluate the effects on spatiotemporal storages at two pastoral wetlands in the Lake Okeechobee (LO) watershed within the Everglades basin, Florida, United States. To partially restore the predrainage wetland storage and hydroperiod, passive hydration was implemented by raising the discharge elevation using a culvert structure with removable boards at the end of the drainage ditch that drained the wetland/upland system. During the wet season (July-October) groundwater and total storages (surface water plus groundwater; rainfall normalized) in the wetland footprints increased 17 and 12% during the post-hydration periods at wetland 1. At wetland 2, these increases were 39 and 12%, respectively. When analyzed at the subwatershed (wetland plus upland) scale, total storages (rainfall normalized) during wet season increased 12% in both wetlands in the posthydration periods. Annual surface storage (rainfall normalized) increased from 25 to 188 m(3) for wetland 1, whereas at wetland 2, it increased from 0.2 to 6 m(3) during posthydration periods (annual) at subwatershed level. Differences in rainfall, storage areas, topography, and wetland hydrology masked the hydration effects and resulted in inconsistent results across years and wetlands. At the LO watershed-scale, increased storage was only 14% of the desired storage. Long-term data are needed before implementation of passive hydration for achieving storage goals.

This study investigated influence of reclaiming wetland to soybean or paddy field on microbial biomass and activity in peat mire soil around the lake. After reclamation, in 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm soil layers microbial biomass and activities decreased due to reclamation. MBC (Microbial Biomass Carbon), MBN (Microbial Biomass Nitrogen), MBC/MBN, BR (Basal Respiration) all decreased. But before and after reclamation, microbial biomass decreased with soil depth, seasonal variations of microbial biomass and MBC/MBN were similar, higher in May to June than those in July to September. In 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm topsoil layers in May to July, qCO(2)(Respiration Quotient-qCO(2)) was higher in soybean field than that in paddy field and wetland, both were in water logging; while in August and September logging water was drained up, qCO(2) in paddy field increased dramatically to be higher than that in soybean field and wetland. In 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm subsoil layers, qCO(2) were higher in wetland and paddy field than that in soybean filed from May to September. Changes of plant type, litter amount and quality derived from reclamation influenced the microbial biomass and activity seriously. Moreover, situation of water logging was found to be the key factor influencing microbial activity.

All females and ephippia (modified moulting exuvia of females containing resting eggs) from the late Early/early Middle Miocene Randeck Maar (about 17-15 m.y.a., mammal zone MN5) and ephippia from the Late Oligocene lacustrian locality Rott (23-24 m.y.a., mammal zome MP30) belong to Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) Dybowski et Grochowski, 1895. We conclude that these cladocerans were very common in European Eocene-Miocene water bodies. In case of German volcanogenic Maars, numerous ephippia of Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia), including their clusters, in a fossil layer could indicate shallow water conditions and seasonality in such water body.

Glaciers form an important component of this frozen part of the Earth's system. They exist over a prolonged period and are largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth. The meltwater from the glaciers during warmer seasons contribute to the river systems in absence of other sources. The run-off is also useful for agriculture, power generation, and is rich in alluvium. Retreating glaciers gives rise to pro-glacial lakes formed by damming action of moraine or ice. Rupturing of ice dams have caused serious damage to infrastructure and human lives in the past. Such useful and dynamic characteristics of a glacier motivate us to study its movement. Monitoring glaciers through in-situ field measurements is a cumbersome process. Over the past decade, glaciers have been repeatedly observed through microwave sensors on-board various satellites. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to estimate glacier velocity using microwave observations. Over the recent past, the trend in glacier velocity monitoring has shifted from interferometric tracking to intensity tracking. In this paper, we propose a method based on Stokes vector correlation of time lapse microwave observations. This method is proposed as an improvement over the conventional intensity correlation technique.

Variability in the growth, feeding and condition of barramundi (Lates calcarifer Bloch) in a northern Australian coastal river and impoundment	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lates calcarifer supports important fisheries throughout tropical Australia. Community-driven fish stocking has resulted in the creation of impoundment fisheries and supplemental stocking of selected wild riverine populations. Using predominantly tag-recapture methods, condition assessment and stomach flushing techniques, this study compared the growth of stocked and wild L. calcarifer in a tropical Australian river (Johnstone River) and stocked fish in a nearby impoundment (Lake Tinaroo). Growth of L. calcarifer in the Johnstone River appeared resource-limited, with juvenile fish in its lower freshwater reaches feeding mainly on small aytid shrimp and limited quantities of fish. Growth was probably greatest in estuarine and coastal areas than in the lower freshwater river. Fish in Lake Tinaroo, where prey availability was greater, grew faster than either wild or stocked fish in the lower freshwater areas of the Johnstone River. Growth of L. calcarifer was highly seasonal with marked declines in the cooler months. This was reflected in both stomach fullness and the percentage of fish with empty stomachs but the condition of L. calcarifer was similar across most sites. In areas where food resources appear stretched, adverse effects on resident L. calcarifer populations and their attendant prey species should be minimised through cessation of, or more conservative, stocking practices.

This study aims to use the Base System Modeling Program Environmental Hydrodynamics (Sisbahia) model to simulate seasonal hydrodynamic conditions in the lake and identify areas with the greatest silting. The model results revealed an identical distribution of the velocity module for each month of the year. However, at the outlet of the lake, a water channel variation speed of 0.28-0.32 m s(-1) was observed. Furthermore, at the inlet of the lake, vortex silting tended to occur, as verified by bathymetry. Sedimentation mainly occurred during periods of low rainfall, which is when Cosanpa increases the inflow of water to maintain the reservoir level and this leads to an increase in sediments in suspension. With the model, it was possible to identify locations with higher rates of sedimentation, and in the future, such data can serve as an effective tool for managing this water resource.

This chapter summarizes the spatial variation of organic matter and biomarkers from the watershed to the shelf. Monthly data collected from the downstream of the watershed help to elucidate the seasonal variation of biomarkers (e.g., pigments and amino acids) along with hydrological and biological processes. The geochemical characterization of biomarkers in the ECS is well studied, and this chapter provides an overview of the potential controls on biomarkers. Hydrological sorting, in situ primary production, and diagenetic processes contribute to the variable biomarker distribution, composition, and burial in the ECS. Anthropogenic disturbance is illustrated by an evaluation of the impact of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on the composition of terrigenous organic matter and pollutants in the study system. Climate change (e.g., extreme drought), impoundment by the TGD, and the effects of tributaries and lakes in the middle and lower streams of the river may play different roles in the delivery of organic carbon. Although there is high pressure from anthropogenic activities compared with other regions in the world, pollutant concentrations are relatively low and potential ecological risks are limited. With changing fluxes from rivers, and significant modification and burial of organic matter on the shelf due to global change, long-term observations are necessary to develop our knowledge of the biogeochemistry of organic matter in this highly dynamic shelf region.					; Zhu, Zhuoyi/HNS-4424-2023; Bao, Hongyan/HNQ-3406-2023	Bao, Hongyan/0000-0002-9632-1487; Zhu, Zhuo-Yi/0000-0002-0276-2418; 													2214-1553		978-3-319-16339-0; 978-3-319-16338-3				2015							119	135		10.1007/978-3-319-16339-0_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16339-0_6	10.1007/978-3-319-16339-0												WOS:000373990500008

However, habitat loss, overfishing, and the crayfish plague have diminished P. clarkii populations throughout their area of distribution. In consequence, this study systemically analyses the population structure and dynamics of P clarkii in the wetland of Poyang Lake using the analytical methods of Bhattacharya and Von Bertalanffy. The main purpose was to collect biological data necessary for the management of this species. The present study showed that the population structure consisted of a maximum of 5.58 age classes for females and 3.25 for males, which indicated that P. clarkii is a relatively short-lived species. The Y'/R analysis showed that E-present > E-0.5, which exceeded the optimization (E-opt) criterion of 0.5 for sustainable exploitation of fisheries, so this species was overexploited in Poyang Lake. The L-c (mean length at first capture) equals 67.5 mm. The estimated mesh size for catching the red swamp crayfish is 13.5 cm. The virtual population analysis model (VPA) showed that the largest annual catch of P clarkii is 3.43 x 10(4) t. The Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is 1.18 x 10(4) t. The low natural mortality rate range of 0.68-1.11 year(-1)uggested that it is ecologically worthwhile to allow the individuals of P clarkii to grow to larger sizes in order to contribute to the biomass for biologically optimal exploitation. This could be facilitated by the adoption of measures involving a closed season, which would help to conserve the fishery.

J	Bryan, RB; Brun, SE				Bryan, RB; Brun, SE			Laboratory experiments on sequential scour/deposition and their application to the development of banded vegetation	CATENA												Alternating bands of vegetation and bare soil, reported from many dryland regions, have been identified as indicators of rangeland deterioration triggered by overgrazing, cattle trampling or climatic change. Banded vegetation occurs at a range of scales and although it has been reported from a number of different environments, it is not characteristic of all degraded rangelands. It does appear particularly frequently on low angle, smooth slopes over soils of high erodibility but low permeability, where scant rainfall is sporadic or highly seasonal. It has been attributed both to wind and to water erosion, but few data on the processes active or their specific response to limiting environmental variables are available. Small-scale banded vegetation associated with small scour steps occurs on low angle alluvio-lacustrine flats surrounding Lake Baringo in semi-arid northern Kenya. In this area of strong moisture deficit, the dominant factor controlling the incidence of ground vegetation is variation in near-surface moisture storage. The regular spacing of the small-scale vegetation bands reflects preferential moisture storage in regularly-spaced sediment deposits. Field and laboratory runon and rainfall simulation experiments, previously reported, provided some data on the processes and conditions involved in formation of these deposits. This paper describes more closely-controlled laboratory rainfall simulation and runon experiments, carried out to identify the sequential scour and deposition processes involved, which are ultimately responsible for the regular variations in moisture storage capacity. These experiments, carried out in an 8.5 m long flume, show critical stream power (Omega) conditions in sheetwash and rain-impacted sheetflow required for sequential scour/deposition as 0.020-0.025 W m(-2) and between 0.043 and 0.055 W m(-2), respectively. Experimental results indicate that vegetation bands at the scale observed at Baringo are consistent with development by sequential scour and deposition, caused by some combination of sheetwash, rainsplash and rainflow. The vegetation bands are composed primarily of unpalatable low herbaceous plants, dominated by Trianthema triquetra. These plants colonize or survive better on deposition zones because of better soil moisture status. The vegetation bands can therefore indicate an initial stage in vegetation recovery rather than continuing rangeland deterioration, but at Baringo further development of vegetation appears to be restricted by high grazing intensities or by allelopathy.

Seasonal fluctuations in the primary production of the lake are principally controlled by the lake's thermal structure, which modulates the mixing of nutrient-rich deep water with that of the phytoplankton-rich near-surface layer. Satellites potentially offer an efficient, low cost method of providing information on the lakes thermal structure over the longer term via remote sensing observations of lake surface temperature. Here we investigate the accuracy of remotely sensed lake surface temperatures derived using data from the NOAA-11 AVHRR over a two-year period (1992-1993). Optimised triple window atmospheric correction algorithms are shown to provide an accuracy of around 0.5 degreesC when compared to in situ water temperatures. The effect of the 1994 switch in operational night-time satellite from NOAA-11 to NOAA-14 is assessed using modelling of the transfer of radiation through the Malawian atmosphere, combined with detail on the differences in the satellite spectral response functions. These simulations indicate that lake surface temperatures derived from NOAA-14 are warmer than those that would be derived from NOAA-11 under the same conditions. The magnitude of the temperature difference is estimated at 0.27 degrees+/-0.07 degreesC, depending on the viewing zenith angle. Finally, we illustrate the ability of the remotely derived surface temperature maps to provide information relevant to the lakes 3-D thermal structure. Evaluations of the annual mixing regime of the lake can be based on this information, this mixing being directly relevant to the seasonal variations in lake primary production.

Induced earthquakes have continued to occur for the past 34 years in the vicinity of this reservoir, and so far a total of 10 earthquakes of M greater than or equal to 5.0, over 100 of M greater than or equal to 4 and about 100,000 of M greater than or equal to 0.0 have occurred. Every year, following the rainy season, the water level in the reservoir rises and induced earthquakes occur. Seismic activity during 1967-68 was most intense when globally, the largest reservoir induced earthquake occurred on 10 December, 1967. Other years of intense seismic activity are 1973 and 1980. During 1986 another reservoir, Warna, some 20 km south of Koyna, began to be filled. The recent burst of seismic activity in Koyna-Warna region began in August, 1993, and was monitored with a close network of digital and analog seismographs. During August, 1993-December, 1995, 1,272 shocks of magnitude greater than or equal to 2 were located, including two earthquakes of M 5.0 and M 5.4 on 8 December, 1993 and 1 February, 1994, respectively. Two parallel epicentral trends in NNE-SSW direction, one passing through Koyna and the other through Warna reservoir are delineated. The 1993 increase in seismicity has followed a loading of 44.15 m in Warna reservoir during 11 June, 1993 through August 4, 1993, with a maximum rate of filling being 16 m/week. The larger shocks have been found to be preceded by a precursory nucleation process.

Increasing numbers of Cormorants use these lakes for feeding in the non-breeding season; the maximum number, usually reached in October or November, amounted to 1314 in 1991. The effect of Cormorant predation on fish stock was studied for two reasons: assessing possible damage to commercial fishery and assessing the role of the birds in a large-scale biological management programme that has been carried out in lake Woldenvijd during the period of study. As part of this programme, fish stock in this lake was reduced from 203 to 46 kg/ha. Most important prey species was Ruffe (60% of fish-mass in 1991/92), which has no value to either commercial fishermen or anglers. Perch, Pikeperch, Roach and Smelt were found in most samples as well, while Eel, the only species commercially caught in the lakes, was hardly found at all. Mean daily intakes ranged from 146 to 699 g with highest values in October and March. In 1989/90 total consumption in the two lakes was estimated at 3.7 kg/ha. In September 1991 - March 1992 however, after fish removal, 80% went to lake Wolderwijd, where smaller fish were taken. Nevertheless, total consumption amounted to 12.5 kg/ha, against 2.1 kg/ha in lake Veluwemeer. As most of the fish consumed belongs to species potentially hazardous to water quality (transparency) the Cormorants seem to support biological management. It is discussed whether the larger proportion of small, shoaling fish after removal of large fish could have enhanced possibilities for mass flock fishing, attracting the birds to lake Wolderwijd. On the other hand, achieving the long-term goals of biological management is likely to reduce the fishing possibilities for Cormorants.																			0373-2266						1995	83	1					167	184																WOS:A1995RM43100019

Seasonal diet and amphipod size selection of juvenile common bully, Gobiomorphus cotidianus, in a coastal New Zealand lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined the seasonal diet of juvenile (<= 32 mm total length) common bullies, Gobiomorphus cotidianus, in Lake Waihola, South Island, New Zealand and whether they preyed selectively on the amphipod, Paracalliope fluviatilis, which was a dominant prey item. Generally, >= 75% of all fish sampled had consumed amphipods, which comprised 80%, or more, of the total prey volumes in fish stomachs over most of a year except on one sampling occasion. Copepods, snails, chironomids, Daphnia, mysids and isopods also contributed to the diet. Comparisons of the size distribution of amphipods in fish stomachs and the lake on the date of sampling showed that on four occasions, juvenile bullies selectively consumed small amphipods. No selective feeding was detected on the other occasions. The dominance of primarily benthic amphipods in the diet of juvenile bullies which, in turn, are preyed on by piscivores, suggests a strong benthic-pelagic link in the transfer of energy in Lake Waihola.

A two-season investigation was undertaken to determine the contribution of benthic recruitment to the population development of several species of blue-green algae. 2. Gloeotrichia echinulata populations were shown to be heavily subsidized by benthic recruitment, deriving on average 40% of their planktonic colonies from the benthos. 3. Benthic recruitment of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; Anabaena flos-aquae and a second Anabaena species contributed less than 2% to planktonic increases, while Microcystis aeruginosa recruitment was negligible. 4. Phosphorus translocation via migrating G. echinulata accounted for most of the phosphorus (P) in the planktonic colonies, and constituted a significant portion of the internal loading of the lake. 5. Estimated P translocation via Aph. flos-aquae was relatively minor, although there was evidence of luxury uptake in the benthos.																			0046-5070					APR	1992	27	2					249	260		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00537.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00537.x													WOS:A1992HW34300008

Therefore, three ratios of essential resources (Si : N, Si : light, N : light) and one ratio of substitutable resources (nitrate: ammonium) were compared to changes in species composition to test the hypothesis that the seasonal change of phytoplankton species composition was a response to changing resource ratios. The relationship was analyzed by a rank correlation analysis between the relative contribution of individual species to total biomass and resource ratios. Allowance was made for time lags between changes in resource ratios and changes in relative biomass. Of 16 species, 14 showed a significant response to at least one resource ratio. Time lags ranged from 0 to 6 weeks. Most species seemed to be favored either by minimal or maximal ratios; optimal ratios in the middle of the range were rare.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	1993	38	4					838	845		10.4319/lo.1993.38.4.0838	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.4.0838													WOS:A1993LP66200009

We examined lake-level changes and peatland growth at Glimmerglass Lake and peatland in the Sylvania Wilderness Area to determine if the mid-Holocene increase in moisture indicated by the pollen record also influenced lakes and wetlands. Sphagnum peat began accumulating at the site at 6240 cal. yr BP. Diatom-inferred depth reconstructions show that the lake level rose 2 m and the peatland expanded out of its basin at 5300 cal. yr BP. All of these changes occurred as the last remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet disappeared and orbital forcing reduced seasonality relative to the early Holocene. We conclude that these continental-scale factors caused increased moisture availability in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, resulting in rising lakewater levels and peatland expansion.

J	Roseman, EF; Mills, EL; Forney, JL; Rudstam, LG				Roseman, EF; Mills, EL; Forney, JL; Rudstam, LG			Evaluation of competition between age-0 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) in Oneida Lake, New York	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Diet and growth of age-0 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and age-0 gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) were compared during June-August 1990 and 1991. In both years, Daphnia dominated the zooplankton community in June and early July but disappeared in mid-July and early August. Age-0 yellow perch consumed primarily Daphnia and copepods until the Daphnia stocks were depleted then switched to benthic prey. Small age-0 gizzard shad primarily selected Daphnia and copepods while larger individuals consumed fewer zooplankton and more phytoplankton. Data from 1984 through 1993 indicated no direct effect of interspecific competition on growth rates of either species. The decrease in Daphnia populations in years with abundant age-0 gizzard shad occurs later in the year than in years with abundant age-0 yellow perch, and we suggest that this timing is crucial for the outcome of fish interactions. When Daphnia decline later in the season, larger age-0 yellow perch can switch to benthic prey and larger age-0 gizzard shad to phytoplankton; thus, the outcome of these interactions differs from the depression of age-0 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) by competition from age-0 shad reported from many reservoirs.

Response of phytoplankton from the metalimnetic chlorophyll maximum to macro- and micro-nutrients amendments in Lake Geneva	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Despite re-oligotrophication and low trace elements concentrations, direct determination of limiting nutrient (s) of the phytoplankton community in Lake Geneva is still missing. Incubation experiments were carried out with either addition of phosphate (+P), nitrate (+N), reactive silica (+Si), iron (+Fe), nickel (+Ni) and molybdenum (+Mo) to surface water collected between 9 and 12 m, during seasonal fieldtrips in 2015. Macro- and micro-nutrients, dissolved concentrations, temperature and irradiance as well as chlorophyll a (Chl a) levels, Chl a:POC ratios, POP:POC ratios and Chl a variable fluorescence parameters were quantified. The rapid phosphorus consumption, elevated inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus ratios and increased Chl a, Chl a:POC and POP:POC, in response to P additions, all indicated a phosphorus limitation in phytoplankton. Moreover, none of the measured parameters differed significantly from the control in the other treatments. These results were also confirmed by the response of Chl a variable fluorescence. The effective photosystem II quantum yield in ambient light, the absolute electron transfer rate and the connectivity, under 53 mu mol photons/m(2)/s illumination, significantly increased while the non-photochemical quenching decreased in the +P treatment. Phytoplankton cells supplemented with phosphate were thus more efficient to capture photons and to drive them into photochemistry at light levels close to in situ levels. This is the first study to demonstrate directly a phosphorus limitation in Lake Geneva, pointing towards the success of its re-oligotrophication process.

J	Calder, JH; Gibling, MR; Eble, CF; Scott, AC; MacNeil, DJ				Calder, JH; Gibling, MR; Eble, CF; Scott, AC; MacNeil, DJ			The Westphalian D fossil lepidodendrid forest at Table Head, Sydney Basin, Nova Scotia: Sedimentology, paleoecology and floral response to changing edaphic conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												Strata of Westphalian D age on the western coast of the Sydney Basin expose a fossil forest of approximately 30 lepidodendrid trees within one of several elastic splits of the Harbour Seam. A mutidisciplinary approach was employed to interpret the origins of the coal bed, the depositional history of the site and the response of the fossil forest to changing edaphic conditions. The megaspore and miospore records indicate that the mire vegetation was dominated by arboreous lycopsids, especially Paralycopodites, with subdominant tree ferns. Petrographic, palynological and geochemical evidence suggest that the Harbour coal bed at Table Head originated as a rheotrophic (cf. planar) mire (eutric histosol). The mire forest is interpreted to have been engulfed by prograding distributary-channel sediments; sparse protist assemblages are suggestive of a freshwater delta-plain lake environment occasionally in contact with brackish waters. Lepidodendrids persisted as site colonizers of elastic substrates even after burial of the rheotrophic peatland and influenced the morphology of deposited sediment, but apparently were unable to colonize distributary channels. Equivocal taxonomic data (compression fossils) show the fossil forest to have been composed of both monocarpic (Lepidodendron) and polycarpic (Diaphorodendron, Paralycopodites, ?Sigillaria) lycopsids, genera recorded in the palynology of the uppermost ply of the underlying coal bed. Comparatively rare within the elastic beds of the fossil forest, however, is the stem compression of Paralycopodites, whose dispersed megapores and miospores dominate the underlying coal bed. Tree diameter data recorded equivalent to breast height indicate a forest of mixed age. These data would appear to suggest that some lepidodendrids employing a polycarpic reproductive strategy were better able to cross the ecological barrier imposed between peat and elastic substrates. Foliar compressions indicate that an understory or stand of Psaronius type tree ferns co-existed with the lepidodendrids on elastic substrates. which developed as incipient gleysol soils. The entombment of the forest can be ascribed to its distributary coastal setting, local subsidence and a seasonal climate that fostered wildfire and increased sedimentation.					; Scott, Andrew/C-6661-2008	Scott, Andrew/0000-0002-1998-3508; 													0166-5162					NOV	1996	31	1-4					277	313		10.1016/S0166-5162(96)00020-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0166-5162(96)00020-1													WOS:A1996VV65400013
J	VISSER, JNJ				VISSER, JNJ			POSTGLACIAL PERMIAN STRATIGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY OF SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL-AFRICA - BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS FOR CLIMATIC MODELING	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The post-glacial stratigraphy of southern and central Africa comprises mudrocks with subordinate sandstones and coal measures belonging to the Ecca Group overlain by fossiliferous mudstones and sandstones of the Beaufort Group (Madumabisa Mudstone of south-central Africa), preserved in the Karoo, Congo and extreme western margin of the Parana basins, the Kalahari-Zambezi and East Africa-Malagasy basin complexes, and the Nyasa basin and range complex. The palaeogeography of the region was controlled by the stable, elevated Kalahari and Congo cratons, a NE-trending weak zone between the cratons (site of the Kalahari-Zambezi-Malagasy basin complexes), a NNW-trending weak zone between the cratons and the Mozambique mobile belt (site of the Nyasa basin and range complex) and an E-W mobile belt along the southern margin of the continent (site of the foreland Karoo Basin). The postglacial Artinskian landscape which was inherited from the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation, consisted of a rugged interior plateau and shallow seas and seaways in the south and west. The Early-Late Permian landscape was still dominated by an uneven coastline in the south and freshwater lakes in the Congo Basin and along the Kalahari-Zambezi-Malagasy drainage systems. A marine incursion occurred in the Malagasy Basin. Relief on the interior plateau was steadily denuded. By Kazanian times large lakes covered the Karoo and Parana basins whereas along the coastal region all shallow seas were destroyed by an orogen. Freshwater lakes in the interior had reached their maximum extent. The Permo-Triassic landscape shows an increase in the interior relief due to renewed graben formation with lakes becoming smaller and more desiccated. The surface area of southwestern Gondwana covered by water reached a maximum of 34% during the Early-Late Permian and decreased to about 6% at the Permo-Triassic boundary. Climatic zones shifted southeastwards as southwestern Gondwana drifted into lower latitudes during the Permian. The ice margin started to retreat in central Africa during the Sakmarian, but the marine ice sheet in the Karoo Basin collapsed only in the Artinskian. Deglaciation was followed by a cool wet climate suitable for the formation of peatlands. In central and south-central Africa this climate was followed by temperate to warm, seasonal conditions which became progressively wetter with less seasonal fluctuation towards the east (Malagasy Basin) and drier towards the west. These conditions lasted until the end of the Kazanian. In the Karoo Basin the cool wet climate of the Artinskian became more temperate and also lasted until the end of the Kazanian when warm, semi-arid conditions expanded over the entire southern and central Africa. The geographic controlling factors for Permian climatic change were the interplay of latitudinal setting and continental evolution (formation of orographic barriers and loss of coastal seas).																			0031-0182					NOV	1995	118	3-4					213	243		10.1016/0031-0182(95)00008-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(95)00008-3													WOS:A1995TJ45200003

J	Kirchman, DL; Borch, NH				Kirchman, DL; Borch, NH			Fluxes of dissolved combined neutral sugars (polysaccharides) in the Delaware estuary	ESTUARIES												This project examined concentrations, composition and turnover neutral sugars in the Delaware estuary to gain insights into dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) use by heterotrophic bacteria and into the lability and diagenetic state of dissolved organic material (DOM) during passage through the estuary. Dissolved free monosaccharides were not measurable (< 5 nM) in the estuary whereas concentrations of dissolved combined neutral sugars (DCNS) were high, much higher than observed in oceanic waters. DCNS made up a similar fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as in the oceanic waters examined to date, and the monosaccharide composition of the DCNS pool was similar to that of oceanic waters. The composition did not vary substantially within the estuary or seasonally, but it did vary among three size fractions of the organic matter pool. Glucose was enriched in the low molecular weight fraction of DOC and in particulate material, whereas the high molecular weight DOC fraction was slightly depleted in glucose. Depletion experiments indicated that DCNS is not used extensively on the day time scale in the Delaware estuary, although freshly-produced polysaccharides may still be important carbon sources for heterotrophic bacteria. The very low concentrations of free monosaccharides in the Delaware estuary help to explain why DIN use by heterotrophic bacteria is relatively low in this estuary. Although DOC-DIN interactions in the Delaware apparently differ from oceanic waters, the portion of DOM traced by DCNS, which is thought to be the labile fraction, appears to be similar to that of oceanic DOM, suggesting that organic material in the estuary is degraded extensively before being exported to the coastal ocean.																			0160-8347					AUG	2003	26	4A					894	904		10.1007/BF02803348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803348													WOS:000185936000008
J	Beaver, JR; Havens, KE				Beaver, JR; Havens, KE			Seasonal and spatial variation in zooplankton community structure and their relation to possible controlling variables in Lake Okeechobee	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lake Okeechobee is a large (1732 km(2)), shallow (mean depth 2.7 m), eutrophic, subtropical lake located in southern Florida. Approximately 25% of the lake surface area is occupied by an extensive Littoral zone. From August 1988 to June 1992, approximate to 2000 zooplankton samples were collected throughout the lake. 2. During the study period, a severe drought lowered lake levels more than 1 m. At low and normal lake stage, the average lake-wide abundance of rotifers (c. 2000 l(-1)) was greater than during high water periods (c. 1600 l(-1)). The average abundance of adult crustaceans (cladocerans and copepods) (c. 30 l(-1)) varied little regardless of lake stage. 3. Although only minor differences were apparent when lake-wide means in rotifers and adult crustaceans for each lake stage were compared, pronounced differences were evident in the distribution of zooplankton communities within Lake Okeechobee. During high and normal lake stage, both rotifer and adult crustacean populations were more uniformly distributed throughout the lake. At low lake stage, the densest zooplankton populations were concentrated in the transition area between the central lake and the littoral fringe. The abundance of all zooplankton groups was inversely correlated with lake stage, but the relationship was much stronger for rotifers than crustaceans. Both rotifer and crustacean zooplankton population densities were positively related to increased phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a) but the relationship was much stronger for rotifers than crustaceans.																			0046-5070					AUG	1996	36	1					45	56		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00071.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00071.x													WOS:A1996VB54100006

Role of snow in the hydrology of a High Arctic riparian wetland	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH					16th Northern-Research-Basins International Symposium/Workshop (NRB)	AUG 27-SEP 02, 2007	Petrozavodsk, RUSSIA	No Res Basins, Reg Working Grp				Riparian wetlands are narrow strips of saturated and vegetated ground forming critical links between dry ground and waterways. The hydrology of a riparian wetland situated within a polar oasis landscape near Eastwind Lake, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut ( 808800N, 858350W) was investigated in 2006 using a combination of fieldwork and modelling. Supplemental information from 2005 was also employed. This study showed that deep snow in the nearby stream channel does not promote a period of extended over-bank flooding but instead initially serves as a dam blocking most streamwater from entering and flooding the wetland. It was not until the snow dam melts and disintegrates in response to favourable weather conditions that the wetland becomes flooded and fully recharged. This was a delay of three weeks from the previous year. For the remainder of the 2006 growing season, contributions of meltwater from late-lying snow beds located within and adjacent to the stream channel and near the headwaters were essential for maintaining saturated conditions in the wetland.																			1998-9563	2224-7955				SEP	2008	39	4					277	286		10.2166/nh.2008.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2008.004													WOS:000258483300005
J	GAEDKE, U				GAEDKE, U			ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS BASED ON BIOMASS SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS - A CASE-STUDY OF A PLANKTON COMMUNITY IN A LARGE LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The plankton biomass size distribution and its seasonal changes were used to estimate seasonal fluctuations of the metabolic activity of the community and of the efficiency to transfer biomass to larger sized organisms in a large and deep prealpine lake (Bodensee: Lake Constance). The efficiency of transfer of biomass from small (e.g. autotrophic) to larger (e.g. herbivorous) organisms increased considerably during the first half of the year and reached maximum values when daphnid densities were high. This trend was attributed to the different generation times of the organisms involved in the food web. The trophic transfer efficiency may depend on the predator-prey weight ratios, and the efficiency of growth and exploitation of the constituent organisms. The contribution of these factors to the overall change of the transfer efficiency was estimated from additional information on the food-web structure. The results derived from the size spectra agreed reasonably well with previous studies of single populations, suggesting that biomass size distributions may substantially contribute to ecosystem analysis. The seasonal trend in slopes of the size spectrum was related to predictions derived from conceptual models. Empirical results from Lake Constance could be reconciled with those models accounting for seasonal changes of exploitation efficiency. Inference from the size spectra supported the hypothesis that natural assemblages of pelagic bacteria are unlikely to attain the potential productivity implied by allometric relationships.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1993	38	1					112	127		10.4319/lo.1993.38.1.0112	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.1.0112													WOS:A1993LA00800009

In ZLP 1367 boxes were controlled; in GWLP 545 in 1993 and 776 in 1994. In ZLP. Myotis daubentonii dominated (57.1%) and used boxes as breeding sites. In GWLP, M. daubentonii was not recorded in boxes. Pipistrellus nathusii and Myotis nattereri in ZLP and M. nattereri in GWLP rarely used boxes as breeding sites. Solitary males of Pipistrellus nathusii were widespread in boxes in both Parks. Nyctalus nactula, Myotis dasycneme. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Plecotus auritus were sporadically found in boxes. Relative densities of bats (number of individuals / 100 boxes) in UP were 4 times higher than in GWLP. Species richness (number of species) and diversity (Simpson index) were also higher in ZLP. Breeding colonies of bats tended to prefer the sawdust-concrete boxes over the wooden boxes. Our data suggests that a dense network of lakes and rivers, as well as the presence of concrete boxes may positively influence the relative density and species diversity of bats roosting in boxes in pine plantations.

The device comprises a hollow cylinder with a DGT assembly at its base and acts as a traditional sediment trap, except that any remobilization from settling particles is reflected in the mass of metal taken up from solution by the DGT assembly, a control-DGT device (an upside-down trap) was used to measure the metal taken up by the assembly in the absence of remobilization from particles. Deployments of the control device under laboratory conditions and below the well-mixed surface layer of a lake showed that the cylindrical trap design, with a height:diameter ratio of 5 : 1, resulted in negligible turbulence near the base of the trap so that uptake by the control was governed by molecular diffusion. The DGT-trap and -control devices were deployed together within and immediately below the main oxycline of a seasonally anoxic lake in 1996 and 1997. The reproducibility of the metal uptakes measured by the devices in the field wets typically better than +/-10% for the controls and +/-20% for the traps. The uptakes of Mn, Co, Al, Ba, and Ni, but not Fe and Cu, were significantly and consistently higher in the trap devices than in the controls. Reductive dissolution of Mn oxide appeared to be the source of the four remobilized trace metals, whereas Fe oxides made no significant contribution. The remobilization of Mn, Co, Al, Ba, and Ni was also reflected in elevated dissolved concentrations in the vicinity of the oxycline. Comparisons of the metal : Mn ratios obtained from the DGT-trap data with those calculated from the water-column concentrations indicated that the elevated concentrations of dissolved Co were derived solely from Mn oxide dissolution, whereas Ba, Al, and Ni also appear to be affected by other processes.

Plant material was the second most heavily consumed food and varied in its dietary contribution between fish and two study fields. The animal component of the diet was negligible in volume. The diet of fish from one rice field (site 1 ) changed from plants to DA over the season, while DA was the most consumed food in the other study field (site 2) throughout the season. Chlorophytes were the dominant algal group in rice fields. The low abundance of cyanophytes may have led to the dietary reliance on DA and plants. Although C carpio showed an overwhelming reliance on detrital aggregate throughout the season, there was a distinct but small dietary prey component which consisted mainly of chironomids and corixids. Seeds of grassy weeds (Gramineae) were also common in the diet. Fish from site 1 consumed cyclopoids, the cladoceran Chydorus, and the conchostracan Cyclesteria hislopi in the first half of the season, while corixids, chironomids, C hislopi, and seeds constituted a greater proportion of the diet in the latter part. In site 2, C carpio fed mostly on chironomids and corixids, throughout the season. The relatively low abundance of chironomids and microcrustaceans in the fields seems to have contributed to detrital aggregate being overwhelmingly the food of C carpio. C carpio foreguts were less full during the season compared with O. niloticus. Both fish species exhibited similar patterns of growth in both study fields. The condition factor of C carpio was similar in both rice fields. O. niloticus from both fields had very similar condition factors although the seasonal pattern of values varied somewhat.																			0044-8486					JUN 30	1994	123	3-4					281	307		10.1016/0044-8486(94)90066-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(94)90066-3													WOS:A1994PA41200011

Because of its influence on metal bioavailability, AVS has been proposed as a key normalization phase for the development of sediment quality criteria for metals. However, studies conducted primarily in marine and estuarine systems have shown that AVS concentrations can vary markedly both temporally and with (sediment) depth. In this study, AVS concentrations were measured monthly for 16 mo in several segments of sediment cores from three freshwater lakes: Caribou Lake, Fish Lake and Pike Lake in northeastern Minnesota, USA. The concentrations of AVS in cores from the three lakes varied inversely with sediment depth. AVS concentrations also varied seasonally by as much as two orders of magnitude and were directly correlated with changes in water temperature. The correlation between AVS and temperature likely was related both to changes in primary productivity and sediment microbial activity.					; Hoke, Robert/R-4155-2019	Hoke, Robert/0000-0002-3120-2882; 													0018-8158					NOV 12	1993	271	2					87	95		10.1007/BF00007545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007545													WOS:A1993MV39200004

Rb-Cs ratio as an indicator of fish diet in Lakes of the Patagonia, Argentina	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH												The ratios of Rb to Cs contents were studied in five fish species from seven lakes located in the Patagonia Andean Range, Argentina in order to trace fish diet. The species studied were native velvet catfish (Diplomistes viednzensis) and creole perch (Percichthys trucha), and exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and brook trout (Salvenilus fontinalis). Rainbow trout specimens from two farms were also studied, as well as fish food items and native mussels (Diplodon chilensis). Rb and Cs concentrations were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis. A positive correlation of Cs concentration in the muscle of velvet catfish with fish length was observed, probably associated with the long biological half-life of this element in this species, whereas the Rb concentration remained constant, hence inhibiting the use of Rb-Cs ratios as a tracer in this case. Seasonal variations observed for rainbow trout and Cs concentration background bias in one of the lakes studied are also a limiting factor to the use of Rb-Cs ratios as a diet tracer. Rb-Cs ratios allowed clear differentiation of rainbow trout raised in farms from the natural specimens that lived in the same environment, in agreement with Rb-Cs ratios determined in both diets. Rb-Cs ratios in rainbow trout showed significant differences between Rivadavia and Futalaufquen lakes compared to Moreno and Nahuel Huapi lakes, which could be associated with a higher participation of plankton in the diet in the first case. No relevant variations in Rb-Cs ratios of brown trout were observed, probably because of the similarity in the diet.

To assess the morphological constraints on intracohort cannibalism in largemouth bass, we evaluated the relationship of mouth width, body depth, and total length in age-0 fish. Morphological measurements predicted a threshold predator-prey relationship of: prey length = 0.309 . predator length(1.109), whereas experimental results suggested the relationship of: prey length = 0.5 . predator length. Our results indicated that intracohort cannibalism may begin as early as 9 d after swim-up in southern lakes and reservoirs and 12 d in northern lakes. However, because of the length of the spawning season, slower growth, and male guarding, intracohort cannibalism may be more important in southern systems than in northern lakes.

The characterization of the limnological variables and of the fish fauna of a open lake and of the main channel in the Rio das Mortes floodplain was conducted in order to compare these environments and indicate the influencing environmental factors of the fish communities in each one of them. A significative difference was observed between the open lake and the river channel in relation to the water transparency, higher in the open lake, and water velocity, higher in the river channel. Species diversity was also different between the sites, with significantly higher value in the open lake. In both envitonments the highest richness and diversity values were obtained during the low water period, and the relative density (CPUE) values in the rising water period. The environments were more similar during the wet season, in relation to both fish abundance and limnological characteristics. This happens due to the homogeneization of the water and habitat structure caused by flooding. The results indicate that the flood pulse, associated with water velocity, was the major driving force for the fish fauna structure in the environments sampled in this study.

It was hypothesized that a seasonal or body-size related increase in wet energy density of sea lamprey tissue contributed to a tendency for model predictions to overestimate growth in wet mass by large sea lampreys late in the year. Bomb calorimetry of parasitic-phase sea lampreys collected in northern Lake Huron during 1996 and 1997 revealed that wet energy density increased with wet body mass. Seasonal effects were not significant once the effects of body mass were taken into account. Increased wet energy density resulted both from a decrease in percentage water content and an increase in energy density of dry tissue with increased body mass. Statistical comparisons failed to reveal significant differences between sexes or years. Although the overall mean wet energy density for sea lampreys sampled in the present study was similar to the empirically-derived constant value used in previous models, incorporating a relationship between wet energy density and wet body mass into our sea lamprey feeding model improved its ability to predict instantaneous growth.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			297	306		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70495-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70495-X													WOS:000221321300022

Several shallow interdunal lakes in southwest Spain are in close hydraulic connection with the shallow ground water. Two permanent lakes and one intermittent lake have chloride concentrations that differ by almost an order of magnitude. A two-dimensional solute-transport model, modified to simulate transient groundwater-lake interaction, suggests that the rising water table during the wet season leads to local flow reversals toward the lakes. Response of the individual lakes, however, varies depending on the lake's position in the regional flow system. The most dilute lake is a flow-through lake during the entire year; the through flow is driven by regional groundwater flow. The other permanent lake, which has a higher solute concentration, undergoes seasonal groundwater flow reversals at its downgradient end, resulting in complex seepage patterns and higher solute concentrations in the ground water near the lake. The solute concentration of the intermittent lake is influenced more strongly by the seasonal wetting and drying cycle than by the regional flow system. Although evaporation is the major process affecting the concentration of conservative solutes in the lakes, geochemical and biochemical reactions influence the concentration of nonconservative solutes. Probable reactions in the lakes include biological uptake of solutes and calcite precipitation; probable reactions as lake water seeps into the aquifer are sulfate reduction and calcite dissolution. Seepage reversals can result in water composition that appears inconsistent with predictions based on head measurements because, under transient flow conditions, the flow direction at any instant may not satisfactorily depict the source of the water. Understanding the dynamic nature of groundwater-lake interaction aids in the interpretation of hydrologic and chemical relations between the lakes and the ground water.																			0022-1694					AUG	1992	136	1-4					123	154		10.1016/0022-1694(92)90008-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(92)90008-J													WOS:A1992JJ21700007

The histology and ultrastructure of different levels of infection in intestinal connective tissues and wall tissues is described. A total of 391 S. melanotheron melanotheron and 222 T zillii were examined from October 1987 to October 1989. M. heterospora was found throughout the study period, with a total prevalence of 42.19 and 26.57% for S, melanotheron melanotheron and T zillii respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in occurrence as a function of season in S. melanotheron melanotheron but not in T zillii, and there was a significant difference for size and sex in the former and for sex in the latter. M. heterospora induces total destruction of the intestine structure and probably leads to osmoregulatory disturbance.

For females, levels of persistent pollutants decreased linearly with age, weight, or length. This decline was ascribed to the seasonal elimination of the lipophilic pollutants in roe, which contained up to 10 times higher fat levels compared to muscle and over 10 times the amounts of pollutants. Male pike contained higher levels of pollutants than females, probably due to the lower elimination via gonadal products, as germinal tissue constitutes only 2% of the male total body weight and has a lower fat content than ovaries. Female germinal tissue can account for as much as 15% of the body weight. No major fat deposits other than those in germinal tissue were found in pike, which also had a low muscle fat content, suggesting that the importance of roe elimination in removing pollutants may be greater in pike than in salmonids. Uptake of persistent pollutants can vary greatly within a species, owing to differences in sex, age, and so forth, as well as between species, owing to differences in fat deposition strategies.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				MAY	1993	12	5					855	861		10.1002/etc.5620120509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620120509													WOS:A1993KX60700009

From February 1999 until January 2000 sets of four replicate sediment cores were collected from a total of six sampling sites on a seasonal scale. Nematodes dominated the meiofaunal community at all sites. The combined effect of wind speed and river discharge correlated strongly with the meiofaunal abundance at the four sites closest to the river mouth. In contrast, meiofauna of sites further from the river mouth were dominated by temperature, lake level variation, and nutrient-related factors. Of the meiofauna taxa observed, the presence of nematodes and oligochaetes was closely related to the interaction between wind and river. Nematodes and oligochaetes within the river-influenced littoral area seemed to be adapted to frequent changes in their habitats. However, the study also showed the complexity of littoral areas in proximity to rivers, owing to the strong interaction between the river and wind on a seasonal scale.

Establishing reliable estimates of consumption is necessary for understanding the physiology, bioenergetics and trophic relationships of organisms. For fish, the inability to measure consumption directly prevents a mechanistic understanding of habitat-foraging relationships. Building upon established models for (137)caesium (Cs) mass balance in fish, we used natural abundances of a stable geologically derived isotope of Cs to estimate consumption rates over the first growing season for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and to derive a general model that provides integrative estimates of consumption rates for individuals of all sizes. 2. To test the reliability of the trace metal approach we (i) performed a sensitivity analysis of model parameters and (ii) parameterized the model with site-specific data, including gut contents, Cs concentrations of invertebrate prey and assimilation rates. 3. We applied the method in two sites to make the first in situ determinations of consumption rates of individual age-0 salmon at post-larval and fry stages, for fish as small as 0.1 g. Consumption estimates were most responsive to changes in three parameters: Cs body burdens, Cs concentration in prey items and assimilation efficiency, all of which could be measured with high precision using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. 4. The assimilation efficiency of Cs measured on field-caught age-0 salmon was approximately 60%. Consumption rates at 2 weeks post-stocking were highly variable in both sites, ranging from no detectable consumption to 8.5% fresh weight (fw) day(-1). By the end of the growing season, consumption rates were less variable (2-4% fw day(-1)). 5. Synthesis and applications. This study is the first to demonstrate that background levels of geologically derived Cs can be used to estimate consumption rates of fish. Our results show that extremely low consumption rates during the first 6 weeks of life correspond closely with the critical survival period in other fish populations, and suggest a mechanism for a hypothesized survival bottleneck at this time. The results implicate the importance of early season habitat availability when considering management priorities of fish. Additionally, our use of stable Cs at natural abundance concentrations permits the global application of this trace element approach for estimating consumption rates of fish as well as other organisms. This general approach can be adopted for conservation and management settings in which it is necessary to identify suitable foraging habitat of a species or to quantify the relationship between consumption and growth.																			0021-8901					OCT	2004	41	5					1009	1020		10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00956.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00956.x													WOS:000224167700020

In this paper, the dual isotopes delta N-15 and delta O-18 and dissolved anions in regularly collected samples (n = 10) from the studied river, which is one of the most seriously polluted rivers in the plain river network regions of the Taihu Lake catchment, were analyzed to ascertain the main nitrate (NO3-)sources and watershed N processing in the context of monsoon climate. The seasonal variations in precipitation, temperature, and hydrology play key roles in the regulation of the river NO3-concentration, NO3-sources, and watershed N processing. Nitrification of N-containing materials in the soil was possibly the major source of NO3-all year round, especially in the rainy season, whereas manure and sewage significantly contributed to the NO3-load in the Taige River in the dry season. Nitrification and denitrification processes within the area were closely related. The significant negative relationship between the water temperature and delta O-18-NO3-values indicated the occurrence of nitrification in the soil throughout the year. By contrast, seasonal variations of denitrification were apparent from May to July with the high soil temperature and moisture, thereby indicating the occurrence of denitrification (22.9%) within the watershed. After the assessment of temporal variations of NO3-sources and watershed N processing, improved environmental management practices can be implemented to protect water resources and prevent further water quality deterioration in human-impacted watersheds.

Detailed field investigations, thorough petrographic and nanoscopic examinations and geochemical analysis revealed that they were originally precipitated as carbonate microbialite in isolated freshwater ponds scattered within a fluvial floodplain. These lacustrine microbialites were subjected to intermittent drying and wetting conditions and eventually altered to pseudobrecciated nodular palustrine limestone through several pedogenic and early diagenetic processes. The pedogenesis is exhibited by cracking, nodulization, mottling, pseudomicrokarst and root traces. The desiccation macrocracks are filled with siliciclastic sands derived from short-lived flash floods. Diagenesis is represented by aggradational neomorphism of micrite, cementation of cracks and voids by sparry calcite and precipitation of biogenic needle-fibre calcite. Concurrently, the cracks filled with siliciclastic sands have been calcretized, forming an embedded interapalustrine calcrete. Mottling postdates the early diagenesis and is manifested by pseudoclotted texture and abundant black spots and dendrites, which may have been developed by the marmorization of iron and manganese ions due to the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater. The C-13 and O-18 values are mostly comparable with those of closed freshwater lakes; however, the high negative values of O-18 may be attributed to diagenetic calcite. The occurrence of this palustrine limestone within a fluvial siliciclastic sequence that lacks clearly developed calcrete profiles may present an exceptional setting for palustrine limestone.

The relationship between tissue mirex concentration and body mass was used to separate eels into two groups: the proportion of eels migrating from contaminated areas (Lake Ontario and upper St. Lawrence River) increased as the migration season progressed. Vertebral malformations and basophilic foci in the liver (preneoplastic lesions) were more frequent at the end of the migratory season, when the eels were more heavily contaminated with organochlorine compounds. in contrast, mesenteric nematodes were more common in the first week of the season, when eels were less contaminated. Diameters and percentages of different stages of oocytes, and density and surface area of pigmented macrophage aggregates in the spleen, did not vary among weeks. While basophilic aci are specific biomarkers of exposure to environmental contaminants, vertebral malformations may be caused by a variety of other anthropogenic or natural factors. Further studies are needed to confirm the observed associations between chemical contamination and pathological changes.

These assemblages were located in areas spanning active upwelling centres on the shelf and zones of lower productivity on the lower slope. The slopes of the curves for the normalized size distributions were related to zonal productivity and abundance of the smallest size classes. In the main upwelling centre, in which abundance of small specimens was higher and community diversity lower, biomass clearly dropped off with increasing size; teleost fishes and mid-level predators (which prey on euphausiids and other pelagic crustaceans) predominated. In the less productive zone, where the biomass of small specimens was very low and community diversity very high, biomass increased or at least tended to remain constant with size and elasmobranchs and apex predators (which prey on fish and cephalopods) were most abundant.

J	Smith, JP				Smith, JP			Nesting season food habits of 4 species of herons and egrets at Lake Okeechobee, Florida	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												Based on the composition of nestling regurgitations collected during 3 breeding seasons, fish were the most important prey group for Great Egrets (Ardea alba: N = 200 nest-day samples; aggregate percent biomass [APE] = 73.4%), Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula: N = 115; APE = 91.4%), and Tricolored Herons (E. tricolor: N = 68; APE = 97.3%). For Little Blue Herons (E. caerulea: N = 57), grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus; APE = 39.7%) ranked higher in overall importance than all fishes combined (APE = 36.5%). Dietary overlap, as measured by Schoener's Similarity Index, was greatest between Snowy Egrets and Tricolored Herons (77%) and lowest between Tricolored Herons and Little Blue Herons (30%). Diet diversity as measured by Shannon's Index, was highest for Great Egrets (2.04), intermediate for Snowy Egrets (1.71) and Tricolored Herons (1.68), and lowest for Little Blue Herons (1.60). Great Egrets ate a wider variety of fish species and sizes, especially larger fishes, and more crayfish than the other species. Little Blue Herons ate fewer fish and more grass shrimp and insects, and ate smaller forage fishes than Tricolored Herons but similar-sized fish as Snowy Egrets. The coarse-scale trophic composition of Snowy Egret and Tricolored Heron diets did not differ significantly, but Tricolored Herons ate larger forage fishes than Snowy Egrets. Pronounced interannual and intercolony variation in diet composition suggested that Great Egrets and Little Blue Herons switched prey types as hydrologic conditions and habitat availability changed. Conversely, lack of such variation suggested that Snowy Egrets and Tricolored Herons adjusted their foraging tactics to ensure continued encounters with preferred prey despite changing habitat conditions. These results are generally consistent with other published data, help confirm some generalizations about foraging strategies and patterns of niche differentiation among these ecologically similar species, and have implications for managing the Lake Okeechobee ecosystem.																			0738-6028						1997	20	2					198	220		10.2307/1521686	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521686													WOS:A1997XR83700004
J	SOTOMAYOR, D; CORREDOR, JE; MORELL, JM				SOTOMAYOR, D; CORREDOR, JE; MORELL, JM			METHANE FLUX FROM MANGROVE SEDIMENTS ALONG THE SOUTHWESTERN COAST OF PUERTO-RICO	ESTUARIES												Although the sediments of coastal marine mangrove forests have been considered a minor source of atmospheric methane, these estimates have been based on sparse data from similar areas. We have gathered evidence that shows that external nutrient and freshwater loading in mangrove sediments may have a significant effect on methane flux. Experiments were performed to examine methane fluxes from anaerobic sediments in a mangrove forest subjected to secondary sewage effluents on the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico. Emission rates were measured in situ using a static chamber technique, and subsequent laboratory analysis of samples was by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector. Results indicate that methane flux rates were lowest at the landward fringe nearest to the effluent discharge, higher in the seaward fringe occupied by red mangroves, and highest in the transition zone between black and red mangrove communities, with average values of 4 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, 42 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, and 82 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, respectively. Overall mean values show these sediments may emit as much as 40 times more methane than unimpacted pristine areas. Pneumatophores of Aviciennia germinans have been found to serve as conduits to the atmosphere for this gas. Fluctuating water level overlying the mangrove sediment is an important environmental factor controlling seasonal and interannual CH4 flux variations. Environmental controls such as freshwater inputs and increased nutrient loading influence in situ methane emissions from these environments.

J	Laird, LD; Campbell, ID				Laird, LD; Campbell, ID			High resolution palaeofire signals from Christina Lake, Alberta: a comparison of the charcoal signals extracted by two different methods	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					Meeting on Fire and the Palaeoenvironment	APR, 1997	UNIV SHEFFIELD, SHEFFIELD, ENGLAND	Univ Sheffield Archaeol Soc	UNIV SHEFFIELD			Two high resolution palaeofire signals were extracted from the annually-laminated sediment of Christina Lake in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. A charcoal curve focusing on large charcoal fragments (> 125 mum) was extracted by the sieving method described by Whitlock and Millspaugh. A carbon curve which includes all size fractions of charcoal was extracted by a method modified from Winkler's chemical assay method. Modifications included increasing the duration of nitric acid treatment to 2 h and using a total carbon analyser (TCA) rather than standard loss on ignition. These adjustments resulted in a carbon curve which is unaffected by clay water losses and subtle changes in sedimentology which were problematic in the original gravimetric technique. The sensitivity of the TCA allowed subtle shifts in carbon (i.e. charcoal) abundance to be detected in lake sediments with low levels of charcoal. When compared with the known fire history near the lake since 1900, the sieved charcoal curve was most responsive to fires known to burn near the shore of the lake and less responsive to fires burning elsewhere in the watershed. The TCA carbon curve was somewhat more sensitive than the sieved charcoal curve for detecting fires in the drainage basin which did not burn to the lake edge. The TCA carbon curve was strongly correlated with sediment influx, suggesting stream inputs of charcoal are the dominant influence on this signal. The peak in response of the TCA curve to known fire events was sometimes lagged by several years, suggesting that it can take several seasons for the bulk of stream-transported charcoal to make its way from the watershed to its final deposition site in the lake. Very large fires burning just outside the drainage basin of the lake were not detected by either method, suggesting that both of the methods used are sensitive only to fires burning in the watershed and that long-distance aerially dispersed charcoal is insignificant at this site.

Wine flavours of Walla Walla Valley varierals (including Caberner Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, and Syrah) appear to be influenced by low humidity, long growing season (1500-1800 degreesC degree days), soil type and drainage, drip irrigation, pruning to restrict vine vigour, trellising methods, and overall topographic climatic setting of the vineyards. Microclimates within the Walla Walla Valley appellation, combined with variations in soil and bedrock stratigraphy, yield a range of wine styles as great as many larger regions and some countries.																			0315-0941	1911-4850				DEC	2000	27	4					149	171																WOS:000166903800001

Low Concentrations of Contaminants in an Invasive Cyprinid, the Rudd, in a Great Lakes Area of Concern	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The invasive, omnivorous rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus is abundant in the upper Niagara River, a Great Lakes Area of Concern. Invasive species can alter trophic and contaminant pathways, but complex ontogenetic and seasonal diet shifts by rudds make it difficult to predict their chemical burdens relative to other fishes. We quantified concentrations of chemical residues in rudds and compared them to six fish species from various trophic levels. Rudds contained low concentrations of total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (mean = 0.02 mu g/g), Hg (mean = 0.03 mu g/g), and polychlorinated biphenyls (mean = 0.06 mu g/g); these concentrations were among the lowest for all species examined. Concentrations of aldrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, total hexachlorocyclohexanes, mirex, and total chlordanes were less than the method detection limit for all rudds examined. If reducing rudd biomass is determined to be beneficial, resource managers could consider targeted harvest, given the low concentrations of contaminant in rudds and their susceptibility to capture.					; Richter, Wayne/AGG-7273-2022	Paterson, Gordon/0000-0001-8453-4197; Richter, Wayne/0000-0001-5300-7757													0007-4861	1432-0800				NOV	2014	93	5					567	573		10.1007/s00128-014-1325-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1325-3								24972839					WOS:000343043000011
J	Rawn, DFK; Muir, DCG				Rawn, DFK; Muir, DCG			Sources of chlorpyrifos and dacthal to a small Canadian prairie watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Atmospheric deposition acid air-water exchange of two semivolatile pesticides, Dacthal and chlorpyrifos, were compared in a small agricultural watershed in southern Manitoba, Canada, between 1994 and 1996. Dacthal was not used in the watershed nor in the surrounding region. Dacthal concentrations were derived from long-range transport and deposition processes and were lower than those of chlorpyrifos, which was applied locally each year of the study. Maximum concentrations of chlorpyrifos in air (103 ng/m(3)), precipitation (38 ng/L), and creek water (105 ng/L) were observed during local application periods. The highest Dacthal concentrations (4 ng/L) observed in precipitation occurred during intervals when its use in the U.S, was expected, although a seasonal relationship was not established. Precipitation and gas exchange across the air-water boundary were important pathways of movement for both chlorpyrifos and Dacthal. A net volatilization flux from the entire creek surface was observed for chlorpyrifos (1.4 g, 24000 ng/m(2)) in 1995 and for Dacthal in both 1995 (0.37 g, 6300 ng/m(2)) and 1996 (0.15 g, 2600 ng/m2).					; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 1	1999	33	19					3317	3323		10.1021/es990290n	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es990290n													WOS:000082881100024
J	Gomersall, CE; Hinkel, KM				Gomersall, CE; Hinkel, KM			Estimating the variability of active-layer thaw depth in two physiographic regions of northern Alaska	GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS												The active layer is the zone above permafrost that experiences seasonal freeze and thaw. Active-layer thickness varies annually In response to air and surface temperature, and generally decreases poleward. Substantially less is known about thaw variability across small lateral distances in response to topography, parent material, vegetation, and subsurface hydrology. A graduated steel rod was used to measure the 1998 end-of-season thaw depth across several transects. A balanced hierarchical sampling design was used to estimate the contribution to total variance in active-layer depth at separating distances of 1, 3, 9, 27, and 100 meters. A second sampling scheme was used to examine variation at shorter distances of 0.3 and 0.1 meter. This seven-stage sample design l;ns applied to two sites in the Arctic Foothills physiographic province, and four sites on the Arctic Coastal Plain province In northern Alaska. The spatial variability for each site was determined using, ANOVA and variogram methods to compare intersite anti inter-province variation. Spatial variation in thaw depth was different in the Foothills and Coastal Plain sites. A greater percentage of the total variance occurs at short lag distances (0-3 meters) at the Foothills sites, presumably reflecting tile influence of frost boils and tussock vegetation on ground heat flow. In contrast, thaw variation at the Coastal Plain sites occurs at distances exceeding 10 meters, and is attributed to tile influence of well developed networks of ice-wedge polygons and the presence of drained thaw-lake basins. This information was used to determine fin ongoing sampling scheme for each site and to assess the suitability of each method of analysis.																			0016-7363	1538-4632				APR	2001	33	2					141	155		10.1111/j.1538-4632.2001.tb00441.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1538-4632.2001.tb00441.x													WOS:000167819300003

This area is subject to chronic natural oil seepage and spillage from oil production activities. Multivariate analysis was used to define those environmental variables which best explained community composition. The deeper sites were impoverished due to the development of anoxia below a pycnocline which formed during the wet season. Abundance/biomass comparison (ABC) plots indicated that macrobenthic communities near an oil refinery were grossly to moderately stressed while those close to the Trinidad Pitch Lake, one of the largest natural oil seeps in the world, were not. Taxonomic aggregation of the species data to family level resulted in little loss of information in the multivariate analyses and apparently improved the ability of ABC curves to discriminate pollution. Comparisons of the severity of community degradation at these sites using a phylum-level meta-analysis of 'production' were compatible with NE Atlantic data, which augurs well for the more global applicability of this approach. A feature of the Trinidad samples is that they all separate along the upper edge of the meta-analysis 'wedge', due mainly to their higher average proportion of Crustaced relative to Echinodermata and Mollusca. This is explained in terms of the estuarine character of the region, and suggests that the unexplained vertical axis in Warwick & Clarke's (companion article) ordination may be related to natural environmental characteristics.																			0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB	1993	92	3					233	243		10.3354/meps092233	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps092233													WOS:A1993KR39200003

Upper Permian paleosols of the East European Platform: Diagnostics of pedogenesis and paleogeographic reconstruction	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												A vertical sequence of seven buried paleosols composing the Klimovsk pedocomplex was studied in the basin of the Sukhona River (Vologda oblast). These paleosols were formed according to the accumulative model of pedogenesis (pedosedimentation model). They had monogenetic profiles with eluvial-gley, structural, and carbonate-illuvial types of differentiation. The set of elementary pedogenic processes responsible for the development of these soils included gleyzation in the surface horizon and around the roots, the inter- and intrahorizon translocation and segregation of iron, structuring, humification, weathering, lessivage, the migration and segregation of carbonates, and the synthesis of palygorskite and analcime. The studied paleosol profiles make it possible to reconstruct seven pedogenetic stages; each of them lasted for about n x 10(2)-10(3) years. The paleosols were formed on a flat lacustrine-alluvial plain with drying lakes and temporary streams. The stages of inundation and water stagnation on the surface alternated with the stages of drying of the territory. The climate was warm, with well-pronounced wet and dry seasons. Against this general climatic background, arid climatic epochs marked by the development of calcic paleosols alternated with humid climatic epochs marked by the development of noncalcareous paleosols.																			1064-2293					FEB	2010	43	2					127	140		10.1134/S106422931002002X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S106422931002002X													WOS:000274706300002

The reproductive biology of a Central American cichlid Neetroplus nematopus in Lake Xiloa, Nicaragua	CURRENT ZOOLOGY					Conference on Ecological and Evolutionary Ethology of Fishes	JUN 29-JUL 03, 2008	Boston Univ, Boston, MA		Boston Univ			This study was conducted to provide a five-year database on the breeding seasonality and breeding biology of a Central American cichlid fish Neetroplus nematopus, a biparental substratum spawning cichlid that cares for its eggs, wrigglers, and fry for up to six weeks. A total of 503 breeding pairs were monitored for breeding success. Breeding pairs of N. nematopus are sexually dimorphic in size, with females averaging 39% of male body mass. Fry emerged from 85% of nesting cavities. After three weeks, only 30% of the broods were present in the nesting cavity; these broods had a 30% survival rate, giving a 9% overall survival rate. Nineteen percent of the successful parents with three week old broods adopted foreign fry. A consistent unimodal breeding peak in December was observed for five years. This breeding peak differed dramatically from the bimodal breeding season 20 years found in the 1970s. The effects of extensive grenade fishing practices during the 1980s might have played a substantial role in the observed change. Grenade fishing stopped in 1991, and the number of N. nematopus pairs increased by 136% from 1990 to 1995. With increased density of breeding fish, the breeding season for this species also expanded. The balance between divergent selection due to competition for breeding sites and stabilizing selection due to predation pressure on offspring is likely to mold the breeding season for N. nematopus and other cichlids of Lake Xiloa. We suggest that brood adoption and synchrony of breeding is a strategy to reduce predation on the parent's own young [Current Zoology 56 (1): 43-51 2010].																			1674-5507					FEB	2010	56	1					43	51		10.1093/czoolo/56.1.43	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/56.1.43													WOS:000277409400006
J	Stevenson, JT; Secor, DH				Stevenson, JT; Secor, DH			Age determination and growth of Hudson River Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus	FISHERY BULLETIN												Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) are a large anadromous fish which is especially vulnerable to overharvesting owing to its late age of maturity and low rate of reproduction. Age determination methods and growth rates are poorly described for this species. Pectoral-fin spine sections and sagittal otolith sections were examined to determine whether one of these structures would be useful in estimating the age and growth of Atlantic sturgeon. Otoliths have been difficult to collect, process, and interpret. Interpretation of annuli in sectioned pectoral spines has proven to be an unbiased method for aging juvenile and adult Hudson River Atlantic sturgeon. Marginal increment analysis has indicated an annual cycle of annulus deposition. Microchemical analysis with an electron microprobe of the periphery of fin spines has shown seasonal patterns of calcium and phosphorus concentrations related to the translucent and opaque zones of the annuli. Formation of yearly annuli was verified in 4-year-old laboratory-reared sturgeon. Von Bertalanffy growth models (based upon fin-spine interpretations) were fitted for the Hudson River population. Models predicted a more rapid growth rate for males than for females (females: K=0.07, L(infinity)=251 cm; males: K=0.25, L(infinity)=180 cm). Females, however, attained a greater maximum age (42 yr) and size (TL=277 cm). We believe that exploitation has had a large but unquantifiable bias on growth estimates for male and female Atlantic sturgeon. As the Hudson River population recovers, age structure and growth rate estimates should be refined to predict population recovery rates more accurately in the absence of a directed fishery.

Since filling in January 1994, almost the whole water column has remained anoxic, with high concentrations of reduced elements (CH4, iron sulphides, H2S) originating from degradation of the submerged primary forest. These elements deoxygenated the water drained from the dam, as they were biologically and chemically oxidized in the river. Two major physiological guilds of microorganisms occurred. They showed a characteristic stratified arrangement in the lake, below and above an oxycline. Since flooding, we observed a cyclic development of phototrophic bacteria, assumed to be sulphur-oxidizers below the oxycline. The growth of this physiological guild seems to be strongly influenced by sulphide production and by the alternation between rainy and dry seasons. At the oxycline, the population of methane-oxidizing bacteria did not vary in the same way as the green sulphur bacteria. After a lag-phase, which was probably due to inhibition by excessive illumination in the upper water column in 1994, they developed and completely stopped diffusive methane emission in February 1995. The development of both bacterial guilds is directly correlated to changes in the level of the corresponding reduced elements from the bottom and dissolved in the lake water. The decreasing production of CH4 and sulphides induces a progressive extinction of methanotrophic bacteria and phototrophic sulphur-oxidizing bacteria. Meanwhile, the water is becoming clearer and algal populations proliferate in the upper water column, constituting an autochtonous source of organic carbon. Slowly, this aquatic ecosystem is reaching a low-activity equilibrium level related to reduced element production. It is evolving from a system ruled by an anaerobic organotrophic metabolism to an ecosystem governed by phototrophy.																			0018-8158					APR	1999	400						75	83		10.1023/A:1003707129170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003707129170													WOS:000083171500007

These ecosystems lodge a wealth of 62 families, 60 of them present during the rainy season and 46 during the dry period. At both times Coleoptera is the order with a greater number of families, followed by Diptera. The first one is the most diverse, but Chironomidae (Diptera) is the most abundant, representing 40% of the total number of individuals. We used high rank taxa to quantify the biodiversity based on the principle that a high number of families or genus is supposed to include a greater number of species. There were not significant differences in the alpha diversity within the same lake during the two climatic seasons. The trophic structure is dominated by the detritivorous groups (57% of scrapers, collectors, gatherers, shredders), followed by predators (38%) and herbivores (5%). These numbers indicate that dune lakes have a great amount of organic matter. The results obtained contradict our working hypothesis, thus it was rejected, in summary, because there were no important differences in family composition, abundance of individuals and trophic structure of the lakes between the rainy and dry seasons.

Hyalella azteca was the only species found residing in the littoral area of the lakes. Mean annual density ranged from 1042 +/- 3544 ind/m(2) up to 13496 +/- 20740 ind/m(2). Seasonal (dry and rainy seasons) changes did not significantly affect density. In terms of abundance, juveniles dominated (55-64%) over females (13-20%), males (10-17%), and ovigerous females (8-14%). Ovigerous females held from I up to 38 eggs. Sex ratio (male: female) ranged from 1: 1 (1.0) to 1:3.25 (0.31). Hyalella azteca developed along the ample range of environmental conditions present in the littoral zone of the crater lakes of Puebla. No statistically significant correlations between abiotic factors and H. azteca abundance in these lakes were found.

Twelve fishes and one amphibian are important in the fishery, which is conducted largely from small wooden boats using seines, gill nets, and the traditional butterfly net. Fishery yields from the lake peaked in 1988, but have declined to near record lows since then. We propose a management plan to restore the fishery. Key components of the plan include: 1) licensing and restricting the number of fishermen; 2) continuing a recent ban on seines and implementing limits on the number and mesh sizes of gill nets to allow fish to complete at least one spawning before they are vulnerable to harvest; 3) establishing a closed season and areas closed to fishing to protect spawning fish; 4) increased education for fishermen in basic skills, fishing technology, and alternative jobs; 5) continued monitoring and research to assess trends in the fishery and to develop culture techniques to help restore fish populations; and 6) compliance and enforcement mechanisms to make the plan effective, including perhaps establishment of property rights for particular areas of the lake for specific groups of fishermen and more generally an equitable assignment of lake ecosystem uses between fishery and non-fishery users. We recommend the plan be implemented in an adaptive fashion with provisions for adjusting regulations as conditions warrant. If at least some elements of this plan are not adopted then the Lake Patzcuaro fishery is likely to collapse.																			0960-3166						2002	12	2					207	217		10.1023/A:1025087705940	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025087705940													WOS:000184595600010

Data were obtained from on-site surveys carried out between April 1998 and January 2000. Six parasite species were identified: Dactylogyrus macracanthus Wegener, 1909; Asymphlodora tincae (Mooder, 1790); Acanthocephalus lucii (Muller, 1787); Ergasilus sieboldi Nordmann, 1832; Argulus foliaceus Linne, 1758; and Piscicola geometra Linne, 1758. Of these species, three were found on gills of the tench: D. macracanthus (prevalence 15.0%; mean intensity 12.10+/-7.39), A. foliaceus (4.2%; 2.67+/-1.51), E. sieboldi (32.1%; 53.88+/-33.96); P. geometra was found on the skin (1.4%; 1.00+/-0.00); A. lucii in the intestine (2.8%; 1.75+/-0.58) and A. tincae in the gut and intestine of the host fish specimens (26.4%; 87.70+/-108.31). In addition, the density of parasite species was determined according to season as well as according to size of the host fish.

J	Rioual, P				Rioual, P			Limnological characteristics of 25 lakes of the French Massif Central	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Concentrations of a wide range of chemical variables were determined in 206 water samples taken between May 1996 and May 1998 from a set of 25 natural lakes in the French Massif Central. From each lake 6 to 9 samples were collected. Mean and standard deviation of total alkalinity, conductivity, pH, concentrations in K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ Na+ Cl-, SO42 total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen, dissolved silica, chlorophyll a, and water colour were calculated for each lake. These results are briefly compared with those obtained in an earlier study in which chemical analyses were carried out on a reduced set of lakes from the same region. In most lakes and for most elements, concentrations observed in the present study were similar to those observed previously. The seasonal variations of the elements which are most strongly influenced by biological processes were also investigated. Using hierarchical cluster analysis three main lake groups were distinguished : i) alkaline lakes, ii) deep lakes with low alkalinity and iii) shallow lakes with low alkalinity. The major patterns of variation in the data set were also investigated using principal components analysis (PCA), which confirms that total alkalinity and maximum water depth are the main environmental gradients in this set of lakes. In conclusion, the potential of this data-set for building diatom-based transfer functions to reconstruct past limnological conditions is discussed.

J	WHITING, GJ				WHITING, GJ			CO2 EXCHANGE IN THE HUDSON-BAY LOWLANDS - COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS AND MULTISPECTRAL REFLECTANCE PROPERTIES	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Net ecosystem CO2 exchange was measured during the 1990 growing season (June to August) along a transect starting 10 km inland from James Bay and extending 100 km interior to Kinosheo Lake, Ontario. Sites were chosen in three distinct areas: a coastal fen, an interior fen, and a bog. For the most productive sites in the bog net daily uptake rates reached a maximum of 2.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) with an area-weighted exchange of 0.3 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) near midsummer. This site was estimated to be a net carbon source of 9 g C-CO2 m(-2) to the atmosphere over a 153-day growing season. The interior fen was less productive on a daily basis with a net maximum uptake of 0.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and with corresponding area-weighted uptake of 0.1 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during midsummer. Early and late season release of carbon to the atmosphere resulted in a net loss of 21 g C-CO2 m(-2) over the growing season from this site. The coastal fen was the most productive site with uptake rates peaking near 1.7 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) which corresponded to an area-weighted uptake of 0.8 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during midsummer and an estimated net uptake of 6 g C-CO2 m(-2) for the growing season. Associated with net CO2 exchange measurements, multispectral reflectance properties of the sites were measured over the growing season using portable radiometers. These properties were related to exchange rates with the goal of examining the potential for. satellite remote sensing to monitor biosphere/atmosphere CO2 exchange in this biome. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed fi om surface reflectance was correlated with net CO2 exchange for all sites with the exception of areas with large proportions of Sphagnum moss cover. These mosses have greater near-infrared reflectance than typical surrounding vegetation and may require special adjustment for regional exchange/remote sensing applications.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 20	1994	99	D1					1519	1528		10.1029/93JD01833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JD01833													WOS:A1994MT03200039
J	Mukabana, JR; Pielke, RA				Mukabana, JR; Pielke, RA			Investigating the influence of synoptic-scale monsoonal winds and mesoscale circulations on diurnal weather patterns over Kenya using a mesoscale numerical model	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) developed at Colorado State University (CSU) was used to investigate the influence of the large-scale monsoonal winds and the mesoscale local circulations on the diurnal precipitation pattern over Kenya. Three basic experiments were performed. In the first control experiment (CONTROL),RAMS was initialized using observational data (''variable initialization'') from the global analyzed ECMWF 2.5 degrees X 2.5 degrees data of 0000 UTC 14 April 1985. The model was integrated forward in time for 24 h to simulate the large-scale Bow fields over Kenya. Full physics including moist convection were implemented in the model. The model outputs were validated against available observations in order to determine the ability of the model in replicating the synoptic climatology prevailing over the study domain. In the second experiment (MESO), the model simulation was started from an atmosphere at rest in order to exclude the large-scale flow from the model runs. This experiment used a horizontally homogeneous procedure to initialize the model. Moist convection was allowed to occur in the mesoscale simulations. The third experiment (SYNO) excluded topography and land-water contrast data from the simulation. This was done in order to suppress the thermally induced local mesoscale circulations from the model runs so as to isolate and determine the role played by the synoptic scale monsoonal winds on the generation of precipitation over Kenya. Topography was considered a local forcing that significantly modifies the large scale temperature, moisture, and flow pattern. Comparison was made between grid-averaged convective precipitation generated in the CONTROL, MESO, and SYNO simulations in order to identify the contribution of the synoptic-scale monsoonal Bow and mesoscale circulations on the rainfall over Kenya. Additional sensitivity experiments were performed to test the impact of topography and large water bodies on the precipitation over the country. The results showed the following. More active convection developed in regions where the large-scale monsoonal winds in the lower troposphere converged with the local mesoscale circulations embedded in the large-scale Bow. The large-scale flow advected substantially more moisture into the study domain as compared to the mesoscale flow alone. This illustrated the fact that monsoonal winds transport moisture from the Indian Ocean and advect it inland over the country. The large-scale monsoonal flow controlled the locations and movement of the convergence/precipitating zones over the country since the deep and active convective zones shifted in the direction of the prevailing low-level large-scale monsoonal flow. Topography has a significant impact on the diurnal precipitation pattern over the country. It generates anabatic-katabatic winds with a strong diurnal cycle; it modifies the large-scale temperature, moisture, and wind flow patterns over the country; and it also inhibits a substantial amount of the moisture-laden monsoonal winds from reaching farther inland over the country. The large water bodies (Lake Victoria, Lake Turkana and the Indian Ocean) generate strong lake-land, sea-land-breeze circulations with an intense diurnal cycle that contributes to the overall precipitation pattern over the country. It was concluded that the large-scale monsoonal winds and the mesoscale circulations are both crucial components in the realization of rainfall in Kenya during a wet season. The study similarly revealed the ability of the high-resolution RAMS model to replicate realistic meteorological fields for both large-scale and mesoscale weather systems in an equatorial regime.

J	Feiner, ZS; Brey, MK; Burgett, C				Feiner, Zachary S.; Brey, Marybeth K.; Burgett, Caroline			Consistently High Trophic Overlap between Invasive White Perch and Native Black Crappies in Southeastern Reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The detrimental impacts of invasive species often occur through deleterious trophic interactions (e.g., competition) with native species. However, the potential for competitive interactions between species may vary among systems, among seasons, or throughout the species' ontogeny, requiring a thorough examination of trophic niches to determine whether overlap exists and to elucidate the likelihood of competition. The Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus is a popular game fish species across the United States, but recent invasions of White Perch Morone americana, which exploit a similar trophic niche, into southern reservoirs represent a major concern for the continued sustainability of Black Crappie fisheries. We examined the trophic niches of these species throughout their ontogeny in two North Carolina reservoirs during 2009 and 2010 using a combination of diet content and stable isotope analyses. Extensive and significant similarities in diet composition and isotopic niche overlap existed between Black Crappies and White Perch throughout their ontogeny and across seasons in both systems. Overlap was particularly high between smaller (<200-mm), invertivorous Black Crappies and all sizes of White Perch. This overlap suggests that if invertebrate resources become limited, competition during the juvenile stage could reduce growth rates and survival of young Black Crappies. By evaluating variation in the trophic niches of each species among seasons, body sizes, and reservoirs, we conclude that the potential for competitive interactions between White Perch and Black Crappie is high in southern reservoirs. Management options to either reduce White Perch abundance or prevent their spread to novel habitats may be necessary to sustain native and supplemented Black Crappie populations that are potentially vulnerable to White Perch invasions.

Two video sampling methods were used-quadrat (a stationary camera with a fixed viewing area) and line sampling (camera walked through the stream). Compared to electrofishing surveys, underwater camera data suggested simpler fish communities (biased towards salmonids) and smaller sized fish. Shallow water depths, turbulence, and obstructions (eg., woody debris) limited our ability to identify fish during some of the video samples. Video sampling-was able to detect a decreasing trend of fish abundance as water temperatures declined over the course of the study. There was also a strong agreement between measurements of streambed particle sizes done manually in the field and those done with both video sampling methods. The results suggest that a portable underwater camera system could be used to measure seasonal changes in habitat use by salmonid fish species and certain habitat features in streams and rivers.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2003	18	2					269	276		10.1080/02705060.2003.9664493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2003.9664493													WOS:000182685800011
J	Xiao, CX; Desser, SS				Xiao, CX; Desser, SS			The oligochaetes and their actinosporean parasites in Lake Sasajewun, Algonquin Park, Ontario	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												There is little ecological information on actinosporean parasites and their oligochaete hosts. Between 1995 and 1997, about 14,100 oligochaetes belonging to 19 species were collected from Lake Sasajewun. The oligochaete fauna consisted of 5 tubificid, 10 naidid, 3 enchytraeid, and 1 lumbriculid species. The most widely distributed species in the lake were Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Dero nivea, and Stylaria lacustris, with L. hoffmeisteri being the most prevalent. The diversity and abundance of worms decreased with increased water depth. Four species, L. hoffmeisteri, Tubifex tubifex, Rhyacodrilus coccineus, and Lumbriculus variegatus, harbored actinosporean parasites and were distributed along shallow areas of the lake shore where the sediment was comprised mainly of clay-mud, with the shoregrass, Littorella americana. The actinosporean parasites of the oligochaetes belong to 25 forms of 8 collective groups. Triactinomyxon 'F' was the most prevalent form, whereas triactinomyxon, raabeia, and echinactinomyxon were the most speciose groups; The overall prevalence of actinosporeans was about 1%. Waterborne spores of different actinosporean forms showed distinct temporal patterns. Spores of triactinomyxon 'F' occurred throughout the sampling season, whereas spores of other forms occurred only at certain times. The presence of waterborne spores peaked from late June to August when water temperatures ranged from 18 to 24 C and coincided with the feeding and growing season of larval fish.																			0022-3395					OCT	1998	84	5					1020	1026		10.2307/3284636	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3284636								9794646					WOS:000076517900024

In drinking water treatment, TOC is a precursor to disinfection byproducts such as total trihalomethanes (TTHM). With the aid of an early warning system for the detection of TOC concentrations, water treatment operators could make more informed decisions and adjust the treatment processes to minimize the generation of disinfection byproducts. In this paper, a near real-time monitoring system is explored using the Integrated Data Fusion and Machine-learning (IDFM) technique to predict the spatial distribution of TOC in a lake based upon surface reflectance data from satellite imagery. Landsat 5 TM and MODIS Terra satellite imagery can be acquired free of charge, yet MODIS has coarse spatial resolution, while Landsat has a lengthy 16 day revisit time. This difficulty is solved using data fusion algorithms to fuse the fine spatial resolution of Landsat with the daily revisit time of MODIS to generate a synthetic image with both high spatial and temporal resolution. To demonstrate the capabilities of IDFM, this case study uses the fused surface reflectance band data and applied machine-learning techniques to reconstruct the spatiotemporal distribution of TOC in Harsha Lake, which serves as the source water intake for the McEwen Water Treatment Plant in Ohio. The results of this application of IDFM were analyzed using 4 statistical indices, which indicated that the Artificial Neural Network model is capable of reconstructing TOC concentrations throughout the lake.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9230-2				2012	8513								851307	10.1117/12.927632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.927632													WOS:000312366600005

The Iecava and Memele rivers border the area with extensive surface karst features such as sinkholes and karst lakes. Earlier investigations suggested a hydraulic connection between the Iecava and Memele rivers exists via the karst conduits due to the water level (WL) difference in the rivers. A set of methods was performed to study the possible connection: dye tracer was applied in the Iecava river and its occurrence was visually observed at the karst lakes and Memele river; the current velocity was measured and discharge of rivers calculated at several profiles; surface water and groundwater composition was studied involving in situ measurements of water pH and electrical conductivity, water sampling and chemical analysis of the water samples on the content of sulphates, calcium and magnesium ions. A numerical finite element 3D groundwater flow model was developed to assess the impact of WL changes in rivers to groundwater flow. The study showed that there is direct hydraulic connection between the rivers - water from the Iecava river flows to the Memele river. The groundwater discharge to the Memele river varies seasonally, and more intensive groundwater discharge is observed during the high season.					; Popovs, Konrāds/HPB-8917-2023	Sennikovs, Juris/0000-0002-1337-2693; 													1998-9563						2012	43	4					445	459		10.2166/nh.2012.123	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2012.123													WOS:000306235400013
J	Hartmann, H				Hartmann, Heike			Neural Network Based Seasonal Predictions of Lake-Effect Snowfall	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												In the case of the city of Buffalo (New York, United States), located on the eastern shore of Lake Erie and, therefore, strongly influenced by the lake-effect, total monthly snowfall was predicted one to six months in advance. For this, neural network (NN) techniques, specifically a multi-layer perceptron, as well as a multiple linear regression (LR) model were applied. The period of analysis comprised 28 years from January 1982 to December 2009. Input data included surface air temperature; the temperature difference between the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) and the 850 hPa air temperature; the u-component of the wind (u-wind) and the v-component of the wind (v-wind), geopotential height (GPH) over Lake Erie and the surrounding regions at the 1000, 925, 850 and 700 hPa levels as well as the surface pressure; the 500 hPa GPH over James Bay, Canada; the surface pressure over the Great Plains; and the mean water temperature and LSWT of Lake Erie, as well as the amount of ice cover. Moreover, several teleconnection indices were implemented: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Different lead times for the input variables were tested for their suitability. The most accurate result was obtained using the NN with an optimized one-month lead time approach (lead times varied between one and six months for the different input variables).

Nets of different types (seines, trap nets and gillnets) with various mesh sizes and length were used for sampling. Samples were collected from 3 horizontal strata. In the samples collected, most vendace were age 1+ and 2+ although a few individuals lived to age 4. Vendace is the dominant species comprising 70% of the annual catch. Catches from this study were compared with historical data. It was found that the annual abundance of vendace decreased dramatically from 1994 to present, from 50 tonnes to 17 tonnes or less annually. The average size of vendace in catches has also decreased in recent years. We believe intensive poaching, in addition to commercial fishing, climate changes and global warming, are the leading factors that have caused the decrease in overall number of individuals and the smaller sizes of adult vendace in the current population.					; Japoshvili, Bella/C-8934-2015	Japoshvili, Bella/0000-0003-0966-0622; 													1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						363	369																WOS:000313086600024

However, information on the impact of the TN/TP ratio on phytoplankton biomass in artificial reservoirs with unstable physical boundary has been little studied. Here, we performed a 2-year biweekly monitoring program in the Pengxi River Backwater Area (PBA), a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir (the Yangtze River), to document the relationship of TN/TP ratio and phytoplankton. Based on Spearman Correlation Analysis, we found that significant seasonal variation of TN, TP, and TN/TP ratio was unrelated to variation in phytoplankton biomass. Three subsets of the 2-year data were divided according to reservoir operation mode and seasonal growth of phytoplankton to gain a deeper insight in their relationship. In the non-growth season, when water residence time in the PBA is longer due to impoundment in the Three Gorge Reservoir (TGR) and to decline of river discharge in the dry season, release of TN and TP from the newly submerged water fluctuation zone increased the input of nutrients and the ratio of TN/TP. This process co-occurred with a decline in the growth of phytoplankton, resulting in a positive correlation between TN/TP ratio and phytoplankton biomass. In the growth season, low water residence time (HRT < 50 day), intensive water exchange, and mass transport from river discharge at low water level caused unstable hydrodynamic conditions for the growth of phytoplankton. Light availability might be the controlling factor that regulated the biomass of phytoplankton. In the growth season with long water residence times (HRT >= 50 day), a relatively stable physical environment supported the occurrence of N-fixation in the PBA.																			0077-0639		978-94-007-2006-0				2012	91						193	210		10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_12	10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7												WOS:000301802900012
S	Lin, QQ; Han, BP		Han, BP; Liu, ZW		Lin, Qiuqi; Han, Bo-Ping			Diversity and Community Structure of Zooplankton in Reservoirs in South China	TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL RESERVOIR LIMNOLOGY IN CHINA: THEORY AND PRACTICE	Monographiae Biologicae											Zooplankton diversity and its response to eutrophication were investigated in 15 reservoirs of South China from 2000 to 2003. So far, 105 species of Rotifera, 30 species of Cladocera and 24 species of Copepoda have been identified. The majority of rotifer species are monogononts, with bdelloids represented by Rotaria sp. only. Lecane (with 19 taxa), Trichocerca (15) and Brachionus (11) are the most speciose genera, with many species cosmopolitan. The most frequently observed genera were Keratella, Brachionus, Polyarthra,Trichocerca, Asplanchna, Conochilus, Ploesoma, Ascomorpha and Pompholyx. Daphniidae (10 species) and Chydoridae (11) were the two rich cladoceran families. Bosmina tripurae, Bosminopsis deitersi, Diaphanosoma orghidani, D. dubium, Moina micrura, daphnia cornuta and C. quadrangula were most frequent in the pelagic zone. In addition, 10 calanoid and 14 cyclopoid species of copepocls occurred. Most of the Calanoida are endemic to the tropics and subtropics in China. Phyllodiaptomus tunguidus, Neodiaptomus schmackeri, Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides and Thermocyclops taihokuensis were most frequently recorded. In the year 2000, total abundance of zooplankton varied from 11 to 290 ind./L during the period of June to July. Zooplankton was much more abundant in mesotrophic than in oligotrophic and eutrophic reservoirs. Rotifera numerically predominated in nine reservoirs and Copepoda in six reservoirs. The relative abundance of Brachionus, Trichocerca and Asplanchna increased and the ratio of Calanoida to Cyclopoida decreased with trophic level. Reservoir trophic state and predation were the most direct factors regulating zooplankton abundance and the dynamics of community structure. However, it was also found that hydraulic retention time affected the response of the zooplankton community structure to eutrophication. In reservoirs with long or short retention times, zooplankton showed no apparent variation across seasons. In reservoirs with intermediate retention time, in contrast, the zooplankton community changed significantly with trophy.

Sampling was performed in different freshwater bodies along the eastern (Casamento Lake area) and western (near the city of Tapes) banks of the Patos Lagoon (30 degrees 40' S-30 degrees 10' S and 50 degrees 30' W-51 degrees 30' W). The samples were collected once in the rainy season and once in the dry season (from May 2003 to December 2003) using a plankton net (25 mu m mesh) in pelagic and littoral zones, and by squeezing the submerged parts of aquatic macrophytes. Thirty one species belonging to the families Synechoccocaceae (7 taxa), Merismopediaceae (12 taxa), Chamaesiphonaceae (1 taxon), Microcystaceae (4) and Chroococcaceae (7 taxa) were identified. Among these species, five are reported for the first time in Rio Grande do Sul State: Chamaesiphon amethystinus (Rostafinski) Lemmermann, Chroococcus minimus (Keissler) Lemmermann, Coelomoron pusillum (Van Goor) Komarek, Coelosphaerium kuetzingeanum Naegeli, and Cyanodictyon tubiforme Cronberg.

Anatomical and histological structures of gonads, oogenesis and spermatogenesis processes along with the determination of sexual maturity age of female (n=43) and male (n=27) individuals and spawning periods of the species were determined. Seasonal variations of gonads were illustrated. Five different oogenesis phases (chromatin nucleolar, perinucleolar, cortical alveolar, vitellogenic and maturation) and three different spermatogenesis phases (immature, maturing and mature testis) were identified. Results indicated that chub has a group syncrone type ovary, has a short reproduction season and spawn at once or twice times per year. Males reached to sexual maturity at II and III ages, and females reached to sexual maturity at III age. In addition, spawning period started at the end of May and went on through the end of June. Both oocyte and spermatocyte development and maturation were similar with the species belong to the subfamily Leuciscinae. (C) 2011 PVJ.

Modelling seasonal increments in size to determine the onset of annual growth in fishes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												A new method based on modelling of seasonal growth increments (G(SI)) in total length was found useful for assessing the date of onset of annual growth for 16 fish species in a temperate fluvial lake. Model comparisons indicated that polynomial (linear or quadratic) functions provided better fits to seasonal growth and were more likely to avoid convergence problems than alternative non-linear models. There was little evidence for differences in the date of onset of growth between years, nor among age classes within individual species. The onset of growth also was to some extent synchronized among species and was concentrated within a narrow temporal window of c. 2 weeks, between 18 May and 2 June, which corresponded to mean water temperatures between 16.1 and 17.3 degrees C. There was no apparent relationship between date of onset and species' thermal preferenda or thermal preferences. By producing a point estimate along with appropriate 95% CI, the G(SI) method provides useful information on the onset of growth and the uncertainty about that estimate. The G(SI) analyses can contribute to a better understanding of environmental influences on the onset of growth and the length of the growing season, and of thermal thresholds for growth, including their use in calculation of degree-day metrics.

Allometry and condition index in the freshwater bivalve Parreysia favidens (Benson, 1862) from river Bhadra, India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												The morphometry, length-weight relationship and condition index of the freshwater bivalve Parreysia favidens (Benson, 1862) inhabiting the river Bhadra in the Western Ghats were examined from October 2001 to December 2002. The linear regression equations of length-breadth and length-width for the entire study period were L = 0.2653 + 0.5992 B and L = 0.2176 + 0.4403 W respectively. The monthly b values of length-breadth and length-width relationships varied from 0.5371 (November 2002) to 0.6915 (July 2002) and from 0.4132 (October 2002) to 0.5242 (July 2002) respectively. The data on length-total weight (W= 0.2418 L-2.785), length- wet tissue weight (W=0.04859 L-2.599) and length-dry weight (W=0.01177 L-2.499) showed non-linear patterns. The coefficient of allometry, b ranged from 2.2485 (November 2002) to 3.4107 (July 2002) for length-total weight relationship and from 2.2779 (December 2002) to 2.8346 (January 2002) for length-wet tissue weight relationship. The values for length-dry tissue weight relationship fluctuated between 2.1528 (December 2002) and 2.9736 (January 2002). The monthly mean values of the condition index varied from 4.57 (October 2001) to 8.95 (April 2002). The variation in condition index followed the breeding period and seasons. The data indicated that the condition of mussels was fairly good from April to October. The best time for commercial exploitation appears to be during April to October when the mussels are in good condition.

Batch fecundity and spawning frequency of H. leucisculus were studied in Erhai Lake, China, in which the fish, as an exotic species, has become a successful colonizer. Spawning frequency was 16.05 %, as determined from the percent of females with postovulatory follicles 12 to 36 h old during the peak reproductive period (from May 27 to August 8). The average interval between spawning was 6.2 days and there were more than 16 total spawning batches during the peak reproductive period. The average batch fecundity (mean +/- SD) was 11,934 +/- 5,921 hydrated oocytes in 40 females (standard length or SL: 9.1-14.4 cm), while relative batch fecundity was 560 +/- 137 eggs g(-1) wet weight. The total potential annual fecundity was approximately 190,944 oocytes over the whole spawning season and was much higher than the estimated standing stock (31,585 oocytes) of yolked oocytes (36 females, SL: 9.5-16.2 cm) at the beginning of the spawning season in April 2010. This high annual fecundity is likely to have contributed to successful invasion of Erhai Lake by H. leucisculus.

They often accumulate in lake sediments where they can be used as indicators of environmental change. Currently, they are the only natural terrestrial proxies for cold-season climate. However, incomplete understanding of stomatocyst biology and inconsistencies in stomatocyst taxonomy have limited their application as an environmental proxy. "Stom@ocysts & Co" is introduced here as a web-based tool to facilitate and standardize cyst classification. The web site combines an image database, classification key, training tools, semantic Wiki, image gallery, and a community board to provide a collaborative, www-based platform for stomatocysts researchers.

Influence of Industrial, Agricultural and Sewage Water Discharges on Eutrophication of Quttina Lake	JORDAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The influence of human activities on water quality of Quttina lake (an important water resource in the middle region of Syria), has been evaluated and correlated with pollution source situated at lake banks; namely, phosphate fertilizer factory, agriculture and wastewater drainages. Surface and deep water samples from different sites in the lake have been collected and analyzed during the period of April to October 2009 to study the effects of pollution sources on Quttina lake eutrophication. Water quality parameters include temperature, pH, EC, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), ammonium, phosphate and nitrates ions, total nitrogen and total phosphorous. The results have shown that these parameters varied from one site to another, where the highest concentrations were found to be in those sites close to phosphate factory discharges and in the northern part of the lake. Moreover, seasonal variations in pollution parameters were clear, especially for ammonium, phosphate and nitrates ions in addition to oxygen parameters (DO, COD and BOD). Moreover, mean total phosphorus concentration in Quttina lake surface water varied between 0.51 mg/l and 2.2 mg/l, where the highest values were found to be near the phosphate fertilizer factory discharges in addition to sites close to wastewater and agriculture runoffs situated at the western side of the lake. In addition, N:P ratio varied between 1.1 and 22.9 during the sampling period; the natural ratio being 16: 1. On the other hand, the parameter distribution with depth in two sites has been studied. The results have shown that there are no clear differences between the deep and surface samples, and this is due to lake shallow depth and water flow. Furthermore, positive relationships have been found between total phosphors and nitrogen and oxygen indicators (BOD and COD), which indicates the increase of organic pollution and the algal bloom.																			1993-0461	2225-157X					2010	4	4					351	366																WOS:000434609300005
J	McNaughton, KA; Lee, PF				McNaughton, Kimberly A.; Lee, Peter F.			Water Quality Effects from an Aquaculture Operation in a Meromictic Iron Pit Lake in Northwestern Ontario, Canada	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												In 1989, aquaculture for the production of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was started in the upper depths of the 180-m deep Caland pit lake formed after the flooding of the former Steeprock Iron Mine. After ten years of operation, water quality was shown to be affected by the fish farm as well as proximal waste and the surficial geology of the area. Meromictic conditions occurred in the pit lake with a dichotomy in water quality versus depth. A cluster of parameters (ammonia, total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, B, pH, dissolved oxygen) were either in higher concentrations in the mixolimnion or varied little throughout the entire water column, and a second cluster of parameters had higher levels below the chemocline (conductivity, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, total dissolved solids, nitrate, sulfate, Ca, Mg, hardness, Na, Cl, K, Fe, Mn, Sr, and silicon dioxide). Statistically significant variations in concentrations among many of these chemical parameters were observed between the two years of study, among depths, and among seasons. Nutrient loading from excess fish food and waste increased phosphorus and ammonia levels. The expansion of the fish farm also reduced the levels of dissolved oxygen in the lower depths of the pit lake, thus reducing the volume of usable water for aquaculture purposes. In the early 2000s the fish farm decreased production and those closed in 2006. Later data showed that nitrate and potassium had corresponding decreases in both the monimolimnion and the mixolimnion. Sulfate levels remained elevated.																			1201-3080						2010	45	1					13	24		10.2166/wqrj.2010.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2010.003													WOS:000287596800002

Independent hydrologic and hydrodynamic models, coupled with a particle tracking model, were used to delimit resource shed total spatial extent and relative contributory importance for selected receptors in Lake Erie (North America) over varying time intervals. One resource shed was extended into the Maumee River watershed (OH) by integrating the lake and hydrologic models. Model validation was achieved through comparison with data from the 2005 International Field Years on Lake Erie (IFYLE) study. Resource shed size, orientation, and internal structure varied with receptor location, in-lake circulation, terrestrial precipitation, time interval, and season. River plume extent and interaction were illustrated, and model integration revealed the relative contributory importance of subwatershed catchments to an off-shore receptor.																			0013-936X					JAN 1	2010	44	1					329	334		10.1021/es900562t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es900562t								19958021					WOS:000273267000055

S	Wüest, A		Bundi, U		Wueest, Alfred			Downstream Relevance of Reservoir Management	ALPINE WATERS	Handbook of Environmental Chemistry Series											The management of dams serves many purposes and goals all over the globe, and has important consequences for the downstream rivers and lakes. Among the more than 50,000 so-called large dams, the biggest are located in alpine regions. As a result, the water residence time in heavily dammed alpine valleys typically increased from a few days to several weeks, hydrological regimes shifted seasonally and sediment transport often decreased to half of its natural value. The occurrence of high flows responsible for most particle transport is reduced and particles are trapped behind the dams. These changes modify particle concentrations and particle size distributions, thermal regimes and water quality in downstream waters. As a result, downstream rivers and pre-alpine lakes often experience significant alterations in particle, carbon and nutrient cycling. Also described are common mitigation measures that are often applied in newly-planned damming management.

Assuming climate change leads to less precipitation in the Mono basin, we simulated the frequency and duration of meromixis for three hydrological scenarios in which precipitation and runoff were 100, 87.5, and 75% of those recorded for the 50-yr period from 1940 to 1990 with the assumption of no diversion of streamflow. Simulations indicate that Mono Lake would be susceptible to meromixis over a large range of lake levels for all three scenarios during very large runoff years. Climatic reconstructions and hydrological data also indicate a recent trend of higher interannual variability in precipitation and runoff in the Sierra Nevada. To assess the effect of higher interannual runoff variability on the frequency of meromixis in Mono Lake, we ran the 87.5 and 75% 50-yr freshwater inputs with no reductions in the eight largest runoff years. A higher incidence of meromixis was predicted when high runoff years were interspersed with drought periods that kept the lake at levels susceptible to long-term chemical stratification.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1996	41	5					955	965		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0955	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0955													WOS:A1996VN45800018

Total (sum of dissolved and particulate) inventories of stable Pb, Pb-210, and Po-210 increased in the whole lake during the latter part of the oxic stage of the lake and were attributed to diffusion from sediments. Large decreases in the total inventories of these elements occurred during the transition from oxic to anoxic conditions, and the lowest inventories were observed during the sulfidic stage of stratification. The cycling of stable Pb and Pb-210 during oxic periods appeared to be linked to Fe cycling while Po-2l0 cycling was more closely linked to the cycling of Mn. The behavior of stable and radioactive Pb and, possibly, Po-210 during anoxia was influenced by sulfur cycling. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that dissolved Pb concentrations might be controlled by PbS precipitation during anoxia. Flux balance calculations during stratification indicated that atmospheric deposition was the major source of both Pb-210 and Po-210 to the lake and fluvial input was more important for Po-210 than for Pb-210. Pb-210 and Po-210 supplied by atmospheric deposition were scavenged and removed by sedimentation from the epilimnion. Residence times with respect to scavenging and sedimentation in the epilimnion were 1-3 and 6-17 days, respectively, for Pb-210 and 9-22 and 9-26 days for Po-210. Model results in the hypolimnion indicated that at certain times the radionuclides diffused out of the sediments and at other times into the sediments. Residence times with respect to sedimentation of particulate nuclides in the hypolimnion were 2-124 days for Pb-210 and 8-48 days for Po-210. The behavior of Pb-210 and Po-210 in Lake Sammamish was compared to that in Bickford Reservoir, Massachusetts. Although the comparison indicated similarities (e.g., links to Fe and Mn cycling, larger scavenging rates for Pb-210 than for Po-210, the major differences between the systems were that atmospheric inputs were greater than fluvial inputs, activities of the radionuclides were lower, and the presence of sulfide in the hypolimnion during anoxia affected the cycling of stable Pb, Pb-210, and Po-210 in, Lake Sammamish.					; , James Murray/HCI-3547-2022	Murray, James/0000-0002-8577-7964; 													0016-7037					DEC	1995	59	23					4845	4861		10.1016/0016-7037(95)00334-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00334-7													WOS:A1995TJ54600005

Thus, it describes atmospheric deposition of particles and gases to the interface from rain and snow scavenging, dry deposition of particles, the exchange of gases and particles at the air-water interface, the sorption of gases at the interface, and the emission of particles and gases into the atmosphere. This chapter will concentrate on the exchange of gases at the air-water interface emphasizing the semivolatile organic chemicals (SOCs) such as the chlorinated hydrocarbons (polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]; hexachlorocyclohexanes [HCHs]) and the combustion-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). SOCs are characterized by subcooled liquid vapor pressures (P-L degrees) less than 10(-4) atm (similar to 10 Pa) and aqueous solubilities less than 10(-4) moles/L. These two physical-chemical parameters imply that SOCs are distributed between the gas and particle phase in the urban and rural atmosphere [1,2] and the dissolved and particle phase in the water column [3,4]. Little attention has been paid to the role of air-water exchange of SOCs in lakes, estuaries, and oceans of planet Earth. Whereas the transfer of low molecular weight, volatile, and biologically mediated gases such as O-2, CO2, CH4, H2S, DMS and 1 and 2 carbon halocarbons has received considerable attention for water quality, carbon cycling, global warming, and other reasons [5], the SOCs such as PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, PAHs, and toxaphene have been largely ignored until recently (see [6-13]). These compounds are derived from major anthropogenic emissions in urban/industrial centers and world-wide agriculture, transported globally, and often concentrated in the northern hemispheric atmosphere from 20 degrees N to 45 degrees N [14,15]. Recent studies suggest that air-water exchange of SOCs plays an important role in the mass balancing of inputs in large aquatic systems such as the Great Lakes and the world's oceans [6,8-10,12,13,16-22]. For example, the calculated volatilization flux of PCBs out of the North American Great Lakes [18,21-24] has been estimated to be comparable to sedimentation losses and may, in fact, be substantially greater in low sedimentation ecosystems such as Lake Superior [21]. There must be an appreciable cycling of SOCs between air and water with the magnitude and direction of net transfer changing with season and even with wind direction and speed. There is now convincing evidence that concentrations of SOCs and their residence times in large lakes are influenced, if not controlled, by air-water exchange [21,22,25,26]. Air-water exchange is also recognized as a dominant process for SOC input to the world's oceans [8,10,13,27]. The direction of gas transfer is not obvious unless the air and water concentrations of the SOCs are measured or accurately predicted and Henry's Law equilibrium is established, for it is the departure from equilibrium that drives the processes of gas volatilization and absorption.

Three field seasons of vegetation and terrain studies provided ground truth for a grid of 13 14 black-and-white air photos that cover ca. 24% of the forest-tundra and adjacent low Subarctic and low Arctic. Air photos were analyzed for percentage cover of nine vegetation-terrain types, bedrock and parent materials, landforms, and elevations. The forest-tundra, as bounded by the 1000:1 and 1:1000 tree:upland tundra cover isolines, spans an average 145 +/- 72 km (median 131 km) and increases in width from northwest to southeast. The transition from 10:1 to 1:10 tree:upland tundra cover occupies one-fourth to one-half the area of the forest-tundra. Regional slope of the land probably accounts for much of the variation in width of the forest-tundra. Southern outliers of forest tundra in the northwest are found mainly in areas of high elevation. Across much of the northwest, steep vegetation gradients occur near the northern limit of trees. North of Great Slave Lake, steep vegetation gradients shift from the northern to the southern half of the forest-tundra and maintain this position eastward to Hudson Bay. The forest-tundra of the northwest receives roughly three-fourths the mean annual net radiation available to the southeast and central districts.																			0004-0843					MAR	1992	45	1					1	9																WOS:A1992HM08400002

Four hundred big-scale sand smelts were caught with nets and analysed immediately. We created a total of 20 batches with 20 whole fish in each batch. Ten batches were analysed as raw samples, while the other 10 batches were analysed after being fried in sunflower oil at a temperature of 190 degrees C for 3 min (deep fat frying). The pH, proximate composition, fatty acid profile, oxidative stability and nutritional indexes of both groups were assessed. As expected, cooking strongly influenced the characteristics of the meat, mainly in terms of lipids, which were seven times greater in the fried product due to the oil. Frying also affected the fatty acid profile of the meat because oil absorption caused a significant increase in oleic and linoleic acids. Furthermore, we found a slight reduction in long chain n-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids). Frying increased oxidative processes and decreased the nutritional value of sand smelt. The obtained results can be considered preliminary because the effects of the fishing season and different physiological phases of sand smelt require further analytical confirmation.

Age, Growth, and Mortality Rates of the Giant Cichlid in Guatemala	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Age, growth, and mortality were assessed in Giant Cichlids Petenia splendida from lakes in northern Guatemala by using cross-sectioned sagittal otoliths. Marginal increment and edge analyses of Giant Cichlid otoliths indicated that one annulus formed per 12-month period in Lakes Yaxha and Peten Itza. Opaque zone formation was associated with the peak of the rainy season from May to September. Ages ranged from 0 to 8 years for Giant Cichlids in Lake Yaxha and from 0 to 5 years in Lake Peten Itza. Within both lakes, males were larger than females, although the difference was slight in Lake Peten Itza. Lake Yaxha Giant Cichlids had faster growth rates than those from Lake Peten Itza, and fish over 2 years old from Lake Yaxha were larger at age than fish from Lake Peten Itza. This is counter-intuitive because Lake Peten Itza is heavily exploited, whereas Lake Yaxha is unfished. However, long-term exploitation in Lake Peten Itza may have resulted in selection for fish with reduced growth rates. Alternatively, the mesotrophic state of Lake Yaxha may explain the differences in growth, although areas of Lake Peten Itza are changing from oligotrophic to meso-eutrophic due to rapid cultural eutrophication. Total mortality (Z) estimates for Giant Cichlids were 0.81 for Lake Yaxha, with most of the age structured on 2-4-year-old fish, and 1.05 for Lake Peten Itza, where the age structure was dominated by 0-2-year-old fish; these results were consistent with expectations based on the low fishing pressure in Lake Yaxha.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2019	148	1					176	190		10.1002/tafs.10128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10128													WOS:000456212400013
J	Bulut, C; Kubilay, A				Bulut, Cafer; Kubilay, Awgul			Seasonal change of water quality in Egirdir Lake (Isparta/Turkey)	SU URUNLERI DERGISI												This study was carried out seasonally in 9 stations selected to represent the lake in between April 2013 and January 2014. Physicochemical water quality analyzes were carried out in order to determine water quality parameters of Egirdir Lake. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, pH, electrical conductivity and salinity parameters were measured in situ. Turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulphate (SO4-2), carbonate (CO3-2) and bicarbonate (HCO3-2) alkalinity, calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), total hardness (TS), ammonium (NH4(+1)), potassium (K+1), sodium (Na+1), silicon (Si+1), nitrite (NO2-1), nitrate (NO3-1) and orthophosphate (O-PO4-3) were determined by titrimetric and spectrophotometric methods in the laboratory. On the average of the parameters in the obtained; water temperature 14,2 oC; dissolved oxygen 9,05 mg/L; pH 8,78; saturation 90,0%; electrical conductivity 383,4 mu S/cm and salinity 0,28 ppt as was determined. Parameters performed in the laboratory, on average, the turbidity 1,08 NTU; COD 17,0 mg/L; SO4-2 26,57 mg/L; O-PO4-3 0,05 mg/L; NH4+1 0,035 mg/L; NO 21 0,032 mg/L; NO3-1 1,2 mg/L; CO3-2 alkalinity 21,1 mg/L; HCO3-2 alkalinity 197,55 mg/L; Ca+2 23,46 mg/L; Mg+2 34,80 mg/L; TS 20 F-o; K+1 2,82 mg/L; Na+1 9,57 mg/L and Si+1 1,215 mg/L as was determined. As a result of the study, it was determined that water quality of Egirdir Lake is Class I water quality (High quality water) in terms of physical and some chemical parameters according to inland water quality standards. However, attention has to be paid to nitrogen and phosphorus. In this context, it is necessary to apply a good protection-use plan and program according to the characteristics of the basin and to take the necessary precautions in order to protect the lake.					; Bulut, Cafer/JCP-1503-2023	Bulut, Cafer/0000-0002-5525-170X; 													1300-1590	2148-3140					2019	36	1					13	23		10.12714/egejfas.2019.36.1.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.12714/egejfas.2019.36.1.02													WOS:000496712200002

Mineral elements are essential nutrients for the growth and life activities of animals, in order to carry out the protection work of Przewalski's gazelle, we are systematically studied the seasonal variation of mineral nutrient of alpine meadows in Hudong area of Qinghai Lake Basin. The results showed that the Hudong area belongs to selenium and molybdenum deficiency area, and the selenium and molybdenum content in the mixed forage was significantly lower than the reference value. The nutrient content of the mixed pasture has obvious seasonality, the mineral nutrient content of the mixed pasture in seedling stage and withering period was significantly higher than that in fast growth period, but there is no significant difference between seedling stage and withering period for pasture. The mineral nutrient contents of different forage varieties were also significantly different, Achnatherum splendens, Clematis tangutica and Artmisia desertorum were the main high selenium plants, among which the selenium content of Achnatherum splendens was the highest. Meanwhile, Achnatherum splendens was the basic food of Przewalski's gazelle, which accounted for 14.65% of the total food, but it was not the favorite plant for Przewalski's gazelle (Ei = -0.876). Therefore, increasing the proportion of high selenium plants and the selenium content of the mixed forage in the habitat of the Przewalski's gazelle are the main measures to protect the Przewalski's gazelle.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2019	28	2A					1457	1464																WOS:000461270800052

Impact of the three gorges reservoir operation on the hydrological situation of Poyang Lake	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT (WRE 2019)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				5th International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE) / 1st International Conference on Advances in Civil and Ecological Engineering Research (ACEER)	JUN 16-19, 2019	Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Macao, PEOPLES R CHINA		Macau Univ Sci & Technol			The operation of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has changed the hydrological situation of Yangtze River and its connected lakes. Based on the hydrodynamic model, the influence of TGR operation from 2009 to 2014 on the Poyang Lake has been evaluated. It is found that TGR impoundment reduced the discharge of the Yangtze River and the water level of Poyang Lake, brought the decreasing of the backflow phenomenon. Especially in October, the discharge and water level of Hukou station (HKS) decreased by 9.6% and 1.09 m respectively, and this effect could be up to the Kangshan area. Meanwhile, TGR operation has also increased the water level of HKS by 0.1 similar to 0.56 m from December to May, which only affected the vicinity of Duchang. In addition, TGR operation also increased the maximum water level of HKS from April to June by 0.1 similar to 0.34 m, and that from July to August decreased by 0.22 similar to 0.4 m which is beneficial to reducing the flood control risk of Poyang Lake. But TGR impoundment changed the water exchange process between Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, and advanced the dry season, which had a certain impact on the water supply and ecological environment of the lake area.						li, yuan/0000-0002-7636-9408													1755-1307						2019	344								012088	10.1088/1755-1315/344/1/012088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/344/1/012088													WOS:000562941100086

In this aspect, Russia has an advantageous position, having on its territory Lake Baikal, the largest storage of fresh water. UNESCO declared Lake Baikal as a World Heritage Site whose state scientists from Russia and other countries monitor and study. An analysis of the literature and the author information about the Baikal aquatic ecosystem has shown 70-year invariability of macroelement water composition of Lake Baikal and its only outflow, the Angara River. The water of Baikal and the Angara River has a constant calcium bicarbonate composition and is saturated with oxygen, 10-14 mg/l or rarely more. The average mineralization of water in Baikal and the Angara source for the study period (1950- 2018 and 1997-2018) is 95-97 (87-112) mg/l. The analysis of the 13-year (2006-2018) data on the trace element concentration in the Angara source has revealed a complex pattern of changes in concentrations of some elements. The time trends of the concentrations for the bulk of elements sometimes indicate abnormal (minimum-maximum) concentrations regardless of the season. This can be only due to "one-time or instantaneous" natural or anthropogenic changes in the Baikal environment. The Baikal tributaries indicate different chemical composition, which can be due to not only drainage of rocks with different content but also the anthropogenic impact. A simultaneous testing of water (during a month) has shown that some macro- and trace elements (F-, HCO3- and SO42-, as well as Li, Mo, B, U, Fe, etc.) have at the same time the similar concentrations in the water from Baikal, the Angara source and most tributaries.					; Kuzmin, Michail/AAH-2528-2021; Grebenshchikova, Valentina/IZQ-0352-2023	Grebenshchikova, Valentina/0000-0002-4480-7135; 													1755-1307						2019	381								012030	10.1088/1755-1315/381/1/012030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/381/1/012030													WOS:000521638100030

Solar activity expressed in a modern varve thickness sequence	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Annually laminated sediments (varves) form in particular depositional settings, e.g., where seasonal climate produces fluctuations in runoff volume; variations in runoff affect the amount and type of sediment delivered to a catchment. Prior studies confirm that variations in selected varve traits correlate with inter-annual climate signals. In some locations, solar activity also appears to be expressed in varve characteristics, either through a direct effect or indirectly via influence of solar activity on climate. Evidence from proglacial Iceberg Lake, Alaska, indicates that solar activity may have directly contributed to varve deposition. A varve thickness sequence is compared to sunspot observations from 1610-1995 CE. Maunder and Dalton minima are clearly expressed in a varve power spectrogram; varve signal amplification beginning ca. 1950s CE coincides with increasing activity evident in a sunspot spectrogram, features that are only vaguely discernible in the raw time-series plots. Spectral relationships at sunspot periodicities are consistent with direct solar forcing of varve thickness, independent of any effect solar activity might otherwise have on climate. Simulations based on a meltwater model indicate that direct forcing could result from amplified ultraviolet (UV) emission during solar maxima, combined with lower UV albedo of glacial ice. The plausible forcing mechanism bolsters epistemology for concluding a cause-effect relationship: solar variability likely contributed directly to inter-decadal patterns in Iceberg Lake varve thicknesses. The putative effect could be enhanced at higher latitudes, where Earth's atmosphere absorbs less of the UV energy emitted by the Sun; periods of lowered ozone concentration near the poles would exacerbate the natural abetting UV phenomena, potentially linking human activity to recent and accelerated polar ice cap melting.

The number of tourists on weekends and holidays usually increases significantly, which puts great pressure on traffic and scenic area management. This paper collects data from relevant toll stations and analyzes the characteristics and scale of passenger flow, making a comparative analysis of passenger flow changes, which shows that weather and holidays are the main factors affecting the passenger flow scale. Average passenger flow increase during holidays is over 75%, but during adverse weather conditions, passengers flow drops significantly, by as much as 5%-30%. Through the analysis of passenger flow distribution and its influencing factors, the traffic impact model around the scenic spot can be studied, and data support for formulating traffic organization and management measures during the peak season and holidays can be provided.

J	Micklich, N; Baranov, V; Wappler, T				Micklich, Norbert; Baranov, Viktor; Wappler, Torsten			New information on the feeding habits of the percomorph Rhenanoperca minuta, together with a short look at other fish species from the Eocene Messel Formation of Germany	BULLETIN OF GEOSCIENCES												Forage remains were studied in the digestive tracts of four Messel fish species (Rhenanoperca minuta, Thaumaturus intermedius, Cyclurus kehreri, Atractosteus messelensis). They were found in only 4% of all samples. Particular attention was paid to R. minuta. Herein, depending on the investigation method, between 0.7% and 13% of the samples contained conspecific prey fish and/or prey fish remains. In total 1.6% contained remains of amphipod shrimps. Concerning T. intermedius, prey (arthropod) remains could be found only in one sample (3.4%). Similarly, only one (6.6%) of the bowfins (C. kehreri) and none of the gars (A. messelensis) contained such remains. The pharyngeal jaws of R. minuta exhibit two basic types of dentition. One is characterized by strong, flattened ("molariform") pharyngeal teeth, and the other by more delicate and slender ("papilliform") ones. This polymorphism may be indicative of a beginning or advancing speciation. The different morphotypes probably originated in adjacent water bodies (allopatric) rather than in Lake Messel itself (sympatric). The results were discussed with particular attention to extant comparable species. The high rate of evacuated digestive tracts in R. minuta very probably results from a shortage of suitable prey, and possibly also from environmental restrictions. For the other species, different factors, like diurnal or seasonal fluctuations may have played a more important role. For R. minuta, a diet switch from predominantly arthropods to fish, especially a switch to T. intermedius as a main prey, can be discarded. Rather there appears to have been a gradual transition from soft-bodied arthropods to gastropods, as known from comparable recent species, even actual though direct evidence (gastric or intestinal contents, or even co-occurrence with abundant gastropods) could not observed among the investigated fossils.

This chapter tries to fill this gap by combining the ecosystem services (ES) and dis-services (EDS) approach suggested in 2007 by Zhang, Ricketts, Kremen, Carney, and Swinton and with agrarian system analysis and diagnosis methodology to identify ES and EDS provided by rice production systems adopted by farmers on the agro-ecosystem of Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) floodplain. Our findings show that organic rice production systems do not perform well economically or ecologically in ES provisions. In contrast, rainy-season rice, floating rice in particular, has the best performance for ES provision. This study proposes three choices to reconcile economic and ecological performance: (1) to promote production systems with medium performance for ES but low opportunity cost, promote adoption of rainy-season rice, excluding floating rice, in combination with short-term rice; (2) for medium performance for ES and medium opportunity cost, promote adoption of rainy-season rice, including floating rice, in combination with short-term rice; and (3) for high performance for ES and high opportunity cost, promote adoption of floating rice alone.

Water sampling was taken from five collection points with different inlet and outlet from other sources (lakes or drains). There were several parameters had been examined such as in-situ test (dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH value, turbidity and water transparency) and laboratory tests (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, ammonia, and chemical oxygen demand). The data collection included the rainy season began from October 2018 to December 2018. The dry season began January 2019 onward and a slight increased rainfall until March 2019. The highest Secchi Disk Transparency of 1.24 +/- 0.05 m and the lowest chlorophyll-a concentration of 23.07 +/- 2.28 mu g/L at site 2 (centre of lake) compared to the low Secchi Disk Transparency of 0.81 +/- 0.03 m and the highest chlorophyll-a concentration of 41.03 +/- 5.27 mu g/L at site 4 (cafeteria). The site 2 has a high water transparency due to less algae biomass and the absent of discharge inlet and outlet, meanwhile site 4 exposed to high discharged rate from the cafeteria causing a massive algae blooming. Total phosphorus indicated that November 2018 have the highest concentration of 95 +/- 5.7 mu g/L due to high rainfall resulted runoff to the lake. The other parameters were compared to the Water Quality Index and it proved UTAR Kampar lake was classified as Class III (moderate). Thus, UTAR Kampar lake was nutrient pollution that causes eutrophication.					guo, xinxin/JKI-1337-2023; Wong, Lai-Peng/T-5237-2017; Wong, Lai/T-5237-2017	Wong, Lai-Peng/0000-0002-9172-5183; 													0094-243X		978-0-7354-1902-5				2019	2157								020022	10.1063/1.5126557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5126557													WOS:000519957300022

Generating a supraglacial melt-lake inventory near Jakobshavn, West Greenland, using a new semi-automated lake-mapping technique	POLAR GEOGRAPHY												We analyze Landsat-7 imagery spanning a 13-year period (2000-2012) for the Jakobshavn Ablation Region (JAR) along the west coast of Greenland. In addition, we introduce a new semi-automated technique for the mapping of melt-lakes using FoveaPro image-processing software (plug-in to Adobe Photoshop (TM)), greatly simplifying the process, and resulting in more-precise spatial melt-lake statistics over existing manual methods. We found a total mean melt-lake area of 0.30 +/- 0.12 km(2) (+/- 1 sigma), with maximum melt-lake area increasing at an average rate of 0.032 km(2) d(-1 )across the study periods. Additionally, we note a yearly seasonal increase (similar to 1.8 m d(-1)) in the overall mean lake elevation (similar to 200 m per season) as well as an optimal elevation of the largest-area melt-lakes of similar to 1320 +/- 20 m (+/- 1 sigma). We also found an increase in the maximum average melt-lake elevation (MAME) of similar to 3.8 m a(-1) (similar to 50 m). Based on data recorded at nearby automated weather stations, the mean season& temperature increased similar to 1.6 degrees C over the 13-year period at an average rate of 0.125 degrees C a(-1). Although temperature is a driver for meltwater production, we conclude that mechanisms related to the surface topography are more likely modulating the spatial pattern and characteristics of melt lakes in the ablation zone.																			1088-937X	1939-0513					2019	42	2					89	108		10.1080/1088937X.2019.1578289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1088937X.2019.1578289													WOS:000469964800002

Trapa spp. are utilized by several animals, in particular the leaf beetle, Galerucella. To quantify the trophic links and material transfers between Trapa spp. and G. nipponensis, their seasonal dynamics, the amount of leaves being consumed, and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (C-13 and N-15) in Lake Inba were tracked. Trapa spp. began to increase in May, reached their highest biomass in September, and disappeared in October. G. nipponensis exhibited continuous reproduction from May until October. Grazing by G. nipponensis did not seem to affect the abundance of Trapa, as the average percentage of Trapa leaf consumed was 3%. Rather, G. nipponensis was influenced by Trapa, as C-13 and N-15 of Trapa spp. and G. nipponensis showed very similar seasonal fluctuations. The difference in N-15 was 3-4 parts per thousand, which indicates that Trapa leaves were a main food source for G. nipponensis and a trophic linkage exists between them. The estimated nitrogen and phosphorus amounts in Trapa corresponded to 1% of nitrogen and 18% of phosphorus in the entire lake. If G. nipponensis migrate and die in a terrestrial environment, G. nipponensis can transport certain nutrients from lake to terrestrial environments. The nutrients from Trapa spp. are mostly regenerated, except for that biomass transported to terrestrial ecosystems by humans.					; Kagami, Maiko/L-4430-2018	Nishihiro, Jun/0000-0002-7353-3970; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2019	20	1			SI		21	28		10.1007/s10201-018-0554-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0554-2													WOS:000457423700004

The Baikal sub-endemic species G. fasciatus is the only representative of the genus of the Baikal origin. This invader migrated from the Karelian Isthmus lakes to Lake Ladoga, Europe's largest lake, where it was reported in 1988-1990 to be inhabiting the northern and western littoral zones of the lake. Samples of crustaceans, collected in 2016, were dried and analyzed by inductively coupled mass-spectrometry (ICP MS). Mn, Sr, Zn, Cu. Pb, Cd. TI, As, V, Cr, Ni, Co, Mo and W accumulation levels in living tissues were assessed. Macro- and trace element accumulation patterns, related to the age and sex of amphipods and the time of sampling from Lake Onego, were revealed. A general sequence of all the elements analyzed is: Sr > Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cr > As > V > Pb > Co > Cd > Mo > W > Tl. It shows that the macroelements Sr. Mn, Zn and Cu are essential for small crustaceans and that the sequence results from the harmful influence of anthropogenic factors on the littoral zone of Lake Onego. Pb, Cd, Mn, V. Cr and Co concentrations in juvenile Baikal amphipods, regardless of a sampling season, markedly exceed those in adults. This is associated with the feeding ration of juvenile crustaceans dominated by detritus, which can accumulate metals. Accumulation of heavy metals in organisms of the amphipod may be associated with the presence of various industries in Petrozavodsk, automobile, railway and river transport and domestic waste, including storm sewage, discharged directly into Lake Onego.

Dynamic phase portrait: New possibilities of detecting changes in populations	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												This paper demonstrates the possibilities of detecting changes in populations of animals, based on the analysis of their dynamic phase portrait. This method allowed us to clarify the periodization of the process of naturalization of the Black Sea sprat (Clupeonella cultriventris) in the Rybinsk Reservoir and in detail describe the changes in the main dynamic characteristics of the population. On the example of zander (Sander lucioperca) in Lake Vozhe, the state was observed in which intra-population mechanisms activate which slow the increase in population (distribution of individuals from regions with high density). Use of this method allowed us to describe the new stable state of the population of grayling (Thymallus thymallus), which it entered as a result of increase in sport fishing. The data on time of presence of a population in equilibrium state allowed us to correctly unify the materials used for the analysis of changes in its age group.					; Tereshchenko, Vladimir/AAR-1457-2021; Boznak, Eduard/F-1161-2016	Tereshchenko, Vladimir/0000-0003-4170-9529; Boznak, Eduard/0000-0001-7049-1472													2310-0842	2312-301X					2019	27	4					361	366		10.15421/011948	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/011948													WOS:000505666700009

SEASONAL PATTERN OF N2O CONCENTRATIONS AND EMISSIONS IN THE SEWAGE-ENRICHED RIVERS: CASE OF CHAOHU LAKE BASIN IN SOUTHEAST CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Two sewage-enriched urban rivers within Chaohu Lake Basin in Southeast China were selected to study the seasonal variations in Nitrous Oxide (N2O) concentrations, to improve the information of N2O concentrations and emissions in the similar areas. The results indicate that N2O concentrations ranged 16.12 similar to 4043.09 nmol/L and averaged 266.27 +/- 250.28 nmol/L during the sampling period. N2O was oversaturated in both rivers ranging 184 similar to 42084% (mean 2964%). The significantly higher level of N2O concentrations and emissions were observed in cold months. It is indicated that the two rivers were net sources of atmospheric N2O. N2O emissions ranged 11.32 similar to 2920.38 mu g N-N2O/m(2)/h with an overall mean value of 743.57 +/- 831.78 mu g N-N2O/m(2)/h. A significant negative correlation exists between N2O concentration and water temperature, which may be regulated by inverse tendencies between temperature and riverine nutrient loadings. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) is a predictor of N2O in Nanfei River explaining 60% of variability in N2O; while water temperature and NO3- are better predictors of N2O in Ershibu River explaining 73% of variability in N2O. The riverine N2O may be produced by denitrification in Nanfei River while by coupled nitrification-denitrification in Ershibu River.

J	Yang, L; Li, HP; Wang, J				Yang, Le; Li, Hepeng; Wang, Jun			Spatial and Temporal Variability of Nitrous Oxide Emissions from a Large Subtropical Reservoir in Eastern China	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Carbonaceous greenhouse gases (i.e., CO2, CH4) have often reported to be emitted from the surfaces of reservoirs, while other non-carbonaceous greenhouse gases are not available to many reservoirs. In this study, the spatiotemporal variability of N2O emissions from Xin'anjiang Reservoir was investigated at the different regions over a 13-month period using the method of the static floating chambers combined with gas chromatography. Results showed that the average N2O emission flux was the highest in the downstream river (220.24 +/- 153.68 mu g m(-2).s(-1)), followed by the upstream river (49.85 +/- 48.55 mu g m(-2).s(-1)). The reservoir's main body had the lowest flux (26.61-39.07 mu g m(-2).s(-1)). Seasonal variability indicated that the average N2O emission fluxes before the dam reached their maximum in March, which was likely influenced by the disappearance of thermal stratification then, caused a short N2O flux peak at the water-air interface. A thorough investigation should be carried out at the different reservoir regions for a long-term basis to discover the spatiotemporal variability in N2O emission flux in a hydroelectric reservoir system, which could avoid the error of estimating the N2O emissions incorrectly.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2019	28	5					3497	3503		10.15244/pjoes/94409	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/94409													WOS:000469277000045
J	Yogurtçuoglu, B				Yogurtcuoglu, Baran			Simultaneous reproduction of two killifish congeners in the highly alkaline Lake Salda (Turkey)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The reproductive ecology of Western Palaearctic killifishes is poorly documented and was addressed in this study by investigating, for the first time, two closely related endemic killifish species, namely Aphanius fontinalis and Aphanius saldae. Fish samples were collected monthly from January to October 2017 to test whether the killifishes reproduce simultaneously in the highly alkaline Lake Salda (Turkey). Variation in the mean gonadosomatic index and the frequency of hydrated oocytes indicated that the two species reproduce synchronously from April to September. The timing of reproduction was affected more by day length than by water temperature. Larvae of a parasitic nematode (Eustrongylides sp.) were also observed in the gonadal tissue of some individuals. The effects of parasite infection on basic reproductive parameters were tested in A. fontinalis. Parasite infection had no significant effect on gonad weight, but was associated with significantly decreased fecundity and oocyte diameter. In both species, fecundity was related to fish size; however, the regression model showed non-significant results for the parasite-infected A. fontinalis subsamples. Further research is needed to address the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the coexistence of A. fontinalis and A. saldae and the overlap in breeding seasons.

Results indicated that soil carbon and labile carbon fractions are mainly stored in the 0 to 30 cm depth at three water conditions, and the soil carbon and labile carbon fractions sequestered in PW and SW exceeded those stored in NW. Following wetland degradation from PW to NW, water improved the sequestration of soil carbon in Swan Lake alpine wetlands. SOC content are 81.48, 98.74 and 27.48 g kg-1 at the 0 to 100 cm depth at PW, SW and NW, respectively. The DOC content is 10.32, 11.73 and 0.71 g kg-', respectively. The LOC II content is the lowest, specifically, 227.4, 75.3 and 69.1 mg kg-1 at the PW, SW and NW, respectively. In conclusion, the changeable of the period of water logging from the PW to NW in the wetlands will increase the mineralization of soil carbon and lead to a loss of soil carbon.

Samples were collected in 2017 during the monsoon season from three zones (upstream or control, middle-stream or inferred source and downstream or impacted zone) of Khli Ti creek. We found that the lead concentration of the water was the highest (0.0549 mg/l) on average in the downstream zone, and slightly exceeded the national standard level. In the sediment, the lead content was the highest (31,937.30 mg/kg) in the middle-stream zone and was approximately 25 times higher than the national standard level. The means of other selected heavy metal concentrations in the sediment were the following in descending order: Fe>Zn>As>Cd>Hg. The results also revealed lead accumulation in freshwater flora and fauna (plankton, macroinvertebrates, fish and macrophytes). Macroinvertebrates, in the middle-stream zone in particular, had the highest lead contents. Our study also showed the potential biomagnification of lead through the food chain High contents of lead in organisms may cause both acute and chronic effects on stream dwellers on which further detailed research is needed. Lastly, the consumption of freshwater organisms by the local community should be avoided to reduce any health risks.

J	Gonzalez, N; Lasso, C; Rosales, J				Gonzalez, Nirson; Lasso, Carlos; Rosales, Judith			Stability and spatio-temporal structure in fish assemblages of two floodplain lagoons of the lower Orinoco River	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												Fish assemblage structure and variability were analyzed in two floodplain lagoons (Las Arhuacas and Los Cardonales) along the lower Orinoco over a hydrological cycle. Every three months during continuous three-day sampling, experimental gill nets (5 to 12.5 cm of mesh opening) and 1 mm-mesh seine nets were utilized according to the types of habitats presents. A total of 133 fish species were found in Las Arhuacas and 95 species in Cardonales. Fifty five and 17 species were exclusive to Las Arhuacas and Los Cardonales respectively, and 77 were common to both lagoons. In Las Arhuacas, the most species-rich orders were Characiformes, Siluriformes, Perciformes and Gymnotiformes and in Los Cardonales, the most species-rich orders were Characiformes, Siluriformes, Clupeiformes and Perciformes. The richness, abundance and biomass were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in Arhuacas than in Cardonales. In general, the fishes assemblage was highly variable during the high water phase and moderately stable during low water phase in both lagoons, with more stability or less variability in Cardonales than Arhuacas. Also, there were significant differences in the fish assemblages between the two lagoons, mainly during low waters (ANOSIM; p < 0.001). The species that contributed most to the mean dissimilarity between the lagoons were Hypostomus argus, Aphanotorulus ammophilus, Potamorhina altamazonica, Prochilodus mariae, Loricaria gr. cataphracta, Oxydoras sifontesi, Hydrolycus armatus, Hyphopthalmus edentatus and Pterodoras rivasi. The last four species were more commonly collected in Los Cardonales. Also, the species of small size (mainly SL < 5 cm) such as Rhinosardinia amazonica, Moenkhausia sp. 1 "lepidura", Moenkhausia sp. 2, Aphyocharax alburnus, Characidium sp. 1, Moenkhausia sp. 3, Exodon paradoxus and Roeboides dientonito contributed to the mean dissimilarity among the beach and aquatic vegetation habitats. The patterns of the species assemblage organization were related to the dynamics of the floods. Non-random (i.e., deterministic) associations between species caused by the selection of habitats and/or to biological interactions, apparently were more common during low waters when there is an increased density of fish and so the biotic interactions are intensified. Stochastic associations, on the other hand, seemed to be more common during high water when species are more dispersed.

A total of 33 species in 29 genera were observed. Small bacterivorous ciliates, especially Cyclidium, were numerically dominant, but the greatest biomass was due to the large ciliate Condylostoma. Abundance ranged from 10.4 to 14,200 ciliates . mL(-1) (mean SE = 1,150 +/- 309 ciliates . mL(-1)) while biomass ranged from 0.017 to 500 mg C.L-1 (mean 18.2 +/- 10.8 mg C.L-1). Ciliates were generally large (mean equivalent spherical diameter 43 mum) compared to previous studies of marine or freshwater plankton. Using published maximum growth rates for the species, we calculated that ciliate production could be as much as 6.4 +/- 2.3 mg C.L-1, which is higher than previous estimates of primary production, and indicates that ciliates probably play a major role in energy flow in this system. Most of the estimated production was by large ciliates, the algivorous Frontonia (58%) and the predacious Condylostoma (33%), while the more numerous bacterivores contributed only 4%.

J	Beisner, BE				Beisner, BE			Herbivory in variable environments: an experimental test of the effects of vertical mixing and Daphnia on phytoplankton community structure	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phytoplankton communities in lakes are exposed to different within-season frequencies of heterogeneity in resource supply because of wind-induced vertical mixing. Effects of such heterogeneity, in conjunction with herbivory, on phytoplankton community structure have rarely been simultaneously examined, despite the fact that each factor can have large effects on phytoplankton composition and diversity. This study uses replicated oligotrophic mesocosms to examine the effects of herbivory and different scales of temporal heterogeneity in deepwater mixing. The pattern of vertical mixing alone had minor effects on phytoplankton community diversity and composition. The herbivore Daphnia caused a shift in phytoplankton composition to less edible types, based mainly on morphological features (spiny shapes and trichomes on cell walls) rather than size structure alone. Phytoplankton richness depended jointly on mixing frequency and large Daphnia biomasses. When systems were well mixed, with high encounter rates between predator and prey populations, phytoplankton community richness was lowest. By contrast, the systems that were least often mixed had highest richness. These results are related to limited encounter rates with infrequent mixing and to the availability of refuges from predation. Responses to different scales of temporal heterogeneity in these oligotrophic phytoplankton communities depend more on Daphnia feeding than on resource pulsing.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2001	58	7					1371	1379		10.1139/cjfas-58-7-1371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-7-1371													WOS:000169776600010
J	Townsend, SA				Townsend, SA			Perennial domination of phytoplankton by Botryococcus and Peridinium in a discontinuously polymictic reservoir (tropical Australia)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The effect of holomixis and wet season inflow on the phytoplankton composition of Darwin River Reservoir (DRR) is examined. Both phenomena constitute potential disturbances to the pelagic environment of this shallow (average depth 6 m) tropical reservoir and its phytoplankton community. Over the two year study period, the phytoplankton concentration of DRR remained much the same (0.48-2.4 mm(3)/L). At least half the biovolume comprised two species, Botryococcus braunii and Peridinium gutwinskii. These two taxa, together with other Peridinium species and desmids (predominantly Staurastrum and Cosmarium) constituted 68-98% of the reservoir's total phytoplankton biovolume. Potential disturbance by wet season inflow and 13 holomictic events had minimal affect on the domination of the Botryococcus-Peridinium-Desmidaceae assemblage, owing mainly to their short duration (4-5 days) and minor influence on light intensities in the mixed layer. Some holomictic events, however, favoured the growth of the diatom Aulacoseira granulata which reached a maximum of 17 % of the reservoir's total phytoplankton biovolume. Fast growing, small r-selected phytoplankton, which are favoured by nutrient rich waters, constituted a minor component (<1 % total biovolume) of the reservoir's phytoplankton, probably owing to the phosphorus impoverishment of the mixed layer. B. braunii colonies and P. gutwinskii have many characteristics of K-selected (slow growing) S-species, which mark the later stages of autogenic succession. There was no evidence of phytoplankton autogenic succession with the onset of thermal stratification in DRR. The perennial domination of the reservoir's phytoplankton by a single assemblage, and notably by two species, suggests the reservoir's phytoplankton community is in dynamic equilibrium (or steady-state) with the environment, supporting the contention that climax communities are self-sustaining.																			0003-9136					JUL	2001	151	4					529	548																WOS:000170655500001
J	Martin, C; Frenette, JJ; Morin, J				Martin, C; Frenette, JJ; Morin, J			Changes in the spectral and chemical properties of a water mass passing through extensive macrophyte beds in a large fluvial lake (Lake Saint-Pierre, Quebec, Canada)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Large fluvial lakes, as part of river corridors, are recognized as spatially heterogeneous ecosystems. Due to their shallowness, the littoral zone of these lakes occupies a large proportion of their surface and is extensively covered by macrophytes that are known to affect their physical, chemical and biological environments in various ways. This study documents the small-scale (5 km) bio-optical variations associated with the longitudinal passage of a water mass through macrophyte beds during their maximal growth season. The utilization of a 2D hydrodynamic model allowed us to establish hydrological connectivity between stations within the beds, and thus to identify longitudinal heterogeneity along the macrophyte beds. Significant changes in the inherent properties of the water were observed along the upstream-downstream gradient. Due to their effects on hydrodynamics, macrophytes were responsible for a decrease in particles and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) resulting in an increasing penetration depth of ultraviolet (UV) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Along the transect, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) decreased more rapidly than DOC resulting in a decrease of the CDOM to DOC ratio. The observed changes in the DOC pool may be explained by the constant input of non-chromophoric DOC from macrophyte leachates and exudation within the bed and/or the photochemical and microbial degradation of CDOM. The implication of such small-scale heterogeneity on Lake Saint-Pierre productivity is discussed.

J	Bailey, KM; Bedford, BL				Bailey, KM; Bedford, BL			Transient geomorphic control of water table and hydraulic head reversals in a coastal freshwater peatland	WETLANDS												We studied a Great Lakes peatland protected by a barrier dune system to test the hypothesis that changes in the morphology of a barrier beach alter the wetland surface-water and ground-water hydrology such that the plant rooting zone in the wetland interior might be affected. Hydraulic head measured in observation wells located on transects perpendicular to a flow-through channel, uplands, and Lake Ontario were compared to lake-level changes, weather patterns, and the temporal conditions of the barrier beach. Water-table elevations within the wetland complex always remained 0.35 to 0.84 m above Lake Ontario's water level (mean difference = 0.62 m) and did not fluctuate in parallel with changes in the lake's water level. Flooding events occurred when breaches closed and isolated the wetland complex from Lake Ontario; daily average water levels rose between 0.06 m and 0.27 m. When the barrier beach was breached naturally or by human activity, daily average water-table elevations in the wetland receded between 0.16 m and 0.41 m. During the growing season, vertical ground-water-flow directions also changed as a function of changing hydraulics controlled by the barrier beach. Vertical recharge-discharge gradients ranged from -0.2 to 0.1 m.m(-1). Water-table elevation and hydraulic head gradients across the study area were controlled primarily by short-term (days to weeks) changes in shoreline geomorphology, whereas seasonal weather patterns and Lake Ontario water-level fluctuations imposed secondary controls on the ground-water-flow regime.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2003	23	4					969	978		10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0969:TGCOWT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0969:TGCOWT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000188326200025
J	Lendvay, JM; Dean, SM; Adriaens, P				Lendvay, JM; Dean, SM; Adriaens, P			Temporal and spatial trends in biogeochemical conditions at a groundwater-surface water interface: Implications for natural bioattenuation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The biogeochemical effects of a large surface water on a contaminated anaerobic groundwater at the groundwater-surface water interface (GSI) were evaluated using spatially discretized multilevel arrays and interpreted in light of natural bioattenuation mechanisms. Groundwater samples, collected during a 5-month evaluation period with increasing storm activity, were evaluated to determine the effect of lake activity on the oxidation capacity and contaminant distribution within the plume. Our analyses indicate that concentrations of methane and chloroethene decreased as the groundwater became increasingly oxidized along the GSI in shallow sample points impacted by infiltration of oxygenated lake water. cis-1,2-Dichloroethene remained unchanged or slightly increased at the same locations, indicating that the decrease in methane and chloroethene was not due to dilution effects. Moreover, negative correlation of chloroethene and methane data with oxygen suggest that chloroethene is co-oxidized by methane-oxidizing bacteria in the shallow zone of the plume. Contrary to oxidative processes in the shallow zone, reductive dechlorination of contaminants remained the predominant bio-transformation process in the deep zones of the GSI with chloroethene and ethene being the major contributors to total contaminant concentration. This study is the first to evaluate the effects of seasonal changes on a chlorinated ethene-contaminated plume at the GSI in spatial and temporal detail.

Vander			The Reproduction and Ecology of Hypericum edisonianum: An Endangered Florida Endemic	CASTANEA												The reproduction and ecology of the narrow endemic and Florida endangered shrub Hypericum edisonianum (Edison's St. John's Wort) was investigated through field and greenhouse studies. Hypericum edisonianum, exhibits a number of traits common to rare and geographically limited plant species including heavy reliance on clonal propagation to maintain local stands, passive seed dispersal resulting in a near-parent seed shadow, limited numbers of genetically unique individuals in its isolated seasonal-pond habitat, and likely self-incompatibility. In the field study, most flowers were produced by a small subset of the monitored ramets. Indeed, three ramets belonging to a single genetic individual accounted for 26% of all seed output from the 78 ramets monitored over a one-year period. In spite of strong seed production and germination, seedling establishment appears to occur episodically. The implication is that H. edisonianum is poorly equipped to withstand landscape drainage, agricultural and human development, and climate change. Such impacts will severely challenge the persistence of not only H. edisonianum but also many of the associated species inhabiting Florida scrub. Detailed information is needed about the population-genetic structure of H. edisonianum populations in order to understand its metapopulation structure. Protection of existing and potential H. edisonianum stands is crucial to the long-term preservation this species.																			0008-7475	1938-4386				SEP	2014	79	3					168	181		10.2179/14-016	http://dx.doi.org/10.2179/14-016													WOS:000344308700006

However, coagulation-flocculation and sedimentation only are not sufficient in modern practices as nowadays every process is being viewed through an economic point of view. The present work aims to study the impact of pre-sedimentation on optimum coagulant dosage of raw water taken from a lake located at Tezpur University. Alum was used with the aim of determining its optimum doses at optimum pH and alkalinity. The influence of seasonal variation of pH and alkalinity on the coagulation dosages was studied and conditions were optimized corresponding to the best removal of turbidity. For raw and settled water the optimum alum dose obtained was 35-40 and 25-30 mg/L, respectively, clearly showing the impact of pre-sedimentation on optimization of alum dose and thereby economizing the water treatment process. Results indicated up to 98.67% removal of turbidity of water sample which had undergone pre-sedimentation process. A correlation has been developed between overall suspended solids removal and overall turbidity removal which can help in quickly estimating overall suspended solids removal using turbidity data.

The temporal and spatial distributions were investigated by using two types of ultrasonic telemetry system, active tracking and passive monitoring. Biwa salmon cruised throughout the north basin horizontally and were distributed from the surface to the bottom vertically in the lake. An individual monitored for over 1 year showed the diurnal patterns of vertical distribution and the seasonal patterns of horizontal distribution. The vertical distribution of the fish during daytime in the stratified period was bimodal, suggesting a feeding strategy targeting both fish near the thermocline and the amphipods near the bottom. During the night, however, the fish maintained a fixed depth range. The fish were distributed over a wider horizontal area in the mixed period than in the stratified period. Three individuals swam in shallower water and experienced higher water temperatures during the spawning season than before moving between offshore and coastal areas.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				SEP	2014	80	5					951	961		10.1007/s12562-014-0772-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-014-0772-4													WOS:000342220700010

Chemical Composition Characteristics of Water and Phytoplankton Development in Lake Zavernyaikha	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Based on long-term observations, we examine the seasonal and interannual dynamics of the phytoplankton and chemical composition of the water in Lake Zavernyaikha located in the delta of the Selenga river. The study revealed an intense development of five kinds of phytoplankton under the ice, dominated by dynophytes: Baikal's endemics G. baicalense and P. baicalense. The main factors for massive algae development under the ice are: the favorable gaseous regime and relationship of nutrients, high content of readily hydrolizable organic matter (RHOM), isolatedness of the water body, and high division rate of dinophytes.

Season length influences breeding range dynamics of trumpeter swans Cygnus buccinator	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												The breeding range of large-bodied waterfowl nesting in the northern boreal forest is likely influenced by breeding season length. This may be particularly true for the largest species of North American waterfowl, the trumpeter swan Cygnus buccinator, due to the extended time period necessary to raise young to fledging. This species recently recovered from near-extinction in the early 1900s to reoccupy historic breeding areas throughout the boreal forest in Alaska, although recolonization patterns may have been influenced by variation in season length over the same time period. This may have resulted in range expansion into areas that were historically unavailable due to an ice-free period insufficient for successful reproduction. We used hierarchical occupancy models to analyze trumpeter swan survey data collected over the entire breeding range in Alaska during 1968-2005. We fit models containing combinations of recolonization parameters, trend and latitude, and season length to these data to determine whether these variables explained the variation in occupancy across our survey area. Support for season length parameters would provide evidence that the recolonization process was partially related to the length of the breeding season. We expected that occupancy probability would increase range-wide due to overall population growth, while occupancy would be greatest at mid-latitudes, near the center of the species range. Because this population was recovering, we also expected that expansion would proceed outward from the range center. Our results indicated that habitat occupancy was positively related to season length, partially explaining the recently observed northward range expansion. Our results suggest that increases in annual temperatures due to climate warming would likely be associated with further range expansion in trumpeter swans and may have implications for other wetland obligates. Changes in species distributions will likely increase competition for breeding areas with potential negative effects on species not limited by season length. This may already be occurring in Alaska where the breeding distribution of trumpeter swans has begun to overlap with that of tundra swans Cygnus columbianus.

A new species of dinoflagellates, Cleistosphaeridium lacustre, is described from Upper Oligocene sediments of palaeo-lake Enspel. They are associated with other phytoplankton, such as diatoms, chrysophytes, green algae and benthic cyanobacteria. Mass occurrences of this species are interpreted as algal blooms and may partly reflect seasonal successions. This phenomenon was controlled by volcanic activities in the depositional area, which led to an increase in nutrient supply. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Denitrification rate was calculated from the total N(2) flux out of the sediment taking into account the correction for the released N(2) flux because of the changes in nitrogen solubility. Nitrogen, the final product of denitrification, was measured directly by gas chromatography. N(2)O, the intermediate product of denitrification, was not observed. Denitrification rates for all the investigated lakes ranged from about 25 to 1100 mu mol N(2) m(-2) h(-1) and resembled the values reported for eutrophic reservoirs. Denitrification rates at the upper Rzeszow reservoir stations were generally higher than at the lower ones. Spatial variations in denitrification rates were also observed between stations for Solina and Besko reservoirs. The rates of denitrification for Wilcza Wola reservoir were found to be very low, probably because of compact sediment structure and low substrate availability. Denitrification rate was enhanced under natural light conditions. Temporal variations in denitrification rates appeared to be dominated by temperature. The results suggest that denitrification is an important sink for nitrogen and that environmental conditions such as temperature, light, and available substrate affect denitrification rates. The results presented in this paper indicate that the in situ chamber method should be a useful tool in the studies of denitrification in an aquatic environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Twenty-one lakes of western Niger with good ground observation records were selected for examination. Thematic Mapper images from 1988 were first analysed to determine surface areas and temperature differences between water and adjacent land. Six AVHRR scenes from the 1988-89 dry season were then studied. It was found that a lake can be monitored until its surface area drops below 10 ha, in most cases. Furthermore, with prior knowledge of the location and shape of a water body, its surface area can be estimated from AVHRR band 5 data to within about 10 ha. These results are explained by the sharp temperature contrast between water and land, on the order of 13 degrees C.																			0143-1161					MAR 10	1996	17	4					733	748		10.1080/01431169608949041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431169608949041													WOS:A1996UC01200007

Most Idaho wine grape vineyards are located in the Western Snake River Plain (WSRP) rift basin (similar to 43 degrees N, similar to 117 degrees W) on soils derived from lake, river, volcanic and wind-blown sediments. The underlying Tertiary and Quaternary rocks record the geologic history of ancient Lake Idaho, its interaction with basaltic volcanism, and sub-sequent Pleistocene fluvial processes and catastrophic floods. The and to semi-arid, mid-latitude steppe climate of the WSRP provides fewer growing degree days than American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) in Walla Walla, Washington and Napa Valley, California, but still allows cultivation of Vitis vinifera grapes. Other differences include lower precipitation, higher solar radiation during the growing season, and greater threat of cold injury. Wine grapes grown in the WSRP require irrigation, and irrigation is used to manage canopy size and manipulate vine physiology. Wine grape acreage in Idaho has increased dramatically since 1993 and is estimated, in 2003, at about 500 ha with the white wine cultivars Riesling, Chardonnay, and Gewurztraminer comprising about 60% of production, and Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah as principal red wine cultivars.

J	Dgebuadze, YY; Mina, MV; Alekseyev, SS; Golubtsov, AS				Dgebuadze, YY; Mina, MV; Alekseyev, SS; Golubtsov, AS			Observations on reproduction of the Lake Tana barbs	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												During the rainy season (September-November 1994), in tributaries of Lake Tana (Ethiopia), the Gumara, Gelda and Negashu, barbs of different morphotypes were ready to spawn, running and spent. The most numerous were barbs similar to Barbus intermedius common in many rivers of the Ethiopian Highlands. They were also found spawning in the Gumara and Gelda Rivers in the dry season (February 1996, 1997). There were no evident differences in time and place of spawning of barbs representing different morphotypes. Only zurki, bigmouth mini-eye and bighead were not found in the rivers. Spatial and temporal segregation may contribute to reproductive isolation of morphotypes spawning in rivers, but if reproductive isolation exists the main role must be played by differences in mating behaviour. Morphotypes of the Lake Tana barbs have different migration patterns. Barbs similar to the riverine B. intermedius may spend their lives in rivers or in the lake, moving to and fro. Barbs of acute, bigmouth big-eye and, perhaps, other morphotypes migrate downstream as alevins or fry, stay in the lake for several years and migrate back into rivers for spawning after reaching maturity.

The NOM samples were similar with respect to proton and copper binding, although minor differences were observed among the samples of different origin. Slight variations occurred for seasonal changes and lime additions. The proton binding pK(a) values grouped in three distinct classes: pK(a)1 = 4.20-4.28; pK(a)2 = 6.61-6.87; and pK(a)3 = 9.27-9.8. The average total proton binding site concentration of the NOM samples was: 12.7 meq/g total organic carbon (TOC). Two binding sites were established for copper with average log K1 = 4.84 and log K2 = 7.17. The average site concentration for samples isolated by reverse osmosis (RO) was 0.56 mu mol/mg C. Copper binding characteristics appear to be influenced by the method of sample isolation. For NOM isolated by low pressure evaporation (evap), binding site concentrations are smaller, conditional stability constants are higher, variability of the copper complexation capacity is smaller, and correlation with elemental composition (C, N, H) is better than in the case of NOM isolated by RO.

Post-emergent age-0 lake trout were captured on rocky spawning substrate with a 3-m beam trawl and at the nursery area with a bottom trawl from June to September 1990 and June to August 1991. Catch data suggested that age-0 lake trout move distances of 7-11 km to the nursery area over a 3-month period. Water currents, measured at Gull Island Shoal, may be a part of the transport mechanism. Examination of daily-growth increments on the sagittae and back-calculation from the date of capture revealed that most fish hatched between 6 June and 19 July in 1990 and between 30 April and 30 May in 1991. The duration of the hatch was 100 days in 1990 and 120 days in 1991, and the estimated incubation period is about 7 months for lake trout eggs at this site. Similar hatch-date distributions of age-0 captured on different sampling dates suggested that natural mortality was low.																			0380-1330						1995	21			1			233	245		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71096-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71096-6													WOS:A1995UL89400019
J	BERG, DJ; GARTON, DW				BERG, DJ; GARTON, DW			GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION IN NORTH-AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN POPULATIONS OF THE CLADOCERAN BYTHOTREPHES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bythotrephes cederstroemi, a Palearctic cladoceran (Crustacea) zooplankter, has recently invaded all of the Laurentian Great Lakes. We used cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis to examine the genetic structure of these newly founded populations and to compare it to the structure of established European populations of B. cederstroemi and a congener, Bythotrephes longimanus. All populations of Bythotrephes had low intrapopulation genetic variation, with 1-12 multiple-locus genotypes per population. Genotype frequencies were often different from Hardy-Weinberg expectations for North American populations, primarily due to heterozygote excesses. Interpopulation variation was low within drainage basins but high among basins. Great Lakes populations were most similar to Finnish populations, while Swedish and German populations formed a separate group. North American populations appear to have been founded from a single European population, probably located in the northeastern Baltic region. Sympatric populations of B. cederstroemi and B. longimanus showed a greater degree of similarity than allopatric conspecifics, leading to the conclusion that these may represent morphologically distinct forms of a single species. Our results indicate that, as with other cladoceran species, restricted gene flow and founder events may be important in determining patterns of geographic variation among populations of Bythotrephes. Genetic variation among populations within drainage basins was lower than across basins, regardless of geographic distance between sites. Thus, river basins act as pathways of dispersal, leading to significant migration between populations within a basin but little migration between basins.					; Berg, David/GQQ-2457-2022	Berg, David/0000-0002-2537-0759; 													0024-3590					NOV	1994	39	7					1503	1516		10.4319/lo.1994.39.7.1503	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1994.39.7.1503													WOS:A1994PZ96700001

Some exposures of the swamp facies contain significant fossil forests represented by autochthonous assemblages of mummified in-situ tree stumps and forest-floor leaf-litter mats. Exposed trunks within a single coal layer represent multiple stands of trees killed and buried at the different times over 500-2000 yr. Stratigraphic examination of peat and coal megafossil floristics of the ''level N'' fossil forest at the centimetre-scale demonstrates small-scale changes in forest composition and swamp hydrology horizontally, and temporal variation vertically within this layer. A mosaic of taxodiaceous swamp (Metasequoia dominant with or without Glyptostrobus), a mixed coniferous community, and Alnus/fern bog appears to have produced both the leaf mats and the in-situ stumps, with the taxodiaceous swamp the dominant peat-accumulating phase. Taxodiaceous layers are interpreted as areas of standing water which may have experienced seasonal water-level fluctuations. Alnus/fern (with or without other broadleaved angiosperms) communities reflect areas of slightly higher peat and hence locally lower water tables, but may also reflect successional processes. The areal extent and position of these different hydrologically-controlled plant communities appears to have changed throughout the interval of accumulation of the peat layer examined.

A Water Balance Budget for Bung Boraphet-A Flood Plain Wetland-Reservoir Complex in Thailand	WATER												A water balance model was developed for Bung Boraphet reservoir, a large flood plain lake in Thailand, from daily measurements over three inflow outflow cycles between 2003 and 2006. Measurement error was 10% (as one standard deviation) of the total measured volume. The specific yield from the Bung Boraphet catchment was 3.9 m(3)/ha/yr and surface water inflow from the local catchment was the largest gain term and evaporation was the largest loss term in the water budget. Irrigation was the second largest loss term and dry season demand exceeded the storage supply. Uncontrolled extraction of water for irrigation is regarded as a threat to the reservoir fishery, although the increasing drawdown range may benefit wetland biodiversity. Sustainable management of the Bung Boraphet wetland will depend on careful management based on an informed understanding of the eco-hydrological requirements of all wetland uses. Water balance models like this one are recommended as a tool to allocate water equitably and in ways which can be integrated across the Chao Phraya basin.																			2073-4441					DEC	2009	1	1					54	79		10.3390/w1010054	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w1010054													WOS:000208555400007

I-129 concentrations in the lakes ranged from 2.1 to 15.0 x 10(8) atoms per liter and did not show elevated concentration in lakes located in regions of high Chernobyl fallout. Apparently, the studied region is strongly influenced by I-129 releases from the reprocessing facilities through precipitation. Desorption or resuspension of I-129 from soils and sediments does not seem to be an active process to increase the concentration of I-129 in the lakes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A squared-Mahalanobis distance-based classification scheme was then used to classify 320 MERIS data between 2003 and 2012 (similar to 2.7 images/month on average). Significant dynamics of the probability of occurrence (POO) for different classes were observed through long-term analysis. The extremely turbid and clear water classes dominated Poyang Lake, accounting for similar to 70% of the total surface area within the entire time series. Class III and IV waters showed out-of-phase fluctuation patterns, while a large POO was observed in dry seasons for the extremely turbid water class (Class III), and the clear water class (Class IV) represented most of the lake in the wet seasons. The northern narrow water channel of Poyang Lake was generally characterized by Class II and III waters. In contrast, the high POO of Class IV was demonstrated in the southern main lake and some eastern and southern isolated sublakes. The hydrological analysis shows that the south-to-north water level gradients were positively correlated with the combined POOs of Classes II and III (R-2 = 0.4) and that the gradients were negatively correlated with the POO of Class IV (R-2 = 0.36). Significant relationships existed between the POOs of different classes and local precipitation. This study provides critical information for future environmental conservation planning.

EXPLORING LITERARY JOURNALISM AND THE TRUTH IN WINE	BRAZILIAN JOURNALISM RESEARCH												Writers of narrative literary journalism are not often aware of the reasons why they write the way they do, and they usually leave critical theory outside the door of their writing space. In this essay, a writer and scholar examines critical reasons why he made choices he did as author of the award-winning book Seasons of a Finger Lakes Winery. The essay has two parts. The first part explores how narrative literary Journalism attempts to narrow the distance between the subjectivities of author, reader and protagonists when compared to more conventional models of "objective" journalism. The result is hopefully a heightened degree of psychological transport on the part of the reader because of an increased cognitive response to the perception that the account is about phenomenal actuality, and the influence of the mirror neuron in mimicking that actuality. The second part exams narrative efforts in Seasons of a Finger Lakes Winery to reveal the mystique behind wine, including its science, art, and what the author describes as mystification resulting from the metaphorical "bullshit" created by the wine snob.																			1808-4079	1981-9854				DEC	2018	14	3					654	675		10.25200/BJR.v14n3.2018.1152	http://dx.doi.org/10.25200/BJR.v14n3.2018.1152													WOS:000454509300004

We evaluated the response of phytoplankton functional groups in samples from two subtropical rivers, identifying the main environmental filters associated with the presence of the different groups and their functional traits during a seasonal cycle. Using multivariate analysis, we found environmental dissimilarity that was predicted by the presence of different functional groups (FGs) in the two rivers. Six FGs were recorded: J (chlorophyceans chlorococcales), M (colonial cyanobacteria), N (desmids), W1 (euglenophyceans), X2 (flagellated unicellular chlorophyceans) and F (flagellated colonial chlorophyceans). The FGs J, M and N were exclusive to Cascavel River, while X2 and F were exclusive to Quati River. The FG W1 was recorded in both rivers; however, its greatest contribution was in Quati River. Thus, the FGs reflected the environmental dissimilarity, mainly related to the conditions of water flux, conductivity, light availability and depth of the environments. Based on these results, the functional groups are considered to provide a relevant tool in phytoplankton ecology, offering a practical means of investigating the relationship between phytoplankton and ecosystem functioning, and contributing to the management and conservation of biodiversity in lotic environments.

Epidemiological profile of drowning deaths: a cross sectional study	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES												Background: World Health Organization described, drowning as serious and neglected public health problem. Near about 42 people every hour and 3.7 lakh every year die from drowning in the world. In India out of total cases of unnatural deaths 9.4% were died due to drowning, this was the second most common after road traffic accidents. Method: The present study was undertaken at tertiary care hospital government medical college and hospital located in central India on dead bodies brought for postmortem. The study was carried out during the period of December 2013 to November 2015 on 176 cases, to study the various epidemiological parameters of drowning. Result and conclusions: We have concluded that 72.02% victims were male and 28.98% were female, with ratio 2.45: 1, drowning deaths were most commonly seen in age groups of 21-30 years (27.84%). Married population constitutes 46.59% and remaining 32.95% were unmarried. Maximum number of drowning deaths had occurred in urban region constituting 57.38% cases followed by rural region constituting 42.62% cases. Students were the victim seen in 18.75% cases, Hindu community contributed to maximum number of cases with 60.23% cases, number of victims of drowning deaths belong to upper-lower class with 35.23% cases. In drowning deaths 21.02% of victims had familial and financial problems and depression in 20.45% cases, chronic alcoholism in 18.18% cases. The number of drowning deaths occurred in rainy season was (43.75%).

The ISDDSS is based on comprehensive analyses of the previous flooding events in China, especially the one that occurred in the Yangtze River Basin in 1998. A large number of conditions including the hydrological features and the economic losses resulting from flooding disasters are addressed. Due to the frequent floods in the Yangtze River Basin, the management of flood-endangered regions in the middle stream area has become one of the most important water-related issues in China. This is mainly because of such factors as the regions' high population density, flat alluvial plain, far-flung farmlands, and strong economic potentials. The flood-endangered regions are greatly vulnerable to flooding in rainy season due to the flat terrain and their direct connections with surface rivers and lakes. Moreover, they were often chosen to retain floodwater in order to protect major cities in the Yangtze River Basin. The ISDDSS is proposed to prevent flooding disasters, to minimize flood damages, and to promote sustainable development in such regions.

J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV			Empirical and dynamical models of production and biomass of benthic algae in lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This work presents new empirical and dynamical models for benthic algae in lakes. The models were developed within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which also accounts for phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), macrophytes, prey fish and predatory fish. The new dynamic model provides seasonal variations (the calculation time is 1 week). It is meant to account for all factors regulating the production and biomass of benthic algae for lakes in general. This work also presents and uses a new data-base established by us from published sources. Many of the lakes included in this study are situated in the former Soviet Union. They were investigated during the Soviet period and the data and results have up until now been largely unknown in the West. We present empirical models for benthic algae, and show that the biomass of benthic algae in whole lakes can be estimated from the ratio between the lake area above the Secchi depth to the total lake area and the primary production of phytoplankton. We also present several critical tests of the dynamical model. The dynamical and empirical models give corresponding results over a wide limnological domain. We provide algorithms for (1) the production rate of benthic algae (2) the elimination rate (related to the turnover time of benthic algae), (3) the rate of benthic algae consumption by zoobenthos, and (4) the rate of physical erosion of benthic algae. Our results indicate that the production of benthic algae is highly dependent on lake morphometry and sediment character, as well as water clarity, and less dependent on nutrient (phosphorus) concentrations in water and sediments. This work provides new quantitative support to such conclusions and also a useful model for predictions of production and biomass of benthic algae.

We compared molecular genetic markers of silver carp among populations of the Changjiang River, the Ganjiang River and the Poyang Lake using the ND5/6 region of mtDNA. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of this region revealed distinct variation between the Ganjiang River and the Changjiang River populations. The Poyang Lake is linked with the Ganjiang River and the Changjiang River. Shared RFLP fragments between the Ganjiang River population and the Poyang Lake population are as high as 61.4%. The value is 47.74% between the populations of the Changjiang River and that of the Poyang Lake. Frequencies of bands peculiar to the Ganjiang River population are the same as in the Poyang Lake population. We conclude that the Poyang Lake silver carp population consists mainly of the Ganjiang River population. The water level of the Poyang Lake outlet, which is higher than that of the Changjiang River in the silver carp spawning season, supports this conclusion.

J	Kohler, J				Kohler, J			Measurement of in situ growth rates of phytoplankton under conditions of simulated turbulence	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In situ measurement of the growth rates of planktonic populations can be improved by using dialysis chambers ('cage cultures') to avoid shifts in the chemical environment during incubation. Vertical mixing and small-scale turbulence affect the growth of planktonic populations, therefore natural mixing conditions should be simulated as closely as possible during the incubation. A new device is described here which combines the advantages of a dialysis chamber with a programmable vertical mixing regime. Realistic phytoplankton growth rates can thus be measured in situ under conditions of vertical mixing and small-scale turbulence. The chamber made of transparent, UV-transmitting acrylic glass was fitted at both ends with permeable polycarbonate membranes. It was moved vertically through the water column by a pocket sized lift and rotated simultaneously on its central axis. The method was applied to two types of experiments on growth and losses of phytoplankton in the River Severn, UK. The first one compared changes in biovolume of phytoplankton in a water parcel flowing downstream (6% h(-1) decline) with those in a simultaneously incubated dialysis chamber moved between water surface and river bottom (7% h(-1) increase). The difference equates to algal losses prevented in the chamber but suffered along the river (mainly sedimentation and grazing of benthic filter feeders). Loss rate of diatoms was three times higher than those of chlorophytes. In another experiment growth of phytoplankton from the main stream and lateral dead zone was compared under different mixing conditions. Algae from the main stream grew faster than from the dead zone. Only cryptophytes preferred calm conditions, all the other algal groups grew faster in chambers moved through the water column than in stationary ones. Further possible applications in both standing and flowing waters are discussed.

Conochilus colonies increase in size throughout the season from May to August and then disappear from the lake. Simultaneously, Parabroteas developed from CI to CV and adults. We observed that when the predaceous copepod begins to prey on Conochilus, colony size increases in relation to maxilliped length of the predator. Our results show that the increasing size of the colony of Conochilus is an effective defense against Parabroteas predation.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Dieguez, Maria/0000-0002-8241-3719; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; 													0018-8158						1998	387						421	425		10.1023/A:1017042610913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017042610913													WOS:000080234300056

Daily methane flux was positively correlated (r = 0.95) with daily leaf conductance at three lake margin sites over an 8-day period. Furthermore, methane flux was reduced significantly following stomatal closure induced by application of an antitranspirant to the plant surface and by enclosure in an opaque chamber. These are the first data to show evidence of stomatal control of release of methane from plants. Significant methane flux continued, however, even with stomatal closure, suggesting that cuticular conductance remains an important mechanism of methane release. The importance of stomatal pathway, relative to the cuticular pathway, is expected to vary through the growing season. These results have significant implications both in the design of chamber-based measurement studies and in interpreting regional to global methane emissions from wetlands.																			0045-6535	1879-1298				JAN-FEB	1993	26	1-4					339	355		10.1016/0045-6535(93)90430-D	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(93)90430-D													WOS:A1993KM22500024
J	Smith, MA; Hollander, DJ				Smith, MA; Hollander, DJ			Historical linkage between atmospheric circulation patterns and the oxygen isotopic record of sedimentary carbonates from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA	GEOLOGY												Stratigraphic variations in the delta(18)O values of sedimentary carbonate in Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) correlate with changes in atmospheric circulation patterns over the past century Carbonate delta(18)O values trend toward O-18 depletion in progressively younger sediments. Archives of historical water-column data and climate data from the surrounding drainage basin indicate that this trend cannot reflect changes in water temperature, timing of carbonate precipitation, disequilibrium isotope fractionation? air temperature, or seasonal precipitation patterns. However, significant correlations with the frequency and direction of cyclones indicate that the isotopic record has been significantly influenced by subtle changes in atmospheric circulation ol er the past 100 yr. Two atmospheric circulation models can account for this relationship: (1) greater contributions of O-18-depleted precipitation associated with air masses from the Pacific Ocean or (2) a progressive increase in the altitude of condensation leading to O-18 depletion of precipitation originating from the Gulf of Mexico. Because the Pacific Ocean generally contributes little moisture to the Midcontinent, the first model is an unlikely mechanism to generate the isotopic trends observed in the sediments, Intrusions of dry, dense air from the west, however, could force moisture originating from the Gulf of Mexico to higher altitudes of condensation and thus account for the trends in the carbonate isotopic record. This study demonstrates that historic data used in conjunction with lacustrine delta(18)O stratigraphy provide a method to reconstruct past atmospheric circulation regimes in continental environments. Comparisons of sedimentary isotopic records from lakes in North America and Europe indicate that these reconstructions of regional atmospheric circulation patterns can be integrated to assess circulation changes on the global scale.																			0091-7613					JUL	1999	27	7					589	592		10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027<0589:HLBACP>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027<0589:HLBACP>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000081167900003

The planktonic bacterial assemblages in the lake consisted of various RQ subgroups with different growth and mortality rates. The sum of total bacterial mortalities due to protistan grazing and viral lysis accounted for 96.6 % (range 89.0-107.2 %) of daily total bacterial production. This is the first report that successfully demonstrates a balanced relationship between bacterial production and losses using the modified dilution method in a lake. The growth rates of ubiquinone (UQ)-containing bacteria were faster than those of menaquinone-containing bacteria. Especially the dominant and fastest growing bacterial groups in the present study were the bacterial groups containing UQ-8 or UQ-10. The sum of their production and loss accounted for 60 % of carbon fluxes within the microbial loop. Thus, a large portion of the carbon cycling through the bacterial community in Lake Biwa can be explained by the carbon fluxes through dominant bacterial groups.					; Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016	Kunihiro, Tadao/0000-0001-6484-9386; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2014	15	3					257	270		10.1007/s10201-014-0431-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-014-0431-6													WOS:000340521100007

The physical model captures the behaviour of real thermal stratification in the lake for different flow situations during the period 1993-1997. The dissolved organic carbon model is based on simulated trajectories of water parcels. By tracking parcels, account is kept of environmental factors such as temperature and radiation as well as DOC quality for each parcel, The DOC concentration shows seasonal variations primarily dependent on inflow. The organic matter degradation (bacterial- and photodegradation) in the lake amounts to 1.5-2.5 mg C l(-1) yr(-1), where photooxidation is responsible for approximately 10%. The estimated DIC production in the lake is large compared to sediment mineralisation and primary production. The main conclusion is that the model with the selected parameterisations of the degradation processes reasonably well describes the DOC dynamics in a forest lake.																			1420-2026						2001	6	3					159	172		10.1023/A:1011953730983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011953730983													WOS:000172030000002

These values were compared with the N and P concentration in sediments and macrophyte biomass in order to assess nutrient availability, fate and storage capacity. High variability was found in the interstitital water using a 1 cm resolution device. Nitrate was never detected in the pore water. Depth averaged NH4+ concentrations in the upper 30 cm layer often ranged from N = 1.5 to 1.8 mg l(-1), but showed a pronounced minimum (0.5-0.7 mg l(-1)), close to (March 95), or relatively soon after (May 94) the end of the macrophyte growing season. Soluble phosphate showed a large variation between P = 0.1-1.1 mg l(-1) without any discernible seasonal pattern. NH4+ depletion in the pore water concentration and low N/P ratios (3.7 by weight) within the macrophyte biomass at the end of the growing period suggest that available N limits plant growth. NH4+ and o-P concentrations were 35 and 7 times higher, respectively, in the pore water than in the overlying marsh, suggesting a permanent flux of nutrients from the sediments. o-P accumulate in the marsh leading to higher concentrations than in the incoming river. NH4+ did not accumulate in the marsh, and no significant differences were observed between the river and the marsh water, while the NO3- contributed by the river water was depleted within the marsh, caused probably by coupled nitrification-denitrification at the sediment-water interface. Although an order of magnitude smaller, the pore water pool can supply enough nutrients to build up the macrophyte biomass pool, but only if a fast turnover is attained. The Parana floodplain marsh retains a large amount of nutrients being stored mainly in the sediment compartment.																			0018-8158						1999	392	1					65	71		10.1023/A:1003505424569	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003505424569													WOS:000081003700007
J	MADENJIAN, CP; GABREY, SW				MADENJIAN, CP; GABREY, SW			WATERBIRD PREDATION ON FISH IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE - A BIOENERGETICS MODEL APPLICATION	CONDOR												To better understand the role of piscivorous waterbirds in the food web of western Lake Erie, we applied a bioenergetics model to determine their total fish consumption, The important nesting species included the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), Ring-billed Gull (L. delawarensis), Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias), Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), and Great Egret (Casmerodius albus). The impact of migrant waterbirds, including the Red-breasted Merganser (Mergus serrator), on western Lake Erie fish biomass was also considered in the analysis. According to the modeling results, during the early 1990s, piscivorous waterbirds consumed 13,368 tonnes of fish from western Lake Erie each year. This tonnage was equivalent to 15.2% of the prey fish biomass needed to support the walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) population in western Lake Erie during a single growing season. The model application was useful in quantifying energy flow between birds and fish in a large lake ecosystem.																				1938-5129				FEB	1995	97	1					141	153		10.2307/1368992	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1368992													WOS:A1995QK93800015

Determination of carbohydrate allocation patterns in water hyacinth to discover the potential physiological weak points in its life cycle	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The seasonal allocation of carbohydrates in water hyacinth was evaluated to determine the physiological weak points in the life cycle of this plant in three large, moderately polluted freshwater canals north of the Nile Delta (Egypt). Monthly plant samples were divided into laminae, petioles, stolons, stem-bases and roots to determine the seasonal changes in water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), starch and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) for each plant organ. Generally, water hyacinth allocated 2.2% of its total biomass to stolons, 4.5% to stem-bases, 19.0% to roots, 21.1% to laminae and 53.1% to petioles. The proportion of biomass allocated to the root system (stolons, stem-bases and roots) decreased from 38.5% in April to 17.2% in July, while that of the shoot system (laminae and petioles) increased from 61.5% to 82.8% during the same period. Stem-bases were found to contain the highest concentrations of WSC, starch and TNC throughout the water hyacinth's life cycle. Starch represented the greatest part of the TNC pool, surpassing the concentration of WSC by 3.1- to 8.3-fold. The highest contents (g/m(2)) of WSC, starch and TNC were found in petioles. The period in the seasonal cycle when water hyacinth is expected to be most vulnerable to a control technique is when the carbohydrate contents are at the lowest. Based on the present study, this would be in April before complete mobilization of stored carbohydrates in the stem-bases and stolons have allowed expansion of the leaf material and the maximum growth rate.

Estimation of water temperature of large lakes in cold climate regions during the period of strong coupling between water and air temperature fluctuations	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Near-surface bulk water temperature measured in large northern lakes during the warm season with buoys can be characterized by three components: a slowly varying seasonal-/climate-related trend, fluctuations at the time scale of weather perturbations, and rapid daily fluctuations. When thermal infrared data are used to estimate surface water temperature, an additional term relating the differences between the skin and bulk temperatures is implied. Buoy data in this work serve to demonstrate the existence of a period of strong signal coupling between fluctuations of water temperature and air temperature. The period of strong signal coupling does not extend beyond the date of maximum temperature in the water temperature trend. During this period, a simple linear transformation of air temperature fluctuations can be used to simulate the buoy water temperature fluctuations. Attempts to simulate water temperature fluctuations from air temperature alone are not possible beyond this period. Water temperature simulation error depends on the distance of the air temperature measurement from the buoy, ranging from +/- 1.1 degrees C at 0 km to +/- 1.4 degrees C at 40 km. The method developed with buoy data is applied to the combination of satellite thermal infrared and operationally measured air temperature data to simulate water temperatures. Through the use of satellite data, the water temperature simulations are extended beyond the period of strong coupling.																			0739-0572	1520-0426				FEB	2007	24	2					285	296		10.1175/JTECH1973.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JTECH1973.1													WOS:000244276800012

One of the major steps of such a delta(18)O(P) reconstruction is the calculation of the delta(18)O of the lake water (delta(18)O(L)) from the valve delta(18)O, which includes an appropriate estimate of the past water temperature during valve formation. In order to simulate changes in lake vertical temperature profile and specifically the bottom water temperature during ostracod valve formation, we have redeveloped a one-dimensional eddy diffusion thermal lake model including a lake ice model and refined it by including a seasonal light extinction model. This model was tested for two different sites, Lac d'Annecy and Ammersee. Sensitivity studies show that the ostracod calcification temperature is approaching constant 3.7degreesC for colder, but may significantly vary for warmer than present conditions. In Lac d'Annecy, such temperature effects can lead to a significant underestimation of positive delta(18)O(P) excursions. In Ammersee the underestimation is smaller because the hypolimnic temperatures are less sensitive to surface temperature changes. Our model can be used to better constrain such temperature effects and such further increase the quality of the delta(18)O(L) and delta(18)O(P) reconstruction.					von Grafenstein, Ulrich/F-6991-2010; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/G-1995-2011	von Grafenstein, Ulrich/0000-0002-3338-5627; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/0000-0001-8296-381X; DANIS, Pierre-Alain/0000-0002-4787-347X													2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 10	2003	108	D19							4609	10.1029/2003JD003595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JD003595													WOS:000185928800003

Total suspended particles show a similar size distribution both dry and rainy seasons (MMDs similar to 2.5 mu m). The inorganic water soluble ions are similar to 30% by mass of the TSP, from which, SO4-Cl-NH4 represent similar to 80%, and sulphate accounts for similar to 50%. An important enrichment respect to marine aerosols (>> 40%) was observed in the sequence: Cl- < Mg2+ < SO42- < Ca2+ < K+. The substantially high non-sea-salt Cl- contrast with the considerable deficit of Cl- found in other savannah regions of Venezuela where this ion has a mainly marine origin. Several ions have similar mass median diameter: SO42- and NH4+ (MMDs similar to 0.7 mu m); Na+, Cl- and Mg2+ (MMDs similar to 3.6 mu m); K+ and NO3- (MMDs similar to 2.5 mu m), which held for both dry and rainy seasons. NH4+ and SO42- species are confined to the fine fraction < 1.5 mu m, which represent similar to 85% of the total atmospheric concentration, and the larger amount of them is associated with particles < 0.49 mu m. Water soluble particles have higher concentrations of inorganic ions than those observed in other regions of Venezuelan savannah, where important vegetation burning occurs during the year. Substantially higher differences are observed in SO42-, Ca2+, NH4+ and Cl- which can be up to 28; 7; 7 and 5 times higher, respectively. In general, the results indicate that in Maracaibo Lake Basin, large agricultural and natural vegetation areas are probably affected by up wind anthropogenic sources as Oil and Petrochemical industry and the city of Maracaibo with medium size industries; and that in this region, the atmosphere is not significantly polluted by emissions from burnt vegetation.

The native short-tailed mouse, Leggadina lakedownensis, had a median home range of 4.8 ha. This area increased during the non-breeding season (5.3 ha) compared with the breeding season (3.0 ha), but this difference was not significant. In contrast, the median home range for the house mouse, Mus domesticus, was smaller (2.8 ha), although this was variable. Core areas were best represented by the 75% and 60% isopleths for M. domesticus and L. lakedownensis, respectively. Core areas were greater in L. lakedownensis (1.0 ha) than in M. domesticus (0.8 ha). Furthermore, the degree of overlap in core areas was low for L. lakedownensis, but absent for M. domesticus. There was no evidence that M. domesticus used burrows as refuges. Instead, they sheltered in dense bushes above ground during the day where air temperatures were ameliorated by the cover. L. lakedownensis rested in burrows during the day where high air temperatures were maintained at a constant 28 degrees C, and a relative humidity of between 72-97%. Burrow morphology was simple and comprised two types: burrows with a single chamber, and those without a chamber, indicative of a solitary habit. These results suggest that a fossorial behaviour in L. lakedownensis may lower its water economy compared with M. domesticus, which shelters above ground.

Trends could be seen for temperature, pH, and dissolved O2 and Mn. Wells located within 15 m of the river show a significant seasonal variation in dissolved Mn. A threshold temperature of 10-degrees-C seems to be necessary in order to trigger and maintain Mn solubility (microbiologically mediated reactions). Farther from the river, where the temperature is relatively constant, there is little seasonal variation in dissolved Mn. Some of the boreholes contain little Mn (0.5 mumol L-1) while in others the Mn concentration is very high (up to 25 mumol L-1). Hypotheses proposed for the high dissolved Mn content in these wells are (a) a local control of the redox conditions by organic matter in aquifer sediments and (b) a different mineralogical source of Mn.																			0013-936X					MAY	1994	28	5					868	876		10.1021/es00054a018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00054a018								22191828					WOS:A1994NJ32400022

Predicting microalgae growth and phosphorus removal in cold region waste stabilization ponds using a stochastic modelling approach	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												A stochastic ecological model with an integrated equilibrium temperature model was developed to predict microalgae growth and phosphorus removal in cold region waste stabilization ponds (WSPs). The model utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to account for parameter uncertainty. The equilibrium temperature model was parameterized using field data collected from two WSPs in Nunavut, Canada, from 2012 to 2014. The equilibrium temperature model provided good agreement with field data on a daily time step. The full model was run using historic (1956-2005) temperature and solar radiation data from five communities (Baker Lake, Cambridge Bay, Coral Harbour, Hall Beach, Resolute) in Nunavut, Canada. The communities represented a range of geographical locations and environmental conditions. Logistic regression on pooled model outputs showed that mean July temperature and mean treatment season temperature (June 1-September 15, ice-free period) provided the best predictors for microalgae growth. They had a predictive success rate of 93 and 88%, respectively. The modelled threshold (50% probability from the Monte Carlo simulation) for microalgae growth was 8.7 and 5.6 degrees C for the July temperature and mean treatment season temperature, respectively. The logistic regression was applied to each community (except Sanikiluaq) in Nunavut using historic climate data and a probability of microalgae growth was calculated. Based on the model results, soluble phosphorus concentrations consistent with secondary treatment could be achieved if WSP depth is less than 2m. The model demonstrated a robust method to predict whether a microalgae bloom will occur under a range of model parameters.

J	Lichvar, R; Gustina, G; Bolus, R				Lichvar, R; Gustina, G; Bolus, R			Ponding duration, ponding frequency, and field indicators: a case study on three California, USA, playas	WETLANDS												Playas are temporarily ponded, shallow, intermittent lakes found in the and southwest United States formed by rainfall and runoff in the wet season. Because playas are considered "Waters of the United States" (WoUS) under Federal Regulations 33 CFR 328.3 [a], their jurisdictional extent is delineated by either observation of ponded water or physical characteristics that represent ordinary high water marks that remain after the water has receded. To date, no surface hydrologic studies have described the frequency and duration of ponded water within desert playa systems to facilitate the understanding of "ordinary" for delineation purposes. To establish a baseline to support further the concept of "ordinary," we used 20 years of historical satellite imagery of playas in the western Mojave Desert, California, in combination with 59 years of precipitation records, to provide a case study of frequency and duration of ponding in playas in the and southwestern United States. Ponding was found to occur for at least 16 days, with a frequency of 51% or approximately every other year. We estimated the average antecedent precipitation needed to initiate ponding to be 8.29 cm. In years when rainfall exceeded 8.29 cm between October and March, the playas also ponded for 16 days into the growing season (March-November). The total length of the ponding period through the wet season ranged between I and 32 weeks, with a predictable relationship between length of inundation and total rainfall during the wet season. This range of occurrence of ponded water on these and playas expresses the climatically unevenly distributed precipitation pattern, both spatial and temporally. Analysis of the ponding duration and frequency from this study site acts as a baseline for further refinement of the concept of ordinary high water and provides a basis for further development of field indicators for delineation purposes of and southwestern playas.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2004	24	2					406	413		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0406:PDPFAF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0406:PDPFAF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222485000014
J	Westphal, KS; Chapra, SC; Sung, W				Westphal, KS; Chapra, SC; Sung, W			Modeling TOC and UV-254 absorbance for reservoir planning and operation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Total organic carbon (TOC) is an important indicator of water quality in drinking water supply systems. Prescribed chlorination rates are often based on TOC levels, and levels of disinfection byproducts (DBP) can be subsequently approximated. Unfortunately, TOC is difficult to measure, and some water utilities rely on the more easily measured absorbance of ultraviolet light (specifically at a wavelength of 254 nm, abbreviated UV-254) as a surrogate indicator of organic content. For daily or weekly operating purposes, measurements of UV-254 can provide inexpensive and meaningful prescriptive guidance for disinfection processes. However, for longer term planning periods (monthly, seasonal, or annual) over which the minimization or reduction of TOC is an objective, a modeling approach may be necessary, and in a modeling environment, simulating TOC with simple mass balance relationships is much less data intensive than simulating light absorbance. This study aims to (1) develop a simple mass balance model for TOC in a stratified drinking water reservoir that can be used to help minimize TOC in real time and over longer term planning periods, and (2) demonstrate that TOC and UV-254 are well correlated, so that either value can be used as model input or output. The study shows that TOC and UV-254 are correlated reasonably well in a water supply reservoir for Boston, MA, and that a simple mass balance tool can effectively assist with planning and operations management using UV-254 as a primary water quality indicator.

Neomysis integer, which underwent 2 generations during the study year (1992), occurred in high density, the maximum being 0.8 ind. l(-1) or 1250 ind. m(-2). Estimated production was 2.2 g DW (dry wt) m(-2) yr(-1) and peaked in August at 25 mg DW m(-2) d(-1). The laboratory predation experiments revealed a high predation potential on Eurytemora affinis, the maximum predation rates on nauplii and copepodites + adults being 52 and 8 ind. mysid(-1) h(-1), respectively. Stepwise multiple regressions on the data obtained from enclosure experiments conducted at various densities of N. integer and three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus revealed that the number of nauplii and the total number of E. affinis were significantly negatively related to the densities of both N. integer and fish, albeit positively the interaction between fish density and N. integer density. In addition, the density of the advanced stages was significantly negatively related to that of fish, while the chlorophyll a concentration was weakly negatively related to E. affinis biomass and highly positively related to that of N. integer. The results provide further evidence that N. integer enhances eutrophication in nutrient-rich brackish lakes, i.e. N. integer predation on zooplankton reduces grazing pressure on the phytoplankton. Moreover, the results indicate that mysids also stimulate phytoplankton growth more directly.

J	Chrzanowski, TH; Grover, JP				Chrzanowski, TH; Grover, JP			Temporal coherence in limnological features of two southwestern reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Properties of aquatic ecosystems have recently been considered in a landscape context where lakes in a geographic area are examined to identify common and long-term behavior patterns for one or more variables. Identifying such temporally coherent features should permit generalizations about lake behavior in specific regions and therefore, predictive models based upon such information should have broad applicability within a regional landscape. We considered the temporal coherence of a number of physical, chemical, and biological features of two southwestern reservoirs that differed in age, watersheds, and trophic status to identify common landscape-level predictors of behavior. We found synchronous behavior (temporal coherence) associated with particulate nutrient dynamics (organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphate (PP)), dissolved factors that force plankton dynamics (total dissolved phosphate, reactive phosphate and reactive silicate (SRSi), and with nutrient ratios used as indices of nutrient limitation in the plankton (TDN:TDP, C:P, and N:P). Algal parameters related to biomass (chlorophyll and Simpson's diversity index) did not vary coherently but algal genus richness and bacterial abundance did. Temperature was identified as a forcing function explaining synchronous variability in all cases except SRSi, PP, C:P, N:P, bacteria, and richness. The two systems, although managed for different purposes, behaved similarly with respect to several commonly measured limnological features, most notably, those involving phosphorus. We conclude that it may be possible to use such analysis to establish reference conditions for reservoirs in a given geographic region.

J	Schulz, M; Gücker, B				Schulz, M; Gücker, B			Macrophytes increase spatial patchiness of fluvial sedimentary records and effect temporal particulate nutrient storage	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Previous studies on fluvial substrates often lack high spatial resolutions for sedimentary characteristics in relation to biotic structures, such as the aquatic vegetation. A sedimentological survey was therefore performed in a section of the Lower River Spree, in order to analyse the riverbed substrates for small-scale changes in grain size and nutrient parameters, indicative of the impact of submerged macrophytes on sediment composition and particulate nutrient retention. We cored the riverine substrate using a systematic grid of 3 m width and 10 m length, and mapped the aquatic vegetation. Sedimentary records were characterised according to facies, grain size and carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus analyses. Facies description and statistics for the sedimentary parameters provided evidence for a significant riverbed patchiness, which was related to the occurrence of macrophytes. In vegetated areas, stable fine sands were covered by an organic layer, a facies significantly different from that of non-vegetated areas, which comprised coarse sandy to gravely sediments. Distinct facies alternated in short distances across the river, partly due to the effects of macrophytes on the flow regime. Mean particulate nutrient concentrations were two orders of magnitude higher in vegetated (TOC 5.16, TN: 0.50 and TP: 0.24 of dry matter (DM)) than in non-vegetated sediments (TOC: 0.27, TN: 0.03 and TP: 0.06 DM). Therefore, the organic layer contained nearly the entire nutrient pool of the surface sediments, and thus significantly contributed to a temporary retention of particulate nutrients (at maximum 80 g nitrogen m(-2) month(-1) and 38 g phosphorus m(-2) month(-1)) during vegetation period. Submerged macrophytes were found to effect a considerable spatial heterogeneity in riverbeds, and to cause high seasonality in particulate nutrient retention, a result amending previous geological facies analyses.					; Gücker, Björn/M-3316-2019	Gucker, Bjorn/0000-0002-0884-8650; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				MAR	2005	11	1					89	107		10.1007/s10498-004-2247-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-004-2247-1													WOS:000226506400005

Diester and monoester phosphates, phosphonates, tri- and/or tetrapolyphosphates, and orthophosphate were detected in these samples. Use of the lanthanide shift reagent (LSR) praseodymium ethlylenediamine tetraacetate, alkaline bromination degradation procedures, and adjustment of sample pH in conjunction with P-31-NMR spectroscopy provided additional information regarding the SUP. It was found that the SUP pool exists as a variety of organic phosphorus compounds which vary with respect to their apparent molecular size. Secondly, P-31-NMR data from Crystal Lake demonstrate that the SUP composition varies as a function of season and/or general lake conditions. Thirdly, comparison of Crystal Lake and Mississippi River spectral data shows that the SUP composition differs between distinct hydrological sites. P-31-NMR spectral data, in conjunction with other information such as LSR data, pH adjustment data, and alkaline bromination data, also illustrate that a portion of the SUP may become incorporated into an aggregate that forms during UF/RO concentration procedures.

J	Savijarvi, H				Savijarvi, H			Diurnal winds around Lake Tanganyika	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Regular diurnal Variations of coastal winds are observed around Lake Tanganyika during the dry season, when insolation is intense and the prevailing trade winds are weak. The long deep lake is at the bottom of the East African rift valley. A two-dimensional mesoscale model across the schematic rift-valley topography is used to study these local tropical winds. The full model gives a good simulation when compared with the observed winds on the east coast. It turns out that about half of the strong diurnal wind variation there, in the form of slope winds, is due to the sloping mountains. Roughly one quarter is due to the thermal lake effect (sea breeze), and one quarter is due to the existence of the south-easterly trade wind, which enhances the sea-breeze circulation component considerably during daytime, and adds on to the downslope winds during night-time. The wind field across the lake is quite variable from hour to hour and from place to place, yet predictable to a good extent during the dry season, when the external conditions are rather similar from day to day.																			0035-9009					APR	1997	123	540	B				901	918																WOS:A1997XB53400005

Analyses of sediments, radiocarbon dates, faunal remains, and artifacts show that the site was first occupied by people at about 10 500 B.P., when local environments were more open than today. By 9500 B.P., boreal forest had moved into the area, and human use of the site was minimal until about 7000 B.P., when a brief occupation of the site probably included a human burial. Use of the site intensified after about 4500 B.P., possibly because the cave became more accessible. The site was used both as a residential base camp and as a more temporary hunting station or lookout.					; Driver, Jonathan/D-1013-2009	Driver, Jonathan/0000-0002-9782-641X; 													0004-0843					SEP	1996	49	3					265	277																WOS:A1996VL12500005
J	Ridal, JJ; Kerman, B; Durham, L; Fox, ME				Ridal, JJ; Kerman, B; Durham, L; Fox, ME			Seasonality of air-water fluxes of hexachlorocyclohexanes in Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We investigated the seasonality of the air-water gas transfer of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) in Lake Ontario. These organochlorine pesticides were measured in air and water samples collected on weekly cruises on Lake Ontario from May to October 1993. Air concentrations ranged from 51 to 200 pg m(-3) for alpha-HCH and from 8 to 133 pg m(-3) for gamma-HCH. Surface water concentrations of alpha-HCH showed a small seasonal variation: mean values decreased from 922 +/- 73 pg L(-1) in May to 679 +/- 47 pg L(-1) in August and gradually increased to 897 +/- 76 pg L(-1) by October. Levels of gamma-HCH did not show seasonal differences and averaged 357 +/- 25 in surface waters. Air-water fugacity gradients of alpha- and gamma-HCH were used to predict the direction of air-water gas exchange of these isomers. Reversals in exchange direction were observed for both compounds on time scales of days, weeks, and months. On average, air-water gas transfer of HCH was depositional in May and early June, reversed to volatilizational by August, and returned to depositional for both HCH isomers in October. Net fluxes of alpha-HCH calculated using a two-film gas exchange model ranged from -50 (deposition) to 25 ng m(-2) day(-1) (volatilization). Net fluxes of gamma-HCH ranged from -63 to 7 ng m(-2) day(-1). We estimate that 15 kg of alpha-HCH was removed and 37 kg of gamma-HCH was added to take Ontario by air-water gas transfer from May to October 1993.

Effect of habitat structure on ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) associated to two pioneer tree species	SOCIOBIOLOGY												The present study investigates the effects of the host tree species and the surrounding habitat structure (preserved and disturbed ecotone and interior forest) on the richness, abundance and composition of the ant fauna. It was developed at the State Park of Rio Doce, in the middle basin of the Doce river, South Eastern Brazil. The studied plants were Mabea fistulifera Mart. (Euphorbiaceae), a forest border ecotone pioneer species, and Byrsonima sericea DC. (Malphigiaceae), a forest-lake ecotone colonizer species. Ants were sampled on the tree crowns for using a beating device, during one dry and two wet seasons thus comparing ecotone and interior forest habitats. In total 335 ant individuals were collected belonging to 5 subfamilies, 15 genera and 40 species. A MANOVA model shows differences in species richness only for the wet season of 2001, where the mean number of ant species per tree was nearly double in the ecotones than in the forest, regardless of which host plant. Ant abundance did not differ between habitats (ecotone and forests), but B. sericea had, on average, three times more ant individuals on its crown than M. fistulifera in the wet season of 2001. In addition, this value found for M. fistulifera was higher than any other overall abundance estimate in the following dry or wet season. A discriminant analysis showed how the ant fauna composition was distinct in the disturbed ecotone site between sampling periods, which demonstrate how a disturbance can modify the ant species composition in comparison with preserved habitats. However, the ant fauna on M. fistulifera in the interior forest and on B. sericea in the ecotone were more similar than any other sub-set of species, suggesting that micro-habitat ecological conditions and geological history could influence more ant species distribution than host plant or ecotone-interior contrasts.

BP, a brief interstadial during marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 2. Both records exhibit marked changes that are interpreted as responses to climatic changes. The diatoms and terrestrial vegetation appear to respond at the same time; any relative lag in the response of the vegetation was less than the ca. 60 yr resolution of the two records. The interval coincides, at least in part, with the Campo Imperatore Stade, when the Gran Sasso ice sheet reached its maximum extent and water level was high in the Fucino Lake. Correlation of the marked environmental oscillation with one of the Dansgaard-Oeschger Events recorded by stable oxygen isotope records from the Greenland ice-cap is proposed. This follows an interval interpreted as having a cold dry climate and correlated with a Heinrich Event in the North Atlantic. Together the two records enable a multifactorial interpretation of the palaeoclimate changes that characterise the oscillation, providing additional insight to that obtained from studies of ice and ocean-sediment cores, especially with respect to the seasonality of temperature and precipitation.

J	Ross, J; Gilbert, R				Ross, J; Gilbert, R			Lacustrine sedimentation in a monsoon environment: the record from Phewa Tal, middle mountain region of Nepal	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A watershed-scale approach to the sedimentary environment of the Phewa Tal drainage basin is used to assess rates and patterns of sediment accumulation within Phewa Tal reservoir. The susceptibility of surficial materials to erosion and transportation is highest in the early part of the monsoon season but major erosional events also occur during the monsoon proper. Thus, sediment delivery to the reservoir is at least two orders of magnitude higher during the monsoon than the dry season. In the reservoir, suspended sediment is distributed mainly by interflows at 4 to 6 m and 8 to 12 m depth. Phewa Tal has four distinct sedimentary environments as interpreted from the sedimentary record in cores. (1) The deltaic environment, which receives sediment directly from the main inflowing stream, the Harpan Khola, and from up-valley wetlands and agricultural fields, experiences rates of sedimentation of up to 1 m a(-1). (2) The delta-proximal region where clearly varved sediments are deposited in response to the annual monsoon, has a mean rate of sedimentation is 23.5 mm a(-1). (3) The distal environment is beyond the influence of sediment-charged interflows, and is characterised by accumulation from suspension to form largely massive deposits, so that annual rates of sedimentation cannot be determined stratigraphically. (4) The region near the Pardi Dam is dominated by seasonal flushing and erosion of fine sediments during the monsoon. The sedimentary record documents the geomorphic processes of the drainage basin, especially as controlled by the monsoon, and indicates the impact of human occupance in the drainage basin in the twentieth century. The useable life of the reservoir is estimated as 360 years. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Shrimps of an ancient Balkan lake: Bionomy and conservation	BIOLOGIA												In order to have a comprehensive evaluation and classification of the natural biota of Lake Pamvotis, the present study aims at investigating shrimps' bionomic traits. Information on shrimps' habitat preferences, abundances, and syntopic species in relation to the physicochemical profile of the lake's water are investigated for the first time. The study was carried out on a bi-monthly base, at six littoral sites of the lake. Samples' study from different habitats and seasons revealed that the freshwater shrimp Atyaephyra thyamisensis was the most abundant species, accounting for 44.76% of the total taxa catch, while the grass shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius was less abundant (7.54%). Syntopic fish species in the littoral zone of Lake Pamvotis such as Economidichthys pygmaeus, Gambusia holbrooki, Knipowitschia caucasica and Rutillus panosi showed interannual differences with abundances of 24.12%, 19.13%, 4.26% and 0.20%, respectively. Correspondence analysis revealed clear patterns between species and stations. A. thyamisensis was predominant in shallow, well oxygenated water bodies rich with aquatic vegetation, but it was absent from deeper habitats. P. antennarius was found mainly in lentic water bodies, rocky substratum and deeper habitats. Taking into account the high ecological importance of the freshwater shrimps in ecosystems' energy flow, ecological and biological data of lake's shrimps are discussed and presented thoroughly. Threats and conservation measures for both shrimp species are debated also in detail.

This river receives significant nutrient input from domestic sewage, agricultural crops, farms and piggeries. The study presents as main objective the analysis of the conditions of the cited water body, considering eutrophication aspects, for the hydrological year from October 2008 to September 2009, based on the results from bimonthly water quality monitoring developed within, upstream and downstream the reservoir. It was verified the influence of rainfall and seasonality on different water bodies trophic states classification methods. Trophic state classification was made according to Trophic State Index (TSI) and different mathematical models, including Salas and Martino, OECD, and Carlson and Lamparelli models. It was concluded that different classification models may result in different trophic level classes and that rainfall and seasonal conditions present large influence on the classification. Thus, it is very important the choice of models and indices according to the region weather and water bodies conditions. It was also concluded that water from the river monitored point located downstream the reservoir presented better quality than that from point located upstream, indicating that the reservoir may be working, improperly, as a stabilization pond.

J	Allan, JC; Kirk, RM				Allan, JC; Kirk, RM			Wind wave characteristics at Lake Dunstan, South Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Information on wave statistics, seasonal characteristics, and their distribution about lacustrine shorelines is virtually non-existent. The absence of such data limits the effective management of lake shores where issues of shoreline erosion are no less significant than on open ocean coasts. Results from instrumentally measured waves during seven storm events in 1995 are presented for the Clutha Arm of Lake Dunstan, South Island, New Zealand. The significant wave height ranged from 0.07 to 0.57 m with a mean of 0.28 m, whereas the maximum wave reached 1.05 m. Peak spectral wave periods ranged from 1.7 to 3.6 s with a mean of 2.46 s. The largest and most destructive waves are observed along the southern shore of the Clutha arm where fetch lengths are at their maximum. These waves exhibit the longest and widest range of periods and are generally the steepest waves, making them highly erosional at the shore. Correlations of waves with those predicted by NARFET, a deepwater wave-hindcasting computer model, revealed reasonable predictions of the wave height (R = 0.77-0.81), particularly for sites exposed to longer fetches, while the correlations with the wave period were lower (R = 0.56-0.69). Wave hindcasting indicates that the wave regime in the Clutha Arm is hi-directional, with most waves arriving from the north or south. Findings from Lake Dunstan have important implications for larger lakes located throughout New Zealand, where considerably larger waves can be expected to occur during severe storm events.																			0028-8330					DEC	2000	34	4					573	591		10.1080/00288330.2000.9516959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2000.9516959													WOS:000166432100001

The extensive wetlands around the Tonle Sap support a high level of biodiversity of great importance not only to the Tonle Sap but to the entire Mekong river system. Time-series of MODIS 500m 8 Day Surface Reflectance product imagery covering the period 2000-2005 were used to establish seasonal flooding cycles and flooding extents, and ASTER surface reflectance product was used to map vegetation distributions. Water resource use on the Mekong upstream of the Tonle Sap is reducing and moderating the monsoonal flood pulse which sustains the lake and floodplain system. This can be linked to the timing of large dam construction within the Mekong River basin. There is an urgent need to develop more effective cross-border management plans and cooperation for the water resources of the Mekong system before the unique and economically important Tonle Sap region slips into further decline.																			2153-6996		978-1-4244-1211-2				2007							5028	5031																WOS:000256657304155

For that reason, three oxbow lakes were chosen: Lake Labiste pod Opocinkem (east of Pardubice), Lake Dolehdj (near Kolin), and Lake Obristvi (near Melnik). All of them are situated within an area with a well-developed chemical industry and the nearby lowlands are one of the most intensively farmed areas of the Czech Republic. In spite of the identical origin during the river canalization, major differences were found. E.g. very low oxygen saturation in Opocinek (mean saturation 46 %) was determined. Nutrient concentrations and their seasonal dynamics (nitrites, nitrates, ammoniated ions, and phosphates) differed in each lake as well. The lowest concentrations of heavy metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in sediment were found in the Dolehaj. In samples from Obristvi after a big flood in September 2002, the Index of Geoaccumulation increased only for Pb and decreased for Hg. This result indicated that the pollution has probably not been occurred during such floods.

Phytoplankton, bacteria and protozoa (heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates) were monitored at two contrasting pelagic sites (Kigoma and Mpulungu) during 3 consecutive years. In addition, spatial variation was studied along 3 north-south transects during contrasting seasons. The study period covered a wide range of limnological conditions, with mixing depth ranging from 13 to > 100 m and euphotic depth from 14 to 65 m. The consistently high bacterial biomass (up to 62 mu g Cl-1) and the high contribution of small phytoplankton (< 5 mu m) to the total phytoplankton biomass (on average 50 % in Kigoma and 84 % in Mpulungu) point to an important role of the microbial food web in the lake throughout the year. Total phytoplankton biomass increased during periods of low water column stability, with an increased biomass of small eukaryotic phytoplankton (2 to 5 pm) at both stations, together with autotrophic prokaryotic picoplankton at the southern station Mpulungu and diatoms at the northern station Kigoma. Heterotrophic bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (0.06 to 11.01 mu g Cl-1) and ciliates (up to 8.16 mu g Cl-1) did not show this seasonality. The main seasonal and spatial variability in the importance of the microbial food web seems therefore primarily linked to the contribution of small phytoplankton, which may be better adapted to lower average light intensities and higher N:P ratios during periods of deep mixing.

Assessment of arsenic mobility in sediments	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												The presence of arsenic in water and sediments from two lakes, Volvi and Koronia, located in N Greece was studied. Dissolved arsenic concentrations ranged between 10-80 mu g/L in Lake Volvi and 13-75 mu g/L in Lake Koronia, exhibiting the higher concentrations during the warm season. Total arsenic concentrations in sediments ranged from 0.7-16.6 mg/kg and 3.7-26.9 mg/kg in lakes Volvi and Koronia, respectively. A three-step sequential extraction procedure was employed to assess the mobility of arsenic in lake sediments. Sodium nitrate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and nitric acid were used to obtain mobile, mobilizable and residual arsenic fractions. Mobile and mobilizable fractions represent 0.5-22% and 7.7-36% of sedimentary arsenic. The possible remobilization of arsenic during sediment reuspension under a range of different initial pH values was also investigated.

J	NATIONS, BK; HALLBERG, GR				NATIONS, BK; HALLBERG, GR			PESTICIDES IN IOWA PRECIPITATION	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Rainfall was sampled for pesticides to assess their occurrence in precipitation and potential impacts on water resources. Three areas in lowa were sampled; two localities were in rural settings, and a third in an urban area. Fourteen pesticides, including ten herbicides and four insecticides, were detected from October 1987 through September 1990. Atrazine, alachlor, cyanazine, and metolachlor were the most commonly detected, with one or more of these four herbicides found in almost every rainfall sample during the growing season. Concentrations of individual pesticides ranged from 0.1-mu-g L-1 to 40.0-mu-g L-1, with most detections under 1.0-mu-g L-1. Pesticide detections in rainfall began in April and ended in July or August, probably related to the timing of chemical application and greater volatilization rates during warmer weather. Samples from the urban site had detections of the same agricultural chemicals found at the rural sites, but in lesser quantities. In addition to the commonly detected herbicides, three of the four insecticides detected in rainfall were only found in urban samples. Two of these have urban as well as agricultural uses. Some variation of pesticide detections were seen at the three sampling localities, related to regional and local use patterns. Concentrations were greater at sampling sites near fields where pesticides are applied, suggesting that local volatilization and distance of transport affect the concentrations in rainfall. Pesticide concentrations were highest at the beginning of a rainfall event with concentrations becoming lower in samples taken later in the event.																			0047-2425					JUL-SEP	1992	21	3					486	492		10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100030029x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100030029x													WOS:A1992JG87200028
J	Durham, BW; Pope, KL; Wilde, GR				Durham, BW; Pope, KL; Wilde, GR			Factors affecting regional variation in growth of channel catfish	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We related the length at age of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, an indirect measure of growth, to three climatic and five morphoedaphic variables in 144 Texas reservoirs. Growth of channel catfish ages 3 through 6 was negatively related to longitude, a factor that explained as much as 34% of the variation in length at age. Channel catfish length at age was not significantly related to latitude, conductivity, morphoedaphic index, mean depth, and maximum depth in all age-classes. Among age-7 channel catfish, length at age was positively related to reservoir area, which explained 35% of the variation in growth. A quadratic model for growing-season length explained 7-17% of the variation in length at age in all age-classes. Overall, length at age for channel catfish was greatest in reservoirs with intermediate growing seasons (approximately 270 d in length) and was lower when the growing-season length was either longer or shorter. Our results provide the first evidence that the length of growing season on a statewide or regional scale may affect the growth of channel catfish.

Earlier studies have shown that it is difficult to extract the natural background from the other sources of variation. By using the multilinear model three interpretable factors representing natural and anthropogenic processes could be extracted. The natural long-term variation, seasonal fluctuation and dilution of discharges in the recipient area could be extracted into their own factors, which could be easily visualized. The variation could be also presented with estimated variation in the water quality parameters caused by each of these natural or anthropogenic processes.

We analyzed the effects of changes in precipitation and soil water storage (SWS) on runoff generation using the path-analysis method (PAM) in Xinjiang River Basin (XJRB). By using multiple trend analysis we found that precipitation, SWS and runoff in XJRB fluctuated throughout the past 30 years with no monotonic trends at both annual and seasonal scales. Further analysis demonstrated that runoff is more sensitive to precipitation than to SWS in XJRB. PAM results showed that direct influence of precipitation on runoff was seven times as large as that of SWS. Moreover, the indirect influence of precipitation on runoff through SWS accounts for 11-31% of the total influence of precipitation on runoff. This information will improve the description of precipitation and runoff relationship as well as the planning and management of water resources.

This study focuses on the water quality dynamics in an organically polluted reservoir exhibiting long-term anoxification using two approaches: (1) field observations of seasonal changes in vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfide and (2) construction of a water quality prediction model based on an ecosystem model incorporated with anaerobic biochemical processes. Iron and sulfate reduction occurred simultaneously because nitrate-nitrogen was reduced by denitrifying bacteria after the anoxification, and iron reduction became the main factor of the increase in ammonium-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus. The redox state of the bottom sediment surface, when anoxification began to occur, greatly affected the water quality dynamics caused by gradual reductive reactions under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, the calculation accuracy of ammonium-nitrogen, phosphate-phosphorus, and sulfide was highly improved by modifying the conventional model based on the field observations. The characteristics of water quality under anaerobic conditions were sufficiently reflected in the upgraded ecosystem model. The proposed water quality prediction model could be used to quantitatively estimate the water environment dynamics in organically polluted water bodies. The model could be developed further in the future to solve the problems caused by long-term anoxification.																			1611-2490	1611-2504				OCT	2018	16	4					665	686		10.1007/s10333-018-0659-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-018-0659-6													WOS:000445230800003

Pollen analysis revealed characteristic differences among the assemblages of the Coastal Western Hemlock, Mountain Hemlock, and Engelmann Spruce - Subalpine Fir biogeoclimatic zones (the Alpine zone is less clearly identifiable). Cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) correctly group the sites according to their biogeoclimatic zones and also by geographic origin. DCA indicates a high correlation between the biogeoclimatic zones of the sample sites and annual precipitation (-0.89), January temperature (-0.77), annual temperature (-0.64), and growing-season precipitation (-0.68). Further analysis of the samples and eight environmental gradients using canonical correspondence analysis groups the pollen assemblages from the study sites into biogeoclimatic zones in relation to annual precipitation, growing-season precipitation, annual snowfall, annual temperature, and growing degree-days. These data are useful for testing whether or not postglacial pollen assemblages have modern analogues.					; Pellatt, Marlow/L-5915-2019	MATHEWES, ROLF/0000-0001-7637-199X; Pellatt, Marlow/0000-0002-3925-461X													0008-4026					MAY	1997	75	5					799	814		10.1139/b97-090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b97-090													WOS:A1997XK27500014
J	Barlocher, F; Biddiscombe, NR				Barlocher, F; Biddiscombe, NR			Geratology and decomposition of Typha latifolia and Lythrum salicaria in a freshwater marsh	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Growth, senescence, detachment and decomposition of leaves were studied in Typha latifolia and Lythrum salicaria in a freshwater marsh at 45 degrees 53'N, 64 degrees 20'W. Maximum plant height and number of leaves were reached by the middle of July in T. latifolia; both continued to increase until the middle of August in L. salicaria. Senescence started earlier in T. latifolia. By the end of September (end of growing season), 73% of the current year's crop of leaves of T. latifolia, and 82% of the leaves of L. salicaria were still attached to the stem. Of these, 77% (T. latifolia) and 75% (L. salicaria) were dead. Subsequently, leaf detachment in L. salicaria followed an exponential decay curve, and by December 13, only 7.8% remained. T. latifolia did not lose any leaves in the same period. In both plants, leaf decomposition was therefore largely initiated in the aerial phase. Decomposition and fungal colonization (based on ergosterol concentrations) were followed in dried leaves or leaf sections in litterbags, which were submerged (T. latifolia) or placed on the ground (L. salicaria), and in tagged leaves decaying while still attached to the stem. Leaching (estimated by loss of mass, phenolics and carbohydrates after one week's exposure) was generally higher in litterbag leaves than in tagged leaves (5 out of 7 comparisons), as were losses of mass over the entire experimental period of 12 weeks. Maximum ergosterol concentrations were six times higher in naturally decaying T. latifolia leaves than in litterbag leaves; on L. salicaria leaves the differential was 60%. Maximum fungal biomass was estimated to account for 1.2-1.6% (L. salicaria) or 3.6-5.4% (T. latifolia) of the organic mass of decaying leaves. We conclude that using predried leaves in litterbags overestimates leaching and underestimates the fungal contribution to the decomposition of emergent macrophytes.

J	Schwalb, A; Lister, GS; Kelts, K				Schwalb, Antje; Lister, Guy S.; Kelts, Kerry			Ostracode carbonate δ18O- and δ13C-signatures of hydrological and climatic changes affecting Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland, since the latest Pleistocene	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Stable oxygen and carbon isotope geochemistry of ostracode calcite from a core taken at a site 40 m deep in Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland, shows distinct and rapid shifts since deglaciation. These shifts are interpreted in terms both of climatic changes and of the impact of major changes in the catchment input. The Aar River, draining a high-altitude Alpine catchment, either entered or bypassed the lake during the latest Pleistocene to the mid-Holocene. During the Preboreal and two short intervals between interpolated ages of 7200 and 6950 yr BP and since 4850 yr BP the Aar River has bypassed the lake. During times of Aar River input, the isotopic ratios in ostracode valves are approximately 2 parts per thousand lower than during periods with only input from the Jura Mountains catchment. Isotopic signatures are interpreted in terms of a four fold chronology provided by pollen stratigraphy and AMS radiocarbon ages: (i) Oldest Dryas, (ii) Bolling/Allerod, (iii) Younger Dryas, and (iv) Holocene. The interpretation of the isotopic records depends upon a precise sedimentological analysis of the cores. The Oldest Dryas is characterized by clastic rhythmites, whereas the Bolling/Allerod and Younger Dryas to mid-Holocene periods are characterized by thinly-bedded, non-glacial rhythmites. The absence of the Aar River input during the Preboreal, the upper Older Atlantic as well as since 4800 yr BP, is characterized by the deposition of a massive calcareous silt comprising abundant authigenic calcite. Isotopic signatures of ostracodes from the Oldest Dryas reflect melting of Alpine glaciers and deglaciation conditions. The lowest delta O-18(PDB) values of about -11 parts per thousand are consistent with a mean temperature of annual precipitation (MTAP) of about 5-8 degrees C lower than that of the Holocene. From mid-Belling upwards, the record lacks evidence of meltwater from an Alpine ice cap. MATP estimated from the highest Bolling/Allerod delta O-18(PDB) values are similar to values estimated for the early to middle Holocene when Aar River water also inflowed into Lake Neuchatel. A abrupt lowering of delta O-18(PDB) values over the Younger Dryas interval is consistent with airmass temperatures 3-4.5 degrees C lower than that of the Holocene as suggested from other Swiss sites. Evidence of stronger seasonality during the Younger Dryas episode, such as very well-defined laminations, can partly explain the shift to lower delta O-18 values. The Holocene shifts in stable isotope ratios, however, are not interpreted in terms of MTAP shifts but rather shifts in the river-input balance.

J	Braddock, JF; Mccarthy, KA				Braddock, JF; Mccarthy, KA			Hydrologic and microbiological factors affecting persistence and migration of petroleum hydrocarbons spilled in a continuous-permafrost region	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Fuel spills, totaling about 1300 m(3), occurred between 1976 and 1978 adjacent to Imikpuk Lake, a drinking water source near Barrow, AK. Substantial contamination of soils and groundwater near the lake persists. We examined the magnitude and direction of groundwater flux and the microbial activity at this site to understand the persistence of contamination and its effect on the lake. We found that groundwater flux is small due to shallow permafrost, which restricts the cross-sectional area available for flow, and to the short annual thaw season (ca. 90 days). The small flux and limited depth also constrain contaminant transport and dispersion, resulting in persistent, shallow contamination. The numbers of hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms and their laboratory mineralization potentials for benzene (at 10 degrees C) were higher in samples from contaminated areas than in reference samples. Benzene mineralization potentials in groundwater samples were comparable to more temperate systems (0.1-0.5 mg of benzene mineralized L(-1) day(-1)) and were stimulated by nutrient additions. Field measurements of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, ferrous iron, and sulfide in groundwater provided evidence that biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons is occurring in situ. Despite evidence of an active microbial population, microbial processes, like contaminant transport, are likely limited at this site by the short annual thaw season.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG	1996	30	8					2626	2633		10.1021/es960070z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es960070z													WOS:A1996VA63700055
J	Cambray, JA; King, JM; Bruwer, C				Cambray, JA; King, JM; Bruwer, C			Spawning behaviour and early development of the Clanwilliam yellowfish (Barbus capensis; Cyprinidae), linked to experimental dam releases in the Olifants River, South Africa	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												This paper describes an investigation of how experimental releases of pulses of high flow from Clanwilliam Dam (Olifants River, South Africa) affect spawning of the Clanwilliam yellowfish, Barbus capensis. This species is endemic to the Olifants River system and is listed as rare in the Red Data Book of fishes for South Africa. Spawning sites are described, as is the spawning behaviour of B. capensis after specific experimental pulses released during the suspected spawning season of the species. Spawning and the developmental stages of embryos, free embryos, and larval B. capensis were studied using direct observations, video recordings, and microscopic examination of live embryos. B. capensis was found to be a repeat-spawner over several days as well as a multiple-spawner throughout the 4 month reproductive season. At present, spawning of B. capensis occurs down-stream of the dam sporadically (and possibly with limited recruitment), concurrent with releases of water for irrigation purposes. Experimental pulses appeared to trigger an increase in spawning activity, as an abundance of larvae was found down-stream 2 months later. It is suggested that a water-release strategy from Clanwilliam Dam could be designed to increase the number of B. capensis in the Olifants River.

These data, in conjunction with Fe, Mn, sulfide, and nutrient data, are used to assess the biochemical processes controlling the distribution of trace metals in the lake and how the importance of these processes varies with time. Thermodynamic calculations are used to examine changes in dissolved metal speciation in the bottom waters during the year and to assess the saturation state of metal-sulfide phases. Spatial and temporal changes in the redox conditions of the bottom waters result in increases in dissolved Co and Ni concentrations, peaks in particulate Co profiles, decreases in dissolved Cu and Cr concentrations, and significant changes in dissolved metal speciation during stagnation. The redox-driven cycling of Fe and Mn in the hypolimnion has a dramatic effect on Co distributions, a slight effect on Ni concentrations, and virtually no effect on Cd, Cu, Cr, and Zn concentrations. Biological uptake and regeneration processes result in a correlation between Zn and silicate concentrations throughout the water column, and it appears that biological cycling may also influence the distribution of Cd. During the sulfidic phase of stagnation dissolved Cd concentrations in the bottom waters may be controlled by metal-sulfide precipitation, Cr(VI) is probably reduced to more particle-reactive Cr(III) and removed by settling particles, and Cu(II) is most likely reduced to Cu(I) and precipitated as a metal-sulfide phase.					, James Murray/HCI-3547-2022	Murray, James/0000-0002-8577-7964													0024-3590					MAY	1992	37	3					529	548		10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0529	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0529													WOS:A1992JH23500007

Seasonal changes in sulfur biogeochemistry of a dilute, dimictic Arctic lake: Implications for paired sulfur isotope records from ancient oceans	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Calibration of ancient marine sulfate levels has been done largely using experimental studies of the kinetic isotope effect associated with microbial sulfate reduction and work from modern ocean basins or high-sulfate lakes that are largely restricted and meromictic. The sulfur isotope record of sulfates and sulfides from sedimentary sequences have been used to reconstruct sulfate levels throughout the geologic record and indicate that sulfate concentrations were low relative to modern oceans (28 mM) for most of Earth's history. Despite the higher potential for modern low-sulfate systems to be a better analog for ancient oceans, there are few sulfur isotope studies that have been carried out in these environments. Here, we present delta S-34 systematics of a modern low-sulfate (similar to 330-600 mu M) euxinic lake on the ice-free margin of southwestern Greenland. We find large isotope fractionations ( > 20 parts per thousand) between water column sulfate and sulfides, with this fractionation increasing from 23.9 parts per thousand during open-water conditions to 42.0 parts per thousand under annual ice-cover. While these large kinetic isotope effects associated with microbial sulfate reduction (epsilon(S)(R)) are expressed in the water column of this lake, the underlying sedimentary sulfides preserve a notably smaller range of 8 34 S values (13.0-26.6 parts per thousand). Geochemical modeling of our data suggests that the delta S-34 of water column sulfate and sulfides, along with sedimentary sulfides are primarily controlled by epsilon(S)(R) and a reservoir effect established under strong thermal stratification during open-water conditions. Under ice-covered conditions epsilon(S)(R) appears to be the dominant control on delta S-34 values, and when combining both seasonal data sets epsilon(S)(R) increases as a function of sulfate levels in the lake. Sulfur isotopic data presented here highlight the complexity of seasonal biogeochemical cycling of sulfur in low-sulfate systems, and how system openness affects delta S-34 fractionations in modern euxinic depositional environments. Specifically, a reservoir effect is only documented in the water column delta S-34 data under open-water conditions, however a reservoir effect is apparent from sedimentary sulfides under both ice-cover and open-water conditions due to time averaging pyrite delta S-34 values. Our results add to the growing body of work on modern low-sulfate systems to help further constrain the use of ancient delta S-34 records for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

Semen was collected weekly by abdominal massage from 26 males in March. In collected semen, volume, motility, duration of motility, concentration and pH were determined. In the L. abu sperm, volume (mu l), motility (%), duration of motility (s), concentration (x10(9)/ml), and pH values were found 45.76 +/- 3.55, 54.25 +/- 2.93, 330.15 +/- 37.92, 4.27 +/- 0.40 and 7.87 +/- 0.05, respectively. A correlation was found between semen volume and semen pH. Semen volume and the duration of sperm motility were higher in the 2nd and 3rd sampling dates than in the 1st and 4th sampling dates (P < 0.05; P < 0.01, respectively). Neither sperm motility nor sperm concentration was affected by sampling dates. Major changes in semen pH were observed in the 4th sampling date (P < 0.001). The Pearson correlation test presented significant relationships with the duration of motility, semen volume, and motility. Semen pH values were significantly correlated with the sperm concentration and semen volume. Sperm concentration was inversely correlated with semen volume. Sperm motility and duration significantly correlated with total weight. Total length significantly correlated with the duration of motility and total weight. In conclusion, these characteristics represent a valuable baseline dataset for establishing a semen quality standard and provide background information that may be useful for assisted breeding programs in this species.					; aral, faruk/AAX-6022-2021; ARAL, FARUK/JYO-5760-2024; Şahinöz, Erdinç/ABF-2239-2020; Dogu, Zafer/ABF-1991-2020	Dogu, Zafer/0000-0002-5428-8340; ARAL, FARUK/0000-0003-2297-6509; SAHINOZ, ERDINC/0000-0003-0646-6939													0920-1742					MAR	2008	34	1					71	76		10.1007/s10695-007-9148-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-007-9148-3								18649025					WOS:000253527500009

Collection of fish larvae and spawning activities of adult. white sucker indicated that spawning occurred in all tributaries of the lake. We did not observe evidence of spawning in the lake. White stickers began to mature at. age 3 and a total length of 275 mm. A larger proportion of males matured at an earlier age and length, but females lived longer and reached larger sizes. Mortality rates were higher for mature males than females. Both sexes exhibited high mortality after age S. Females were more abundant, than males (1.94 to 6.50: 1 F:M) in the Lipper lake throughout. the year, while males were more abundant in Bull Creck (0.27 to 0.30:1 F:M), a major tributary, during the spawning season. Fecundity increased with fish size, ranging from approximately 5,000 to 59,000 eggs. Growth of white sucker continued throughout. life, but, slowed dramatically after maturation. Although this southern population ill the Lake Taneycomo system spawned earlier than reported for most northern populations, its demographic attributes (age and length at maturity, fecundity, gonadosomatic index, fecundity, condition, and growth rates) were within ranges reported for other white sucker populations.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				DEC	2005	50	4					423	434		10.1894/0038-4909(2005)050[0423:LHAOWS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2005)050[0423:LHAOWS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000234496100002

The relative abundance and distribution of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) in these habitats was of interest because their recent invasion into the Great Lakes has the potential to disrupt native fish assemblages. A total of 15,867 fish comprised of 34 species were captured in 2,300 h of netting. The majority of fish over the whole study were caught in the outer marsh (63%, 9,957 individuals), and seasonally during late June (7,384 individuals/4 net-nights) and early May (2,281 individuals). Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), and silver redhorse (Moxostoma anisurum) were the most abundant species, comprising 85 percent of the total catch. Ruffe was the seventh most abundant species captured (294 individuals), comprising only two percent of the total catch. They were the fifth most abundant species in the outer marsh, but only thirteenth most abundant in the inner marsh. Ninety-one percent of all ruffe (268 individuals) were caught in the outer marsh. Of the 75 species by life-stage combinations derived by classifying all individuals captured into one of 3 life stage categories (YOY, yearling, and adult), yearling ruffe were the twelfth h most abundant, adult ruffe were sixteenth, and YOY ruffe were twenty-seventh. While ruffe have been rite most abundant fish captured in bottom trawls in St. Louis River estuary during the 1990s, our results indicate the invasion of ruffe in shallow, heavily vegetated areas like those in Allouez Bay has been much less successful. Our results also suggest further degradation of coastal wetlands and other vegetated habitats would eliminate significant refugia from ruffe competition and could lead to increased dominance of ruffe in shallow water habitats in the Great Lakes.																			0380-1330						1998	24	2					293	303		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70820-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70820-2													WOS:000074588400012
J	Johns, C; Timmerman, BE				Johns, C; Timmerman, BE			Total cadmium, copper, and zinc in two Dreissenid mussels, Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis, at the outflow of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Two closely related Dreissenid mussel species, Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis, both recent invaders of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River, have potential as biological monitors of metal contamination. To better understand their usefulness as biomonitors, we measured total cadmium, copper and zinc concentrations in soft tissues of both species at a site at the outflow of Lake Ontario. We examined total mean metal concentrations in soft tissues for both seasonal and interannual variability. Both mussel species exhibited elevated copper and cadmium concentrations compared to relatively uncontaminated waters. D. bugensis (quagga) mussels bioaccummulated higher levels of cadmium than D. polymorpha (zebra) mussels, while zebra mussels had higher concentrations of zinc and copper. Zebra mussels showed greater interannual variability in metal concentrations than quagga mussels. Total metal concentrations in both species were influenced by season, particularly stage in the reproductive cycle. The two species differed in their seasonal bioaccumulation patterns for both cadmium and zinc, but were similar in their seasonal variability of copper. We did not find a consistent pattern between shell length and total metal concentration for either species. Patterns of bioaccumulation for these species must be better known if they are to be used in biological monitoring programs to assess trends of contamination in the Great Lakes basin.																			0380-1330						1998	24	1					55	64		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70799-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70799-3													WOS:000072958100006

In 1990, in each of the sites, one 20 m x 20 m plot was cut. In each plot, 4-m2 plots were selected, both control and with litter removed. The number of suckers and their height were estimated for each plot in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Results showed that sucker production was not related to the number of P. tremuloides before the clearcut, but it was related to litter whereby increasing cover lowered the production. The number of suckers produced in the control plots did not show any significant difference along the successional sere for any of the three years. Scarified plots had more suckers than control plots, and this increase was more pronounced and significantly different for the younger stage. Regression analysis for the 1991 and 1992 data showed that sucker number in scarified plots decreased with increasing seral stage age. Mortality, after three growing seasons, was about 60% for all plots and was not affected by seral stage and treatment. We suggest that removal of litter in scarified plots exposed the roots to higher temperatures and caused wounds, both of which may have stimulated the production of suckers in young seral stages.																			1100-9233					SEP	1994	5	4					561	568		10.2307/3235983	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3235983													WOS:A1994PN43700015

These analyses were applied to three years of data from a reference lake and two experimental lakes located in Gogebic County, Michigan. We reconstructed seasonally averaged flows among two size groups of phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, microzooplankton, cladocerans, and copepods. The inverse analysis produced significantly different flow networks for the different lakes that agreed qualitatively with known chemical and biological differences between lakes and with other analyses of the impact of fish manipulations on food web structure and dynamics. The results pointed to alterations in grazing pressure on the phytoplankton that parallel changes in the size and abundance of cladocerans and copepods among lakes. Estimated flows through the microbial food web indicated low bacterial production efficiencies and small carbon transfers from the microbial food web to the larger zooplankton. This study demonstrates the use of inverse methods to identify and compare flow patterns across ecosystems and suggests that microbial flows are relatively insensitive to changes at the upper trophic levels.																			0706-652X					SEP	1994	51	9					2034	2044		10.1139/f94-206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-206													WOS:A1994QF32000015

Lake Solai is located 50 km north of Nakuru in the Rift Valley in Kenya at E36 degrees 80'-36 degrees 84' to N00 degrees 05'-00 degrees 08'. It is a shallow lake that follows a very peculiar seasonal water regime, and that faces conflicts between agriculture and conservation water users. In the upper catchment, an overview of the agricultural practices was implemented and river water uses were identified to assess river flows. Crops/grassland and woodland/shrubland were the major land uses, covering c. 65% of the catchment. Closer to the lake, vegetation samples were collected around the lake together with samples of environmental factors such as soil and water quality. Thirteen vegetation communities were identified within four main zonations: forest, grassland, river inlet and rocky outcrop. These communities showed abundance, distribution and diversity determined mostly by the human pressures, the flooding periods and the salinity. Cynodon, Cyperus and Sporobolus genera were the most abundant.

This work describes the spacial and temporal distribution of waterbirds in Santo Amaro Lake, in the Western portion of the Parque Nacional dos Lencois Maranheses, Maranhao State. This lake comprises 6,000 ha and given it's extension it is splited in three sites: "Alagadico" (2,200 ha), near Santo Amaro municipality and fulltime flooded; "Guaperiba/Ponta Verde" Lake (2,200 ha), with sandbanks and open areas, presenting a quick decreasing of the water level; and "Taquari" Lake (1,600 ha), with most of it's margin surrounded with dunes and open areas, fulltime flooded, but without macrophytes, presenting only sandbank vegetation. During the rainy season the observer conducted census from a motorboat at a velocity of 6 km/h, along a transect paralell to the lake's margin. In dry season the census was made through a fixed point. A total of 3,335 waterbirds were counted representing 18 species. The resident birds had greater abundance in the rainy season. The most exploited site in both seasons was Alagadico. The dry season presented greater abundance of migratory birds corresponding to their arrival from breeding areas in the Northern hemisphere. In both seasons Taquari lake was the most exploited by those birds. Resident birds breeds in Santo Amaro Lake in the rainy season and the gulls - believed to be an isolated population - used the Lake to foraging while breeding in the dunes near Taquari lake. A management plan is necessary for the Parque Nacional dos Lencois Maranhenses, specially in Santo Amaro Lake, as this lake is used by both resident and migratory waterbirds and used by the humans in the fishery activities.																			0103-5657					SEP-DEC	2009	17	3-4					173	182																WOS:000208354000002

Dynamics of zooplankton and ecosystem processes were examined for 3 yr following the manipulation and compared to 2-3 yr of premanipulation data. Sampling of vertebrate and invertebrate planktivores documented shifts in other members of the zooplanktivore guild as rainbow trout declined. Reduction of rainbow trout densities led to compensatory responses in other components of the Castle Lake fish assemblage as brook trout and golden shiners increased in abundance. This compensation resulted in increased rates of vertebrate planktivory on daphnids within 2 yr after trout stocking was discontinued. Zooplankton shifts in response to discontinuance of trout stocking were more rapid, particularly an immediate increase in a previously rare invertebrate predator (Diacyclops thomasi). Other limnological parameters also responded rapidly following the manipulation: water transparency declined and primary productivity (PPr) increased. In addition, intra-annual patterns (i.e., seasonal development) and the vertical distribution (shallow vs. deep) of PPr appeared to be affected by the food web manipulation. Our results indicate that complexities of real food webs complicate the prediction of the outcome of food web perturbations. Reduction of the previously dominant planktivore (rainbow trout) led to increases in other zooplanktivores (Diacyclops, golden shiners, brook trout) that resulted in enhanced predation pressure on zooplankton herbivores. Our results also indicate that alterations in water quality parameters (transparency, PPr) in response to food web alterations need not necessarily be mediated through changes in the abundance of Daphnia, as strong limnological responses preceded reductions in Daphnia by a year. We hypothesize an alternative mechanism for food-web-induced changes in lake ecosystem dynamics: changes in water clarity and productivity can result when cyclopoid predation strongly affects micrograzers.

Three series of field experiments with different zooplankton species composition and biomass were performed in a small lake in the south Andes. We attempted to measure the responses of phytoplankton species resulting from grazing mortality and stimulation of growth by nutrient recycling. 2. Nanoflagellates contributed substantially to total phytoplankton cell abundance. Chrysochromulina parva represented 93.4%, 92.2% and 95.9% of total phytoplankton density in December, January and February, respectively. This fraction was reduced in all treatments with increasing zooplankton biomass. 3. A negative relationship was obtained between C. parva cell numbers and increase in dissolved P. On the other hand, a significant positive relationship between the abundance of the diatom Aulacoseira granulata and P concentration was observed. These results indicate that the ungrazed diatom was able to capitalise on the increase in nutrient availability. 4. As a net result of the increase or decrease of algal species we observed a change in the nano:net phytoplankton relationship. The outcome of three-day incubations with increased zooplankton biomass was an increasing importance of net phytoplankton. 5. The results indicate the importance of the indirect effects of zooplankton (through nutrient recycling) in the increase in diatoms, and the role of grazing as a growth-limiting factor for the flagellate C. parva.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1998	40	1					41	49		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00326.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00326.x													WOS:000075462200004
J	Nieoczym, M; Kloskowski, J				Nieoczym, Marek; Kloskowski, Janusz			Habitat selection and reproductive success of coot Fulica atra on ponds under different fish size and density conditions	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fish may influence habitat selection and reproductive success in waterfowl. We investigated the effects of common carp Cyprinus carpio on breeding coots Fulica atra along a gradient of fish size structure and density, created by separate stocking of age cohorts in ponds in eastern Poland. Coot breeding densities were higher on ponds with low biomass of small-sized, young-of-the-year fish than on ponds with medium- or large-sized fish, stocked at high biomass densities; they also increased with increasing submerged vegetation biomass (an effect correlated with water transparency) and emergent vegetation cover. Densities of nektonic and epibenthic macroinvertebrates and of amphibian larvae were also negatively influenced by fish size/density gradient, while densities of emerging insects were not affected. However, coot breeding success per pair was similar among pond types, while positively related to submerged vegetation, indicating that either plant food abundance was more important than the overall trophic impact of fish or fledgling production was additionally limited by factors other than food. Carp may adversely affect pond habitats of waterfowl both via trophic interactions and through abiotic disturbance of ecosystem processes. In coots, however, the effects can be mitigated by maintenance of abundant emergent vegetation and of submerged macrophytes resistant to fish.					; Kloskowski, Janusz/AGQ-5060-2022	Nieoczym, Marek/0000-0003-1670-358X; Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2018	820	1					267	279		10.1007/s10750-018-3664-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3664-2													WOS:000437439300018

Paleoecological and isotopic analysis of fossil continental mollusks of Sandelzhausen (Miocene, Germany)	PALZ												The fossil molluscan fauna of Sandelzhausen (Early/Middle Miocene, SE Germany) comprises a total of 44 species, mostly terrestrial pulmonate snails. Herein we present a paleoecological analysis of this fauna based on an actualistic approach and on data on stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen (assessed from specimens of the freshwater lymnaeid snail Galba dupuyiana and the terrestrial clausiliid snail Pseudidyla moersingensis). The paleoecological reconstruction achieved here is in line with previous works, with some novelties and minor modifications. The basal sediment layers point to a swampy area with ponds and/or oxbow lakes (closed system, as indicated by the covariation between oxygen and carbon isotopic signals of G. dupuyiana), prone to seasonal flooding events. This environment would then gradually transition into a perennial lake, as indicated by: the proportion of planorbids, the appearance of aquatic species intolerant to desiccation, and the decoupling of the covariation between oxygen and carbon isotopic signals of G. dupuyiana. The terrestrial habitat would have developed from a more open environment (semi-arid/sub-humid scrubland) to a sub-humid/humid denser forest afterwards. Still, species from drier and more open environments are present throughout all the layers, suggesting that these habitats persisted in the lake's hinterland. The mean annual temperature, calculated from the oxygen isotopic composition of P. moersingensis, ranges from 18.5 to 20.5 degrees C, but with no significant trend of change throughout the layers.

They have often been recorded in abundance on the water's surface, while their presence in the benthic zone is poorly documented. A litterbag experiment was carried out in Coutos Lake, a shallow temporary lake in Southeast Brazil, in order to study the ecology and biology of Hydrozetes paulista. This mite species greatly dominated the benthic invertebrate community (82%), and at the end of the experiment it reached a density (652 individuals per 1 g of dry substrate) higher than that ever previously reported before for any Hydrozetes species. This density was correlated with some water parameters, stronger with conductivity, and less with temperature. The adults dominated in the stage structure (constituting over 80% of sample population), but the participation of the juveniles increased with the time. Larvae were first noticed on 25th day of experiment and after that were present for the rest of the season. During the course of this experiment, mite fecundity and body size decreased. This species is known as bisexual, but we observed only females in the 5354 adults we collected.

This graphic method has allowed Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge managers to set up electrified fences at Clear Lake Reservoir in advance of the nesting season, successfully protecting nesting colonies on two recent occasions. Digital Hydrographic Maps were also used to match historic hydrographic records for Clear Lake Reservoir to examine past lake conditions and changes in nesting island locations, particularly when nesting failures had occurred.

Different water regimes occurred in three subsequent vegetation periods; moderate floods in 2001, followed by a wet year, 2002, and an extremely dry year, 2003. Four groups of plants were distinguished according to their phenotypic plasticity to water level fluctuations. The plants exhibiting amphibious character prevailed over truly aquatic species. The wet season was found to cause more disturbances to macrophyte communities than an extremely dry season. Variations in species composition and abundance were more conspicuous at the two locations in the main stream, Strezn, meandering through the lake, while at the third location with more extreme water level fluctuations, variations were less evident.																					90-5782-153-2				2005							312	320																WOS:000231864300023

Thus, we present a detailed analysis of the Brochene Fluh section (Late Oligocene, MP29, to early Miocene, MN1), in which more than 30 charophytes levels have been recorded. It is possible to subdivide the section into six cycles: cycles one to four, Late Oligocene in age, present a covariance in the delta(13)C and delta(18)O variation, and are typical of small closed lakes subject to great seasonal changes (especially humidity). The last two cycles, of Aquitanian age, show a diminution of seasonality perhaps due to the ingression of the future Burdigalian sea. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

J	Abrusán, G				Abrusán, G			Morphological variation of the predatory cladoceran Leptodora kindtii in relation to prey characteristics	OECOLOGIA												The responses of invertebrate predators to changes in the morphology of their prey, and especially the responses for induced defences, are largely unexplored, compared with the vast amount of data on predator-induced defences. This study demonstrates that the size of the feeding basket, the anatomical structure used to capture prey by the predaceous freshwater cladoceran Leptodora kindtii, shows significant allometric changes with the average body size of the prey (herbivorous cladocerans) in six lakes of northeastern Poland. Prey density influences the basket size only in adult Leptodora individuals, whereas induced defences such as helmets of Daphnia sp. seem to have no effect on Leptodora's morphology. In a feeding experiment it is shown that the increase in the feeding basket enables Leptodora to capture larger prey. The seasonal pattern of morphological change, and its measurable benefit suggest that the observed morphological variability of Leptodora is phenotypic plasticity.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				JAN	2003	134	2					278	283		10.1007/s00442-002-1101-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-1101-7								12647169					WOS:000180822900014

In order to study the variation of proline content in quinoa and its relation to the environment, experiments were conducted with six varieties in two localities in Puno, Peru (Muyapampa-Juli, 3815masl; and Alto Catacha-Lampa, 3890masl) during the 1997-1998 growing season. The experiments included two repetitions, with dry or humid canals of the high beds (warn warns). The relation between the quinoa varieties and the localities under study was established according to the Finlay-Wilkinson method (1963), using four environmental indicators and the variety average. The results showed that proline content increased as environmental conditions became less favorable to the plants. In the dry environment of Alto Catacha, the proline content was higher than in the other environments, and in the cold Sum agroecological zone, with high temperature deviations between day and night, the proline content was higher than close to Lake Titicaca. The Wariponcho and CRIDER2 varieties from the Sum agroecological zone surpassed the others in terms of proline content (0.64 and 0.55 mug/g, respectively), whereas the Kamiri variety from northern Bolivia had the lowest proline content (0.36 mug/g). The CRIDER2 and Wariponcho varieties showed good adaptability to the most adverse environmental conditions, whereas Salcedo INIA would have serious problems adapting to areas outside its agroecological lake zone. The results indicate that the level of proline in the tissue is controlled by environmental conditions.

Lamadi village located along Speke Gulf of Lake Victoria was chosen. The main far-Ming systems in the area are agriculture, agro-pastoralism, and pastoralism. The wetlands are heavily used for livestock grazing during the dry season. Since 1990s the area has been experiencing a high influx of immigrant pastoral herds from drought prone districts. The increasing livestock numbers have led into serious degradation of wetlands. The type of damages includes: soil erosion, loss of vegetation cover and deforestation. This lead to pollution of Lake Victoria along the Speke gulf in particular as the wetlands was buffering a lot of pollutants from the catchments. The range condition at Lamadi was rated fair. The carrying capacity of rangelands was estimated at 3.57-6.75 ha/LU and the wetlands were seriously degraded causing heavy soil erosion and environmental pollution during rainy season. It was recommended to raise people's awareness on conservation of environment and mobilise communities to take responsibility on management of the environmental resources. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, it is necessary to monitor the variation of water storage in reservoirs within the region. We propose new methods of estimating water storage in reservoirs from satellite observations and digitized topographic data. These methods are applied to the Volta Lake of the Akosombo dam in Ghana. In this application, seasonal and inter-annual variations of reservoir storage are estimated, and the possibility of monitoring water storage is demonstrated.

Statistically significant (log-likelihood statistics, p < 0.05) differences were found in the proportions of pikeperch feeding on different fish species at different seasons and at various weights. The differences among the two sampling years were found non-significant. The proportion of pikeperch feeding on perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) increased as the abundance of perch increased in the sampling area. It can be concluded that pikeperch are positively selective for perch. The logistic approach was found useful in order to analyse the feeding pattern of pikeperch.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1996	33	3-4					481	487																WOS:A1996WB44500025

On September 18, small amounts of Crater Lake water were ejected, which mobilized large amounts of snow, This was because unstable seasonal snow pack was present in the lahar flow path. Five days later, a larger volume of water,vas ejected but proportionally less snow was mobilized, Beyond the volcanic cone, the initially homogenized snow slurries segregated into watery flows with a floating snow-slurry cap. Frozen deposits were emplaced as far as 45 km from the source and 1840 m lower in altitude, More than 50% of the sediment within the flow was derived from the initial eruption; the remainder was entrained before it reached 9.5 km. Beyond 9.5 km from the source, the flows progressively lost their gravel and sand.					; Neall, Vincent/NFT-6307-2025; Cronin, Shane/AAC-9964-2020	Cronin, Shane/0000-0001-7499-603X; 													0091-7613					DEC	1996	24	12					1107	1110		10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<1107:USSLFR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<1107:USSLFR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1996VZ94200013

COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE OF ZOOPLANKTON IN KARDZHALY RESERVOIR	BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												The zooplankton community structure in "Kardzhaly" reservoir (South-East Bulgaria) was studied from July 2000 to November 2002. The seasonal cycles and population dynamics of the main taxonomic groups are described and discussed. The zooplankton community was composed of 12 species of Rotifera, 13 species of Cladocera, 7 species of Copepoda, 1 species of Ostracoda, 1 species of Cnidaria (Coelenterata), 1 species of Hydracarina and 1 species of Ciliata. The abundance of the zooplankton increases, 5 times on average, between the limnetic and the riverine zone of the reservoir. The Copepoda dominated the limnetic zone, closely followed by Cladocera, while in the transitional and the riverine zones the opposite was true. The zooplankton community was mostly crustacean, with the following perennial species: Kellicottia longispina and Keratella cochlearis from the Rotifera; Daphnia longispina, Bosmina longirostris and Bosmina coregoni from the Cladocera, as well as Cyclops vicinus, Eudiaptomus gracilis and the nauplii and copepodites of the Copepoda. Some relationships were found between the trophic state, the reservoir exploitation and the zooplankton community.

J	Kuusipalo, L; Käkelä, R				Kuusipalo, L; Käkelä, R			Muscle fatty acids as indicators of niche and habitat in Malawian cichlids	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Fatty acid composition in the muscle of eight endemic haplochromine cichlids and one tilapiine cichlid from Lake Malawi was studied by gas-liquid chromatography. The species studied represent a wide variety of niches: Algae combing, shell crushing, feeding on littoral and semipelagic zooplankton, detecting invertebrates hidden in the sediment using expanded lateral line canals, and fish predation in littoral and bathypelagic zones. The sampling was done during the early rainy season. The analysis of fatty acid composition suggests that, despite the reported plasticity in feeding, the niches of the species studied are established and stable. The proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) in relation to arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) illustrated the position of these species in the foodweb: equal proportions in algae feeders and clear 20: 4n-6 dominance in species feeding on benthic prey. Although the number of replicates was small, discriminant analysis with 31 fatty acids separated the specimens into dense centers according to species. These results encourage the use of chemometric methods for studying ecological relationships among freshwater fauna and ongoing evolutionary processes.					; Kakela, Reijo/ONJ-2884-2025	Kuusipalo, Liisa/0000-0002-3889-1502; 													0024-3590					JUN	2000	45	4					996	1000		10.4319/lo.2000.45.4.0996	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.4.0996													WOS:000087558900024
J	Stewart, J; Kennelly, SJ				Stewart, J; Kennelly, SJ			Growth of the scyllarid lobsters Ibacus peronii and I-chacei	MARINE BIOLOGY												The growth rates of the morphologically similar scyllarid lobsters Ibacus peronii (Leach, 1815) and I. chacei (Brown and Holthuis, 1998) are described using data from a tag/recapture study and from tagged lobsters kept in captivity. Within particular size classes, we found no differences in moult increments between male and female I. peronii nor between male and female I. chacei. Small individuals of both species always had larger moult increments than larger individuals. For I. peronii, females moulted more frequently than males, and smaller size classes moulted more frequently than larger size classes. Female I. peronii therefore grew more quickly than males and reached their estimated size at sexual maturity (51 mm carapace length) after similar to 2 yr. Moulting of I. peronii was seasonal, with most lobsters (96.3%) moulting between October and January. We found no differences in growth rates of I. peronii at two locations along the east coast of Australia: Coffs Harbour in New South Wales (30 degrees 18'S; 153 degrees 08'E), and Lakes Entrance in Victoria (37 degrees 53'51 148 degrees 00'E). For I. chacei, we found no differences in the frequency of moulting between males and females and, because we also found no differences in the moult increments between males and females, the growth rates of both sexes were the same.																			0025-3162					JUN	2000	136	5					921	930		10.1007/s002270000272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002270000272													WOS:000088186100018
J	Mallet, C; Debroas, D				Mallet, C; Debroas, D			Relations between organic matter and bacterial proteolytic activity in sediment surface layers of a eutrophic lake (Lake Aydat, Puy de Dome, France)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Seasonal changes in Leucine-aminopeptidase activity in surface layers of anoxic sediment rich in organic matter were studied from July to October 1997 in a eutrophic lake. The mean bacterial density varied between, 119 +/- 20 109 cells/g DS with a biomass of 14 +/- 3 mgC/g DS. The average Leucine-aminopeptidase activity was 487 +/- 177 nmole h(-1) g(-1) DS over the entire sampling period. It consisted almost entirely of serine and cysteine proteases which had a pH optimum between 8 and 9 and an optimal temperature between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C. In order to study which factors determine this activity, the inputs of organic matter from the trophogenic zone and the concentrations of dissolved proteins and carbohydrates in the sediment were measured. The Leucine-aminopeptidase activity seemed to be repressed by organic matter (OM) flow (r = -0.575, P<0.05) and by carbohydrates (r = -0.684, P<0.05), and induced by dissolved proteins (r = 0.633, P<0.01) throughout the study period.

Although this species is also the main vector of west equine encephalitis in Argentina, little is known about the factors affecting its population dynamics, as it is difficult to obtain data on its abundance over a large area. However, the results of intensive study of the mosquito in a few sites might reasonably be extrapolated to a regional scale by the use of remotely sensed data. The adult, larval and pupal stages of Ae. albifasciatus were sampled at five field sites to the south of Mar Chiquita Lake, either once a month (during the dry, cold season) or once a fortnight (during the warm, rainy season), between August 1992 and April 1993. The measured abundance of adults or pre-adults and a meteorological coefficient useful for the estimation of larval abundance each showed significant correlation with various statistics derived from normalized-difference, vegetation indices (NDVI) calculated from satellite (NOAA-AVHRR) imagery. A linear discriminant analysis, using data on NDVI, rainfall and temperature, accurately identified periods with and without pre-adults. The satellite imagery was also useful in the estimation of larval abundance and consequently could be used to predict adult abundance 7 days in advance. Even though the satellite data employed have poor spatial resolution, their high temporal resolution makes them very useful in studies of the population dynamics of mosquitoes in general, at least once the relevant variables and their relationships with mosquito breeding and survival have been identified.					; Gorla, David/AAX-3360-2020	Gorla, David/0000-0002-9323-9365; 													0003-4983					DEC	1997	91	8					917	926		10.1080/00034983.1997.11813219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00034983.1997.11813219								9579211					WOS:000071067600003

MUD VISCOELASTIC PROPERTIES	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A small-strain theological model has been developed to characterize the complex equivalent viscosity in the equation of mud motion due to water waves. The dynamic viscosity and the shear moduli of elasticity in this model are determined from creep and dynamic shear tests in a controlled-stress rheometer, and their dependence on the forcing stress amplitude, frequency and the solids volume fraction is examined For a comparative evaluation of mud theology, the model has been applied to mud samples obtained from the southwest coast of India, Lake Okeechobee in Florida and Mobile Bay in Alabama, and to an aqueous clay mixture. In each case within the measured stress amplitude range, the viscoelastic coefficients are found to depend significantly on the forcing frequency, for a given solids volume fraction. The India mud is found to ha the most viscous of those tested This high viscosity results in very high rates of wave energy dissipation off the mast of Kerala during the monsoon season.																			0749-0208					SUM	1995	11	3					918	926																WOS:A1995RN67000032
J	Morin, J; Leclerc, M				Morin, J; Leclerc, M			From pristine to present state: hydrology evolution of Lake Saint-Francois, St. Lawrence River	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												Lake Saint-Francois is a relatively shallow fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River with numerous deep channels. This complex system has been considerably altered from its pristine state 150 years ago. Currently the water level is stabilized and the flow is regulated; important areas have been dredged and the major part of its outflow is diverted through the Beauharnois canal. The evolution of water levels shows a trend towards stabilization as required for ship traffic in the St. Lawrence Seaway and for hydropower production. With the construction of the Moses Saunders dam in 1960, the now of the river could be regulated; changes occur in the seasonal pattern of the flow. Ancient stage-discharge relationships were recreated to describe the impact of the 1849 damming and of the present level stabilization. Stabilization of the water level has favored the growth of submerged plants. Manning's friction coefficient was used to show that plant biomass has doubled since 1920; the onset of biomass increases corresponds to a water level stabilization event. The distribution of wetlands in the Lake Saint-Francois area was drastically modified by the water level rise caused by the 1849 damming. New wetlands were created and pre-1849 wetlands, located on what are currently shoals in the central part of the lake, have totally disappeared.																			0315-1468	1208-6029				OCT	1998	25	5					864	879		10.1139/cjce-25-5-864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjce-25-5-864													WOS:000165530900006

Organisms capable of asexual reproduction often maintain substantial clonal diversity within their populations. We ask whether such diversity in Daphnia pulicaria populations is maintained by temporal and spatial variation in selection. 2. We monitored temporal and spatial variation in the relative abundance of electrophoretically determined clonal groups in three lake populations of D. pulicaria from April to October 1991. 3. Clonal composition differed among lakes, but within each population we observed strong temporal changes in the relative abundance of different clonal groups. The timing and rate of this clonal succession was associated with the rate of loss of deep water habitat from seasonal anoxia. 4. Within each lake, clonal groups also segregated vertically into shallow and deep water assemblages. The magnitude of this habitat segregation varied temporally and was associated with the abundance of a shallow water competitor species, D. galeata. 5. We suggest that strong associations of clonal succession and clonal habitat segregation with environmental changes (habitat availability and competitor abundance) indicate selection operating on the clonal composition of these populations.																			0269-8463	1365-2435				OCT	1996	10	5					613	621		10.2307/2390171	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2390171													WOS:A1996WC88000007

The annual fluctuation in density, breeding activity, age structure, and sex ratio from all populations combined was similar to populations studied previously in central Panama. Densities were lowest at the beginning of the rainy season and peaked in the late rainy season. Breading occurred all year, but the number of births was greatest in April. The proportion of adults peaked in mid-dry f season and was lowest in mid-rainy season. 3. Each separate population also showed distinct fluctuations, but the timing of peaks and lows varied among populations. Density peaked during any month from April through December, and each population had a period of reproductive quiescence when no births occurred. The length of the breeding season varied from 4 to 11 months. Only the proportion of adults showed a high degree of synchrony among populations. 4.

By using fuzzing mathematics, this paper studied the grades the wetland functions and calculated their index values. By this quantitative method and based on the function index values, we analyzed the wetland function degradation and calculated the water quantity required to meet different functional needs in each season... Here we put forth three graded restoration schemes by integrating the ecological water requirement of different grades with the ecological restoration including water replenishing, water consumption and water pollution. According to the calculated model, the water level and water quantity for the low scheme are 1414.53 m and 1.30x10(8) m(3) respectively; 1415.38 m and 1.78x10(8) m(3) for the middle sheme, and 416.87 m and 2.14x10(8) m(3) for the high scheme.																			1001-6538	1861-9541				NOV	2006	51			S			127	135		10.1007/s11434-006-8127-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-006-8127-x													WOS:000242719500015

We hypothesized that availability of trout influenced all of these factors for bears in a large part of the Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery area. Depending upon sex, bears that fed on trout used 30-45% of the recovery area. These bears concentrated within 12 km of spawning streams year-round and within 2 km of streams during the spawning season, 1 May - 15 July, when trout-eating bears mostly consumed trout. Despite use of this high-quality food, trout-eating females were apparently less fecund than other females and lost a larger percentage of their dependent young. We speculate that these cub losses resulted from higher rates of intraspecific predation by bears aggregated at spawning streams. These aggregated bears were also vulnerable to human-caused mortality, most likely due to concentrations of humans within 2 km of spawning streams during the spawning season.																			0008-4301					NOV	1995	73	11					2072	2079		10.1139/z95-244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z95-244													WOS:A1995TQ06300013

J	COHEN, AS; HALFPENNY, J; LOCKLEY, M; MICHEL, E				COHEN, AS; HALFPENNY, J; LOCKLEY, M; MICHEL, E			MODERN VERTEBRATE TRACKS FROM LAKE MANYARA, TANZANIA AND THEIR PALEOBIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS	PALEOBIOLOGY												We studied mammal and bird track formation at the northern edge of Lake Manyara, Tanzania, to develop models for interpreting fossil tracks and trackways. Lake Manyara is a closed-basin, alkaline lake in the East African Rift System. The area has a high vertebrate diversity, allowing us to investigate tracks in an environment similar to that of many ancient track-bearing sequences. Three study sites, two on mud flats adjacent to the lake margin and a third on a delta floodplain, provided contrasting environments in which to assess the types of biological data that can potentially be extracted from fossil trackways. Our censuses of mammals and their tracks revealed that most species that occur within the study area leave a track record, and that common species leave abundant tracks, although numbers of trackways are not proportional to numbers of individuals. Logarithmic increases in track sampling area yield a linear increase in the proportion of both the medium and large-sized local mammals represented in a track record. Transect vs. area mapping methods produced different censusing results, probably because of differences in monitoring periods and areal coverage. We developed a model of expected track production rates that incorporates activity budget and stride length data in addition to abundance data. By using these additional variables in a study of diurnal birds, we obtained a much better estimator relating track abundance to trackmaker abundance than that provided by census data alone. Proportions of different types of tracks predicted by the model differ significantly from the observed proportions, almost certainly because of microenvironmental differences between the censusing and track counting localities. Censuses of fossil tracks will be biased toward greater numbers of depositional-environment generalists and away from habitat-specific species. Trackways of migratory animals were dominantly shoreline-parallel, whereas trackways of sedentary species were more variable. A strong shoreline-parallel environmental zonation at the Alkaline Flats site exerted an influence on trackmaker distribution patterns, initial track formation, and track preservation. Variations in habitat usage by different species, as well as species abundance and directionality of movement, were all important in determining the number of preservable tracks a species produced within a given environmental zone. Fossil trackways are time-averaged, although over entirely different temporal scales than are bones. Unlike bones, tracks are not space-averaged. Therefore, wherever possible, fossil track and bone studies should be used to complement each other, as they provide fundamentally different pictures of paleocommunities. Tracks provide ''snapshot'' views of localized assemblages of organisms useful in reconstructing autecological relationships, whereas bones yield a broader image of a local fauna in which seasonal and microenvironmental variation are more commonly smoothed out.

J	Howard, A				Howard, A			Modeling movement patterns of the cyanobacterium, Microcystis	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												This paper reports the development of a model that simulates the movement and growth of the cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa. The new model follows from the approach taken in the SCUM'96 (simulation of cyanobacterial underwater movement) model by calculating the photosynthetic production of carbohydrate, allocating this to growth and cell maintenance with excess production forming cellular ballast. From this, density change is calculated and vertical migration simulated within the water column. Lake heating and cooling, turbulent mixing, and other environmental processes are simulated to study the response of cyanobacteria to environmental variability. The model can be run over long periods for areas of different geographical latitude. Model output compares well with field observations suggesting that surface "bloom" formation is a natural consequence of lake mixing and seasonal light availability.

Contributing to fill this gap, we present a first approach to discriminate and characterize the depositional systems of the late Eocene Yolomecatl Formation, which fills the namesake, triangle-shaped tectonic basin, and carries the southernmost Paleogene vertebrate fauna of North America. The study area lies between 17 degrees 25'-17 degrees 30' North Latitude and 97 degrees 29'-97 degrees 36' West Longitude, and between 2000-2500 ma.s.l.; the federal highway 125 traverses it; Santiago Yolomecatl is the main town. The Yolomecatl Formation is at least 650 m thick, although the continuous thickness measured in the principal reference section is much less (similar to 250 m); it includes fluvial and lake depositional systems sparsely interbedded by tuff sheets (a system per se). The fluvial system consists of 1) Gmm, Gmg, Gcm lithofacies: alluvial fans and related deposits; 2) Gm, Gh, Gp, Gt, St, Sp lithofacies: channel lag deposits; 3) Sr, Sh, Sl, Fl lithofacies: floodplain deposits. The (clastic) lacustrine system includes: 1) Ll, Lsm, Lm lithofacies: offshore deposits; 2) Ll, Lsm lithofacies: playa lake and mud flats deposits. This large thickness of this unit indicates superposition of fluvial/lacustrine systems, and sparse pyroclastic emplacements that took place in a basin gradually subsiding with sedimentation, under humid to subhumid conditions, probably interrupted by seasonal dryness. Finally, the tectonic setting of the Yolomecatl Basin, indicates that its genesis and development are related to the dynamics of the regional, left-lateral strike-slip Tamazulapam fault, which is also regarded as the boundary between the Mixteca (west) and Oaxaca (east) terranes.

J	Reche, I; Carrillo, P; CruzPizarro, L				Reche, I; Carrillo, P; CruzPizarro, L			Influence of metazooplankton on interactions of bacteria and phytoplankton in an oligotrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Commensalism based on organic carbon supplied by phytoplankton and competition for mineral nutrients are important interactions between bacteria and phytoplankton in oligotrophic clear-water systems. Both interactions are influenced by zooplankton activity. To examine the relationship between algae and bacteria in Lake La Caldera, we studied: the correlations among phytoplankton, bacteria and phosphorus (P) dynamics; the ratio of organic carbon supplied by algae to organic carbon demand by bacteria; and the importance of P remineralized by metazooplankton for both communities. Phytoplankton and bacteria had a similar seasonal dynamics, and there was a significant and positive relationship between bacterial abundance and algal biomass (P < 0.01). However, the release of organic carbon from phytoplankton was usually higher than the bacterioplankton carbon requirement. P available via zooplankton remineralization satisfied between 74 and 316% of the minimum P demands of algae and bacteria. To elucidate whether zooplankton operate similarly on algae and bacterial growth or indirectly influence bacterial growth through phytoplankton metabolism, we performed zooplankton manipulation experiments. High zooplankton biomass in these experiments stimulated both primary and bacterial production, but release of organic carbon from phytoplankton declined. These results suggest a direct stimulus of bacterial growth, so algae and bacteria can balance grazing losses by compensatory growth. Further, the algal decrease of the organic carbon supply for bacteria could, over time, lead to a change in the algae-bacteria interaction from competition to commensalism. This reduction in organic carbon excretion could affect the balance of the competitive interaction.

Surges of adult population abundance during the rainy season are a nuisance, affecting milk and beef production. Larvae develop in short periods in shallow temporary ground pools on fresh or brackish water. Although adults seem to disperse long distances from larval habitats, little is known about their habitat preferences. This work studied factors affecting the spatial pattern of adult Oc. albifasciatus abundance. Adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC miniature light traps baited with CO2 at 28 sites located to the south of Mar Chiquita Lagoon, from November 1997 to April 1998. Each site was typified according to its predominating vegetation cover, potential breeding site occurrence, land slope and cattle density. The spatial and temporal patterns of abundance suggested that Oc. albifasciatus prefers prairies and natural grasslands subject to periodic flooding vs. woodland and farm land. A discriminant function based on the proximity to potential larval habitats, distance to woodland and land slope accurately classified 95% of the data categorized as having an average high (>500 mosquitoes) or low (<500 mosquitoes) abundance, and was validated using six sites located away from the study area. An analysis of the temporal variation of mosquito abundance highlighted the influence of the dynamics of the larval habitats on adult mosquito abundance.

Nitrogenase activity, measured as the acetylene-reducing activity (ARA), was estimated in situ during different intervals of the cropping period. At the same time, physical and chemical variables and cyanobacterial occurrence were determined in water and soil. Nitrogen fixation was measurable at all sampling sites, being higher in July and lower in Tune after a short dry period. The ARA values ranged from 0.23 to 75.5 kg N Na-1 year(-1). Because blooms or other conspicuous cyanobacterial forms were not included in the measurements, maximum rates of nitrogen fixation may have been higher. Environmental variables that correlated with ARA varied on a seasonal basis. Water properties such as calcium, hardness, or conductivity, and soil properties such as conductivity and sodium correlated positively with N-2 fixation; however, nutrient parameters such as dissolved inorganic nitrogen or soluble reactive phosphorus were negatively correlated Cyanobacterial abundance, in general, did not correlate with ARA. The overall conclusion is that nitrogen fixation may be an important N input in the N cycle of rice fields, and could lessen pollution problems by lowering the demand for chemical fertilizers.

J	Walker, WW Jr				Walker, WW Jr			Consideration of variability and uncertainty in phosphorus total maximum daily loads for lakes	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												A simplified framework for considering variability and uncertainty in developing lake phosphorus total maximum daily, loads (TMDLs) is demonstrated. Explicit consideration of these factors can increase the probability that TMDL implementation will meet a defined water quality goal at an acceptable frequency. Although a lake goal is typically expressed as a seasonal or yearly average phosphorus concentration, effects of temporal variations can be captured by correlating average phosphorus concentrations with the frequency of algal blooms (defined by extreme values of chlorophyll a) or the frequency, of exceeding numeric water quality standards that are directly linked to algal blooms, such as hydrogen ion concentration or transparency. The margin of safety (MOS) required to achieve the lake goal at a defined frequency and with a defined confidence level can be estimated by including stochastic terms in the phosphorus balance equation to reflect variability and uncertainty. Given limitations in the data and models typically used in developing TMDLs, the cost of the MOS, expressed in terms of percent of the total allocated load or safety factors in the design of control measures, can be large. The MOS would be expected to increase with the percent load reduction required under the TMDL, as the forecast loads become increasingly dependent on assumptions regarding the performance of best management practices or other measures for reducing loads. The magnitude and cost of the MOS can be reduced by implementing TMDLs in an iterative fashion with ongoing data collection, and, model refinement to reduce uncertainties associated with forecasting the performance of phosphorus load controls and lake responses.																			0733-9496	1943-5452				JUL-AUG	2003	129	4					337	344		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2003)129:4(337)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2003)129:4(337)													WOS:000183658100011

Coupling of heterotrophic bacteria to phytoplankton bloom development at different pCO2 levels: a mesocosm study	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The predicted rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions will increase CO2 concentrations and decrease seawater pH in the upper ocean. Recent studies have revealed effects of pCO(2) induced changes in seawater chemistry on a variety of marine life forms, in particular calcifying organisms. To test whether the predicted increase in pCO(2) will directly or indirectly (via changes in phytoplankton dynamics) affect abundance, activities, and community composition of heterotrophic bacteria during phytoplankton bloom development, we have aerated mesocosms with CO2 to obtain triplicates with three different partial pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)): 350 mu atm (1 x CO2), 700 mu atm (2 x CO2) and 1050 mu atm (3 x CO2). The development of a phytoplankton bloom was initiated by the addition of nitrate and phosphate. In accordance to an elevated carbon to nitrogen drawdown at increasing pCO(2), bacterial production (BPP) of free-living and attached bacteria as well as cellspecific BPP (csBPP) of attached bacteria were related to the C:N ratio of suspended matter. These relationships significantly differed among treatments. However, bacterial abundance and activities were not statistically different among treatments. Solely community structure of free-living bacteria changed with pCO(2) whereas that of attached bacteria seemed to be independent of pCO(2) but tightly coupled to phytoplankton bloom development. Our findings imply that changes in pCO(2), although reflected by changes in community structure of free-living bacteria, do not directly affect bacterial activity. Furthermore, bacterial activity and dynamics of heterotrophic bacteria, especially of attached bacteria, were tightly correlated to phytoplankton development and, hence, may also potentially depend on changes in pCO(2).

It has the very important role of flood control, generation and shipping. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake of china. It has the natural role of regulating Yangtze River's water. It also provides a very good natural condition for the development of regional economic. This paper establishes the relationship between Yichang's water level, Five River's water level and Hukou's water level by using ANFIS. It identifies the influence degree of Hukou's water level after the running of Three Gorges. The result shows that after the running of Three Gorges, the water level in flood season of Poyang Lake is increased, so Poyang Lake's flood control pressure is increased. And it decreases the water level of Poyang Lake's dry season; this brings great influence to the development and utilization of Poyang Lake's water resource.

Utilization of Kaiser's Varimax orthogonal rotation led to the delineation of six contiguous subregions or ''influence regimes'' which together accounted for 64.02% of the total variance. Each subregion displayed statistically unique O-3 characteristics and corresponded well with the path and frequency of anticyclones. When compared to the entire domain, the mid-Atlantic and south subregions observe higher mean daily 1-h maximum concentrations. Concentrations are near the domain average for the northeast and southwest subregions and are lowest in the Great Lakes and Florida subregions. The percentage of observations exceeding 120 ppb were greatest in the mid-Atlantic and southwest subregions, near the domain average in the northeast and south subregions, and lowest in the Great Lakes and Florida subregions. Examination of the time series of the principal component scores associated with the subregions indicated that Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic subregions tend to observe a stronger seasonal cycle, with maximum concentrations occurring during the last week in June and first week in July, respectively. The strength of this seasonality is weakened for the northeast and south subregions and its timing delayed, until the end of July and the first of August, respectively. The southwest subregion experiences a greatly diminished seasonality, with maximum concentrations delayed until the middle of August. The seasonality found in the Florida subregion is unique in both its strength and timing, as the highest concentrations consistently occur during the months of April and May, The time series were then deseasonalized and autocorrelations and spectral density estimates calculated, revealing that persistence is much more prevalent in the Florida (autocorrelation significant to a lag of 4 days), south (3 days) and southwest (3 days) subregions. Conversely, autocorrelations are only significant to a lag of one day in the northeast and two days for the Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic subregions.																			0004-6981					NOV	1993	27	16					2645	2668		10.1016/0960-1686(93)90035-W	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(93)90035-W													WOS:A1993MJ81600019

Multivariate methods were used to partition the variability in a spatio-temporal species dataset (12 sampling depths, 19 dates, 6 species) into pure spatial, temporal, environmental and shared components. Using this approach, 51 % of the variation of the zooplankton community could be explained. Broad-scale spatial organization in the zooplankton community (i.e. water column scale variation that Could be explained as a simple first-order function of depth) accounted for 23 % of the explained variation. Approximately half of this variation was shared with depth-wise variations in water temperature variables. Due to the discontinuity of the thermally stratified water Column, there existed a component of the shared variation between water temperature variables and zooplankton community structure that could not be explained by a simple first-order function of depth. By statistically modelling the discontinuous nature of the thermally stratified water column For a series of discrete time periods, thermocline position was found to explain between 9 and 22% of the total variation in community structure. This indicated that spatial variations in the community composition included a discontinuous component, that coincided with the thermocline.

J	Abrahamsson, O; Håkanson, L				Abrahamsson, O; Håkanson, L			Modelling seasonal flow variability of European rivers	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												River discharge influences many important processes in a lake ecosystem. For example, the tributary discharge is one of the major regulating factors for the lake water retention time and, hence, the retention of substances in lake water. However, river discharge depends on many more or less stochastic processes, which makes it difficult to give a reliable prediction of the discharge for a specific river at a given time. This paper presents an attempt to overcome many of those difficulties with a simple mathematical model. The model was designed to meet some specific demands for ecosystem modelling of contaminating substances. The most important of those requirements is that the model had to be based on readily available driving variables, preferably from standard maps. The presented results are based on extensive calibrations and validations using empirical data on monthly water discharge from more than 200 European rivers. It may be concluded that this model yields predictions that capture the essential components in mean monthly variations in river discharge in European rivers and that this model is driven by easily available driving variables like catchment area, mean annual precipitation, altitude, and latitude. The technique to obtain seasonal variability is based on calibrated 'norms' and smoothing functions defined from the driving variables. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The seasonal dynamics of its diet was revealed. The data on the diet obtained for the lake nesting and coastal nesting populations are compared. Typical slaty-backed gull colonies are situated 3 km from the sea; they use the following foraging strategies: (1) foraging near colony; (2) Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus) preference; and (3) feeding in the littoral zone. Red salmon is the basic component of the gull trophic chain. The seasonal changes in the foraging strategies were observed in slaty-backed gulls on Kuril'skoe Lake related to the condition of the forage reserve. Foraging flights of gulls for red salmon didn't exceed 5 km, while the use of littoral food was minimal In addition, red salmon gurry was also the mass food for gullies, which was collected at a distance of about 40 km from the colony.

J	Medina, G				Medina, G			Seasonal variations and changes in the diet of southern river otter in different freshwater habitats in Chile	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												The diet of southern river otter Lutra provocax Thomas, 1908 was determined from 605 seats collected from four sites in Southern Chile between 1990-1991. Crustacean remains were the most common item found in seats. Crustacean species that were the most common in seats collected from lakes, became less important in the river outlets. Fish remains were all from fish less than 100 mm in length and were found more frequently in seats collected at the river sites than at the lake sites. Differences in the diet between otter's seats collected in lakes and their river outlets may be related to prey availability and vulnerability. Diet was more diverse in river habitats than in the lakes. The diet of southern river otter appears to be closer to that described for Aonyx capensis and Lutra maculicollis in South Africa. The southern river otter is heavily dependent on the abundance of three crustacean species. Differences in the diets observed between lake and their river outlets suggest important differences in habitat conditions. This may have future implications for prioritising habitat protection in the conservation of southern river otter.

The CH4 production rates increased during the year from about 5 mmol m-2d-1 in December to a maximum of about 95 mmol m-2d-1 in September. CH4 production rates showed a temperature optimum at 30-degrees-C and an apparent activation energy of 76 kJ mol-1. A large part of the seasonality of CH4 production could be ascribed to the change of the sediment temperature. Most of the produced CH4 was lost by ebullition. Gas bubbles contained about 60-70% CH4 with an average deltaC-13 of -56.2 parts per thousand and deltaD of -354 parts per thousand, and 2% CO2 with an average deltaC-13 of -14.1 parts per thousand indicating that CH4 was produced from methyl carbon, i.e. mainly using acetate as methanogenic substrate. This result was confirmed by inhibition of methanogenesis with chloroform which resulted in an accumulation rate of acetate equivalent to 81% of the rate of CH4 production. Most probable numbers of methanogenic bacteria were in the order of 10(4) bacteria g-1d.w. sediment for acetate-, methanol- or formate-utilizing, and of 10(5) for H-2-utilizing methanogens. The turnover times of acetate were in the order of 2.3-4.8 h which, with in situ acetate concentrations of about 25-50 muM, resulted in rates of acetate turnover which were comparable to the rates of CH4 production. The respiratory index (RI) showed that [2-C-14]acetate was mainly used by methanogenesis rather than by respiratory processes, although the zone of CH4 production in the sediment overlapped with the zone of sulfate reduction.																			0168-6496					APR	1993	102	3-4					279	289		10.1111/j.1574-6968.1993.tb05819.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.1993.tb05819.x													WOS:A1993KY71600015

A total of 120 samples representing each of the four seasons was collected between 01.01.1994 and 01.01.1995. The organic parts of the samples were ashed with a mixture of magnesium oxide and magnesium nitrate according to the dry ashing method and arsenic residues were measured by silver diethyldithyocarbamate in UV spectrophotometer; copper, cadmium, zinc and lead levels were also determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. In the analysis of the 120 samples for residues of heavy mettals, the average values were found to be: 1.43+/-0.81 ppm for lead, 0.09+/-0.02 ppm for cadmium, 5.83+/-0.73 ppm for copper, 15.93+/-3.26 ppm for zinc and 0.06+/-0.05 ppm for arsenic. Evaluation of the study results showed that these heavy metal levels were within the normal ranges for our country and other country's acceptable limits.

Given the ecological requirements for sexual reproduction known for modem L. papulosum, the fossils attest to a submersion period of at least three months at a salinity range of 20 parts per thousand to 40 parts per thousand. Thus the fossil populations were formed during a period of low salinities in what are present-day sebkhas. The geographical and geological position of the finds, overlying the Precambrian substrate with a low hydrological potential, strongly suggests that the formation of paleolakes in these areas resulted from increased and seasonal rainfall probably correlated with the Nouakchottian humid period ranging from 7000 to 4000 BP.

The Cd concentration in mussels exposed in the river Rhine has decreased from 74 mg kg-1 in 1976 to 1.5 mg kg-1 in 1988. In the river Meuse, however, the Cd concentration in Dreissena polymorpha has increased from 6 mg/kg-1 to 22 mg kg-1. Cu concentrations in mussels have not changed. Comparison of heavy metal concentrations in mussels from Lake Heerhugowaard, Lake Markermeer, Lake Maarsseveen and the rive Dieze demonstrated that background concentrations for Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in Dreissena polymorpha are about 12, 110, 1 and 0.5 mg kg-1, respectively. Mussels from these four locations showed seasonal variation in heavy metal concentrations. This may be caused by both changes in the bioavailability of the metals and by the annual growth and reproductive cycle of the mussels. Therefore, one should take care that animals are collected at the same location and in the same season in long-term active biological monitoring programs.

J	Kern, J; Darwich, A; Furch, K; Junk, WJ				Kern, J; Darwich, A; Furch, K; Junk, WJ			Seasonal denitrification in flooded and exposed sediments from the Amazon floodplain at Lago Camaleao	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Denitrification processes were measured by the acetylene-blockage technique under changing flood conditions along the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone on the Amazon floodplain at Lago Camaleao, near Manaus, Brazil. In flooded sediments, denitrification was recorded after the amendment with NO3- (100 mu mol liter(-1)) throughout the whole study period from August 1992 to February 1993. It ranged from 192.3 to 640.7 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) in the 0- to 5-cm sediment layer. Without substrate amendment, denitrification was detected only during low water in November and December 1992, when it occurred at a rate of up to 12.2 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1). Higher rates of denitrification at an average rate of 73.3 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) were measured in sediments from the shallow lake basin that were exposed to air at low water. N2O evolution was never detected in flooded sediments, but in exposed sediments, it was detected at an average rate of 28.3 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) during the low-water period. The results indicate that under natural conditions there is denitrification and hence a loss in nitrogen from the Amazon floodplain to the atmosphere. Rates of denitrification in flooded sediments were one to two orders of magnitude smaller than in temperate regions. However, the nitrogen removal of exposed sediments exceeded that of undisturbed wetland soils of temperate regions, indicating a considerable impact of the flood pulse on the gaseous turnover of nitrogen in the Amazon floodplain.					; Junk, Wolfgang/A-6172-2017	Kern, Jurgen/0000-0001-7797-5226; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				JUL-AUG	1996	32	1					47	57											8661541					WOS:A1996UR43800005
J	Sommer, U				Sommer, U			Plankton ecology: The past two decades of progress	NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN												This is a selected account of recent developments in plankton ecology. The examples have been chosen for their degree of innovation during the past two decades and for their general ecological importance. They range from plankton autecology over interactions between populations to community ecology. The autecology of plankton is represented by the hydromechanics of plankton (the problem of life in a viscous environment) and by the nutritional ecology of phyto- and zooplankton. Population level studies are represented by competition, herbivory (grazing), and zooplankton responses to predation. Community ecology is represented by the debate about bottom-up vs. rep-down control of community organization, by the PEG model of seasonal plankton succession, and by the recent discovery of the microbial food web.																			0028-1042	1432-1904				JUL	1996	83	7					293	301		10.1007/s001140050291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s001140050291													WOS:A1996UZ01300001

SEBAL uses digital image data collected by Landsat or other remote-sensing satellites measuring thermal infrared radiation in addition to visible and near-infrared. SEBAL was originally developed in the Netherlands by Bastiaanssen and was modified during the Idaho study for application to mountainous terrain and clear, cold lakes. In an application to the Bear River Basin of southeastern Idaho, USA, ET was computed as a component of the surface energy balance on a pixel-by-pixel basis. ET for periods in between satellite overpasses was computed using ratios of ET from SEBAL to reference ET computed using data from from ground-based weather stations. These ratios were essentially customized "crop coefficients" that were determined uniquely for each pixel of an image. This initial application and testing of SEBAL in Idaho indicates substantial promise as an efficient, accurate, and inexpensive procedure to predict the actual evaporation fluxes from irrigated lands throughout a growing season. Predicted ET has been compared with ground measurements of ET by lysimeter with good results, with monthly differences averaging +/- 16%, but with seasonal differences of only 4% due to reduction in random error. ET maps via SEBAL provide the means to quantify, in terms of both the amount and spatial distribution, the ET on a field by field basis within each state. In particular, the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) will use results to predict total, net depletion of water from the Bear River system resulting from irrigation diversions.

Tributaries may transport about half of the loads into the lake. The contribution of diffuse sources may reach two thirds of the total load. Biweekly/monthly water quality monitoring on small inflows (0.01 m(3)/s-0.3 m(3)/s range) results in a high uncertainty of load estimates. This paper evaluates the degree of uncertainties by using analytical expressions of sampling theory. Load-flow relationships were derived for five streams and annual total phosphorus load was predicted by four load estimation methods. A seasonal regression model, based upon the evaluation of historical set of observed phosphorus loads, appeared best to refine load estimates on small inflows. Correction frequently led to load estimates that exceeded uncorrected loads by a factor of two to three. Since the dynamics of the watercourses determined the errors of load estimates, stratified sampling is needed to decrease the uncertainties.																			0273-1223						2001	43	7					279	286		10.2166/wst.2001.0436	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2001.0436								11385858					WOS:000169081600035

Stomach contents were collected without killing the animals. Fifteen prey categories including invertebrates and vertebrates were found in the stomachs. Snails (Pomatia spp.) and fish were the main items present in the diet. Snails were more abundant in the diet of juveniles and fish more abundant in that of adults. Frogs, birds, and mammals were also eaten. Results from both descriptive statistics and multivariare ordination analyses indicated that there was a significant effect of ontogeny on diet composition. There were also significant seasonal differences in diet composition, suggesting that in order to resist periods of food scarcity black caimans may adjust their feeding behavior according to changes in prey abundance and occurrence. Although black caimans are top predators, even adults apparently depend on both invertebrates and vertebrates to satisfy their energetic needs. Conservation of this heavily hunted species has to consider protection of natural areas such as lakes and rivers, principally those where a high diversity and abundance of organisms from various trophic levels occurs.

The lake was sampled from 2000 to 2015 in order to determine chlorophyll concentration, algae abundance and phytoplankton in vivo fluorescence as a way to evaluate the physiological state of algae. Development and physiological state of phytoplankton in different seasons was related to concentration and dynamics of nutrients in the lake. Laboratory experiments of Keratococcus rhaphidiodes to nitrogen (N) enrichment confirmed that an increase in nutrient content enabled a better physiological state of algae (e.g. higher chlorophyll per cell). Therefore, under the projected scenarios of climate change, the increase of available N through the increase in deposition and the increase of dissolved inorganic carbon, as consequence of higher atmospheric CO2, will compensate the natural nutrient constraints observed in the phytoplankton of the lake. The effect that the atmospheric CO2 has on the DIC, and this on algal development, as well as the influence that N has on algal growth, make Lake Caviahue an interesting sentinel of nutrient deposition at regional level.

J	Amarasinghe, PB; Vijverberg, J				Amarasinghe, PB; Vijverberg, J			Primary production in a tropical reservoir in Sri Lanka	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Primary production was measured every 2 weeks during 16 months (N = 33) in Tissawewa, a tropical shallow reservoir in the lowlands of south-east Sri Lanka. Results are interpreted in relation to selected environmental conditions such as oxygen concentrations, water temperature, Secchi-disc depth, wind force, conductivity, and morphoedaphic index and water level fluctuations. Because of regularly reoccurring high wind speeds the water column is well mixed. Daily gross primary production per unit area was plotted as a function of the algal biomass per unit area over the euphotic zone. Chlorophyll-a concentration in the euphotic zone was taken as measure for the algal biomass. The literature comparisons showed that the primary productivity in Tissawewa was in the same range as in 29 tropical lakes and reservoirs, of which 27 were from Africa. The productivity of these 30 tropical lakes and reservoirs was compared with: ( a) 27 lakes of which 25 were temperate lakes, and (b) 49 North American temperate lakes. Firstly, comparisons were made on an annual basis for the tropical water bodies, but restricted to May-September, the growing season, for temperate water bodies. The gross primary productivity of tropical water bodies was ca. three times higher than that of temperate water bodies. These differences were even more dramatic if the two geographical regions are compared on an annual basis, i.e. the tropical systems are ca. six times more productive than their temperate counterpart.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2002	487	1					85	93																WOS:000181732400006

The density and spatial extent of these aggregations varied among years, but one of the sites (Fuel Dump Point) was consistently separated from another major spawning area (Fuel Dump Bay) by at least 15 m of unused but generally similar habitat. Females settled first at the Point and this site supported higher spawner densities than the adjacent Bay. Male breeding opportunity, estimated from operational sex ratios, was higher in the Bay soon after spawning commenced. However, few males moved from the Point into the Bay and all movement that occurred was late in the season, when breeding opportunities for males were very limited. The reproductive success of males that moved from the Bay to the Point was estimated to be 0.003% of the total reproductive success of all males at the Point. The reproductive success of males that moved from the Point to the Bay was estimated to be 3% of the total reproductive success of all males at the Bay. Thus, spatial and temporal variation in settling largely isolated the two spawning aggregations within a breeding season. We suggest that variation in habitat quality may interact with the heritability of spawning date, contributing to the formation of distinct breeding groups.

S.; Alexander, Kathleen			Flooded area classification using pooled training samples: an example from the Chobe River Basin, Botswana	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												In dryland systems, the flood pulse is the driving force in system dynamics but is highly variable in flow volume and landscape inundation features. Remote sensing can provide critical information fundamental to evaluating and forecasting flow behavior and population vulnerability; however, training and classifying an extensive time series of images is labor intensive, limiting the usefulness of these approaches in evaluating flood pulse dynamics and landscape interactions. Here, we provide an alternative approach that relies on only one set of "pooled" training samples for time series image classification and analysis. We test this approach by mapping the flood pulse in a time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from the Chobe River Basin of Botswana for the years 2014 to 2016. MODIS MOD09A1 images collected during the flooding season (February to July) were converted to Kauth-Thomas components, then sampled to form a training pool. Images were then classified using these pooled training samples. Results indicated that classification accuracies obtained using pooled training were statistically indistinguishable from classifications obtained from conventional training. Application of the method to another year's data (2013) also yielded comparably accurate results, suggesting that the training pool method remains robust when applied to image data other than that used to create the training pool.

Temporal variation in surface albedo was determined using an extensive data set from six tower sites with multiple years of data. Four distinct patterns in evolution of the seasonal trend in daily albedo were discovered for the six sites and appeared to be related to vegetation and surface moisture characteristics. All sites showed an albedo response to solar zenith angles greater than 60 degrees, at smaller zenith angles hourly albedo was a good representation of daily values. TM imagery from a dry year (1984) and a wet year (1991) were used to derive maps of albedo for the study area. Spatial variation of albedo was examined within representative training areas centered on the six tower sites. The magnitude of spatial variation in albedo was typically less than 0.04 for all sites. Spatial variability was slightly greater in the wet year. A one pixel transect of albedo across the study area showed the largest difference between lakes and terrestrial surfaces. However, within the terrestrial zones, alternating patches of open forest and tundra and differences in wetness create a coherent pattern in albedo across the landscape.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													0004-0851					AUG	1997	29	3					261	269		10.2307/1552140	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552140													WOS:A1997XU11300001
J	Roe, SL; MacIsaac, HJ				Roe, SL; MacIsaac, HJ			Temporal variation of organochlorine contaminants in the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in Lake Erie	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are commonly employed as contaminant biomonitors in Europe and North America. Accumulation of hydrophobic, organochlorine contaminants into an organism depends, in part, on the organism's lipid content. In this study, we assess the influence of temporal variation in lipid content and reproductive activity on contaminant dynamics in zebra mussels collected from the western basin of Lake Erie. Mussels spawned twice during 1995, first in June and again in August. Lipid content of mussels was highest following the first spawning event and declined thereafter. Lipid-adjusted concentrations of moderately hydrophobic (mid-K-ow) compounds were much higher than those of either low or high hydrophobicity. Principal component analysis (PCA) of seasonal variation of concentrations of nine compounds revealed two primary axes, the first determined by mid-and high-K-ow compounds (PCBs 52, 101, 118, 153, 138 and 180), the latter by a low K-ow compound (hexachlorobenzene). A second principal component model separated physiological, environmental and temporal factors. Variation in mid- and high-K-ow compounds corresponded with precipitation and reproductive status of mussels. By contrast, variation in hexachlorobenzene concentration was associated with lipid content and reproductive cycle. Concentrations of all nine compounds did not differ significantly between gravid and laboratory-spawned mussels, indicating that the effect of reproduction may be decoupled from the actual spawning event, Concentrations did nt differ between spent male and female mussels. Examination of lipid composition revealed that neutral lipids comprise only 39% of total lipids in zebra mussels. Concentrations of PCBs with log K-ow > 5.71 were more highly correlated with neutral than with total lipid. content, indicating that concentration normalization on a neutral lipid basis may be more appropriate than adjustment based on total lipid. Results from this study indicate that reproductive status and lipid content affect contaminant dynamics in zebra mussels and that these factors require consideration when mussels are deployed as biomonitors.

This was done during the dry season (March-April, 2003) and wet season (June-July, 2002). Periphyton was allowed to grow on 24 artificial substrates set at equal distances in a 1000 m(2) pond. "Lab-lab" that colonized the artificial substrates and that on the pond surrounding the substrates were scraped off from a measured surface area. Simultaneously, water was collected for the analysis of physical, chemical and biological parameters. Sampling was done bi-weekly coinciding with 2 and 7 days submergence at a desired depth before adjusting the water level. The major algae consisted of the diatoms (Bacilliarophyta), the blue green algae (Cyanobacteria), and the green algae (Chlorophyta). The diatoms were dominant during the dry season while the cyanobacteria dominated during the wet season. Twenty eight genera were observed during the dry season and 25 genera were noted in the wet season. Variation in genera and density that were observed every sampling period, was influenced by environmental conditions and the incoming water.

Hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (mg L-1) explained 37% of the variance in PMB ((g m(-2))(0.1)) as a quadratic function, whereas water temperature (degrees C) explained 23% of variance in a linear relationship. 3. Ln contrast with other studies based on oligotrophic systems, indirect indicators of food availability (i.e. chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations and Secchi depth) were not significant predictors of PMB in this study. 4. The predictive power of our models may be improved by obtaining more frequent (seasonal) estimates of PMB and hypolimnetic DO concentration and by quantifying biotic factors such as competition, predation, life history phenologies and recruitment success.																			0046-5070					FEB	1999	41	1					91	100		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00392.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00392.x													WOS:000079427300007
J	Espie, RHM; James, PC; Brigham, RM				Espie, RHM; James, PC; Brigham, RM			The effects of flooding on piping plover Charadrius melodus reproductive success at Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan,Canada	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Up to 5% of the world piping plover Charadrius melodus population breed on the beaches of Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan so reproductive success there is likely important to the future prospects of this species. We collected data on nest initiation dates, nest elevations, hatching and hedging dates, survival rates of chicks and causes of mortality. Study sites were located on beaches where concentrations of plovers were found during the 1991 International Piping Plover Census. In 1992, plovers fledged a mean of 2.0 chicks per pair (n = 30), higher than the mean of 0.1 chicks per pair in 1993 (n = 39) and one of the highest recorded for the species. The major reason for this difference in hedging success between years was due to the loss of unhatched eggs by flooding. Using 1992 and 1993 nest site elevations and reproductive data, we developed a simulation model to assess the effects of flooding on piping plover reproductive success over the last 30 yr. Our model shows that fledging success at Lake Diefenbaker has been below the level recommended for sustainability of the species, in 24 of the last 30 yr. To maximize reproductive success at this location, we recommend that lake levels be managed to prevent or reduce flooding during the breeding season. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	MUNSON, AD; TIMMER, VR				MUNSON, AD; TIMMER, VR			SOIL-NITROGEN DYNAMICS AND NUTRITION OF PINE FOLLOWING SILVICULTURAL TREATMENTS IN BOREAL AND GREAT-LAKES ST-LAWRENCE PLANTATIONS	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Six years after establishment of a boreal forest plantation (Ontario, Canada), the impact of intensive silvicultural treatments on soil nitrogen (N) reserves, N availability and nutrition of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) was examined. Treatments of scarification (blade removal of entire forest floor), fertilizer application (annually) and vegetation control (annually for 4 years) were applied in a factorial design, and the site was subsequently planted to native conifer species. In the sixth season after transplanting, no significant impacts of treatments on total N reserves in the humus or surface mineral soil were noted. Scarification markedly reduced both soil ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) availability, especially early in the growing season. The positive effect of vegetation control on NH4-N and NO3-N availability was also significantly reduced by scarification. Vegetation control significantly increased NH4-N and NO3-N availability in the mid to late growing season, and highest levels of NO3-N (ten times greater than control) were noted with combined fertilization and vegetation control. We compared the nutritional and growth response of jack pine on the boreal site with white pine (Pinus strobus L.) response to the same treatments on a more southern Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest site. Response to treatments was interpreted by vector analysis, using crown biomass estimates, rather than needle biomass, to integrate longer term response to treatment. For both species, treatments including vegetation control by herbicide resulted in greater crown biomass and N accumulation; the greatest response was observed following the three treatments combined: scarification, fertilization and vegetation control. White pine had a stronger relative response to treatments than the boreal species, jack pine, supporting the hypothesis that the boreal species does not show as great an acclimation response to changing resource availability.					; Munson, Alison/B-1248-2013	Munson, Alison/0000-0001-6013-7998; 													0378-1127					AUG	1995	76	1-3					169	179		10.1016/0378-1127(95)03547-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1127(95)03547-N													WOS:A1995TC76200014
J	HAIRSTON, NG; DILLON, TA				HAIRSTON, NG; DILLON, TA			FLUCTUATING SELECTION AND RESPONSE IN A POPULATION OF FRESH-WATER COPEPODS	EVOLUTION												The timing of springtime production of diapausing eggs by a population of the freshwater copepod, Diaptomus sanguineus, has been shown previously to be consistent with avoidance of seasonally intense fish predation. Natural selection acting on the timing of diapause fluctuates between years depending upon the population density of fish. Here we show that, in the field, the mean timing of diapause shifts between years in response to fluctuations in selection. Diapause is earlier in years following high predator density, and is later in years following low predator density. Although selection intensity in individual years may be large, the mean intensity over the decade of fluctuating selection investigated here is close to zero. Photoperiod sensitivity of the diapause-timing trait is heritable in the laboratory. The combination of fluctuating selection and multigeneration storage of genotypes as diapausing eggs in lake sediments may contribute to the maintenance of the genetic variation that permits the rapid selection response seen in the field.																			0014-3820	1558-5646				NOV	1990	44	7					1796	1805		10.2307/2409508	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2409508								28567814					WOS:A1990EP84500008

Polystoma okomuensis n. sp (Monogenea: Polystomatidae) from Boulenger's striped frog, Phlyctimantis boulengeri (Perret, 1986) in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												Polystoma okomuensis is described as a new species of the Polystomatidae parasitic in the urinary bladder of Boulenger's striped frog Phlyctimantis boulengeri in the Okomu National Park, Edo State, Nigeria. Although other African polystomes have been reported from Nigeria, this is the first to be described from the country and the first from Phlyctimantis. It is distinguished from other African Polystoma species by a combination of characters, including the body size, size and shape of the hamuli, size and shape of marginal hooklets and intestinal location. Phlyctimantis boulengeri was found to be infected in two of four seasonal lakes where specimens were caught with prevalences and mean intensities ranging from 14.3 to 22% and 1.0 to 1.5, respectively.

A total of 400 fyke-nets was set randomly along the shoreline at intervals of approximately 3 m, and hauled over 7 months. The mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) was found vary for sampling periods and treatments. In both treatments, average of CPUE were increased with increasing sampling periods. In addition, mean CPUE was found significantly different in both treatments (P<0.05). The overall average CPUE in non-baited traps were 2 times greater than baited traps. More crayfish occupant non-baited traps (n= 1947 traps, 69.5%) than baited traps (n= 945 traps, 33.7%). The larger and older crayfish were caught non-baited traps while baited traps had smaller size crayfish. Although there were significant differences in the capture of crayfish between non-baited and baited traps, but no differences were found males and females in both treatments for 7 months study. There was an obvious increased number of traps caught crayfish in both non-baited and baited traps from July to December. The catching of crayfish had been prohibited by law until 1999 in Lake Egirdir. When catching of crayfish was allowed again, fishing potential increased gradually each season. Crayfish behaviour appears to have the most effect on catch per unit trapping effort, but without bait can improve the overall catch. Improvement in harvesting efficiency can be achieved by developing trap designs that maximize catch while minimizing escape of crayfish.					; MAZLUM, Yavuz/AAT-6749-2021; Günlü, Ali/JAX-3281-2023	GUNLU, ALI/0000-0001-9662-7497; MAZLUM, Yavuz/0000-0002-9547-0966; 													1303-2712					JUN	2011	11	2					227	232		10.4194/trjfas.2011.0207	http://dx.doi.org/10.4194/trjfas.2011.0207													WOS:000296070300006

Soil samples from the watersheds indicated similar atmospheric exposure of the lakes. No biomass dilution was observed in Lake E compared to Lake O. Lake E had higher levels of PCB based on organic carbon and lipid mass in sedimenting matter (1.5x), surface sediment (1.4x) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) (2.4x), and also higher settling fluxes of particulate matter and PCB measured in sediment traps and in surface sediment. Phytoplankton was responsible for most of the PCB transport to the sediment in Lake E. Higher DDD/DDE ratios seemed to correlate to a high load of p,p '-DDT more than to that of anaerobic conditions. A high DDD/DDE ratio was recorded in the deep sediment core from Lake O together with high levels of sDDT and was also highest in the sediment traps during periods with, probably, the highest runoff of parental DDT from the watershed.

Changes in the chemistry and biota of Lake Carey: a large salt lake impacted by hypersaline discharge from mining operations in Western Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA					9th Conference of the International-Society-for-Salt-Lake-Research	SEP 26-30, 2005	Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, AUSTRALIA	Int Soc Salt Lake Res	Curtin Univ Technol			The environment of Lake Carey, a large salt lake in the goldfields of Western Australia, has been subjected to mining for the past 100 years. The effect of discharge of hypersaline water to the playa as a result of pit dewatering has been a grave concern. The aim of this paper was to investigate the influences of seasonal parameters and mining activity on the physico-chemical and biological attributes of Lake Carey. Assessment of water and sediment chemistry and benthic microbial communities (BMCs) has been carried out opportunistically since 1999, with particular emphasis on the differences between sites receiving dewatering discharge currently or in the past (Impacted Sites), and those which have never received dewatering discharge (Control Sites). Results of water and sediment analyses indicated that the impacts of dewatering discharge on Lake Carey were localised and evident in the vicinity of the discharge sites. However, large rainfall events, such as the cyclonic rainfall in 2004, could result in flushing and amelioration of sediments. This was also reflected in the sites which were historically impacted by dewatering discharge. The sites directly impacted by dewatering discharge displayed poor abundance and species richness of diatoms compared to the sites unaffected by dewatering discharge. However, recovery of these sites in terms of species richness and abundance is also initiated by large rainfall events, as shown by data collected from the historical dewatering discharge sites.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2009	626	1					53	66		10.1007/s10750-009-9744-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9744-6													WOS:000264182000006

The main stream of CO2 in May-June is directed to the atmosphere, and its runoff to the water surface is observed in September. A correlation between the biomass of phito- and picoplankton and the content of CO2 and biogenic elements in the lake water is revealed.

The number of leeches attracted by a collector per hour was taken as an indicator for population density. Leeches were most abundant in May/June, and were almost absent during the cold season (November - March). Leeches with a weight of less than 1 g occurred principally between July and October with a peak in July. It is thought that these individuals represent newly hatched leeches. Although both study areas are close to each other, significant differences were found in respect to mean leech size and the seasonal frequency of leeches (both total number and certain age classes). It is suggested that leech biology is greatly dependent on factors such as microclimate and the availability of hosts, and no general conclusions on phenology can be drawn. There is therefore no scientific basis for restricting commercial leech collecting to certain months of the year.

Factors influencing productivity of common loons (Gavia immer) breeding on circumneutral lakes in Nova Scotia, Canada	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th Conference on Limnology and Water Birds	AUG 03-07, 2003	Sackville, CANADA	WG Aquat Birds				Common loons (Gavia immer) are top predators that are sensitive to biotic and abiotic conditions associated with their breeding lakes, so factors such as lake chemistry and human activity or disturbance are thought to influence their seasonal and long-term reproductive success. We used two indices of loon productivity to evaluate (1) temporal patterns and (2) relationships with physical and chemical lake characteristics and human activities. Data collected from 1991 to 2000 by volunteers of the Canadian Lakes Loon Survey (CLLS) in Nova Scotia showed that loon productivity, as indexed by both the proportion of resident pairs that produced at least one large young (P(s1)) and the proportion of successful pairs that produced two large young (P(s2)), did not vary substantially from year to year and showed no linear trend from 1991 to 2000. Average estimates (1991-2000) for P(s1) and P(s2) were 0.49 +/- 0.02 and 0.43 +/- 0.03, respectively, and the mean number of chicks per residential pair over that time was 0.75 +/- 0.04. We found that human disturbance and shoreline development did not influence loon productivity during the prefledging stage on lakes surveyed by CLLS volunteers. Proportion of resident pairs rearing at least one large young was independent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of breeding lakes, but there was a positive relationship between the proportion of successful pairs rearing two large young and DOC. Both indices of loon productivity tended to be negatively correlated with lake pH. These results were not consistent with other findings that loon productivity generally declines with lake acidity, but likely reflect the preponderance of circumneutral (pH 6.5-7.0) lakes surveyed by the CLLS volunteers in Nova Scotia.																			0018-8158					SEP	2006	567						215	226		10.1007/s10750-006-0043-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0043-1													WOS:000239147500017
J	Yadav, DN				Yadav, DN			Oxygen isotope study of evaporating brines in Sambhar Lake, Rajasthan (India)	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Sambhar Lake in the Thar desert of India behaves as a ''terminal lake'' in which inflow is balanced by evaporation. At present the source of the water to the lake is mainly through atmospheric precipitation and through surface runoff via two major seasonal streams (Roopangarh and Mendha). The meteoric contribution of water in the lake during the recharge period is suggested by the oxygen isotope data of lake waters and precipitation samples which were collected during the lake's recharge period. In subsequent months, the lake undergoes evaporation resulting in formation of hyper saline brine. The delta(18)O results for groundwaters adjacent to the lake suggest that they are not influenced by recharge from the lake, whereas the shallow sub-surface brines occurring below the lake bed show mixing with meteoric and/or lake waters during the monsoon season and with lake waters during post-monsoon seasons. The isotopic evolution of oxygen in the Sambhar Lake waters during the annual evaporation cycle is explained through the Craig-Gordon model taking into account the fluctuation in lake water volumes due to evaporation, equilibrium and kinetic fractionation factors, and the effect of changing seasonal temperature and humidity. The model calculations suggest that back-condensation of isotopically light atmospheric water vapor (delta(18)O, -20 parts per thousand) dominantly controls the isotopic evolution of oxygen in the lake during the annual evaporation cycle.																			0009-2541					MAY 15	1997	138	1-2					109	118		10.1016/S0009-2541(96)00154-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0009-2541(96)00154-4													WOS:A1997XA81000008

We estimated these attributes of female pink salmon spawners in samples of daily cohorts tagged as they entered fresh water and used generalized linear models to analyze variation in the attributes with respect to environmental factors. Spawners varied in stream life (5-11 days), spawning efficiency (30-70% of females in daily entry cohorts retained less than 500 eggs at death), and spawning habitat (30-70% spawned in the lake outlet stream rather than the lake inlet stream). Observed variation of habitat (proportionately more use of the cooler inlet stream early in the spawning season when stream temperatures are warm and development is rapid) would contribute to synchronicity of fry emigration, which is known to be positively correlated with subsequent survival in Auke Lake pink salmon.																			0706-652X					JAN	1997	54	1					96	104		10.1139/cjfas-54-1-96	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-1-96													WOS:A1997XB78600011

The project was based on a new method of in-situ freezing of unconsolidated surficial sediments in deep lakes. With this freeze-core technique a detailed, high-resolution stratigraphy of the varved sediments at the deepest point of Baldeggersee has been established for the period of 1885-1993. Annual and seasonal sediment samples were analyzed. Concentrations of redox active metals in sediments were calibrated as proxy indicators for the reconstruction of hypolimnetic oxygen conditions. Particle size analysis and varve measurements were used to discriminate between the influence of nutrients and climate on sediment formation and accumulation. Baldeggersee is an ideal system for calibrating indicators of deep-water oxygen concentrations because it underwent dramatic changes in nutrient loading and redox conditions during this century. The hypolimnion has been seasonally anoxic for the last 100 years and phosphorus content decreased by a factor of five in the last 20 years. Meromixis was observed between 1960 and 1980. Since 1983 the deep water has been artificially oxygenated. This well documented change in deep-water oxygen concentration represents a unique whole-lake experiment that can be used to analyze the geochemical response of the sediments.

J	Ferencz, B; Dawidek, J				Ferencz, Beata; Dawidek, Jaroslaw			The Role of Confluence in Shaping Water Quality Parameters on Example of the Flow-Through Lake Bikcze (Eastern Poland)	WATER												The role of confluence (flowability) in shaping the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and pH was determined using a model approach. The calculations considered both horizontal and vertical variability of parameters. There was a general tendency for the pH and oxygen to increase along the transect connecting the place of surface water inlet, deepest point of the lake basin and the place of water outlet, and the reverse tendency for chlorophyll. The average gradient for particulate radius was calculated as arithmetic mean value of six partial gradients (corresponding to individual depths, every 0.5 m). Values of average gradients indicated high dynamics of DO and pH concentration changes as well as low chlorophyll-a variability. A slight inclination of the final resultant vector gradients of DO and pH from the surface water inlet, deepest point of the lake basin and the place of water outlet transect indicated the dominant role of confluence in these parameters variability (values amounted to 6.08 mgkm(-1) and 3.34 pH unitskm(-1), respectively). The value of the chlorophyll-a gradient vector (1.86 mu gkm(-1)) indicated a slight differentiation of the parameter in the basin, independent of the hydrological conditions. The concentration of chl-a in the polymictic Lake Bikcze resulted from the effect of the limnic conditions; the flowability of the lake was just one of many factors affecting the variability of the parameter.					; Ferencz, Beata/AFQ-7259-2022	Dawidek, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-9335-4614; Ferencz, Beata/0000-0001-9003-7517; 														2073-4441				JUN	2018	10	6							679	10.3390/w10060679	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10060679													WOS:000436515100010
J	Tounsi, M; Khedhri, I; Afli, A				Tounsi, M.; Khedhri, I.; Afli, A.			What role do environmental and anthropogenic factors play in the variability of benthic macrofauna in the northern lagoon of Tunis?	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The northern lagoon of Tunis is closed, except for a limited communication with the sea via a very narrow channel. It is subjected, as the majority of Mediterranean lagoons, to environmental/anthropogenic constraints related mainly to the slowness of circulation and renewal of its waters, and also to surrounding human activities. Fifteen stations distributed in the northern lagoon of Tunis were sampled seasonally. The main physicochemical parameters of the water and the sediment were measured and the macro-invertebrates were sampled and identified. Results show that the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients are relatively low in the study site compared with other Tunisian and Mediterranean lagoons, and the dissolved oxygen content and the pH are relatively satisfactory. However, the temperature and salinity which are higher compared with other Tunisian lagoons show remarkable seasonal variations, and seem to play interesting role in shaping community structure. Thus, the macrofauna community is poorly diversified and impoverished during warm/dry seasons, but slightly improved with precipitation and flow of freshwater during cool/rainy seasons. According to our own results and those of the literature, it seems that the northern lagoon of Tunis has for several years been affected by some major factors, mainly high temperature and salinity, sediment silting and perhaps an excess of organic matter. This has led to deep changes in the macrofauna community before being in its current status.						tounsi, moufida/0000-0003-0669-8414													1585-8553	1588-2756				JUN	2018	19	1					21	34		10.1556/168.2018.19.1.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/168.2018.19.1.3													WOS:000439811900003
J	Wang, H; Ji, FQ; Pang, Y				Wang, Hua; Ji, Fengqiang; Pang, Yong			FLUCTUATION OF RIVER NETWORK WATER ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY IN A COMPLICATED RIVER-LAKE SYSTEM	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Aiming at river network in a complicated river-lake system, a new water environmental carrying capacity (WECC) calculation method was presented based on multi-objectives including water quality objectives for rivers, water quality objectives for control sections, pollution zones length at the sewage outlets and pollution zones area at the external lake inlets. The river network to the northwest of Lake Taihu was selected as the study area. Based on this new method, the WECC fluctuation was analyzed by 1-2D coupled numerical model which had been validated against the field data. Results showed that WECC changes obviously among different hydrological years, and the WECC for COD is 68938.8 metric tons in high flow year, which is 15.4% and 35.0% higher than that in normal flow year and low flow year. The WECC variation with time in different hydrological years is basically similar that the WECC in flood (May-October) season is markedly larger than that in dry season. While the fluctuation range of the WECC varies with hydrological conditions, which is higher in high flow year than that in normal flow year and low flow year.																			1582-9596	1843-3707				JUN	2018	17	6					1511	1520		10.30638/eemj.2018.150	http://dx.doi.org/10.30638/eemj.2018.150													WOS:000435677800025

Thymelaeaceae)	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Eastern Leatherwood (Dirca palustris L., Thymelaeaceae) is a sporadically occurring understory shrub of shady Acer saccharum-Tsuga canadensis-Betula allegheniensis stands in the northwestern Great Lakes states. Temperature during the pollination season (late April and early May) varies greatly between years and presumably limits pollinator activity. In addition, very limited light availability poses the question of how stable flower production, fruit set, and fruit production are through time when vegetative growth must also be supported from a limited pool of photosynthate. We compared reproductive performance characteristics among natural stands in Upper Michigan, USA across seven years. In addition, we inquired whether small or deeply shaded shrubs tended to be less consistent fruit producers. Fruit set fluctuated considerably over the period, but several conspicuously good and poor years did not correspond to temperature patterns. Flower production was largely stable at the stand level over the seven year period, with increases in years 2000 and 2001. Fruit production was a function of shrub size and did not differ between years or between stands. At an individual level, small and deeply shaded individuals tended to have one or two conspicuously good fruiting years against a background of low fruit production; sunlit and larger individuals were more consistent fruit producers. Fruit production was not related to the previous year's fruit crop. Shrub size and, secondarily, light availability were the important determinants of fruit production, implying that stand age and history govern the population recruitment of leatherwood.																			0040-9618					OCT-DEC	2004	131	4					292	304		10.2307/4126935	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4126935													WOS:000227081000002
J	Vidakovic, J; Bogut, I				Vidakovic, J; Bogut, I			Aquatic nematodes of Sakadas lake (Kopacki rit Nature Park, Croatia)	BIOLOGIA												Aquatic free-living nematode assemblages were investigated between January 1998 and November 2000. The investigation was conducted in the sandy sediment of the deepest part of the central area of Sakadas lake (Kopacki rit Nature Park, Croatia). A total of 24 nematode species belonging to 18 genera was found. The dominant species was Tobrilus gracilis, with the relative abundance ranging from 22.2% to 98.4% of the total nematofauna. Nematode abundance was correlated to the following environmental factors: water-level fluctuation, depth, transparency, seasonal temperature variations and concentration of dissolved oxygen. A correlation analysis showed that the abundance of Mononchus aquaticus depended on the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water. Furthermore, significant correlations existed between the abundance of Brevitobrilus stefanskii and the water level, and between the abundance of B. stefanskii and the water depth. Significant correlations were also found between the dissolved oxygen concentration and the number of species recorded (S), as well as between the dissolved oxygen concentration and the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity (H'). Sakadas lake, the deepest water depression in the Nature Park Kopacki rit, is naturally eutrophicated. During the recorded periods of hypoxia a low number of species and their low abundance was determined, but there was a high relative abundance of the tolerant species T. gracilis. The shape of the nematode abundance - biomass comparative curve (ABC) indicates a moderately disturbed investigation site in the lake.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				OCT	2004	59	5					567	575																WOS:000225511900009

Bacterial grazing rates were measured using natural fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) and compared to bacterial production. Small species such as Balanion planctonicum/Urotricha furcata and Rimostrombidium spp./Halteria sp. were the most numerous ciliates on the annual average. Larger ciliates such as Rimostrombidium lacustris and Limnostrombidium spp. contributed significantly to total ciliate biomass, but were relatively unimportant as bacterial grazers. Per capita ingestion rates ranged from 0-194 bacteria ciliate(-1) h(-1) and changed seasonally up to a hundredfold within a given taxon. Approximately 1% of the bacterial production were removed by the ciliate community on the annual average.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2004	89	3					289	304		10.1002/iroh.200310701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200310701													WOS:000222968200006
J	Rohli, RV; Hsu, SA; Lofgren, BM; Binkley, MR				Rohli, RV; Hsu, SA; Lofgren, BM; Binkley, MR			Bowen ratio estimates over Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Estimates of the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux (the Bowen ratio) are derived for Lake Erie based on the method introduced by Roll (1965), using hourly automated observations of lake and air temperatures for Buoy 45005 for the period 1992-1997 (May through November). Roll's method computes beta as the product of the drag coefficient (which varies by atmospheric stability class) and the ratio of the difference between lake temperature (T-sea) and air temperature (T-air) to the sea-air vapor pressure difference. The latter can be estimated empirically as a function of Tsea and dew point temperature (T-d). In the diurnal cycle, beta usually peaks in the afternoon hours and tends to increase as the warm season proceeds. Specifically, during unstable atmospheric conditions, beta varies from approximately .15 to .30, and during times of high static stability, beta tends to have near-zero to slightly negative values. Results allow for an improved understanding of turbulent energy fluxes from a large water body, which may affect other processes, such as ice cover, evaporation rates, and contaminant advection.

We used the following studies: pollen, lithology, organic structures, clay mineralogy, soil and sediment geochemistry, and delta (13)C values. The chronology is based on 13 AMS radiocarbon dates; the humic acid fractions were used in the case of seven samples. Pollen from local origin (swamps, open grass-rich vegetation, and gallery forest) show the development of the wetland area. River-transported pollen from a greater distance (dry forest, montane forest, Alnus) show changes in river activity and reflect large-scale changes of climatic conditions in the Momposina basin. From c. 10,010 to 9370 uncal B.P. (zone BQS-Ia) the river system was of high energy, as inferred by the lithological changes. The landscape was dominated by open grass-rich vegetation with gallery forest along the streams. A marked representation of Alnus and montane forest taxa indicate significant water transport and river dynamics. Climatic conditions were dry. From c. 9370-8430 uncal B.P. (zone BQS-Ib) wetlands were isolated from the main river system, and clayey sediments with kaolinite, smectite and illite as the main minerals accumulated in a lower-energy environment. Climatic conditions were dry and changes in the seasonal precipitation favoured the expansion of the gallery forest. From c. 8430 to 8040 uncal B.P. (zone BQS-Ic) low values of river-transported pollen indicate dry climatic conditions and open vegetation became more abundant. The flooding frequency of the Boquillas site diminished. From 8040 to 4900 uncal B.P. (zone BQS-Id) the Boquillas site was dominated by open vegetation with patches of gallery forest along the streams. Supply of river-transported allochthonous pollen (from many sources) was minimal. Clay minerals from the sediments suggest variable temperature and precipitation. From c. 4900 to 1550 uncal B.P. (zone BQS-II) the site was within the reach of the main river system as is the case today. Frequent floodings, coinciding with peaks of river-transported grains of Alnus and high sediment supply, point to high precipitation in the composite catchment area of the Magdalena, Cauca, San Jorge, and Cesar rivers. High values of phosphorous in the upper part of the core point to the presence of a pre-Hispanic civilization, approximately from 2000 uncal B.P. onward. Construction of an extensive drainage system allowed irrigation as well as drainage depending the annual cycle of precipitation. The landscape was significantly modified and allowed an extensive crop production on a system of raised fields.

The seasonal succession of phytoplankton is characterized by a shift in dominance from eukaryotic species to prokaryotic cyanobacteria, as in a eutrophic lake. This unusual pattern for an oligotrophic lake is related to the release of zooplankton phosphorus, rather than to the amount of total phosphorus. The highest estimated values of this released phosphorus occur during the co-dominance of small-sized species and of one calanoid population, both under natural and experimental conditions. Our experimental results clearly reveal that a blue-green species replaces non-blue-green ones when environmental conditions render low or intermediate values for released phosphorus, irrespective of the grazing pressure. The absence of predators or high levels of released phosphorus stimulate non-blue-green growth. These results agree with the successional pattern observed for the algal assemblage under natural conditions. Nutrient recycling plays an essential role in the maintenance of the metabolism of the pelagic system, and therefore the prevalence of a top-down regulation mechanism as proposed for such low-nutrient environments should be reconsidered.

Fourteen sites were sampled every season for two years. The ichthyofauna consisted mainly of cypriniforms and siluriforms and also included cyprinodontiforms and perciforms. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis indicated that geography, water quality, and stream hydraulics were the principal physiochemical correlates of fish assemblage structure. Monsoon rains and associated parameters had substantial secondary influence, and vegetation composition and abundance were also significant. The fish fauna showed longitudinal replacement and addition of species, as the number of species increased from one in the headwaters to a maximum of 33 in lowland sites.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				FEB 11	1993		1					48	60																WOS:A1993KN22000004

Thermal structure had a circulation period from May to July and stratification during the other months. The phytoplankton consisted of 76 taxa, was dominated by the cyanophyte Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and attained concentrations ranging from 7,759,000 up to 98,160,000 org. l(-1). The zooplankton consisted of 36 taxa and was present in densities between 8 and 8,056 org. l(-1). In stations, or seasons with highly eutrophic conditions, there was a decrease in total phytoplankton and an increase in bacteria and total zooplankton. The results had spatial and temporal variations. Spatial variation demonstrated the existence of water quality deterioration at two or three sampling points. Temporal variation showed the influences of water column stability and the dry versus rainy seasons on nutrient concentrations and the planktonic community.					; Castelo Branco, Christina/GSE-3699-2022	Castelo Branco, Christina W/0000-0002-0509-171X; 													0018-8158					NOV 1	1996	337	1-3					171	181		10.1007/BF00028518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00028518													WOS:A1996WB14600017

Does Flood Pulsing Act as a Switch to Store or Release Sediment-Bound Carbon in Seasonal Floodplain Lakes? Case Study from the Colombian Orinoco-Llanos and the Brazilian Pantanal	WETLANDS												Wetlands have been identified as key elements of global carbon budgets. Today, due to increasing anthropogenic carbon emissions, the carbon storage capacity of these ecosystems has become of global interest. The focus of this research was to determine the storage capacity and mechanisms of carbon sequestration of Neotropical seasonal shallow lakes (SSLs), assessing their flood pulse, biomass, geomorphology and sediment composition. We applied a standardized and extensive sampling to five SSLs from the Colombian Orinoco-Llanos and five from the Brazilian Pantanal, during both flooded and non-flooded seasons. We found that sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage capacity in SSLs is significantly driven by the number of flooded days (p-value = 0.0057) rather than by their biomass production. The Orinoco-Llanos and Pantanal lakes differ in morphology, and thus in their inundation patterns. SSLs of the Orinoco-Llanos are more concave, having a significantly higher number of flooded days/year than SSLs from Pantanal. These hydrologic differences affect SOC storage, resulting in a significantly higher SOC storage in SSLs from Orinoco-Llanos than in Pantanal. A synopsis of data from both regions suggests the existence of a critical threshold between "non-flooded season losses" and "non-flooded season storage" of SOC in SSLs in a range of 225-275 flooded days/year.

Zooplankton structure and seasonal dynamics are compared, and the importance of biotic interactions and seasonality (temperature and photoperiod) as determinants of the observed patterns is evaluated in light of collected data and previous knowledge of the systems. The main events in zooplankton seasonal succession were restricted to the short period of stratification and were similar in the two lakes. Basin morphometry and biota are considered for explaining the marked between-lakes difference in community structure: Daphnia dominates in the shallow lake Lombola, where brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) is most represented; while rotifers and the copepods Eudiaptomus graciloides (Lilljeborg) and Cyclops scutifer Sars dominate in Takvatn, where Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) has the hegemony of the pelagic.																			0018-8158						1999	411						19	29		10.1023/A:1003823200449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003823200449													WOS:000084893200003

The mean lengths of age-5 and age-9 burbot were 198 mm and 217 mm, respectively. Stomach contents of 45 burbot (144-274 mm) and 331 whitefish (117-345 mm) were analysed to determine any possible diet overlap between the studied species. According to logistic regressions, the main diet of burbot longer than 257 mm was fish, whereas the smallest burbot (< 165 mm) ingested mainly insect larvae. The length-dependent probabilities of burbot ingesting certain food items did not differ between the ice-covered and open-water periods. During the ice-covered period burbot preferentially preyed on molluscs, insect larvae and benthic crustaceans, while most whitefish smaller than 274 mm ingested zooplankton. During the open-water period, more than 50% of whitefish smaller than 191 mm ingested zooplankton, while those in the length interval 127-244 mm preferred benthic crustaceans. The largest whitefish (> 294 mm) ingested insect larvae during the ice-covered period and insect pupae during the open-water period. Independently of season, most large whitefish (> 274 mm) ingested molluscs. The diet overlap between burbot and whitefish was thus highest during the ice-covered period.					; Lappalainen, Jyrki/IAM-3496-2023	Lappalainen, Jyrki/0000-0002-4631-3788; 													0003-455X	1797-2450					1999	36	4					205	214																WOS:000084735300002

Four rotifer species, Polyarthra vulgaris, Trichocerca rousseleti, Keratella cochlearis and Filinia longiseta, dominated rotifer assemblages of both lakes. Their population densities changed seasonally with species-specific trajectories, but these dynamics were not related to seasonal variations in water temperature and dissolved oxygen content. Analysis of the population dynamics revealed that the instantaneous death rate affected the rate of the density change more strongly than the instantaneous birth rate in ail dominant rotifer species. The estimated daily ration of predatory rotifers and copepods was higher than the estimated finite death rate of the rotifers in most cases. Effects of food limitation and competition with herbivorous crustaceans seemed to be less important compared to that of the invertebrates predation. These results indicate that in Lakes Ohnuma and Konuma the population dynamics of rotifers were mainly determined by invertebrate predators through top-down control.

It is assumed that variations are mainly produced by internal wave modes propagating in the mean flow and mean stratification. The analysis provides estimates of the propagation characteristics, energy density, and directional flux of the internal waves, as well as the temporal and vertical distribution of Richardson number, Ri, on scales that may be smaller than those separating the measuring instruments. The method is tested with measurements made in Lake Geneva, and provides realistic quantitative estimates of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass, epsilon, and of the vertical diffusivity, K-v, which are useful in establishing the processes leading to diapycnal mixing.																			0024-3590					JUL	1998	43	5					936	945		10.4319/lo.1998.43.5.0936	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.5.0936													WOS:000076115800018

The biology of pygmy whitefish, Prosopium coulterii, in a closed sub-boreal lake:: spatial distribution and diel movements	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Using gillnets and trap nets, we examined the spatial distribution, diel movements, and environmental tolerances of pygmy whitefish, Prosopium coulterii, in a small boreal lake in north-central British Columbia. Most gillnets were set below the thermocline but we also fished a shore net in the littoral zone. During the ice-free season (May to November) there was a strong diel onshore-offshore movement: during the day pygmy whitefish were offshore and below the thermocline (water temperatures of 4-6 degrees C) but at night they were inshore and above the thermocline (water temperatures of 12-18 degrees C). This onshore-offshore movement occurred close to the bottom and, regardless of where they were caught, most fish were < 4 m off the bottom. Oxygen concentrations in most of the hypolimnion dropped to < 5.0 mg l(-1) in June and by late August to < 1.0 mg l(-1); indicating pygmy whitefish can tolerate low oxygen conditions. The catch of pygmy whitefish in gillnets set below the thermocline was highly skewed: 53% of the nets were empty, 37% caught 18 or less fish, and 10% caught 70% of the total catch (742 fish). Trap nets produced similarly skewed results: most trap net sets caught no pygmy whitefish but one set caught over 2,000 individuals. Our catch data suggest that in Dina Lake #1 some pygmy whitefish aggregate.																			0378-1909					AUG	2006	76	2-4					317	327		10.1007/s10641-006-9035-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9035-2													WOS:000240317000016

Such lakes offer excellent opportunities to study the interaction of water chemistry and plant communities. The response of diatom species to environmental gradients was assessed by constructing a diatom and water chemistry dataset from 59 lakes at two locations (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands and Signy Island, South Orkney Islands). Results indicate that diatom species abundance is predominately related to nutrient and salinity gradients. The dataset will be used to create transfer functions which can be applied to sediment core diatom assemblages to reconstruct historical patterns of lake chemistry.

Samples were sectioned, radioisotopically dated, and analyzed for 22 individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and its metabolites. The most abundant congeners in the sediments were 28, 44, 66, 110, 138, 149, 153, and 180. PCB fluxes to the sediment increased slowly from the late 1920s/early 1930s until the late 1940s, escalating sharply thereafter. Maximum PCB fluxes (3.26 ng cm-2 year-1) occurred to sediments dated from the late 1950s/early 1960s. During the following decade inputs of PCBs decreased rapidly, concurrent with restrictions on production and use. Present input levels are ca. 2.17 ng cm-2 year-1, with lower chlorinated congeners making the major contribution. Inputs of DDT and its analogues peaked in the mid-1950s (19.2 ng SIGMA-DDT cm-2 year-1), with DDD the major metabolite. The possible influence of postdepositional factors and coring artifacts on the concentration depth profiles and the apparent presence of PCBs in pre-1930 sediments are discussed.

J	MEYER, A				MEYER, A			ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF THE TROPHIC POLYMORPHISM IN CICHLASOMA-CITRINELLUM (PISCES, CICHLIDAE)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The neotropical cichlid fish Cichlasoma citrinellum is polymorphic in the structure of its pharyngeal jaw apparatus and external morphology. The pharyngeal jaws are either gracile and bear slender, pointed teeth (papilliform) or robust with strong, rounded teeth (molariform). Molariform morphs have a ''benthic'', and papilliform morphs a ''limnetic'' body form. Furthermore, this species is also polychromatic, with yellow and black morphs. The molariform morphology of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus adapts the fish for cracking and feeding on snails. Based on analysis of stomach contents, 94% of the molariform morph ate snails whereas only 19% of the papilliform morph did so. This result suggests that the morphs occupy different ecological niches. The morphology of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus does not correlate significantly with sex, but it does with body colouration (P < 0.005). Cichlasoma citrinellum mate assortatively with their own colour; therefore a mating preference for colour may lead to genetic isolation of trophic morphs. The frequency of the molariform morph differs strikingly among populations of five Nicaraguan lakes and its abundance is correlated with the abundance of snails, the fishes'' principal prey item. Among populations the frequency of molariform morphs decreases in the dry season. Morphology possibly changes reversibly within particular individuals between seasons. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity and polymorphisms may be an adaptive characteristic of cichlid fishes. Patterns of intraspecific morphological variation match patterns of interspecific morphological diversification which suggests that universal developmental mechanisms canalize the possible expressions of morphology. The ability to respond morphologically to environmental shifts, in conjunction with genetically determined trophic polymorphisms and sexual selection via mate choice, could be the basis for speciation through intermediate stages of polymorphism of the impressive adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes.

Atmospheric Processes in the South Baikal Basin and Their Role in Relief Formation	ATMOSPHERE												Climatic conditions and the solar and circulation features in the Lake Baikal basin are analyzed. The relationship between the heat balance and surface temperature of slopes is shown, taking into account each features' physical state. The dependence of the heat balance values and the underlying surface temperature were revealed. The quantitative material allowed us to reveal regional patterns of geomorphological regimes, seasonal rhythm, and the dynamics of processes. In Cisbaikalia, within the denudation cycle, semi-humid states under water erosion and aeolian processes of moderate intensity predominate. The semi-arid state manifests itself under decreasing humidification. In these years, the probability of extreme manifestations of aeolian processes is high. The humid states occur in 1% of cases, primarily in extremely wet years, when fluvial processes are dramatically activated. In Cisbaikalia, climate warming and an increase in mean annual temperature have been observed in recent years. Depending on the moisture amplitude and heat availability, the intensity and direction of water erosion and aeolian processes is changing now. The dynamics of relief-forming processes cause an increase in loose substance in the lake and the exacerbation of the ecological situation.

No reductions in somatic energy content (carcass and intestines) were detected during the spawning period. Post-spawning somatic lipid, protein and total energy content did not differ between male spawners, female spawners and immatures. The recorded reproductive output consisted of gonad tissue equivalent to 13% of total pre-spawning energy in females and 4% in males, respectively. Mean stored somatic lipid reserves were as low as 2.8% and did not change significantly from pre- (30 June) to post-spawning (1% October) samples. Female fecundity varied between 41 and 84 (mean 60) eggs, with a corresponding body length varying between 110 to 160 mm (mean 13%). Mean yearly survival rate after maturation was 70% for females and 64% for males, respectively. This particularly low reproductive investment is discussed in relation to environmental conditions and low resource availability.

J	Parker, JM; Anderson, SH				Parker, JM; Anderson, SH			Habitat use and movements of repatriated Wyoming toads	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We studied habitat use and movements of a repatriated population of federally endangered Wyoming toads (Bufo baxteri) after the breeding season at Mortensen Lake, Albany County, Wyoming, USA. We followed 8 adult toads using telemetry (n = 68 relocations) during periods of activity and observed 59 post-metamorphic juvenile toads (n = 59 locations). Adult toads used habitat with a greater mean vegetation canopy cover (mean = 52.6%) than juveniles (mean = 39.20%). We found adults farther from the shoreline (mean = 1.32 m) than juveniles (mean = 1.04 m). Substrates used by toads had a mean surface temperature of 20.31 degreesC for adults and 23.05 degreesC for juveniles. We found most adult and juvenile toads on saturated substrates. All adult toads sampled did not move outside of a 30 x 500 m area along the east-to-south shore where they were captured. Toads were active diurnally through the end of October. We found toads torpid at night. We compared our results to a similar study of the historic population and found that adult toads of the current population used denser vegetation than those of the historic population. Unlike many bufonids, terrestrial stages of the Wyoming toad appear to depend on saturated substrates. The best logistic regression predictors of adult and juvenile toad presence were surface temperature and distance to shore. Survey transects within the moist margin of the lake (! 10 m from water) and after substrates have reached temperatures greater than or equal to20 degreesC will likely yield more detections.

The correlation between clearance rate of D. galeata and total phytoplankton biomass was negative only if biomass of Microcystis aeruginosa was excluded. This suggests that M. aeruginosa is the main grazing resistant phytoplankton species in the Bautzen reservoir. Except for M. aeruginosa and grazing-resistant Staurastrum quadridentatum spec. nov. (Scharf, 1995) no other phytoplankton species was able to reach a biovolume above 1 mm(3) L-1 when the clearance rate of Daphnia exceeded 0.1 L L-1 d(-1). There was significant positive correlation between mean cell or colony size of phytoplankters and clearance rate of D. galeata, showing an advantage of bigger cells or colonies at high grazing pressure. Cross-correlation indicated a time lag of about one month between changes in grazing pressure and a change in phytoplankton mean size. The phytoplankton species were divided into edible and inedible fractions, depending on their width and length. No edible species were able to reach high biovolumes during high biomasses of D. galeata but a positive correlation was found between the edible fraction of phytoplankton biovolume and the clearance rate of D. galeata. However, this relationship disappeared when the `ingestible edible' fraction of M. aeruginosa was excluded, suggesting a rejection of `edible' Microcystis colonies by D. galeata. A negative correlation was found between the inedible fraction of phytoplankton biovolume without M. aeruginosa and the clearance rate of D. galeata which might be due to superior competition of M. aeruginosa. We could clearly show that biomanipulation might not work well with respect to the reduction of total phytoplankton biomass under hypertrophic conditions and finally discuss a theoretical threshold of phosphorus (probably around 80 mu g L-1), below which biomanipulation should become effective.

The prevalence of diphyllobothriosis in men and dogs in the riverside sector of Lake Rinihue during 1991-1992 was compared with prevalence in 1986-1987 and 1951 to evaluate its impact of the health education. Likewise, the prevalence and intensify of the infection by Diphyllobothrium latum and Diphyllobothrium dendriticum in the introduced rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and autochthonous fishes was determined for Lake Rinihue. For the 1986-1987 period, the prevalence of diphyllobothriosis in men and dogs was similar to the 1991-1992 period, but human infection was significantly greater in 1951 with respect to last period. The prevalence and mean intensities of infection by D. dendriticum in rainbow trout presented significant differences, with greater parameters in 1986-1987. For D. latum, prevalence and mean intensity were similar in both periods. The prevalence and intensity of infection by Diphyllobothrium spp. did not present significant differences among the seasons. Only the prevalence of infection by D. dendriticum presented significant differences with respect to the sex of the trout. Trout length had an influence on the prevalence of diphyllobothriosis. Among autochthonous fishes, the silverside, Basilichthys australis, the puye Galaxias maculatus and the perch Percichthys trucha are reported for the first time in Chile, as hosts of D. dendriticum. Only trout and perch presented diphyllobothriosis in muscles. The diet of adult trout and perch suggests that they become infected principally through the consumption of other fish. Infection of cauque, Cauque mauleanum, silversides, puyes and young perch would be through the consumption of copepods.

Because grebes have to provide substantial amounts of invertebrates to their brood, competitive interactions with fish may be expected during the breeding season of grebes. Based on this hypothesis, the distribution of Red-necked Grebes, the abundances of macroinvertebrates, fish, and vegetation, as well as the water depth were determined in a shallow lake during two consecutive breeding seasons. The Red-necked Grebes only utilised the reed bed as breeding site, whereas the adjacent Lagoon, although potentially suitable as breeding site, was not used. Macroinvertebrate biomass was 5-10 times higher in the reed beds than in the Lagoon. The abundance of fish was low in the reed bed but considerably higher in the Lagoon. The results indicate habitat separation between breeding Red-necked Grebe and fish in Lake Takern, and that the separation is related to distribution of food resources birds and fish have in common.

Field observations of depth distribution and seasonal abundance in Little Rock Lake, an experimentally acidified seepage lake in north-central Wisconsin, suggest that Mougeotia might prefer warmer temperatures and carry out net photosynthesis at fairly low light levels. To test these hypotheses, we measured net photosynthesis and respiration at 56 combinations of irradiance and temperature in a controlled environment facility. Optimum conditions were 25 degrees C and 300-2,300 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). Over this range, net photosynthesis averaged 40.4 mg O-2 g(-1) h(-1). Respiration rates increased with both temperature and prior irradiance. Light-enhanced respiration rates were significantly greater than dark respiration rates following irradiance greater than or equal to 164 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). Mougeotia's photosynthetic response to temperature and irradiance explains aspects of its growth and distribution in acidified lakes but it does not by itself explain the magnitude of this alga's growth at low pH.

J	VELDKAMP, R				VELDKAMP, R			DIET OF CORMORANTS PHALACROCORAX-CARBO-SINENSIS AT WANNEPERVEEN, THE NETHERLANDS, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO BREAM ABRAMIS-BRAMA	ARDEA												Recent diet studies in a Cormorant colony in NW Overijssel, The Netherlands, reveal that analysis of regurgitated stomach contents and pellets have several limitations. Nonetheless, the best results of year-round diet studies are to be expected from pellet analysis, especially if a correction for wear in the stomach is applied. Since pellet production of Cormorants rearing young seems to be irregular or even stops, pellets possibly do not give an accurate impression of food eaten by these birds. Regurgitated stomach contents collected during the breeding season are likely to provide a better idea of the food of Cormorants rearing young. Roach, Bream and Pikeperch are the most important prey species, as shown by analysis of both pellets and regurgitates. Total fish consumption of the colony in 1991 was estimated at 245 ton by pellet analysis. Cyprinids made up c. 74% of that amount. The mass share of cyprinids in regurgitates in April-July 1991 was 86%. It is shown that at the study area the consumption of relatively large Bream (up to 31 cm) is far more important than has been suggested by most studies elsewhere. Consumption figures derived from this study suggest that Cormorants at Wanneperveen consumed at least c. 5-16% on mass basis from the available standing stock of Bream in the lakes surrounding the colony in 1991, emphasising on the larger individuals (> 200 mm).																			0373-2266						1995	83	1					143	155																WOS:A1995RM43100017

Data for the main stem (51-degrees to 70-degrees-W) are divided into 13 reaches bounded by meridians of 1-degrees-30' intervals. Within each reach, data are divided into left bank, right bank or islands and lake data are grouped into a morphometric classification that reflects the predominant limnological differences among lakes. The floodplain along the Amazon main stem in Brazil occupies 92,400 km2, of which 11% is covered with lakes. The distribution of floodplain inundation area is variable, but tends to be greater on the left bank, especially in the upper reaches. Lakes with dish-shaped basins are generally the predominant class of lakes on the main stem floodplain. Although only 10% of the lakes are larger than 2 km2, they comprise more than half of the total lake area and are thus important components of the floodplain lake population. The areas of the floodplains along the major Amazonian tributaries within Brazil total 62,000 km2.

Use of habitats by resident and migrant birds in and around a golf course on the Atlantic coast of Morocco	BIRD STUDY												Capsule Woodland bird species were more diverse and more frequently encountered on a Golf Course than in nearby habitats.Aims To assess the occurrence of woodland birds in the recently created Mogador Golf Course compared to surrounding undeveloped woodland.Methods Bird surveys were carried out in four seasons between October 2011 and July 2012, using one-minute point counts to compile species lists for the Golf Course and nearby Woodland. Data were analysed by ANOVA to detect differences between areas and among seasons, for individual species and for the average number of species per count.Results Sixty-six percent of species encountered were in both areas, but 29% were only on the Golf Course. The range of species was higher in all seasons for the Golf Course, and over the whole year was almost twice as large. More species were recorded per one minute count in the Golf Course (4.440.12) than in Woodland (3.56 +/- 0.15). Eight of nine species were more frequently recorded in Golf Course counts.Conclusion Establishment of the Golf Course has benefitted both resident and migrant birds, owing to creation of new habitats (golf fairways and lakes), irrigation, prevention of grazing and retention of previous habitat.																			0006-3657	1944-6705				JAN 2	2014	61	1					111	120		10.1080/00063657.2014.882289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2014.882289													WOS:000330617600012

The river and the reservoirs are both under the threat of pollution primarily originating from several domestic point source discharges and land-based runoff. The numerical and proportional distributions of oligochaetes in Catoren and Kunduzlar Dam Lakes were surveyed seasonally in 2010 and 2011 at two stations on each lake. According to the results of this study, the benthic invertebrate fauna of Catoren Dam Lake consisted of Oligochaeta (40.2 %), Chironomidae larvae (32.2 %) and the varia (27.6 %); the benthic invertebrate fauna of Kunduzlar Dam Lake consisted of Oligochaeta (56.7 %), Chironomidae larvae (18.2 %) and the varia (25.1%). By evaluating the data via a Shannon-Wiener index it was found that the Catoren Dam Lake had an index of 2.32; while Kunduzlar Dam Lake had an index of 3.27. Several physicochemical water quality parameters were also analyzed during this study. The relationships between the dynamics of organisms and environmental parameters were supported by Pearson correlation index. It was determined that Catoren and Kunduzlar Dam Lakes waters were polluted and slightly polluted, respectively. The dominance and abundance of oligochaete species and low species richness showed that similar studies should be carried out periodically in Catoren and Kunduzlar Dam Lakes for the future monitoring of the dam lakes.

S	Badayos, RB	Carating, RB; Galanta, RG; Bacatio, CD			Badayos, Rodrigo B.	Carating, RB; Galanta, RG; Bacatio, CD		The Soils of the Lowlands	SOILS OF THE PHILIPPINES	World Soils Book Series											The lowland soils represent the heavy use of our land resources being easily accessible to the general populace. These are the flat areas located between the sea and the surrounding uplands, hills, and mountains. The alluvial flood plains, being dissected by a meandering river, are regularly visited by floods. Yet, great civilizations of East and West both of the past and of the present were built on river banks because of the agriculturally productive soils and the ease of navigation and transport even to the hinterlands. These are the best areas for agriculture since the farms are annually renewed by the silt that comes with the flood when the monsoon season comes. Ironically these days, because of the pressure of population increase and urban expansion, agriculture finds itself eased out as it competes with residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational land uses. As the farms give way to the residential subdivisions and industrial estates, the centuries-old traditional Filipino houses, slightly raised above grounds and standing on stilts, are abandoned in the quest for more living space. When the annual floods come, the social, economic, and environmental costs are staggering. We also greatly invest on flood protection infrastructures that address more the effects rather than the causes of floods. Understanding our lowland soil resources incorporates a holistic perspective in the development planning process. This chapter dissects the lowland soils into its geographic setting for land management purposes-(1) soils of the coastal areas, (2) soils of the river and lake terraces, and freshwater swamps, (3) soils of the narrow and broad alluvial valleys and flood plains, and (4) soils of the infilled localized valleys, collo-alluvial plains, and fan terraces. These soils are developed from alluvial deposits, with slopes ranging from 0 to 8 %, altitude of less than 100 m above sea level, and temperature of more than 25 degrees C. This chapter includes unpublished but recognized soil series through more recent mapping projects or past soil surveys with missing reports even in the archives.																			2211-1255		978-94-017-8682-9; 978-94-017-8681-2				2014							51	106		10.1007/978-94-017-8682-9_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8682-9_2	10.1007/978-94-017-8682-9												WOS:000340090300004

Determinants of marital behaviour in five Apennine communities of Central Italy inferred by surname analysis, repeated pairs and kinship estimates	HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY												The work makes use of surname analysis, repeated pairs and kinship estimates in 11,009 marriage records celebrated in five communities of the Italian Central Apennine (Celano, Lecce dei Marsi, Ortucchio, Roio, Villavallelonga) from 1802 to 1965 with the objective to deepen knowledge of the relative influence of several determinants on their marital behaviour. These towns are part of the same geographic and economic environment: the slopes of the ancient Fucino Lake. This work, further elaborates the results from previous studies on the bio-demographic model of the region. The data were analyzed according to three periods of approximately 50 years. Results show the highest inbreeding coefficients in the pastoral towns of Roio and Villavallelonga. Repeated pair analysis highlights a certain degree of population subdivision which declined in time in Celano. Lecce dei Marsi and Ortucchio. The highest and increasing values of RP-RPr in time in Roio suggest a general reduction in genetic heterogeneity. This is possibly due to the celebration of marriages among families selected on the economic basis of pastoralism, as this town historically has had a leading tradition of sheep-farming. Villavallelonga, excluding isonymous marriages, shows an increase in repeated pair unions in time, thus revealing a substructure with marriages among preferred lineages. This is in line with previous results on consanguineous marriages which indicated the tendency of avoiding unions between close relatives in this small geographic isolate. This study demonstrates the influence of geographical (altitude) and social factors (pastoralism) on the marital structures of the investigated populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Gökçe, D				Gokce, Didem			VARIATIONS OF PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE RELATED TO WATER QUALITY IN A DEEP DAM LAKE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass were monitored in the upper Euphrates River. The purpose of this study was to obtain detailed information about the composition variations in the phytoplankton community, and to determine the driving force for the succession of the dominant genera. Cyanobacteria were predominant with 76.88 % of the total abundance in the Karakaya Dam Lake. Chlorophyta (7.81 % of the total abundance) was the most abundant group, followed by Bacillariophyta (7.72 %), Dinophyta (7.56 %), and Euglenophyta (0.03 %). The phytoplankton seasonal sequence was mainly correlated with environmental factors. Unimodal species distribution was shown in UPGMA cluster analysis, classified into the two cluster groups. RDA was used to examine relationships between measured environmental variables and phytoplankton populations of the study area. Eigenvalues of axes explained 100 % of the cumulative variance in species data and 99.6 % of the relationship between species and environmental data. According to water quality, DIN: SRP ratio was >16:1. Water temperature and conductivity were main driving forces for the seasonal succession of the abundance. Based on RDA-Pearson correlation analysis, the results showed that the phytoplankton abundance and biomass were positively correlated with the changes of environmental factors (p<0.01, p<0.05). Except for DO, Secchi, SRP, nitrogen, and pH, there were no correlations with the phytoplankton abundance and biomass. It is important to control the exogenous nutrient in order to maintain ecosystem healthiness of Karakaya Dam Lake.

Working in such regions, however, can improve our understanding of remote-sensing tools and their applicability in new contexts, in addition to potentially offering useful information about aquatic ecology. Here, we assess and compare 32 combinations of two ACMs, two WCRs, and three binary categories of data quality standards to optimize a remotely sensed proxy of plankton biomass in Lake Kivu. Each parameter set is compared against the available ground-truth match-ups using Spearman's right-tailed rho. Focusing on the best sets from each ACM-WCR combination, their performances are discussed with regard to data distribution, sample size, spatial completeness, and seasonality. The results of this study may be of interest both for ecological studies on Lake Kivu and for epidemiological studies of disease, such as cholera, the dynamics of which has been associated with plankton biomass in other regions of the world.

The generic composition of phytoplankton was studied monthly during August 2008 to February 2011. All the relevant calculations were done according to three seasons viz. pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon. A total of 96 species belonging to 87 genera were identified under six algal classes. Chlorophyceae showed their maximum species diversity with 45% whereas the Cyanophycean algae showed maximum relative density i.e. 93.11% throughout the study period with Microcystis aeruginosa (45.08%) followed by Aphanocapsa rosena (15.53%). Phytoplankton species of Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Xanthophyceae and Dinophyceae were negligible in number. Maximum and minimum phytoplankton diversity was found in post- monsoon (H. = 0.38) and pre-monsoon (H. = 0.09) respectively. Cyanophycean algae (D = 0.97) dominated in pre-monsoon season. The temperature increased upto 2 degrees C in pre-monsoon season during the study period. Dominance of cyanophycean algae (Microcystis sp.) has been found to be the main reason of eutrophication in Mathura beel.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2014	11	2					37	44																WOS:000211176600006

Samples were taken monthly from one sampling station. A total of 93 taxa belonging to 7 divisions were identified, including Chlorophyta (39 taxa), Heterokontophyta (30 taxa), Cyanobacteria (17 taxa), Euglenophyta (2 taxa), Dinophyta (2 taxa), Charophyta (2 taxa) and Cryptophyta (1 taxa). Cyclotella meneghiniana, Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis protocystis, Arthrospira platensis, and Micractinium pusillum dominated the phytoplankton at least for one season. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that water temperature, transparency conductivity, and total dissolved solids had significant effects on the distribution and abundance of the dominant phytoplankton taxa.

The model is based on the formalization of an idea originally proposed in Italian by Tonolli in 1964, who presented a mass balance of the water initially stored within a lake, taking into account the known seasonal evolution of its thermal structure. The numerical solution of this mass balance provides an approximation to the water age distribution for the conceptualised lake, from which an upper bound to the typical time scales widely used in limnology can be obtained. After discussing the original test case considered by Tonolli, we apply the model to Lake Iseo, a deep lake located in the North of Italy, presenting the results obtained on the basis of a 30 year series of data.

Quarterly economic activity in four economic entities i.e. three municipalities and the county) is examined in a multivariate time series analysis that accounts for the change in population, context of regional unemployment and seasonal variation. The results of the multivariate time series analysis demonstrate that lake level has a negative curvilinear relationship with economic activity. This relationship is limited to the retail trade sector in the nearest municipality, which also has the least diversified economy. Tests show that prior lake levels can forecast retail trade in this limited case, which indicates lake level is causally prior to retail trade.

Lotic and lentic environments of the Pampean Plain	FRESHWATER PHYTOPLANKTON OF ARGENTINA: PHYTOPLANKTON DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY IN DIFFERENT AQUATIC SYSTEMS	Advances in Limnology											The Pampean Plain landscape is characterized by a great number of shallow lakes (flushing, backwater, and seepage lakes) with different degrees of interconnection with rivers and wetlands. The Salado River is the major autochthonous water course of the Buenos Aires Province and is a typical lowland river. The first phytoplankton studies in these shallow lakes were published during the middle of the last century, whereas investigations in lotic environments did not start until 1980. Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta are usually dominant in all water bodies of the region, while Bacillariophyceae are abundant in certain environments. Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria are mainly represented by euplanktonic species, whereas a high proportion of the diatoms are brought in from the periphytic and benthic communities. Shallow lakes of this region are characterized according to the presence or absence of submerged and emergent macrophytes and by the relative predominance of inorganic and organic suspended solids. These conditions influence the temporal and spatial variability of the phytoplankton structure because of the changes in water transparency, nutrient balance, and the zooplankton structure related to macrophyte development. The shallow lakes connected to the Salado River act as an alluvial valley, exchanging organisms between the river and the lakes, though this influence depends on the direction of the water flow, which can reverse during flooding events. The differences in the structure and dynamics of the phytoplankton of lotic and lentic environments of the Pampean Plain are related to the hydrological regime and geomorphologic-hydrologic features, to the incorporation of inocula from connected systems, and to the colonization of submerged macrophytes. In recent years, several hydraulic constructions have been made, which have modified the natural dynamic system and thus, influenced the normal exchange of phytoplankton assemblages in this complex system.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47067-9				2014	65						143	165		10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0039													WOS:000339640200011

Evidence for lacustrine breeding by sanjika Opsaridium microcephalum (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) in Lake Malawi	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Three species of Opsaridium occur in the Lake Malawi catchment. The kabyabya Opsaridium tweddleorum is a small species restricted to inflowing rivers and streams, the mpasa Opsaridium microlepis is a large lake-dwelling species that ascends the lower reaches of inflowing rivers during the rains to spawn, and the sanjika Opsaridium microcephalum has riverine, potamodromous and lake spawning populations. Evidence for sanjika spawning in the lake itself, rather than just in rivers, is presented here in the form of observations of courting behaviour by fully mature males and females on exposed rocky shores, together with the presence of pin-head fry in areas remote from any inflowing streams during the dry season.																			1608-5914	1727-9364					2014	39	4					479	480		10.2989/16085914.2014.982499	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2014.982499													WOS:000346925500016

Statistical analysis of observed and simulated hourly surface wind in the vicinity of the Panama Canal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Surface wind patterns at the Panama Canal vicinity are identified on the basis of 6 years of observed hourly surface wind data and with the use of high-resolution numerical model simulations. Statistical analysis of the observed wind at various stations in the Panama Canal is presented, together with the analysis of simulated surface wind fields that are obtained from the MM5 mesoscale meteorological model using surface wind assimilation and forced by North American regional reanalysis data. The performance analysis indicates that the 2-km-resolution MM5 model surface wind simulations have skill when compared with the observations at the measurement sites. The analysis of the wind fields for the period 2002-2007 shows that the dry season (January to April) is more spatially and temporally coherent than the wet season in the region. The simulated wind shows that the average wind speed reaches up to 7-8 m s(-1) and the frequency of exceeding 5 m s(-1) reaches up to 0.7-0.8 in Lake Gatun, the entrance/exit of the Canal in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, and at high elevations. The dry season exhibits higher climatological wind speeds and exceedence frequencies than the wet season but the wet season shows greater spatial variability. For both seasons, the morning hours have lower average winds than the evening hours. The analysis underlines the significant influence of convection, sea breeze and local conditions (elevation gradients and land surface cover) in the observed and simulated surface wind patterns. The information presented herein, particularly as regards the Canal centerline results, may be useful for identifying the effects of air pollution from sources aboard transiting cargo ships on large communities in the Canal vicinity (e. g. Panama City). Information presented is also relevant to regional wind energy studies and fog formation analyses.

In January 1986 the 28.8 ha lake was closed to fishing for gamefish: largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), northern pike (Esox lucius), and walleye (Stizostedion vitreum). Panfish seasons remained open. Largemouth bass and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were the predominant predator and prey in Round Lake, with bluegill comprising 58% by weight of the largemouth bass diet from 1984 to 1991. Numbers and biomass of stock length (200+ mm) largemouth bass increased following closure of the lake to predator fishing, and there was a reduction in the population of stock-to-quality (80-149 mm) bluegill. Bluegill biomass remained relatively stable from 1984 to 1992, while bluegill numbers decreased. Bluegill relative weight (Wr) and longevity increased. Increased numbers of quality (150+ mm) bluegill by 1988 resulted in higher fishing pressure and panfish harvest.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1998	13	4					391	403		10.1080/02705060.1998.9663636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1998.9663636													WOS:000077651900003
J	Gevao, B; Hamilton-Taylor, J; Jones, KC				Gevao, B; Hamilton-Taylor, J; Jones, KC			Towards a complete mass balance and model for PCBs and PAHs in a small rural lake, Cumbria UK	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper summarizes the processes of exchange/fluxes for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a small well-studied rural lake, Esthwaite Water in northwest England. Measurements of PCB and PAH concentrations have been made in rain, air, water, dated sediment cores, and sediment trap samples over a 2-yr study period and used to determine fluxes to and from the lake. A steady state mass balance model was used to construct an input-output budget for the chemicals and to investigate the relative importance of transport into and out of the lake. The hydraulic transport from the lake was the most important loss mechanism for both PCBs and PAHs. Volatilization, not sedimentation, is currently the dominant loss process for PCBs in the water column, whereas, sedimentation exceeds volatilization for PAHs. The data further suggest that the current sediment-water flux is upward for PCBs and downwards for PAHs, indicating that the sediments might be acting as a secondary source for PCBs but continue to act as a sink for PAHs. Riverine, catchment runoff, or both are believed to be the most important input for PCBs and PAHs to the lake although direct aerial deposition to the lake is also important for PCBs. Differences in the mixtures of compounds in the various compartments suggests significant fractionation of PCBs and PAHs in the air-water-sediment system in the lake.

J	Paul, AJ; Post, JR; Sterling, GL; Hunt, C				Paul, AJ; Post, JR; Sterling, GL; Hunt, C			Density-dependent intercohort interactions and recruitment dynamics: models and a bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) time series	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A simple theoretical model shows that mechanisms of density-dependent survival that result in stable dynamics for populations with only intracohort interactions during the juvenile phase can produce cyclic behaviour when cohorts interact together. We compared these theoretical results with a time series (1971-1985) on juvenile bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) from Eunice Creek, Alberta. Abundance of bull trout in Eunice Creek ranged over two orders of magnitude over the 15 years. By assigning age-classes to the abundance data (using a probabilistic length-frequency analysis), we assessed yearly survival rates for age-classes 1-3. Survival rates for age-classes 1 and 2 were negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with the effective density (an index of total consumption) of all juvenile bull trout in Eunice Creek. These observations support the hypothesis that different age cohorts of juvenile bull trout do interact. Using a stochastic version of the model and parameter values estimated from Eunice Creek, we hypothesize that even moderate levels of adult mortality (an average adult spawns during two seasons) coupled with random variation in the density-independent component of juvenile mortality can result in an apparent cyclic pattern for bull trout. Finally, stock- recruitment relationships for these populations are not represented by a single average curve.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2000	57	6					1220	1231		10.1139/cjfas-57-6-1220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-6-1220													WOS:000087703800012
J	Wilhelm, FM; Lasenby, DC				Wilhelm, FM; Lasenby, DC			Seasonal trends in the head capsule length and body length/weight relationships of two amphipod species	CRUSTACEANA												Amphipod body lengths and weights are important variables in life history, biomass and production determinations. Length and weight are often estimated from head capsule length-body length or weight relationships based on a single field collection. Possible seasonal variation in these relationships is rarely considered. We used seasonal data for two amphipod species (Gammarus lacustris and Diporeia hoyi) to test the hypothesis that head capsule length-body length/weight relationships remain seasonally constant. Slopes of monthly relationships were significantly different (ANCOVA). However, the differences in slope and intercept were trivial, and all monthly regressions yielded similar predictive results. Regressions based on pooled seasonal samples underestimated measured biomass by less than or equal to 5%, while predicted lengths varied between 0 to +/- 2 mm from measured lengths. We conclude that head capsule length-body length/weight relationships for these amphipods are seasonally robust, and may be estimated from single collections provided all size classes are obtained. If all size classes can not be obtained from one sample, relationships should be based on pooled samples.																			0011-216X					JUN	1998	71		4				399	410		10.1163/156854098X00518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854098X00518													WOS:000074552200004
J	ENGLE, DL; MELACK, JM				ENGLE, DL; MELACK, JM			CONSEQUENCES OF RIVERINE FLOODING FOR SESTON AND THE PERIPHYTON OF FLOATING MEADOWS IN AN AMAZON FLOODPLAIN LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Algal biomass and the chemical composition of seston and floating meadow periphyton were measured in an Amazon floodplain lake during a period of channelized river inflow and a period of overbank flow. During both periods, sedimentation of riverine particulates and loss of dissolved nutrients created strong spatial chemical gradients from the river onto the floodplain which were stable for months at a time. The molar N: P of dissolved inorganic nutrients supplied by river water was very low (NO3- + NH4+: SRP < 5) and decreased further as water entered the floodplain. Initial loss of sediment in surface waters increased the organic content of seston and periphyton and decreased the C:N of seston within 2 km of the river. More gradual loss of finer P-rich particles caused 2-4-fold increases in N:P and C:P ratios inside the floodplain. During channelized river inflow, epiphytic algal biomass peaked where inorganic turbidity was high (> 50 mg liter-1) and phytoplankton biomass was low. Later in the year, overbank flow elevated dissolved nutrient levels inside the lake and disrupted thermal stratification. This transition from lentic to lotic conditions coincided with the seasonal high for epiphytic algal biomass and the seasonal low for phytoplankton biomass. Overall, epiphytic algal biomass was 4-10 times higher than phytoplankton biomass on a per unit area basis. In situ bag experiments revealed that inorganic turbidity regulates the ability of attached algae to utilize nutrients supplied by river water. Epiphytic algal biomass decreased after contact with undiluted river water. Epiphytic algal biomass increased 5-fold in river water diluted by 90%.																			0024-3590					NOV	1993	38	7					1500	1520		10.4319/lo.1993.38.7.1500	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.7.1500													WOS:A1993MR97500013

Community structure in enclosures treated with 9, 36, or 157 mu g tebufenozide/L (0.2, 0.7, and 3 times the expected environmental concentration) was compared with natural zooplankton communities in control enclosures. No significant treatment effects on zooplankton communities were detected, even at 3 times the expected environmental concentration. While some changes in community structure of crustacean zooplankton in enclosures occurred through the season, these did not appear to be related to the tebufenozide treatments.

J	NUMMI, P; POYSA, H				NUMMI, P; POYSA, H			HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS OF DUCKS DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE BREEDING-SEASON	ECOGRAPHY												Habitat use of mallard Anas platyrhynchos, teal A. crecca, wigeon A. penelope and goldeneye Bucephala clangula was studied in southern Finland during 1988-1991. Emphasis included evaluation of the importance of food and vegetation structure and revealing of the patterns of habitat use throughout the breeding season. Average lake scores of pairs, broods, and juveniles of all species were on the luxuriant end of a principal component analysis axis describing habitat structure. A more detailed examination, however, revealed clear differences in habitat distributions both between and within species. Generally, habitat distributions seemed to shift toward the luxuriant from pairs to broods. However, goldeneye juveniles used both the most luxuriant and the poorest habitats more than expected. When all phases of the breeding cycle are considered, habitat luxuriance seemed to be more important for dabbling ducks and nektonic invertebrates more important for the goldeneye. Emerging insects were most important to the teal.

J	KOLDING, J				KOLDING, J			POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND LIFE-HISTORY STYLES OF NILE TILAPIA, OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS, IN FERGUSON GULF, LAKE TURKANA, KENYA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Three observed dynamic aspects of the Nile tilapia population around Ferguson's Gulf at Lake Turkana, Kenya are evaluated and discussed: the seasonality in catch rates, the enormous inter-annual abundance variations, and the large changes in median size at first maturity. A clear understanding of the regulating mechanisms behind these features has never been achieved, although seasonal changes in the hydrology of shallow sheltered refuges seems to play an important role. This paper suggests a further holistic approach taking the impacts and interrelationships of both the primary productivity and the various predators into account. A synthesizing ecological hypothesis is elaborated, which concludes that most observations on the tilapia dynamics can be explained from changes in the oxygen concentrations and size-specific mortality pressures. Variations in these two proximate factors can ultimately be explained by the floodplain-type fluctuations in the Ferguson's Gulf environment.

In order to assess the extent of this variability within an individual lake, the distribution and architecture of Myriophyllum spicatum was measured on five dates during 1990 in Fish Lake, Wisconsin. These data were used to develop an index of plant habitat quality and quantity to describe 1) horizontal visibility within macrophyte beds, 2) the amount of shading afforded by the surface canopy, 3) the amount of available habitat for macroinvertebrate attachment, 4) the relative amount of protection afforded fish by the plants, and 5) the degree of crowding or compaction among plants. The methodology employed in developing this index could be adaptable to other aquatic plants. Temporal changes in the architecture of M. spicatum during the growing season and differences in architecture within one macrophyte bed in Fish Lake were substantial and may have influenced habitat use by fish and macroinvertebrates.																			0270-5060					JUN	1992	7	2					113	125		10.1080/02705060.1992.9664677	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1992.9664677													WOS:A1992JG36900002

Climate Sensitivity of Phosphorus Loadings to an Urban Stream	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We investigate the sensitivity of phosphorus loading (mass/time) in an urban stream to variations in climate using nondimensional sensitivity, known as elasticity, methods commonly used by economists and hydrologists. Previous analyses have used bivariate elasticity methods to represent the general relationship between nutrient loading and a variable of interest, but such bivariate relations cannot reflect the complex multivariate nonlinear relationships inherent among nutrients, precipitation, temperature, and streamflow. Using fixed-effect multivariate regression methods, we obtain two phosphorus models (nonparametric and parametric) for an urban stream with high explanatory power that can both estimate phosphorus loads and the elasticity of phosphorus loading to changes in precipitation, temperature, and streamflow. A case study demonstrates total phosphorus loading depends significantly on season, rainfall, combined sewer overflow events, and flow rate, yet the elasticity of total phosphorus to all these factors remains relatively constant throughout the year. The elasticity estimates reported here can be used to examine how nutrient loads may change under future climate conditions.

J	Wilde, GR; Pope, KL				Wilde, GR; Pope, KL			Relationship between lake-record weights of fishes and reservoir area and growing season	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We used information from an angler recognition program to assess the relationship between lake-record weights of freshwater fishes captured by Texas anglers and two predictors of fish production and growth: reservoir surface area and growing-season length. The lake-record weights of two species, large-mouth bass Micropterus salmoides and flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris, were directly related to the logarithm of surface area. The record weights of all species studied were unrelated to growing-season length. Regardless of the statistical significance of individual correlations, there was a significant excess of positive correlations across all species between lake-record weights of fish and log surface area. This indicates the presence of a general relationship between the record weights of fish and reservoir area. Our results suggest that record weights of fish may be constrained by reservoir surface area.

J	Punning, JM; Leeben, A				Punning, JM; Leeben, A			A comparison of sediment and monitoring data: Implications for paleomonitoring a small lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Long-term limnological monitoring data (from 1971 to 2001) were compared with sediment core record in Lake Viitna Linajarv (hereafter L. Viitna), a small lake in northern Estonia. The monitoring data show that L. Viitna changed from mesotrophic in the 1970s to eutrophic in the 1990s. The trends of paleodata that integrate the changes in the biogeochemical matter cycling in the lake over 2-3 years have clear signals about changes in the state of the ecosystem in L. Viitna during the last decades. A gradual increase in organic productivity should reflect a greater oxygen demand in the hypolimnion. As a result the hypolimnion became seasonally anoxic earlier and its pH level remained low for a longer time. These fundamental changes near the sediment-water interface were recorded in the sediment core. The greatest changes occurred at the beginning of the 1980s (layers at a depth of ca. 20 cm), when the meso(eu?) trophic conditions in L. Viitna started to become increasingly more eutrophic. The variations of paleorecords in the upper part of the sediment core coincide temporally with changes in the water level of the lake.																			0167-6369					NOV	2003	89	1					1	13		10.1023/A:1025825823319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025825823319								14609271					WOS:000185514100001

In this paper we discuss a set of short-term triple-nested regional model simulations of the meteorological effects of the Fucino Lake on the surrounding region. We find that the model simulates realistic lake-breeze circulations and their response to background winds. The simulations indicate that the lake affects the temperature of the surrounding basin in all seasons and precipitation in the cold season, when cyclonic perturbations move across the region. Some effects of the lake also extend over areas quite far from the Fucino basin. Our results support the hypothesis that the drainage of the lake might have significantly affected the climate of the lake basin. However, longer simulations and further development in some aspects of the model are needed, in order to provide a more statistically robust evaluation of the simulated lake-effects.					; Giorgi, Filippo/C-3169-2013; Tomassetti, Barbara/HWQ-5080-2023	Verdecchia, Marco/0000-0002-5134-9128; Tomassetti, Barbara/0000-0003-2035-6306													0992-7689	1432-0576				NOV	2003	21	11					2219	2232		10.5194/angeo-21-2219-2003	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/angeo-21-2219-2003													WOS:000189047700009

This has been interpreted as evidence of heavy predation on the algae, although the impact of this predation has never been determined experimentally. We determined the vertical and seasonal distribution of the alga Cryptormonas phaseolus and its most relevant predators, the ciliates Coleps sp. and Prorodon sp., forming metalimnetic maxima in Lake Cis6. On several dates, in situ feeding rates of ciliates were determined by three independent methods: (i) epifluorescence counts of ingested algal cells together with estimates of the food turnover rime of the ciliates; (ii) in situ incubations with radioactively labeled algae; (iii) HPLC determination of alloxanthine content in the predator size fraction. Feeding rates varied between 0.07 and 0.64 Cryptomonas ciliate(-1) h(-1). We then calculated integrated predation on the algae. using the functional response of the ciliates and the vertical distribution of each population. We found that even though the ciliates were always food saturated, their predation impact on Cryptomonas was not very large: as an average, 5-25% of the biomass of Cryptomonas was removed daily by the ciliates. Finally, we studied the effects of the diel vertical movements of these populations on predation impact. By migrating into the sulfide-rich hypolimnion during the night, Cryptomonas could reduce its predation losses by 38%. Thus, the algae were protected from predation during several hours of each diel cycle and maintained a very large biomass throughout stratification, although this resulted in a very slow growth. Slow growth, coupled to large biomass, seems to be a general feature of metalimnetic accumulations of organisms.

Two hundred and fifty water samples, most of them obtained from minifilters installed in deep borings to a depth of 24 meter below the soil surface, were analyzed for macro-ions, EC(25) and pH. The hydrochemical results were compared with simulated flow paths and with the results of isotope analysis (H-3 and O-18). The simulation of the groundwater flow paths showed that the inflow of seepage water was only possible when the slack was flooded. Under such conditions groundwater exfiltrates in the upgradient part of the slack, proceeds as surface water to finally pass through the anaerobic slack bottom in the downgradient infiltration part of the slack. The CO2 producing plant roots and the microbial population in the bottom sediments create a groundwater type, which is highly reduced and aggressive toward calcareous substrates in the subsoil. The distribution of the H-3 and O-18 isotopes was in accordance with the simulated groundwater flow pattern, illustrating a modest seepage intensity in the flow-through lake. A lowering of the water table in the surroundings of the slack during the last decades had weakened the above mentioned hydrological mechanism to the extent that at present the bicarbonate groundwater can only enter the slack during short periods in the wet season. These results suggest that the decline of endangered basiphilous slack species in the slack is caused by a decrease in acid buffering capacity of the slack.

These trained networks were then able to predict seasonal changes in sulphate, hydrogen, nitrate, and ammonium ion concentrations caused by projected decreases in sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants in the eastern United States. Results showed that by 2010 the proposed reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions by the U.S. electric power utilities would just be sufficient to reduce acid rain conditions to the levels where human health problems are avoided. However, pollution from acid rain would still be impacting considerable regions of the north-eastern United States and south-eastern Canada causing other environmental damage such as loss of fish in acidic lakes.																			1496-2551					MAR	2003	2	2					99	109		10.1139/S03-006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/S03-006													WOS:000220261700002

On average, the number of opaque bands counted in the shell interior was greater than the number of opaque bands counted on the shell exterior. The number of annually produced opaque bands, distinguished from disturbance bands by their position within the seasonal cycle of delta(18)O in the shell, agreed with the number of bands counted in polished interior sections. Opaque bands caused by nonannual events were either not continuous from the growing edge to the umbo, or not continuous until they merged into and with other bands near the pallial line. The counting of the internal opaque bands, using the procedures described in this study, provided the best estimate of the true age of Elliptio complanata.																			0706-652X					FEB	1996	53	2					372	379		10.1139/cjfas-53-2-372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-2-372													WOS:A1996UK63200016

However, multifactorial studies conducted on epiphyton on the same substrate across a spectrum of environmental parameters are very limited. Here, we present first complex field study on the role of abiotic and biotic factors in shaping the species richness, diversity, abundance, and biomass composition of epiphyton on common reed in four shallow lakes with different trophic status, water and fish management, and the abundance and structure of potential algal grazers: littoral crustaceans and fish. The obtained results revealed that the algal taxa richness was the lowest in the hypertrophic lake and the highest in the meso-eutrophic lake. Epiphyton abundance (predominated by pennate diatoms) and biomass were found to be the highest in eutrophic water bodies. Biomass consisted primarily of diatoms, but we found the seasonal predominance of filamentous Chlorophyta (in the eutrophic lakes) and Chlorophyceae (in the meso-eutrophic lake). Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the frequency of water level fluctuations was the most significant variable in the composition of epiphyton. RDA also revealed the importance of grazing pressure of fish. Thus, in hydrologically transformed lakes, man-made factors may be of great relevance in the development of epiphytic algae.

J	WANG, Y				WANG, Y			EFFECTS OF BLOCKING ANTICYCLONES IN EURASIA IN THE RAINY SEASON (MEIYU BAIU SEASON)	JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN												Distribution of BAs in Eurasia during the Meiyu/Baiu season and some possible influences of BAs on the behavior of the MB frontal zone were examined through statistical analyses. Then detailed analyses were made for a case in late June 1982. BAs appear with higher frequency in the regions of 31-60-degrees-E, 91-110-degrees-E and 131-150-degrees-E in the latitudes of 50-70-degrees-N. The maximum frequency is frond in the region of 131-150-degrees-E. The appearance frequency of BAs in region of 50-70-degrees-N/81-120-degrees-E (Region B) showed a positive significant correlation with the persistency of the Baiu period in Japan. On the other hand, the appearance frequency of BAs in the region of 50-70-degrees-N/121-160-degrees-E (Region C) showed a positive correlation with both the persistency of the Meiyu period and the rainfall amount during that period in Central China. A statistical analysis suggests that the existence of cold air in the lower layer in 32.5-35-degrees-N/112.5-117.5-degrees-E (corresponding to the area just to the north of the Meiyu front), largely associated with a BA in Region C, is an important factor in activating the Meiyu front in Central China, and in enhancing the lowlevel southerly wind component in South China. A case study for June 1982 showed that the cold air intrusion toward Central China in the situation of Type C occurs mainly in the lower layer, and is accompanied by the development of a baroclinic instability wave around 50-degrees-N/100-110-degrees-E. The formation of the Type C situation is a favorable condition for cold air coming southward to the Meiyu frontal zone. On the other hand, there was a Rossby wave-like (height) anomaly pattern propagating from the Okhotsk Sea to the tropics through Japan shown by the presence of a BA in Region C in June. Although forcing processes have not been clarified yet, a case study in late June 1982 suggests that the wave was amplified around the Lake Baikal to the Okhotsk Sea area. The propagation might results in a negative anomaly of geopotential height at 500 mb level to the east of Japan, a southward shift of the Baiu front and weakening (or southward shift of) the sub-tropical high in nearby regions. The present paper shows the different effects of the Type C stiuation on climatological features of the Meiyu front from those of the Baiu front.																			0026-1165	2186-9057				OCT	1992	70	5					929	951		10.2151/jmsj1965.70.5_929	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj1965.70.5_929													WOS:A1992KB85800006

The end product of the overall transformation reaction can be arsenite [As(III)] or methylated arsenic. Field and laboratory data suggest a strong correlation between the end product of the reaction and the growth rate of the algae, with As(III) only produced during log (exponential., fast) growth. The result is a peak in As(III) concentration preceding or coincident with the algal bloom. This paper analyzes data from 18 different water bodies (five lakes, one river, six estuary/marine sites, six experimental sites). Algal blooms, As(III) peaks and algal blooms with preceding or coincident As(III) peaks were identified. In total, 80 algal blooms were identified, 49 (61%) of which were associated with As(III) peaks. In 78% of water bodies algal blooms were typically (> 50%) associated with As(III) peaks.

Spatial variation of the vegetation was considered mainly in relation to soil and topographic characteristics. The 5,946 m(2) study area extended along a transect from the bank of the Parana River across the floodplain, passing through a lake. Phytosociological analysis were performed for 36 plots, each 150 m(2). Subanalysis were performed for 300 m(2) zones. Soil characteristics and topographic profile and their relationship to the vegetation were analyzed. Hydrodynamic and sediment processes were the most important factors in vegetation establishment and succession, determining species selection and formation and evolution of the substrate. These processes and their local spatial variability fundamentally affected the dynamics, structure, and patterns of distribution.																			1516-8913	1678-4324					2000	43	2					185	194		10.1590/S1516-89132000000200008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1516-89132000000200008													WOS:000088171800008
J	Mohamed, ZA; Carmichael, WW				Mohamed, ZA; Carmichael, WW			Seasonal variation in microcystin levels of river Nile water at Sohag City, Egypt	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The river Nile is the main source of drinking water in Egypt. Nutrient loading coupled with year-round warm weather favor the growth of cyanobacteria, several of which can produce cyanotoxins, especially the potent liver toxins called microcystins. Most microcystin resides inside or closely attached to cyanobacteria cells, and are released into the water column as cells lyse from senescence or chemical treatment. The present study evaluated microcystin levels, as measured by immunoassay (ELISA), in both raw and finished drinking water of the river Nile, during the warm season (May-October), near the drinking water intake for Sohag City, Egypt. The results showed that microcystin content within the cells correlated better with type of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria (Gomphosphaeria, Microcystis, Oscillatoria) rather than chlorophyll a. Microcystin concentration in cell-free water correlated significantly with that measured within the cells, with maximum values being recorded in September (0.4-0.78 mug l(-1)). Microcystin levels in the finished drinking water were low (56.1- 87.1 ng l(-1)) and were detected only in May and June. The study indicates that microcystin is present in the raw and finished drinking water at Sohag City but that levels did not exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guideline level of 1 mug l(-1) during May-October 1999.																			0003-4088						2000	36	4					227	234		10.1051/limn/2000020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2000020													WOS:000166344500002
J	RHOADES, C				RHOADES, C			SEASONAL PATTERN OF NITROGEN MINERALIZATION AND SOIL-MOISTURE BENEATH FAIDHERBIA-ALBIDA (SYN ACACIA-ALBIDA) IN CENTRAL MALAWI	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												On fertile alluvial soils on the lakeshore plain of Malawi, maize (Zea mays L.) yields beneath canopies of large Faidherbia albida (syn Acacia albida) trees greatly exceed those found beyond tree canopies, yet there is little difference in soil nutrients or organic matter. To investigate the possibility that soil nutrient dynamics contribute to increased maize yields, this study focused on the impact of Faidherbia albida on nitrogen mineralization and soil moisture from the time of crop planting until harvest. Both large and small trees were studied to consider whether tree effects change as trees mature. During the first month of the rainy season, a seven-fold difference in net N mineralization was recorded beneath large tree canopies compared to rates measured in open sites. The initial pulse beneath the trees was 60 mu g N g(-1) in the top 15 cm of soil. During the rest of the cropping cycle, N availability was 1.5 to 3 times higher beneath tree canopies than in open sites. The total production of N for the 4-month study period was 112 mu g N g(-1) below tree canopies compared to 42 mu g N g(-1) beyond the canopies. Soil moisture in the 0-15 cm soil layer was higher under the influence of the tree canopies. The canopy versus open site difference grew from 4% at the beginning of the season to 50% at the end of the cropping season. Both N mineralization and soil moisture were decreased below young trees. Hence, the impact of F. albida on these soil properties changes with tree age and size. While maize yields were not depressed beneath young F. albida, it is important to realize that the full benefits of this traditional agroforestry system may require decades to develop.																			0167-4366						1995	29	2					133	145		10.1007/BF00704882	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00704882													WOS:A1995RJ11100004

In order to evaluate the capacity of these two fishes to decrease algal blooms, diel feeding samplings were carried out in May (without algal blooms) and September (with algal blooms) in 2005. Based on estimated food consumption by the Elliott-Persson model, silver carp increased daily food consumption from 2.07 g dry weight per 100 g wet body weight in May before the outbreak of algal blooms to 4.98 g dry weight per 100 g wet body weight in September during algal blooms outbreak. However, no obvious variation of food consumption was observed in bighead carp during the study period. This species 1.88 and 1.54 g dry weight of plankton per 100 g wet body weight in May and September, respectively. Silver carp had a higher feeding capacity for plankton than bighead carp. Biotic factors (i.e., fish size and conspecific competition with natural species in the lake) may affect the feeding behaviors of both carps as well as seasonal variation of plankton communities in the pen.

J	Lindström, M; Håkanson, L				Lindström, M; Håkanson, L			A model to calculate heavy metal load to lakes dominated by urban runoff and diffuse inflow	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Lakes act as natural integrators. Metal loads from different sources are collected and integrated in water and sediments. This may be used as a basis for a dynamic model to calculate heavy metal inflow to lakes without main tributary inflows. In this paper, a mass-balance model for calculation of annual metal loads to lakes dominated by diffuse inflow and urban runoff is presented. Metal concentrations in urban runoff varies very much, a phenomenon generally called the 'first flush'. In the lake, the variations are smoothed, which makes it possible to get a more stable flow assessment. Ten lakes in Stockholm (the capital of Sweden) have been investigated for water and surface sediment concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn). The model accounts for inflow, outflow and sediment interactions (sediment resuspension is modelled using new approaches). It is meant to describe water and sediment concentrations as accurately as possible. An uncertainty test was carried out to rank the influence of the uncertainty of different parts of the model for the total uncertainty in modelled water and sediment concentrations. The most important factors for the uncertainty of model predictions were the settling velocity of particulate matter, the percentage A-areas (accumulation areas for fine particles) and the dissolved fraction of the total metal concentration. Metals accumulating in the deeper (geological) sediments may be considered as removed from the biosphere and a flux to the geosphere. Hg was found to accumulate the most in the sediments followed by Pb; least accumulating were Ni and Cr. High correlations between metal accumulation and phosphorous and nitrogen concentrations indicated that the autochthonous lake production was a crucial factor for the accumulation of metals in the sediments. Significant influences of lake morphometry (resuspension) and water pH (metal particle association) on the sediment accumulation could also be noted. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Riise, JC; Roos, N				Riise, JC; Roos, N			Benthic metabolism and the effects of bioturbation in a fertilised polyculture fish pond in northeast Thailand	AQUACULTURE					International Carp Symposium	SEP 06-09, 1993	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY					Benthic metabolism and the effects of bioturbation were investigated during the dry season from December to March in a tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) dominated polyculture fish pond in northeast Thailand. Benthic metabolic fluxes were measured by incubating intact sediment cores sampled in the pond. Oxygen uptake showed significant temporal variations from 15.4 to 52.3 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1), averaging 31.9 +/- 15.0 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1). Total carbon dioxide release showed similar temporal variations from 43.0 to 127.8 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1), averaging 68.6 +/- 36.9 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) (n = 6). The community respiratory quotient (RQ = CO2/O-2; range 1.1-3.5, average 2.3 +/- 0.9, n = 6) indicated significant anaerobic mineralisation. Oxygen uptake by the sediment corresponded to 8% of the oxygen respired by the planktonic community. Ammonia release averaged 13.2 +/- 4.8 mmol NH4+ m(-2) day(-1) (n = 4). A new method using the stable N-15 isotope technique for measuring denitrification was introduced. Rates of denitrification averaged 4.1 +/- 0.85 mmol N m(-2) day(-1) (n = 3). Denitrification was insignificant in the mineralisation of organic matter, but caused atmospheric loss of nitrogen, averaging 16% of the loading by commercial fertiliser and manure. The net sedimentation of particulate organic matter in the pond was 5 cm year(-1). The burial of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) averaged 25% and 60% of the gross input, respectively. The effects of fish and benthic fauna on the benthic metabolism were studied by excluding the fish from 0.5 m(2) of the pond bottom for 6 weeks, The sediment was dominated by small oligochaetes less than 10 mm long and the exclusion experiment indicated a high predation on the benthic fauna. Oligochaete numbers and biomass as well as benthic metabolic rates were significantly higher when fish were excluded from the sediment. Inside the exclosure, the RQ was approximately the double that outside, indicating that the exclusion of fish from the sediment increased the sediment flux of metabolites and the anaerobic respiration, including the denitrification process. The presence of benthivorous fish reduced the atmospheric nitrogen loss caused by denitrification by 50%. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Death, RG				Death, RG			The effect of habitat stability on benthic invertebrate communities: The utility of species abundance distributions	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Spatial and temporal patterns in the species abundance distribution of benthic invertebrate communities of 11 freshwater habitats (10 streams and a wind-swept lake shore) were examined with respect to habitat stability. Abundance patterns varied markedly between seasons at most sites. However, mean abundance distributions at 4 of the 5 unstable sites and the 2 most stable sites were dominated by one or two taxa with a large number of rare species, whereas sites of intermediate stability had more equitable distributions. Both the log series and log normal distributions were statistically indistinguishable, at the 5% level, from all the observed mean abundance patterns. In contrast, graphical comparisons of the observed and fitted distributions suggested the log series may be the better fit at most of the unstable sites and the two most stable sites, whereas the more equitable distribution at sites of intermediate stability suggested the log normal distribution was the better fit. If conditions at a site favoured one or two species, either through severe physical conditions, or through competitive superiority in the absence of disturbance then the log series distribution may result. However, if no species in the community was strongly advantaged over others, a log normal distribution should result. Given the discriminating power of the appropriate statistical test it may not, however, be possible to pick up these differences without graphical comparisons as well.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 12	1996	317	2					97	107		10.1007/BF00018733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018733													WOS:A1996TY88100002
J	MCCARTHY, TS; STANISTREET, IG; CAIRNCROSS, B				MCCARTHY, TS; STANISTREET, IG; CAIRNCROSS, B			THE SEDIMENTARY DYNAMICS OF ACTIVE FLUVIAL CHANNELS ON THE OKAVANGO FAN, BOTSWANA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The 1800-km2 Okavango alluvial fan of northern Botswana represents an unusual depositional setting in which peat-forming perennial swamps (6000 km2) occur in a region of aeolian and semi-arid sedimentation within an incipient graben of the East African Rift. A channel system distributes water and sediment on the fan surface but cannot contain seasonal flood water, which spreads laterally from the channels through permeable channel margins, sustaining the flanking swamps. All sediment introduced is deposited on the fan. A detailed study of sediment movement and associated hydrological conditions in the channels was undertaken to examine sediment dispersal. Bedload greatly exceeds suspended load (at least by a factor of four). Vegetation and peat form permeable levees which confine the channels. In the upper reaches, two-way exchange of water occurs between channel and swamp depending on the season, but on the fan itself, channels lose water to the swamp. Bedload measurements reveal that the channel system is in a state of grade disequilibrium, with interspersed depositional and erosional reaches. Deposition of most of the incoming bedload occurs on the upper portion of the fan in a meandering and anastomosed channel system, but on the midfan, deposition of bedload occurs by channel-bed aggradation, at a rate of up to 5 cm yr-1. Further down slope, the channel enters a large lake where all remaining bedload is deposited. The presently observed sedimentation patterns may be due to a recent disturbance of the fluvial system, either by avulsion or neotectonics.

Front-line feature stories by George Grebenstchikoff in the newspaper "Zhizn Altaya" in 1916	SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL												The authors present and analyse the reports sent by George Grebenstchikoff to the newspaper Zhizn Altaya from the theatre of World War I where he served as a volunteer. The reports are regarded as a milestone in the life and work of the writer when he was searching for his creative identity, personal writing style and as the expression of his civil and philosophical standpoints formed before the war. Grebenstchikoff writes from a position of a man being at war and writing the letters home, with the author's creative method being ethnographic observation. In the reports, the writer is acting as an organizer of frontline life, a head of the "bath squad", a novice writer and a journalist-in-action who is telling his compatriots about the frontline life at World War I. The blend of these functions resulted in the original series of wartime articles in the newspaper "Zhizn Altaya" in 1916. The War by Grebenstchikoff is tiresome and troublesome; it implies mud, parasites, decay and damp. It is a certain soulless and destructive power, the disaster which had split life into two spatial and temporal dimensions: "here/there", "now/then". It is shown as evil, mechanic, and hideous monster with an iron walk and iron spits. The monster is reeking, rumbling, breaking, devastating and uglifying the nature, wounding and murdering people. The War is breaking people's lives, dragging them from home, changing their social statuses and functions. Siberia is the antithesis of the war. It is another dimension where one can find relief and solace, source of life-affirmation and spiritual cleansing. Siberia is fragrant, colourful, mellifluous and beautiful disregarding the season. It is the best place on the Earth. Everything is full of wonders here: lakes and rivers, fields and mountains, forests and steppes. The author is the participant of the events, who is actively involved in wartime life and men-of-arms community. The author's emotions and opinions make him neither pro-or antiwar journalist. He is a chronicler. He does not show battles, attacks, enemies, targets, pathos, offensives and retreats, gifted or giftless commanders. The author is the ethnographer whose main tasks are to watch and to observe. It totally agrees with the tradition of the ethnographic feature article "Altaian Rus" (1913) where Grebenstchikoff is a watcher, a scientist, a journalist and a writer simultaneously.

A low concentration (1.5 mg/L active ingredient) of the herbicide endothall formulated as Aquathol((R)) K was used in 2000 to attempt to selectively control the Eurasian watermilfoil. Aquatic plant biomass and frequency data were collected before treatment, ten weeks after treatment and during the growing season for 3 additional years. Macrophyte data were analyzed to assess the herbicide's impacts on Eurasian watermilfoil as well as the rest of the aquatic plant community. Results showed a significant decrease in Eurasian watermilfoil biomass and frequency 10 weeks after treatment. The Eurasian watermilfoil continued to be present, but at a significantly reduced level through the remainder of the study (3 years after treatment). Of the native plant species, large-leaf pondweed (Potamogeton amplifolius Tucker.) frequency and biomass was significantly reduced after treatment. Common elodea (Elodea canadensis Rich.), muskgrass (Chara sp. Vallaint.) and bladderwort (Utricularia sp. L.) all increased significantly after treatment.																			0146-6623					JUL	2004	42						109	114																WOS:000227098900007
J	Martin, AJ; Calvert, SE				Martin, AJ; Calvert, SE			Hydrological and geochemical controls governing the distribution of trace metals in a mine-impacted lake	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Factors controlling the distribution of mining-derived Cu, Pb and Zn in the waters and bottom sediments of a large Andean lake (Lago Junin, Peru) have been assessed based on sample collections in May/June 1997 (dry season) and February/March 1998 (wet season). Relatively low levels of trace metals detected in surface waters of the lake during the dry season contrasted greatly with the high values observed during the wet period. Dry season concentrations of total Zn, Cu and Pb in the central lake basin averaged 41, 4.4 and 0.24 mug/L, respectively. In contrast, the respective wet season concentrations of total Zn, Cu and Pb in areas of the main basin ranged up to 387, 52 and 40 mug/L. The seasonal variability in metal concentrations largely reflects an increase in the concentration of particulate metal phases during the wet season. Such observations can be attributed to changes in sediment loadings associated with mining-derived river inputs and changes in lake circulation resulting from hydroelectric dam operations. Surface sediments are characterized by lake-wide enrichments of Zn, Cu and Pb, with maximum concentrations reaching as high as 5, 0.25 and 0.7 wt%; respectively. Estimated rates of authigenic metal accumulation are not sufficient to account for the elevated metal concentrations in the main basin of the lake, indicating that metal distributions are governed by the accumulation of metal-rich particulates. Variations in the spatial distributions of Zn, Cu and Pb are suggested to be a function of varying host phases and textural sorting.																			0943-0105					FEB	2003	43	4					408	418		10.1007/s00254-002-0650-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-002-0650-8													WOS:000183163900004
J	Whigham, PA; Dick, G; Recknagel, R				Whigham, PA; Dick, G; Recknagel, R			Exploring seasonal patterns using process modelling and evolutionary computation	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					3rd Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Informatics (ISEI)	AUG   26, 2002	Rome, ITALY	Int Soc Ecol Informat				Process models of chlorophyll-a concentration for freshwater systems, and in particular lake environments, have been developed over many years. Previous work has demonstrated that the optimisation of constants within these models has been able to significantly improve the quality of the resulting model on unseen data. This paper explores two properties of one particular process model: can the model predictions be improved by optimising the constants over different temporal scales; and can seasonal patterns be identified, based on monthly training scales, that allow further understanding of the response of the freshwater system to changing environmental conditions. The results show that there is some improvement on the prediction of unseen data when using constants of the process model optimised for individual months, versus constants trained over a yearly cycle. Additionally, by studying the patterns of the constants over various time scales some underlying seasonal patterns can be observed. These patterns can be further studied by exploring how the various elements of the process model vary with monthly versus yearly training constants. This work demonstrates some possible directions for understanding how the behaviour of freshwater systems at different time scales can be used to understand the properties of these complexes, non-linear systems. The results also suggest that local models of ecological time series data can be used to extract information that may not be obtainable from a single, global model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Havens, KE; East, TL				Havens, KE; East, TL			Carbon dynamics in the 'grazing food chain' of a subtropical lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Studies were conducted over a 13 month period at four pelagic sites in eutrophic Lake Okeechobee, Florida (USA), in order to quantify carbon (C) uptake rates by size-fractionated phytoplankton, and subsequent transfers of C to zooplankton. This was accomplished using laboratory C-14 tracer methods and natural plankton assemblages. The annual biomass of picoplankton (<2 mu m), nanoplankton (2-20 mu m) and microplankton (>20 mu m) averaged 60, 389 and 100 mu g C l(-1), respectively, while corresponding rates of C uptake averaged 7, 51 and 13 mu g C l(-1) h(-1). The biomass of microzooplankton (40-200 mu m) and macrozooplankton (>200 mu m) averaged 18 and 60 mu g C l(-1), respectively, while C uptake rates by these herbivore groups averaged 2 and 3 mu g C l(-1) h(-1). There were no strong seasonal patterns in any of the plankton metrics. The ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton C uptake averaged 7% over the course of the study. This low value is typical of that observed in eutrophic temperate lakes with small zooplankton and large inedible phytoplankton, and indicates ineffective C transfer in the grazing food chain. On a single occasion, there was a high density (>40 l(-1)) of Daphnia lumholtzii, a large-bodied exotic cladoceran. At that time, zooplankton community C uptake was >20 mu g C l(-1) h(-1), and the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton C uptake was near 30%. If D.lumholtzii proliferates in Lake Okeechobee and the other Florida lakes where it has recently been observed, it may substantially alter planktonic C dynamics.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														0142-7873					NOV	1997	19	11					1687	1711		10.1093/plankt/19.11.1687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.11.1687													WOS:000071169900007

Habitat selection was investigated at three levels: beach, territory, and nest site. Nest beaches had significantly more gravel substrate than non-nest beaches (F-[1,F-11] = 21.52, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in width between nest and non-nest beaches. All Piping Plover nests were located on gravel, though this substrate only accounted for approximately 43% of nest beach area. Nest sites were significantly farther from the nearest water (F-[1,F-181] = 12.24, p < 0.01), the main water body (F-[1,F-181] = 6.55, p < 0.05), and had significantly more stones (F-[1,F-161] = 10.98, p < 0.01) and rocks (Z = 2.93, p < 0.01) than random sites. Distance to the nearest water source, number of stones per square metre, and distance to the vegetation line were the three variables used by the stepwise discriminant function analysis to correctly classify 41.8% of nest sites and 87.1% of random sites. This was still significantly better than chance (Z = 3.66, p < 0.01). The low percentage of correctly classified nest sites may indicate that some plovers at this lake used nest sites on lower quality substrate. Flooded nests were significantly closer to water than successful nests and depredated nests were closer to the vegetation line than successful nests.

J	SCHEFFER, M; BAKEMA, AH; WORTELBOER, FG				SCHEFFER, M; BAKEMA, AH; WORTELBOER, FG			MEGAPLANT - A SIMULATION-MODEL OF THE DYNAMICS OF SUBMERGED PLANTS	AQUATIC BOTANY												A generic simulation model for the dynamics of submerged macrophytes is presented, called MEGAPLANT ('Model Evaluating General Aquatic Pland Laws And New Theories'). Although the model is kept relatively simple, it includes many aspects that have an effect on vegetation dynamics during the seasonal cycle, such as grazing, overwintering strategies, wave action and seed dispersal. The characteristics of both the plant and the environment can be adjusted by the user. The model is meant as an aid to enhance insight into the interplay of processes that influence vegetation dynamics. As an example, it is used to analyze mechanisms that determine the survival of vegetation in turbid eutrophic lakes. The following results were found. (1) Hot spots of propagule-producing vegetation can permanently maintain vegetation stands at sites that would otherwise be devoid of macrophytes. (2) Moderate fluctuations in environmental factors that normally have little impact on the vegetation can cause large year-to-year fluctuations in biomass of vegetation growing under suboptimal conditions. (3) Grazing by herbivores such as coots can cause the existence of two alternative stable states: under-exploited and overgrazed. This implies that herbivores may prevent the recovery of submerged macrophytes in lakes that are recovering from eutrophication, but also that temporary exclusion of herbivores can trigger permanent recovery of the vegetation. It is shown that the quantitative simulation results are sensitive to the setting of several parameters but that the qualitative results presented are quite robust against changes in parameter setting. It is argued that although the prospects of accurate predictive simulation of aquatic vegetation are poor, relatively simple models like the one presented can be a useful tool to improve the theoretical framework for understanding the dominant mechanisms regulating submerged plant dynamics.

Measuring the net economic value of recreational boating as water levels fluctuate	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The purpose of this article was to show how the value of recreational boating can be assessed and how that value can be linked to water levels. Data were gathered via a survey of recreational boaters to determine days boated and willingness-to-pay (net economic value) for boating on Lake Ontario and on the St. Lawrence River in 2002. Depth measurements were taken at marinas and yacht clubs, boat launch ramps, and private docks. Stage-damage curves were used to pinpoint at what water levels and to what extent boaters would be impacted. Boaters recreated an estimated 1.3 million days in 2002 and spent an estimated US$178 million in New York counties bordering Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. The mean net economic value per day per boat (above current expenditures) was $69.36, with an estimated total net economic value of US$90 million. Using Lake Ontario as an example, the stage-damage curves show that the overall negative impact would be small, between 245 and 248 ft. Maintaining water levels within that range for the entire boating season would be ideal for Lake Ontario boaters and associated businesses.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2007	43	4					1016	1023		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00083.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00083.x													WOS:000248682400017

J	BURKHARDT, S				BURKHARDT, S			SEASONAL SIZE VARIATION IN THE PREDATORY CLADOCERAN BYTHOTREPHES CEDERSTROEMII IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Dry weight, body length and spine length were measured for the exotic cladoceran Byrhotrephes cederstroemii collected from offshore and inshore stations in southeastern Lake Michigan. Average dry weight of each developmental stage exhibited seasonal variation by a factor of more than 5. 2. Mean dry weight of Bythotrephes was closely correlated with water temperature. Contrary to the inverse relationship between water temperature and body size frequently observed for other invertebrates, the dry weight of Bythotrephes increased at higher ambient temperatures. 3. No significant correlation was observed between abundances of major zooplankton taxa and the dry weight of Bythotrephes. An indirect effect of temperature on prey consumption may cause seasonal variation in dry weight of Bythotrephes in Lake Michigan. 4. Distances between adjacent pairs of barbs, added to the caudal spine with each moult; are significantly shorter in Bythotrephes which produce resting eggs. Less material investment in the exoskeleton of sexually reproducing females was observed in favour of growth and reproduction.																			0046-5070					FEB	1994	31	1					97	108		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb00842.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb00842.x													WOS:A1994MV70100009
J	Mousa, SA; Mousa, MA				Mousa, SA; Mousa, MA			Immunocytochemical and histological studies on the hypophyseal-gonadal system in the freshwater Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), during sexual maturation and spawning in different habitats	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY												The activities of the hypophyseal-gonadal system of O. niloticus in different habitats were investigated using immunocytochemical and histological techniques. The observed physicochemical results indicated that Lake Nasser water characteristics are within the allowed and desired safety baseline levels. In contrast, Lake Manzalah exhibited high levels of Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42- and heavy metals (Zn, Pb, and Cd). These water conditions affected the activity of the hypophyseal-gonadal axis of tilapia. The secretory and the synthetic activities of GTH and SL cells in the pituitary gland, in general, underwent obvious normal changes during gonad maturation and spawning of O. niloticus in Lake Nasser. In Lake Manzalah, the secretory activity of GTH and SL cells declined. This may be due to the effect of the high levels of heavy metals which interfere with the release of hormones and disturb the feedback mechanisms. In addition, the activity of both PRL and GH cells in Lake Nasser was higher than that of Lake Manzalah, but the synthetic activity of the ACTH and MSH cells was higher in Lake Manzalah. This may be related to the increased stress on fishes and the dark polluted water in Lake Manzalah. Both the environmental and the endocrine impacts in Lake Manzalah caused a decline in the gonadal activity as reflected by the decrease of sperm amount in the ripe testis, the appearance of oocytes in the testis and the degeneration of ripe oocytes (atresia) during the spawning season.

J	Pinto-Coelho, RM; Greco, MKB				Pinto-Coelho, RM; Greco, MKB			The contribution of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and zooplankton to the internal cycling of phosphorus in the eutrophic Pampulha Reservoir, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The contribution of zooplankton and the water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, to the internal cycling of phosphorus was investigated in Pampulha Reservoir, in the shallow and eutrophic Pampulha Reservoir. In the last 20 years, algal blooms, as well as outbreaks of the macrophyte, have been observed with increasing frequency. Previous investigations have suggested that phosphorus is the limiting nutrient controlling the plant production in this ecosystem. A restoration program is currently underway aiming at the complete removal of external nutrient input. Therefore, the knowledge of the magnitude of some internal metabolic processes would be desirable in order to estimate the time lag that would be necessary for the recovery of water quality. The production and loss of macrophyte biomass was monitored in limnocurrals between May 1994 and April 1995. The zooplankton was also monitored during this period at a central sampling point. The biomass losses of macrophytes were followed in marked plants during their growing season. The P-content of macrophyte biomass was also measured monthly. Excretion rates of zooplankton collected in the reservoir were determined using short time experiments at the laboratory. This study demonstrated that zooplankton was more important for the P-cycling during the dry season when it was able to recycle a maximum of 26% d(-1) of total phosphorus in lake water. The macrophyte contribution was more important during the rainy season (especially at the end of the rainy season). In April 1995, the macrophytes were able to recycle as much as 26% d(-1) of the total phosphorus present in the water. At this time of the year, both communities recycled more than 40% d(-1) of the total phosphorus available in water. Therefore, it was demonstrated that zooplankton and macrophytes play a key role in the internal cycling of a limiting nutrient in this reservoir.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	411						115	127		10.1023/A:1003845516746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003845516746													WOS:000084893200013
J	Nakano, S; Koitabashi, T; Ueda, T				Nakano, S; Koitabashi, T; Ueda, T			Seasonal changes in abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and their consumption of bacteria in Lake Biwa with special reference to trophic interactions with Daphnia galeata	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We followed seasonal changes in the abundance of bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), rotifers and crustaceans, and the consumption of bacteria by HNF in mesotrophic Lake Biwa from March to November 1993. From March to July, the changing pattern of HNF densities was similar to that of bacteria, and HNF specific ingestion rate (bacteria flagellate(-1)h(-1)) increased. These results suggest that the food linkage between bacteria and HNF was substantial during that period. In August, both the density and specific ingestion rate of HNF dramatically decreased concomitantly with dominance of Daphnia galeata. Thus, there were two clear seasons of bacterial consumption: one dominated by HNF and the other by D. galeata. A significant negative correlation between densities of HNF and D. galeata (r = -0.773, p < 0.05) was found by Spearman rank correlation analysis over the study period, suggesting additional grazing by this zooplankter on HNF. Densities of rotifers and other crustaceans did not significantly correlate with those of HNF.																			0003-9136					APR	1998	142	1					21	34																WOS:000073820700002

Sediments showed the highest concentrations of the measured elements, followed by zooplankton, fish GCs and livers, while the lowest levels were present in fish muscles. Correspondence analysis revealed that the elemental composition of the fish GCs was mostly similar to that of the sediment and zooplankton. The element concentrations of carp liver and muscles were more similar to each other. Overall, the results indicate that fish liver was the main target organ accumulating Cu, Se and Zn, regardless of their initial amounts in the environment. A seasonal decrease of a range of elements in fish liver (Al, Co, Fe, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb and Sr) was evident towards the end of the investigation period. In addition, the fish DM showed a seasonal accumulation of Sr and Li. However, toxic elements i.e. As, B, Ba Hg and V did not show such a seasonal variation, and were evenly distributed between fish liver and muscles. The concentrations of some elements, such as As, in fish tissues were similar or even higher than in literature data from polluted sites, but none of them exceeded the maximum acceptable concentrations prescribed by Serbian legislation or by FAO or EU regulation.					; Stankovic, Marko/MAI-1301-2025; Zivic, Ivana/MFH-9267-2025; Manojlovic, Dragan/Q-4027-2016; Živić, Miroslav/GMW-7405-2022	Dulic, Zorka/0000-0003-4463-768X; Pergal, Marija/0000-0001-6078-2006; Markovic, Zoran/0000-0003-3703-9921; Stankovic, Marko/0000-0002-0555-5297; Zivic, Ivana/0000-0002-4397-9904; Zivic, Miroslav/0000-0002-0314-5032; Manojlovic, Dragan/0000-0003-1388-6245; 													0003-4088	2100-000X				FEB 13	2018	54								4	10.1051/limn/2017036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2017036													WOS:000426104300001

Monthly variation of fertility and oestrus frequency in crossbred dual-purpose cows in three agroecological areas of the South American tropics	TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION												The aim of this study was to examine the monthly variation of the first service conception (FSC) and oestrus frequency (OF) from 8308 artificial inserninations (AI) of 2960 crossbred dual-purpose cows on three commercial farms with improved management located in the Maracaibo Lake Basin, Venezuela. The effects of month of the year, agroecological area (from dry tropical forest to sub-humid tropical forest on the three farms), predominant breed (BT, Bos taurus; BI, Bos indicus), and season (December-April; May-August; and September-November) were considered. Data were analysed using logistic regression (FSC) and GLM (OF) from SAS. The mean FSC was 55.4% overall and 48.7%, 57.0% and 58.3% for farms A, B and C, respectively (p < 0.01). Within the three agroecological areas (farms A, B and C), the FSC was highest during the cooler and drier months of the year (season 1), while the lowest FSC was obtained during the months of highest rainfall and humidity (season 3) (53.3% vs 37.4%; 58.5% vs 49.0% and 63.0% vs 52.3% on farms A, B, C, respectively; p < 0.01). In the three studied farms, OF was higher during the first 4 months of the year; with a diminishing trend towards the end of the year (p < 0.05). In general, BI cows had a higher FSC than BT cows, especially during the second half of the year, when environmental conditions were characterized by higher rainfall and humidity with lower wind velocity (58.8%(a), 55.5 %(b) and 46.4%(c) in season 1, 2 and 3 respectively; (a,b,c) p < 0.01).					; Perea, Fernando/AFM-8711-2022	Perea, Fernando P./0000-0001-8301-6339; 													0049-4747	1573-7438				MAY	2006	38	4					353	363		10.1007/s11250-006-4316-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-006-4316-5								17137137					WOS:000240199400010

A total of 5 species of helminth parasites were found on 29 of 77 fish examined. The following parasites were found: Dactylogyrus folkmanovae, D. vistulae, Paradiplozoon megan, in gills of host fish, and Bothriocephalus acheilognathi, Rhabdochona denudata in intestine of host fish. Dactylogyrus folkmanovae was the dominant parasite species found in chub. The infection was the highest in May during the years of the study. The second dominant parasite, D. vistulae was also the highest in May. The third dominant parasite Rhabdochona denudata was highest during June and November.

J	Beaver, JR; Miller-Lemke, AM; Acton, JK				Beaver, JR; Miller-Lemke, AM; Acton, JK			Midsummer zooplankton assemblages in four types of wetlands in the Upper Midwest, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The objective of this study was to characterize the zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages of four different types of wetlands and to evaluate their use as environmental indicators. Total abundances, community composition, and species diversity were evaluated for zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages from 24 wetlands and related to water quality variables. During August 1995, six representative sites were sampled from four types of wetlands designated as constructed, impacted, non-impacted, or temporary. The plankton assemblages of all wetlands were dominated by cosmopolitan crustacean, rotifer, and phytoplankton taxa typical of lake plankton communities. Species diversity, richness, and evenness of zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages did not differ significantly among the wetland types. Total zooplankton abundance was significantly (p < 0.01) related to chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations over the range of trophic conditions. Mean zooplankton densities and phytoplankton biovolumes were similar among the wetlands, however, the relative abundances of major zooplankton groups differed among the wetland types. Cyanophytes, primarily Oscillatoria spp., were a major component of the phytoplankton across all four wetland types, and were significantly more abundant within the constructed and temporary sites. On average, rotifers accounted for 79% of total zooplankton abundance within the constructed wetlands and were much less dominant in the non-impacted and temporary wetlands. Cladoceran, copepodite, and adult copepod concentrations were low in the constructed and impacted wetlands and increased in the non-impacted and temporary wetlands in conjunction with increased chlorophytes and cryptophytes. Our preliminary survey suggests that abiotic factors which are known to directly affect phytoplankton may indirectly affect zooplankton composition in such a way as to use zooplankton assemblages as indicators of water quality. However, further study incorporating seasonal dynamics and the influence of predators on zooplankton assemblages is needed to fully assess the use of zooplankton community composition as an environmental indicator for wetland systems.																			0018-8158						1998	380						209	220		10.1023/A:1003452118351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003452118351													WOS:000078946700019

This paper describes the effects of differences in food quantity and quality on selected life history traits of Ceriodaphnia pulchella. Animals were fed with four concentrations of two green algae, Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlamydomonas globosa, given separately as well as in a 1:1 mixture. 2. In most cases growth, reproduction and condition of the animals and consequently the rate of population increase, r, increased with food concentration. Life history parameters of animals raised on S. obliquus were lowest, whereas no significant differences were found between animals fed with C. globosa and with the mixture of the two algal species. 3. In contrast to the large effects of food quantity and quality found in the laboratory, an analysis of the population dynamics of C. pulchella in Lake Tjeukemeer showed that the effect of changes in food conditions during the growing, season of this species was limited, although overall food levels seemed to be poor throughout the year. 4. Changes in the birth rate of the population are mainly governed by changes in temperature, and possibly by changes in the densities of the invertebrate predator Leptodora kindtii.

J	Aula, I; Braunschweiler, H; Malin, I				Aula, I; Braunschweiler, H; Malin, I			The watershed flux of mercury examined with indicators in the Tucurui reservoir in Para, Brazil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The concentrations of total mercury (Hg) in soils, sediments, sedimentable material and floating plants were studied in order to find out seasonal and areal variations in the flux of mercury in the man-made Tucurui reservoir in Para, northeastern Brazilian Amazon. The rise in Hg concentrations with increasing depth of the soil indicates no elevation in Hg deposition due to the atmospheric Hg emissions from gold mining. Hg content in sediments is dependent mainly on the content of organic matter and is highest on the outskirts of the reservoir. The flux of Hg increased more than fivefold from the dry to the rainy season in the former river Tocantins channel. The concentrations of Hg in floating plants were higher in the roots and submerged leaves than in the shoots and floating leaves. Seasonal variations in Hg levels could be explained by competition with nutrients or growth dilution effects. Properties of the soil, the vegetation type and the natural fluctuation of water might affect the concentration of Hg in the floating plants. Gold mining areas situated in the region of the reservoir are polluting the reservoir mainly via the Tocantins river. Hg is continuously accumulating in the reservoir at the rate of 235 kg year(-1) in suspended solids of the Tocantins river, with great seasonal variation.																			0048-9697					DEC 11	1995	175	2					97	107		10.1016/0048-9697(95)04906-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(95)04906-1													WOS:A1995TP00800002

Flies were caught in biconical traps and were intercepted with electric nets while in flight near traps. Carbon dioxide dispensed at a high rate (5 1 min(-1)) in linear forest failed to increase the numbers of tsetse attracted to or caught in traps. In contrast, catches of non-biting Muscidae, Stomoxyinae and Tabanidae were improved by up to 11 times. Inside dense forest, carbon dioxide released at half this rate increased both the numbers of female tsetse attracted to a trap and the catches in a trap by about 2-3 times. Catches of male tsetse were, however, not affected. Striking improvements for other Diptera were also realized (up to 102 times). Under a variety of conditions, unbaited biconical traps attracted many Diptera to the vicinity of a trap, but caught few flies due to low capture efficiencies (typically less than 10%). In contrast, efficiency estimates for G. f. fuscipes were good, varying from 37 to 82% in different habitats and seasons. These results are discussed in relation to the search for practical odour attractants for riverine tsetse.

Radiometric spectral profiles of the incident sunlight demonstrate different attenuation coefficients in the mixolimnion and in the chemocline not only for the visible light effective at each depth (photosynthetically available radiation), but also for selected photosynthetically active wavelengths used by oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs. Phototrophic bacteria sampled from the upper part of the layer at the maximum of cell concentration were incubated in transparent bottles at the sampling depth and at a lower depth where the light intensity is only a few percent of the one at the sampling depth. Within 4 h the specific bacteriochlorophyll concentration (Bchl protein(-1)) increased up to 50% depending on the difference in Light intensity between the sampling and the incubation depth. The specific bacteriochlorophyll concentration in the upper part of the layer remained constant (53.0 mg Bchl g(-1) protein, S.D. = 4.8) in spite of large changes in cell concentrations in the lake water over the season. These observations illustrate the phenomenon of light-regulated pigment synthesis under natural conditions.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				SEP	1996	21	1					1	9																WOS:A1996VG26100001

Comparison of the diet between sampling sites (upper course, lower course and man-made Lake Ayame) shows significant differences. In the man-made lake, prey described as preferential include Asterionella (Bacillariophyceae) and Bosmina (Cladocera). In the lower course, the preferential preys are represented by Lyngbya (Cyanophyceae) while in the upper course Lyngbya and chironomid larvae are preferential. These differences are related to the altered environmental conditions generated by the construction of the dam on the Bia river main stream.

This species has a single chloroplast in both views of the valve, apical pore fields composed of three slits, and uniseriate striae. It is planktonic and was found in brackish water. Synedropsis roundii is the eighth Synedropsis species to be described and the first to be found in a tropical region. We studied the seasonal dynamics of S. roundii, which can form blooms in the coastal Imboassica Lagoon, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Continuous mixing of this shallow environment is suggested to be an important physical factor determining the success of the species. Availability of soluble reactive silicon is thought to be the main factor regulating the large biomass fluctuations. In the classification of Reynolds in 1997 (Vegetation processes in the pelagic: a model for ecosystem theory. Ecology Institute, Oldendorf, Germany, 371 pp.), S. roundii appears to belong to D-assemblage, a set of small and fast-growing diatoms, well represented in small, shallow and enriched waters.

Comparisons between the MFR/FPI in seasonal wind climatologies (at a radar height of 98 km) and wind speed ratios and direction-difference histograms for the Saskatoon systems show excellent agreement. Zonal and meridional wind comparisons (scatter plots) also show no significant differences in mean winds between the FPI and MFR. Differences between instantaneous measurements, as Seen on 91 individual days, are categorized into four types of events, depending upon FPI/MFR similarities and differences and the dominance of the solar tide. A gravity wave model is then used to demonstrate the effects of waves, with scales from hundreds to several thousand of kilometers, upon such optical and radar systems, each of which has a different inherent spatial averaging. The model is largely successful in explaining the differences between the instantaneous MFR and FPI measurements. The relevance of such comparisons to satellite/ground-based collaborations is briefly discussed.																			2169-897X					DEC 27	1996	101	D23					29553	29563		10.1029/96JD01915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96JD01915													WOS:A1996WA69300013

Seasonal variability was evident in all algal components. The water column accounted for the majority of chlorophyll-a (>90%) in December, March, and September, but accounted for only 61.1% of total chlorophyll-a in June. Conservative estimates of total chlorophyll-a biomass ranged from 1300 to 36,600kg for attached algae, and from 41,770 to 206,600kg for phytoplankton. Overall, the greatest epipelon biomass was measured in June, the greatest epiphyton biomass was measured in March, and the greatest phytoplankton biomass was measured in December in the pelagic region and in June in the littoral region. Stations deep within the littoral zone had greater epipelic and epiphytic biomass than those located along the fringe zone between the pelagic and littoral zones. Principal components analyses revealed that stations located within the marsh formed the most distinct groupings. Light-related factors were important in separating stations along axis I, whereas water chemistry helped separate stations along axis 2. Overall, these results suggest that epipelon, epiphyton, and phytoplankton communities are responding differently to the forcing functions in this large, subtropical lake. Management decisions influencing lake lever may affect these communities differentially, which in turn, may influence ecosystem processes.

While some populations are native, many fisheries are the result of introductions through stocking programs. These stockings can result in established fisheries while others fail to produce established populations. It is possible that a combination of physical, chemical, and biological variables produce an ideal environment for the successful establishment and survival of this species. The objective of this study was to identify the key factors that influence the success of blue catfish populations in Texas reservoirs. Thirty reservoirs distributed across Texas were sampled using gill nets and low-frequency electrofishing. Blue catfish abundance, condition, and natural reproduction were compared with multiple physicochemical and biological variables collected at each reservoir. Factor analysis indicated that both gill-net catch rates and low-frequency electrofishing catch rates were positively correlated to measures of primary productivity. The analysis also showed that gill-net catch rates increased with increasing reservoir surface area. The occurrence of natural reproduction showed a weak negative correlation to length of growing season. The results of this study provide further insight into the biology of blue catfish and provide managers with information that can be used to prioritize future stocking efforts.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-25-7				2011	77						187	197																WOS:000393725100016

Evidence supporting the importance of nutrient regeneration by nano- and micrograzers for phytoplankton photosynthesis in Lake Malawi/Nyasa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Photosynthesis and nutrient status measurements were compared in size fractioned water samples collected in southern Lake Malawi in three different seasons. The size fractions analyzed were 0-2.0 mu m, 0-20 mu m, and 0-200 mu m. Total chlorophyll concentrations were relatively invariant at about 1 mu g L(-1) in all seasons (wet stratified, deep mixing, dry stratified). Over 90% of total chlorophyll was < 20 mu m and 40-50% < 2 mu m. Stoichiometric ratios of carbon (C):nitrogen (N) and C:phosphorus (P) for the < 2-mu m seston were similar to < 20-mu m and < 200-mu m seston samples and indicated that all size fractions were moderately N and P deficient in all seasons. N and P uptake experiments demonstrated that when the < 2-mu m picoplankton were isolated from the larger sizes, they showed high N and P nutrient debts, apparently in response to the removal of nano- and micrograzers. This effect was strongest for N debt in the dry stratified season, but was apparent for P debt in all seasons. The chlorophyll-normalized light saturated rate of photosynthesis, P(m)(b), was always higher in whole water samples compared to the rates of the isolated picophytoplankton which were lowest in the dry season. We infer that nano- and micrograzers were an especially important source of regenerated nutrients when the lake was stratified although their removal as a source of nutrient to the picophytoplankton may affect P(m)(b) in all seasons. Nitrogen regeneration was especially critical to the picophytoplankton in the dry stratified season but less important in the windy deep mixing season.

Implications of Climate Change on Water Security in the Mediterranean Region	CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECTS ON WATER RESOURCES: ISSUES OF NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SECURITY	NATO Science for Peace and Security Series C-Environmental Security				NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Effect of Climate Change on Water Resources - Issues of National and Global Security	SEP 01-04, 2010	Izmir, TURKEY					Throughout the Mediterranean Region, a combination of population growth and climate change will compromise our ability to manage available water resources. Pro-active resource management decisions are required; however, these efforts will prove futile unless reliable predictions can be made of the impact that changing conditions will impart upon the hydrologic cycle and water reserves. Groundwater is a particular concern as its unique characteristics are rarely adequately accommodated within IWRM (Integrated Water Resource Management). Moreover, few studies have considered the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in a region where meteorological conditions and sea and lake levels are expected to change at rates that are unprecedented in modern times. Time is of the essence. Groundwater is resilient to drought and promises to play a crucial role in regions where climate change threatens renewable water resources. Questions that need to be addressed are: (1) How will climate change affect the nature and seasonality of aquifer recharge? (2) How will fresh groundwater levels beneath coastal areas respond to changing sea/lake levels, and to what extent will rising sea levels promote the intrusion of seawater? (3) Will a decline in sea/lake levels accelerate the release of contaminants stored in coastal aquifers to receiving water bodies? (4) Over what time frame will changes to the groundwater system occur?																			1871-4668		978-94-007-1142-6				2011							9	16		10.1007/978-94-007-1143-3_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1143-3_2													WOS:000297619100002

Gonads tissue changes of Chalcalburnus mossulensis(Heckel, 1843) infected by Ligula intestinalis (cestoda)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Chalcalburnus mossulensis from the cyprinidae family is one of the indigenous fish in Gheshlagh Lake of Kordestan, Iran. Ligula intestinalis is one of the infective parasites among various species of fish and causes gonads atrophy. In this study, after detection of species and age of samples, the effects of this parasite on gonads tissues and sexual maturation of Chalcalburnus mossulensis were investigated. By seasonal sampling 144 samples were collected. After investigatiing gonad tissue samples, it was clear that, there is a significant difference between the means of male and female gonads maturation rate in infected and non infected samples (p<0.05). Infection by Ligula intestinalis can be the reason for lack of gonads maturation. In addition, the abnormal degenerative changes like, absorption follicle, hemorrhage and infiltration of inflammation cells in ovary tissues of infected fish were seen. In testicle tissue, dispersed hemorrhage, atrophy and MMC (melano-macrophage center) were seen as pathological signs. So the spread of this parasite in different water sources is important as the point the maintenance of native species and cultivated fish.					; Sharifpour, Issa/K-4162-2017; Amiri, Bagher/AAP-3899-2021; Jamili, Shahla/S-1646-2016	Sharifpour, Issa/0000-0003-1878-6788; Jamili, Shahla/0000-0001-9939-8677													1562-2916					JAN	2011	10	1					85	94																WOS:000287323600008

Materials and methods. A gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer XL Autosystem) with electron capture detector and capillary column 5% diphenyl and 95% dimethylpolysiloxane, with 30 m in length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 mm thick film were used. Two species were studied: Prochilodus magdalenae and Hoplias malabaricus during wet and dry seasons. Results. The percentages of pesticides recovered were 80 and 84% whereas the detection and quantification limit was 0.02 to 0.18 ng/g and 0.2 to 1.8 ng/g for both species, respectively. Relative standar deviation remained below 7% in all cases. Among those organochlorinated investigated here, alpha-clordane, endrin and aldrin were detected in both fish species. In one of the species studies, it was observed that when weight and size of fishes incresed the pesticides concentration also increased. The concentration levels of OCPs were in the range of 0.35-3.75 and 0.48-5.49 ng/g for moncholo (Hoplias malabaricus) and bocachico (Prochilodus magdalenae) respectively. Conclusions. The frequency of OCPs and the levels detected in these species might be the result of anthropogenic activities conducted in the vicinity of the lake. The correlation between the biometric measurements and concentration was depending on the fish species. The concentrations found in the studied species Hoplias malabaricus and Prochilodus magdalenae do not represent an immediately lethal toxicity.																			0122-0268					JAN-APR	2011	16	1					2402	2409																WOS:000294442800016

The conducted studies indicated that anthropogenic saline reservoirs are typified by specific limnic processes. It concern especially myctic processes, which are distinctly different from those known from fresh water lakes. The "Brzeszcze" reservoir is of bradymictic type, characterized by advantage of stagnation over mixing. Differences in conductivity between bottom and surface waters within 3 meters varied from 5.4 mS . cm(-1) to 11.8 mS . cm(-1). The waters were also characterized by large decrease in oxygenation with depth and between seasons from more than 22 to ca 1 mg O-2/dm(3). The hydrological situation in "Brzeszcze" is to the some extent similar an estuary. The movement of waters is determined by the process called "anthropomixing". Another unusual feature was high short-term changes within 5 minutes in conductivity and turbidity probably associated with waving caused by wind.

In November 2010, this red swamp crayfish was detected in Lake Orta, a large, deep, Italian subalpine lake. Well-known for its 80-year heavy pollution by copper, Lake Orta has been gradually colonized by biota, after its chemical recovery in the 1980s. The lake is still far from being comparable to other subalpine lakes for taxa composition and seasonal dynamics. Lake Orta may be regarded as an unstable environment, in which the invasion by this voracious species deserves particular attention. After the present early detection, we plan to perform interventions to minimize negative impacts of P. clarkii to both the ecology and economy of the region. The latter may be particularly important in the case of the Lake Orta because of a persistence of heavy metals in the sediments.

Length-weight relationship and biological data of a threatened fish, Ptychobarbus chungtienensis (Tsao, 1964) in Bita Lake of Shangri-La, Yunnan, China	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												This paper provides the length-weight relationship (LWR) and other biological information of a threatened plateau freshwater fish species Ptychobarbus chungtienensis in the subfamily Schizothoracinae of the family Cyprinidae, from the Bita Lake of Shangri-la, in Yunnan, China. The LWR was BW = 0.00954 TL2.95 for a total of 392 individuals, where the coefficient b was close to 3.0, suggesting a near-isometric growth in this species. The total length: standard length relationship was TL = 0.399 + 1.151 SL. Fitting a von Bertalanffy growth function to the observed leng-that-age data resulted in L-(t) = 53.1 (1-e (0.08)((t) (0.2))). The natural mortality rate (M) was 0.20 year(-1). Length at first maturity (Lm) was 20.57 cm, and 6.3 years the theoretical estimated age at first maturity (Am). Ptychobarbus chungtienensis mature gradually beginning in May, reaching a reproduction peak around August, with most individuals completing reproduction by October. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) was highest in August (GSI = 0.1351) and lowest in October (GSI = 0.0467). The male index (GSI = 0.0866) was lower than in females (GSI = 0.1466) (P < 0.05). Mean condition factor (Km) of P. chungtienensis was 0.8500, and not significantly different between sexes (P = 0.124), but differing significantly between seasons. In October the condition factor (Km = 0.9211) was significantly higher than in May (Km = 0.8379) or in August (Km = 0.8412) (P < 0.05).					; Jiang, Wansheng/AFU-4407-2022	Jiang, Wansheng/0000-0002-6498-944X; 													0175-8659					OCT	2013	29	5					1173	1176		10.1111/jai.12143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12143													WOS:000324067600041

Microcystine-RR and -LR were the main components of the toxins contained in bloom samples of Microcystis and a very little quantity of -YR was detected through this period. The high amounts of microcystins were estimated during the exponential growth phase of the bloom from June 11 to July 20. The highest concentrations of microcystins-RR and -LR were estimated as 121 and 81.6 mu g/100 mg cells on July 20, 1991, respectively. While the higher amounts of the toxins were estimated when M. aeruginosa predominated, the lower amounts were estimated during the predominate period of M. viridis. Since the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration may well affect the dominance of M. aeruginosa and M. viridis; the production of the toxins by Microcystis may be associated with the DIN concentration.

A recent tube sampling and core drilling programme has revealed an infilling consisting of some 90 m of fine lacustrine sediments (chiefly organic muds, underlain below 30 m depth by micrites) which rest upon a further 61 m of coarse clastic debris. Granite bedrock was encountered at -151 m. Broad sedimentary zones correspond with major phases in the evolution of the crater lake. Superimposed cyclical patterns of accumulation reflect environmental changes on millenial to seasonal timescales. C-14 age determinations on algal debris from the upper 20 m of the core indicate a mean rate of sedimentation of about 1 m/2000 yr, suggesting that the lacustrine sequence may span almost 200,000 yr. Over this period major environmental changes are apparent from sedimentological, chemical, mineralogical and isotopic analyses of the core and studies of the pollen spectra and diatom assemblages present within it. This long continental sequence is therefore providing a high-resolution palaeoenvironmental record for southern mid-latitudes over much the same period as is covered by the Vostok ice-core in Antarctica.

J	HEUSSER, CJ				HEUSSER, CJ			ICE-AGE VEGETATION AND CLIMATE OF SUBTROPICAL CHILE	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Vegetation and climate of subtropical Chile over the past > 50,000 yr are reconstructed from pollen, spores, and other microfossils contained in a 10.7-m section of lacustrine deposits of Laguna de Tagua Tagua (34.degree.30''S, 71.degree.10''W). Controlled by 14 radiocarbon age determinations, five pollen assemblages covering stratigraphic zones in the section represent plants on the upland and species inhabiting the lake basin. Surface pollen spectra from 58 stations (approximately 30-40.degree.S) form an adjunct for interpreting past vegetation and climate from the fossil record. Temperate, semi-humid woodland of southern beech (Nothofagus dombeyi type) and podocarp (Prumnopitys andina) was apparently established about Laguna de Tagua Tagua during the Pleistocene. Contrasting existing semi-arid, broad sclerophyllous vegetation, the woodland was extensive about the lake at the time of the last glacial maximum (25,000-14,000 yr B.P.) and earlier (>43,000-34,000 yr B.P.). Pollen from the families Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae, which characterize intervals of the Pleistocene (centered around 33,000 and >43,000 yr B.P.) and the Holocene, suggests intervening episodes of relative aridity. Lake level fluctuations appear to follow the late Quaternary climatic pattern implied by pollen assemblage data. Water in the lake was relatively high during development of southern beech-podocarp woodland, whereas during intervals of chenopod-amaranth dominance, lake levels were comparatively low. Excess precipitation over evaporation, which during the Pleistocene favored development of woodland of beech and podocarp, is attributed to greater storm frequency. Conditions were apparently governed by strengthening of atmospheric circulation in the belt of southern westerly winds. In the late-glacial, the temperate and more humid, ice age climate with limited seasonality underwent transition to a subtropical, semi-arid, Mediterranean type that identifies the postglacial. Fluctuations in intensity of the southern westerlies, marked by latitudinal movement of the polar front, can account for past vegetation changes at Laguna de Tagua Tagua.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT	1990	80	2					107	127		10.1016/0031-0182(90)90124-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(90)90124-P													WOS:A1990EJ26800002

Simultaneous enrichment with DNA and BSA strongly increased the abundance and biomass of all studied groups of microorganisms and induced changes in their morphological and taxonomic structure. The increased participation of large heterotrophic nanoflagellates cells (larger than 10 mu m) in their total numbers and shifts in taxonomic and trophic structure of the ciliates, from algivorous to small bacterivorous, species were observed. Grazing caused changes in bacterial size distribution in all enriched mesocosms. Large (10-50 mu m) filamentous bacteria significantly contributed to the total bacterial numbers and biomass. Pronounced increase in populations of beta- and gamma-Protcobacteria was found in lake water enriched with organic P and N sources, whereas alpha-Proteobacteria did not change markedly in the studied mesocosms. DNA additions stimulated the rates of bacterial secondary production. BSA shortened the rates of bacterial biomass turnover in lake water. Relatively high and constant (similar to 30%) percentage contribution of active bacteria (MEM+) in two mesocosms enriched with DNA and DNA+BSA suggested the important role of nucleic acids as a source of phosphorus for bacterial growth, activity and production. Numerous and statistically significant correlations between bacteria and protists indicated the direct and selective predator-prey relationship.

Phytoplankton dynamics in a chain of subtropical blackwater lakes: the Upper St. Johns River, Florida, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Spatial and seasonal patterns in phytoplankton biovolume and community composition were examined for a chain of lakes in the Upper St. Johns River (USJR), Florida, USA. There was a general downstream trend in both increasing phytoplankton biovolume, and dominance of the algal community by cyanobacteria. Total algal biovolume increased from 0.7 x 10(6) mu m(3)/ml in the headwaters lake to 5.6 x 10(6) mu m(3)/ml downstream in Lake Winder. Cyanobacteria dominated the downstream lakes, accounting for approximately 50% of total algal biovolume, yet constituted only 2% of total biovolume in the headwaters lake. The diatom assemblage, as well as water quality data, suggests that these blackwater lakes are mesotrophic to eutrophic and neither nitrogen nor phosphorus limited growth. Fifteen months of cyanobacterial biovolume data were compared to water quality data to determine principal regulating factors. A regression model indicates that the major factors correlated with cyanobacteria in these lakes are temperature, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, water level, and color, with temperature alone accounting for 54% of the variability in cyanobacterial biovolume. This analysis demonstrates that multiple interacting factors need to be considered when attempting to explain spatiotemporal patterns in algal dynamics.

LIMNOLOGY AND TROPHIC STATUS OF SHAHPUR DAM RESERVOIR, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Phytoplankton, because of their role as primary producers in an aquatic ecosystem are the subject of great interest and their qualitative and quantitative estimates can provide good indices of quality and productive capacity of water. Present studies were carried out to determine the seasonal phytoplankton composition and reservoir productivity of Shahpur Dam in Pakistan. Carlson Trophic Index was determined to analyze trophic status of reservoir. A total of 35 genera, belonging to 28 families and 7 classes were identified during the study. Class Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria were found to be most diverse and dominant. It was observed that Morpho-edaphic Index on TDS and Secchi depth were significantly correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration. Chlorophyll-a probably would be better indicator of trophic state of reservoir and in absence of chlorophyll-a data, MEI could be used as practical potential tool for fisheries management.																			1018-7081	2309-8694					2009	19	4					217	223																WOS:000273927300012

Nile perch from Lake Victoria had higher material yield and omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) but lower content of vitamin A than those from Lake Albert. Levels of omega-3 FAs (4.36-20.20%) and vitamin A (2.83-7.88 mg/100 g of oil) were generally high. Levels of lead and cadmium showed significant variation with site. Material weight and vitamin A contents were higher, whereas FAs were lower in fish captured during the dry season than those in the wet season.					; Muyonga, John/AGP-4942-2022	Muyonga, John/0000-0002-5598-1462; Ogwok, Patrick/0000-0001-7312-3333													1049-8850	1547-0636					2009	18	4					331	344		10.1080/10498850903224224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850903224224													WOS:000271021600005

Limnological changes in a pond ecosystem caused by grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Val.) low stocking density	CZECH JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Val.) stocked (29 kg/ha) in a small pond reduced the biomass of aquatic macrophytes from 109 g/m(2) to 33 g/m(2) during one growing season. The only changes in hydrochemical parameters (pH, alkalinity, acidity, BOD5, CODMn, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, TN, PO4-P and TP) associated with the grass carp stocking were a decrease in pH (from 8.43 to 7.57) and in NO3-N concentration (from 0.99 mg/l to 0.56 mg/l). The increases in organic matter content and NO3-N concentration in the surface sediment layer were higher in the control pond than in the pond stocked with grass carp. No changes were detected in the other parameters (NH4-N, PO4-P and TP) in the upper sediment layer and between all parameters measured in the lower inorganic layer. The grass carp grazing had no impact on phytoplankton biomass (concentration of chlorophyll-a) or species composition. There were no changes either in the abundance or in the species composition of zooplankton and zoobenthos induced by grass carp. Statistically significant indirect changes (in water and sediment chemistry) following the grass carp stocking were connected especially with a reduction in the biomass of the filamentous alga (Cladophora globulina) or rather with its maintenance in the control pond.

It also evaluated the relationships between calcium, mercury, and selenium in the mussel tissues. The mussel populations from the deep, meso-oligotrophic Lake Maggiore and the shallow, eutrophic Lake Concha were analzed. The mean concentration of mercuri; in the tissues vas 0.075 mg kg(-1) in Lake Maggiore mussels and 0.033 mg kg(-1) in Lake Candia mussels. The local mercury content in the mussel biomass per surface unit was about eleven- fold higher in Lake Maggiore (5.99 mu g Hg m(-2)) than in Lake Candia (0.55 mu g Hg m(-2)). This wide difference was due firstly to the larger polpulation density (46.86 vs 6.93 ind m(-2)) and secondly to the higher individual content (0.128 vs 0.079 mu g Hg ind(-1)) in Lake Maggiore than in Lake Candia. These differences in population density and individual mercury content are the result of both biological and environmental characteristics. Lake trophy and water renewal affect population density and individual growth rate, and ultimately determine their impact on biogeochemical cycles by regulating the mussel standing stock. The relationships between mercury, calcium and selenium were taken into account.

J	Sterner, RW				Sterner, RW			Demography of a natural population of Daphnia retrocurva in a lake with low food quality	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The hypothesis was tested that Daphnia exhibit low population recruitment in a lake with phosphorus (P)-deficient food, where Daphnia populations failed to increase in response to greatly lowered minnow density. Egg ratio analysis was performed on Daphnia retrocurva from L110 of the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario, in 1994. L110 has high food abundance (seston carbon (C) similar to 100 mu M C), but the seston is P deficient (C:P atomic similar to 600). Chrysophytes dominated the algal community. The fish community in this lake was manipulated in 1993 and 1994 by the addition of northern pike, Esox lucius. Zooplanktivorous minnows were greatly reduced after the piscivore addition, but the expected increase in abundance of the Daphnia to this altered predation regime was not observed. If food quality constrains the response of the Daphnia to changed predation, there should be low recruitment in the relatively sparse Daphnia population in this lake. Birth rates estimated by standard egg ratio analysis were <0.1 day(-1) for most of the sample period. In comparison to annual averages from the literature, recruitment in L110 was moderately, but not dramatically, low. Daphnia exhibited pronounced 'normal' vertical migration (up at night, down during the day) all year, and a strongly declining size at first reproduction through the season. Population density and birth rates seemed to show much less short-term change than previously observed in other lakes. Although the demographic predictions for food quality constraints seemed clear, in situ demography unfortunately neither supported nor strongly rejected the overall hypothesis of food quality limitation in this lake with very high C:P ratios. Possibly, direct demographic effects of low food quality will be difficult to observe in nature.

As for other continents, the Australian naidid fauna consists mostly of cosmopolitan species. although there are indications of greater endemicity than currently recognised. While some naidids are widespread in Australia, others have a northern or a southern bias to their distribution, but few have been recorded in Tasmania. Many new records and species of Phreodrilidae have been documented since the review by Pinder & Brinkhurst (1997a) and these have allowed notions of phreodrilid zoogeography to be refined. The family is still considered particularly diverse in some temperate areas (Tasmania and the far south-west of Western Australia), but surprisingly few species are known from the temperate south-east mainland. Increasingly, new phreodrilid species are being collected from seasonal habitats on granite outcrops in the south-west and from refugial habitats (caves, groundwater and permanent river pools) in drier regions. A complete picture of oligochaete distributions will require much more work and patterns suggested by current data are presented here as hypotheses.																			0018-8158					NOV 1	2001	463						49	64		10.1023/A:1013131019636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013131019636													WOS:000173381100009
J	SANDJENSEN, K; MADSEN, TV				SANDJENSEN, K; MADSEN, TV			MINIMUM LIGHT REQUIREMENTS OF SUBMERGED FRESH-WATER MACROPHYTES IN LABORATORY GROWTH EXPERIMENTS	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												(1) This study determined the minimum light requirements and the photo-adaptive behaviour of submerged freshwater macrophytes representing different taxonomic groups (charophytes, bryophytes and angiosperms), and their depth distributions in the field. Relative growth rates (mu) of macrophytes were measured in the laboratory at photon flux densities (PFD) between 0 and 105-mu-mol m-2 s-1 at 7-degrees-C. Dark respiration rates were measured subsequently on the adapted plants. (2) Mean rates of carbon loss were low in plants kept in the dark (5.9 mmol C mol-1 cell C day-1) and corresponded to experimental dark respiration rates. Mean dark respiration was only 7.0 mmol C mol-1 cell C day-1 at the light compensation point (I(c)), which was on average 6.9-mu-mol m-2 s-1. Light compensation points and respiration rates were variable within species collected at different times and approached the variability among species. The growth efficiency in low light (the slope of mu vs. PFD) varied less within species and showed differences among species which were positively related to the maximum growth rate at high light. Overall, macrophyte species with different depth distribution or taxonomy did not differ systematically in dark respiration and growth performance in low light in the experiments. (3) Experimental I(c) levels of the two charophyte species, converted to annual means (78-165 mol m-2 year-1), corresponded to annual PFD levels of 40-200 mol m-2 year-1 at the depth limit of charophyte species in the hypolimnion of oligotrophic temperate lakes. Experimental I(c) levels of normally rooted angiosperms were much lower than PFD levels at their depth limits in epilimnetic waters. However, these plants formed no roots at low light in the laboratory and needed c. 24-mu-mol m-2 s-1 for proper root development. Considering that this light level (505 mol m-2 year-1 or 7% of surface PFD) is needed for root development, correspondence with depth limits was much closer. These comparisons are complicated by daily and seasonal variability of light and temperature under field conditions. However, seasonal adaptations in the field, and the possible operation of loss processes (e.g. grazing and detachment), should cause greater light requirements for survival of field populations. (4) Comparisons between freshwater macrophytes and phytoplankton show larger chlorophyll:carbon and protein:carbon ratios of phytoplankters, which combined with their smaller size lead to higher growth-light efficiencies, higher respiration rates and overall lower I(c) levels.

J	Qu, WC; Morrison, RJ; West, RJ; Su, CW				Qu, WC; Morrison, RJ; West, RJ; Su, CW			Diagenetic stoichiometry and benthic nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface of Lake Illawarra, Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Benthic flux measurements of O-2, TCO2 and inorganic nutrients were made at three stations (seagrass beds, shallow bare sand and deep mud) in Lake Illawarra (Australia) to compare the characteristics of diagenesis and benthic biogeochemical processes for different primary producers (seagrass or microphytobenthos, (MPB)) and/or sediment types (sand or mud). Seagrass beds exhibited the highest gross primary productivity while the lowest rates occurred at the deep mud station. At the shallow bare sand station only, the gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) were balanced, while at the other two stations, R exceeded GPP by as much as 2 fold, indicating more organic carbon was decomposed than produced at the time of sampling. In general, nutrient fluxes displayed typical diurnal variation. Organic carbon oxidation scenarios, evaluated by either calcium carbonate dissolution or sulfate reduction models, indicated that both models can represent organic matter mineralization. The difference of estimated total carbon oxidized in this lake using the two models was small, ranging from 0.2% at deep mud station to maximum of 21% at seagrass station. In addition, N-2 flux rates (net denitrification), estimated using carbon and nitrogen stoichiometry, were of similar magnitude as the rates estimated using LOICZ budget modeling or measured using the N-2/Ar technique. Finally, a comparison of calculated diffusive fluxes and measured fluxes using incubation cores indicated that the results were of similar magnitude at the deep mud station, but the incubation cores fluxes were much higher than the calculated diffusive fluxes at the other two stations. This may have been caused by bioturbation or bioirrigation.

Rates were <30% of the estimate calculated from nitrogen mass balance of the lake. To investigate this discrepancy, in situ measurements were performed in flexible enclosures to which (NO3-)-N-15 was added. Accumulation of N-29(2) and N-30(2) in the sediment and water column was measured and the loss to the atmosphere was estimated from depletion of argon, added in excess to the water of the enclosures. The calculated denitrification activities in the enclosures were 6 to 26 times higher than the activity in the incubated cores. We suggest that denitrification in situ was enhanced by wave forces, increasing the transport of oxygen and nitrate into these soft sediments. Such transport is not simulated by conventional stirring of the water column in laboratory incubations, which consequently may underestimate the in situ activity.

J	Branstrator, DK				Branstrator, DK			Ecological interactions between bythotrephes cederstroemi and Leptodora kindtii and the implications for species replacement in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The zooplankton predator, Leptodora kindtii, declined in abundance at an offshore reference station in Lake Michigan in the mid-1980s following the invasion of another zooplankton predator, Bythotrephes cederstroemi. Both predators feed largely on daphnid prey and it was observed that densities of three Daphnia species declined in abundance at the reference station following the Bythotrephes invasion. Circumstantial evidence would suggest that the native predator, Leptodora, was competitively suppressed by Bythotrephes. However, results of laboratory experiments presented here show that Bythotrephes will readily attack and eat Leptodora when the predators are maintained under concentrated densities, even if alternative prey are available for the Bythotrephes. There was no evidence in these experiments that Leptodora attacked or ate Bythotrephes. These results imply that predation by Bythotrephes on Leptodora may alternatively account for the collapse of Leptodora in offshore Lake Michigan. In this note I discuss evidence in support of competition and predation as alternative hypotheses to explain the pattern of species replacement, Bythotrephes for Leptodora, observed in Lake Michigan. The existing data are not definitive and tempt further inquiry.																			0380-1330						1995	21	4					670	679		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71077-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71077-2													WOS:A1995TP51700024

These results allowed us to estimate the aggregate clearance rates of Lampsilis and total unionids in the lake. Retention efficiency for seston in the 0.79-1.00 mu m ESD size category was 0.44 whereas 0.07 was the corresponding value for 0.91-mu m microspheres in laboratory prepared mixtures of microspheres and cultured algae; respective values for the 0.63-0.79 mu m size category were not significantly different from zero. Particle shape may explain the difference between natural seston and microspheres. Particles in the picoplankton size range (<3 mu m ESD) were probably an important food resource to the mussels, since 35-49% of the seston volume in Lake St. Clair was smaller than 3 mu m ESD. Regression analyses of filtration rate as a function of temperature and food concentration showed that feeding rate was temperature driven and not saturated by available seston concentration. Lampsilis and total community clearance rates were maximum in September, with respective fractions of the water columns swept clear of 0.018 and 0.053 . d(-1).

The objective of this study is to analyze sedimentary dynamics and its influence on the changing ecosystem of Aheme lake from 1961-2010. Data used to carry out the study are records of precipitation, flows, turbidity, suspended sediment, mineral elements and bathymetry. Grain size data from the sieving of sediment samples were used to interpret suspended solids distribution in the lake. Linear correlation coefficients were used to assess the degree of dependence between rainfall and runoff inputs to the lake. Lake depth measurements in some areas of the lake serve to determine the rate of infilling. The sorting index was used to highlight the distribution and origin of sediments in the lake. The results show a degradation of the lake Aheme ecosystem characterized by infilling of its bed, a high correlation (r = 0.90) between rainfall and runoff, seasonal change in physicochemical parameters (total suspended sediment decrease by 91 %) and decrease in fish production by 135.8 t yr(-1). The highest mean suspended sediment concentrations in lake inputs occur during high water periods (123 mgL(-1)) compared to low water periods (11.2 mgL(-1)).

This societal decay has been linked to a drying of the climate at the same time, when lakes in the Rajasthan area contracted and dried up, and discharge from the River Indus reduced. Although rivers may also have played a part in supplying water to the Harappan, attempts to reconstruct the Holocene drainage network show that most major reorganisation preceded human settlement by a significant amount of time. Any connection between the River Yamuna and the Indus basin was severed no later than 10,000 years ago. Instead, seasonal flooding by the River Ghaggar-Hakra, sourced in the Himalayan foothills, was key to successful agriculture during the Mature Harappan cultural phase, but declined as the monsoon rains weakened after 3000-2000 bc. Subsequently the Ghaggar-Hakra was overwhelmed by dunes in an expanding Thar Desert. Direct comparisons between the Ghaggar-Hakra and the mythical, glacier-fed River Saraswati are hard to support during the Bronze Age.

Estimating lake-water evaporation from data of large-aperture scintillometer in the Badain Jaran Desert, China, with two comparable methods	INNOVATIVE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT - UNDERSTANDING AND BALANCING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HUMANKIND AND NATURE	Proceedings of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS)				8th International Water Resources Management Conference of ICWRS	JUN 13-15, 2018	Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	ICWRS, Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing Key Lab Urban Hydrol Cycle & Sponge City Technol, Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, ICWRS	Beijing Normal Univ			Accurate quantification of evaporation (Eo) from open water is vital in arid regions for water resource management and planning, especially for lakes in the desert. The scintillometers are increasingly recognized by researchers for their ability to determine sensible (H) and latent heat fluxes (LE) accurately over distances of hundreds of meters to several kilometers, though scintillometers are mainly used to monitor the land surface processes. In this paper, it is installed on both sides of the shore over a lake. Compared to the data of evaporationpan, the scintillometer was successfully applied to Sumu Barun Jaran in Badain Jaran Desert using the classical method and the proposed linearized /3 method. Due to the difficulty in measuring water surface temperature and the easiness to monitor the water temperature at different depths, it is worth thinking that if is feasible to utilize the shallow water temperature instead of the water surface temperature and how much errors it will cause. Water temperature at 10 and 20 cm depths were used to replace the lakewater surface temperature in the two methods to analyze the changes of sensible and latent heat fluxes in hot and cold seasons at halfhour time scales. Based on the classical method, the values of H were almost barely affected, and the average value of LE using water temperature at 20 cm depth is 0.8-9.5 % smaller than that at 10 cm depth in cold seasons. In hot seasons, compared to the results at 10 cm depth, the average value of H increased by 20-30 %, and LE decreased by about 20 % at 20 cm depth. In the proposed linearized /3 method of scintillometer, only the slope of the saturation pressure curve (A) is related to the water surface temperature, which was estimated using available equations of saturated vapor pressure versus temperature of the air. Compared to the values of estimated by the air temperature, while the water surface temperature are replaced by water temperature at 10 and 20 cm depths, in different seasons, the errors of 2-25 % in A were caused. Thus was calculated by the original equation in the proposed linearized /3 method of scintillometer. Interestingly, the water temperature at 10 and 20 cm depths had little effect on H, LE (E0) in different seasons. The reason is that the drying power of the air (EA) accounted for about 85 % of the evaporation (i.e. the changes of A have only about 3 % impact on evaporation), which indicated that the driving force from unsaturated to saturated vapor pressure at 2 m height (i.e. the aerodynamic portion) has the main role on evaporation. Therefore, the proposed linearized /3 method of scintillometer is recommended to quantify the H, LE (Eo) over open water, especially when the water surface temperature cannot be accurately measured.					wang, shuqing/JRX-7812-2023; Han, Pengfei/F-9082-2018	Wang, Xu-Sheng/0000-0001-8736-2378; 													2199-899X						2018	379						433	442		10.5194/piahs-379-433-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/piahs-379-433-2018													WOS:000459240300058

The aim of this study is to create a precise model for the movement and dynamic of the floating reed islands in Srebarna Lake. This was done by creating a hybrid model (based on optical and SAR data), assessing the actually condition of floating reed islands, and applying it to quantify of the movement of floating reed islands to perform an actual and seasonal habitats monitoring. To create the hybrid model, the advantages of SAR data-Sentinel-1 for the hydrological dynamics monitoring of Srebarna Lake were used. The SAR data used were obtained for different time periods, within the observed seasons. Multispectral satellite data from Sentinel-2 was also used in order to apply an orthogonal transformation model called Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT). The Tasselled Cap model is a very effective method for classifying and analyzing processes related to the dynamics of changes affecting the main components of the Earth's surface: soil, water, and vegetation. This model proved to be very effective in recognizing specific types of vegetation and habitats, such as floating reed islands and their transformation over a period of time. The results for the reconciliation of TCT images and SAR data define very well the precise boundaries of both the central water body in Srebarna Lake, and the floating reed islands. The results obtained by means of comparative analysis confirm both methods as being equally effective to determine the floating reed islands dynamics in the hybrid model proposed in this study.

Production of Heterotrophic Bacterioplankton in a Large Meso-Eutrophic Reservoir: The Importance of Extracellular Organic Carbon Released by Phytoplankton	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of heterotrophic bacterioplankton production have been studied and the value of autochthonous sources of substrates for bacteria has been evaluated in the pelagic zone of the meso-eutrophic Rybinsk Reservoir (the Upper Volga). During the vegetation period, the bacterial production ranges from 32 to 1352 (on average 444 +/- 44) mg C/(m(2) x day). The total input of organic carbon from the processes of extracellular production of phytoplankton, viral lysis of prokaryotic cells, and feeding of protists provides 9-64% (32 +/- 3% on average) of the daily carbon demand for heterotrophic bacterioplankton.

Cover crops effects on grape yield and yield quality, and soil nitrate concentration in three vineyards in Ontario, Canada	VIII INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MINERAL NUTRITION OF FRUIT CROPS	Acta Horticulturae				8th International Symposium on Mineral Nutrition of Fruit Crops	JUN 27, 2017	Bolzano, ITALY	Int Soc Hort Sci				The biodiversity and resilience of wine grape production systems in humid temperate regions can be enhanced by cover crops. Individual and mixed species of cover crops were evaluated in 2014 and 2015 for their effect on vineyard productivity and soil properties in Prince Edward County (PEC), Niagara, and Lake Erie North Shore (LENS) in Ontario, Canada. Treatments included annual ryegrass (AR, control), annual ryegrass and red clover (AR+RC), annual ryegrass and forage radish (AR+FR), creeping fescue and micro clover (CF+MC), and a mixture of cover crops including oats, Italian ryegrass, red clover, alfalfa, alsike clover, and forage radish (Super Mix) and were replicated three times. Soil samples were collected once at bud break for soil properties (0-15 cm depth) and four times during the growing season for mineral N (0-30 cm depth; bud break, flowering, veraison and harvest). Results showed AR+RC and AR+FR treatments had the highest biomass in the PEC region, while AR+FR had the highest biomass in the Niagara and LENS regions averaged across years. The CF+MC treatment generally had poor establishment. Weed biomass was negatively correlated with cover crops biomass. Grape yield or yield quality (Brix, TA and YAN) and soil properties were not affected by treatments, except for AR that resulted in lower grape yield compared to other treatments in PEC in 2014. Soil nitrate concentrations, among treatments or sampling dates in each location, were not different in 2014. In 2015, soil nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in AR+RC and Super Mix treatments compared with the AR treatment only in Niagara and PEC. In conclusion, the AR+RC or AR+FR cover crops in the PEC vineyard and AR+FR in the Niagara and LENS vineyards showed high biomass and weed suppression compared to annual ryegrass with minimal cost differences.					; Sharifi, Mehdi/LKK-1824-2024	Sharifi, Mehdi/0000-0003-3136-6139; 													0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62612-14-3				2018	1217						247	256		10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1217.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1217.31													WOS:000467244200031

SPECIES COMPOSITION AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF THE ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY IN LAKE INORKI (MORDOVIA STATE NATURE RESERVE, RUSSIA)	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The present study is devoted to the study of species diversity and spatial distribution of the structural parameters of zooplankton community in the lake-oxbow Inorki in 2014 and 2016. The lake is in the middle right-bank floodplain of the River Moksha. The area of the lake is 0.209 km(2), the maximum length is about 3.7 km, the average width is about 95 m and the depth is 3.5-5.5 m. The riparian part of the lake is steep. And at a distance of 1-2 m from the shore the depths reach 1.5 m in most places. Zooplankton samples were taken on three stems (one in the centre, at a depth of >200 cm, and each shore, at a depth of 80 cm) in three sections from the boats early July 2014 (water temperature: 24-27 degrees C) and 2016 (water temperature: 21.5-22 degrees C) and treated by conventional methods. By compiling the list of zooplankton species, in Lake Inorki we have obtained the data of the three samples in June 2009 (54.7265 degrees N; 43.1523 degrees E) and five samples early July 2013. We have detected 93 species and forms of zooplankton. There are rotifer species of the Middle Volga region: Asplanchnopus multiceps, Euchlanis proxima, Squatinella mutica, S. rostrum, S. tridentat., Trichocerca weberi which prefer the overgrown and waterlogged water bodies. 11 species in Lake Inorki have been registered in all years of study: Asplanchna priodonta, Conochilus hippocrepis, Keratella cochlearis, Lecane closterocerca, Mytilina ventralis, Synchaeta pectinata, Testudinella patina, Chydorus sphaericus, Graptoleberis testudinaria, Sida crystallina, Mesocyclops leuckarti. The average abundance of zooplankton is significantly higher in the pelagic part of the lake than in its coastal zone (t = 8.82-11.38, at p < 0.05). The taxonomic structure of zooplankton community showed differences. So, in 2014 rotifers dominated, while in 2016 the abundance of nauplial stages copepod was the highest. Perhaps, at the time of sampling in 2016, the zooplankton community was at the earlier stage of seasonal dynamics due to low water temperature. This year there was a smaller number of dominant species and a high spatial homogeneity. The ratio of ecological zooplankton groups was different through the years and parts of sampling. In 2014 verticators mainly dominated. Moreover, their percentage was the highest (78%) in the open part of the lake. In 2016 apart from filter-feeders, the zooplankton community was presented by a high proportion of grabbers, nauplii and Copepods larvae: their proportions were 65% and 50% near the lake shores and 44% in the centre of the lake. The state of Lake Inorki has been estimated as mesotrophic according to the Shannon index and the trophy coefficient.

J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG; Alam, SR				Fang, X; Stefan, HG; Alam, SR			Simulation and validation of fish thermal DO habitat in north-central US lakes under different climate scenarios	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Fish habitat in lakes is strongly constrained by water temperature and available dissolved oxygen (DO). Suitable fish habitat for three fish assemblages (cold-, cool-, and warm-water) in Minnesota (US) lakes was therefore determined from simulated daily water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles. A total of 27 types of lakes were simulated under past (1961-1979) and a projected 2 x CO2 climate scenarios. The projected climate scenario was derived from the output of the Canadian Climate Center General Circulation Model for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. A verified, process-oriented, unsteady and one-dimensional (vertical) year-round lake water quality model (MINLAKE96) was used for the temperature and DO simulations, which were run in a continuous mode over 19 years. Water temperature and DO criteria for survival and good-growth of each fish guild were provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Simulated suitable fish habitats were compared with fish observations in 3002 Minnesota lakes. Winterkill was simulated to occur in shallow eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes under past climate conditions, and predicted to disappear under the projected 2 x CO2 climate scenario due to a shortening of the ice cover period. Sensitivity of the simulated winterkill to three DO survival limits was analyzed. A lower DO (less than 0.5 mg/l) limit for winterkill produced better agreement with a fish observation database than higher limits. Dependence of the simulated good-growth habitat areas (GGHA) and volumes (GGHV) on the geometry (surface area and maximum depth) and trophic state of a lake was also examined. Fish habitat parameters were found to depend more strongly on geometry and less on trophic state. Climate change is projected to increase GGHA in seasonally stratified (medium-depth and deep) lakes on the average by 50 and 115% for cool-water and warm-water fish guilds, respectively. It is also projected that cold-water fish species will have a small percentage loss in weakly stratified (medium-depth) lakes, but a small percentage gain of GGHA in deep, strongly stratified lakes.

J	ANDERSON, MP; CHENG, XX				ANDERSON, MP; CHENG, XX			LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM TRANSIENCE IN A GROUNDWATER LAKE SYSTEM IN WISCONSIN, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A 10 year record of water level fluctuations in a groundwater/lake system in northern Wisconsin shows that system dynamics are strongly influenced by seasonal transient effects as well as transience over the 10 year period of record. These data were collected for the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program at the North Temperate Lakes site in northern Wisconsin, USA. The record included a period of relatively high lake levels from 1981 to 1985, followed by declining levels in 1986-1987 and low levels in 1988-1990. Short-term transient effects in the form of seasonal groundwater mounds consistently occurred on all sides of the lake during 1981-1985 when regional water levels were high and during 1986-1988 when groundwater levels were high relative to the declining lake level. Mounds did not form after 1988. These observations point to the importance of a long-term record in assessing the significance of short-term effects. Short-term transience affects the groundwater component of the lake budget because the mounds induce groundwater to flow toward the lake; when the mounds are not present, water flows away from the lake. Shifts in the groundwater regime will affect the lake's chemical budget in the long term. However, the trends in the chemical budget that occurred within our 10 year record, an inter-val shorter than the hydraulic residence time of the lake (12.7 year), are influenced more by changes in precipitation inputs than groundwater inputs.																			0022-1694					MAY 1	1993	145	1-2					1	18		10.1016/0022-1694(93)90217-W	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(93)90217-W													WOS:A1993KY53900001
J	Ito, T				Ito, Takuma			Preservation potential of seasonal laminated deposits as a useful tool for environmental analysis in mesotrophic Lake Kizaki, central Japan	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												In this paper discusses the aquatic environment at Lake Kizaki, central Japan, during the last ca. 60 years and describes the importance of laminated sediments in environmental analyses. The flux of total algal carbon increased between 1965 and 1996 while the BSi flux, which can be used in diatom production, showed a larger increase between 1960 and 1998 than typically occurs on average. The flux of dinosterol, an indicator of dinoflagellate production, also increased from 1966 to 1998, and the sedimentary dinoflagellate record correlated with observations of freshwater red tides caused by dinoflagellate blooms. Parallel laminated sediment was determined to have appeared between 1960 and 1995, corresponding to a period of high total algal carbon levels and BSi fluxes. For lamina formation and its preservation process, the thickness of the oxygen-poor layer depended on excessive total algal production during stagnant periods and appeared to be important because nutrients were diffused and accumulated in the oxygen-poor layer from bottom sediments. This could result in diatom blooms at the next overturn period. The development of the thick oxygen-poor layer appeared to be triggered primarily by the presence of excessive nutrients generated by human activities. In general, the occurrence of laminated sediments can provide a useful tool for understanding the eutrophic state in Lake Kizaki. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The one sucker (Chasmistes horns) is an endangered potamodromous species endemic to Utah Lake. Larval June suckers have not been collected from Utah Lake for at least 3 decades. Recruitment appears to be limited by low temperatures and scarce food, resulting in mass starvation of larval June suckers in the stream environment. We compared water temperature, zooplankton food availability, and small fish abundance in the stream and in 3 habitats along the stream-lake ecotone (dense emergent vegetation, sparse emergent vegetation, and open lake) to test the hypothesis that all 3 factors would reach a maximum in the dense emergent vegetation of the stream-lake ecotone. We used the abundance of fathead minnows in each habitat type as a surrogate for small fish like juvenile June suckers. We found that temperature, food, and fathead minnows reached their maximums in the open lake rather than in vegetated habitats of the stream-lake ecotone. The stream had the lowest average temperatures (15.1 degrees C) and the lowest zooplankton concentrations (61 . L(-1)) over the growing season. Contrary to expectations, low temperatures (16.9 degrees C) and low food abundance (505 . L(-1)) also characterized the densely vegetated habitat, whereas the open lake had the highest temperatures (20.4 degrees C) and highest concentrations of zooplankton (2353 . L(-1)). Restoration should include a mechanism to transport larval fish through the densely vegetated portion of the stream-lake ecotone, which can be hundreds of meters wide, to the wants productive waters of the open lake. The braided planform of the terminal reaches of Hobble Creek should be replaced with shallow riffles to increase mean stream velocity and decrease the transport time of larval June suckers.

Densities of young pines beneath oak canopies were approximately six times greater than in treeless areas, and densities on the north sides of the trees were significantly greater than on the south sides. However, oaks younger than 35 yr showed no preferential establishment beneath them, while the pine population structures beneath older oaks indicated single periods of successful recruitment. Pine seed planted beneath and beyond oak canopies of three sizes germinated primarily beneath the canopies of medium and large-sized oaks, but subsequent survivorship of seedlings over two growing seasons was poor. Several micro-environmental conditions were changed by oak canopies, but only shade showed a pattern closely corresponding to that of seedling establishment. A habitat manipulation experiment confirmed the primary role of shade in facilitating pine seedling establishment beneath oaks. Failure of pine to continue recruiting successfully beneath facilitating trees is tentatively attributed to intraspecific competition among pine individuals.																			1100-9233					DEC	1992	3	5					679	688		10.2307/3235836	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3235836													WOS:A1992KA46600014

Seasonal Forecast of Local Lake-Effect Snowfall: The Case of Buffalo, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The climate and weather patterns of Buffalo (New York, U.S.A.) are strongly influenced by the city's proximity to Lake Erie. Total monthly snowfall in Buffalo is forecasted using neural network techniques (Multi-Layer Perceptron = MLP) and a multiple linear regression (LR) model. The period of analysis comprises 28 years from January 1982 to December 2009. Input data include: zonal wind speed (u-wind), meridional wind speed (v-wind), air temperature, the geopotential height (GPH) over Lake Erie and the surrounding regions at the 1000 mb -, 925 mb 850 mb -, and 700 mb - levels as well as the surface pressure and air temperature, mean water temperature, lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) and the amount of ice coverage of Lake Erie; the 500 mb GPH over James Bay, Canada; and the surface pressure over the North-Central Great Plains. Different lead times of the input variables are tested for their suitability. The most accurate result is obtained by using the MLP with an optimum lead time approach (lead times vary for the different input variables between one and six months). The results of the MLP with six months lead time are in good agreement with observed precipitation records over the study period.

J	Yamamoto, Y; Shiah, FK				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo			Spatial variation in reproductive measures of female bluegill Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque in a small lake with diverse thermal conditions	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												Background: Our previous studies have revealed that bluegill Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque in Lake Biwa exhibit spatial variations in growth, maturation, and reproduction. The topographical characteristics of Lake Biwa produce a wide range of thermal conditions, which seem to be responsible for those findings. Despite its small size, Lake Yogo is characterized by diverse thermal conditions owing to the presence of a small, shallow pool in the northern part of the lake and the inflow of water from Lake Biwa into the southern part of the lake. Whether bluegill in such a small lake also exhibit spatially varying physiological activity remains uncertain. Results: The maturation status of female bluegill in Lake Yogo was investigated from late April to early June 2011 and in late May 2012. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) of the fish in the pool significantly exceeded those in the main lake in late April and mid-May 2011 before the onset of spawning. The spawning of bluegill had probably already begun by late May 2012, and the fish in the pool and along the northwestern edge of the lake had smaller GSIs than did the fish in the southern part of the lake. The relationship between oocyte diameter and GSI could be described by a saturation function. The plot of GSI/oocyte diameter vs. GSI did not vary significantly among the sites. Conclusions: The maturation status of bluegill varied among sites in Lake Yogo, likely to be due to the diverse thermal conditions of the lake. Higher temperatures in the pool during the prespawning season favored the rapid maturation of ovaries of the fish therein. The inflowing colder water from Lake Biwa seemed to be responsible for delayed ovary maturation and, thereby, the delay in the spawning season of bluegill in the southern part of the lake.

The goals of this study were to quantify patterns of carbon flow and test hypotheses of top-down versus bottom-up controls on this system. The model included seven trophic groups: bacteria, photosynthetic nanoflagellates (PNAN), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN), ciliates (bacterial feeding and flagellate feeding), phytoplankton and rotifers (the top predator); all inputs were driven by predatory demands. This system has no insects, vertebrates, crustacea or allochthonous inputs from terrestrial plants. Autotrophs and bacteria contributed ca. 94% of total community biomass, with all other heterotrophic organisms representing < 6% of the total. We defined a measure of trophic efficiency (lambda) as the ratio of carbon uptake by rotifers to total carbon uptake by all trophic groups. lambda was always < 2% of total community carbon flow and seldom correlated to other flows of carbon through the system. Sensitivity analysis revealed that. was relatively insensitive to efficiency of carbon transfers between other components of the food web. In total, these results suggest little top-down influence of the top predator on system dynamics. Conversely, major fluctuations in total community biomass followed general patterns of seasonal and inter-annual availability of PAR, suggesting bottom-up control on this system.

This paper reports the experimental design for ABLE 3B and a brief overview of results. The detailed results are presented in a series of papers in this issue. The chemical composition of the atmospheric mixed layer over remote tundra, boreal wetland, and forested environments was influenced by emissions of CH4 and nonmethane hydrocarbons from biogenic sources, emissions of gases and aerosols from local biomass burning, and transport of pollutants into the study areas from urban/industrial sources. Minimum concentrations of both trace gas and aerosol species in boundary layer air were associated with Arctic source areas. In the free troposphere the biospheric influence was undetectable, and major sources of chemical variability were related to long-range transport of pollutants into the study areas from biomass burning and industrial sources in Alaska and the Great Lakes regions, respectively. Minimum concentrations of both trace gas and aerosol species in the free troposphere were associated with a persistent, widespread air mass which both chemistry and air mass trajectory analyses suggested had originated in the tropical Pacific. Subsidence of air from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere frequently enhanced ozone and influenced other trace gas and aerosol species at midtropospheric altitudes. The North American Arctic is a complex dynamical and chemical environment with considerable spatial and temporal variability in aerosol and trace gas concentrations. The use of atmospheric chemical indicators for climate change detection will require a much more comprehensive Arctic monitoring program than currently exists.																			2169-897X					JAN 20	1994	99	D1					1635	1643		10.1029/93JD01788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JD01788													WOS:A1994MT03200049
J	Starliper, CE; Morrison, P				Starliper, CE; Morrison, P			Bacterial pathogen contagion studies among freshwater bivalves and salmonid fishes	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												A part of the conservation efforts of native freshwater bivalves is a relocation program whereby animals are collected and moved to a safe refuge for maintenance and propagation. With the rearing of two different hosts, mussels and fish, on the same facility there is a question of the possibility for contagion of pathogens. The studies presented here are part of a continuing effort to address the concerns of contagion. Freshwater bivalves collected throughout the 1997 season were cultured for fish pathogens. Counts of total bacteria on cytophaga medium ranged between 1.07 x 10(5) and 4.99 x 10(5) cfu/g of mussel soft tissues. The predominate groups of bacteria were motile Aeromonas spp. and Pseudomonas spp., both of which include members that are opportunistic pathogens to salmonid fishes. No primary fish pathogens were cultured; however, cells with correct morphology for Renibacterium salmoninarum, cause of bacterial kidney disease, were detected from mussel soft tissues in all six trials using the direct fluorescent antibody test. Groups of mussels were subjected to 24-h waterborne challenges using bacteria cultured from healthy fish. no mortality occurred to any of the animals. Another group exposed to the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida also showed no effects of the challenge; however, susceptible fish became infected and died after the fish were added to cohabit with this group of mussels.																			0730-8000					JUN	2000	19	1					251	258																WOS:000088636000041
J	Warne, AG; Toth, LA; White, WA				Warne, AG; Toth, LA; White, WA			Drainage-basin-scale geomorphic analysis to determine reference conditions for ecologic restoration - Kissimmee River, Florida	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Major controls on the retention, distribution, and discharge of surface water in the historic (precanal) Kissimmee drainage basin and river were investigated to determine reference conditions for ecosystem restoration. Precanal Kissimmee drainage-basin hydrology was largely controlled by landforms derived from relict, coastal ridge, lagoon, and shallow-shelf features; widespread carbonate solution depressions; and a poorly developed fluvial drainage network. Prior to channelization for flood control, the Kissimmee River was a very low gradient, moderately meandering river that flowed from Lake Kissimmee to Lake Okeechobee through the lower drainage basin. We infer that during normal wet seasons, river discharge rapidly exceeded Lake Okeechobee outflow capacity, and excess surface water hacked up into the low-gradient Kissimmee River. This backwater effect induced bankfull and peak discharge early in the flood cycle and transformed the flood plain into a shallow aquatic system with both lacustrine and riverine characteristics. The large volumes of surface water retained in the lakes and wetlands of the upper basin maintained overbank now conditions for several months after peak discharge. Analysis indicates that most of the geomorphic work on the channel and flood plain occurred during the frequently recurring extended periods of overbank discharge and that discharge volume may have been significant in determining channel dimensions. Comparison of hydrogeomorphic relationships with other river systems identified links between geomorphology and hydrology of the precanal Kissimmee River. However, drainage-basin and hydraulic geometry models derived solely from general populations of river systems may produce spurious reference conditions for restoration design criteria.																			0016-7606					JUN	2000	112	6					884	899		10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112<884:DGATDR>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112<884:DGATDR>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000087316900007

Day and night sampling was conducted in July and August at 16 different study stations with net hauls from the bottom to the surface. Independently on the month, estimated biomasses were more than two times higher at night than at day. This was due to both higher density and larger individual length at night. The day-night differences could not be explained by vertical or horizontal migrations or by bottom-dwelling behavior by Leptodora, but were attributed to net avoidance. When light was present, more Leptodora were able to avoid the net haul than in the darkness. The avoidance was more effective by large adult individuals (>5mm) than by juveniles, which amplified the day-night difference in the population biomass estimate. In order to evaluate the role of large pelagic invertebrate predators in aquatic food webs, nighttime sampling should be used.

Freshly emerged cercariae therefore were exposed to either standardized water, Oder River (Germany/Poland) or Lake Odersee (Germany) extracts of aqueous sediments; mortality patterns and mean survival times (MSTs) were compared. Cercariae added to extracts of aqueous sediments from the Oder River and Lake Odersee exhibited impaired survival with significantly different mortality pattern and reduced MST compared to that of controls. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.843, p < 0.05) was found between MST and mercury content of sediments, indicating a potential impact of mercury on survival of Diplostomum sp. cercariae. The results indicate that contamination of freshwater habitats may influence the viability of free-living transmission stages of helminth parasites of fish and may thus be of epizootiological significance.					; Marcogliese, David/ABG-4982-2022	Pietrock, Michael/0000-0001-9244-0588; Steinberg, Christian E.W./0000-0002-3132-8901; 													0090-4341	1432-0703				APR	2001	40	3					327	332											11443362					WOS:000167524900005

Tree ring crossdating shows that seven bark-bearing trees from one of these recent slides and a tree 23 kilometers to the northwest in a probable tsunami deposit on the shore of Puget Sound died in the same season of the same year. The close coincidence among the most recent lake landslides, a probable tsunami, abrupt subsidence, and other possible seismic events gives evidence for a strong prehistoric earthquake in the Seattle region.

J	REAP, RM				REAP, RM			ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF LIGHTNING STRIKE DISTRIBUTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SYNOPTIC MAP TYPES OVER FLORIDA	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The temporal and spatial distributions of lightning activity associated with specific synoptic regimes of low-level wind flow were analyzed as part of an experiment to develop improved statistical thunderstorm forecasts for Florida. The synoptic regimes were identified by means of a linear correlation technique that was used to perform pattern classification or ''map typing'' of 18- and 30-h sea level pressure forecasts from the National Meteorological Center's Nested Grid Model (NGM). Lightning location data for the 1987-90 warm seasons were subsequently analyzed on a 12-km grid to determine the thunderstorm distribution for each of the predetermined map types. The analysis revealed organized coastal maxima in lightning activity related to land-sea-breeze convergence zones that form in direct response to the low-level wind flow. Surface effects were also indicated by the persistent minima in lightning activity over Lake Okeechobee and by the lightning maxima found in regions with shoreline curvature favoring localized convergence. Experimental thunderstorm probability equations for Florida were subsequently developed from climatological lightning frequencies and NGM forecast fields. The lightning frequencies were combined with the K stability index to form interactive predictors that take into account the temporal and spatial variations in lightning occurrence for each map type but modulate the climatology in response to the daily large-scale synoptic situation. The statistical forecast equations were developed for each map type in an attempt to simulate the effects of small-scale processes, such as land-sea-breeze convergence zones, on the subsequent development of peninsular-scale convection.																			0027-0644					AUG	1994	122	8					1698	1715		10.1175/1520-0493(1994)122<1698:AAPOLS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1994)122<1698:AAPOLS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1994NY97300003

The Prungle Lakes are part of the now dry Willandra Lakes system in semi-arid southwestern New South Wales. The Willandra Lakes have been a site of cyclic Quaternary sedimentation in response to the well documented global climatic fluctuations associated with the glacial-interglacial cycle. At times of hydrologic stress, low lake levels are associated with high salt volumes, inherited from evaporative concentration in large shallow lakes upstream and the inflow of saline groundwaters. Thus, at Prungle, a complex array of concentric shorelines, lake floor terraces and lunettes has developed as basin-within-basin landforms which formed in response to filling and drying cycles. Sediments associated with these geomorphic units include: (1) Freshwater littoral, nearshore and deep-water deposited laminated sands and muds, with biogenic carbonates chiefly of ostracodal and algal origin; (2) Evaporites comprising interbedded clay and laminated gypsum-clay couplets, which consist of discrete thin laminae of sugary white euhedral prismatic gypsum separated by detrital clay layers with a high degree of optical orientation. Primary accessory celestite (SrSO4) occurs as discrete patches within the gypsum laminae; (3) Groundwater pyramidal, discoidal or lenticular gypsum crystals, grown from supersaturation produced by evaporation at the capillary fringe of the water table. These have formed displacively within the sediments and caused considerable disruption of the sediment matrix; (4) Aeolian deposition in irregular transverse ridges of sand-sized reworked groundwater gypsum and disrupted lacustrine clays. The gypsum crystals are predominantly discoidal pyramidal forms which are conspicuously oriented parallel to bedding, well sorted and extensively corroded. The clay pellets are well sorted and moderately well rounded. Higher in the profile, bedding is indistinct due to pedogenic processes, which include modification of detrital grains and secondary crystallization of gypsum and carbonate. A thin gypcrete horizon occurs at the surface. The last cycle of sedimentation in the Prungle Lakes is believed, from correlation with lakes higher in the Willandra System, to have occurred during the period 50,000-16,000 yr B.P. Since then groundwaters have dropped below the zone of interaction with the lake floor and surface water no longer reaches the lakes. Sedimentation has ceased and soil formation with secondary carbonate and gypsum has continued to the present. A range of sedimentary environments is identified which depend on strong seasonal oscillations. These environments are virtually absent from the Australian continent today, and their occurrence during the Pleistocene supports the contention of enhanced climatic seasonality at that time. The array of sediment types and mineralogies is almost identical to that characteristic of coastal sabkha sequences highlighting the difficulty of relying on unusual evaporative mineralogy to differentiate marine and non-marine environments. Detailed petrographic analyses of the Prungle sequence have been made in association with a review of theoretical, experimental and observational studies of the environmental controls of calcium sulfate mineralogy and crystal habit. This has enabled the correlation at Prungle of depositional environment with gypsum petrofacies and associated compositional, fabric or structural features. These observations are more generally applicable to other evaporite deposits. Many gypsum evaporites reported in the literature have been compared with this scheme developed at Prungle.																			0031-0182					MAY	1991	84	1-4					3	42		10.1016/0031-0182(91)90033-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(91)90033-N													WOS:A1991FU23800002

Quantitative Characteristics of Soil Mesofauna in the Semidesert Solonetzic Complex of the North Caspian Region	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The results of long-term quantitative assessments of the invertebrate populations inhabiting the soils of a clayey semidesert are analyzed. The dominant species in the different soils of a solonetzic soil complex are compared. The distribution patterns of the dominant groups of invertebrates in relation to the soil and vegetation complexity dictated by the clearly expressed microrelief are discussed. The changes in the populations of the soil invertebrates are considered against the background of changes in the precipitation during the growing season in different years. It is shown that the population density of the soil invertebrates varies within broad limits in all the soils of the complex. At the same time, it remains considerably lower in the solonchakous solonetzes of the microhighs in comparison with that in the soils of the slopes and microlows. The most contrasting differences in the species composition and the numbers of soil invertebrates are observed for the solonetzes of the microhighs and the meadow-chestnut soils of the microlows.

SAR-based estimates of the size distribution of lakes in Brazil and Canada: a tool for investigating carbon in lakes	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. The size of lakes and the size distribution of lakes are important parameters controlling lake function, and how lakes interact with landscapes, the atmosphere and ecosystems. A baseline digital database of lakes could be used to improve understanding of lake function, to extrapolate lake information to regional and global scales, and as a basis for detecting future changes to lakes. 2. This paper examines the capabilities of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery produced by the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) to map the number and size distribution of lakes in western Arctic Canada, Central Canada and the Pantanal (Brazil). 3. For the Arctic and Pantanal, the total area found within one lake size category increases towards smaller lakes. The opposite was 2 true for the area in Central Canada. The number of lakes in the smallest size category, 0.01 to 0.1 km, was underestimated for all regions owing to the resolution of the mosaics - 100 x 100 m. The number of large lakes in the Pantanal was over-estimated through confusion with intermittent floodways that are scrubby grasslands and bare sand in the dry season and which exhibit low backscattering and therefore appear dark like lakes. 4. The lake distributions were combined with existing data to produce preliminary 2 regional estimates of carbon accumulation. Lakes may accumulate as much as 1.7 and 1.3 t C km(-2) yr(-1) for the Arctic Canadian and Central Canadian areas, respectively. No estimates were produced for the Pantanal because there are no applicable data on carbon accumulation rates available for that region. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Generally, values for each proximate component and energy content for sturgeon of a given size did not vary between June and October but were different in March. Lipid and protein contents varied inversely with water when each was expressed as a percentage of whole body weight. Hepatosomatic index declined with total length and did not differ between June and October; in March, values were lower. The relative water, protein, and inorganic content of liver decreased and lipid and energy content increased with total length.

J	VANSTEMPVOORT, DR; HENDRY, MJ; SCHOENAU, JJ; KROUSE, HR				VANSTEMPVOORT, DR; HENDRY, MJ; SCHOENAU, JJ; KROUSE, HR			SOURCES AND DYNAMICS OF SULFUR IN WEATHERED TILL, WESTERN GLACIATED PLAINS OF NORTH-AMERICA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												At three sites in the western Glaciated Plains, Warman and Luck Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada, and Bow River in Alberta, Canada, thick (greater than or equal to 30 m) till sequences contain similar to 0.3-0.8% S by dry weight. In the unweathered zone (depths>2.5-15 m), 65-90% of this S is Cr-reducible pyrite. The remainder, largely organic S, is enriched in S-34 by 6-12 parts per thousand relative to the pyrite. At the Bow River site, both pyrite and organic S are enriched in S-34 (by up to 9 parts per thousand) relative to samples of the same fractions from the Warman and Luck Lake sites. This may reflect a higher content of non-marine parent material in southern Alberta till. At the Warman site, the sources and dynamics of sulfur in the weathered zone were investigated. During weathering of the Floral Formation till, sulfate was produced by the oxidation of pyrite, and to a lesser extent by mineralization of organic S. Based on the distribution of SO4 in the landscape at Warman, three settings have been distinguished: upland, leached channel depression and saline ring. The upland setting has a >9-m-thick weathered zone, which contains abundant SO4, mainly as secondary gypsum. Sulfate has been leached downward from the upper 2 m, creating a peak accumulation of gypsum at similar to 3 m. Sulfate has been leached from the entire 2.5-m-deep weathered zone in the channel depression setting by seasonal infiltration of snow-melt and lateral flow. In contrast, at similar to 3-4-m depth in the weathered zone at the edge of the channel, SO4 has accumulated as a saline ring; here the gypsum-S is up to 1% of the soil (dry weight). In the weathered zone of upland and saline ring settings, the delta(34)S-values of the SO4 in sediment extracts (water-soluble) and groundwater (-13.1 to -9.0 parts per thousand) are very similar to those of the total S (-12.0 to -11.4 parts per thousand) and pyrite S (-16.0 to -10.1 parts per thousand) of unweathered Floral Formation till. This indicates an in situ weathering source of the SO4. In contrast, the delta(34)S of SO4 in sediment extracts and groundwater from the leached weathered zone of the upland and channel depression settings (-7.7 to -4.5 parts per thousand) is enriched in S-34 relative to unweathered Floral Formation till S. This enrichment may be attributed to either: (1) isotope fractionation during oxidation of pyrite, and/or (2) mineralization of residual organic S, which is S-34-enriched, after pyrite was weathered away.

A geographic information system (GIS) was used to record and measure landscape variables derived from aerial photos. Twenty-seven watershed land-use and land-cover variables were reduced to eight principal components which described 85% of the variance among watersheds. Relationships between lake water quality variables and the first six principal components plus an index of lake mixis were analyzed through stepwise multiple regression analysis. A combination of three landscape components (wetland/watershed area, agriculture/wetlands, and forest/soils components) explained 49% of the variance in a trophic state index, even though most of the lakes examined were already highly eutrophic, and thus were influenced by internal loading. The regression equations explained a range of 14 to 76% of the variation in individual water quality variables. Forested land-use was associated with lower lake trophic state, chloride, and lead. High lake trophic state was associated with agricultural land-use and with wetland distance from the lake of interest. The extent of wetlands was associated with low total lead and high color in lakes downstream. Wet meadows or herbaceous, seasonally-flooded wetlands contributed more to lake water color than did cattail marshes.

But ungauged or poorly gauged conditions limit the study and understanding of hydrological regimes of these wetland types. This study selects an ungauged subalpine wetland - Napahai in Northwest Yunnan, China - as a case for developing a practical approach to revealing its storage-area relationship of open water. A Trimble R8 GNSS (Global Navigation Satellites Systems) RTK (Real-time Kinematic system) and sonar fathometer were used to survey fine-resolution elevation data and generate a digital elevation model of the Napahai Wetland. Forty-four Landsat images from 1987 to 2011 were collected, and the Normalized Difference Water Index was used to classify open water features in the area. The area of open water in Napahai was calculated for each phase. With these data and a developed conceptual model, the storage of open water for each phase was estimated using ArcGIS tools. Both storage and area of open water showed significant intra-annual and inter-annual variations. In the rainy season, the monthly change of average storage of open water in Napahai showed about 1-2 months lag behind mean monthly rainfall. The storage-area relationship of open water was well fit by a power function equation (R (2)a parts per thousand 0.91, n=44). This study indicates that if detailed elevations are available for similarly ungauged subalpine wetlands in Southwest China, researchers can use this practical approach to estimate multi-temporal areas and storages and reveal the storage-area relationship of open water in the wetlands. The study provided valuable information of this case wetland for optimizing its hydro-ecological managements and a new method to wetland researchers and managers for the hydrological study of similarly ungauged wetland complex.

J	Wilson, P; Clark, R				Wilson, P; Clark, R			Characteristics and implications of some Loch Lomond Stadial moraine ridges and later landforms, eastern Lake District, northern England	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Moraine ridges and mounds of inferred Loch Lomond Stadial (LLS) age have been mapped at three sites (Fordingdale, Swindale and Wet Sleddale) in part of the eastern Lake District, northern England, and indicate glaciers were more widespread than envisaged by Sissons (1980, Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, Vol. 71, pp. 13-27). The moraines delimit closely the downslope/downvalley limits of the former glaciers but there is no geomorphological evidence with which to define their upslope/upvalley margins. The former glaciers are considered to have been nourished within the confines of their individual valley, cirque and hillside embayment respectively, rather than being outlet glaciers of plateau icefields. Estimated equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) are within the range of values determined previously for LLS glaciers in the Lake District and do not necessitate revision of established palaeoclimatic parameters. Individual ELAs were probably influenced by local factors; all three former glaciers had accumulation-area aspects between north and east, limiting the impact of direct solar radiation during the ablation season, and were adjacent to extensive areas of high ground to the west and/or south that would have facilitated transfer of snow to their surfaces by winds from those directions. In Fordingdale, three essentially contemporaneous depositional landforms occur upslope of the moraines and are considered to represent hillslope adjustments following wastage of glacier ice from the site.

Brown trout starred taking fish at a body length of approximately 20 cm. From 30 cm, fish was the dominant prey. There are eight fish species in the lake: all except minnow have been recorded in brown trout stomachs. Whitefish constituted 68 % of the identified prey fish. 88 % of the whitefish eaten were between 80 and 179 mm in length, and there was a significant increase in whitefish prey size with predator size. The brown trout and the vulnerable whitefish size groups only partly overlap in habitat use. There are three whitefish morphs in Lake Femund, differing in morphology and ecology. As growth rates differ among the morphs, they are vulnerable to brown trout predation during different periods of their juvenile life span. The results are discussed in relation to predator-prey habitat use and growth rates.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						283	294																WOS:000078180200028
J	Shine, JP; Ryan, DK; Ford, TE				Shine, JP; Ryan, DK; Ford, TE			Annual cycle of heavy metals in a tropical lake - Lake Chapala, Mexico	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Dissolved concentrations of seven metals (As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr) were determined monthly at six sampling stations in Lake Chapala, Mexico, between November 1990 and December, 1991. Lake Chapala is the largest lake in Mexico, and serves as a source of drinking water and an economically important fishery and center for tourism. Historically, Lake Chapala has received poorly characterized domestic, industrial, and agricultural wastes. As, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Zn displayed peaks in concentration during the period before the rainy season due, presumably, to evaporation. Comparison of inflow and outflow concentrations also indicated a direct source of As to the lake. During this period, the concentrations of both Cd and Pb were above the freshwater chronic criteria values recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for protection of aquatic ecosystem health. The metals As, Cr, Zn, Ni, and Cu also showed concentration peaks following the rainy season in August and September, perhaps due to increased input from the watershed or resuspension of metals in the lake driven by changes in water circulation patterns. Concentration data for the lake also suggested that a portion of the inflow water does not immediately mix with the lake as a whole, creating spatial gradients depending on the concentration of metals in the source water. Determination of metals in water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) plant tissue showed large partitioning of metals into root tissue, indicating that plants may be an important temporal sink for metals. In addition, copper and zinc accumulated to very high levels in Tilapia and Carp livers, indicating that some of the metal contaminants are entering the food chain.

J	Cammarano, P; Manca, M				Cammarano, P; Manca, M			Studies on zooplankton in two acidified high mountain lakes in the Alps	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Being located in remote areas, alpine lakes are good indicators of regional and global pollution, and are particularly sensitive to atmospheric depositions. When situated in areas where acidic rocks dominate, they are sensitive to acidification. In the framework of an international project partially funded by the EU, a two-year study on zooplankton was carried out on two lakes, Lake Paione Inferiore (LPI) and Lake Paione Superiore (LPS), selected because of their susceptibility to acidification. In particular, LPS is permanently acidified, with pH ranging between 5.3 and 6.2, and LPI is acidified during the ice melt, when pH drops to 6.1 units. In addition, LPI is subjected to further anthropogenic interference, since fish (Onchorynchus mykiss) have been repeatedly introduced into the lake during the last thirty years. Literature information is available on the species composition and the seasonal dynamics of the zooplankton communities of the two lakes before these anthropogenic disturbances took place. Previously, the two lakes had a similar species composition and abundant zooplankton. An analysis of the present-day situation reveals significant changes compared to the past. Both acidification and the introduction of fish are responsible for the marked alterations observed. By reconstructing of the past cladocera assemblages and by analysing the literature on lakes with different impacts of the two factors (pH and fish), we can estimate the relative importance of the two different anthropogenic disturbances on species composition and abundance of the zooplankton communities of the two lakes.																			0018-8158					OCT 10	1997	356						97	109		10.1023/A:1003179314456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003179314456													WOS:000071763000010

Low levels of Hg and Cd were found in Baikal seals in comparison with those of marine mammals and it was due to their low concentrations in dietary fish. These results suggest that pollution by Hg and Cd was low in Lake Baikal and these toxic elements were unlikely to be the causative factors for mass mortality of Baikal seal in 1987-1988. Significant correlation of Hg concentration between hair and internal tissues suggested the use of hair for Hg monitoring in pinnipeds. Among essential elements, higher Fe and lower Cu levels were specifically found in the liver of Baikal seal, The noticeable accumulation of essential elements might be related to the unique and specific environment of Lake Baikal.

J	Whitfield, AK				Whitfield, AK			A review of factors influencing fish utilization of South African estuaries	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA												The distribution and abundance of teleosts found in southern African estuaries are determined by both biotic and abiotic variables. Factors which have already been shown to have an influence on estuarine-associated fishes are latitude, seasonality catchment size, estuary size, axial salinity gradients, habitat diversity, estuary type, mouth depth and degree of marine influence, timing of the open phase, the ability of species to adjust to salinity and temperature fluctuations, dissolved oxygen levels, turbidity, available food resources, the occurrence and severity of floods, trapping of organic material by impoundments, nearshore marine conditions, physical constrictions within estuarine systems, predation, competition, parasite loads, reproductive condition, juvenile cohort abundance, and habitat degradation as a result of pollution or dredging. The influence of several of the above variables on ichthyofaunal diversity and abundance are reviewed, with particular emphasis on salinity fluctuations as a primary factor affecting fish communities. A summary diagram of the biotic and abiotic variables affecting fishes, as well as a conceptual model on the influence of high turbidity on the foraging strategies of selected teleosts, is presented.

The post-release evolution of water-column structure has been monitored through April 1992. Changes began immediately after the event as rainfall and inflow brought dilute fluid into the surface layer. Inflow and surface mixing have gradually deepened the chemocline. The Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) values in the upper 40 m of the water column have dropped from a few hundred mg/kg just after the release to <100 mg/kg. The chemocline is presently strongest at 50 m depth; 5 m below this, the TDS = 570 mg/kg. From 55 to 150 m depth is a gentle gradient in which TDS reaches 920 mg/kg. Little change in water-column chemistry has occurred in this depth interval since the release. Between 150 m depth and lake bottom at 210 m depth, a strong secondary chemocline has formed. Temperature, CO2 concentration ([CO2]), and TDS have all increased in the deepest layer in response to recharge by warm, mineralized water, reaching values of 25.0-degrees-C, 320 mmol/kg, and 1800 mg/kg, respectively, 1 m above lake bottom. Considering all these changes in part as a ''recovery'' process, it is possible to construct a model of the pre-release water column. The data indicate that the pre-release chemocline was at least 50 m deep. Above the chemocline was a dilute layer containing a seasonal thermocline; below the chemocline was probably a gradient zone(s) with correlated increases in TDS and [CO2] and a secondary chemocline near lake bottom. Maximum values of TDS and [CO2] calculated for pre-release bottom water are 2400 mg/kg and 430 mmol/kg, respectively, based on tritium data. From this pre-release structure, a model of the gas release is proposed that is consistent with available chemical and observational data. An important feature of the model is that disruption of the pre-existing stratification was much more extensive than previously proposed, and even the deepest water layers were involved in the event. This model is not intended to limit possible gas release mechanisms, and thus complete re-establishment of pre- 1986 water-column conditions is not a prerequisite for a future release. Spontaneous instability could occur at lake bottom in <20 yr if dissolved gas pressures continue to increase in this zone by 0.5-1 bar/yr as they have for the last 6 yr.

J	Hickman, M; Reasoner, MA				Hickman, M; Reasoner, MA			Late Quaternary diatom response to vegetation and climate change in a subalpine lake in Banff National Park, Alberta	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The late Quaternary diatom record from subalpine Crowfoot Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta (lat. 51 degrees 61'N; long. 116 degrees 31'W) has been analyzed. Results are related to independently inferred vegetation and climate changes. No diatoms were found in the basal diamict that predates 11 330 C-14 yr BP. Very few occur until ca. 10 100 C-14 yr BP probably due to the short time between de-glaciation and an advance of the Crowfoot Glacier during the 'Younger Dryas Chron'. Initial pioneering species were characteristic of alkaline water and calcareous organic sediments. They appeared as sediments became organic and laminated suggesting increasing water clarity, and as the Pinus-dominated forest expanded and the climate warmed. After ca. 9060 C-14 yr BP diatom numbers increased rapidly, reaching a maximum prior to the Mazama tephra; they remained high until ca. 3500 C-14 Yr BP. The period between ca. 9060 and 3500 C-14 yr saw timberline elevation increase and the dominance of xerophytic taxa. These are consistent with early to mid-Holocene warmth and aridity. Diatom productivity reflects the warm climate and presumably longer ice-free season, a stable catchment and transparent water. Decreases in diatom productivity coincide with a vegetation change with reduction of xerophytic taxa and the appearance of a closed Picea-Abies forest, hence a cooler, wetter climate at ca. 4100 to 3500 C-14 yr BP The diatom numbers during the Neoglacial were of the same magnitude as prior to ca. 9060 C-14 yr BP. Small species of Fragilaria (overwhelmingly Fragilaria construens v. venter) became extremely dominant during the period of high diatom productivity, and remained so thereafter. Recovery of the lake appears to have been rapid after deposition of the Mazama tephra. Maximum occurrence of Cyclotella radiosa occurred ca. 8000 C-14 Yr BP during the warm early Holocene and may reflect this warmer climate, a longer ice-free season than presently, perhaps less turbid water, or it may reflect a subtly higher nutrient status of the lake water. The diatom record of Crowfoot Lake has responded with sensitivity, particularly in terms of productivity, to the Holocene vegetation and climate changes.																			0921-2728					OCT	1998	20	3					253	265		10.1023/A:1007978730349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007978730349													WOS:000076951600005

Ingestion rates of rotifer species using 0.51 mu m microspheres or fluorescently labelled bacteria as tracers differed, with one exception. The ingestion rates depended on both the species and the tracer type. For cladocerans, fluorescently labelled bacteria seemed to underestimate grazing, presumably due to rapid digestion of tracer cells. Comparing results obtained with 0.51 mu m microspheres, rotifers were much more important grazers on bacteria than cladocerans in the study period (April-September). Based on microspheres, the rotifer populations with the highest uptake of bacteria were Filinia longiseta (May-July) and Anuraeopsis fissa (June-September). According to the uptake of fluorescently labelled bacteria, Conochilus unicornis had the highest uptake in June and A. fissa in July.

J	Gelda, RK; Effler, SW; Owens, EM				Gelda, RK; Effler, SW; Owens, EM			River dissolved oxygen model with zebra mussel oxygen demand (ZOD)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE												The development, calibration, and application of a dynamic two-dimensional mass balance model for dissolved oxygen (DO) for rivers are documented for the first time accommodating the oxygen demand associated with zebra mussels. The test system is a short (2.3 km) phytoplankton-rich section of the Seneca River, N.Y., which is believed to represent an upper bound of the impact of this exotic invader on oxygen resources because of the unusually high population densities and limited turbulent mixing that prevail. Model calibration is supported by comprehensive measurements of DO, which resolve diurnal and seasonal patterns, and various forcing conditions over a four-month period. Wide temporal variations in the areal consumption rate of DO by zebra mussels [zebra mussel oxygen demand (ZOD), g . m(-2) . day(-1)] were determined through model calibration. These determinations are supported by closure with earlier estimates based on simple DO budget calculations, and with laboratory biomass-specific oxygen consumption rates published in the scientific literature, Values of ZOD at times (e.g., > 50 g . m(-2) . day(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than the sediment oxygen demand associated with organically enriched deposits. The model performs well in simulating important features of the complex patterns of DO observed, including (1) DO depletion across the study section; (2) vertical DO stratification, and (3) diurnal changes. ZOD was the dominant sink for DO over the river study section; it was entirely responsible for the substantial observed DO depletion, and it was the major cause of the DO stratification during periods of low flow. A preliminary extension of the model is demonstrated to be successful in simulating the persistence of DO depletion 15 km downstream. The model is expected to have management utility for this and other phytoplankton-rich rivers that have been, or will be, invaded by zebra mussels.

The history of loading of Cl to the lake, extending from the mining of NaCl brines adjoining the lake in the late 1700s, through the 102 year period of operation and discharges of an adjoining soda ash/chlor-alkali facility, is reviewed. Loads are estimated for the 1973-1991 interval based on a program of continuous flow measurements and bi-weekly monitoring of Cl concentration for the major inflows. The model performs well in matching the substantial seasonal variations in lake Cl concentration and the major reduction in concentration observed since closure of the facility in 1986 (from about 1585 to 430 mg 1(-1)). Projections with the validated model demonstrate the C1 concentration in the lake would be about 230mgl(-1), nearly 50% lower than the present concentration, without the continuing waste input from the soda ash/chlor-alkali facility.																			0043-1354					APR	1994	28	4					849	861		10.1016/0043-1354(94)90091-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90091-4													WOS:A1994NA22700009

Cores were collected at overturn when a 2 cm thick layer of unconsolidation freshly recruited material was present at the sediment surface. Comparison with pore water measurements made on samples extracted using syringes agreed well above the interface and at 8 cm depth within the sediment. Differences at intermediate depths showed that the syringe-extraction procedure introduced artifacts due to mixing of pore waters with water overlying the sediment. There was evidence of small scale (<1 mm) microniche remobilisation of Fe and Mn within the freshly recruited sediment material. Potassium shows a sharp maxima at the interface, clearly separated from the zone of Fe and Mn resupply, and consistent with remobilisation due to decomposition of freshly recruited organic material. There was evidence of Mg mobilisation at the interface and at 1-2 cm depth where Fe and Mn release was occurring.

AH instars consumed rotifers (mainly Keratella cochlearis, Ploesoma sp., and Asplanchna priodonta), and instars III and IV fed preferentially on crustaceans (mainly bosminids and copepods). Phytoflagellates (Peridinium sp. and Dinobryon sp.), however, numerically dominated the diet of all instars examined (Ii-IV), and were consumed by instar II larvae in excess of their relative availability. On 40 and 20% of the sampling dates, instars III and IV, respectively, consumed phytoflagellates in accordance with their relative abundance in the lake. Although the contribution of phytoflagellates to the biomass-based diet of C. punctipennis was low, on one occasion phytoflagellates formed almost half of the diet biomass of instar II larvae. A review of the literature shows that in lakes where phytoflagellate densities are high (greater than or equal to 100-200/mL), phytoflagellates contribute greater than or equal to 50% of the diet biomass of all instars of Chaoborus spp. These findings indicate that Chaoborus spp. are omnivores that frequently feed on phytoflagellates even when alternative animal prey are abundant. Consumption of phagotrophic phytoflagellates by Chaoborus spp. and other large invertebrate omnivores, such as Mysis spp., Epischura spp., and cyclopoid copepods, may increase the transfer efficiency of organic carbon from the microbial food web to the upper trophic levels in fresh waters. In acidified lakes, consumption of large dinoflagellates by chaoborus spp. and other invertebrate omnivores may ameliorate the hypothesized bottleneck impeding the flow of carbon between phytoplankton and zooplankton.

To improve the water quality, sluice gates were operated to allow free exchange of water with the sea. The Shiwhaho, connected to the Yellow Sea through narrow gates, is affected mainly by wind forcing, flushing by gate operation and river flows, which are analyzed using seasonal field observations. As a predicting tool, a three-dimensional finite volume model CE-QUAL-ICM is incorporated into a finite element hydrodynamic model, TIDE3D. In coupling these two different modules, a new error minimization technique is applied by considering conservation of mass. Model tests for 1 year after calibration and validation show that eutrophication and other biological changes reach quasi-steady state after 60 days, thus, it would be necessary to consider moderate ramp up option to remove initial uncertainties. Sediment-water interaction might be neglected in the long-term simulation, since its effect is not a big concern. Simulated results show eutrophic processes in an estuarine lake and suggest some active circulation to improve water quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It comprises methodologies based on biomass size distributions, followed by food web analysis, network analysis and dynamic simulation models. The different approaches are compared with respect to data requirements, theoretical foundations, operational problems, time and computational effort, and the different types of information they provide on food web structure and dynamics. These ideas are illustrated with data from Lake Constance. Biomass size distributions provide a structural and energetic food web analysis based only on measurements of abundances and body sizes, and a few general assumptions mainly on size relationships of metabolic activities and trophodynamics. Food web analysis considers binary webs depicting qualitatively trophic links between species or trophic guilds and provides profound information about the food web structure. Mass-balanced flow diagrams (trophic webs) take into account the magnitude of flows between living and non-living compartments, and provide comprehensive descriptions of fluxes and cycling of matter and the trophic food web structure when evaluated by network analysis. These three static approaches are contrasted with tactical dynamic simulation models depicting interaction webs and representing unique possibilities of studying the dynamic nature, spatio-temporal organization, direct and indirect cause-effect relationships, and impact of physical forcing. However, these capabilities are only achievable on the expenditure of a very large research effort.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	1995	17	6					1273	1305		10.1093/plankt/17.6.1273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/17.6.1273													WOS:A1995RL65700007

Temporal and environmental factors	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The temporal distribution of aquatic insects in relation to habitat conditions was assessed in some northern Venezuelan Neotropical wetlands. The hypothesis that abiotic and biotic factors interacting in time may simultaneously explain the community structure of aquatic organisms was evaluated. Larval insects were sampled over a one-year period in five wetland types; 13 variables were quantified to describe each habitat. Partial redundancy analysis was used on. insect abundance data to partition the variance into four components: a) pure environmental variation without seasonal effect, b) seasonal variation of environmental factors, c) pure temporal factors (months), and d) unexplained variation. Our results showed that pure and temporally-structured environmental factors (a + b) explained between 30% and 58% of the variation of insect abundances within wetlands, whereas pure temporal factors also significantly contributed 13%-29% to variation in taxa abundance. Physical factors (rainfall and water depth), wetland trophic state (phytoplankton), and water chemistry (mainly CO2 and alkalinity) were significantly associated to community structure variability. We hypothesize that the interplay of trophic conditions, related chemical conditions, wetland duration, and insect life history patterns, all of which are mediated by seasonal fluctuation in rainfall, could largely account for the temporal. distribution of the insect taxa in these wetlands.

The mean deltaC-13 value of methane diffusing into collar-mounted flux chambers from wet meadow environments near Bethel, Alaska, was -65.82 +/- 2.21 parts per thousand (+/-1 sigma, n = 18) for the period July 10 to August 10, 1988. Detritus-rich sediments of Delta lakes, including margins of large lakes and entire submerged areas of smaller ones, are laden with gas bubbles whose methane concentration ranges from 11% to 79%. Lowest methane concentrations are found along heavily vegetated lake edge environments and highest throughout organic-rich, fibrous sediments of small lakes. A minimum ebullition flux estimated for the 5% of total Delta area comprised of small lakes ranges from 0.34 to 9.7 x 10(10) g CH4 yr-1 which represents 0.6% to 17% of the total Delta methane emission. The deltaC-13 and deltaD values of this ebullitive flux are -61.41 +/- 2.46 parts per thousand (n = 38) and -341.8 +/- 18.2 parts per thousand (n = 21), respectively. The methane in gas bubbles from two lakes is of modem, bomb carbon enriched, radiocarbon age. Gas bubble deltaC-13 values varied from 2 to 5 parts per thousand seasonally, reaching heaviest values in midsummer; no such variations in deltaD values were observed. Combined isotope data reveal that higher deltaC-13 values in heavily vegetated areas correlate with lower deltaD values, suggesting enhanced methane production via acetate fermentation. Spatial isotopic variations in lakes appear to be controlled by variations in production rather than oxidation processes.

Fourty three taxonomic groups were recorded. Oligochaetes, molluscs and dipteran larvae were the most abundant and widely distributed groups. The dominant oligochaetes were Bronchiura sowerbyii Beddard and the swamp worm Alma emini Michaelsen, which wore abundant in all silty and soft mud areas in both littoral and open water zones. Melanoides tuberculata Muller, Bellamya unicolor Olivier and Caelatura spp. were the most abundant molluscs. Different patterns were observed between near-littoral stations (<8 in deep) and deep water stations (8-40 m deep). After 10 years (1994), the macroinvertebrates of Lake Victoria were examined again. No evidence was found of seasonal changes in the composition or benthos density, although local changes occurred in some species which were attributed to swarming behaviour or larval settlement patterns. The spatial distribution of the fauna may be influenced primarily by oxygen availability and industrial effluent discharged from paper mill and agro-based industries in the catchment of the take. There has been a shift in abundance, from an Oligochaeta and Insecta dominated community in 1984, to the present community dominated by Mollusca and Oligochaeta. The ecological role of the benthic community and its recent changes to fisheries production in the lake is discussed.																			0018-8158					AUG 15	2001	458						83	90		10.1023/A:1013184128681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013184128681													WOS:000173248500010

We use a weighting function for past season counts that is different from, but nests, the standard on-site correction appropriate for current season counts. We find that for our sample of lake visitors relatively stronger preference or "avidity" for the interview site carries over across seasons. We further show that the appropriate weighting of past trip counts is critical in deriving meaningful estimates of travel demand and economic benefits. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Site characterization using solar Hα images	SOLAR PHYSICS												A Multi-Application Solar Telescope (MAST) is proposed to be installed at the lake site (Lake Fatehsagar) of Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) in India. The lake site Observatory of USO is located on a small island in the middle of the lake. To determine the optimum size of the MAST (for use with an adaptive optics system), it was decided to quantify the seeing conditions prevailing at the lake site during the different months of the year. For this purpose, we have used short-exposure (3 ms) high-resolution H alpha (6563 angstrom) images (spatial scale of similar to 0.55 arc sec per pixel) of the Sun taken in burst mode with the 15-cm refractor Spar telescope located at the lake site of USO. Spectral ratio technique as reported by von der Luhe (1984, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A1, 510) has been used to estimate the Fried's parameter (r(0)) at this site, which gives the quantitative measure of astronomical seeing. This study has been carried out daily on an hourly basis during 4:30-10:30 UT over the months January-June of the years 2005 and 2006 to understand the diurnal and seasonal variations in r (0) at this site. It is noteworthy that the lake was almost dry during the observing period in 2005, while it overflowed during our observations in 2006 because of abundant monsoon rains. The seeing in the presence of water shows improvement in r (0) by about 1.0 cm with respect to the previous year's dry condition and mean r (0) varies between 4.0 and 4.5 cm as evident from the data obtained between January and June, 2006.																			0038-0938					APR	2007	241	2					427	437		10.1007/s11207-007-0387-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11207-007-0387-3													WOS:000247458200016

Pair formation took place in May at Tritiva and in June at Tsimanampetsotsa. Mating periods spanned 75 days in the south-west and 43 days on the central plateau. Eggs were laid during July on the high plateau and in August in the south-west. The incubation period at the two nests was 33 and 35 days, respectively. Five young hatched in two nests, three on the central plateau in August and a minimum of two in the south-west in September. Two young fledged successfully at 42 days of age at the south-west nest and the three young at the high plateau succumbed to unknown causes. The two fledged young dispersed at 64 days of age. The Peregrine Falcon diet in Madagascar varied between the two sites: in the south-west 100% (n = 353 birds; 19 species) of identified prey was composed of native birds and 99% (n = 94; 2 species) of identified prey at the central plateau site was almost exclusively domestic chickens Gallus gallus.																			0030-6525					APR	2007	78	1					7	12		10.2989/OSTRICH.2007.78.1.2.46	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/OSTRICH.2007.78.1.2.46													WOS:000246698600002

Sockeye salmon migrated approximately 1 week earlier than pink salmon and spawned 250-350 m upstream from pink salmon. Habitat overlap measured with proportional similarity index monotonically increased with increasing spawner densities. Multidimensional niche spaces measured with water depth, current velocity, and channel gradient at redds were significantly different between pink and sockeye salmon (P < 0.005, Hotelling's T-2-test). However, classification of the redds into individual species was subjected to large error rates; 33% of 70 pink salmon redds and 34% of 125 sockeye salmon redds were misclassified.

In the most turbid region of the lake, Secchi transparency averaged 0.2 m and the vertical light (PAR) attenuation coefficient (eta") averaged 9.7 m-1; in the least turbid region, Secchi transparency averaged 0.7 m (eta" averaged 2.3 m-1). Phytoplankton at the shallowest and most turbid station were most productive per unit volume, while the least turbid station, with a deep circulating water column, had the lowest volume-based production. There was a considerable rainy vs. dry season difference in water transparency and in production. The lake became less turbid during the rainy season due to increased depth and lessened sediment resuspension. The annual lakewide production C.V. was 34% with the greatest day-to-day variation during the rainy season. Phytoplankton Chl a averaged 5.4 mg m-3 of the mixed water column for all regions. Chl a at the shallowest and most turbid station averaged almost twice that of the other stations. Chl a increased through the rainy season (as transparency and inorganic N content increased). Variation in inorganic N accounted for the greatest variation in Chl a at each region.																			0024-3590					MAY	1992	37	3					549	565		10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0549	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0549													WOS:A1992JH23500008

The origin of these fluctuations has been obscure. Results reported here from a modeling study suggest that such a response can occur over low-latitude land areas involved in monsoon fluctuations. The twice yearly passage of the sun across the equator and the seasonal timing of perihelion interact to increase both 100-ky and 400-ky power in the modeled temperature field. The magnitude of the temperature response is sufficiently large to leave an imprint on the geologic record, and simulated fluctuations resemble those found in records of Triassic lake levels.																			0036-8075	1095-9203				FEB 7	1992	255	5045					705	707		10.1126/science.255.5045.705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.255.5045.705								17756950					WOS:A1992HC50600034

A total of 86 taxa were determined, and Cymbella minuta, Pinnularia maior and Surirella splendida were the most conspicuous algae, regarding frequency of occurrence and relative abundance in the benthic algal flora. While the highest density of the epipelic community was found to be 12079 cells/cm(2) at station I in October 2001, the lowest density was 5911 cells/ cm(2) at station II in September 2002. The highest Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H-1) in the epipelic flora was found to be 2.979 at station I in July 2002. Considerable differences were observed between the two stations in the seasonal fluctuations of total cell numbers and diversity index. In this study, ice, light and water temperatures were found to be more important factors in regulating the growth of benthic algal flora in Karanlik Lake, which is according with that of oligotrophic high mountain lakes of the Northern hemisphere.					; akar, bülent/KWU-3325-2024; ŞAHİN, Bülent/AAG-5538-2019	AKAR, BULENT/0000-0002-1421-374X; 													1018-4619	1610-2304					2006	15	1					48	54																WOS:000235286000008
J	Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Rojo, C; Velasco, JL; Baltanás, A				Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Rojo, C; Velasco, JL; Baltanás, A			Factors controlling planktonic size spectral responses to autumnal circulation in a Mediterranean lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Studies of planktonic size spectra have been common in recent years, but few concerning the effects of autumnal lake processes on those distributions have been reported. We carried out such a study for 93 days during early circulation in a small, mesotrophic, seepage lake with only benthivorous fish. Two distinct mixing periods occurred before full circulation in Las Madres lake (Spain). As a proxy of overall planktonic- and phytoplanktonic size distributions, the shape of a Pareto I power function was traced over time. The phytoplanktonic size spectrum was also used to test the hypothesis that phytoplankton might show a trophic cascade during early circulation. 2. Our results demonstrated that the overall size spectrum changed smoothly during the autumnal mixing, with sequential changes controlled by a combination of biotic and abiotic variables, albeit experiencing different temporal delays, always shorter than a week. A first combined, autogenic process, driven both by algal competition and a crustacean trophic effect, and a second physical-forcing process, driven by the combined effect of convective cooling and decreasing irradiance on mixed layer dynamics, may be related to the overall planktonic spectrum in the first and second periods of mixing, respectively. 3. The phytoplanktonic size spectrum did not appear to be dictated by a trophic cascade in Las Madres lake, their dynamics being mostly controlled by physical forcing, along with some effect of non-edible primary producers and cladocerans in the first and second periods of mixing, respectively. 4. Our results and others covering early circulation with longer sampling periods suggest that planktonic size spectral dynamics during lake circulation is context-dependent (i.e. varying from one lake to another), thus preventing generalisation. However, when further studies with finer temporal resolution have been carried out, it is likely that clear-cut patterns in the planktonic size spectrum will emerge, arising from the interplay of autogenic plankton dynamics, implying some resistance to community change because of external physical forcing, and the velocity of autumnal mixing.

Taxonomic identification was done by using common methods and keys. The vegetation of the reservoir created by damming the river water was studied on the basis of phytosociological records, and the plankton was investigated on the basis of research made at three dates of the vegetation season at sites located upstream and downstream of the dam. In the water reservoir, numerous macrophyte associations of well - developed structure were found to occur. The reservoir itself is also attractive for plankton communities. Among algal groups, Bacillariophyceae account for the largest proportion of the whole algal plankton community. Due to their intensive development and distinct domination, the proportion of the other groups of algae is small. The species compositions and taxonomic structures of the phytoplankton living upstream and downstream of the dam are rather similar, differences concern only the forms in which some species occur. Namely, the colonies of Stephanodiscus downstream of the water turbine are disintegrated, and the coenobia of Pediastrum are deformed and fragmented. The damage is mechanical in nature and is done when water flows through the turbine. Upstream of the dam, in shallow, fertile and sunlit areas, large patches of Enteromorpha intestinalis f. maxima have developed. The zooplankton is dominated by Rotatoria. Among others, some rare, thermophilous species of Rotatoria, typical of warm, shallow, extremely fertile water bodies, occur in the water reservoir. The size of Protozoa community in the water environment downstream of the dam is higher than upstream of it.

POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY					4th Symposium for European Freshwater Science (SEFS 4)	AUG, 2005	Jagiellonian Univ, Cracow, POLAND		Jagiellonian Univ			In lakes, chaoborids can be a food resource and also act as competitors for planktivorous fish. Usually their density varies reciprocally with the density of planktivorous fish, which forage on chaoborids. Results from Lake Hiidenvesi show, however, that in deep clay-turbid lakes chaoborids may be the main regulators of herbivorous zooplankton although the density of planktivorous fish is high. This is because turbidity reduces the feeding efficiency of fish while the feeding of chaoborids is not affected by the high turbidity levels.																			1505-2249						2006	54	4					701	707																WOS:000243236300016

From March 2004 to January 2006 we studied the ecology and reproductive biology of two sympatric species of Aplastodiscus in three different habitats: lake, stream, and swamp. The majority of A. leucopygius males in calling activity were recorded during the rainy season and during sporadic rains in the dry season (April to September). The same was observed for A. arildae. Most courtship displays of A. leucopygius were observed mainly during the rainy period and only one courtship behaviour was observed for A. arildae during a rainy night, in December 2005. Aplastodiscus leucopygius males were found in activity in the three habitats surveyed. In contrast, males of A. arildae were found in only one habitat (stream).

The model predicts that juvenile B. cederstroemi will consume approximately 150% of their body weight per day, while adults consume 118% of their body weight per day. These rates are consistent with those of other invertebrate crustaceans. The predicted rate was twice that of an experimental measurement reported for Lake Huron B. cederstroemi; this discrepancy is attributed to experimental artifacts and to differences between B. cederstroemi populations in Lake Michigan and those in Lakes Huron and Erie. The model was most sensitive to estimation of ingestion and assimilation efficiencies and, secondarily, respiration coefficients. This model estimates the consumption rate of B. cederstroemi in Lake Michigan under optimal food resource conditions, and may be useful in predicting the future impact of B. cederstroemi predation on the zooplankton assemblages of other lakes.

In addition to such measurements, these systems also have the capability to detect discrete targets, such as ships. This paper illustrates measurements made with both systems for the purpose of ship detection on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Radar data collected over Lake Michigan also indicates, for the first time, the potential that exists to detect ships with HF radar over freshwater lakes. Actual backscatter data collected from vessels of opportunity are shown to be consistent with theoretical considerations for the maximum ranges attainable for ship detection for both CODAR SeaSonde and MCR systems. Estimates of ship radar cross-section are also consistent with experimental values obtained Methods such as signal stationarity; frequency, diversity and peak tracking aid in separating ships from other targets and from noise sources within echoes received from both types of radar systems.																			1712-7971					AUG	2001	27	4					277	290		10.1080/07038992.2001.10854871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2001.10854871													WOS:000172768100002

Migration patterns and home range of pike-perch (Sander lucioperca, Linnaeus, 1758) in Dutch river systems	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Pike-perch (Sander lucioperca L. 1758) is one of the freshwater species caught by professional fishermen in the Netherlands. The species is also popular with sport fishermen. Little is known about its migration and rehabilitation in large river systems. The aim of the present study was to obtain data on the movements of pike-perch in the Dutch large river systems and investigate when and how far individual fish swim up- or downstream. Seasonal migration was expected. The second objective was to gain information on how many fish pass the Haringvlietdam when migrating downstream during high discharge, and ending up in the North Sea. The third objective was to gain data on how many fish were caught by the fishermen. NEDAP TRAIL System (R) transponders were surgically implanted in 286 pike-perch between June 2007 and October 2008. Marked fish could be detected via several detection stations in the river systems throughout the Netherlands and one in the River Rhine station in Germany. Sport fishermen were asked to inform the organization when a marked fish was caught. Data collected between June 2007 and April 2010 indicate a pike-perch home range of 30-40km, with some individuals migrating up to more than 200km. A regional approach regarding fisheries management is necessary. No seasonal patterns were found. Swimming activity was highest during darkness. Results showed pike-perch around the Haringvlietdam swimming in the saltwater area on the sea side of the dam, and returning to the freshwater Lake Haringvliet, indicating that the structure of the dam is used for feeding, but also that the fish will die if the dam is closed when fish are still outside.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				OCT	2017	33	5					907	913		10.1111/jai.13390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13390													WOS:000409474200005

We investigated the influence of fire frequency on woody vegetation structure and composition across different fire frequency classes in Lake Chivero Recreational Park (LCRP), northern Zimbabwe. Using a 25 year fire history, we stratified the study area into the following three fire frequency classes: high (every 1-2 years), medium (every 3-4 years) and low (every 5-6 years). Data were collected from a total of 15 plots (five plots per stratum) measuring 20 m x 60 m between April and May 2014. The following variables were recorded in each plot: species name, plant height, and number of woody plants. A total of 37 woody plant species comprising 1,208 individual plants (59% trees and 41% shrubs) were recorded across the three fire frequency strata. Our results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in woody plant height with the low fire frequency stratum having the tallest woody plants whereas the high fire frequency stratum had the shortest woody plants. Tree density was highest in the medium fire frequency stratum and lowest in high fire frequency stratum whilst shrub density was highest in the low fire frequency stratum and lowest in the high fire frequency stratum (both, P < 0.05). In contrast, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were recorded for woody plant evenness and species diversity across the three fire frequency strata. We recommend for the development of a robust fire management plan for LCRP encompassing patch mosaic and early burning as strategies of minimizing fire impacts on sensitive habitats.					; Gandiwa, Edson/I-2925-2019	Gandiwa, Edson/0000-0003-0708-350X; 													0564-3295	2661-8982				OCT	2017	58	3					583	589																WOS:000422760500011
J	Kankaala, P; Ojala, A; Tulonen, T; Arvola, L				Kankaala, P; Ojala, A; Tulonen, T; Arvola, L			Changes in nutrient retention capacity of boreal aquatic ecosystems under climate warming: a simulation study	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Loading, retention and release of nitrogen and phosphorus were studied for three growing seasons in experimental flow-through pond ecosystems, where impacts of rising temperature on the boreal zone were studied; one pond was under ambient temperature conditions and another was enclosed in a greenhouse with air temperature 2-3 degreesC higher than ambient. The ponds received a high load of nitrogen (14-18 g N m(-2) in June-October) and a moderate load of phosphorus (0.2 g P m(-2)) from the nearby mesohumic Lake Paajarvi. During the growing seasons, the ponds retained inorganic nitrogen (NO3-N), and the retention improved in the course of the experiment from 29% to 76% in the greenhouse pond and from 33% to 76% in the reference pond. For total nitrogen (totN), the retention was, however, lower (15-22% in the greenhouse pond and 16-33% in the reference pond). The ponds acted more as sources than sinks for P; with the exception of the greenhouse pond during the first growing season more P was released from than retained in the ponds. During the second and third growing seasons, the release of P exceeded the load of P in the inflow by 65% and 72% in the greenhouse pond and to a lesser extent (by 49% and 32%, respectively) in the reference pond. This was likely due to uptake of P by macrophytes from the sediment, and P released from decaying plants was later utilized by littoral algal communities. In a warmer climate, the uptake of P by macrophytes from sediment may be an important accelerator of eutrophication of lakes in the boreal zone.

J	Bell, VA; Elliott, JM; Moore, RJ				Bell, VA; Elliott, JM; Moore, RJ			Modelling the effects of drought on the population of brown trout in Black Brows Beck	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Records from a 30-year study of the population of migratory brown trout, Salmo trutta L., in Black Brews Beck (English Lake District) are used to construct a model for predicting population numbers during normal rainfall conditions and under the influence of drought. Twice-yearly samples of different age-groups of trout were recorded, together with a more detailed set of records for a further 8 years. These data are used to develop and calibrate a time-dependent population model. A concurrent record of rainfall data for Windermere is aggregated to form seasonal averages and used as an indicator of drought for the region. Drought conditions result in lower than expected stock which can be identified as outliers from the Ricker stock-recruitment curves for each sample. A set of five difference equations, which describe the overlapping trout age-groups, is identified and used to forecast the trout population up to a few years ahead. The model is particularly successful at forecasting population numbers 1-year ahead if the following years drought is taken into account. Incorporation of drought effects into the model significantly improves model forecasts. A linearised stability analysis suggests that long-term drought conditions will have the effect of increasing population stability, although a particularly severe drought, or series of severe droughts, may lead to population decline.

J	Retelle, MJ; Child, JK				Retelle, MJ; Child, JK			Suspended sediment transport and deposition in a high arctic meromictic lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A study of sedimentary processes and sediment yields in a high arctic meromictic lake (Lake C2, Taconite Inlet, northern Ellesemere Island, Canada) was undertaken from May 1990 through August 1992 to understand the links between climatic controls, hydrology, and the laminated sediment record preserved in the lake. Understanding the relationships between processes and the sediment record is critical for interpreting the climatic significance of the laminated sediments in a region where high resolution climate proxy records are quite limited. Sediment transport to Lake C2 is dominated by fluvial processes. During the early part of the melt season slushflows transport sediment to the lake surface. Subsequently, suspended sediment is delivered to the lake by the main inlet stream and distributed lakeward by a plume emanating the main inlet channel. Due to the strong density stratification of the water column the plume distributes sediment downlake by overflows and interflows in the epilimnion. In general, overflows are generated by lower discharge events whereas interflows penetrate to the halocline during high discharge with increased suspended sediment concentration. Sediment trap analysis demonstrates that suspended sediment transport and deposition responds to diurnal through annual changes in stream discharge. Seasonal and annual sediment trap yields agree with average accumulation rates determined from varve thickness measurements and cumulative suspended sediment discharge from the main inlet stream indicating a close link between climatological, hydrological, and sedimentological controls and varve deposition.																			0921-2728					SEP	1996	16	2					151	167																WOS:A1996VG04200004
J	Liu, PWG; Johnson, R				Liu, PWG; Johnson, R			Forecasting peak daily ozone levels - I. A regression with time series errors model having a principal component trigger to fit 1991 ozone levels	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												This research was motivated by the need to warn the population of Milwaukee, WI, on high-ozone days. A statistical model for the peak daily 1-hr ozone level is proposed. A Regression with Time Series Errors (RTSE) model, which includes a principal component (PC) trigger, is the basis for forecasting the peak daily 1-hr ozone level. The RTSE model, with a PC trigger, is first employed to estimate daily peak ozone measured at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee-North (UWM-N), during the 1991 ozone season. The RTSE model uses peak daily temperature, morning vector average wind direction, and the PC trigger as predictor variables. The PC trigger was designed to summarize atmospheric circumstances when peak ozone was greater than 100 parts per billion (ppb). It is verified that the RTSE model, with a PC trigger, significantly improves the prediction of peak daily ozone, particularly peak ozone greater than 100 ppb. In comparison with the RTSE model without the PC trigger, the RTSE model with a PC trigger raised the R-2 from 0.680 to 0.809.(1) It is suggested that the RTSE model, with the PC trigger, is an adequate statistical model that has the potential for real-time ozone forecasting.																			1047-3289					SEP	2002	52	9					1064	1074		10.1080/10473289.2002.10470841	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10473289.2002.10470841								12269667					WOS:000177933800008

Frequency of nest visits by investigators did not influence predation rates. Nest predation increased as the breeding season progressed and occurred most often during daylight hours. When seasonal effects were held constant, nestlings were depredated more often than eggs, and young nestlings were depredated more often than old nestlings. Several lines of evidence indicated that, for Florida Scrub Jays, diurnal snakes and birds were the most important nest predators, while nocturnal mammals were relatively less important. Late in the breeding season, pairs with helpers experienced less nest predation than pairs without helpers. This effect was primarily the result of reduced predation on nestlings.

J	Xiong, SY; Xiong, ZX; Wang, PW				Xiong, SY; Xiong, ZX; Wang, PW			Soil salinity in the irrigated area of the yellow river in Ningxia, China	ARID SOIL RESEARCH AND REHABILITATION												Soil salinity has plagued irrigated lands along the Yellow River in the arid Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China since shortly after the first canal was built in BC 214. By 1985, approximately 40% of the 300,000 ha of irrigated land was adversely affected by salt accumulation. Several factors have contributed to the increase in salinity. They include high groundwater tables caused by overirrigation, leaky main and lateral canals, and an inadequate drainage system. Other factors are the flatness of the terrain, the high level of the Yellow River during the flood season, widespread production of paddy rice, introduction of fish ponds, and the presence of numerous lakes in the Yinchuan Plain. Effective methods of rehabilitating salt-affected land have been devised but are not yet in wide use. Sediment from the highly eroded Loess Plateau complicates water control in the irrigation system. Despite the salinity problem, irrigation agriculture has prospered over the past 2,000 years.																			0890-3069					JAN-MAR	1996	10	1					95	101																WOS:A1996UD89000009

The integrated management system being developed at Harrow in S.W. Ontario reduced herbicide input 50% by banding the chemical over the seed row. Runoff events close to herbicide application contained high concentrations of atrazine, metribuzin and metolachlor. However, the volume of runoff was low during the 1991 growing season, therefore herbicide loss was low (<2% of applied). The three herbicides rapidly dissipated in the soil so that subsequent runoff events transported little herbicide in the runoff water. The total quantity of de-ethyl atrazine loss was lower from soil saver than moldboard plow. No water table control or intercrop effects were found in 1991 for herbicide loss because of the drought. Tile drainage resulted in a greater volume of water and loss of NO-3 than with surface runoff. Consequently, over 97% of the total NO-3 loss occurred through tile drainage. The flow weighted NO-3 Concentration in tile drainage water was 22.5 mg N L-1 for the drainage treatments and 15.1 mg N L-1 for the water table control treatments from Nov. 1, 1991 till April 30, 1992. During this time period, NO-3 loss through tile drainage was 57.8 kg N ha-1 from the drainage treatments and 36.3 kg N ha-1 from the water table control treatments. Therefore, the water table control treatment reduced the flow weighted NO-3 concentration in file drainage water by 33% and total NO-3 loss by 37%. The water table control treatments combined with soil saver tillage resulted in lower concentrations and losses of NO-3 than with any other treatments.

A new Fuzzy-LOGIC based Model for Chlorophyll-a in Pulicat Lagoon, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Coastal lagoons are complex ecosystems exhibiting a high degree of non-linearity in the distribution and exchange of nutrients dissolved in the water column due to their spatio-temporal characteristics. This factor has a direct influence on the concentrations of chlorophyll-a, an indicator of the primary productivity in the water bodies as lakes and lagoons. Moreover the seasonal variability in the characteristics of large-scale basins further contributes to the uncertainties in the data on the physico-chemical and biological characteristics of the lagoons. Considering the above, modelling the distributions of the nutrients with respect to the chlorophyll-concentrations, hence requires an effective approach which will appropriately account for the non-linearity of the ecosystem as well as the uncertainties in the available data. In the present investigation, fuzzy logic was used to develop a new model of the primary production for Pulicat lagoon, Southeast coast of India. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the lagoon was highly influenced by the dissolved concentrations of nitrate, nitrites and phosphorous to different extents over different seasons and years. A high degree of agreement was obtained between the actual field values and those predicted by the new fuzzy model (d = 0.881 to 0.788) for the years 2005 and 2006, illustrating the efficiency of the model in predicting the values of chlorophyll-a in the lagoon.

J	Yao, YH; Li, HG				Yao, YongHui; Li, HuiGuo			Tectonic geomorphological characteristics for evolution of the Manas Lake	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Owing to global climatic changes and human activities, the lakes have changed dramatically in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang in recent 50 years. Based on the remote sensing images from Beijing Satellite No.1 in 2006 together with the measured topographical data in 1999 and other data since the 1950s, this paper analyzes mainly the features of landforms around the Manas Lake and the changes of feeding sources of the lake. The results are as follows: (1) Tectonic movement brought about the fundamental geomorphological basis for lacustrine evolution, and the Manas Lake is one of small lakes broken up from the Old Manas Lake due to tectonic movement and drought climate; the Manas Lake had existed before the Manas River flowed into it in 1915. The geomorphologic evidences for evolution of the Manas Lake include: (a) Diluvial fans and old channels at the north of the lake indicate that the rivers originating from the north mountains of the Junggar Basin had fed the Old Manas Lake and now still feed the lake as seasonal rivers; (b) The Old Manas Lake was fed by many rivers originating from the mountains, except for the Manas River, from the evidence of small lakes around the Manas Lake, old channels, alluvial fans, etc.; (c) The elevations of the alluvial and diluvial fans are near to the 280 m a.s.l. and all of the small lakes and lacustrine plains are within the range of the 280 m a.s.l., which may prove that the elevation of the Old Manas Lake was about 280 m a.s.l.; (d) Core analysis of the Manas Lake area also indicates that the Manas Lake has existed since Late Pleistocene epoch. (2) Analysis on the feeding relations between the lakes and the lacustrine evolution shows that human activities are one of main driving forces of the lacustrine evolution in recent 50 years, and it is the precondition of restoring and maintaining the lacutrine wetlands in the study area to satisfy the feeding of the Baiyang and Manas rivers to the Manas Lake.																			1674-6767					SEP	2010	2	3					167	173		10.3724/SP.J.1227.2010.00167	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1227.2010.00167													WOS:000293495800002

Home-range estimations have generally been disregarded as a means of quantifying habitat use and availability. Seasonal habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) calculated from a home-range estimator using an adaptive kernel method was compared with relocation point data from Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, South Dakota from 1 January 1993 to 27 June 1994, to determine if an adaptive kernel home-range estimator approximates traditional methods of quantifying habitat use. No differences between proportional area of seasonal home-ranges and point data were detected (P > 0.05), indicating that habitat use calculated from an adaptive kernel home-range estimate was similar to habitat use calculated from relocation points. Potential benefits of home-range estimations include consideration of radio-telemetry error biological independence of observations, and complete utilisation distributions. Given the success of home-range estimators at quantifying habitat use, a new alternative to habitat use analysis is offered. In situations where inherent telemetry error is unavoidable, using proportional area of home-range contours to define habitat use avoids the pitfalls associated with telemetry relocation point data.

Diatom responses to late Quaternary vegetation and climate change, and to deposition of two tephras in an alpine and a sub-alpine lake in Yoho National Park, British Columbia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The late Quaternary diatom records from alpine Opabin Lake (altitude 2285 m a.s.l.) and sub-alpine Mary Lake (altitude 2054 m a.s.l.), located in Yoho National Park, British Columbia (lat. 51 degrees 21'N; long. 116 degrees 20'), have been analyzed, and changes in these records have been used to reconstruct lake histories. The results have also been related to independently inferred vegetation and climate changes. Following deglaciation, when both lakes were receiving high inputs of clastic materials, benthic diatom taxa dominate the records of these two shallow lakes with small species of Fragilaria being particularly prominent. During the early to mid-Holocene period, when treeline was at a higher elevation than today, the diatom flora of both lakes became more diverse with previously minor species becoming more prominent. Cyclotella radiosa occurs in cores from both Mary Lake, and much deeper, neighbouring Lake O'Hara during the warm early Holocene, and may reflect this warmer climate, a longer ice-free season than presently, and perhaps less turbid water, or its presence may reflect a subtly higher nutrient status of the lake water during this period. The Neoglacial is marked by increased amounts of sediments originating from glacial sources in Opabin Lake, which undoubtedly led to very turbid water, and by the presence of Ellerbeckia arenaria f. teres and Campylodiscus noricus v. hibernica in Opabin Lake; however, these species are absent from Mary Lake which has not been influenced by either glacial activity since the recession of the glaciers prior to c. 10 000 years BP or water originating from Opabin Lake. The impact of the two tephras during the Holocene was dramatic in terms of increased diatom production, as exemplified by the increases in diatom numbers, but there was little effect upon species composition. The diatom records and changes in the diatom: cyst ratio suggest that the chemical status of these two small, shallow lakes has changed little during the Holocene, other than after deposition of the two tephras. These results provide evidence that shallow alpine and high sub-alpine lakes are sensitive recorders of past environmental changes,																			0921-2728					JAN	1994	11	2					173	188		10.1007/BF00686864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00686864													WOS:000208333700003
J	HOWARD, DE; EVANS, RD				HOWARD, DE; EVANS, RD			ACID-VOLATILE SULFIDE (AVS) IN A SEASONALLY ANOXIC MESOTROPHIC LAKE - SEASONAL AND SPATIAL CHANGES IN SEDIMENT AVS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) is an operational definition for the sulfides removed from sediment by cold acid extraction. It has been proposed that this fraction could be used as an indicator of divalent metal toxicity (e.g., Cd, Ni, Hg), as it increases the metal-binding capacity of sediments and hence renders metals unavailable to biota. Before AVS can be used as a predictive tool in freshwater systems, we must develop a better understanding of the impact of seasonal turnover events on its geochemistry. An in-depth study of spatial and temporal variation in AVS concentrations in a seasonally anoxic mesotrophic lake is presented. Comparisons are made to AVS in other lakes, with reference to its utilization as a sediment toxicity parameter. Results indicate that AVS increases during anoxic periods and that lake morphology is important due to sediment focusing. Seasonal variations in AVS concentration were observed that may change the potential toxicity of metals in freshwater sediments.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				JUN	1993	12	6					1051	1057		10.1002/etc.5620120611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620120611													WOS:A1993LD03400011

It is based on a multidisciplinary approach using numerous techniques. The chronological framework is established on the basis of 2314C dates (on inorganic calcite and mollusc shells) ranging from ca 9300 to 3000 yr B.P. (and on an isolated 14C age of ca 10,900 yr B.P.). The significance of various environmental markers is discussed. Biological remains are abundant and diversified (about 150 taxa including diatoms, chrysophytes, charophytes, ostracods, molluscs and foraminifera). They provide information on the water chemistry (total salinity, ionic ratio, pH, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and on the habitats (water depth, development of aquatic plants, ephemerality, etc). Emphasis is given to the total salinity. Individual organisms and palaeobiological assemblages are ordered as a function of their salt requirements and tolerances. Calibration based on modern diatom samples allows a tentative estimate of the palaeosalinities which range from fresh to marine-like, and even hypersaline waters. Attention is drawn to the possible colonization of "marine" organisms in continental basins without any connection with the sea. Stable isotope analyses have been carried out on both inorganic and biogenic (mollusc and ostracod shells, charophyte gyrogonites) carbonates. The 18O contents demonstrate wide changes in the hydrological balance. Fluctuations in 13C contents inform on water mixing, residence time, and on the importance of biological effects on total dissolved inorganic carbon. Geochemical analyses were performed on organic calcite and on ostracod shells. High contents in Fe and Mn indicate reducing environments during stages of high salinity. Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca are used as salinity indicators. Zn/Mg ratios suggest that the major water supply was the aquifer of the Great Western Erg, today down to about - 50 m, rather than surface waters from the Atlas mountains. Salinities resulted from the balance between inputs from the water-table, evaporation rate, leaching of pre-existing salt crusts, and seepage through the lake bottom. A reconstruction of the evolution of the palaeosystems through time and space has been attempted, with special attention to the instability of the water and ionic balances for different time scales. Short term fluctuations occurring during a single hydrological cycle (annual or seasonal) are deduced from the apparent discrepancies between the various indicators found in a given sample. Long term (102 - 103 years) changes confirm the existence of a climatic phase being wetter than today from at least ca 9300 (and may be from ca 10,900 yr B.P) to 3,000 yr B.P. For the first time, the salinity deduced from diatoms and the 18O content of the water deduced from that of the carbonate (at 25.degree. C) are used simultaneously to model the hydrological history of the basins and to estimate the relative humidity of the atmosphere during the Holocene. Major environmental trends recorded from ca 9300 to 3000 yr B.P. do not show a clear synchronism between the different profiles studied. Therefore, they cannot be interpreted in terms of palaeoclimate, but instead demonstrate the importance of local hydrology in the evolution of closed basins associated with groundwater, a common situation in arid and semi-arid zones.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL	1987	60	1-2					1	46		10.1016/0031-0182(87)90022-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(87)90022-8													WOS:A1987J744000001

Spatial and temporal trends of gas and particle phase atmospheric DDT and metabolites in Michigan: Evidence of long-term persistence and atmospheric emission in a high-DDT-use fruit orchard	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Michigan was among the top three apple producing states in the United States from the 1940s to 1969 when DDT was heavily used on its fruit orchards. More than 2 decades after Michigan banned DDT use in 1969, we collected air samples from four sites around the state to measure concentrations of six DDT-related compounds in the atmosphere. At South Haven, an apple producing area, average gas phase concentrations of DDT and DDE compounds were at least 10 times greater than the other sites including Pellston in the north, Deckerville in the east, and Dexter in south-central. Concentrations at South Haven showed a very strong seasonal cycle, an effect of higher air temperatures on moving these residues into the gas phase from a local source. We calculated DH values for all six compounds from the South Haven data which showed that p,p'-DDE was the highest at 108 kJ mol(-1). The DH values for all compounds at South Haven had a high correlation with Henry's Law Constant (HLC) (r = 0.7), verifying that HLC is a good indicator of tendency for compound conversion to the gas phase. South Haven was the only site with significant atmospheric particle-associated DDT. Particle/gas ratios there for p, p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE also had a predictable seasonal variation.

Blood from 111 known-age, adult Caspian terns (Sterna caspia) nesting in several regions of the upper Great Lakes was collected in 1990 to examine bio-availability of PCBs, to compare concentrations of PCBs among nesting locations, and to determine relationships between concentrations of PCBs and age, productivity, and colony site tenacity. PCBs, DDE, dieldrin, and trans-nonachlor were detected in all the samples. Concentrations of PCBs were, on average, 10, 100, and 250 times greater than those of DDE, dieldrin, and trans-nonachlor, respectively. Concentrations of PCBs were not correlated with age, and were greater in Caspian terns from Saginaw and Green Bays than in Caspian terns from the North Channel and Georgian Bay. Concentrations of PCBs and DDE were significantly correlated with one-another and their accumulation patterns were the most similar among all the chemicals studied. Patterns of organochlorines as determined by cluster analysis were most similar for the nearest nesting locations. The bioaccumulation of PCBs in Great Lakes Caspian terns appeared to be seasonal and did not vary with adult age. A significant negative correlation was observed between mean concentrations of PCBs by region and percent terns returning to natal region. Those populations which were likely to be affected by PCBs were those nesting in Green Bay and Saginaw Bay.

J	Hann, BJ; Goldsborough, LG				Hann, BJ; Goldsborough, LG			Responses of a prairie wetland to press and pulse additions of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus: invertebrate community structure and interactions	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Bottom-up experimental manipulation of a wetland food web via press or pulse nutrient additions in Delta Marsh, Canada, demonstrated a differential response among primary producers and associated invertebrate grazers. Microinvertebrate grazers, dominated by Ceriodaphnia dubia, effectively depressed phytoplankton biomass in control, press, and pulse enclosures in the absence of fish predators. Similarly, microinvertebrate grazers increased in density in response to increased availability of periphyton on acrylic rods in both press and pulse nutrient treatments. Subsequently, proliferation of inedible filamentous green algae, in part as a consequence of size-selective herbivory, especially with the press nutrrient additions, led to a marked decline in grazer density. Macrophyte-associated invertebrates, mainly chydorid cladocerans, increased in abundance in parallel with macrophyte biomass changes and reduced epiphyton biomass through most of the season. Metaphyton shading (primarily in the press treatment) led to macrophyte decline and eventual decomposition, and substantial reduction in phytophilous invertebrate density. These grazer-algal interactions support the hypothesis of top-down control by grazers on algae (phytoplankton and epiphyton) as a regulatory mechanism in macrophyte-dominated aquatic ecosystems. The transition from epiphyton-dominated to metaphyton-dominated wetland is shown to be facilitated by herbivory, nutrient addition, and continuous availability of nutrients.																			0003-9136					AUG	1997	140	2					169	194																WOS:A1997YB25300002

Amounts of precipitation received at the two sites were similar, but precipitation pH and air temperature, respectively, averaged 4.83 and 13.9 degrees C at the northern gradient site and 4.29 and 15.1 degrees C at the southern gradient site. Volume weighted DOC concentrations in throughfall were significantly greater at the northern (20.5 mg L(-1)) than the southern (15.9 mg L(-1)) site, but these differences in DOC levels were caused by the differing amounts of throughfall passing through the canopy of the two sites rather than levels of precipitation acidity or air temperature. Temporal variation in the levels of DOC in throughfall was not related to the variation in either precipitation acidity or air temperature. Like throughfall, levels of DOC in forest Boor solutions were not found to be altered by acidic inputs. However, DOC in these solutions increased with seasonal increases in soil temperature. A regression equation relating seasonal variation in soil temperature and forest floor concentrations of DOC estimated that an observed 2.1 degrees C difference in soil temperature at the two sites during the growing season could represent as much as 3.7 mg L(-1) difference in forest floor solution concentrations of DOC.																			0047-2425					SEP-OCT	1995	24	5					927	933		10.2134/jeq1995.00472425002400050021x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1995.00472425002400050021x													WOS:A1995RV38400019
J	KING, GM				KING, GM			DYNAMICS AND CONTROLS OF METHANE OXIDATION IN A DANISH WETLAND SEDIMENT	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The patterns and controls of methane oxidation in a Danish wetland sediment have been determined using a combination of slurry and intact core techniques. Results from slurries indicated that methane oxidation was effectively inhibited by low concentrations of nitrapyrin (9-mu-m) and acetylene (0.5-mu-M) but that oxidation was relatively insensitive to pH between 6 and 8; in addition, high concentrations of ammonia (1 mM) decreased oxidation, especially at alkaline pH. Kinetic analyses of methane oxidation in slurries indicated that V(max) was high relative to values reported for other sediments, that V(max) changed seasonally, that K(m) was consistently low (2-4 mu-M) and the threshold values were low (3-5 nM0 but insufficient to allow consumption of atmospheric methane. Analyses based on intact cores indicated that the extent of methane oxidation was highly dependent on oxygen availability, particularly as affected by benthic photosynthesis or the presence of algal mats. Methane emission and oxidation showed a light saturation response above 400 mu-Einsteins m-2 s-1. Both core and slurry analyses indicated that even short periods of anoxia resulted in losses of the capacity for methane oxidation after re-exposure to air. On the other hand, the presence of anoxia-insensitive organisms provided for a significant residual post-anoxia activity. Results from addition of nitrapyrin to the surface of intact cores indicated that shifts in methane emissions coincident with short-term changes in the availability of oxygen were the result of changes in methane oxidation, not methanogenesis.

The tree species used for this study were red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white oak (Q. alba L.), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata Michaux), and trembling aspen (P. tremuloides Michaux). These are commonly available host trees in the Lake States region. The study spanned two years and was performed at two different field sites in central Michigan. Conclusions drawn from this study include: (1) Large differences in gypsy moth growth and survival can occur even among diet sequences composed of favorable host species. (2) Larvae that spent their first two weeks feeding on red oak performed better during this time period than larvae on all other host species in terms of mean weight, mean relative growth rate (RGR), and mean level of larval development, while larvae on a first host of bigtooth aspen were ranked lowest in terms of mean weight, RGR, and level of larval development. (3) Combination diets do not seem to be inherently better or worse than diets composed of only a single species; rather, insect performance was affected by the types of host species eaten and the time during larval development that these host species were consumed instead of whether larvae ate single species diets or mixed species diets. (4) In diets composed of two host species, measures of gypsy moth performance are affected to different extents in the latter part of the season by the two different hosts; larval weights and development rates show continued effects of the first host fed upon while RGRs, mortality, and pupal weights are affected strongly by the second host type eaten. (5) Of the diets investigated in this study, early feeding on red oak followed by later feeding on an aspen, particularly trembling aspen, is most beneficial to insects in terms of attaining high levels of performance throughout their lives.																			0029-8549					MAR	1994	97	2					143	157		10.1007/BF00323144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00323144								28313923					WOS:A1994ND52000001

However, surface area measurements can be highly time-consuming, especially in the case of heavy branched macrophytes. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between biomass and plant surface, in order to use biomass as a proxy for surface area, and to search for eventual seasonal variability. We quantified the surface-biomass relationship (SBR) as well as the surface/biomass ratio (RSA) and tested the effect of season for five macrophytes: Chara fragifera, Juncus bulbosus, LagarosVton major, Lobelia dortmanna and Phragmites australis. Furthermore, we tested the influence of the sampling position along the stem for the submerged macrophyte Egeria densa. We found a significant correlation between surface area and biomass for all species, suggesting that biomass could be a good surrogate of surface area. However, the SBR and RSA of C. fragifera, L. dortmanna and P. australis varied significantly with the season. For the caulescent species E. densa, the position of the sampling shoot along the stem resulted significant, with a non-significant SBR in the basal section of the stem. We conclude that biomass can be used as a proxy of surface area, but recommend the calibration of models for each investigated species, sampling season and shoot fragment.					; Ribaudo, Cristina/LVS-4250-2024; Jamoneau, Aurélien/AAD-1659-2019	Jamoneau, Aurelien/0000-0003-1181-2269; RIBAUDO, CRISTINA/0000-0001-8992-221X; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				SEP	2017	142						91	95		10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.07.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.07.005													WOS:000412037100013

PRELIMINARY RESULTS	QUATERNAIRE												Guano accumulated in caves by bats or birds contains a stratigraphic record of the environment which may supplement or supply conventionnal terrestrial sedimentary records like lacustrine/palustrine deposits or peat. Thus, guano study allows the understanding of recent or past climate and environment changes, which ability has expanded recently with the development of more sophisticated analytical tools, based on proxies that are indirect measures of past climates or environments preserved in natural archives. In New Caledonia, diurnal cave swiftlet Collocalia spodiopygia and nocturnal Chiroptera Micropterus robustior, both insectivores, share very often the same cavities. The comparison of the content of pollen and isotopes delta C-13 and delta D in their respective guano, shows a great variability of constituents which reflects the sources of the feeding grounds of the eaten preys and their interaction with the ecosystem, more particularly the vegetation. The high richness of pollen taxa, identical to 50 % between the two guanos, underlines the respective food resource areas. The pollen content also shows seasonal variations probably in response to changes in food availability and in turn environmental change, if not climatic changes. This paper presents a preliminary set of results obtained on the 92cm-long core HAK1 retrieved in a guano mound taken under a cave swiftlet roost site in Hama Cave from Lifou (Loyalty Islands). The comparison between yearly mean daily rainfall, carbon (delta C-13) and hydrogen (delta D) isotopes compositions of high-molecular-weight n-alkane (n-C-29) from guano shows a good covariation, which is interpreted as a proxy of ENSO occurrences. Our work confirms that the guano piles are promising records for palaeoenvironmental change studies at high temporal resolution.

J	Håkanson, L				Håkanson, L			Modelling the transport of radionuclides from land to water	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												This paper addresses some fundamental problems related to the structure and function of catchment areas in general and for seasonal (weekly, monthly) mass balance calculations of radionuclides (and metals, organics and nutrients) in particular. A new catchment area model has been developed and critically tested. This modelling approach is based on mechanistic principles. The catchment area is differentiated into inflow (similar todry land) areas and outflow (=wetland) areas. The model also accounts for time-dependent fixation of substances in the catchment related to single-pulse fallouts. The model has a general structure. It is simple to use since there are only two soil type classes and three categories for the outflow areas. In critical tests, the model was put within a framework where it is intended, i.e., within a more comprehensive lake model. Radiocesium was used as a tracer in these tests. Modelled values were compared to empirical data from 23 lakes (351 data on Cs-137 in water, as well as in sediments, small fish and on suspended particles) covering a very wide limnological domain (latitudes from 42 to 61 degreesV, altitudes from 0 to 1090 m ASL, catchment areas from 0.17 to 114,700 km(2), precipitation from 430 to 1840 mm/year, lake areas from 0.042 to 1147 km(2), mean depths from 1.1 to 90 m, pH from 5.1 to 9 units, potassium concentrations from 0.23 to 27.5 mg/l, total P concentrations from 8.3 to 100 mug/l and theoretical water retention times from 0.02 to 137 years). When modelled values were compared to empirical data, the slope was almost perfect (0.99) as well as the coefficient of determination (r(2) =0.96). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

C	Ji, ZG; Morton, MR; Hamrick, JH		Spaulding, ML		Ji, ZG; Morton, MR; Hamrick, JH			Modeling hydrodynamic and water quality processes in a reservoir	ESTUARINE AND COASTAL MODELING, PROCEEDINGS					8th International Conference on Estuarine and Coastal Modeling	NOV 03-05, 2003	Monterey, CA					Despite the progress in three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic, water quality, and sediment diagenesis models and their successful applications in estuaries and bays, few similar 3D modeling studies on lakes and reservoirs have been published. In this study, a 3D hydrodynamic and water quality model has been developed and applied to Lake Tenkiller, Oklahoma. The model includes coupled hydrodynamic, eutrophication, and sediment diagenesis processes. Lake Tenkiller is a manmade reservoir up to 45 meters deep. The lake measures 48 kilometers (km) long, up to 3 in wide, and 70 km(2) in area. Its major water quality issues include nutrient enrichment, eutrophication, and hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. With large lateral variations, the lake needs a 3D model to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality processes in detail. The model has 198 horizontal grid cells and 10 vertical layers. Measured data at 14 stations from February 1986 to September 1986 are available for hydrodynamic and water quality model calibration, including water elevation, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, orthophosphorus, and nitrate-nitrogen. Comparisons between the modeled results and the measured data for all parameters were satisfactory. Seasonal variations of water quality variables in the lake were well replicated. A series of test cases was conducted to illustrate the importance of 3D modeling of lake hydrodynamic and eutrophication processes. It is shown that lake stratification and wind forcing are two major hydrodynamic processes controlling the hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. A seiche signal with a period of 2.36 hours is found in the lake. Theoretical estimation, time series plots, and the Fourier analysis all consistently support this finding. The model is used as a tool for water quality management in the lake.																					0-7844-0734-7				2004							608	627																WOS:000228129600038
J	Mascitti, V				Mascitti, V			Habitat changes in Laguna de Pozuelos, Jujuy, Argentina: Implications for South American Flamingo populations	WATERBIRDS												The three South American flamingos, Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), Andean Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and James' Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), coexist in Laguna de Pozuelos Jujuy Province, northwestern Argentina). This lake is an important overwintering habitat for Andean and James' Flamingos. The Chilean Flamingo is the predominant species and the only one breeding on the lake. This study was conducted from 1992 to 1995, during a period of drought. I report changes in the habitat conditions and how they affect the presence and abundance of flamingo species. Results indicate that in years of below average rainfall, the number of flamingos decreased appreciably, and their expected seasonal pattern of abundance is affected. Chilean Flamingo abundance showed a positive association with the size of the lake, possibly related to the scarcity of deep foraging areas. Zooplankton was lacking, so the presence of Chilean Flamingo might not be related to it. Diatom density was not a limiting resource for James and Andean Flamingos. James' Flamingo preferred to feed near the banks, and was favored by the availability of shallow foraging habitats as the lake contracted. Flamingos recorded in Laguna de Pozuelos represent a fraction of their entire populations within the high-Andes wetland complex. In this context, Pozuelos is an important habitat for flamingos and one of the main breeding grounds for Chilean Flamingo at high altitudes.																			1524-4695						2001	24	1					16	21		10.2307/1522238	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1522238													WOS:000168183300003

The sequence represents a deltaic-lacustrine environment of deposition. The Panguipulli assemblage is composed of 17 species of bryophytic and pteridophytic spores assigned to the genera Apiculatisporis, Aratrisporites, Baculatisporites, Cacheutasporites, Calamospora, Deltoidospora, Dictyophyllidites, Gleicheniidites, Neoraistrickia, Osmundacidites, Punctatisporites and Rogalskaisporites representing almost 17% of the total assemblage. Diverse gimnospermous pollen grains dominate the microflora with 81.9% including 26 species of the genera Accinctisporites, Alisporites, Chordasporites, Cuneatisporites, Cycadopites, Equisetosporites, Falcisporites, Goubinispora, Inaperturopollenites, Klausipollenites, Lunatisporites, Minutosaccus, Platysaccus, Podocarpidites, Protodiploxypinus, Sulcatisporites, Sulcosaccispora and Vesicaspora. The microflora is associated with a megaflora composed of species of the genera Dicroidium, Cladophlebis, Gleichenites, Linguifolium, Pseudoctenis and Sphenobaiera, among others. This microfloristic assemblage differs partially from the only other Triassic microflora previously recorded in Chile from the Llafquentue-Huimpil Formation. Comparison with Argentine and other Gondwanic microfloras, favours an early Late Triassic age for the Paguipulli Formation which corresponds to the Ipswich Microflora of the gondwanic microfloristic provinces. Therefore, the Panguipulli microflora represents floral communities of temperate to warm-temperate climate, highly seasonal, points to a local and moistly environment.																			0002-7014	1851-8044				DEC 30	2003	40	4					585	600																WOS:000220070400006

Seasonal changes in the breeding ratio of isopods and the prevalence of larval acanthocephalan infection showed a reverse trend. Acanthocephalan larvae occurred mainly in males and immature females and were rarely found in mature females. In late immature females, the body size, as indicated by the width of the pleotelson, of infected isopods was significantly larger than that of uninfected ones. These results suggest that acanthocephalans can prevent female isopods from attaining sexual maturity and increasing their body size.					; KAKIZAKI, Tomohiro/E-6304-2011	Nagasawa, Kazuya/0000-0002-6492-1656; 													1439-8621					APR	2003	4	1					43	46		10.1007/s10201-002-0090-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-002-0090-x													WOS:000185159100006
J	Kelley, RH; Jack, JD				Kelley, RH; Jack, JD			Leaf litter decomposition in an ephemeral karst lake (Chaney Lake, Kentucky, USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Litter decomposition in temporary aquatic environments has not been experimentally studied as much as it has in perennial systems. However, litter is likely a critical resource for organisms inhabiting ephemeral aquatic habitats. In this study, we used litterbags under different conditions of submergence and water physical and chemical properties/characteristics to study mass and nutrient losses of terrestrial materials in an ephemeral karst lake in south-central Kentucky (USA). In the first experiment, which was designed to compare decomposition rates in submerged and dry sites, total mass and carbon declined more rapidly in the litter at fully submerged sites than in dry sites. In the second experiment, which was designed to compare decomposition rates in two different submerged environments, total mass and carbon showed similar decomposition trends between the two submerged areas with different seasonal temperature patterns. Nitrogen patterns were variable but in general nitrogen levels increased in the litter in both experiments over a period of several months. These results are similar to those found in some perennially inundated systems and indicate that litter decomposition dynamics in this temporary lake can be greatly affected by lake hydrology. Year-to-year variations in hydrology may thus have strong impacts on nutrient and energy release within this system, which may affect the organisms within this karst lake and in other areas of the karst ecosystem that are ecologically connected to it.																			0018-8158					AUG	2002	482	1-3					41	47		10.1023/A:1021209906661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021209906661													WOS:000179387500005

In two experimental series nearly all epilithic macroinvertebrates normally found at each site settled on the artificial substrates. The analysis of the results showed that the use of artificial substrates is an adequate tool for studying (1) different aspects of the life cycles of species which frequently settle on the plates (e.g. Bryozoa, Corophium curvispinum), (2) seasonal successions of macroinvertebrate communities, and (3) aspects of competition and support within a macroinvertebrate community. The total biomass of macroin vertebrates, in particular the growth of juvenile Dreissena polymorpha, accurately reflected the productivity of the different waters, with highest values for the lake connected to the river, somewhat lower ones for the Rhine, and very low production values for the isolated lake. In other words, a few easily-made measurements of the productivity of primary consumers may be very useful for biological monitoring studies of the floodplains of rivers.

Changes in tick infestation prevalence of passerine birds are seasonal. June and September were the two months in which tick infestation rates were the highest.

J	Mulwafu, WO; Nkhoma, BG				Mulwafu, WO; Nkhoma, BG			The use and management of water in the Likangala Irrigation Scheme Complex in Southern Malawi	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					2nd WaterNet/WARFSA Symposium on Intergrated Water Resource Management: Theory, Practice, Cases (WaterNet 2001)	OCT 30-31, 2001	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA					This paper examines the uses and management of water for agriculture in Lake Chilwa catchment area in Zomba district of Southern Malawi. It focuses on the Likangala Rice Irrigation Scheme Complex situated along the Likangala River. The scheme is one of the largest government-run schemes. Established in the late 1960s by the government to meet the growing demand for rice, the scheme contributes greatly to the agricultural industry of the country. Besides, the scheme was established to ensure maximum utilization of Malawi's largest wetland, which, due to its hydromorphic soils and the littoral floodplains, does not favour the production of traditional upland seasonal crops such as maize. The scheme's overdependence on water from the Likangala River has attracted a considerable degree of academic interest in the use and management of the river to ensure that there is equity and efficiency for both productive and domestic users. The paper focuses on four main issues: the historical development of the scheme, the distribution of water to farmers, social relations, and the overall contribution of the scheme towards the social and economic development of the area and the country in general. The paper contends that the growing population of the basin and the increase in the number of formal and informal smallholder farmers, contributes greatly to the growth of competition and conflicts over water, which tends to undermine the economic potential of the scheme. Furthermore, the paper. provides clearest indication of the need for a realistic and informed water management policy and strategy to solve the growing problem of social inequity without necessarily compromising the production of rice in the scheme.

In this study we present a multivariate analysis and comparison soil chemistry data associated with the presence or absence of two subspecies, O. hupensis robertsoni and O. hupensis hupensis, that are associated with schistosomiasis disease transmission upstream and downstream, respectively, of the soon to be completed Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. Soil and water samples were collected and analyzed from the Anning River Valley, an 800 km(2) area in the mountainous region of Sichuan Province and from the Poyang Lake floodplain, a 4,647 km(2) area in Jiangxi Province. A multivariate classification of soil data was able to discriminate between snail habitat and non-habitat in the Anning River Valley with 85.5% accuracy, and revealed that the lack of critical soil conditions potentially excluded O. hupensis robertsoni from some sites. The soil classification was also able to correctly identify 72.4% of marginal habitat sites that were misclassified by field ecologists. We found that O. hupensis hupensis was less dependent upon soil conditions for sites on the Poyang Lake floodplain, and hypothesize that changes in water level associated with seasonal flooding may play a larger role than soil in discriminating between snail habitat and non-habitat in this environment.					; Spear, Robert/HPE-7505-2023	Spear, Robert/0000-0002-7667-2941; 													0076-2997	2168-9075					2002	44	2					259	272																WOS:000177725100004

In this study, surface sediments from six sampling sites in the Cotonou lagoon (three sites in the channel and three in Lake Nokoue) during the highest stormy season (May, June, and July) were used to assess the urban runoff contribution of PAH accumulation in this ecosystem. This assessment showed relatively high PAH loads (140-625 ng/g) during the rainy season and high inputs of organic materials (total organic carbon contents between 2.5 and 9.5% dry weight). Generally known as originating from different processes, PAHs detected in most of the Cotonou lagoon sampling sites were characterized by the predominance of the high-molecular-weight PAH over the low-molecular-weight PAH, which is an indicator of pyrolytic origin PAH inputs. PAH contamination in the Cotonou lagoon surface sediments was mainly from heavy urban traffic linked to the use of diesel vehicles and to the motorbike taxis proliferating across and around the city. Regression analysis carried out between total PAH concentration and total organic carbon contents showed, excluding the rural sampling site, a positive linear relationship for most samples (R-2 = 0.9996), and confirmed the pyrogenic input of PAHs in the Cotonou lagoon. Mitigation measures were suggested to ameliorate the PAH pollution in the lagoon.

Epizootic Neoplasia of the Lateral Line System of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in New York's Finger Lakes	VETERINARY PATHOLOGY												This article documents an epizootic of inflammation and neoplasia selectively affecting the lateral line system of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in 4 Finger Lakes in New York from 1985 to 1994. We studied more than 100 cases of this disease. Tumors occurred in 8% (5/64) of mature and 21% (3/14) of immature lake trout in the most severely affected lake. Lesions consisted of 1 or more neoplasm(s) in association with lymphocytic inflammation, multifocal erosions, and ulcerations of the epidermis along the lateral line. Lesions progressed from inflammatory to neoplastic, with 2-year-old lake trout showing locally extensive, intense lymphocytic infiltrates; 2- to 3-year-old fish having multiple, variably sized white masses up to 3 mm in diameter; and fish over 5 years old exhibiting 1 or more white, cerebriform masses greater than 1 cm in diameter. Histologic diagnoses of the tumors were predominantly spindle cell sarcomas or benign or malignant peripheral nerve sheath neoplasms, with fewer epitheliomas and carcinomas. Prevalence estimates did not vary significantly between sexes or season. The cause of this epizootic remains unclear. Tumor transmission trials, virus isolation procedures, and ultrastructural study of lesions failed to reveal evidence of a viral etiology. The Finger Lakes in which the disease occurred did not receive substantially more chemical pollution than unaffected lakes in the same chain during the epizootic, making an environmental carcinogen an unlikely primary cause of the epizootic. A hereditary component, however, may have contributed to this syndrome since only fish of the Seneca Lake strain were affected.

VARIATION IN CESTODE ASSEMBLAGES OF MASTOMYS AND ARVICANTHIS SPECIES (RODENTS: MURIDAE) FROM LAKE RETBA IN WESTERN SENEGAL	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												We studied patterns of variation in cestode communities of 3 abundant rodent species that live in sympatry in the Niayes of the Retba Lake, Western Senegal. We evaluated whether the host species have the same parasites and, within host species, whether the variability in parasite community is related to intrinsic (sex, age of the host individual) or extrinsic (habitat, season) factors. Arvicanthis niloticus was parasitized by 2 cestode species, namely Inermicapsifer madagascariensis and the highly dominant Raillietina trapezoides. henna baeri was the only cestode species found in Mastomys erythroleucus, and there was no cestode in M. huberti. Prevalence and abundance levels of cestodes were very high in A. niloticus, especially in adults. Seasonal and habitat effects were found in both cestode communities of M. erythroleucus and A. niloticus. Local host specificity and abundance/prevalence levels suggested variations in the interaction between rodents and cestode intermediate host species among habitats and seasons.

J	Shanks, GD; Biomndo, K; Maguire, J				Shanks, GD; Biomndo, K; Maguire, J			Travel as a risk factor for malaria requiring hospitalization on a highland tea plantation in western Kenya	JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE												Background: Over the past two decades, endemic malaria returned to the western highlands of Kenya, a region that had been free of endemic malaria during the preceding 30 years. A study of malaria patients admitted to a tea estate hospital was conducted to estimate the risk of severe malaria when acquired during travel away from the tea estates compared with infections that had probably been locally acquired. Methods: From May 1998 to March 2000, 1,296 patients were evaluated with a case-control design and standardized questionnaire during their hospitalization. Death certificates from the tea estates were examined from 1964 to 1972 and 1986 to 1999. Results: Travel away from the tea estates during the 2 months prior to hospitalization (n = 432) was strongly associated with a diagnosis of malaria (odds ratio 2.7, 95% Cl 2.1-3.5). The estimate of risk associated with travel was consistent with known malaria endemicity, the Rift Valley Province having a much lower malaria transmission than the area around Lake Victoria. The seasonality of malaria-related deaths indicates that many lowland-origin children probably contracted their fatal infection away from the tea plantation. Conclusions: Travel within Kenya is a significant risk factor for hospitalization owing to malaria on the tea estates; expatriate travelers need to be aware that the East African highlands cannot be regarded as malaria free.

In this population, at least a few months before the rainy season, large males (90-110 mm TL) did not pair. However, they maintained large territories that were defended against conspecific large males and that contained several pairing small males (50-80 mm). Large males occasionally visited the nests of the small pairs in their territories, and selectively took over the nests by attacking the owner male. During the takeover, the large males courted the small females in the nests and might have ejaculated sperm. After the large males left the nests, the small owner males conducted paternal care at the nests. These behaviour patterns of large males are similar to piracy mating reported in ether polygamous fish species. The piracy mating of large male T. temporalis seems to be an alternative tactic when large females are not available.																			0289-0771	1439-5444				JUN	1999	17	1					51	55		10.1007/BF02769297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02769297													WOS:000083860300006
J	Aparicio, E; de Sostoa, A				Aparicio, E; de Sostoa, A			Reproduction and growth of Barbus haasi in a small stream in the N.E. of the Iberian peninsula	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We studied age, growth and reproduction of Barbus haasi, an endemic cyprinid of the Northeast Iberian peninsula, in a small Mediterranean stream of the Llobregat river basin. The females live for 8 years (7+) while the males only live for 7 years (6+). The males grow more slowly than the females; the maximum fork lengths observed were 153 mm in males and 220 mm in females. The equation of Von Bertalanffy that defines growth is: males: L-T = 208.227[1-e(-0.173(t+0.470))]; females: L-T = 448.897[1-e(-0.085(t+0.236))]. This growth rate is one of the lowest recorded for a European barbel population. The overall sex-ratio (265 males:185 females) differed significantly from equality. Sexual maturation occurs from the age class 0+ to 2+ in males, and from 1+ to 3+ in females. The females have multiple spawning, releasing 2 to 5 egg batches depending on their size, such that the largest females spawn more batches than the small ones. The regression between fecundity (Fa) and fork length (FL, mm) is: ln(Fa) = -7.97+/-3.26.ln(FL). The reproductive effort of the females increases progressively with age. The timing and length of the breeding season are related to periods of high stream flow. The life history pattern of this population is characterised by reduced longevity, precocious maturity, multiple spawning and high fecundity, these features being the result of adaptation to the characteristic instability of the river systems of the Mediterranean region.

J	Graham, MD; Vinebrooke, RD				Graham, MD; Vinebrooke, RD			Trade-offs between herbivore resistance and competitiveness in periphyton of acidified lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												It was hypothesized that herbivores regulate periphyton succession in acidified lakes by suppressing loosely attached filamentous algae that otherwise persist and outcompete other growth forms for resources, such as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This hypothesis was tested by conducting grazer-exclosure experiments over an ice-free season in acidified and circumneutral lakes that differed in DIC concentrations. In each lake, the two-factor experimental design had two herbivore (presence-absence) and five succession (early-late) treatments. Total periphyton biomass was greater and significantly suppressed by herbivores in the circumneutral lake. Here, acid-sensitive green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles suppressed loosely attached (i.e., zygnematacean taxa) while stimulating firmly attached (i.e., Coleochaete scutata) algae, causing succession towards a herbivore-resistant physiognomy. Conversely, a loosely attached and tall physiognomy persisted in the absence of significant grazing and greater resource limitation in the acid lake. Our findings suggest that trade-offs between competitiveness and herbivore resistance help predict changes in periphyton in recovering acidified lakes. During recovery, concomitant increases in herbivory and resources should favour a firmly attached and short periphyton physiognomy that is resistant to removal by herbivores, but that lacks the competitiveness of loosely attached and tall forms in DIC-limited acid lakes.

J	Johansson, T; Hakanson, L; Borum, K; Persson, J				Johansson, T; Hakanson, L; Borum, K; Persson, J			Direct flows of phosphorus and suspended matter from a fish farm to wild fish in lake southern Bullaren, Sweden	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												A sediment survey and a field experiment using indicator particles in fish feed were performed in Lake Southern Bullaren, Sweden, which had a fish farm producing approximate to 500 tons/year in the early 1990s. The field experiment shows that wild fish, mainly roach and bream, eat faeces from the cultivated fish. This distributes the farm emissions over a large area. Relatively little phosphorus is, however, bound in wild fish. Budgets for suspended matter and phosphorus are presented. The fish farm produced approximate to 104 tons dry weight/year of faeces, of which about 50 tons dry weight/year were deposited in the lake. These emissions constitute about 9% of the total organic deposition and 9% of the phosphorus deposition in the lake. The increase caused by the fish farm emissions on the TP concentration in the lake may differ Featly from the predicted values using models of the Vollenweider type. An important part of this work is to discuss and highlight uncertainties in data, model predictions and results. Existing standard methods for evaluations of lake eutrophication effects of fish farm emissions based on models of the Vollenweider type need to be revised. New models accounting for seasonal variations, specific emission characteristics and ecological effect variables, such as phytoplankton biomass, are needed to better evaluate effects of fish farm emissions in contexts of lake management.

J	SYVITSKI, JPM; ALCOTT, JM				SYVITSKI, JPM; ALCOTT, JM			RIVER3 - SIMULATION OF RIVER DISCHARGE AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												RIVER3 is an ANSI standard FORTRAN-77 numerical model that simulates the discharge and sediment load of rivers. From basic data on climate, hinterland geometry, and river characteristics, the model predicts four contributions to river how (nival melt, ice melt, rainfall, and groundwater). Input parameters include annual rainfall and snowfall, seasonal evaporation, days per month with measurable rainfall, days per month with temperatures exceeding 5, 10, and 20 degrees C, topography, glacier equilibrium line altitude, seasonal freezing line altitude, areal extent of lakes, sediment transport, and erosion coefficients. The model has both deterministic and stochastic elements for the simulation of daily flow and channel size, and the transport rates for five sediment size fractions (from clay to gravel). The model is deterministic in that given an input file, which includes a random seed number used to determine the magnitude and occurrence of a particular rainfall or snow or ice-melt event, the predicted stream hydrograph will be the same. The model is stochastic in that for each subsequent year being simulated, a different random number operator is used and a different hydrograph is predicted, although the total discharge related to ice melt, snow melt, rainfall, and baseflow is conserved. Model output includes interannual variation of a river's discharge history and sediment transport, and an input file for basin-fill models (DELTA and GRAIN) already in use. RIVER3 is able to offer a variety of applications for the study of regional climatic change (past or future) on fluid discharge and sediment processes.

Ten water depths were examined, four of which correspond to the littoral (1 m, 2 m, 5 m, 10 m), three to the littoriprofundal (l5 m, 20 m, 30 m) and three to the profundaI (60 m, 120 m, 190 m). The sediment was devided into four layers (0-2 cm, 2-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm). (1) The highest proportion of nematodes was found in the top layer. Out of 45 263 nematodes, 89% were found in the first 5 cm of the sediment and only 1% deeper than 10 cm. (2) The proportion of nematodes in the top layer increased along with water depth. Water depth was a better predictor of percentage of nematodes in the top layer than particle size or content of organic carbon in the sediment. (3) There were considerable differences among species in their vertical distribution in the sediment. (4) There was a significant trend for juveniles to occupy more superficial layers than adults across various species. (5) There are time related vertical preferences among adults and juveniles of several nematode species across the year, suggesting vertical migration in the sediment (e.g. Aphanolaimus aquaticus Daday, Eumanhystera longicaudatula Gerlach & Riemann, Tobrilus gracilis Bastian, Monhystera paludicola de Man, Ethmolaimus pratensis de Man and Ironus tenuicaudatus de Man).

The formation, about 800 m thick, comprises alternate braidplain and lacustrine facies associations. Sixteen megacycles, defined by sharp but nonerosive lacustrine flooding surfaces, each comprise a lower lacustrine and an upper braidplain package. Braidplain deposits invariably scour deeply into lacustrine strata. The lacustrine facies association consists of very fine sandstone, mudstone, claystone, coal, and limestone deposited in shallow, hydrologically open freshwater lakes. Lakes were filled by small, elongate, river-dominated deltas, and by suspended and biogenic sediment. Sand-rich deltaic facies represent mouth bar, subaqueous levee, crevasse channel and splay, and straight and sinuous distributary-channel subenvironments. Evidence of wave reworking is very scarce. Interdeltaic areas accumulated platy gray mudstone. As interdistributary bays aggraded to water level they were subject to oxidation and pedogenic modification, forming bright colors, prismatic (desiccation) fabrics, pseudo-anticlines, and calcretes. Thin but laterally extensive (possibly up to 40 km) ''abandonment facies'' comprising black, organic-rich mudstones, coals, and ostracod limestones suggest periods of clastic starvation. Dunes, current ripples, and rarely adhesion ripples are common on the top surfaces of braidplain sandstone packages, preserved beneath a blanket of lacustrine mudstone. Rare oscillation ripples attest to localized reworking of the fluvial sand during or soon after flooding. Flooding surfaces can be traced for 12 km, and possibly up to 40 km, and are attributed to instantaneous subsidence along the northwest margin of the basin during major earthquakes. One locality preserves evidence of abrupt, 180-degrees paleoflow reversals above and below a lacustrine unit. This is intrepreted to record abrupt basin tilting, first to the northwest, forming a lake that filled from the southeast, followed by tilting to the southeast. We interpret Boss Point megacycles to reflect the interaction of episodic tectonic subsidence with longer-term changes in sediment supply controlled by cyclical climatic variation in the Milankovitch band. During periods of pronounced wet-dry seasonality when clastic supply was high, sandy and gravelly braidplain deposits prevailed, and any lakes that formed by eartquake-related subsidence were rapidly filled. During more humid periods, higher vegetative cover greatly reduced clastic supply, and lakes persisted for many thousands of years. Hydrologic changes accompanying the transition from relatively humid to strongly seasonal wet-dry periods might have resulted in the deep fluvial erosion observed at the base of each braidplain package.																			1073-1318					AUG 15	1994	64	3					341	364																WOS:A1994PH79800006

Food webs and nutrient input rates of two lakes were manipulated while a third lake served as a reference system. Phosphorus transport to the sediments was examined by three independent methods: mass-balance budgets, sediment traps, and sediment cores. After 2 years of pretreatment study, manipulated lakes were fertilized for 5 years at rates that were similar within each year but varied among years from 0.97 to 6.0 mg P.m(-2).day(-1). Increased vertical P flux was associated with the increased abundance of large-bodied zooplankton grazers such as Daphnia pulex. Vertical P flux increased with P input rates, but the increase was often insufficient to prevent P accumulation in the water column. Sediment trap measurements of the vertical P flux were significantly higher than the long-term sediment P retention measured by sediment cores and the seasonal sediment P retention calculated by mass balance. Using Pb-210 data from the sediment cores, we corrected the sediment trap measurements of vertical P flux for focusing and brought them into better agreement with the seasonal sediment P retention calculated by mass balance.

The aim was to assess the influence of ecological factors (taxon, habitat, and feeding habits), chemical factors (characterizing different types of lakes), and regional and climatic factors (Hg deposition and mean temperature) on the accumulation of Hg. Concentrations varied from <50 to >5000 ng Hg.g dry weight-1. A large part of this high variability could be ascribed to differences in water and sediment chemistry, ecological niches, and species-specific seasonalities. Both taxonomic composition and Hg concentrations were highly dependent on the type of lake. Concentrations were highest in acidic dystrophic lakes and lowest in oligotrophic lakes. Mean Hg concentrations in the examined taxa within a lake differed 100-fold. Contrary to widely held views on biomagnification, the lowest concentrations among profundal chironomids were found in predators whereas the highest concentrations occurred in detritivores. Seasonal variations were negligible in some taxa but considerable in others and appeared in some taxa to be related to the life cycle. We conclude that Hg accumulation in macroinvertebrates is largely determined by feeding behaviour and food quality.

J	JACK, JD; GILBERT, JJ				JACK, JD; GILBERT, JJ			SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF DIFFERENT-SIZED CILIATES TO DIRECT SUPPRESSION BY SMALL AND LARGE CLADOCERANS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Laboratory experiments compared the susceptibilities of six ciliates and the rotifer Keratella cochlearis to predation and interference from Daphnia pulex and Bosmina longirostris. 2. Susceptibilities of the ciliates to D. pulex were similar to or less than that of the rotifer, and decreased with increasing ciliate size. Most ciliates were just as susceptible to B. longirostris as to the much larger D. pulex. The jumping response of the oligotrich Strobilidium gyrans appeared to be an effective defence against B. longirostris. 3. Clearance rates of B. longirostris and D. pulex on different ciliate species at a density of 1.3 ciliates ml-1 ranged from 1-30 to 5-24 ml ind.-1 day-1, respectively. In natural plankton communities, cladocerans could impose high mortality rates on ciliates and shift the size structure of ciliate assemblages towards larger and less susceptible species.																			0046-5070					FEB	1993	29	1					19	29		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00740.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00740.x													WOS:A1993KR16500003

Periphytic algae dynamics in lentic ecosystems in the Brazilian semiarid	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The hydrological periods drive the structure and organization of aquatic communities in semiarid regions. We hypothesize that a decrease of the precipitation during the dry period will favor the development of the periphytic algal community, leading to higher richness and density in this period. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the changes in the periphytic algal community structure in three shallow and eutrophic ecosystems of the Brazilian semiarid. The sampling was performed between 2007 and 2010 at two-mensal intervals. The sampling of periphytic algal was performed in aquatic macrophytes and rocks. The abiotic variables were analyzed simultaneously. Dominance in diatoms, cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, respectively, was observed in two periods. In the dry period, waters were alkaline and had high concentrations of nitrate and total phosphorus associated with the highest densities of Bacillariophyceae. In the rainy period the water was warmer, oxygenated and high concentrations of ammonia and soluble reactive phosphorus with diatoms remained dominant but with reduced density, while cyanobacteria and chlorophytes increased. Overall, periphytic algal community composition no responded to changes in the hydrological periods. However, the hydrological periods altered the dynamics of periphytic algal community, supported by the alternation of the most representative classes (diatoms and cyanobacteria) between the hydrologic periods. Our data suggest that the morphometric and chemical and physical characteristics of lentic aquatic ecosystems studied were more important in the dynamics of periphytic algal community than the hydrological periods and types of substrates.

The aim of this study is to identify temporal and spatial variations, as well as hydrological processes in the alpine cold region. The results show that there was no significant difference in water chemical characteristics of various waterbodies, and no obvious temporal variation, but exhibited spatial variation. In the wet season, various waterbodies are enriched in oxygen delta O-18 and deuterium delta D due to a temperature effect. Precipitation and the temperature decrease during the dry season, which cannot easily be affected by secondary evaporation. The d-excess (deuterium excess) of various waterbodies was greater than 10 parts per thousand. There are no altitude effects during wet and dry seasons because the recharged water resources are different in the wet and dry seasons. It is influenced by the freezing-thawing process of glacier snow and frozen soil. The river water is recharged by thawed frozen soil water and precipitation in the wet season, but glacier snow meltwater with negative delta O-18 and delta D is less (14-18%). In the dry season, glacier snow meltwater and groundwater are the dominant source of the river water, and thawed frozen soil water is less (10-15%).

HCH (BHC) showed higher levels in soil during wet season, reflecting the application of technical HCH largely during the flowering season of rice. On the other hand, DDT residues were low and did not show a significant seasonal trend in soil or sediment, indicating small quantities of DDT utilized at present for agricultural purposes in India. When compared to soil, the residue levels in sediments are low and the seasonal variation is less pronounced. This indicates that in tropical watersheds, the relative flux of residues into the aquatic environment is smaller than the amount volatilized to the atmosphere.

BANK FILTRATION AS A WATER TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE FOR THE REMOVAL OF CYANOBACTERIA AND CYANOTOXINS	INTERCIENCIA												Removal of cyanobacteria from water requires the water treatment systems to prevent the breakage of the cells, so as to avoid the possible increase of cyanotoxin concentration. The effective removal of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins normally requires systems with several stages. Bank filtration (BF) is presented as an effective alternative to eliminate or reduce those pollutants. BF involves pumping water from wells or infiltration galleries located on the banks of the superficial water bodies. It can operate as a sole treatment or as a rather effective pre-treatment. Some of the parameters that determine the removal of algae and cyanobacteria include the shape and size of the cells, the type of material from the aquifer and the bottom of the water source, and the distance/travel time of the water to the wells. Removal of cyanotoxins can occur by adsorption and biodegradation mechanisms; both of them depend on the type of water body bottom and aquifer materials, and on the physicochemical characteristics of the cyanotoxins. In general, for the successful implementation of BF, a hydraulic connection between the bed of the water source and the local groundwater must exist. It is also necessary to study local conditions such as temperature, type and amount of organic matter in the water, redox conditions and changes in the level of rivers and lakes in extreme conditions (dry and rainy seasons).					; Pizzolatti, Bruno/AAU-6174-2021; Sens, Mauricio/KRP-6705-2024	Sens, Mauricio Luiz/0000-0001-5013-4267; PIZZOLATTI, BRUNO/0000-0002-2765-7040; Romero-Esquivel, Luis G./0000-0002-7191-3195; 													0378-1844					APR	2013	38	4					253	259																WOS:000324666200003

Effect of Environmental Conditions and Human Activities on Vertical Distribution Characteristics of Bacterial Communities in Shallow Lakes Sediments	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial community structure in different sediment layers in the lakes such as Jiulongkou lake, Dazong lake and Wujindang lake located in Lixia river regions (regions between Liyunhe canal and Xiahe river) of the Huai river basin under the stress of nature and human activities. The diversity and dominance of bacterial community using the 16S rDNA cloning-sequencing approach were determined within the appropriate sediment layers. Quantity software and UPGAMA cluster analysis were used to analyze the vertical distribution characteristics of bacterial community in combination with the related environmental data. The results show that there is an abundant diversity of bacteria in the lake sediments in Lixia river regions and there are differences in the abundance of longitudinal bacteria at different layers. The abundance of the middle layer is comparatively high, while the upper layer is lower and the lower layer is the lowest. Although there are some common clones in the sediments at different layers, the composition of predominant bacteria at different layers apparently varies. The experimental results show that the human activities have considerable impact on the environment of sediments in the downstream lakes and affect the bacterial community structure of sediments.					; Wu, Tingfeng/KDN-9741-2024	Wu, Tingfeng/0000-0002-9985-7746; 													0970-7077	0975-427X				APR	2013	25	4					2015	2023		10.14233/ajchem.2013.13279	http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2013.13279													WOS:000312621500056

Daphnia cucullata feeding on mixed diets	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					1st International-Plankton-Ecology-Group Workshop on the Role of Food Quality for Zooplankton	MAR 17-21, 1996	CTR LIMNOL, NIEUWERSLUIS, NETHERLANDS	Int Plankton Ecol Grp	CTR LIMNOL			1. The effects of feeding on suboptimal foods were investigated in Daphnia cucullata a zooplankton common in many types of lakes. Eleven clones of D. cucullata were collected from four lakes of varying trophic levels and fed a high (1 mg C l(-1)) concentration of one of two diets: (i) a 1:9 mixture of the cryptophyte Cryptomonas pyrenoidifera with the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus; and (ii) a 1:9 mixture of the cryptophyte C. pyrenoidifera with the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria limnetica. 2. As expected, the diet dominated by Oscillatoria was found to be significantly poorer compared with the diet dominated by Scenedesmus. All D. cucullata clones were, however, able to achieve positive population growth rates on both diets, supporting the view that daphnids can grow and reproduce on a diet dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria. 3. Clones originating from different types of lakes differed in their responses to the two diets. On the Scenedesmus-dominated diet, clones originating from moderately eutrophic lakes had lower population growth rates than clones from hypertrophic lakes. In contrast, on the Oscillatoria-dominated diet, the clones from moderately eutrophic lakes had higher population growth rates than clones from hypertrophic lakes. Contrary to expectation, clones originating from lakes dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria had more difficulty utilizing filamentous cyanobacteria as food than crones from less eutrophic lakes which contain less filamentous cyanobacteria. 4. As the reactions of clones originating from same type of lake resembled each other, it is hypothesized that the life histories of D. cucullata populations are locally adapted to environmental factors other than abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria, which are correlated with trophic levels.

(greater-than-or-equal-to 130 mum), and Stentor coeruleus (greater-than-or-equal-to 280 mum) and the flagellate Astasia longa (14 mum) were evaluated in laboratory experiments. Adult Acanthodiaptomus consumed all species, but not in proportion to their size. At low concentrations (prey <200 mug C.L-1), mean clearance rates ranged from 80 mL.copepod-1.d-1 (for Paramecium) to 13 mL.copepod-1.d-1 (for Loxodes). Clearance rates declined with increasing concentration of the same prey, as expected. Prey capture and ingestion was determined by cell width and prey escape reactivity. Hunger significantly increased predation rates at high prey levels. The presence of algae enhanced ciliate predation by hungry copepods at low prey levels, but had no other significant effects. Protozoan predation by Acanthodiaptomus generally exceeds its feeding on algae and nanoplankton. Results suggest that ciliates can be a significant part of the diet of some suspension-feeding freshwater copepods in situ, confirming the importance of ciliates as mediators of energy transfer from the microbial loop to higher trophic levels.

Trade caravans traversing these networks were organized by dan elders capable of exploiting kinship heirarchies to obtain the necessary labor. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the growing demand of European factors for rubber and ivory led to intense commercial competition among Galwa, Fang, Enenga and Bakele clans. Though conflict often disrupted trade, the organization of labor required to obtain forest products remained under the control of the local dan leaders through the first decade of the twentieth century. It was only with the false start of a timber industry prior to World War I and then its resumption beginning in the 1920s that a profound transformation of labor was accomplished. Lambarene became the ambiguous center of a regional colonial economy that absorbed wage-labor in modern capitalist fashion and eclipsed precolonial practice. The presence of relatively accessible okoume trees along the Middle Ogooue and its surrounding lakes region was the key factor in bringing about this transformation. 'Le roi okoume' was a fickle patron. With the development of an economic network consisting of hundreds of temporary lumber camps employing thousands of laborers, timber exploitation did not result in significant investment in infastructure. But it did absorb labor. Timber brought a growing though mobile population to the Middle Ogooue, one that was able to move from camp to camp in relative freedom due to the scarcity of workers but one that also taxed the region's resources: Due to the seasonal nature of employment and the impact of the Depression, 'vagabondage' became a major concern and colonial officials sought solutions in village regroupment. An analysis of French attempts to regulate workers in the 1930s and how these advanced the development of a colonial wage-labor market capable of serving the needs of a modern state is the focus of the final section.																			0021-8537						1999	40	1					87	107		10.1017/S0021853798007361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0021853798007361													WOS:000079686500005

Levels of plasma testosterone (T), estradiol-17 beta (E2) and 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta P) were measured in three groups of fish : the roach swimming up the fish pass, those entering the backwaters and those caught in the main channel. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and relation between stages of maturity and hormone concentrations were also determined. The migration can be divided into a prespawning migration from early February to late March limited to an intense moving of roach to the backwaters and a spawning migration in April and May. In the former period, all fish in exogenous vitellogenesis presented high levels of E2 (1.30 +/- 0.64 ng/ml early March) and low levels of other steroid hormones. During the spawning period, roach migrating to the backwaters had higher GSI (18 % in the females caught in mid-May) than those migrating upstream through the fish pass (about 15 % in April). High levels of T (maximum 2.71 ng/ml and 1.06 ng/ml, in backwater and fish pass samples respectively) and 17,20 beta P (maximum 19.2 ng/ml and 12.7 ng/ml in backwater and fish pass samples, respectively) were measured during the spawning season. However, T and E2 levels (up to 5.5 ng/ml for both hormones) were significantly higher in fish caught in the main channel of the river at about 2 kms from the migration sites (fish pass and backwater inlet).																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1999	61	2					111	121		10.1007/s000270050056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000270050056													WOS:000080772400002

This is a small stratified lake created by subsidence of an underground coal mine. The results show a permanent stratification and the development of two water bodies with contrasting chemistry. The superficial oxic layer (i.e. the upper 5 m) is of high water quality and the water, not affected by seasonal changes, is suitable as a source of drinking water. In contrast, the deeper layer is permanently anoxic and the waters have a conductivity which is six times greater than in the epilimnion. Due to density difference and the small size of the lake, no turn-over occurs and all elements that diffuse from bottom sediments are strongly concentrated in the hypolimnion. Arsenic concentrations are very low in the epilimnion, but they increase quickly with depth below the oxycline, to reach up to 7 mu M below 8 m depth. Different solid phases could control the fate of arsenic in this lake such as gypsum for As(V) in the hypolimnion, mackinawite for As(V) and As(III) in the hypolimnion, and close to the oxycline, Fe(III) oxyhydroxides are possible hosts for both As(III) and As(V).

Dry deposition was collected only at La Esperanza. Volume weighted average pH values of the rainfall samples were between 4.23 and 4.64, individual samples reaching as low as pH 3.0. An excess of sulfate greater than 96% was obtained at both sites. The wet deposition of hydronium and sulfate showed the same seasonal cycle. The highest inputs were obtained in April during the early rainy season, and November which is the second peak rainfall period. The amounts of (NH4 + NO3)-N ha(-1) yr(-1) added by wet deposition ranged from 5.2 kg at La Esperanza to 11.4 kg at Catatumbo (ammonium accounts for about 67% of these amounts)? and the corresponding amounts of SO4-S deposited ranged From 10.5 to 12.5 kg, respectively. These amounts of S and N annually deposited by precipitation are substantially higher than those found in eastern Venezuelan sites, and slightly lower than the values reported for rural areas of Europe and North America. In La Esperanza it was estimated that wet deposition accounts for about 93% of the inorganic-N and for about 80% of the SO4-S annually added by dry and wet deposition. It is envisaged that in Lake Maracaibo Basin large argricultural and uncultivated land areas downwind of the El Tablazo Petrochemical Complex, Cardon-Amuay and, probably, the Aruba-Curacao refineries and urban Maracaibo might already be affected by anthropogenic air pollution as evidenced by the higher level of H+, SO4-2, NO3- and NH4+ wet deposition found at the La Esperanza and Catatumbo sites in comparison with other rural sites in Venezuela.

J	Boulion, VV; Håkanson, L				Boulion, VV; Håkanson, L			A new general dynamic model to predict biomass and production of bacterioplankton in lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The main aim of this work is to present a new dynamic model to predict bacterioplankton production and biomass. This model has been developed as a submodel within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which is based on nine key functional groups of organisms. Beside bacterioplankton, LakeWeb accounts for phytoplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), two types of fish (prey and predatory), as well as zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The model uses ordinary differential equations and gives seasonal (weekly) variations and accounts in a general way for all major abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks for entire lakes (the ecosystem, approach). The new dynamic model has not been calibrated and tested in the traditional way using data from one or a few well-investigated lakes. Instead, it has been calibrated using empirical regressions based on data from many fakes. We have presented empirical reference models utilising data from a new database, which includes many lakes situated in the former Soviet Union. They were investigated during the Soviet period and those results have been largely unknown in the West. The basic aim of the dynamic model is that it should capture typical functional and structural patterns in many lakes. We have given algorithms for (1) bacterioplankton production, (2) elimination (related-to the turnover time of bacterioplankton), (3) bacterioplankton consumption by herbivorous zooplankton, and the factors influencing these processes/rates. We have demonstrated that the new dynamic model gives predictions that agree well with the values given by the empirical reference models, and also expected and requested divergences from these regressions when they do not provide sufficient resolution. the new. dynamic model is driven by data easily accessed from standard monitoring programs or maps and meant to be of practical use in lake management.

J	LeBreton, GTO; Beamish, FH				LeBreton, GTO; Beamish, FH			Interannual growth variation in fish and tree rings	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Interannual growth variations were compared among neighbouring populations of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and white spruce (Picea glauca), white pine (Pinus strobus), and red pine (Pinus resinosa). Measures of growth were obtained by removing long-term trends from widths of rings in the hard tissues of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms and assembling these measures into growth chronologies. Interannual growth variations were negatively correlated (r) between sturgeon and nearby tree population chronologies for those fish populations that displayed strong interseries correlation ((r) over bar). The three sturgeon population chronologies developed from individuals that displayed the lowest interseries correlation coefficients failed to display significant correlation with tree growth. The results of this investigation indicate that the negative relationships between fish and tree growth may be related to annual fluctuations in air temperature. In general, fish population chronologies displayed positive correlation with measures of air temperature during the current season of growth, while tree population chronologies displayed negative correlation with air temperatures from either the current or the previous season of growth.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2000	57	11					2345	2356		10.1139/cjfas-57-11-2345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-11-2345													WOS:000165451000017
J	Williams, MW; Rikkers, M; Pfeffer, WT				Williams, MW; Rikkers, M; Pfeffer, WT			Ice columns and frozen rills in a warm snowpack, Green Lakes Valley, Colorado, USA	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												Here we provide information on ice columns and frozen rills found in late-season snowpacks in and near the Green Lakes Valley of the Colorado Front Range, USA. The presence of ice columns and frozen rills in late season snowpacks may provide insights with which to understand the spatial distribution of preferential flowpaths in melting snowpacks. In July and August of 1996 and 1997 we found ice columns in every one of the more than 50 snow fields we investigated. The ice columns showed a consistent morphology; each column was approximately 75 cm in vertical extent, with about 5 cm projecting above the snow surface and 70 cm extending into the snowpack. An analysis of variance test shows that the 81 ice columns on the south-facing slopes were significantly greater than the 57 ice columns on the north-facing slope (p = 0.01). There were about 3 ice columns per square metre on the southfacing slopes and 2 ice columns per square metre on the north-facing slopes. There was an interesting hysteresis in snow and ice temperatures that became stronger with increasing depth in adjacent thermocouple arrays. This hysteresis in the temperature profiles is consistent with the release of latent heat from the freezing of greater amounts of liquid water in and near the ice columns compared to the surrounding snowpack. At the Martinelli catchment, spacing between the frozen rills averaged 2.6 m (n = 73). We interpret these "ribs" of solid ice to be the remnants of surface rids. Vertical ice columns were connected to these frozen rills. The ice columns and frozen rills may provide a snapshot or "schematic" diagram of the major flowpaths in a ripe and draining snowpack.																			0029-1277						2000	31	3					169	186																WOS:000089889800002

Miniaturized Temperature-Controlled Planar Chromatography (Micro-TLC) as a Versatile Technique for Fast Screening of Micropollutants and Biomarkers Derived from Surface Water Ecosystems and During Technological Processes of Wastewater Treatment	JOURNAL OF AOAC INTERNATIONAL												There is increasing interest in the development of simple analytical systems enabling the fast screening of target components in complex samples. A number of newly invented protocols are based on quasi separation techniques involving microfluidic paper-based analytical devices and/or micro total analysis systems. Under such conditions, the quantification of target components can be performed mainly due to selective detection. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that miniaturized planar chromatography has the capability to work as an efficient separation and quantification tool for the analysis of multiple targets within complex environmental samples isolated and concentrated using an optimized SPE method. In particular, we analyzed various samples collected from surface water ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and the Baltic Sea of Middle Pomerania in the northern part of Poland) in different seasons, as well as samples collected during key wastewater technological processes (originating from the "Jamno" wastewater treatment plant in Koszalin, Poland). We documented that the multiple detection of chromatographic spots on RP-18W microplates-under visible light, fluorescence, and fluorescence quenching conditions, and using the visualization reagent phosphomolybdic acid enables fast and robust sample classification. The presented data reveal that the proposed micro-TLC system is useful, inexpensive, and can be considered as a complementary method for the fast control of treated sewage water discharged by a municipal wastewater treatment plant, particularly for the detection of low molecular mass micropollutants with polarity ranging from estetrol to progesterone, as well as chlorophyll-related dyes. Due to the low consumption of mobile phases composed of water alcohol binary mixtures (less than 1 mL/run for the simultaneous separation of up to nine samples), this method can be considered an environmentally friendly and green chemistry analytical tool. The described analytical protocol can be complementary to those involving classical column chromatography (HPLC) or various planar microfluidic devices.

J	KEBEDE, E; BELAY, A				KEBEDE, E; BELAY, A			SPECIES COMPOSITION AND PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS IN A TROPICAL AFRICAN LAKE (LAKE AWASSA, ETHIOPIA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The species composition and phytoplankton biomass of Lake Awassa, Ethiopia were studied from September 1985 to July 1986 in relation to some limnological features of the lake. During the study period, three phases of thermal stratification were recognized: a period of unstable stratification and near-complete mixing was followed by a stable stratification period and another period of complete mixing. Complete mixing was associated with cooling of air temperature with an influx of cool rain and high rainfall. The underwater light penetration showed a similar pattern over the whole period with the highest in the red, and the lowest in the blue spectral region. Euphotic depth varied between 1.6 and 3.0 meters with the highest measurements corresponding to the stable stratification period. PO4-P concentrations ranged between 23 and 45 mug l-1 and NO3-N concentrations varied between 7 and 14 mug l-1 during the study period. Both nutrients showed increasing values associated with mixing periods and/or the rainy season. A total of 100 phytoplankton species were identified with 48% of the taxa represented by green algae, 30% by blue-green algae, 11 % by diatoms, and the rest by chrysophytes, dinoflagellates, cryptomonads and euglenoids. The dominant phytoplankton species were Lyngbya nyassae, Botryococcus braunii and Microcystis species. Seasonal biomass variation was pronounced in the first two species but not in Mycrocystis. Phytoplankton biomass increased following the mixing period in December, and thermal destratification during May to July which was also a period with high rainfall and relatively high nutrient concentration. While the seasonal variation of the total phytoplankton community in Lake Awassa was relatively low (coefficient of variation < 20%), it was higher in some of the individual component species.																			0018-8158					AUG 5	1994	288	1					13	32		10.1007/BF00006802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006802													WOS:A1994PE94900002

J	Jayalakshmy, KV; Rao, KK				Jayalakshmy, K. V.; Rao, K. Kameswara			Aspects of the biodiversity of brackish water foraminifera	ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS												Foraminiferal fauna of the Chilka lake situated between 19 degrees 25' and 19 degrees 54' N and 85 degrees 6' and 85 degrees 38' E in Orissa state on the east coast of India during different seasons was studied using Pielou's, Simpson's, Margalef' s, Shannon - Wiener's, and Heip's evenness indices of diversity. Mean diversity levels were low during the postmonsoon period ( November) when there is heavy rainfall followed by the diluting effects of the river systems of the area; however, levels were high during the premonsoon season ( March and May) due to prevalence of marine conditions in the lake. Furthermore, the evaluation of different sectors in the study area showed somewhat poor diversity within the lagoon and rich diversity in the outer channel, the fauna of which was similar to the nearshore foraminiferids of Bay of Bengal. The spatial pattern of species diversity was predictable and was related to environmental features of the areas in the lake. Regarding the spatial community structure, outer channel showed highly stable environment due to its proximity to the sea whereas northern sector showed highly fluctuating environment being away from the oceanic region and highly affected by variations in the salinity. Seasonal comparison showed postmonsoon season as the most consistent period, whereas early premonsoon was the least consistent period. Bray-Curtis group linkage cluster analysis showed that none of the clusters of foraminiferal species present during post-monsoon occurred during pre-monsoon. In contrast to this observation, approximately 30% of the species were always clustered together during early premonsoon and late premonsoon, indicating the possibility of succession of species during November. An interesting observation was that a species replacement takes place in the case of foraminiferal fauna over a seasonal cycle. This finding could be an indication of the seasonality of this community through species succession.																			1527-5922	1527-5930				DEC	2006	7	4					353	367		10.1080/15275920600996370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275920600996370													WOS:000242558400008

REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												As result of its biological and ecological strategies, Pseudupeneus grandisquamis is a dominant species in the demersal community of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico. Our main objective was to understand these strategies with respect to distribution, abundance and reproduction. We analyzed 5 175 individuals representing partial collections from five oceanographic expeditions between 1989 and 1990. It is a typical demersal marine species, with a wide distribution on the continental shelf. The highest abundance of P. grandisquamis occurs in March and November, around the 40 m isobath, facing the Superior-Inferior lake systems and Mar Muerto Lagoon. Reproduction occurred during all of the months studied, particularly from August to October, corresponding to the rainy season, when the salinity and temperature is lower. The presence of juveniles, principally in November and March, suggests a long period of recruitment; they are distributed mainly in the Superior-Inferior Lagoons, which serves as a nursery area where they remain until they are adults. The total female to male sex ratio was nearly 1: 1 throughout the year. The maximum total length was 213 mm and the size at first maturity was 138 mm TL. The high abundance and reproduction occur when the gulf has a high level of ecological production, in accordance with the dynamics of the system, where the influence of coastal lagoons is important. Protection strategies for the area above the continental shelf of the Gulf of Tehuantepec are recommended for the estuary processes and for the reproduction and rearing of a large number of species, including P grandisquamis.																			0034-7744	2215-2075				DEC	2006	54	4					1103	1112											18457146					WOS:000244732200006

REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Girardinichthys multiradiatus, locally known as "mexcalpique", is a small endemic fish of the Lerma river basin. Its presence in lakes (Zempoala) suggests a long-standing connection between these lakes and the river basin. The current range of this species in the Mexico and Toluca valley appears to have been reduced, making this park a refuge for the species. Nevertheless, little is known about its biology. We studied its diet and feeding habits in Acoyotongo Lake, Lagunas de Zempoala National Park (19 degrees 01'30"-19 degrees 06' N, 99 degrees 16'20"-99 degrees 21' W) where seasonal collections were carried out. The gut contents of 97 specimens were identified to the most specific taxonomic category possible and analyzed with numeric and frequency of occurrence methods. The general diet of this species consists of twelve dietary components, eleven of which are of animal origin. Hymenopterans, springtails and chironomids represented the highest percentage of ingestion and preference. G. multiradiatus is as a carnivorous species with entomophagous tendencies.																			0034-7744	2215-2075				DEC	2006	54	4					1247	1255											18457162					WOS:000244732200023
J	Griffiths, RP; Entry, JA; Ingham, ER; Emmingham, WH				Griffiths, RP; Entry, JA; Ingham, ER; Emmingham, WH			Chemistry and microbial activity of forest and pasture riparian-zone soils along three Pacific northwest streams	PLANT AND SOIL												Throughout the United States, agricultural practices are responsible for large quantities of nutrients entering lakes and streams. Previous studies have shown that forested riparian areas can filter nutrients from surface runoff and groundwater that may potentially contaminate lakes and streams. This study examined seasonal differences in soil chemistry and soil microorganisms in paired mixed-forest riparian and pasture systems, the aim being to gain understanding of the sequestering of N and P. The forest soils retained higher levels of organic C and N, mineralizable N, extractable P, and fungal biomass, and had higher respiration rates than pasture soils. These findings suggest that forested riparian zones have a greater capacity than pasture soils to sequester C and retain nutrients. In past studies, fungal biomass has been shown to be less than bacterial biomass in grassland soils, but in this study, fungal biomass was greater than bacterial biomass throughout the year in both forest and pasture soils.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				MAR	1997	190	1					169	178		10.1023/A:1004211121095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004211121095													WOS:A1997XJ61000018

In both light conditions, the community consisted of 18 taxa (under nine genera) of Bacillariophyceae. Amphora lineolata, Cocconeis placentula, and Diatoma hiemale were the most common and abundant species. The total algal density was significantly higher in the high light condition and on the basal plant part than in the low light condition and on the apical plant part.

The study period was June 25 to July 28, 1990. Measurements were made over a peat bog consisting of a mixture of sphagnum moss and lichen hummocks and black pools. About 200 m west of the tower were several shallow ponds. The hummocks had a dry, insulating surface and were underlain by an ice layer near 50 cm depth until mid-July. At the beginning of the period the black pools were covered with water, and although the free water gradually disappeared over the study period, they remained saturated to the end of July. The depth of peat near the tower was about 3 m. Despite the ice layer under the hummocks, their daytime surface temperatures were high, near 35 degrees C, and after the middle of July, above 40 degrees C. Inspection of temperature, precipitation, and radiation data showed that the midsummer period of 1990 was warmer, drier, and sunnier than usual at Moosonee and so by inference at Lake Kinosheo. When all the data were combined to yield average diurnal energy balance components, the eddy correlation fluxes accounted for 90% of the available energy. Latent heat flux averaged 46% of the total available energy and the sensible heat flux averaged 34%. Daytime Bowen ratios were near 1 for the experimental period, suggesting that the bog behaved more like a dryland than a wetland. Eddy correlation measurements of sensible heat and latent heat flux were less than those measured using the Bowen ratio energy balance technique, the average ratios being 0.81 and 0.86, respectively. These differences were possibly due to the difficulty in measuring energy balance components of net radiation and ground heat flux over the mosaic surface.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 20	1994	99	D1					1539	1549		10.1029/93JD00032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JD00032													WOS:A1994MT03200041

Due to its geographical location, the water of this lake is influenced by human activities from the upper basin, such as agricultural development, urban and industrial wastewater discharges which vary in intensity depending on the season. In this study the techniques of interpolation IDW (Inverse Distance Weight) and Kriging were applied to values of a water quality index named ICA2. The integrated tool Geostatistics Analyst in Arc-GIS 9.2 software was used to check if it is possible to get a proper ICA2 spatial interpolation with the employed methods and which of them would be the best technique to estimate the quality of water. With the observed and interpolated values of ICA2 index, a series of maps were obtained that allow us to conclude that both methods are valid for estimating trends in water quality. However, slightly better results have been obtained with the Kriging method.					; Gonzalez-Garcia, Concepcion/L-3880-2014; Garcia-Garcia, Maria/ABH-1259-2020	GARCIA GARCIA, MARIA JESUS/0000-0002-1213-6963; 													1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2013	51	13-15					2609	2616		10.1080/19443994.2012.749194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2012.749194													WOS:000316983000011

Multiple date SPOT panchromatic data (10- by 10-m spatial resolution) obtained in April and October of 1988 through 1990 were analyzed using digital image processing techniques to inventory the spatial distribution of cattail and waterlily beds in a freshwater reservoir located on the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The remote sensing derived wetland information was highly correlated with in situ cattail and waterlily measurements (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 0.95) made at 48 transects during the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons. In addition, the creation of a multiple date color composite using October 1988, 1989, and 1990 SPOT panchromatic data proved to be a very effective method to visually identify the change in aquatic macrophyte distribution through time. These remote sensing techniques should be applicable to other southeastern lakes and reservoirs, which have large beds of cattails and waterlilies with similar phenological cycles and lake hydrology.																			0099-1112					APR	1993	59	4					519	525																WOS:A1993KV86700007

Movement of nutrients and contaminants to and from Everglades peat porewater could have important consequences for Everglades water quality and ecosystem restoration activities. In a study of Everglades porewater, we observed complex, seasonally variable peat porewater chloride concentration profiles at several locations. Analyses and interpretation of these changing peat porewater chloride concentration profiles identifies processes controlling conservative solute movement at the peat-surface water interface, that is, solutes whose transport is minimally affected by chemical and biological reactions. We examine, with an advection-diffusion model, how alternating wet and dry climatic conditions in the Florida Everglades mediate movement of chloride between peat porewater and marsh surface water. Changing surface water-chloride concentrations alter gradients at the interface between peat and overlying water and hence alter chloride flux across that interface. Surface water chloride concentrations at two frequently monitored sites vary with marsh water depth, and a transfer function was developed to describe daily marsh surface water chloride concentration as a function of marsh water depth. Model results demonstrate that porewater chloride concentrations are driven by changing surface water chloride concentrations, and a sensitivity analysis suggests that inclusion of advective transport in the model improves the agreement between the calculated and the observed chloride concentration profiles.

B.S.P.) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stands following fire (i) to determine if there is a time lag between black spruce and jack pine establishment and (ii) to compare the composition of the regeneration with regard to the original stand. The study was conducted in an area burnt in 1983, 100 km northwest of Lake Saint-Jean, Quebec. Five years after fire, the age structure of the regeneration shows an early establishment of jack pine and black spruce, with more than 95% of the seedlings established during the first three growing seasons after fire (excluding the year of fire). The age structures were similar in mature stands and in the regeneration for the jack pine while they differed for black spruce. Errors in age determination due to suppression of adult trees sampled or other causes could explain the difference in the establishment pattern of young and mature black spruces. Compared with the mature stand, the postfire regeneration had an increased proportion of jack pine. The study concludes that both species can regenerate shortly after fire, but in somewhat varying proportions.																			0045-5067					APR	1992	22	4					474	481		10.1139/x92-062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x92-062													WOS:A1992HW44400010

In addition, on 4 occasions a special program of intensive sampling was executed. Starting 1 hour before sunset and 2.5 hours before sunrise and lasting for 3.5 hours, the sampling was performed every half hour. Simultaneously, light intensity was registered continuously at 20 cm below the water surface. From April 18 until May 21 juveniles, adults without eggs and adults with eggs were distributed about equally over the first 7 meters, at noon as well as at midnight. Two weeks later, all categories performed a diel vertical migration. The period of DVM lasted until June 26. During this migration period, large shoals of juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) were present in the open water zone. The guts of these visual predators were filled with D. hyalina. The rapid coming into existence of this DVM excludes selection for a migrating genotype and makes a phenotypic induction plausible. Since it has been described for D. hyalina that an exudate of juvenile perch enhances the phototactic reaction to relative changes in light intensity (RINGELBERG, 1991), these fish are thought to provide the cue for induction of a DVM in Lake Maarsseveen. The objective of the special program of frequent sampling was to study the daily timing of the upward and downward swimming and to correlate these movements with different aspects of the light signal. Migration started well after sunset and coincided with maximal relative decreases in light intensity. Contrary, high absolute decreases in light intensity occurred some time before sunset. The downward movement started about 1.5 hours before sunrise and coincided with maximal relative increases in light intensity. Migration was terminated before the large increases in absolute light intensity occurred. So it is concluded, that the photo-reaction at the base of this DVM is comparable to that studied in the laboratory. This supports the idea of a phenotypic induction of DVM by juvenile perch. The paper is concluded with remarks on the use of terms like proximate and ultimate at different levels of biological integration.																			0003-9136					APR	1991	121	2					129	145																WOS:A1991FL44900001
J	Mayer, PM; Galatowitsch, SM				Mayer, PM; Galatowitsch, SM			Diatom communities as ecological indicators of recovery in restored prairie wetlands	WETLANDS												Diatoms were employed to assess the recovery of northern prairie wetlands restored after drainage. We predicted that diatom species diversity and equitability are lower in restored wetlands than in reference wetlands and that diatom communities are similar among reference wetlands because communities should be relatively stable over time. Conversely, we predicted that diatom communities in restored and reference wetlands differ because species recovery after restoration may be incomplete or unattainable depending on environmental conditions or dispersal limits. Eight undisturbed, unrestored (reference) wetlands were compared to eight wetlands restored after drainage. Diatom communities on artificial substrates were transplanted from restored to reference wetlands and vice versa to test for environmental control and dispersal limits to community composition. Species richness was similar at restored and reference wetlands. Diversity and equitability at restored and reference sites were similar within a sampling period, but diversity and equitability decreased over the growing season in reference sites. Based on multidimensional scaling analyses, restored and reference sites could not be distinguished by species composition either early or late in the season. Transplanted diatom community assemblages became similar to those in the wetlands to which they were transferred, suggesting a strong environmental control over diatom assemblages. Diatoms, as a whole, responded rapidly to environmental conditions; yet, dispersal still may limit some species' re-establishment, while resistance to disturbance may produce little response among other diatom species. Diatoms may have limited utility as ecological indicators in prairie wetlands because of the unique interaction between diatom life history and the cyclic hydrology of; prairie wetlands and because diatom community structure is highly variable among reference wetlands.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	1999	19	4					765	774		10.1007/BF03161783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161783													WOS:000084526200005
J	MADSEN, JD				MADSEN, JD			RESOURCE-ALLOCATION AT THE INDIVIDUAL PLANT-LEVEL	AQUATIC BOTANY												Although resource allocation studies are well represented in terrestrial plant ecological literature, such studies have been tangential, at best, for submersed aquatic macrophytes. Utilizing data from published studies, trends in the allocation of resources are examined for sexual and asexual propagation of both annual and perennial macrophytes, seasonal patterns in allocation and storage, specialization of structures for storing carbohydrates, and tissue nutrient allocation. The effect of environmental conditions on allocation patterns, leaf shape, and growth form are also discussed. Finally, a cost/benefit model of leaf construction and maintenance costs vs. lifetime yield is presented as an explanation of high leaf turnover rates in productive species.																			0304-3770					AUG	1991	41	1-3					67	86		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90039-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90039-8													WOS:A1991GD57300004
J	Dark, P				Dark, P			Dogs, a crane (not duck) and diet at Star Carr: a response to Schulting and Richards	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												In a recent article in this journal, Schulting and Richards (J Archaeol Sci 29 (2002) 327) present new carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bones from two dogs (Canisfamiliaris) and a common crane (Grus grus) from the early Mesolithic sites of Star Carr and Seamer Carr, in the Vale of Pickering, north-cast England (Excavations at Star Carr (1954); The Mesolithic in Europe (1989) 218). These, they argue, undermine my previous suggestion (J Archaeol Sci 23 (1996) 783) that the delta(13)C values for the Seamer dog obtained by Clutton-Brock and Noe-Nygaard (J Archaeol Sci 17 (1990) 643) could be explained by consumption not of marine foods, as originally interpreted, but from a diet that included foods from the freshwater carbonate-rich lake. Here I discuss Schulting and Richard's new results and conclude that neither of the Vale of Pickering dogs need necessarily have consumed marine foods. Furthermore, the choice of a crane to test my suggestion that animals feeding on foods from the lake could have elevated delta(13)C values is inappropriate because the diet of this bird is unlikely to have included a significant component of freshwater foods. Schulting and Richard's new data do not, therefore, provide evidence for seasonal movement of early Mesolithic human groups between the coast and the inland lake. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gervais, F; Behrendt, H				Gervais, F; Behrendt, H			Primary productivity in a polymictic lake temporal dynamics, controlling factors and trophic state	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The seasonal and interannual dynamics of phytoplankton biomass, underwater light climate and primary productivity were studied in a phytoplankton-dominated, polymictic lake (Muggelsee, Berlin, Germany) from 1994 to 1998. Turbidity was relatively high (k(0) between 0.4 and 2.5 m(-1)) and the mixing depth often exceeded the euphotic depth. Therefore light was the most important factor limiting primary productivity. 82% of the observed variability in photosynthetic carbon uptake could be explained by a linear regression of carbon uptake against the product of chlorophyll a concentration and mean underwater irradiance. Annual productivity showed a rather large interannual variability (carbon uptake: 233-358 g C m(-2) y(-1); net oxygen productivity: 730-1150 g O-2 m(-2) y(-1)) that was clearly related to algal biomass and global radiation. Compared to the 1980s, the mean annual primary productivity has decreased by 33%.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2003	88	1					16	33		10.1002/iroh.200390001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200390001													WOS:000181284900002
J	Hawes, EJ; Parrish, DL				Hawes, EJ; Parrish, DL			Using abiotic and biotic factors to predict the range expansion of white perch in Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												White perch (Morone americana) invaded Lake Champlain, New York-Vermont, in the mid-1980s, yet abundance of white perch and those factors controlling their abundance are unknown. To predict the expansion of white perch, we differentiated between the most likely factors affecting white perch abundance; habitat characteristics or an invasion gradient (i.e., abundance is greater near the point of entry). Therefore, we addressed three questions: 1) where are white perch currently established; 2) what is the relation of white perch abundance to environmental variables and to an invasion gradient; and 3) based on the most likely factors affecting abundance, where will white perch become abundant in Lake Champlain? Fish communities were sampled and ten environmental variables were measured at sites along the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. Among sites and across seasons, two abiotic factors (turbidity and conductivity) had the greatest effect on white perch abundance. Biotic factors, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) abundance and chlorophyll a, however had lesser effects. We predict white perch will not become abundant in habitats with low water conductivity, turbidity and chlorophyll a, and a high abundance of potential competitors. Our predictions are consistent with data from other systems, which indicate environmental characteristics are likely more important than an invasion gradient in contributing to white perch colonization.																			0380-1330						2003	29	2					268	279		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70432-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70432-8													WOS:000183819000006

Dams were built below (Grand Coulee 1942), at the outlet (Keenleyside 1967), and above (Mica 1973 and Revelstoke 1983) the Arrow Lakes, and Mysis relicta were introduced in 1968. The reservoirs created behind the upstream dams act as nutrient traps, reducing the already naturally low levels of nutrients in the Arrow Lakes Reservoir. The objective of nutrient additions to the Arrow Lakes Reservoir was to replace nutrients trapped upstream and was driven by rapidly declining stocks of kokanee, a native landlocked sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka and keystone species of this aquatic ecosystem. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Upper and Lower Arrow tributaries supported between 600,000-800,000 kokanee salmon spawners, but the numbers declined steadily through the 1990s to a low of 97,000 in 1997. As the number of kokanee decreased, no increase in size was observed, consistent with nutrient-limited conditions. Unlike its neighbor, Kootenay Lake, which is one of the most studied in British Columbia, the Arrow Lakes Reservoir had received little limnological attention. After an initial study of the limnology and trophic status in 1997 and 1998, a 5-year fertilization experiment was initiated in 1999 with seasonally adjusted nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) additions to the Upper Arrow Reservoir, in an effort to restore historic kokanee populations. Preliminary data from the first two years of fertilization, 1999 and 2000, show positive and encouraging trends in primary productivity, phytoplankton succession, zooplankton biomass, and the number, size, and fecundity of kokanee spawners. No significant changes have been observed in the water quality parameters measured, consistent with immediate utilization of nutrients in an oligotrophic system.

J	Qiu, S; McComb, AJ; Bell, RW; Davis, JA				Qiu, S; McComb, AJ; Bell, RW; Davis, JA			Nutrient response to soil and litter metabolic activity in a transect across a seasonal wetland	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Many wetlands in the interdunal depression of coastal sand dunes of the Swan Coastal Plain are surrounded by partially vegetated catchments. Although litter can be an important source of nutrients, little is known about litter related microbial activity in these catchments, especially its role in regulating nutrient concentrations in soils during the wet season. Heterotrophic microbial activity and phosphorus (P) dynamics were monitored before and after the onset of the wet season along transects from a vegetated catchment to the lakebed in Thomsons Lake, south-western Australia. Microbial activity was measured in the field as CO2 efflux (range from 47 to 176 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) and in the laboratory as substrate-induced-respiration (SIR; range from 11 to 133 mug g(-1) h(-1)). Substrate-induced-respiration was positively correlated with soil organic content, and was concentrated in surface soils. In contrast, in the exposed lakebed most microbial biomass was below the surface, in the 10-30 cm depth zone. There were significant changes in nutrient dynamics in response to soil microbial activity. Before rain, P extracted by anion exchange membrane (P-AEM) was well correlated with site litter and plant debris (r(2) = 0.90, P < 0.001), suggesting that P-AEM in soils was litter-sourced. This relationship was modified during the wet season: there was an overall increase in microbial biomass P (P-MB; from average 7.5 mu g g(-1) to 21.6 mu g g(-1)), and a decrease in P-AEM:P-MB in surface soils. Along the study transect, the assimilation index P-AEM:P-MB declined towards the wetland, where soils were more silty and organic, and CO2 production was significantly higher. Our data suggest that heterotrophic microbial activity has a significant role in regulating P flux from catchment litter during the wet season, which would affect the mobility of litter-sourced P from catchment to the wetland.
